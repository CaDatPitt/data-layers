the invention of the cotton-gin revolutionized the industries
of the South, while that of the magnetic telegraph marked
an epoch in human civilization.

Then dreadful war came once more. The United States
had gained its independence; it had Won a place in 1812
among nations, and it now remained to purge itself of the
poison—African s1avery—of I619. The bombardment of
Fort Sumter opened the most tremendous war of modern
times; Gettysburg saw the life and death grapple of the
Union and Confederate hosts, and at Appomattox the sun of
the Southern Confederacy set never to rise again. Slavery
and secession died, and the country, re—united and free from
ocean to ocean, entered upon the grand career which has
given her a most exalted place among the peoples of the
earth.

the mortiﬁcation of handing his sword to his con-
queror. When O’Hara came opposite Washington,
who was sitting on his charger, he saluted and
apologized for the absence of Cornwallis, who he
said was ill. He offered his sword to Washington,
who replied that he had assigned to General
Lincoln the duty of receiving the submission of the
troops. There was a poetical justice in this, for
during the previous year, Lincoln had been sub-
jected to the humiliation of giving up his sword to
Clinton, when he captured Charleston.

Lincoln conducted the captured army to an open
ﬁeld and gave the order to “ground arms.” It is
said that many of the British soldiers were so
angry that they ﬂung down their muskets with a
violence that broke them. Then they were
marched back to Yorktown.

The forces surrendered included over eight thou-
sand English and Hessian soldiers and sailors. In
addition to the accoutrements of the army, seventy-
ﬁve brass and thirty-one iron guns were taken. A
courier mounted a swift horse and setting out for
Philadelphia, where Congress was in session,
thrilled every one with the glorious news when
he reached that city at two o‘clock in the morning.

The triumph at Yorktown was the decisive
victory of the Revolution and secured the indepen-
dence of the United States of America.

burned for a time, and there was some ﬁghtingin

that he insisted upon continuing his attempts to
conquer his colonies, but Parliament would not
consent, and was so emphatic in its demand for
peace that the stubborn monarch had to yield.
The treaty was signed ‘in 1783. Great Britain
acknowledged the United States as a ‘free and
independent nation, and ﬁxed Canada as the
boundary on the north, the Mississippi River on
the west, and Florida, reaching west to the Miss-
issippi, on the south.

And so independence was won at last. The

appeared before Congress at Annapolis and resigned
his commission. The thirteen States that had
fought so bravely were free, but they were in
a woeful condition. Commerce, manufacturing
and trade were ruined and the whole nation was
reduced to poverty.

Worse than all, there was no real government.
The States had kept together and fought shoulder
to shoulder, but each was independent of the
others, and did as it pleased. They sent delegates
to the Continental Congress which managed pub-
lic aﬁairs during the war. It had governed to a
certain extent, but possessed no actual authority.
The utmost that it could do was to recommend the
respective States to take certain steps, and such
States obeyed or disobeyed as it preferred. Still
there was a certain obedience so long as the danger
from the British lasted, but when that danger grew
less, the State governments swung loose, until
Congress found itself a governing body without
any power to govern.

In view of this peril, Congress adopted in 1777,
the Articles of Confederation, which stated in
exact terms the authority of Congress. This was

to prevent the State government from interfering,

and it was provided that the Articles should not
go into effect until agreed to by all the States.
Such agreement was made by twelve of the States

98 E/605/zs in Ame1rz'ca7z Hzktory.

within the following two years, but Maryland
waited until March, 1781, before giving her
assent. Then they became operative and speedily
proved worthless.

The Articles of Confederation made Congress
the one governing power, but took from it the
authority to lay taxes, regulate commerce or
punish violation of the law. It could simply ad-
vise the States what to do, and as has been said,
the States paid little heed to such advice. Imagine
what sort of school a teacher would have who
could only suggest, but not enforce his rules!

But we had men in those days who were great
and wise in statesmenship as well as in war.
They saw the difficulty and consulted and ponder-
ed long over it. They knew that the whole
country would go to ruin, and anarchy would
reign everywhere unless steps were taken to
provide it with a strong central government, which
could enforce its laws to the remotest corners of
the land. Washington, Hamilton and Madison
were among the foremost in considering the grave
situation, and all admitted that something decisive
must be done very soon.

These sagacious men agreed that a convention

' of delegates from the respective States could best

do the work, for neither Congress nor the State
legislatures had p'r'dve‘d equal to the task. An

Epoc/zs 2'72 Amei/z'ccm Hzktory. 99

attempt was made to hold such a convention at
Annapolis in 1786, but ﬁve States only sent
delegates and nothing was done. Success, however,
came the following year, when Congress approved
the call for a convention, for every State except
Rhode Island elected delegates, who met in Phil-
adelphia in May, 1787. It was composed of the
ablest men in the country. Washington headed
the Virginia delegation, and by unanimous vote
was chosen president of the convention.

The body met in Independence Hall, in the
same room where the Declaration of Independence
had been signed, and where maystill be seen the
chair in which VVashington sat while serving as
presiding ofﬁcer. Among the members were
Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, Alexander
Hamilton, Benjamin West, Edmund Randolph,
Robert Morris, Gouverneur Morris, and others.
They sat with closed doors and for four months
earnestly discussed the principles of government.

One grave difficulty was the fear of what was
then the small states, New York, New Jersey,
New Hampshire, Delaware and Maryland, that too
much power would be given to the general govern-
ment, and that it would oppress them. Some of
the southern states wished to continue the slave
trade, and it was agreed that it should be permitted
for twenty years. At last the Constitution was

100 E17505/25 2'72 A merzmiz Hzklory.

completed, and, on the 147th of September, 1787, it
was signed by all the delegates except Gerry, of
Massachusetts, and Randolph and Mason, of Vir-
ginia. Then it was submitted to Congress, which
in turn submitted it to the respective States
for their acceptance or rejection. It could not
become operative until ratiﬁed by nine of the
States.

It was inevitable that much opposition should
develop. It 111ay be said that among these dis-
cussions appeared the germs of the two leading
political parties, which have since alternated in
ruling the country. There was a dread by some
of giving the central or general government too
much power, and thus dwarﬁng the authority

which they conceived rightfully belonged to the'

States. Those who took this view called them-
selves Democrats. Those who maintained that the
general government should be strengthened to the
uttermost were Federalists.

Gradually the Constitution received the assent
of one State after the other. On the 21st of June,
New Hampshire, the ninth, ratiﬁed it, and it
therefore became the supreme law of the land.
Virginia and New York followed within a few
weeks, but North Carolina and Rhode Island held
out. These States had issued paper money and
opposed the Constitution because it forbade any

Epoc/zs 2'72 /177rzerz'ca7z Hzkioij/. 101

State to do that. The dread that the new Federal

Government would have too much power led to.

the adoption of the ﬁrst ten Amendments to the
Constitution which were ratiﬁed in 1791. North
Carolina accepted the Constitution in 1789 and
Rhode Island in 1790.

Every boy and girl should become familiar
with the leading features of the Constitution of
their country, for it is the wisest instrument
ever framed for the government of any people.
It may be found in almost any text book of
United States history.

Our government consists of three departments,
legislative, executive and judicial. The legisla-
tive includes a Senate and House of Representa-
tives, which together constitute Congress. This
body makes the laws for the country at large.
The members of the House of Representatives
are chosen by the people every two years, and are
apportioned among the States according to their
population, a census being taken every ten
years. This, it will be seen, gives the
n1ore populous States a just representation in
Congress.

To protect the smaller States, it is provided
that each, without regard to its population, shall
be entitled to two Senators who are elected for
a term of six years each.’ They are chosen

102 Eﬁocﬁs in /.lmerz'am Hzklory.

by the respective legislatures and represent the

P States in their sovereign capacity.

The two houses unitedly lay taxes, borrow
money, regulate commerce, coin money, establish
post offices, declare war, raise armies, build navies
and support them, while no State is allowed to do
any of these things, except to employ its own
militia to suppress rioting and insurrection, lay
its own taxes and borrow on its own account.

A majority vote is sufficient to pass any bill,
but when it is vetoed or objected to by the Pres-
ident, a two-thirds vote is necessary to make it a
law. The treaties made by the President cannot
become valid until approved by two-thirds of the
members of the Senate.

The President forms the executive department,
that is to say, it is his duty to enforce the laws
made by the Congress. He is elected every four
years, by electors Whom the people choose. He is
Commander-in-chief of the army and navy, and
appoints the majority of the public officers, the
majority of such appointments not being valid
until approved by the Senate. If the President
misconduct himself while in office, he may be im-
peached or accused by the House of the Represen-
tatives, and tried by the Senate. A President is
eligible for any number of terms; but since
Washington refused a third election, it has become

Epoc/zs 2'72 Amerzkan Hzktory. 103

the “unwritten law” of the land that no President
shall hold the office longer than two terms.

If the President die, resign, or is removed,
he is succeeded by the Vice-President, who, except
in this contingency, is simply to preside over the
Senate, with the privilege of casting the deciding
vote in case of a tie. A late amendment to the
Constitution provides that if both the President
and the Vice-President die, they shall be succeeded
by the Secretary of State, the order of succession
being after him, the Secretaries of Treasury and
War, the Attorney-General, the Post-Master Gen-
eral and the Secretary of the Navy and Interior
until other provisions are made.

The Judiciary department is vested in the
Supreme Court and such inferior courts as
Congress may establish. This court is the highest
tribunal in the land, and decides whether or not
the laws passed by Congress are in harmony with
the Constitution. If they are not, then such laws
are null and void. The Judges are appointed by
the President with the consent of the Senate and
hold ofﬁce for life or during good behaviour. The
question as to the constitutionality of a law is first
passed upon by the inferior courts. Then, if
either of the parties is dissatisﬁed, he can appeal
to the Supreme Court, whose decision is ﬁnal.

Such are the main features of the Constitution

which was framed and adopted in 1787. It has
undergone many important amendments since
that time, as the exigencies demanded, but its
leading principles will remain through ages
to come.

In 1872, Congress enacted that the State election
should be held in all States on the first Tuesday
next after the ﬁrst Monday in November of each
year, afterwards exempting such States as had
ﬁxed upon another day. In every State, however,
except Oregon, Vermont and Maine, the elections
are held at the time named.

presses, and in agricultural machines, sewing
machines, type writers, the cotton gin, the steam-
boat, the electromagnetic telegraph and those con-
nected vvith electricity. Numerous and valuable as
these are, it is likely that other inventions yet re-
main to be made that will be as important.

106 Epochs in Amerzkaiz Hzktory.

Eli Whitney was”born in Massachusetts, Decem-
ber 8, 1765, and was graduated from Yale College
when a young man. He was in poor circumstances,
and, moving into the South, he made his home in
Savannah, Georgia, where he took up the study of
law. He possessed an inventive ability, but seems
hardly to have been aware of it, for he made no

effort to think out any new machine, until the sug-'

gestion was made to him by the
lady with whom he boarded.

In no part of the world does
cotton grow more luxuriantly
than in the South. The soil
and climate are exactly adapted
to it, and cotton will always
form one of the leading indus-
tries of that section. At the
time, however, that Whitney
was studying law in Savannah, few people raised
cotton, for it could not be made proﬁtable. Every
ball or pod contains a number of small seeds,
which are so interwoven with the ﬁbre, that it is
hard to separate them by the hands. When the
most expert slave was set at the task, he could not
clean more than a-pound of cotton of its seeds
in the course of a whole day. Now, since the
pound is worth only a few cents, it will be seen
that its cultivation could never be made to pay

 

Epoc/zs 2'72 'Amer2'am Hzktory. 107

so longas the old method of freeing it from seed
was used.

“Mr. Whitney,” said his landlady one day, “why
don’t you try to invent a machine that will separate
seed from the cotton?”

“I have never thought of it,” he replied.

“Then think of it, for, if you can make an inven-

.tion of that kind, you will become one of the richest

men in the country.”

An incentive of that sort is enough to set any
person to thinking, and young Whitney withdrew
his thoughts from the study of law, and bent them
upon the new problem. By and by, the possibili-
ties of the invention dawned upon him: he believed
he would succeed.

But he met trying difﬁculties from the ﬁrst. He

had to make his own tools and draw his own wire. .

This was tedious work, but the invention crystal-
lized in his mind a11d he wrought at it from early
morning till late at night, and often lay awake for
hours, with his brain stirred by the new ideas that
ﬁlled it.

Wliitney saw that it was necessary to keep his
secret. If he did not, others would steal his ideas,
and rob him of all the fame and proﬁt. He allowed
no one to see what he was doing, except his land-
lady and a young man named Miller, whom he
fully trusted.

In some way, however, it leaked out that Whit-
ney was working on an invention that would be of
great help in the culture of cotton. The people
in the town were very curious, and tried to geta
peep at him when he was in the shed near the
house, which had been set apart for a workshop.
But he would not allow any one to enter, and noth-
ing could be learned from Miller or the landlady. .

THE FIRST COTTON GIN.

Gradually the machine approached completion.
He knew that it would do the work he had in mind,
and, while simple in its nature, would prove one of
the greatest inventions of the age. As soon as it
was light, Whitney was in his workshop, which he
scarcely left for his meals and not until late at
night. A little while longer and the wonderful
contrivance would be ﬁnished.

Epoc/zs 2'72 Amerztan Hzklory. 109

One morning, he hurried out to his little shop
and opened the door, hopeful and happy, for his
work was near its end. To his dismay the machine
was gone! Some persons had broken into the shop
during the night and stolen it. His secret was out
and there was no Way of ﬁnding who the thieves Were.

But Whitney did not believe in “crying over
spilt milk.” He set to work with renewed energy
and in time completed another machine. Before he
could do so, several others formed on the same
principle were in operation. Whitney and Miller
Went to Connecticut, and in 1793 began manufact-
uring machines for the South.

The word “Gin,” as applied to this invention,
is a shortening of the word “engine.” Its composi-
tion is so simple that a child can understand its
workings. It may be said that it consists of beds
of wires strung close together, between which pass
the sharp teeth of a number of thin circular Saws.
These teeth tear out the seeds from the cotton de-
posited above. Its immense effectiveness is shown
in the fact that one man in a day can clean as much
cotton as three thousand men under the old method.
The machine is so simple, that one cannot help
wondering that it was not thought of long before.

The patent was obtained by Whitney, for no one
could dispute that he was the inventor, but its value
was so enormous that other persons continually

110 Epocks 2'72 A merzkcm Hzklory.

made the machines without his permission and sold
them to the planters. It cost Whitney a great deal
of money to prosecute these men who infringed
upon his rights, and he was unable to stop the
practice. Many thousand dollars that belonged to
him he never saw. When the time came to renew
his patent, the pressure from the southern mem-
bers was so strong, that Congress refused to grant
the renewal.

 

PULLING COTTON SEEDS.

The injustice to Whitney was so marked that
some of the States were shamed into making some
sort of amends. North Carolina paid him a per-
centage for ﬁve years on all the cotton gins used
in the State. South Carolina agreed to pay him
ﬁfty thousand dollars for the invention, but Whit-
ney had to spend a greater part of the sum in a suit
against the State before he could recover it. Ten-
nessee promised to allow a percentage, but failed to
keep her agreement. Finally Whitney’s factory

Epocks 2'72 American ffz'sz‘07j/. 111

burned down, his partner Miller died and all his
money and his rights in his great invention
vanished.

But no misfortune could rob him of his pluck
and the inventive faculty with which nature had
endowed him. He turned his attention to the
manufacture of ﬁrearms for the government, mak-
ing a number of inventions which were so valuable
that in a short time he became a wealthy man.

No invention ever made was so far reaching in
its effects upon this country as the cotton gin.
With its introduction in the South, the cultivation
of cotton seemed to start up everywhere. At cer-
tain seasons it looked as if the whole country was
covered with snow, and the songs of the thousands

of slaves were heard, as they picked the beautiful ‘

white clusters and carried them in baskets to where
the cotton gins were waiting to tear out the seeds
from the ﬁbre faster than the snowy loads could be
emptied into its capacious mouth.

It is thought by many that but for the invention
of the cotton gin, there never would have been a
civil war, such as prevailed from 1861 to 1865. The
culture of cotton made the South rich and prosper-
ous. There was a continual and growing demand
for cotton, not only in this country, but from abroad.
Four-ﬁfths of the cotton used in England comes
from this country. The South grew strong and

was conﬁdent of success, when its States attempted
to secede from the Union. They believed, too, that
Great Britain’s distress, when deprived of the sup-
ply from this side of the ocean, would cause her
openly to take the part of the South in that trem-
endous struggle. The invention of Eli Whitney
wrought one of the greatest revolutions that has
ever taken place in the United States.

THE STEAM BOAT.

   

__ S long ago
as 1690, a
man named
P a p i n
, W. _ printed a

 I book in
i‘ ' " ' whichhe
I ' urgedthe
use of
steam as
a motive power. He not only gave a rude drawing
of a steamboat with paddle wheels, but built one,
which he tried in 1707, on the river F ulda, near
Cassel. It must have been a failure for nothing
111ore was heard of it.

In 1736,Jonathan Hulls made a steamboat, with
a stern wheel, which was intended for towing pur-
poses, and in 1763, William Henry succeeded in
moving a boat by steam on the Conestoga Creek in
Pennsylvania. In 1784, Rumsey, an American in-
ventor, forced a boat through the water, by means
of a jet of water driven out of the stern by pumps
which_ were Worked by steam. John Fitch met

Missing Page

 

114 Epochs 23¢ Americcm Hzktory.

with still greater success in 1787, when he placed
a steamboat on the Delaware river, which ran at
the rate of four miles an hour. It made a number
of trips to Burlington, twenty miles up stream,
and it has been claimed that he ascended to
Trenton, a dozen miles further, and at the head
of navigation. Fitch formed a company, but they
seem to have become -discouraged, for the pro-
ject was given up and Fitch died in the depths of
poverty.

In 1789, Nathan Read built a steamboat, with
whi'ch he made several short trips, and three years
later Elijah Ormsbee slowly moved about the
Pawtucket river for fully a month in a steamboat.
But he, too, was poor, and could not persuade any-
one to help him. In 1797, Morey launched another
steamboat, at Bordentown, New Jersey, in which
he made a voyage to Philadelphia, having the cur-
rent with him all the way. It had a wheel on each
side and was moved by a crank in the centre.
Morey died in 1843, and always declared that
Robert Fulton stole his ideas from him.

Still more remarkable is the fact that Captain
John Stevens, of Hoboken, New Jersey, about the
close of the last century, built a boat, which he pro-
posed to drive by twin screws, worked by a high-
pressure engine. The machinery made by Captain
Stevens may be seen to day in the Stevens Institute.

Eﬁoc/zs 2'72 Amerz'ca7z Hzkiory. 115

It is strange that nearly a half century passed be-
fore his idea was adopted.

Now, how much Robert Fulton had heard of
these experiments and how much aid he got from
them cannot be known. It has been said that
nothing succeeds like success, and since he was the
ﬁrst man to succeed with steamboat navigation, full
credit n1ust be given to him.

He was born in Fulton, Pennsylvania, in 1765.
He early showed an aptitude for drawing and paint-
ing. His skill in this respect, when he was study-
ing in Philadelphia, attracted the attention of
Benjamin Franklin, and he went to London where
he studied under the patronage of the famous painter,
Benjamin West, who years afterwards was the
teacher of Professor Morse. West introduced
Fulton to two noblemen who interested him in the
construction of canals and steam navigation. Ful-
ton gave the matter much thought, and it is claimed
that it was he who first formed the idea of connect-
ing the Great Lakes by means of a canal with the
headwaters of the Hudson.

Fulton visited Paris in 1797, and became intim-
ate with joel Barlow, the American poet and
diplomat, who was as deeply interested as he in

steamboats and canals. Barlow returned to this

country in 1805, and made his home near Wash-
ington, where he was joined by Fulton at the

116 Epoc/zs 2'72 American Hzklory.

beginning of 1807. Fulton now bent all his ener-
gies toward making a steamboat which would not
only move through the water at a fair rate of speed,
but would be successful in a commercial sense.
The inventor throughout all his labors had the
valuable help of Robert R. Livingston, who was
American minister to the French court at the time
of Fulton’s visit to France. He was a man of
means and provided the inventor with the funds,
without which he never would have attained success.

Fulton and Livingston decided to have a strong
engine built and the experiment made on the Hud-
son. A contract with a ﬁrm in Birmingham,
England, called for the delivery of such an engine
in America in 1805, but it did not reach this country
until the following year. The hull was constructed
on this side of the ocean. Livingston and Fulton
secured from the legislature the exclusive privilege
of navigating the waters of the State by steam for
a period of twenty years, the conditions being that
a boat of that kind should be put in operation, be-
fore April, 1807, and that it should be capable of a
speed of four miles an hour.

The building of this boat was begun at the ship
yard of Charles Brown, on the East River. The
length was one hundred and thirty feet, width
sixteen and one half, depth four feet, and burden one
hundred and sixty tons. The diameter of the

Epocﬁs in Amerzkan 117219107’)/. 117

wheels was ﬁfteen feet, and they were four feet
long with a dip of two feet. The boiler was eight
feet wide and slightly more than twenty feet in
length. The steam cylinder was two feet long and
/had a stroke of four feet. I

In August, 1807, the trial trip was made in the
presence of a large number of invited guests. A
spectator thus describes the event:

“Nothing could exceed the surprise and admira-
tion of all who witnessed the experiment. The
minds of the most incredulous were changed in a
few minutes. Before the boat had made the pro-
gress of a quarter of a mile, the greatest unbeliever
must have been converted. The man who, while
he looked on the expensive machine, thanked his
stars that he had more wisdom than to waste his
money on such idle schemes, changed the expres-
sion of his features as the boat moved from the
wharf and gained her speed; his complacent smile
gradually stiffened into an expression of wonder.
The jeers of the ignorantgwho had neither sense
nor feeling enough to suppress their contemptous
ridicule and rude jokes, were silenced for a moment
by astonishment, which deprived them of the power
of utterance, till the triumph of genius extorted
from the incredulous multitude, which crowded the
shores, shouts and acclamations of congratulations
and applause.”

118 Efoc/zs 2'12 Amerz'ca7z Hzkfory.

Fulton found on this trial trip that the paddles
dipped too deeply in the water. He raised them to
the proper height and straightway a marked im-
provement in speed followed.

The experiment had proved a triumphant success
and caused the greatest wonder and admiration.
While working at the craft, Fulton had been ridi-
culed by nearly every one. His boat was named
“FuZt0n’s Folly,” by the ignorant masses, and not
one in a thousand believed anything but failure

awaited him. But the plucky American never lost '

faith in his ideas, and did not falter in carrying
them through. Like Morse he was fortunate in
having good ﬁnancial backing, beside which his
friends included some of the ablest men in the
country.

Fulton named the boat the Clermom‘, as a com-
pliment to Chancellor Livingston’s country seat on
the’ Hudson. Then he advertised that the steam-
boat would carry passengers and freight regularly
between Albany and New York. The ﬁrst trip was
made on Monday, August 11, 1807.

The start was from New York at one o’clock in
the afternoon, and just twenty-four hours later, the
boat arrived at Clermont, the distance being one
hundred and ten miles. It left Clermont at nine
o’clock on Wednesday and reached Albany at ﬁve
o’clock in the afternoon. The whole distance of

Epoc/25 2'72 A merz'az7z Hzklory. 119

one hundred and ﬁfty miles was made in thirty-
two hours. The return trip occupied thirty hours.
Mr. H. Freeland who witnessed that remarkable
voyage, gives the following description, written in
1856 : _
“In the early autumn of the year 1807, a knot of
villagers was gathered on a high bluﬁ just opposite
Poughkeepsie on the west bank of the Hudson, at-
tracted by the appearance of a strange, dark-looking
craft, which was slowly making its way up the
river. Some imagined it to be a sea monster, while
others did not hesitate to express their opinion that

it was a sign of the approaching judgment. What 1

seemed strange in the vessel was the substitution
of a lofty and strange black smoke pipes, rising
from the deck instead of the gracefully tapered
masts that commonly stood on the vessels navi-
gating the stream, and, in place of the spars and
rigging, the curious play of the walking beam and
pistons, and the slow turning and splashing of the
huge and naked paddle wheels met the astonished

gaze. The dense clouds of smoke, as they rose.

wave upon wave, added still more to the wonder of
the rustics.

“This strange looking craft was the C lermomf on
her trial trip to Albany; and of the little knot of
villagers above mentioned-, the writer, then a boy
in his eighth year, with his parents, formed a part;

120 Epoc/zs in Ameriam Hzklory.

I well remember the scene, one so well ﬁtted to im-
press a lasting picture upon the 111ind of a child
accustomed to watch the vessels that pass up and
down the river. The forms of four persons were
distinctly visible on the deck as she passed the
bluﬁ‘—one of whom doubtless was Robert Fulton,
who had on board with him all the cherished hopes
of years, the most precious cargo the wonderful
boat could carry. On her return trip the curiosity
she excited was scarcely less intense-—the whole
country talked of nothing but the sea monster
belching forth ﬁre and smoke. The ﬁshermen be-
came terriﬁed and rowed homeward; for they saw
nothing but destruction devastating their ﬁshing
grounds; while the wreaths of black vapor and
rushing noise of the paddle wheels, foaming with
the stirred-up waters, produced great excitement
among the boatmen until the character of that
curious boat, and the nature of the enterprise she
was pioneering, had been ascertained.”

Fulton added many improvements to the Cler-
mom‘. His success roused the jealously of the
owners of sailing vessels, but the new and novel
boat was well patronized, It will be surprising in
these days to hear that an injunction was sued out
against Fulton to prevent his boat running on the
Hudson, the claim being that the navigation of the
river belonged to the owners of the sailing craft.

Epocﬁs 2'72 Amei/{can Hzktory. 121

Daniel Webster was one of Fulton’s counsel and
of course won the case for him.

Baffled in this direction, there was many treacher-
ous attempts to injure the Clermont. She was
repeatedly run into and fouled by the heavy sailing
vessels, until at last an appeal was made to the
legislature, which promptly responded by adding
ﬁve years to the exclusive privilege of Fulton and
Livingston for every new boat they added, provided
the entire term did not exceed thirty years. It
was enacted further that all combinations to destroy
the Clermom‘ or any other steamboat, or to injure
them in any way, should be punishable by ﬁne and
imprisonment. Nothing, however, that could be
done to annoy Fulton and Livingston was neglec-
ted. The patents were continually attacked,
exclusive privileges were declared a monopoly
and the most determined attempts were made to
overthrow it.

Despite all these obstacles, the Clermom‘ soon
began running as a regular packet between New
York and Albany, making the round trip in seventy-
two hours, while the sailing packets consumed
from four to seven days. Another boat was added
in 1808, a third three years later, after which they
came faster. The fare each way was seven dollars.
Now the trip may be made in a single day or night
for one dollar.

Down to the war of 1812, the only way to cross
the North and East Rivers was by horse boats.
These were propelled by horses, walking round with
a shaft on the boat, and thus turning the paddle
wheels. The ferriage was four cents. In the year
named, Fulton completed two ferry boats for the
North River, following with others for the East
River. They resembled in the main the boats of
to-day, moving backward as well as forwardwith
facility. He invented also the movable dock, which
prevents a violent shock when the boats enter the
slips. In calm weather the trip of a mile and a
half was made in ﬁfteen minutes.

The Szwamza/z was the first steamship to cross
the Atlantic. Her shaft (as stated in our history
of the magnetic telegraph) was laid at the Speed-
well Iron works, near Morristown, New Jersey.
She was of three hundred tons burden and was com-
manded by Captain Moses Rogers. She left New
York, injune, 1819, and in nine days was at Savan-
nah, Georgia. Then she headed across the Atlantic
and sighted the coast of Ireland twenty-ﬁve days later.
During eight days of her voyage, the Savanna/2 un-
shipped her wheels and used only her sails. The
Royal PVz'/Zzkmz was the second steamer to cross,
which she did in 1831, and two years later anEnglish
steamer of the same name made the voyage from
Liverpool to New York, using steam all the way.

Epoc/zs in A meriecm Hzktory. 123
After the second Royal PVZY/zkzm, the Liver-

pool crossed to this country in seventeen days
and returned in ﬁfteen. The Sz'rz'us and Great
I/Veszfern ran a famous race in 1838. Dr.
Dionysius Gardner, one of the greatest scientists
of Europe, proved as he claimed that the Great
Western could never cross the ocean, but it did,
despite his proof.

Ten years later the New York Collins steam-
ers began their voyages and shared with the
Cunard and other lines the patronage of the
public on both sides of the ocean. The new
method of propulsion was rapidly introduced on
the lakes and western rivers, until there is
scarcely a stream in the country of navigable
size upon which craft impelled by steam may
not be found. Robert Fulton died in February,
1815.

itself. Thus a dispatch leaving New York for
San Francisco at noon, will reach that city at nine
o'clock on the same forenoon. No one can estimate
the great civilizing work done by the telegraph.

A half a century ago one of the most popular
text books in our schools was Morse’s Geography.
The author was a clergymen, who lived in Charles-
town, Massachusetts. There, on April 27, 1791,
he had a son born to him whom he named Samuel
Finley Breese. While still a boy, he showed
marked talent for drawing, and, after his gradua-
tion from Yale College, he went to Europe and
studied painting under a great artist. He became
very skillful and many of his works are preserved
and admired at the present time.

While Morse was a student at college, a remark
of his teacher turned his attention to electricity of
which little was known. In 1832, while he was on
the packet Sully sailing from Havre to New York,
he became more interested in the subject and drew
a design in his sketch-book of an apparatus for re-
cording signals at a distance by electromagnetism.
The idea, however, was vague, but it was the germ of
a great discovery or invention,and drew the thoughts
of Morse in that direction more strongly than before.

It may be said that Morse became a man of one

‘ idea. Had he possessed the means, he would have

given up everything and concentrated his thoughts

126 Epoc/zs 2'72 Amerz'ca7z Hzklory.

and energies upon the one subject in which he was
so profoundly interested. Such men are rarely
successful when they make efforts in other direc-
tions, because their thoughts are elsewhere. Hav-
mg no money, Morse had to ﬁnd means of earning

‘food. In 1835, he was appointed Professor in the
department of Literature of the Arts of Design, in
the University of New Yoék, which had been re-
cently established, and was provided with quarters
in the building.

Even with these helps, he came near starving to
death. He had but few pupils in painting, and one
of them tells how, after the professor had taken
dinner with him, he remarked that it was the first
meal he had eaten in twenty-four hours.

But these sufferings did not draw Morse’s mind
away from the great work upon which he had bent
his energies for years. One of the professors in the
University was Leonard D. Gale. In January,
1837, Morse showed to him a crude model which he
had made in which was exempliﬁed the principle of
the recording telegraph. Gale was deeply inter-
ested in the machine, and fron1 his knowledge of
the subject, was able to _ make several valuable
suggestions to Morse.

On Saturday, September 2, 1837, Morse invited
a number of persons to the University to witness
the working of his electromagnetic telegraph. He

Epoc/zs 2'72 Amerzkam Hzktory. 127

had set up his apparatus, with several hundred feet
of copper wire strung back and forth along the
walls of the room. Through this wire he sent
signals and aroused the wondering curiosity of the
spectators.

Among these was a young man named Alfred
Vail, who had been a student at the University,

where he was preparing for the ministry. His
fBther was the proprietor of the Speedwell Iro11
Works, near Morristown, New Jersey, and was
wealthy. It was at these works that the shaft of
the Savanna/2, the ﬁrst steamer to cross the Atlan-
tic (18l9), was forged. Young Vail had a talent

128 Epocﬁs in Ameriam Hzklory.

for the natural sciences, and after the exhibition
was over, he sought out Morse and talked with him
about his invention. Morse told him that his
present difficulty was the lack of money with which
to perfect, patent and bring his machine before the
world. Vail saw the marvelous possibilities of the
telegraph, and agreed to advance him the sum of
two thousand dollars for one-fourth interest in the
invention. Morse gladly accepted the offer and a
contract to that effect was signed September 23, 1837.

The model was removed to the Speedwell Works,
near Morristown and young Vail, with the help of
William Baxter began constructing a new model,
which should include several needed improvements.
Baxter was a boy, hardly ﬁfteen years old, but he
possessed remarkable mechanical ability, and after-
wards was the inventor of the well known Baxter
Steam Engine an.d a number of other important
machines. The model which was first made by

Morse was a clumsy, awkward affair, and may be-

seen to—day in the ofﬁce of the Western Union
Telegraph Company, in New York.
Vail and Baxter wrought long and hard over the

new contrivance, sometimes hopeful and again al- ,

most in despair. But it was completed at last, and,
on the 10th and 11th of January, 1838, was pub-
licly exhibited at Morristown, at which time mes-
sages were sent through three miles of wire. On

Epoc/zs 2'72 Anzerzkan Hzkt07j/. 129

the 23rd of the same month, it was shown in New
York in the same room in the University, where
Professor Gale ﬁrst viewed it. A few days later its
workings were explained to a committee of the
Franklin Institute in Philadelphia and they were
delighted with the results.

Morse busied himself in securing his patents for
the telegraph. What he specially needed was an
appropriation by Congress for the building of an
experimental line with which to demonstrate the
possibilities of the invention. The machine was
exhibited before a committee of Congress, and,
while some of the members were indiﬁferent or
openly ridiculed it, others had intelligence enough
to discern its great merits. A bill was introduced
into the House appropriating thirty thousand dol-
lars for the erection of a telegraph line between
Washington and Baltimore. It passed after much
opposition and went to the Senate where in the last
hour of the session, March 3rd, 1843,it also passed.

Success now seemed assured and work was begun
at once. Instead of stringing the wires to poles,
they were run through pipes laid under ground.
Ezra Cornell, afterward the founder of Cornell
University, made a pipe laying machine which
worked well and he directed the operations.

Vail carried the apparatus and kept up constant
communication as the wire was laid with Morse in

130 E1606/zs 2'12 Ame;/z'ca7z Hzkiory.

Washington. Both were disturbed over the fact
that as the distance increased the insulation grew
weaker. When Vail was ten miles out it disap-
peared altogether.

All those engaged were ﬁlled with dismay. For
they did not know what to do. In order to give an
excuse for suspending the work, Cornell broke the
pipe—laying machine. This prevented the news-
papers from suspecting the real cause. He and
Morse and Vail had many long consultations, but
it was a good while before they could ﬁx upon any
plan. Finally they decided to string the wires
from poles. They began the work with renewed
vigor April 1, 1844. As it progressed, Vail and
Morse continually tested the insulation and were
delighted to ﬁnd it perfect. The whole forty miles
were ﬁnished May 23rd, without the slightest
mishap. ,

On the 24th of May, 1844, Miss Annie Ellsworth,
standing at the elbow of Professor Morse in Wash-
ington, dictated the message, “What hath God
wrought,” and it was received by Vail in Baltimore.
This telegram is preserved among the treasures of
the Connecticut Historical Society.

The National Democratic Convention met in
Baltimore and, on the 29th of May, nominated
James K. Polk for the presidency. Hardly was the
nomination made, when there was a rush for the

Epoc/25 2'7/z Americcm Hzktory. 131

train which reached Washington about an hour and
a half later. Tl1e passengers were eager to tell the
news, but to their astonishment, when they reached
the capital, they found that everybody had known
it almost as soon as they. It had been telegraphed
from Baltimore and the message was the ﬁrst
public one sent by magnetic telegraph.

The invention was so remarkable that for a time
people seemed unable to realize the truth about it.
During the first four days that the ofﬁces were

 

opened in Washington and Baltimore, the receipts
amounted to less than half a dollar, and at the end
of the month they were less than two dollars. The
ﬁrst city to furnish men and money for the
erection of a line was Rochester, New York.
Other cities soon followed until the extent of the
telegraph system is inconceivable. .
Professor Morse received the honors which had
so long been denied him. Prussia, France, Spain,
Turkey, Denmark and other countries gave him the

132 'Ef0c/25 2'72 Aﬂzerzkan Hzkiory.

’ _highest tributes, and, at a congress of the ten

powers of Europe, one hundred thousand dollars
was presented to him as an expression of gratitude.
A monument was unveiled to his memory in
Central Park, in 1871, erected as is set forth by
“the telegraphic brotherhood of the world.” Chief
Justice Chase presided at a grand banquet and
public reception given in his honor at the Academy
of Music. He died April 2, 1872.

The extent of the telegraph system is all over
the world.

In 1890 there were employed in Brazil, 1,418 per-
sons; British India, 6,611; Great Britian and Ire-
land, 117,989; Japan, 7,140; New Zealand, 1,154;
the Phillipine Islands, 473 ; Russia, 3,885; Egypt,
172; China, 70.

When it was sought to introduce the telegraph
into China, it was a long time before the people
could see any value in it. But there were a few
enterprising persons in that country who made use
of its advantages and it has gradually gained favor
and made its way through the principal parts of the
kingdom. , '

A great difficulty lay in the fact that the Chinese
use over thirty thousand characters in writing their
language. The problem of providing an alphabet
was submitted to a Danish professor who had
studied the language for recreation. He selected

Epoc/zs in Amerzkaiz Hzkiory. 133

six thousand characters in common use, and ap-
plied to each an arrangement of dots and dashes,
by which means he gave to every character an in-
dividual telegraphic symbol. Then a small tele-
graph dictionary .was printed, each character being
accompanied by its appropriate telegraph sign. In
writing out messages at first this substitute was
employed and the receiver was obliged to consult
his dictionary before he could translate it. Now,
however, the messages are written out in native
characters as in other countries.

Many difﬁculties, some of a peculiar nature, had

to be overcome in putting up the lines. For in-

stance, it was found in Finland that after the poles
were erected many of them were regularly dug up.
This was done repeatedly, and it was a long time
before the explanation was learned. Then it was
ascertained that the mischief was done by bears,
who mistook the humming made by the wind blow-
ing against the wires, for the noise of bees. They
dug up the poles in the effort to get at the honey
which they believed to be near. By piling stones
at the base of the poles, the trouble was remedied.

In Persia when the camel driver passed under
the lines, he noticed that the insulators were just
at the right height for him to reach with his stick.
Being like other persons, he could not resist the
temptation to reach up and and strike them a blow

8 Epoc/zs 2'72 Amerzkan Ifzktory.

It survived the sufferings and perils to which
all were exposed, and before which all, down to
that time, succumbed.

Because of the discovery of the North American
continent in 1497, by the Cabots, England claimed

the whole of this country. That nation saw her .

grand opportunities in the New World, and, after
a time, she made strong efforts to plant colonies on
our soil. Her ﬁrst attempts, like those of other
nations, failed, but she met with success at the
beginning of the seventeenth century.

James I. became King of England in 1603.
Three years later he granted letters patent, as
they were called, to a number of persons, which
gave them the exclusive right to all lands on the
Atlantic coast between latitude 34° and 45° north,
and all the islands lying within one hundred miles.
This royal document compelled the gentlemen to
form two companies, the Northern and Southern.
The directors of the northern colony lived in Ply-
mouth, and they, therefore, took the name of the
Plymouth Company, while because the directors of
the other lived in London, their company bore that
name. .
The territory of the Plymouth Company ex-
tended from Halifax, in Nova Scotia, to the latitude
of Delaware Bay, while that of London reached
from Cape Fear to the eastern end of Long Island.

134 Epoc/es 2'72 Ameriam Hzkioij/.

that shivered the glass. This sport was stopped
by surrounding the insulators with iron.

In South Africa, the natives persisted in stealing
the wire to make bracelets, nose rings and other
ornaments. The workmen checked them by tak-
ing along a lot of cheap gaudy wire with which the
thieves were bought off.

The ﬁrst submarine cable was laid in 1850, be-
tween Dover, England, and Calais, France, and is

still in operation. The ﬁrst successful cable across

the Atlantic was completed August 26, 1866. Since
then others have been laid, so that communication
with Europe is as easy as between two near points
in this country.

Before the first cable was laid under the sea, the
projectors were happy over the fact that no known
insect would eat India rubber. Nothing, therefore,
as they thought was to be feared from that source.
A scientist, however, told these people that they
were congratulating themselves too soon, and that,
while it might be true that no species of animal life
had as yet shown a fondness for rubber, yet there
were plenty of insects at the bottom of the Atlantic
that were beginning to feel a yearning for that kind
of food and would soon develop a fondness for it.
Sure enough, when the broken cable of 1858, was
brought up it was honeycombed by the tiny crea-
tures that had been feasting upon it.

Epoc/zs 2'72 Anmericavz Hzklory. 135

The submarine cables are exposed to many pecu-
liar dangers. The bottom of the ocean is broken
by plains, gullies, mountain peaks and chasms of
vast depth. Thus it often happens that the wire
is suspended from one elevated ridge to another,
with perhaps a half mile or n1ore of deep valley far
below the thin thread which spans it. The move-
ment of the currents cause the wire to swing slowly
back and forth until it is worn in two by abrasion.
Then an anchor may catch iii the line and destroy
it. Sometimes a monstrous whale observing the
wire stretching across two elevated portions, swims
beneath and tries to scrape off the barnacles from
his back by rubbing against it. The result is

generally that there is a break in international

communication for the time. In one instance, a
shark bit the wire squarely in two, though he lost
one of his teeth by his rapacity.

The growth of the telegraph system of the world
has been rapid and systematic, and ere long it will
be so complete that all parts of the world, will be in
touch, and every incident worth knowing that may
happen iii the remotest corner will be told with the
fullest particulars in the daily paper printed a few
hours later.

ways in 1830, but thirty years later, the country
had 31,000 miles of them, built at a cost of more
than a billion dollars. Our agricultural products

surpassed that of any other country, and our

Epoc/zs 2'72 Amerzkan Hzktory. 137

merchant vessels were exceeded only by those of
Great Britain. The number of States had become
thirty-three. It was found that the deposits of
coal equaled that of all the rest of the world.
Gold, ﬁrst discovered in California in 1848, was
found to exist in other sections, while the value of
silver and other minerals was beyond calculation.
There were more than one hundred thousand
public schools in the Various States, besides an
immense number of private schools and nearly
four hundred colleges. The children and young
men and women in attendance at these institutions
exceeded ﬁve hundred thousand.

It would seem that our country should have
been happy under all these favoring conditions;
but when, in 1619, a Dutch vessel landed twenty
negro slaves at Jamestown, it sowed the baleful
seeds, whose accursed harvest had been steadily
growing for more than two centuries until now it
was fully ripe.

Slavery was the cause of the most terrible war
of modern times. It draped this land in mourning
and bathed it with the blood of brothers until the
soil was crimson and the heavens covered as with
a pall of death itself. In the early days slavery
was lawful in all the colonies, but the climate and
conditions in the north were unfavorable, and it
gradually disappeared until it was wholly conﬁned

138 Epoc/zs 2'72 Ameriam, Hzktory.

to the southern States. The invention of the
cotton-gin, as already described, made slave labor
very proﬁtable in the South which became strongly
attached to the institution.

A sentiment grew in the North of bitter op-
position to slavery. The majority of the people
there were willing to leave the institution alone
in the slave States, but were opposed to its exten-
sion into the new Territories that might be ac-
quired. The ﬁerce quarrels in Congress were
soothed for the time in 1820, by the,adoption of the
Missouri Compromise. This was an agreement
by which all other territory which might be ac-
quired should be free, if it lay north of the south-
ern boundary of Missouri.

The quarrel was renewed in 1854, when this
compromise was repealed and Congress decided
that the question of slavery should be deter-
mined by the people of the new Territories them-
selves. This angered the ‘North, and the people
were still more incensed three years later, when
the Supreme Court of the United States rendered
the Dred Scott decision, as it was called, which
declared that a slaveholder had the right to take
his slaves into any State he chose without losing
ownership in them. The Fugitive Slave Law re-
quired that escaping slaves, when they reached the
free States, should be surrendered to their owners.

Epoc/zs 2'72 Ameriaziz ]{z's2‘07/y. 139

The law was openly resisted and blood often shed.
All thoughtful people saw that the dispute could
never be settled except by going to war, for the
chasm between the sections grew wider every day.

In the autumn of 1860, Abraham Lincoln was
elected President. He was the candidate of the
Republican party, which declared itself opposed to
the extension of slavery into the Territories, but
was satisﬁed not to disturb it in the States where
it already existed.

The South saw in the election of Lincoln so
serious a peril to slavery, and to what they believ-
ed to be their rights, that they determined to
secede from the Union. South Carolina took the
lead. Without waiting for the others, she called
a convention in Charleston, which passed an

“ordinance of secession” December 20, 1860.~

She declared her union with the other States at an
end and herself an independent nation. She even
sent agents to treat with President Buchanan, as
if he represented a foreign government, but the
president refused to receive them.

South Carolina was not left alone by her sister
States in the South. Mississippi, _Alabama,
Florida, Georgia and Louisiana seceded in Jan-
uary, 186l; Texas in February and Virginia,
North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas later.

Since South Carolina was the first to secede.

140 E1506/zs 2'72 Amerzkan Hzktory.

she knew she would be the first to receive the
blow that the North would strike for the Union.
She began her preparations and was so deﬁant
that she seemed eager to measure strength with
the national government. Meanwhile, the dele-
gates from the seceded States met at Mont-
gomery, Alabama, in February, 1861, and formed
a government for the Confederate States of
America. Jefferson Davis of Mississippi was
chosen President and Alexander Stephens of
Georgia, Vice-President.

‘Charleston harbor was defended by Castle
Pinckney and Forts Moultrie, Sumter, and
Johnson. Major Robert Anderson commanded
the United States troops in the harbor. He was
stationed in Fort Moultrie, but since Fort Sumter
was much the strongest fort, he decided to re-
move the garrison thither, for he knew from the
active preparations of the secessionists that he
would soon be attacked.

'On the night of December 26th, when the full
moon was shining from a cleariisky, Anderson with
his garrison passed over from Moultrie to Sumter,
spiking the guns which he left behind, cutting
down the ﬂagstaff and destroying the gun car-
riages. The disunion forces did not suspect what
he was doing until after the transfer was made.
They immediately occupied Fort Moultrie and

Epocks 2'72 Americam Hzktory. 141

Castle Pinckney and began erecting fortiﬁcations
from which to ﬁre upon Fort Sumter.

Thus matters remained for several months
during which the entire country was seething
with excitement. The Confederate government
sent General P. G. T. Beauregard to Charleston
to take command of the forces there. Beaure-
gard summoned Anderson to surrender,_ but the
demand was refused, Anderson expressing the
belief, however, that unless provisions soon
reached him he would be starved out. Beaure-
gard sent another message to the effect that if
Anderson would set a time when he would
vacate the fort and promise in the meantime
not to use his guns against the Confederates, unless
he was attacked, ﬁre would not be opened upon him.
Anderson named the 15th as the day on which he
would evacuate the fort, unless he received provi-
sions and other instructions from his government.

This answer did not suit Beauregard, for he
knew that a Union ﬂeet with supplies and re-
inforcements was lying off the harbor at that
time. Accordingly, Beauregard notiﬁed Anderson’
that he would open ﬁre upon him.

The ﬁrst shot was ﬁred at half past four o’clock
on the morning of April 12th, from Cummings Point
battery. The Confederate batteries were at Fort
Moultrie and Cummings Point, distant slightly

less and slightly more than a mile. In addi-
tion, there were two mortar batteries on Morris
Island. Nineteen batteries in all began ﬁring
upon Fort Sumter before she replied.

Major Anderson had only seventy-nine regular
soldiers and thirty laborers. There were no
screws, tangents or scales for his guns and he was
obliged to make temporary shears. He allowed
his men to eat breakfast and then returned the
ﬁre. At noon his cartridges gave out and
blankets, linen, and other material were used
as substitutes. Two of his guns on the open

It must not be thought that the bombard-
ment was rapid, or that the shots sent at Fort
Sumter followed one another in rapid succession.

Epoc/zs 2'72 Ameriam Hzktory. 143

The shells were ﬁred at the rate of one every
twenty minutes or three each hour. Anderson
replied slowly and thus the ﬁring con-
tinued until darkness, when the fort stopped,
although the Confederates kept it up through
the night.

At seven o’clock the next morning, Anderson
resumed ﬁring, but without inﬂicting any
damage. From the fort, the Union ﬂeet could
be seen lying outside the harbor but it could
not approach near enough to give help.
Anderson was left alone to ﬁght it out as
best he could.

By and by the shells of the Confederates set
ﬁre to the oﬁicers’ barracks. The ﬁre was ex-
tinguished, but broke out several times. The
result of this was to ﬁll the interior of the fort
with dense suffocating smoke. The only way
for the garrison to save themselves from strang-
ling was by lying ﬂat on their faces and catch-
ing the partially clear air under the thick
vapor. There was imminent danger, too, of an
explosion of the magazine and ninety barrels of
powder were emptied into the sea. The condition of
the garrison became so distressing, that the flag was
run up with the Union down, as a signal of distress.

Seeing the call for help through the smoke,
Beauregard ceased ﬁring and sent a boat to

Epoc/zs 2'72 Americcm Hzktory. 9

It was further arranged that all colonies planted
by these two companies should be governed by a
council in England, the members of which were to
be named by the king.

In the month of December, 1606, the London, or
southern colony, sent three vessels across the At-
lantic. On these vessels were one hundred and
ﬁve men, but no women. Many of the men were
idle adventurers, who thought they would ﬁnd
plenty of gold in the New World, and become rich
without having to work as they did at home.
Only a few of the immigrants were.the right kind

of people to form a thriving settlement. The ships l

were under the command of Captain Christopher
Newport.

The weather was so cold and stormy that several
weeks passed before the vessels dared to leave the
coast of «England and head across the ocean. Then
they took a roundabout course by the West Indies,
so that the spring of 1607 had come before they
sighted the American coast. They sailed slowly
northward, looking for a good place to land, and
entered the mouth of the Chesapeake. To a cape
on the south they gave the name of Henry, and to
another on the north that of Charles. This was in
honor of two sons of King James, ‘

feeling that it was useless to resist longer, ran
up the white ﬂag in token of surrender. ‘
The bombardment had lasted thirty-four hours,

Eﬁoc/zs in Amevriam f]z'sz‘07j/. 145

during which the fort was knocked into ruins.
No person was killed on either side. The
members of the garrison were allowed to take
their property with them and to salute the ﬂag.
In ﬁring the salute one of the company was
killed. Of the Confederates three were slightly
wounded.

Major Anderson and his men took their ﬂag
with them, went on board a Confederate vessel
and were transferred to the Balzfic of the relief
squadron. They reached New York on the 18th,
and were received with the salutes of the forts
and the cheers of the people who were gathered
in thousands to give them welcome. Major
Anderson was presented with the freedom of the
city, with swords and medals and commissioned
a brigadier-general by President Lincoln. His
health, however, was not rugged, and he did little
service during the war.

The bombardment of Fort Sumter is generally
considered as the opening of the war for the
Union. There had been shots ﬁred, and num-
erous affrays sometimes amounting to skirmishes,
in other places, but this was the ﬁrst direct ex-
change of shots between the United States and
the forces that had revolted against it.

Those of us who remember those days can
never forget them. From the moment Beaure-

146 Epoc/zs 2'72 Amev/z'cmz Hzklory.

gard opened his ﬁI'Sl'. gun the telegraph wires,
north and south, trembled with the news. In
the north the feeling was of anger and exasper-
ation.

When the news came that Anderson had sur-
rendered, grief and rage were the controling emo-
tions. Any one who expressed sympathy for the
secessionists was mobbed and the demand was gen-
eral that President Lincoln should give all a
chance to punish the men that had committed the
outrage.

The excitement in the South was just as intense,
but there the feeling was of rejoicing and confi-
dence. The bells in Charleston pealed, men em-
braced on the streets and Governor Pickens
from the balcony of the Charleston Hotel thank-
ed God that the war had begun and pledged
himself and the rest of the South Carolinians
that they would die before they would surrender.
On Sunday, the 14th, thanksgiving services
were held in all the churches.’

It was much the same throughout the South.
There had been plenty of Union men, and, in
some places, the States had seceded only after
a prolonged struggle and indeed in the face of
the strongest opposition. But almost all the
Union sentiment was swept away in the whirl-
wind or buried out of sight. Some of those

Epoc/zs in Amerzkan Hzktory. 147

that had been the most determined against
secession were now the most clamorous for it.

Military companies had been forming and
drilling for months, and they insisted that they
might be given a chance to drive the northern
invaders from their sacred soil. It may be
said that the Union sentiment in the North
and the disunion sentiment in the South now
crystalized.

President Lincoln issued his call for volun-
teers, ﬁve times the number he asked for a11-
swered. It was the same in the South, and in
a short time the most terrible war of modern
times was at its height.

the Confederates that he decided to destroy the
United States property, to prevent its falling into
their hands. Because of the haste with Which the
work was done, a good deal was not ﬁnished.
The vessels were ﬁred on the 21st of April, 1861,
among them being the 40-gun frigate Merrzmac,
of three thousand ﬁve hundred tons. She burned
to the waters edge but sank before much damage
was done -to her hull. ‘

Epocks 2'72 Americmz Hzklory. 149

She was raised on the 30th of May, when her
hull and engines were found to be unharmed.
She was placed in the dry dock, and the captors
began encasing her in metal, backed by wood of
great thickness. A cast iron ram was attached to
her prow, being about two feet under water, and
the craft was pierced for ten guns. She was re-
named the W'rgz'7zz'a by the Confederates, but will
always be remembered by her old name.

' Work was pushed on this strange vessel night
and day, month after month, but she was not
completed until March, 1862, when she was placed
under the command of Captain Franklin
Buchanan, a former ofﬁcer of the‘ United States
navy, who had under him a crew of three hun-
dred and twenty men.

On the forenoon of March 8th, the Merrzbazac
swung from her moorings at Norfolk, and steam-
ed slowly down the Elizabeth River. Her
enormous size and weight enabled her to move
about as fast as a man can walk, while she drew
twenty-two feet of water. Two small steamers
and a tug accompanied the Merrzkvzac, who was on
her way to destroy the Union ﬂeet in Hampton
Roads.

It was a lovely spring morning, with a gentle‘

breeze rippling the broad waters of the bay, and
the beautiful National ships riding easily at their

150 Epoc/zs 2'72 Amerz'c(m Hzktory.

anchors. There was no thought of danger, when
the men on the Union vessels observed the black
smoke of two steamers over the trees that shut the
Elizabeth river from view. By and by, a third
black line following the course of the river,
showed that another steamer was approaching.
Then all three were seen coming down the river
toward Sewall’s Point. After a time, an object
resembling the roof of an immense barn, belching
black smoke from her chimney, was noticed com-
ing toward the Union ﬂeet. At about one o’clock,
the ./llerrzhmzc emerged from the river, and was in
full view of all the ships whose decks were
crowded with spectators watching the strange
sight.

It was known to the National government, that
the Confederates had been at work for a long time
on this massive iron-clad. The authorities were
kept daily informed of their progress, but the
rumors about her had been so frequent that a good
many came to believe there was little cause for
fear, but here she was at last and the question was
to be decided.

The men-of-war immediately prepared for action,
and, before the Merrzmac was within range, they
were waiting for her. She gradually approached,
with her ports closed and her escorts well to the
rear. Then the Czmzberlcma’ blazed away with

Epoc/zs in /1merz°ca7z Hzktory. .151

her heavy port guns, quickly followed by those of
the Congress and the batteries on shore; but, for
the ﬁrst time in history, the prodigious broadsides
did no harm. The tons of metal struck the slop-
ing armor of the Merrzhzac and skipped upwards
for hundreds of feet, splashing back into the
water while this new monster paid no more heed
to the hammering than if so many peas were
tossed against its iron side.

Finally, when within easy range, the Mer7‘z)7zac
ﬁredone gun which hulled the Czmzber[a7za”s
quarter and wounded or killed nearly all the crew
of the after pivot gun. Both the Congress and
Czmzberlmzd delivered their full broadsides at the
monster, barely a hundred yards distant, but the
Merrzmac shook them off, as an elephant twitches
off the ﬂies that alight on his hide. The Merrzl
macﬁred again, killing and slaying men by the
score. Then crowding on all steam she
headed for the helpless Cumberland. The
iron snout was jammed into the side of the
frigate, opening a rent through which a team of
horses could have been driven, heeling over the
vessel and causing her to quiver from stem to
stern.

As the Merrzmac backed away, she left her ram
sticking in the side of the mangled ship. Lieu-
tenant Jones, a former class mate of Lieutenant

152 Epoe/zs z'n A7nerz'azn Hzktory.

Morris at the Navel Academy, called through a
port hole:

“Surrender, Morris, or I’ll sink you!”

“Never,” called back Morris; “I will sink
alongside!”

For nearly an hour, the Merrznzae and her con-
sorts concentrated their ﬁre on the doomed Cum-
berland. The destruction of life was awful, but
the red ﬂag was run up, meaning “No surrender,”
and though the frigate was sinking, the American
sailors kept up the unequal ﬁght, if such it may
be called, until ﬁnally, when the Cnnzéerlana’ was
going down, those who were not killed or helpless
leaped into the water. Her masthead remained a
few feet above the surface, as she settled at the
bottom of the bay, with the ensigns still ﬂuttering
in the gentle breeze. Of the crew of three hun-
dred and seventy-six, one hundred and twenty
were killed or drowned.

Having completed the destruction of the Cum-
berland, the /I/err2'n2cze now gave her attention to

‘the Congress. At less than two hundred yards

distant, she raked the frigate with her entire
broadsides, inﬂicting death and wounds almost
without number, and tearing the vessel with
terrible effect. The crew fought with the heroism
of their comrades on the Czmzberlana’, until the

blood ran out of the scuppers and splashed into the

Epoc/zs in Americcm Hzstory. 153

water. Lieutenant Wood was killed, and his
successor, Lieutenant Pendergrast, resisted for an
hour, when, seeing that not a shred of hope re-
mained, he displayed the white ﬂag. Two Con-
federate gunboats ran alongside to ‘take off the
prisoners, but the shore batteries kept up so hot a
fire, that they hauled off with only thirty prison-
ers. The remainder of the crew leaped into the
water and swam ashore, while the enemy opened
with hot shot upon the Congress, which soon broke
into ﬂames. She burned the rest of the afternoon
and far into the night. The Congress had a crew
of four hundred and thirty-four men, of whom
one hundred and thirty were killed or drowned,
including her commander and a large number of
wounded, besides the thirty that were taken
prisoners. The Merrzkizac had two killed and
eight wounded, among the latter being Captain
Buchanan.

After inﬂicting serious injuries upon several
other vessels, the ./I/e7*rz'mac and her consorts with-
drew in the gathering darkness to Norfolk, intend-
ing to return on the morrow and complete her
work of destruction.

ed through the north and caused profound gloom.

waited to the settlers by the gentle breeze blowing
across the calm water. They saw many Indians,
too, peeping at them from among the trees and
vegetation, just as the natives on San Salvador
watched the caravels of Columbus more than a
hundred years before.

The scene could not have been more pleasing,
and the three vessels turned into the mouth of a
broad river, to which they gave the name of James,
in compliment to their king. After sailing up
stream for about forty miles, they saw a spot which
seemed the one they wanted. It was on a penin-
sula, and, dropping their anchors, the immigrants
went ashore and began a settlement, which was
named Jamestown, also in honor of their king,
whom the settlers seemed anxious to compliment
and to please.

This landing was made on the 13th of May,
1607, and Jamestown was the first permanent
English settlement planted in America. Edward
Maria Wingﬁeld was chosen president of the
council or ruling body, all of whose laws had to
suit the council in England, before the settlers
could be compelled to obey them. '

One 01 the members of the Jamestown council

wonderful adventures in different parts of the Old
World. He loved to brag about them, and it is to

believed that the fearful iron-clad would sail up
the Potomac, destroy Washington, and then visit-
ing Philadelphia and New York, lay them under
tribute, with the result that nothing could save
the Union. The prospects was dark indeed, but

should die.

mac. John Ericsson, the famous Swedish invent-
or, then an old man, began the construction of
another iron-clad, one-ﬁfth the size of the
MeVrz'772ac, which he named the 1110722107. The
keel was laid at the Continental Iron Works,
Greenpoint, Long Island, October 25th, 1861,
and she was completed and launched in one
hundred days. She made her trial trip on the
19th of February, and was turned over to the
government on the 4th of the following month,
just four days before the disastrous work of the
Merrz'nzac, in Hampton ‘Roads. Lieutenant John
L. Worden left a sick bed and volunteered to
take command of the crew, which numbered
about forty. She mounted two eleven inch guns,
each of which ﬁred a solid shot weighing one
hundred and eighty pounds. Her appearance has
been aptly compared to that of a cheese box
on a raft.

Epoic/zs in American I-[z'sz‘07/y. 155

At eleven o’clock on the morning of March
6th, the Monzkor left New York and, towed by
a tug boat, ventured out upon the stormy
Atlantic. Being a new craft, there were many
defects in her construction, and more than once
she was in imminent danger of foundering. Some
of the men were overcame by gas, the machin-
ery refused at times to work, and the crew had
to resort to bailing to keep aﬂoat. Had_ there
been continued rough water, the /110722207 would
have gone down before she was half way to
Hampton Roads, but she survived and at four
o’clock on the afternoon of the 8th, _while pass-
ing Cape Henry, she heard the faint booming
of the guns of the My/'rz'772ac as she pounded
the Congress to death. Lieutenant Worden made
every effort to reach the scene of the battle, but
did not arrive at Fortress Monroe until nine

. o’clock in the evening. He steamed up the

channel, and about midnight anchored alongside
the Mzhnesota, which was aground. The whole
night was spent by the tired crew in making
preparations for the battle of the morrow.

The following day was Sunday, as calm and
restful as the day before. At an early hour the
dark outlines of the Merrz'nzac were distinguish-
ed approaching to resume her grim work of
destruction. She was now under the command

The leviathan was conﬁdent, while the thousands
who were watching the impeding conﬂict, hoped

The Merrzmac opened with her bow gun, but
missed by a wide space. She had now only a

small mark to ﬁre at, instead of the side of a.

frigate, as on the day before. Lieutenant Worden
waited until quite close, when he sent a single
solid shot, the Merrzwzac ﬁring a broadside al-
most at the same moment. Since this was the
ﬁrst test, the officers and crew of the M0nz't0r
anxiously scanned the result. They heard the
vicious impact of the huge shells, and, witha
relief beyond description, observed that none
had penetrated the armor of the M0nz't0V, nor
inflicted injury, while what was equally im-
portant, the revolving turret of the smaller craft
moved easily.

Passing each other the iron-clads turned and
ﬁred again. It was a strange sight, this tempest
of shot and shell hurled back and forth with a
power that would have shattered into kindling
wood, the largest frigate aﬂoat, and yet the
enormous shot launched with inconceivable force,
glanced off from each iron hide, like pebbles
skipping over the surface of aumill pond.

The lightness of the Monzkor gave her one
great advantage. She could turn and maneuver
much more quickly than her massive antagonist,
and her revolving turret brought her guns in
range when they were ready to be ﬁred. Finding

158 Epocﬁs in ’/Imerz'ccm Hzktory.

the interchange of shot did no damage,
Lieutenant Worden made a dash at the rudder
or propeller at the stern of the ./1/277/z'772ac, hop-
ing thus to disable her. He missed the mark
by barely three feet. At the moment of passiiig,
both guns were ﬁred and partially crushed the
casemate of the ./l/er7*z'mac. The shock was so
great that the crew of the after- guns were
knocked down a11d many bled at the nose
a11d ears.

Finally the ./W677/z'77zac decided to use her ram,
but as sl1e drew near, the /V[07zz'lor turned so
that the blow glanced off and did no harm.
Even when struck, the smaller craft was merely
pushed along. As one of the ofﬁcers of the
Me7'rz)7zac said, the utmost they “could accomplish,
when trying to ram, was merely to push the
M0nz't0r, as a board is shoved in front of the
cutwater of a barge. Then, in desperation, the
Merrzhazac determined to board, but the /I/0722207”
moved into shallow water, where she could not
be followed.

For two hours this extraordinary battle con-
tinued, when Lieutenant Worden hauled off to
replenish his ammunition, it being necessary to
hoist the huge balls from the hold into the
turret. The ./I/£7/rz'77zac accepted this temporary
withdrawal as evidence that the ./110722207 was

Epocks 2'72 Amerz'ca7z Hzkiory. 159

retreating, but ﬁfteen minutes later the little
craft headed toward the Merrz'mac again, and
the latter now concentrated her ﬁre on the pilot
house Shortly after a shell exploded hardly a

foot from where Worden was watching the

enemy, through a sight-hole, and ﬁlled his face
and eyes with powder. He was so blinded and
helpless that the command devolved upon Lieu-
tenant Greene, who, hurrying to the pilot house,
gave his attention to the foe, while Lieutenant
Worden was left in care of the surgeon.

Lieutenant Jones of the /I/e7/7z'7mzc, ﬁnding he
could not follow the Moizzlor into shallow water,
turned about and headed for Norfolk. The
Mo7zz'l0r sent several shot after him as if chal-
lenging him to come back and ﬁnish the ﬁght,
but the Merrzkvzac steamed up the Elizabeth
river, while the Z!/0122207 returned to her station
alongside the [I/z'mzesoz‘a.

In this ﬁrst battle between iron-clads, the
/I/om'z‘0r received nine shots on her turret, two
on the pilot house, three on her deck and
eight on her side. She ﬁred forty-one shot,
most of which struck the /I/e7'rz'77zac and caused
twenty indentations.

In some respects this was the most remarkable
naval battle ever fought, since it was the ﬁrst one
between iron-clads. It lasted for hours, during

160 Epoc/zs 2'72 A77zerz'ca7¢ Hzktory.

which the heaviest shot and shell were ﬁred at
short range and no man was killed on either side.
It proved that the days of wooden frigates were
numbered, and brought a revolution in naval

warfare. To-day the navies of all the great

nations of the world are made up of armored
vessels.

The fate of the two vessels which wrought this
great change was tragic. In May following,
Norfolk was abandoned by the Confederates. To
prevent the Merrzwzac falling into the hands of the
Union forces, she was set on ﬁre on the 10th of
May and blew up the day following. December
29th, the ./110722107, Commander john P. Bankhead,
sailed for Beaufort, N. C., accompanied by the
steamer R/zode Island. A short distance south of
Cape Hatteras, the vessels ran into a heavy gale,
and at about midnight, on the 30th, the ./I/omltor

- sank, carying with her sixteen men out of her

complement of sixty-ﬁve.

G ETTYSBURG.

, --‘=‘5~*i HE War for the Union,
' ushered in by the
bombardment of Fort
Sumter, was fought
with the utmost ardor by the
armies of the North and South.
At ﬁrst, the ﬁghting was
without any well deﬁned plan,
and the advantage was with
the Confederates. They were
warring on inner lines, and
united in their resistance to
the invasion of the Union
., forces that were seeking to
bring them back to their al-

   

Each section underestimated
the strength and determination of the other. Many
leaders in the North believed the South would be
conquered within ninety days. At the ﬁrst great
battle, fought at Manassas or Bull Run, July 21,
1861, General Scott, who commanded all the Union
armies in the ﬁeld, did not dream of the possibility

162 Epoc/zs 2'72 Americcm Hzklory.

of defeat. The North was thrown into consterna-
tion by the rout of the Union army which retreated
into the defences of Washington.

This Confederate victory was the worst thing
possible for the hopes of the South and a fortunate
event to the North. It gave the former undue
conﬁdence. The people were so certain of triumph
that many soldiers went home, believing the war
was over. On the contrary, the North was roused
to greater exertions. The National government,
for the ﬁrst time, comprehended the gigantic task
before it and it set to work to accomplish that task.
Men were enlisted for three years, incompetent offi-
cers were w_eeded out, the armies greatly increased,
the navy made tenfold stronger and a deﬁnite plan
of campaign agreed upon.

To conquer the South, it was necessary to do
three things: ﬁrst, to blockade; this would pre-
vent the sailing of Confederate Vessels with cotton
a11d the bringing back of needed supplies; second,
the North must get control of the "Mississippi, as
the Confederacy obtained thousands of cattle for
its armies from beyond; it must be opened and the
Confederates driven away from the shores; and,
third, the powerful armies in the ﬁeld must be
conquered.

This was the colossal work to which the Union
armies addressed themselves. The blockade was

Epochs in Aﬂzerzkaiz I-[zk/079/. 163

made so effective that great distress was caused in
the Confederacy, and, after the most determined
efforts, the Mississippi was opened throughout its
entire length, in the summer of 1863. That which

remained to be done was the most difﬁcult of all———

the destruction of the principal Confederate army,
commanded by General Robert E. Lee. He was
an officer of great skill, and handled ‘by him, the
Army of Northern Virginia, as it was called, had
beaten back all the attempts of the Army of the
Potomac to capture Richmond. It was American
against American and the oﬂicers and soldiers on
both sides were the best in the world.

The Confederate army felt itself so strong that it
marched northward into Maryland in the autumn
of 1862. It gained no substantial success, and
received a serious check at Antietam. The ﬁght-
ing remained indecisive until nearly a year later,
when once more General Lee turned his face north-
ward and advanced into Pennsylvania.

Lee had now the finest army that had ever been
gathered under his command. It consisted of
seventy thousand veterans, under skillful ofﬁcers,
well armed and buoyant with the belief that noth-
ing could prevent their capturing Baltimore,
VVashington and Philadelphia and dictating terms

of peace to the North. Lee marched rapidly down.

be feared that some of the stories he told had more
fiction than truth in them. All the same, how-
ever, he was brave, sturdy and not afraid to work.
His name was John Smith, and, but for him, the
Jamestown colony, like so many others, would have
met with failure. The remaining members of the
council did not like him, but before long, they found
that he was the only man who knew how to rule a
colony and save it from ruin. So he was made
president and it was fortunate that this was done.

The climate was so hot and the air from the
swamps so poisonous, that many of the colonists
became ill. Numbers died, and most of those that
were left lost courage and were anxious to go back
to England. They showed no desire to work; but
Smith told them that no well man should have a
mouthful of food unless he did his share of the
labor necessary in building cabins, a fort and in till-
ing the ground. He set the example himself, and,
since every one knew he would do just what he
said, they began to work and matters improved.

In those days and for a long time after, every
one who came to this country thought the conti-
nent was only a few hundred miles wide, so that
a person would not have to go far up any of the big
rivers before he would reach the South Sea, as the
Paciﬁc Ocean was generally called. The
London council required of the colonists to make

on to Chambersburg, with the Union army follow-
ing along the east side of the Blue Ridge and South
Mountains. General Grorge G. Meade was in com-
mand of the Union forces and, fearful that he would
get in his rear and cut off his communications with
Richmond, Lee tur11ed eastward toward Baltimore,
with the view of compelling Meade to defend it.

On the 30th of June, Meade was within a few
miles of the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
One of the Confederate divisions had a brisk en-
gagement with a corps under Reynolds on the west
side of the town, during which General Reynolds
was killed. The Eleventh Union Corps, under
the command of General Howard, arrived early in
the afternoon. It was composed mainly of Germans,
who broke and ﬂed through Gettysburg, pursued
by the Confederates. General Hancock arriving
soon after, took command and the shattered corps
was formed anew on Culp’s Hill at the rear of the
town. Hancock sent word to Meade, ﬁfteen miles
away, to hurry forward with the army, since the
main battle must take place at Gettysburg. Meade
did as requested, some of his forces reaching the
town that night, some next morning, while Sedg-
wick’s corps arrived in the afternoon, after a march
of thirty-ﬁve miles.

Hancock’s line was formed along Cemetery Hill

and Lee deemed it so strong that he decided to"

E1506/25 2'7; Ame/rz'ca7z Hzktory. 165

make no attack until the arrival of all his forces.
The two greatest armies of the country were
steadily drawing near each other for the decisive
struggle of the war.

On the 1st of July, the Union army, consisting
of one hundred thousand men and two hundred
cannon, held a powerful position, with the right on
Culp’s Hill, and the center on Cemetery Hill, while
the left was posted along Cemetery Ridge. This

gave the line the form of a crescent, the projecting

portion being turned toward Gettysburg.

That night Lee occupied Gettysburg and the
country to the east and west. His left under Ewell
held the town; Seminary Ridge was occupied by
Hill, but Pickett’s division did not arrive until the
3d, when it took position on the right of Hill. The
cavalry under the command of General  E. B.
Stuart was absent on a raid, and having lost their
way, Lee was deprived of their invaluable services.

Nearly all of July 2d was spent by the two armies
in adjusting the troops for battle, which was opened
at ﬁve o’clock in the afternoon by Lee. It quickly
assumed a terriﬁc nature, in which the Confederates
made the most desperate efforts to break through
the Union line. They gained important successes,
but were unable to shatter the main line. Matters
were in an unsatisfactory shape for both sides, and
the ﬁnal struggle remained for the morrow.

166 Epoc/zs 2'72 A merican History.

Lee, after carefully studying the ﬁeld and arrang-
ing his men, decided to direct his efforts against the
Union centre, hoping to break apart the two wings.
The preparations were so important that they were
not completed until noon. By that time, Lee had
one hundred and forty-ﬁve cannon planted on
Seminary Ridge, opposite Meade’s centre, while
Meade on the crest of Cemetery Hill held eighty
cannon pointed toward the enemy.

At noon the two hundred and twenty-ﬁve pieces
of artillery opened and for two hours the mountains
shook under the most fearful cannonade ever heard
on the American continent. Then from Seminary
Ridge, a mile away, the Union troops saw through
the lifting masses of smoke, a long line of Confe-
derate gray, with their crimson battle ﬂags ﬂutter-
ing above them and their muskets agleam in the
sunlight, advance with the even step of parade.
They were Pickett’s division, the ﬂower of the
Confederate army, and they were charging against
the Union lines.

An impressive hush settled upon the vast battle
ﬁeld, and a murmur of admiration ran through the
Union legions grimly awaiting the attack. The
thousands of Confederates came on with the same
graceful, unvarying step, until half the space was
crossed, when the Union artillery opened ﬁre
against them. Scores were killed, but others ﬁlled

up the gaps and came on without wavering. Soon
they broke into the double quick, in the face of a
converging ﬁre that it seemed must kill every one.
Despite the repulse of the supports and the capture
of several thousand men, Pickett pushed on,
delivered a volley at the breastworks, and, dashing
up Cemetery Ridge, captured the works with the
bayonet.

But he had entered a volcano’s mouth. Thou-
sands of guns converged upon his men, and they
were assailed in front and ﬂank. With the rem-
nants of his command, Pickett retreated. One of
the most thrilling charges in all history had been
disastrously repulsed. -

General Lee, who was closely watching the
attempt, saw its overwhelming failure. He had
probably thirty thousand killed and as many
wounded during the continuous ﬁghting at Gettys-
burg, the loss on the Union side being not quite so
great.

The truth was forced upon the Confederate leader
that he had undertaken an impossible task. He
could not defeat the Union army, and it only re-
mained for him to retreat into Virginia, from which
he should never have come. The battle of Gettys-
burg had been fought and won by the Union forces.
On the same night of the defeat, Ewell’s corps was
withdrawn from the town and posted on Seminary

Epoc/zs 2'72 Amerzkan Hzktory. 169

Ridge. Fearing an attack from Meade, the Con-
federates intrenched themselves. The next day
was spent in burying their dead and in removing
the wounded. Then the dismal retreat was begun
at night by the Chambersburg and Fairﬁeld roads.
The disturbances of the atmosphere caused by a
great battle nearly always produce rains, and a cold
storm set in, which made the retreat of Lee of the
most depressing and gloomy nature. Meade pur-
sued, but Lee was watchful, and at no time was it
deemed safe for the Union army to attack him.
Reaching Hagerstown, Lee found the river so
swollen by rains that the fords were impassable.
The bridges had been carried away and he was
obliged to intrench himself and wait for the waters
to subside. When they did so, the river was forded
and once more the Army of Northern Virginia
stood on the soil of the Old Dominion.

As has been stated, the battle of Gettysburg was
the decisive battle in the War for the Union.
Never again did the Confederates come so near
success or penetrate so far into the North. They
fought bravely and well; they had done the utmost,
but they had failed.

It is true that the war did not end until nearly
two years later, and there were thousands in the
South who still believed they would gain their in-
dependence, but the leaders saw that there was no

170 Epocﬁs 2'12 Amerzkan Hzkiory.

ground for hope and the end Was inevitable. As
one of the greatest generals said, thenceforth they
were ﬁghting for terms, knowing full well that it
was “writ in the book of fate” that they must fail
and that the Union would be restored.

mington and Goldsboro being taken in rapid
succession.

About all that now remained to be conquered
was the dwindling army under General Lee, a
task which was assigned to General Grant, the
most successful of the Union leaders and who
remorsely pressed his opponent to the wall.

In February, 1865, Lee’s army numbered barely
thirty-ﬁve thousand men. General Longstreet
commanded the left wing, north and south of
the James; General Gordon the centre at
Petersburg and General A. P. Hill, the right,
extending from Petersburg to Hatcher’s Run.
The line was forty miles long, but necessarily
thin and weak.

Sherman was at Goldsboro, a hundred and
ﬁfty miles distant, n1arching northward across
Lee’s line of retreat and pushing General Jo
Johnston before him. When Sherman should
join Grant, the latter would have an army
numbering fully two hundred thousand. John-
ston was trying to unite with Lee, but Grant
took care that he did not succeed. In order to
prevent it, he arranged to attack Lee on the
29th of March, but a severe storm interfered.
Lee fought hard, but an attack by Sheridan
drove the Confederates in confusion toward
Petersburg.

Epoch: 2'72 Ameriam ffistory. 173

On the 1st of April, Grant opened with a
cannonade along the whole li11e and an assault
was ordered upon Petersburg the next morning,

' which was Sunday. The attack was made at

daylight, the ﬁring extending from the Appomattox
to Hatcher’s Run. Lee’s right wing had been
shattered a11d he had only the remnants of the
divisions of Gordon and A. P. Hill. Gordon re-
sisted as best he could, but was forced back into
his works. A. P. Hill’s position was still weak-
er, because of the withdrawal of his infantry the
day before, and the works were easily captured.
Petersburg was now almost entirely surrounded,

the only strong posts left in the hands of the ‘

Confederates being Forts Alexander and Gregg,
which commanded the ground over which the
Unionists must advance in order to reach the
river. Fort Alexander was near the Union line
a11d was taken in a twinkling.

But Gregg remained, and, if it could not be
held while Lee was taking a new position, his
army was lost. The garrison consisted of only
two hundred and ﬁfty men, who knew what
was at stake. With the promptness and per-
sistency which were notable characteristics of
Grant, he ordered an attack without delay. A
gallant charge was made, but when within ﬁfty
yards of the fort, a withering ﬁre repulsed the

explorations, and Smith spent many days and
weeks in cruising along the coasts of the Chesa-
peake in a small boat with a few men, and in ascend-
ing the streams which empty into that body of
water in his search for the South Sea. How as-
tonished he would have’ been had he known that
while in Chesapeake Bay he was as far from the
Paciﬁc Ocean as that bay was from England itself!

One day when Smith had gone up one of the
streams as far as he could in his boat, he turned
into shore and, leaving his companions, set out
alone to hunt, for, you need not be told, that the
woods abounded with game.

V/Vhile he was making his way through the
gloomy woods, he found himself suddenly attacked
by a large number of Indians. They whooped and
shouted and kept ﬁring their arrows at him, but
Smith had been into too many dangers to be scared
or to lose his presence of mind. His gun was of
the old pattern, called a match-lock. Such a
weapon is very clumsy and awkward as compared
with those now in use, but he brought it to his
shoulder, and, aiming carefully, killed one of the
foremost Indians. That frightened the others and
made them more cautious, but, they kept up the
attack, hiding behind trees and launching a good
many arrows at the plucky Englishman. 

Smith continued to walk slowly backward, with

174 Epocﬂs 2'72 Ame7rz'ccz7z Hzktory.

Union troops. Then followed a. second and third
charge which were also repelled. Not to be
denied, a fourth was made and it succeeded.
The Union soldiers overran the works and found
that out of the two hundred and ﬁfty composing
the garrison, more than two hundred were
either killed or wounded. But the heroic de-
fense had saved the Confederate army for the
time.

On that fateful Sunday, Jefferson Davis was
sitting in church in Richmond, when a mes-
senger entered and handed him a telegram
fron1 General Lee. The Confederate president
was informed that Lee’s outer li11es had been
forced and that Petersburg could be held only
a few hours longer. Its evacuation meant the
fall of Richmond and General Lee advised the
president to prepare for the worst.

The news quickly spread that the Union
troops would soon be in Richmond and a scene
of fearful excitement and panic followed. Davis,
the principal members of his cabinet and the
leading citizens hastily left the city by train for
Charlotte, North Carolina, but most of the
people could not get away. Law and order
were at an end. The government buildings and
storehouses were soon in ﬂames; saloons were
burst open and hundreds of people reeled through

Epoc/25 in American Hzklory. 175

the streets, which were lit up by the glare of
the conﬂagration that threatened to lay the whole
city in ashes. Shops were plundered, riots were
general, and the ground was continually shaken
by explosions. The next day the Union forces
occupied Richmond without opposition.

But Lee and his famishing army had not yet
laid down their arms. On Sunday the Con-
federate Chieftain found only one line of retreat
left open for him, and toward that the Union
army was steadily approaching. At midnight,
Lee began his withdrawal from his trenches.
Grant was prompt in pursuit, but by the time
his army was fairly on the march, Lee was
sixteen miles to the westward, although following
a longer line than his pursuer.

Lee crossed the Appomattox at Goode’s Bridge
and reached Amelia Court House, thirty-eight
miles west of Petersburg, on the 4th of April.
By that time, his ragged soldiers were on the
verge of starvation, but Lee had issued orders
some days before, knowing what his line of re-

'treat would be, for a train of supplies to be sent

him at Amelia Court House, but through a
mistake the whole train with its food kept on
to Richmond, where they were burned in the
conﬂagration that - evening in - the Confederate
capital.

176 Epoc/as in Amerz'az7z Hzklory.

When Lee found what had been done, he sei c
out detachments to hunt for food and forage, but
all came back empty handed. Meanwhile, Grant
was pressing his pursuit with prodigious vigor.
Lee headed toward F armville, thirty—ﬁve miles
distant, in the midst of a hilly country, while
the mountains beyond offered a safe retreat.
Knowing his purpose, the Union forces strained
every nerve to frustrate it.

Weak from the loss of sleep and food, many
of the Confederates staggered like drunken men.
They plucked and ate the bursting buds at the
roadside. Often after ﬁring a volley, the soldiers
dropped in the middle of the road and fell asleep.
Hundreds of the prisoners taken were slumber-
ing as soundly as if in their beds at home.
Ewell with his corps of forty-two hundred men
was surrounded and captured, including General
Curtis Lee and three other general ofﬁcers.

With the fragments of his army, Lee continued
his retreat, and on the 6th of April, crossed the
Appomattox at High Bridge, near Farmville, en-
camping on the western bank.

There Lee’s leaders met and discussed the
question of what could be done. The conclusion
was that one of three things remained to them:
to disband the army, after instructing the troops
to meet again at some safe point; to abandon

Epoc/zs in Avizerzban Hzktory. 177

the trains and with the infantry cut their way
through the Union lines, or surrender.

There were grave objections to the first plan.
The disbanded soldiers would prove a scourge
to the country and only a part of them would
rendezvous again, not enough to offer effectual
resistance. And since, too, the Union troops
outnumbered the Confederates ﬁve to one, it was
madness to think of cutting their way through
their lines. All, therefore, that was left was to
surrender. General Pendleton, chief of artillery,
was selected to make known the opinion of the
oﬂicers to General Lee. He listened and gravely
shook his head: he was not yet ready to admit
that all hope was gone. I

The Confederate army crossed the Appomattox
and set ﬁre to the bridge behind them, but
before it was destroyed the brigade having it in
charge was driven off and the bridge saved.
The wagon train was repeatedly attacked the
next day, and Lee intrenched himself a few
miles to the north of Farmville. Grant, having
occupied the town, sent a letter April 7th to
Lee, saying that the result of the last week
must have convinced him of the hopelessness of
further resistance; that the responsibility for the
additional eﬂusion of blood would rest upon Lee
who was asked to surrender his army.

178 Epocks in /171267/z'ca7z H21?/ory.

This letter reached Lee in the evening, and
he replied, that though he did not share the
opinion of Grant as to the uselessness of further
resistance, he asked the terms which he would
offer in the event of surrender.

Lee continued his retreat and was several miles
further away, when the next letter of Grant
reached him. The Union leader stated that
there was only one condition that he would
insist upon—name1y that the men and ofﬁcers
surrendered should be disqualiﬁed from taking
up“ arms against the government of the United
States until properly exchanged. General Grant
added that he would meet General Lee, or ap-
point ofﬁcers to meet any oﬁicers that he might
name, for the purpose of arranging deﬁnitely
the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia.

Lee now stated that he did not think the necessity
for surrender existed, but expressing a desire for
peace, proposed to meet Grant at ten o’clock the
following day on the old stage road to Richmond,
between the picket-lines of the two armies.

Grant was not pleased with Lee’s note and
he replied as follows:

“April 9, 1865.
“GENERAL:
“Your note of yesterday is received. I have no authority

to treat on the subject of peace; the meeting proposed for
ten A. M. to-day could lead to no good. Iwill state,

however, General, that I am equally anxious for peace with
yourself, and the whole North entertain the same feeling.
The terms upon which peace can be had are well under-
stood. By the South laying down their arms they will has-
ten that most desirable event, save thousands of human lives
and hundreds of millions of property not yet destroyed.
Seriously hoping that all our difficulties may be settled
without the loss of another life, I subscribe myself, etc.,
“U. S. GRANT,

‘ ‘Lz'em‘e7za7zz‘- General.
“GENERAL R. E. LEE.’_’

Fighting and ' retreating were continually
going on while this correspondence was pro-
gressing. It had been determined that Gordon
should cut his way through the Union lines
and he made the attempt, charging with his
usual valor, but before he could succeed he
found himself so hemmed in that his situation was
hopeless. At the moment that Sheridan was on
the point of giving the order for his cavalry to
charge, a horseman advanced from the Confederate
lines, bearing a white ﬂag.

The messenger brought a request from
General Lee that hostilities should be suspended
with a View to surrender. Lee also sent the
following letter to General Grant:

. “April 9, I865.

contained in your letter of yesterday for that purpose.

“Very Respectfully,

General Grant immediately replied:

took place at the house of Major Wilmer McLean,

Epoc/as 2'72 /1merz'ca7z Hzklory. 183

General Jo Johnston surrendered his army April
26, receiving the same terms, and by the close of the
following month all armed resistance to the Union
came to an end.

National like individual life is made up of
contrasts. When the tremendous civil war
came to a11 end and the Union was restored so
ﬁrmly that it shall last through all ages, there
were nearly a million men under arms. They
were veterans, too, hardened in the ﬂame of battle,
and the ﬁnest body of soldiers in the world.

During the month of May, the Army of the
Potomac and most of the veterans of Sherman
were marched to Washington, where on the 22nd and
23rd of that month was held the grandest review
ever seen in this country. In the presence of
the thousands who lined the streets and crowd-
ed windows, housetops and every place that
could give a view of the inspiring sight, that
magniﬁcent army marched past the President,
his Cabinet, the leading ofﬁcers and citizens and
the multitude of civilians, who cheered the
bronzed heroes to the echo. It was a stirring
scene which will never fade from the memory
of those that had the privilege of witnessing it.

La Rue County, Kentucky, and there, February

August, 1895, it was rebuilt from the old logs and
set up on the original site. One who remembers
it well says that it stood alone in a clearing, with
only one small room, a door, but no window, a

stick chimney, with open cracks through which
swept the winds, the rain, the snows of winter and
the swarms of mosquitoes in summer.

Abraham Lincoln’s boyhood was a hard one.
The schools were poor, and he did not often see the
inside of a schoolhouse, but he learned rapidly and
was soon able to read and Write. His father re-
moved to Knob Creek. ﬁfteen miles north—east, in

186 Epoc/zs 2'72 Ameriam Hzktory.

1813, and three years later emigrated to Indiana.
The new home was near Little Pigeon Creek, some
ﬁfteen miles north of the Ohio, and a mile and a
half east of Gentryville, Spencer County. The
cabin here, for a long time, had no window, door
or ﬂoor. It lacked even the old-fashioned deer-
skin, which in some houses served for a door; nor
was there any oiled pa_per to take the place of
window panes. Young Lincoln’s bed was a heap
of dry leaves in the corner of the loft, to which he
climbed by means of pegs driven into the wall.
The boy became sturdy and strong, and his help
was invaluable to the family. Like Franklin, he
was very fond of books, and when too poor to buy,
he borrowed from his neighbors. It was fortunate
that his scanty stock was of the best kind. It
included the Bible, H3sop’s Fables, Robinson
Crusoe, Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, a History
of the United States, Weem’s Life of Washing-
ton, and the Statutes of Indiana. Seated by
the log ﬁre, or stretched on his face, so that the
glare fell on the printed page, the guant, awkward-
looking boy would read by the hour, caring naught
for the wintry wind moaning through the open
chinks of the cabin; or the heat of the ﬁre, or the
smoke that made his eyes sting and smart.
Lincoln grew fast and had a homely face. Do
you remember how tall George Washington Was?

a time he locked arms with the men who thought
no one could throw them, but Lincoln would
tumble them on their backs with little trouble.

The people who knew Lincoln will never forget
his humor. He was fond of telling funny stories
and could keep a company laughing for hours at a
time. In his speeches, too, his humor delighted
his hearers. A great many of the stories which
he told were made up by himself, and for that
reason were always to the point and much better
than if some one else composed them.

When men become great they have usually
shown great qualities in their youth. They have
possessed that trait of never giving up which you
were told about in the account of Columbus and
Washington. No boy will ever amount to much
unless he “keeps at it,” and is willing to work,
work, work, until his task is ﬁnished.

It was this quality that enabled Abraham Lin-
coln to gain a good English education and to be-
come one of the foremost lawyers in the land.
He had another trait which it would be well if
every one imitated: he was honest. Nothing
would lead him to keep a cent which belonged
to another, or to take advantage of a person in a
trade. When he was clerk in a store, he would
sometimes find that he had not given a poor
Woman enough change. It might be only two or

Epochs 2'72 Amerzkan Hzktory. 189

three cents short; but, as soon as the store closed,
he would put on his hat and walk all the way to
the woman’s home, maybe miles away, and hand
the amount to her.

Being honest, he had to be truthful. He was
so noted for this that he came to be known by
every one as “Honest Abe.” It was a homely
name, perhaps, but what greater compliment could
he have been paid?

No man ever had a tenderer heart. It pained
him to see a person or animal suffer. Once when
riding on horseback with a company of lawyers
he was missed, because, as it was afterwards
learned, he had stopped his horse and spent a
long time in catching a young bird that had fallen
out of its nest and could not get back, while the
mother was ﬂying around in great distress. Lin-
coln caught the little thing and then climbed a
tree and put it back in its downy home.

“I couldn’t have slept to-night, if I hadn’t done
it,” he explained to his friends, as he rejoined
them.

He was not ashamed to work. When he was
given charge of a ﬂatboat to take to New Orleans,
no one wrought harder than he. While trying to
drive some hogs aboard, they became stubborn, or
I suppose were always so, and would not be driven.
So Lincoln picked them up in his arms, one after

t

190 Epoc/as 2'72 Ame'7*z'am [{z'5z‘07*y.

the other, and carried them kicking and squealing
on board.

A good many poor people are fond of moving,
and Lincoln’s father left Indiana and 111ade his
home in Illinois. The son helped to split rails for
the fences, and because of that was often called
the “ Rail Splitter.” Since his father was too poor
to pay his wages, the so11 hired out like a common
laborer, until he had earned enough to buy a suit
of cheap clothes.

Lincoln had many troubles. He went into the
grocery business with a partner and failed. He set
to work as hard as he knew how, and, by spending
little money for food and clothing, managed to
pay every cent of his debts. He was made post-
master, and showed his kind disposition by carry-T
ing around many of the letters and delivering them
to the persons to whom they were addressed.

By and by, his neighbors elected him a member
of the legislature. Lincoln put on the best suit
of clothes he could buy, which were of home-
spun and walked all the way to Springﬁeld to
attend the legislature. The distance was a
hundred miles. He had little to say or do in
that body, and when the session was over he
studied surveying. ‘ -

He had made up his mind, long before, to
become a lawyer and he now did so. The same

Epoc/zs 2'72 Amerzkcm Hzktovj/. 191

kindness and honesty which had marked his
life shone out still stronger in the profession
he had adopted. The suffering widow, and the
poor, ignorant colored man found him as ready
to serve them as he was to serve the wealthy
merchant who offered him a fee of a thousand
dollars. It made no difference if a client had
not a cent, Lincoln would not relax his efforts
for him.

A good rule of Lincoln was to urge persons
not to go to law, but to settle their quarrels
outside of the court room. A nobler rule of
conduct was never to take up a case when he knew
his client was in the wrong. He n1ade him tell
him everything, and if he saw his client was
unjust, he would say so and advise him to stop;
but if the man insisted upon going on, then
Lincoln would tell him he must hire some other
lawyer. He was true, honest, kind and manly
always.

Lincoln steadily grew in reputation. He was
elected to Congress in 1846. Some of the most
eloquent a11d brilliant Americans that ever lived
were then in that body, and he attracted little
attention. He was modest and quite con»-
tent to remain in the ‘background. But he was
attentive to his duties, and made himself master
of all the public questions that come before him.

It was not long before those who knew or
read about Lincoln saw his splendid qualities.
His wit, his power as a debater, his great ability,
his patriotism, sound sense and superb judg-
ment were admired by the whole country. It
was not strange, therefore, that in 1860 he was
chosen President of the United States by the
party whose principles he favored.

You will learn from your history that those
were awful times. The Southern States believed
they had the right to withdraw or secede from
the Union, whenever they chose to do so.
They declared that the election of Abraham
Lincoln, the Republican President, meant a war
against slavery, and ~they joined together in
leaving the Union.

Abraham Lincoln was president throughout the
war for the Union. He was wise and kind
and patient, and no ruler could have done better
than he. The war was hardly ended, when he
was shot by a half—crazy wretch, who earned
eternal infamy for his causeless act, while the
President was mourned thoughout America and
the world. As the years pass, the fact is be-
coming impressed upon all that no greater
American ever lived than Abraham Lincoln.

around the neck of Smith, begged her father to
spare»his life. The king could not refuse his
child. So Smith was allowed to rise to his feet,
his arms were unbound, and, after a time, he went

.back to Jamestown, where the people had given

him up for dead.

Pocahontas is one of the sweetest characters in
our history. She was a great favorite with the
white settlers and made many visits to Jamestown,
where she was treated with great kindness.
\7Vhen she had become a young woman, an Eng-
lish planter, named John Rolfe, formed an affec-
tion for her and she
consented to become
his wife. They were
married in the quaint
old church at Ja1nes-
town, in 1613, and,
three years afterwards,
Rolfe took his dusky
bride to England. She
was called ‘Lady Re-

indeed a princess by the noblest families and by
the sovereign himself and the members of court.

She was so modest tl1at every one loved her. It
is sad to know that while she was making ready
to return to Virginia, she became ill and died. Her
little boy became a leading man in the colony, and
from Pocahontas some of the proudest families
to-day in Virginia claim descent.

Before the marriage of Pocahontas, the colony
underwent such terrible sulferings that it was on
the verge of ruin. An explosion of gunpowder so
injured John Smith that he had to cross the ocean
to England to obtain medical treatment. This was
in 1609, and no sooner had he sailed than the col-
ony fell to pieces. The lazy men stopped working,
sickness broke out, a number seized a boat and be-
came pirates, the Indians killed others and every-
thing went wrong. More immigrants had come tc
Jamestown, so that when Smith left it, they num-
bered four hundred and ninety. A few months
later, only sixty were alive, and these determined to
leave the spot which seemed accursed. They made
a start, but at the mouth of the river, met Lord
Delaware, with new immigrants and, best of all,

plenty of supplies. So they returned to James-_

town and were never again in so sore straits. This
was in the winter of 1609-10 and the dismal period
is known as the “Starving Time.”

In 1619, the governor of the colony thought the
people should have something to say as to how

Epoc/zs in Amerzkan Hzkzory. 17

they were ruled. So he called a meeting, consist-
ing of the governor, council and deputies, or “bur-
gesses,” from the different plantations. They
made a number of laws, which were not to be
binding until agreed to by the council in London,
while those made there should have no force in
Virginia until accepted by the House of Burgesses
,at Jamestown. This meeting was held July 30,
1619, and was the ﬁrst legislative or law-making
body that ever met in America.

It was in the same year that a Dutch vessel
came to Jamestown, having on board twenty
negroes that had been stolen in Africa. The
colonists needed help in planting their crops and in
raising tobacco, and so they bought these negroes,
and others were purchased from time to time.
In this way, African slavery was introduced into
our country.

The colony prospered. The soil was fertile and
plantations were seen for a hundred miles along
the James. Everything was going well when
Powhatan, the father of Pocahontas, who became
a good friend of the whites, died. His son was a
bitter enemy of the settlers, and he formed a plan
for killing them all. In the month of March,
1622, the Indians attacked the settlements so suds
denly that three hundred men, women and children
were killed. The savages were severely punished,

18 Epoc/zs in Ameriam Hzlstory.

but years later, the same chief led another mas-
sacre in which more than ﬁve hundred people
were slain. The colonists now turned upon the
Indians, killed many and drove the remainder so
far back in the forests that they gave no further
trouble.

As the colony grew, England began to treat it
with harshness. In 1660 she ordered that all the
tobacco raised in Virginia should be sent to Eng-
land. The culture of this had become so proﬁtable
that it was grown in the streets of Jamestown.
England ordered further that all the commerce of
the colony should be carried on in English ships.
Since the settlers had built up a proﬁtable trade
with the other colonies that were now ﬂourishing
in different parts of the country, this worked great
hardship and was highly unjust.

Matters grew worse. The assembly at James-
town was composed mainly of dishonest men, who
voted themselves extravagant pay, taxed the people
outrageously, and ﬁned every Quaker or Friend
who failed to attend service in the Church of Eng-
land one hundred dollars a month. Besides this,
the members of council would not go out of ofﬁce
when the terms for which they were elected came
to an end. Governor Berkeley was a tyrant, and,
when the Indians began attacking the outlying

plantations, would do nothing to prevent it, and .

Epoc/zs in Ameriam Ifzktory. 19

forbade any one else to take up arms against the
savages.

The situation soon became intolerable. Nathan-
iel Bacon, a young planter and lawyer, led an ex-

pedition, in 1676, against the Indians and punished
them. Governor Berkeley denounced him as a

20 £‘ﬂ0C/Z‘S in A merz'ca7z Hzktory.

traitor and civil war broke out. The governor
was so detested that he would soon have been over-
thrown, had not Bacon been taken sick and died
in the midst of his successes. The rebellion then
came to an end, and Berkeley took frightful re-
venge upon those that had opposed his rule. He
hanged and imprisoned many, until the king be-
came disgusted and ordered him home to England,
where he soon after died.

During the civil war, the men who rose against
the governor burned Jamestown to prevent the
ruler taking refuge there. In doing this the
patriotic people set ﬁre to their own houses.
Jamestown was never rebuilt and only a few ruins
to-day mark where the first permanent English
settlement was made in this country.

From this time forward the progress of Virginia
was hardly interrupted. It became the most pow-
erful of the thirteen and has always been a leading

state in the Union. Five of the first six Presi- ,

dents were natives of Virginia, which was also the
birthplace of Washington, “the Father of his
Country.” On its soil took place the closing battle
of the Revolution and many of the struggles in
the war for the Union.

SETTLEMENT OF PLYMOUTH.

 HERE was a great
deal of religious
persecution in
En gland during
th e seventeenth
century. Among
those who suﬁered
were the Puritans.
They were mem-
bers of the church
of England, who
disliked some of
its forms and cere-
monies, and tried
to make a change
in them. They
were called in’ derision “Puritans,” because they
sought to lead more godly lives than those who
differed with them.

It must be borne in mind that the Puritans did
not withdraw from the church of England. Some
of those who believed as they did, left that church.
They were called Separatists, because of this separ-

ation, and were known also as Independents. The

-Puritans and Separatists were all non-conformists,

that is, they refused to conform to the rites and
ceremonies of the Church of England.

Many of the Separatists were persecuted so
cruelly in England that they left that country and
settled in Holland. Although they enjoyed peace
there the country was so strange, and the language
and customs so different, that they were never satis-
ﬁed. They turned their thoughts to America, where
they could worship God as they chose and build up a
community composed of their own faith. A number
of them returned to Plymouth, England, from which
port one hundred and two men, women and children
set sail for America in the ship Mayﬂower.

The voyage was long and stormy. It was late
in the autumn when they started and when they
sighted the bleak shores of Cape Cod, where they
landed, it was December 21, 1620, a little more
than seven years after the English settlement had
been made at Jamestown. The Pilgrims, as they
were called because of their wanderings, were

A , sturdy, resolute men of deep piety, who were willing

to face any danger and undergo any sufferings for
the sake of what they believed to be their duty.

The Pilgrims had no charter, but were governed
oy an agreement which was drawn up in the cabin

of the Mayﬂower and signed before the people went

Epoc/25 in Amerzkan Hzktory. 23

ashore. They underwent terrible suﬁerings from
the ﬁrst. The winter was very severe and so many
of the people died that at one time there were only
seven well persons to nurse the sick, and half of those
who had come over died. Happily the Indians did

not molest them, or the ﬁrst Massachusetts colony
must have perished at the beginning of its existence.

The settlers were astonished one day when an
Indian Walked out of the Woods and, coming toward

was treated with great kindness. His name was
Samoset and he had learned the few Words from
some ﬁshermen on the coast of Maine. Soon after
his ﬁrst Visit to Plymouth, he returned with his

Epoch: 2'72 American Hzktory. 25

chief Massasoit, who made a" treaty with the
English that was kept for more than ﬁfty years.
The progress of Plymouth was slow and it never
grew to be a large colony. john Carver the ﬁrst
governor died within a year after landing and was
succeeded by William Bradford, a stern but just
man, who was re-elected for thirty years or until
his death. Once or twice, by begging hard, he
persuaded his people to allow him to rest for one
term. At the end of four years, the number of
settlers at Plymouth was less than two hundred.
Land was then assigned to each settler and the
prosperity and increase became more marked.
Meanwhile, the Massachusetts Bay Colony had
begun settling in the northern part of Massachu-
setts. They were Puritans and had obtained a
grant of land in that section in 1628. In the
following year they sent out small colonies which
settled at Salem and Charlestown. Then all the
ofﬁcers of the company, with its charters and
powers emigrated to Massachusetts Bay. Among
the members of this colony were a number of the
leading ‘Puritan families, including several of
considerable wealth. Governor John Endicott
came over in 1630 with 1,500 emigrants, and began
the settlement of Boston, Cambridge, Lynn, Dor-
chester, Watertown and other places. Although
they underwent many hardships, they prospered

26 Epoc/zs in American Hzklory.

from the ﬁrst and Massachusetts Bay Colony soon
became one of the most powerful in the country.
A most importent step was taken in 1643, when
Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, New Haven and
Connecticut formed a union under the name of The
United Colonies of New ~England. The league

would then perish. He brooded over the matter for
along while, his hatred being intensiﬁed by the
suspicions of the settlers, who called him before
them several times to explain evil reports that
reached them concerning him.
Phillip formed the daring scheme of uniting

 
 

‘Epoch: 2'72 Amerzkan Hzktory. 27

the Indian tribes in war against the white men.
Had he done this, he might have succeeded in his
fearful campaign of blotting all the settlers from
the face of the earth. While he failed in some
instances, he caused the most devastating Indian
war in the early history of our country.

On the fourth of July, 1675, while the people at
Swansea were quietly walking home from church,
they were attacked by Indians, three killed and a
number wounded. The alarm spread and the
settlers ﬂew to arms. The war extended even to

the settlements far up the Conneticut valley.‘

Those were days when people in going to church
carried their muskets with them and stacked them
outside, while sentinels paced back and forth on
the alert for their enemies. Some times the minister
was stopped in the midst of his long sermom by the
ringing war whoop and the warning crack of the
riﬂe, and, hurrying down fro111 his pulpit, joined
the men in repelling their savage assailants.

When it became known that the powerful Nar-
ragansetts were about to oin Phillip, a strong force
of settlers marched a long way through the woods
and attacked their stronghold, where an immense
number had gathered with their winter supplies.
The wigwa ms were burned and more than a thou-
sand of the tribe shot to death.

Phillip was as active as ever, and the following

28 Epoc/as 2'72 American Hzktory.

spring his warriors struck blows iwithinrtwenty
miles of Boston. The settlers, seeing that nothing
would stop the war, except the extermination of
the Indians, hunted them down without mercy.
They gave them no rest, but pursued them day and
night. Phillip was ﬁnally driven into a swamp
near Bristol, Rhode Island and surrounded. In a
desperate attempt to escape, one of his own race,
ﬁghting on the side of the English, shot him dead.
Soon after the war ended.

It will thus be seen that Massachusetts in the
north was much the same as Virginia in the
south. Within their borders were made, respect-
ively, the ﬁrst and second permanent English
settlements. Each underwent many hardships and
there were many similar features in their histories.

In 1675 and ’76 when Bacon’s rebellion was at
its height in Virginia, caused as it will be remem-
bered by attacks of the Indians, Massachusetts
and her sister colonies were ﬁghting the red men
under King Phillip. During the early days at
Jamestown, the colony was saved by the brave,
sturdy, Captain John Smith. Plymouth had a man
of much the same character in Miles Standish,
though his services were less important, because
they were not required by any indolence and lack of
enterprise on the part of the pioneers themselves.

Virginia suffered from bad rulers and the same

Epoc/zs 2'72 Ameriam Hzktory. A 29

aiﬂiction came. to Massachusetts. The order which
England made regarding the commerce of Vir-
ginia bore equally hard upon New England.
Massachusetts had a thriving commerce with the
West Indies, which England aimed to destroy, but
the province disobeyed the decree and opened a
trade with the islands. The royalists were an-
gered and an oﬁcer was sent over to enforce the
Navigation Act, as it was termed. He was resisted,
and then the king took away the charter of Mass-
achusetts and made it a royal province. This was
done in 1684, but before the king could complete
his scheme, he died and was succeeded by James
II, who, in 1686, made Sir Edmund Andros the
ﬁrst royal governor of Massachusetts. Although
he was tyrannical, the colonists got on for three
years under his rule, when they learned that
the king had been dethroned. They then put
Andros in jail and for more than three years
went on as in the olden times. Then Sir William
Phips came over as governor, and Massachusetts
remained a royal province until the Revolution.
Religion was the one great theme of vital interest
to the Pilgrims. They had come to America to
establish a community where they could carry out
their ideas, and they did not intend to let any one
interfere with them. The preaching of the gospel,
the building of churches and the founding of relig-

30 Epoc/zs in Amerzban Hzktory.

ious schools were to them the most exalted work
in which any one could engage. The minister was
the greatest man among them, and no one was
allowed to vote who was not a member of the
Puritan church.

The peopleat Massachusetts Bay were stricter
than at Plymouth. When Roger Williams boldly
preached that in religious matters every one ought
to obey his conscience, and that therefore it was
wrong to arrest a man for blasphemy, or Sabbath
breaking, the authorities felt that that would never
do, and his mouth must be closed without delay.
Williams having failed to heed the warnings sent
to him was banished to England. Instead of obey-
ing, however, he ﬂed in the depth of winter to the
dismal woods, tramping over the snow and in the
face of the cutting wind until he reached the lodge
of Canonicus, who was chief of the most powerful
tribe of Indians in New England.

Canonicus knew Williams and was friendly to-
ward him. He gave him welcome and presented
him with a large tract of land. Williams began a
settlement (1636), which in gratitude to God he
called Providence. It has long been one of the
principal cities in New England.

Mrs. Anne Hutchinson about the same time
threw the community in an uproar by her teaching
of new religious doctrines. The only way to silence

Epoc/zs in Amerzmiz Hzktory. 31

her was by banishment. She went to Rhode
Island, where she was welcomed by Roger Wil-
liams. Then she passed over among the Dutch
of New Netherland, where one night she was killed
during an attack by Indians.

The Quakers caused the most trouble, for it
seemed impossible to quiet them. They were ﬁned
and whipped but seemed to care little for that.
When they were sent out of the colony and warned
that if they returned they would be put to death, they
came right back again. In obedience to a law
passed in 1656, four of the Quakers were executed,
but this cruel persecution ﬁnally came to an end.

The most hideous delusion in our history broke
out in Salem, in 1692. Two little girls, daughters
of a minister, indulged in a number of silly pranks
for which they ought to have been punished; but
when they declared that they had been bewitched,
the foolish people believed them. The children
accused a servant, who to end the beating to which
she was subjected, confessed that she was the witch
that had done the mischief. .

Others were affected, and straightway it seemed
that the whole community went crazy. Nothing
was too wild to be believed. Reverend Mr. Bur-
roughs, one of the best and most lovable of men,
was summoned to Salem, where he had been form-
erly stationed, to stand trial on the charge of witch-

32 Epoc/zs 2'72 Amerzkcm Hzktory.

craft. He was an athlete, and because of his great
strength was accused. He was pronounced guilty
and hanged, praying for his executioners at the
foot of the gallows. There was so much sympathy
for him that a rescue was likely. Seeing this, Cotton
Mather passed through the crowd, warning the
people that it was a favorite device of the devil to
assume the most winning form and manner.

A little child accused her grandfather and then
denied it. Nevertheless the old man was hanged.
In one case, the dog of a man who was executed
showed evidence of being affected by witchcraft, so
he, too, was hanged. It is inconceivable in these
days how such madness could exist, for ﬁfty-ﬁve
persons had been tortured, and twenty put to death,
before the horrible delusion passed away and the
people regained their senses.

ern bounderies had been generally deﬁned as the
Paciﬁc Ocean, none of them reached far in that
direction. Beyond the Alleghenies was a vast
wilderness, inhabited by wild beasts and Indians.

France had gained possession of Canada, with
little trouble, and then began pushing down the
Mississippi Valley toward the Gulf of Mexico.
She had a chain of sixty forts, stretching from
Montreal to New Orleans. Her desire was to
found a great empire in the Mississippi Valley.

But while she was forcing her way southward,
the English were drawing near from the east. The
two advance armies, as they may be called, were
converging at right angles, and a collision was at
hand. The English settlers passed over the Alle-
ghenies and drew near the French chain of forts.
Learning of their approach, the French began
building new forts to keep out the English, who
they insisted were invading territory that belonged
to France.

We have learned how Governor Dinwiddie, of
Virginia, sent young George Washington ﬁve
hundred miles through the wilderness, to deliver
a letter to the French commander, reminding him
that he was an intruder upon English ground and
must leave. We have learned, too, that the French
oﬂicer refused, and in 1754, ﬁghting began between
the colonies and the French. It went on with little

Eporﬁs 2°12 Amerzkan Hzklory. 35

real progress for a time, but the greatest gain was
by France. England would have been glad to have
the American colonies do all her ﬁghting on this
side of the ocean, but when France began sending
armed forces hither, England did the same, and, in
1756, war was declared between the two nations.
Even after this step had been taken, England for
a time was very lax. The officers whom she sent
to command her armies i11 America had little ability,
or what is worse, did not make use of what they did

i have. They marched their troops here and there,

without any well deﬁned plan of campaign, while
the French forces, although fewer in number, were

_ commanded by Montcalm, one of the greatest of

soldiers. He concentrated his troops and struck so
powerful blows, that, at the end of 1757, it looked as
if the English were to bedefeated at every point,
and the French were to become the masters of
America. Montcalm captured the Engiish forts on
the northern border of New York and was wise
enough to draw the Indians to his support.

But the year 1758 brought an amazing change.
William Pitt, one of the greatest men that England
ever produced, was placed at the head of the British
government. His tremendous energy and ability
were soon felt in every direction. He knew all
about affairs in America, and saw what must be
done to avert the disgrace of overwhelming defeat.

36 Epochs in American Hzktory.

He proceeded at once to “weed out” the oﬁicers who
had been in command long enough to prove their
worthlessness, and to replace them with the best
that the British army could furnish.

An expedition was sent against the formidable
stronghold of Louisburg, on Cape Breton Island, and
it was captured in the month of July. A few
months later, Fort Du Quesne was taken without

resistance. The little collection of cabins received

the name of Pittsburgh, in compliment to the British
prime minister, and has long been one of our lead-
ing cities. The expedition against Ticonderoga,
however, failed. ‘Montcalm was commander there
and he defeated the British troops with heavy
loss.

The British were now steadily gaining, and un-
der the masterly genius of Pitt, they pressed their
successes at every point. Montcalm, knowing that
they meant to attack Quebec, was forced to draw in
his troops from other points to the defense of that
city. As a consequence, Ticonderoga, Crown Point
and a fort at Niagara, were captured by the English
almost without resistance.

By this time, England had ﬁfty thousand troops
in the ﬁeld, a force almost two-thirds as great as the
population of Canada, and six times greater than
France could muster in America. Pitt was deter-
mined to conquer Canada, and placed the exp‘e‘ditio‘n

Epocks 2'72 Amerfcan Hzklory. 37

in charge of General James Wolfe, only thirty-four
years old, and one of the most brilliant of English
ofﬁcers. In June he left Louisburg with eight
thousand men and a ﬂeet of forty-four vessels, un-
der Admirals Saunders and Holmes. Arriving at
the Isle of Orleans, on the 27th of june, a camp was
made on the upper end of the island. Point Levi
was seized and General Monckton planted a battery
opposite the city. The lower town, consisting of
only a few houses, was easily reduced, but no im-
pression was made on the citadel in the upper
town.

Quebec stands on a lofty promontory at the
junction of the St. Lawrence and ‘St. Charles rivers.
The citadel ‘on the highest portion is three hun-
dred and forty ﬁve feet above the water, while the
fortiﬁcations, extending almost across the peninsula,
inclose a circuit of about three miles. To the west
of them are the Heights of Abraham. The front is
a steep precipice, rising three hundred feet, an
ascent that was deemed so well nigh insurmount-
able that the French. extended their intrenchments,
from the northern shore of the St. Lawrence, for
ﬁve miles from the Montmorenci to the St. Charles.
The force under the command of Montcalm was
somewhat greater than that of the English.

On the night of the 28th, the French sent a
number of ﬁre-ships adrift, hoping that as they

38 Epoc/zs 2'12 Ameriam Hzktory.

swept down with the tide, they would destroy the
English ﬂeet, but those that did not explode before
reaching the vessels were easily towed ashore by
the British sailors, who considered it great sport.
The English ﬁnally decided upon making the
almost hopeless attempt of ﬁnding some way by
which the Heights of Abraham could be climbed,
and an attack made on the rear of Quebec. Accord-
ingly, on the 6th of September, the troops and
artillery were taken over to Point Levi. Wolfe,
now with a view of deceiving the enemy, moved his
army to a point several miles up the river, all the
time assiduously hunting for some path that would
afford the coveted means of ascent. He discovered
the place known as Wolf ’s Cove, and determined
that the attempt should be made at that point.
About two o’clock in the morning the tide began

to ebb, and a brisk breeze stirred the pine woods .

and rippled the surface of the water. Two lanterns
twinkled from the mainmast of the Suzi/zerlmza’,
Wolf ’s Vessel, as the signal that the movement was
about to begin. In the small boats were Wolfe
and sixteen hundred men, and in the sloops and
frigates about as many more. The latter were
ordered to follow slowly,but to be ready to support
the smaller boats when they made their ﬁrst land-
ing. Other troops were waiting on the south shore
to join in the movement.

E poc/zs 2'72 Aimericavz Hzktory. 39

The convoy drifted down stream in the darkness,
no one speaking above a whisper, and only as few
ofﬁcers beside Wolfe knowing their destination.

Twice the boats were challenged by a French

sentinel, but a Highland officer who spoke French
ﬂuently replied in that tongue, so that suspicion
was lulled.

At the base of the cliff, where it was two
hundred feet high, the men landed like so many

shadows. Grasping the sparse bushes which grew ‘

here and there, and keeping as near together as
they could, the light infantry and Highlanders

‘ reached the top of the summit just as it was begin-

ning to grow light in the east. Through the gloom
they perceived a cluster of tents, at which they
dashed, overcoming the small force which would
not have been more amazed by an attack from an
army of phantoms.

Hearing the ﬁring Wolfe and the remainder of
the men hastily scrambled upward,‘ while the ships
and transports advanced rapidly to the support of
the boats. Within half an hour the last of the
forty-ﬁve hundred troops were winding their way
up the ascent. Day dawned with a thin, misty
rain falling, as the British army drew up in battle
array on the Heights of Abraham.

Montcalm refused to believe the astounding news
until he had mounted his horse and ridden to where

40 Epoc/zs in Amerz'ca7z Hzktory.

he saw the long band of scarlet stretching across
the whole width of the plain, and heard the rattle
of the musketry ﬁring. He lost no time in pre-
paring for the battle, which was to prove one of
the n1ost decisive in history. By nine o’clock, all
the French troops, ﬁve thousand in number, were
formed in line of battle, with six hundred yards
separating the two armies.

The drizzling rai11 ceased falling when, a few
minutes before ten o’clock, Montcalm, mounted on
a ﬁne black charger, led his men to the attack.
When within two hundred yards his troops opened
ﬁre, but the English stood at “shoulder arms,”
under strict orders to reserve their ﬁre. The
bullets pattered around them, inflicting some loss
of life, and a bullet passed through Wolfe’s wrist,
but he hastily wound a handkerchief around it, and
running back and forth along the ranks, warned
his men to reserve their ﬁre.

They obeyed to a man. When the shouting
French were within thirty-ﬁve yards, and the whites
of their eyes could be seen through the rifts of
smoke, the English delivered a volley which in-
ﬂicted awful destruction. The French ofﬁcers,
after the battle, declared that never in all their
experience had they witnessed anything like it.
As the smoke cleared, the French were seen
lying in heaps, and it seemed that more men were

Epocﬁs 2'72 Americmz Hzktory. 41

stretched on the ground than were standing on
their feet.

Neither Montcalm nor his horse had been struck,
and he gallopped back and forth striving desper-
ately to allay the panic and rally his men. When
the English had reloaded, Wolfe, sword in hand,
placed himself at the head of his grenadiers and
ordered the whole line to advance. Delivering
another terriﬁc volley they dashed down upon the
shattered foe who were driven before them, but the
sharpshooters in the woods kept up a galling ﬁre.
Wolfe forgot his bleeding wrist, and was cheering
his men, when he was struck in the groin by a
bullet. It was a mortal wound, but paying no
heed to it, he kept on, the light of triumph making
his homely face glow with a strange ﬁre. A few
minutes later, a bullet passed through his lungs.
He staggered a few paces, striving to keep to his
feet, but seeing he could not, called to an ofﬁcer
to support himiso that his men should not see him
fall. The ofﬁcer ran forward, but before he could
reach him, Wolfe sank to the ground. Only four
persons noticed his fall and they hastily carried
him to the rear.

While on the way, he asked them to lay him
down. One of them proposed to bring a surgeon,
but Wolfe shook his head.

“It is useless,” he said, sinking into a stupor.

42 Epocks 2'72 Amerzkan Hzktory;

At that moment, one of his attendants looked
around and excitedly called, “They run! they run!”

DEATH OF WOLFE.

“Who run?” asked Wolfe, rousing himself.
“The French; they are giving away every-
where,” Was the reply.

E1505/zs z'7z ./4merz'ca7z Hzktory. 43

Wolfe issued several orders about cutting off
the retreat of the fugitives, and then, turning on
his side murmured, “God be praised; now I die
happy,” and closing his eyes, and without a
struggle or evidence of pain, he passed away.

Meanwhile, Montcalm kept up his efforts to
stay the panic of his men and to rally them into
something like organized resistance. Fully as
brave, skillful and chivalrous as Wolfe, he never
held a thought of personal danger, but the task

he had undertaken was beyond the power of any -

man. He was caught in the torrent of fugitives
and borne along, like a piece of drift wood in a
whirlpool. When near the city a shot passed
through his body, but he kept his seat in the saddle,
and, supported by two soldiers, was borne with the
hurrying throng through the St. Louis gate. The
sight of blood streaming down his clothing caused
several to cry out in dismay, but Montcalm called
that his hurt was triﬂing and begged them to give
themselves no anxiety for him.

The English had lost between six and seven
hundred men in killed and wounded, that of the
French being probably double that number. They
were so demoralized that most of them ﬂed from
the city, which was left with a motley garrison
of about twelve hundred men, with double that
number of women, children and invalids, and with

so scant a supply of food that they were in danger
of starvation.

The surgeons who came to attend Montcalm told
him his Wound was mortal. “How long have I to
live?” he calmly asked. “Perhaps twelve hours,”
was the reply.

“ So much the better,” he added, “for then I
shall not see the surrender of Quebec.” He died
just before daylight on the following morning.

Canada was fully conquered in the following
year. Montreal surrendered and the other French
forts were turned over to the English as fast as
they sent garrisons to take charge of them. Peace
was made at Paris in 1763. By its provisions,
Spain ceded Florida to England, and France gave
to the same nation all her territory east of the

Mississippi, with the exception of two small‘

islands south of Newfoundland which she kept
as ﬁshing stations. At the same time she surren-
dered New Orleans and all her territory west
of the Mississippi to Spain. ‘

The capture of Quebec was one of the great
battles of the world; for, from what has ust been
stated, it will be seen that it changed the destiny
of America. France had been driven out and
England was now the master.

The French and Indian War bore heavily upon
the colonies. They did most of the ﬁghting, and
thirty thousand lives were lost. They had spent
$16,000,000, of which England gave back to them
less than one-third. In some cases, the taxes were
so enormous that men had to pay two-thirds of

46 E1606/zs in Amerzkan Hzktory.

their income, but there was little complaint, for the
taxes were laid by their own representatives, and
the colonies were united in their determination to
root out French rule from their soil.

In one respect, the French and Indian War was
of incalculable advantage to this country. It al-
layed the ealousies that were growing between
sections, because of diverse ideas and interests, and
made brothers of all. Better yet, it had served as
a training school for the officers who were to be the
leaders in the struggle for independence. Wash-
ington, ‘Stark, Montgomery, Gates, Putnam, Ar-
nold, Morgan and many others became well
grounded in the science of war, and ﬁtted, when
the time should come, to strike effective blows
against even the British regulars under their vet-
eran ofﬁcers.

The population of the colonies at the close of the
French and Indian War was about 2,000,000.
This was a large increase for those times, and the
American people had learned their strength. They
began to speak of themselves as Americans and to
ask one another why they should remain dependent
upon a country three thousand miles away, which
left them to do most of her ﬁghting on this side of
the Atlantic, and used them mainly to tax all the
money that was possible to obtain from them.

Had England treated the colonies justly, they

Epoc/zs 2°72 Ameriam Hzklory. 47.

would have made no attempt at independence in
1775. They would have waited many years
longer, and, when the time came, as it was sure to
do, it is likely that the separation would have been
peaceful. _

But it seemed as if the “mother country,” as
England was called, was bent on doing all she
could to make her American children rebel. Her
officers sneered at the provincials, as the Americans
were termed, the most burdensome of taxes were
laid, trade was crippled, tyrannical laws enforced,
and when complaint was made,. those who com-
plained were told to go about their business.

. George the Third was King of Great Britain. He

was stubborn and a part of the time insane. He
was not willing to do justice to the Americans,
who had been loyal and devoted to him. When at
last the suffering colonies asked that they should
have one or two of their own number in the British
Parliament, the body that makes laws for England

- and her colonies, that too, was refused.

At last the Americans lost patience. They de-
clared that they would not obey some of the obnox-
ious laws. They refused to pay the unjust taxes.
They were not afraid of the British regulars, nor
of England itself, which was trying to play the
bully over them. They were so angered that they
were ready to ﬁght for their rights.

48 Epoc/zs in Amerzkan Hzkiory.

Massachusetts took the leading part in the re-
volt. She, as well as the other colonies, was so de-
ﬁant, that England, too, lost her temper. She for-
bade all vessels to enter or leave Boston harbor.
This destroyed the trade of that port, as it was
meant to do, but the other colonies sent relief to
the suffering people in Boston, and those who were
thinking of independence became more closely
united and determined than ever before.

England made another law which took away the
charter of Massachusetts, so that the people, instead
of governing themselves, as they had been doing,
were ruled by the agents of the king. The re-
mainder of the colonies saw that the same order
was likely at any time to be issued against them,
and they became more resolute in their resistance.
A third act ordered that all Americans who com-
mitted the crime of murder should be sent to Eng-
land for trial, while a fourth made all the country
north of the Ohio and east of the Mississippi a
part of Canada. This was specially hateful to the
colonies, for, having conquered" the territory from
the French, they felt that it belonged to them.

To enforce these odious laws, England sent an
army to fassachusetts. General Gage was ap-
pointed military governor, and the whole country
was seething with excitement. The sight of the
“red coats” marching through the streets of Boston

Epoc/zs 2'72 A merican Hzktory. 49

incensed the people. Several affrays took place in
which lives were lost, while everybody saw that
a ﬁght for independence must soon begin.

General Gage became alarmed at the activity of
the patriots around him. He knew that “minute
men” were organizing by the thousands and drill-
ing day and night. Powder and arms were being
collected and Americans were hurrying from all
directions to Boston, to take part in the ﬁghting
that was at hand.

The spies which General Gage sent into the sur-
rounding country brought back word that the
“rebels,” as the patriots were called, had collected
a large amount of military supplies at Concord,_a
village about twenty miles from Boston. Gage de-
termined to destroy them and sent eight hundred
men for that purpose. He took this step with the
utmost secrecy, for he did not mean that the
Americans should learn of his intention. The
start was made at night, April 18th, 1775, and oﬂi-
cers were stationed at the outlets from Boston to

prevent any of the citizens hurrying away with the _

alarm, but the intention of the soldiers had been
known or at least suspected by the Americans for
hours.

Hardly had the troops started, when the crowds
of patriots watching the belfry of the Old North
Church, saw two points of light ﬂash out like stars.

on the race that was to make him famous. Revere

sped with arrowy swiftness down the highway?”
Two British ofﬁcers threw themselves across the
road to check him, but he sheered to one side and
sped away like a thunderbolt.

He was soon at Medford, where he roused the
“minute men” and then away he ﬂew for Lexing-
ton, his shouts awaking the slumbering people with

the startling news. He reached the town at mid- '

night, and, being joined by two companions, made
all haste for Concord. On the way, his companions
stopped to alarm a household while Revere waited
for them in the road. Suddenly he was surrounded
by four oﬁicers who made him prisoner. His
friends, however, escaped and continued their work
of rousing the people.

But the task was already ﬁnished. The colonel
who was advancing with the eight hundred red
coats saw the hurrying swarms, the lights twink-
ling everywhere, and heard the shouts. and the
ringing of alarm bells. He knew he had a ﬁerce
ﬁght before him, and he sent an aide, riding hard
into Boston, with word to General Gage that unless
he sent him reinforcements, he and all his men
would be cut OH. Gage despatched help at nine
o’clock that morning.

pouches and ﬂint locks, sped from all directions
toward the commons at Lexington. There were
between one and two hundred under the command
of Captain John Parker, who ordered them to load
with powder and ball, but not to ﬁre until after the
British. He knew how important it was that he
and his fellow patriots should stand right in the
eyes of the country and of the world.

Just as the gray light appeared in the east, the
British soldiers were seen bearing down upon them.
They wore brilliant uniforms and marched with a
steady, even step, as if on parade. Major Pitcairn,
mounted on a ﬁne horse, was at their head, sword
in hand. Stopping his soldiers, who were only
the advance of the main body, he rode forward and
called out to the minute men:

“Disperse, you rebels! disperse!”

“We are on our own ground where we have a
right,” was the reply, “and we will stay!”

It will never be known of a certainty who ﬁred
the ﬁrst shot at Lexington. As has been stated,
Captain Parker cautioned his men to wait until
they were attacked. The soldiers were just as
anxious that the Americans should ﬁre ﬁrst and
they, too, waited to be attacked. Pitcairn’s truth-
fulness was so well known, that it was afterwards
said to him by the leading Americans who invest-
igated the affair, that if he would declare of his

own knowledge that one of the minute men dis-
charged the ﬁrst gun, his statement would be ac-
cepted. Pitcairn would not say this, though he
did say that he was morally certain that such was
the fact. A gun was ﬁred and his horse was struck.
He believed that the bullet was intended for him.
Several scattering shots followed from both sides,
and then the soldiers delivered a volley right
among the minute men, which stretched a number
dead and dying on the ground.

That was the volley that “was heard round
the world.” It opened the Revolution and
the struggle which did not end until the thirteen
colonies had become a free and independent
nation.

The ﬁre was returned in a random way by the
patriots, who killed one soldier and wounded sev-
eral. The volley of the British was repeated and
eight patriots were slain and a number wounded.
Then the troops withdrew and marched in the
direction of Concord, where they destroyed a

quantity of military stores, which was the cause of V

their going thither. The Americans were too few
in number to oppose, and they retreated across the
Concord River and took position on a hill behind
the village.

While the soldiers were hunting through the

houses for the hidden stores, ﬁring from the North

bridge showed that ﬁghting was going on there.
The minute men, hastening to the place, saw the
soldiers tearing up the planks of the bridge. The
patriots received three volleys as they approached
and returned the ﬁre. The soldiers fell back, a11d,
having ﬁnished the work which had brought them
to the place, the whole body of troops set out on
their return to Boston.

Hitherto the British soldiers had showed good
discipline, marching with even step and promptly
obeying the commands of their officers, but dis-
order and something in the nature of a panic now
took possession of them. The surrounding country
was swarming with minute men and patriots who
were converging from all directions, all eager to
gain a shot at the retreating soldiers.

There were old men and boys, many of them
bareheaded and only partly clothed. They had
left home so hurriedly that they could not take
time to dress fully. In their ardor, many ﬁred
when too far off to be effective. Then they paused
and hastily reloaded. The bullet was’ rammed
down the long barrel, the powder hurriedly poured
into the pan, a11d the American would break into
a run, until panting and ﬂustered, he was near
enough to try it again. Then he would stop,
take aim and let ﬂy, keeping this up as long as his
amunition lasted.

But scores gathered in front of the troops and
from behind barns, stone fences, bushes, fences and
everything that gave the slightest protection, they
drew bead on the red coats, who continually top-
pled over by the wayside. Now and then, too, some
soldier sent a bullet through the head or body of
his crouching assailant, who rolled over never to
rise again.

In the early morning it had been chilly, but it
was now smotheringly hot. The retreating soldiers
suffered dreadfully. They were exhausted from
their long march, the dust and the heat, and many
fell down from weakness, while others dragged
themselves wearily forward, unable to raise their
muskets to ﬁre, and caring little what became of
them.

Their condition became so desperate that they
would have been cut off to a man, had not the
twelve hundred reinforcements sent by Gage ar-
rived at the critical moment. They formed a hol-
low square into which the sorely pressed stragglers

' staggered. Then the fresh troops opened on the
Americans with their artillery and held them at

bay, though they were not dispersed.

The connnander of the reinforcements saw that
his whole force would be overwhelmed if he stayed
where he was; so, after a half hour’s rest, the re-
treat was resumed, but the soldiers were harassed

Epoc/zs 2°72 Ameriam Hzklory. 57

as before at every step; for, although their num-
ber was more than doubled, their assailants were
increased three and four-fold.

The retreat to Boston was attended by the same
frightful scenes that marked that from Lexington.
The patriots, kneeling behind every possible pro-
tection and frequently standing out in the open,
where they were exposed, ﬁred upon the British as
fast as they could reload and aim their guns. The
enemy retreated rapidly, and no persons could
have been more relieved than they, when, late in
the afternoon, they reached the protection of sev-
eral men-of-war, and, crossing the Charles River,
were at last safe in Boston. '

It had been a day of unparalleled excitement,
and Beacon Hill was swarming with citizens peer-
ing through the gathering gloom for sight of the
retreating enemy, who were ﬁrst seen by the ﬂash
of their guns and the spouting ﬂame of the cannon,
turned upon the patriots, who were hurrying them
at every step.

The exact number of killed and wounded in the
battle of Lexington is not known with certainty.
The ﬁgures generally accepted are forty-nine
Americans killed, thirty-six wounded and ﬁve miss-
ing; that of the British, sixty-ﬁve killed, one hun-
dred and seventy-eight wounded and twenty-six
missing.

The battle of Lexington marked an epoch in
American history, because, as has been stated, it
ushered in the Revolution, or the struggle for in-
dependence. There being no telegraph or rail-
ways in those days, the news was borne from col-
ony to colony by men mounted on swift horses.
The tidings set the country aﬂame. _Patriots ﬂew
to arms and thousands hastened to Boston to help

the summer of 1776.

As has been already explained, the purpose of
many of the Americans at ﬁrst was not of sepera-
tion from England, but rather to compel that
country to be just to them. The ﬁghting would
have stopped almost at any time, had King George
and his Parliament shown a disposition to treat
them fairly. The Continental Congress, in session

60 Epoc/zs 2'72 Amerzkcm Hzktory.

in Philadelphia, was mild in its actions, but the
people were fully roused and determined to main-
tain the struggle until they gained their liberty.
Congress at last caught the thrill and began debat-
ing the question with more earnestness than before.

Washington had been appointed comn1ander-in-
chief of the American forces and had gone to
Boston to take command. It was his ﬁne general-
ship which compelled Gage to withdraw from the
city and go with all his army to Halifax. All
now saw that the great problem was to be settled
by the sword, and the able men who gathered at
Philadelphia spent many hours and days in discus-
sing the momentous subject.

On the 8th of June, Richard Henry Lee, of
Virginia, offered the following resolutions:

“That these united colonies are, and of right ought to be,

"free, independent States; that they are absolved from all

allegiance to the British crown; and that all political con-
nection between them and the State of Great Britian is, and
ought to be, totally dissolved.

“That it is expedient forthwith to take the most effectual
measures for forming foreign alliances.

“That a plan of confederation be prepared and transmitted
to the respective colonies for their consideration and support. ”

It will be seen that if action on this question
should be in the affirmative, it would be of the
highest importance, since it would be a total break-
ing off of all allegiance to the mother country.

Epoch? 2'72 Americcm Hzktory. 61

England would consider the act high treason, for
which the punishment has always been death. If
the colonies failed in the struggle, such was likely
to be the fate of every member of Congress who
signed the declaration.

No thought, however, of personal danger affected
any one of those brave men.

“In considering this measure,” remarked one of
the members during the debate, “it is necessary
that we should all hang together.”

“Yes,” replied Benjamin Franklin, then seventy
years old, but one of the most active of the dele-
gates, “for, if we don’t we shall hang separately.”

“The gentleman misunderstands me,” observed
the other; “I mean that we must be unanimous
in our sentiments—all of one accord.”

“King George will be satisﬁed with any cord so
that it is a strong one,” retorted the witty Franklin.

After discussion, action on the resolution was
postponed for two days, when it was again laid
over until Monday, the 1st of July. By that time
it was clear what the action would be, and a com-
mittee was appointed to prepare a Declaration of
Independence. The committee consisted of
Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Frank-
lin, Roger Sherman and R. R. Livingston. Jeffer-
son was a brilliant writer, but a poor speaker. He
‘wrote the entire declaration and submitted it to

62 Epoc/zs in Ameriam Hzklory.

Adams and Franklin‘, who proposed a few slight
changes. The credit of that immortal document
belongs to Jefferson. He was a great and learned
man and one of our best Presidents. He did many
notable things, but was prouder of having written
the Declaration of Independence than of all his
other actions. By his request the fact was en-
graved on his tombstone.

Jefferson left the discussion to his brother mem-
bers. Several of them were inclined to defer
action, thinking that the hour had not quite come
for taking the irrevocable step, but the sentiment
was overwhelmingly in favor of doing so without
further delay.

Jefferson reported his paper to Congress on the
28th of June, when it was read and laid on the
table. Discussion ended on the advisability of the
step on the 2nd of July, when the Declaration was
taken up and considered in detail. This debate
lasted until the afternoon of the Fourth of July,
when it was signed by every member present, ex-
cept Dickinson, of Pennsylvania, who favored
postponing action.

John Hancock was the president of Congress and

i signed ﬁrst. His signature is one of the finest of the

lot, standing out in large, clear, beautiful charac-
ters. The story is told that he cut off the nib of

V his quill pen with his knife, and after writing his

Eﬁocks in Amerzkan Hzklory. 63

signature, remarked: “There! John Bull can see
that without spectacles."

After Hancock came the names of the delegates
from New Hampshire, Massacl1usettes, Rhode
Island and Connecticut, New York (signed the
following week), New jersey, Pennsylvania, Dela-
ware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina and Georgia. By permission, Matthew
Thornton, of New Hampshire, signed on the 4th of
the following November.

Some one remarked to Charles Carroll that there
were so many with the same name that it would be
hard to indentify him. So he added to his signa-
ture, “of Carrollton.” Not a man of them was afraid.

When the hour for action came, the streets of
Philadelphia were crowded with people, whose
excitement was as intense as that of the delegates
discussing the all important question. Early in
the day, the aged bell ringer took his station, and
placed his boy below with orders to let him know
the moment when the signing was made. The
time wore on and the old man was becoming im-
patient. “They will never do it,” he murmured
with a heavy heart; “no; they will never do it!”

Suddenly his boy leaped up, clapped his hands
and shouted, “Rzkzg, fat/227*, rz'7zg./ ” The parent, in
a glow of ardor, did ring the old bell as it was
never rung before. Other steeples joined in the

clamor, and the thousands in the streets shouted
and embraced each other with oy. The city was
illuminated at night,“cannon boomed, and frantic
rejoicing was everwhere.

What a strange co-incidence that on the old
bell which pealed out the glad tidings these words

were inscribed : “Proclaim liberty throughout all .

the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.”

Two of the most precious heirlooms of our
country, are the original Declaration of Indepen-
ence, guarded with ealous care among the choicest
treasures of the government, and the old Liberty
Bell, mounted on the lower ﬂoor of Independence
Hall, where all may see it. It is cracked, and its
iron tongue has long been
f5—,£:fi silent, and it was well that it

_,  ;T'°"is so, for the message which
9' it sent forth on the afternoon

 

‘   of July 4th, 1776, was the most
W-"' glorious that ever pealed from

a few minutes. Multitudes of school children

‘garlanded it with ﬂowers and sang odes of welcome.

In these pilgrimages, the Liberty Bell continues
its sacred mission of diffusing and impressing the
spirit of patriotism upon young and old alike.
Thus, though it has no life, it speaks with a most
eloquent tongue. I

Having adopted the Declaration of Independ-
ence, Congress ordered copies to be printed and

sent to the different assemblies, conventions and_

committees or councils of safety and to the com-
manding ofﬁcers of the Continental troops. It was
ordered, further, that it should be read in each State
and at the head of the American army.

Delay in printing the document prevented a
public celebration in Philadelphia until the 8th of
July. An immense multitude gathered in front of
Independence Hall at noon, when John Nixon, a
member of the Committee of Safety, read the paper
in a clear, ringing voice, to which the listeners re-
sponded with cheers. The remainder of the day
was spent in jolliﬁcation, and once more the Old
Liberty Bell sent its glad notes ringing over the
town and across the calmly ﬂowing Delaware.

The news of the signing of the Declaration ran
like wildﬁre from state to state, and awoke unre-
strained enthusiasm. In New York a leaden statue
of King George stood in Bowling Green. The
head was kno"cke'd off and the rest melted into

forty thousand bullets that were used in ﬁghting
the battles of the Revolution. Wherever the
symbols of royalty were seen they were torn down
and destroyed. Timid patriots became outspoken,
and those who dared to condemn the action of
Congress or express a wish for the success of the
British arms did so at the risk of their lives. The
whole country was aglow with patriotic ardor and
enthusiasm.

England did not relax her efforts to bring back
her subject, simply because they had declared in
this formal manner that they were no longer
bound to her. She was then the most powerful
nation in the world ; King George was incensed to
the highest degree, and resolved to conquer the
rebels at whatever cost.

And in truth dark days for the patriots were at
hand. The struggle had only begun and it was
to be a long, discouraging and trying one, but the
sun of American liberty having risen, might be
obscured for a time by mists and clouds, but never
was it to set again.

til many of those that had been the most clamorous
for resistance to England, gave up hope and de-
clared that it was impossible for the young States
to succeed in their struggle against the mightiest
nation of the globe, which was putting forth every
effort to conquer her rebellious children on this side

of the Atlantic. The ﬁres of patriotism died out in
thousands of hearts,.and many a brave 111a11 who had
eagerly shouldered his musket turned from the
scenes of conflict and went back to his impoverished
home.

Washington and his patriot ofﬁcers, however,
never lost heart. They had foreseen that this
period of discouragement and defeat must come,
but it served only to make them more determined
to ﬁght it out to the end, assured that success was
as certain to dawn upon their arms, as the day is to
follow the night.

Howe, the British general, increased his forces to
thirty thousand well trained soldiers, with half of
which he crossed from New York to Brooklyn,
which was then only a ferry station. Five thou-
sand Americans were near Brooklyn under the
command of General Putman. He was completely
outgeneralled in August by Howe, and lost two
thousand men. The remainder escaped to Brook-
lyn and took refuge in a fort. Had Howe pressed
his advantage, he would have defeated and captured
every man; but he hesitated for two days, during
which a heavy fog enabled Washington to bring
the garrison safely to New York. With his im-
mensely superior force, Howe followed Washing-
ton, who was falling back slowly before him.
There was ﬁghting at Harlem a11d White Plains,

70 Epoc/zs 2'12 Americcm Hzklory.

and, near Peekskill, Washington turned at bay.
Instead of making an attack, Howe with-
drew to New Jersey, capturing on the way, Fort
Washington and its garrison of three thousand
men.

Leaving General Charles Lee to hold the vaca-
ted position near Peekskill, Washington passed
over the Hudson with ﬁve thousand troops to a
point nearly opposite the city. At the opening of
winter, Lord Cornwallis crossed the river and
Washington was again compelled to retreat, mov-
ing southward through New jersey toward Phila-
delphia, with the enemy in so hot pursuit that the
rear guard of the patriots often exchanged shots
with the advance of the British army. ' ‘

It was a dismal march for the Americans. Most
of the men were in rags, they had no money and
were famishing for food. The ground in many
places was covered with snow, and the weather was
bitterly cold. Some of the patriots were actually
bare-foot, and as they tramped over the frozen
roads, they left bloody footprints. No wonder that
when Washington reached the Delaware and
crossed at Trenton, that he had barely three
thousand left.

The despair was so general that hundreds of
people hastened to place themselves under British
protection. It seemed as if every house passed by

Epochs 2'72 Amerzkan Hzkiory. 71

the Continentals had a piece of red ﬂannel tacked
in front, to signify they were loyal subjects of King
George. Some of the ofﬁcers even applied for such
protection.

Trenton, the capital of New Jersey, was occupied
by Colonel Rall and ﬁfteen hundred Hessians.
These were German soldiers that Great Britain
had hired to help ﬁght her battles in this country.
They had no fear of the “ragamufﬁns,” who were
shivering on the other side of the Delaware, and
enjoyed themselves in drinking, carousing and
doing as they pleased in the little town.

Colonel Rall made his headquarters at the house
of Abraham Hunt, one of the leading merchants.
He was fond of playing cards with Hunt and drink-
ing toddy. He often sat up n1ost"of the night, and
was glad indeed that he could have such good times
without any thought of molestation from the rebels,

that had been driven across the river and out of the

State.

On Christmas night, 1776, Rall ‘and Hunt were
playing cards and smoking as usual, and quafﬁng
hot toddy. A storm of sleet moaned about the
house and rattled against the windows. It was a
most cheerless night, when any one would be glad
to ﬁnd shelter, and would enjoy the glow of the
crackling wood ﬁre which warmed the Hessian and
his host.

72 Epoc/zs in Ameﬂam Hzkiory.

Suddenly there was a resounding knock at the
front door, and a minute later the servant entered
the room with a letter directed to Colonel Rall.
Just then the ofﬁcer was in the midst of a game of
cards, and taking the missive, he slipped it into his
pocket, intending to read it when the game was
ﬁnished. Instead, however, of doing so, he forgot
it. Had he remembered to read the letter, the his-
tory of the important events that speedily followed
would have been changed. ’

Washington from the other side of the Delaware
resolved to strike a blow that would raise the
drooping hopes of his countrymen. For months
the armies had done little except to ﬁght, and re-
treat, until there was reason for the general despair
of the patriots. His plan was to recross the Dela-
ware, surprise the Hessians by a sudden attack, and
then, if possible, strike another effective blow. He
knew that on the morning succeeding Christmas,
the enemy would be less vigilant and less prepared
to resist a spirited attack. ’

With two thousand ﬁve hundred of his best men,
Washington began recrossing the river at a point
about eight miles above Trenton. It was a severe
task,-for the river was full of tumultuous masses

‘of ice, which rolled and tumbled over each other

and threatened to overwhelm any boat that left the
shore. It was bitterly cold and snowing hard.

Epoc/zs 232 Amen/z'ccm Hzktory. ,73

Washington intended that another division
should cross opposite Trenton and a third further
down near Bristol, but the width of the stream, and
the enormous quantity of ice prevented. Neither
succeded and the whole work was left to the com-
mander-in-chief.

Washington expected also to place his force on T

the New Jersey shore by midnight, so as to reach
Trenton before daybreak, but this was impossible,

A and the night was well gone when his two thou-

and ﬁve hundred men stood on the other bank.
The march began at four o’clock, but it was still
dark, with the sleet driving like ﬁne shot against
the ragged forms and set faces.

It was while the patriots were crossing the Dela-
ware that some Tory saw them, and read their
purpose. Mounting his horse, he dashed to Tren-
ton and to the door of Abraham Hunt’s house,
where he knew the Hessian colonel made his head-
quarters. He wrote on a slip of paper what he
had learned, and sent it by the servant to Rall and
he, as already related, slipped it into his pocket
and forgot all about it.

Shortly after daybreak, Greene’s advance guard,
under Captain William Washington, a cousin of
the commander-in-chief, reached the Hessian out-
posts at the upper end of the town. Firing upon

’ the patriots, they turned and ran, their lieutenant

falling in the road mortally wounded, as the
Americans rushed over him in pursuit of the foe.
Among those who thus pursued the Hessians, was
young Lieutenant James Monroe, afterwards Presi-
dent of the United States.

The pickets being driven in, Greene entered at
the upper end of the town, near the spot where the
present monument stands. Just then, ﬁring from
the direction of the river showed that Sullivan,
who had taken a detatchment in another way, had
arrived and was pressing the attack in that quarter.
Thus the Hessians were caught between two ﬁres.

Colonel Rall, although hardly recovered from his
debauch of the night before, knew what the ﬁring
meant. He dashed into the street and strove to
rally his men. Several pieces of artillery were
brought up, but while trying to train them against
the Americans, the latter charged upon and cap-
tured them. Lieutenant Monroe was one of the
leaders in this exploit. Washington directed the
ﬁre of six pieces down one of the main streets at the
Hessians who were forming and dispersed them.
About this time Rall, who, was still bravely trying
to rally his men, was struck by a bullet and mortally
wounded.

The fall of their leader and the suddeness of the
attack threw the Hessians into a panic. A num-
ber made a break in the direction of Princeton, but

they surrendered. Others managed to run across

76 Epocﬁs 2'72 A merzkaaz Hzktory.

They were the only ones who were thus fortunate,

' and the rest seing all hope ended, threw down their

arms. —
Colonel Rall, supported by two sergeants and
suﬁering great pain, was conducted to where
Washington sat on his horse and handed his sword
to him. Washington expressed his sorrow for him,
and, in answer to Rall’s request that he would
treat his soldiers with consideration, assured that
officer that he need feel no anxiety from that cause.
Then Rall was carried into a house near at hand
and laid upon a bed. Recalling the note which
had been handed to him the night before, he had it
read to him.

“Had I not forgotten that,” he sadly remarked,
“I would not have been in this condition.”

Washington called upon the dying Hessian
officer after the battle and again expressed his
sympathy for him. Rall thanked him and shortly
afterward died. His body was believed to have
been buried in the grave yard attached to the First
Presbyterian Church, which was founded more
than a half century before. In removing the
graves some years since, a ‘cofhn was found which
was believed to contain the remains of Rall. A
number of the large brass—headed nails were taken
by people as souvenirs, one of which was presented
to the writer.

Epoc/zs 2'72 American Hzktory. 77

The number of Hessians captured was nine
hundred and ﬁfty, besides twenty were killed and
some seventy-ﬁve wounded. In addition, the
Americans secured six ﬁeld-pieces and a large
number of small arms. Of the patriots, two were
killed and four wounded. It is not certain that

the deaths of the two were not due to the cold rather

than to the bullets of the enemy.

Few contests equalled in importance the appar-
ently insigniﬁcant skirmish at Trenton, onthe 26th
of December, 1776, for like the other events re-
corded in these pages, it marked an epoch in our
history. It did that which Washington meant it
should do: it raised the drooping hopes of the
country and inspired anew the patriots struggling
for independence. Much trial, hardship and ﬁght-
ing remained to be met, but never again did the
prospects of the young States become so gloomy,
and never was hope at so low an ebb as‘ just‘ before
the victory at Trenton. -

The army was so cheered by its success that
fourteen hundred New England troops whose
terms were about to expire, re-enlisted and the
Continental army was soon increased to an effect-
ive force of six thousand. Robert Morris, the
great ﬁnancier, who did so much for his country,
raised ﬁfty thousand dollars in gold which he sent
to Washington to pay his soldiers, who were in

sore need of it. The Victory of Princeton followed
within a few weeks. Frederick the Great of
Prussia declared that the achievements of Wash-
ington and his band of patriots during the six
weeks following Christmas, 1 776, were not exceeded
in brilliancy in the military annals of any country.

delphia, Sir John Burgoyne planned a campai.gn
from Canada to Lake Champlain.

His army numbered ten thousand men, iuclud-
ing Hessian and British troops, a corps of artillery
and a large number of Indians. The campaign
involved an advance northward of Howe to Albany,
where he was to meet Burgoyne. When this was
accomplished, "New England would be entirely cut
off from the rest of the States.

The American garrison at Fort Ticonderoga
retreated before the formidable advance. Burgoyne
reached Fort Edward on the 30th of July, where-
upon General Schuyler with his small patriot force,
crossed the Hudson and posted himself at

_ Saratoga.

The campaign which promised so well for 1;he
British arms had not been pressed long when
Burgoyne awoke to several alarming facts. Most of
his Indians deserted, though that gave him little
concern, since they were of slight value in regular
warfare, but, being so far from his base of
supplies, with the distance increasingevery day,
the British commander found his provisions
running short, and with little prospect of
obtaining more. The patriots were ﬂocking
from all directions, and, though they were not
strong enough to give him battle, they were strong
and alert enough to cut off the foraging parties

Epoc/zs 2'72 Amerztavz Hzktory. A 8l

which he sent out and to prevent him obtaining
indispensable supplies.

It often happened that those detachments came
back at the end of a few hours, empty-handed and
with a loss of a number that had been picked off by
the unerring American sharpshooters.

Schuyler had less than one-half as many men as
Burgoyne, and retreated through Skeensboro
toward Albany, doing so slowly, burning the
bridges behind him, felling trees and throwing
every possible obstacle in the path of his pursuers.
Finally he took position on a number of islands at
the junction of the Mohawk and the Hudson, and
waited for reinforcements. Burgoyne dared not

attack him, but again devoted his energies to ,

gathering sorely-needed supplies. He sent a
thousand Hessians under the command of Colonel
Baum to Bennington, where General John Stark
was gathering recruits for the northern army.
Although Stark had but half as many men as the
enemy he made instant preparations to attack
them. Addressing his soldiers, he said: “There
they are, boys! We must beat them to-day, or
this night Mollie Stark is a widow!”

And then the patriots charged the Hessians with
such impetuosity that they were routed “horse,
foot and dragoons.” Burgoyne was so anxious for
the success of the ﬁrst detachment, that he sent a

second to its support. Thus strengthened, the
Hessians again attacked; but it so happened that
Stark was also reinforced and he delivered as
crushing a defeat as before.

The two armies confronted each other for some
time. Burgoyne was steadily growing weaker,
with his provisions running low, while the
Americans as steadily increased in number, had
plenty of supplies and were in buoyant spirits.
The expected aid from New York did not come to
Burgoyne and he saw that his situation was be-
coming 111ore desperate every day and indeed every
houn

Burgoyne saw that his only hope was to retreat
to the lakes. To do that, it was necessary to drive
out the Americans who held a strong position
on his left. He made the attempt, but was defeated
with the loss of several hundred men and nine
pieces of artillery. General Gates pressed his
advantage. Fifteen hundred men were posted on
Bemis Heights, as many more at a fort higher up,
and a'still larger force shut of retreat in the
direction of Fort Edwards.

Burgoyne was virtually surrounded. His forces
decreased, his provisions were nearly gone, while
reinforcements constantly joined the Americans.
His position had become. hopeless, since no word
reached him from Clinton who was to advance

INTRODUCTION.

N OTHING can be more inspiring to the youthful mind,

nor a greater incentive to patriotism, than a study of
our historical epochs, or those events which had a decisive
and far-reaching effect upon the development of the nation.

It is the aim of this volume to set forth in simple lan-
guage the leading events in American history. Thus, the
founding of Jamestown, in 1607, and of Plymouth, in 1620,
were the germs of the thirteen colonies, and of the young
Nation that sprang from them, The battle of Quebec was
one of the great battles of the world, since it decided who
were to be the masters of a continent. The battle of Lex-
ington, where was ﬁred the shot “heard round the world,”
was the signal for the opening of the Revolution. The
Declaration of Independence was the irrevocable step which
severed the colonies from the mother country. The victory
at Trenton swept aside the clouds of despair and let through
the sunburst of hope. The victory at Saratoga gave France
the excuse for which she was waiting to make common
cause with us. And the triumph at Yorktown secured the
independence of the United States.

The framing and adoption of the Constitution ushered in
the reign of peace, of stability, and of national existence;

from New York to his help. He called acouncil
of war, which agreed to enter into negotiations
with Gates for surrender.

The surrender took place October 17th, 1777.
Not quite six thousand ofﬁcers and soldiers became
prisoners of war, including a ﬁne train of brass
artillery, numbering forty-two pieces, ﬁve thousand
muskets and an immense quantity of ammunition
and stores. Among the prisoners were six
members of the British Parliament, who had come
across the ocean to see Burgoyne end the war
and subdue the patriots struggling for inde-
pendence.

It is pleasant to record that the Americans
treated their prisoners with great consideration.
They divided their rations with the famishing
troops, and all mingled like brothers, discussing
the incidents of the campaign, and each army con-
ceding that the other was composed of good and
brave fellows.

A feeling of consternation spread through
England, when the news reached that country.
No one seemed to have doubted the overwhelming
success of the grand campaign, and when they
were looking for word to that effect, they learned
that the commander, his ofﬁcers and all his troops
had become prisoners of war. The resentment
against Burgoyne was so intense that when he re-

E17505/zs 2'72 Ame:/z'ca72 Hzklory. '85

turned home, King George refused to see him, and
even denied_ him a court martial. Several years
passed before his country admitted that he had
done all that was possible and was in no way
blamable for the disaster.

The joy among the States was correspondingly
great. There had been few successes and plenty
of defeats for the American army in other quarters.
The news, therefore, of the capture of one
of the ﬁnest armies England had sent
to conquer America raised the spirits of

the patriots everywhere and nerved them to .

more resolute efforts to conquer in‘ their war for
freedom. ,

But this was not all. The results of this great
victory were far reaching and decisive. It has
been shown that England and France had been
rivals for centuries. Less than twenty years be-
fore, England, with the help of her colonies
had driven France from American soil. That
country hated England, and, when the colonies
declared their independence and the Revolution
began, the king of France was almost as anxious
as ourselves that we should succeed. He gave us
a great deal of secret help, but he wished to do so
openly. We had sent several of our ablest men to
the court of France to urge Louis XVI. to take
this step. He felt, however, that he must wait

86 Epoc/zs 2'72 Ame7/z'ca7z Hzktory.

until we gained some marked success, for such action
on his part meant a war with England.

The capture of Burgoyne and his army gave
the king the excuse he Wanted. He decided to
hesitate no longer. It should be added that much
of the credit for this important step belonged to
Benjamin Franklin, the famous philosopher, who,
accompanied by Arthur Lee, oined Silas Deane in
Paris. Franklin was one of the greatest of
Americans and his fame had reached Europe long
before. He was welcomed to the gay court by the
fashionable ladies and gentlemen. Very diﬁerent
from those butterﬂies of fashion, Franklin was dress-
ed in plain,neat clothing, but he was genial, witty and
with ten times the brain of any whom he encountered.

When the great man was young, he had been a
hard student and thought he knew all about the
French language; but it was almost impossible
for him to understand the chatter around him.
The beautiful ladies welcomed him and no gay
cavalier attracted one-half the pleased attention
that he did. He did his best to speak the
language and the light-hearted courtiers and
ladies pretended to understand him, while he tried
to give the impression that he knew everything
said to him, when really he could not catch the
meaning of but little of what was said.

One of the leading gentlemen once rose to make

Epocks in /1merz'am Hzkiory. 87

a speech. Franklin thought the safest course
for him was to take his cue from the others and
applaud when they did. So when they clapped
their hands, he did the same, nodded his head and

' looked as delighted as they. Some time later, he

learned to his dismay, that all the sentences which
he had applauded were expressions of praise of
himself.

Franklin, as has been said, was witty and im-
mensely popular, but he was also one of the wisest
and most patriotic of Americans. Although he
could chat and est and get the best of any of his
friends in light conversation, he did not forget
that he had been sent to the French court on
serious business. He saw when the news of Bur-
goyne’s surrender reached that country that his
golden opportunity had come. His arguments
with the king were so shrewd and tactful that the
monarch was completely won over. He declared
that he was ready to form a treaty of alliance with
the United States and such a treaty was concluded
in the month of February, 1778.

In this treaty, France acknowledged the
independence of the United States and agreed to
make common cause with our country. Each was
bound not to treat with Great Britain for peace
without the consent of the other. Franklin drew
up the treaty, which was not only of the highest

88 E1505/25 2'72 Ame7*z'am Hzktory.

importance, but was the ﬁrst made between the
United States and a foreign nation.

News of the making of the treaty reached this
country in April, and Congress ratiﬁed it a few
weeks’ later. England was profoundly stirred, and
tried hard to conciliate the Americans. She offer-
ed to give them every thing they had demanded,
but they would not agree since she withheld the
one priceless boon-independence.

VIII.

THE CROWNING VICTORY AT YORKTOWN.

 .  E have learned in the preced-
 ing chapter of the important
step taken by France to help

our forefathers in their
struggle for independence. That
country agreed to send four thou-
sand men and sixteen war vessels
to this country, to aid in the con-
ﬂict against Great Britain, which
immediately declared war against
France. The reigning families in
France and Spain were related, and,
in 1779, Spain united with France,
the two being oined the following
year by Holland. Thus, it may
be said, the capture of Burgoyne
not only secured us a ﬂeet and army, but compelled
England to ﬁght three other nations besides ours.
It must be added, however, that the French force
sent over by France gave very little help for a con-
siderable time. After their ﬂeet made ready to
ﬁght the English one off Newport, Rhode Island, it
was scattered by a storm and then sailed for the

90 Epac/zs in Amerzkan Hzkiory.

West Indies, where there were French colonies.
Whenever Washington had work for those ships
to do, their commander felt it to be his duty to go
to the VVest Indies and he went.

Toward the close of the war, however, France
proved herself the friend in need. An army of six
thousand men under the command of Rochambeau,
was landed at Newport in the summer of 1780, and,
some time later, marched to Washington’s camp near
Peekskill and Morristown, andunited with his forces.
This gave him a powerful army, and he made ready
to strike the most decisive blow of the whole war.

Sir Henry Clinton, with a large force of the
enemy, occupied New York. He was in a constant
state of alarm, for he could not make out what
Washington meant to do. He believed he intended
to attack him in New York, and he busied himself
in making every preparation for defense. Wash-
ington did all he could to keep up this belief on the
part of the British commander, but he had far dif-
ferent plans in mind.

He had learned from a French frigate, which
arrived in August, that a French ﬂeet and army
would soon reach Chesapeake Bay. Cornwallis,
who was one of the best of the British generals, had
been busy in the South and was in that section with

p the leading British army. Washington’s plan was

to hurry thither, and with the help of the French

Epoc/zs 2'7/z Ameriam Hzktory. 91

ﬂeet, cut off and capture Cornwallis before the
British ﬂeet could reach the Chesapeake.

On the 19th of August, the allied army before
New York prepared to move. Clinton was certain
he was to be attacked, but, instead of advancing
against that city, the whole force faced southward
and began the eventful march to Virginia.

The Hudson was crossed three days later, and the
armies encamped at Haverstraw. A guard was left at
Peekskill, but the patriot army, with high hopes, was
sweeping southward. They were welcomed in
Philadelphia by the booming of cannon, and the
shouts of the people, who crowded the sidewalks, the
doors and windows, and wished the brave fellows
Godspeed in the grand campaign that had opened.

Yorkton is on the southern bank of York River,
with Gloucester directly opposite on the northern
shore. Cornwallis was engaged in fortifying both
points. He disliked the positions, but he carried
out the orders of his superior officer Clinton in New
York,whom also he disliked, for Cornwallis had good
reason for thinking Clinton had treated him unjustly.

Cornwallis was with his main army at Yorktown,
while the famous cavalry leader Tarleton had six
hundred or more men at Gloucester. Cornwallis
wrought hard to make his defenses eﬂective, for his
force was much weaker than the Americans and
French that were closing in upon him.

92 Epoc/zs 2'72 Amerzkan Hzktory.

Clinton had been apprised of the perilous situa-
tion of Cornwallis, who told his superior ofﬁcer that
unless he sent him‘ help very soon, he must be
prepared to hear the worst. Batteries were erected,
the channel of the river was blocked by sunken
vessels and everything possible was done to make
the defenses so strong that Cornwallis could hold
out until the arrival of the promised aid from
Clinton.

The allied armies encamped near Williamsburg,
on the 25th of September, and the next day took
their respective positions. The Americans formed
the right wing and occupied the east side of Beaver
Dam Creek, while the French, forming the left
wing, were posted on the other side. Cornwallis
withdrew from his outworks into the town, the
abandoned works being seized by detachments of
French and American troops. At the close of day
on the 28th, the allied forces were within two miles
of Yorktown and a French force crossed over to
watch the enemy at Gloucester Point. Five days
later, all communication of Gloucester with the
surrounding country was cut off. '

The allies worked without cessation. Steadily
and surely they pushed their advantage. It
may be said that they had their grip upon the
throat of the enemy and would not let go until he
was strangled.

The situation of Cornwallis soon became desper-
ate. His only hope was in receiving reinforce-
ments, but his longing gaze toward the sea showed
no sign of the ships that Clinton was to send to his
assistance. Forage could not be obtained for the
horses, and many were shot and tumbled into the
river. An epidemic placed more than a third of
his men in the hospital. By the 16th of October, all
the guns belonging to Cornwallis were dismounted
and his shells expended. He would have been justi-
fied in surrendering, but before doing so, he resolved
upon a last attempt to save himself and command.

His plan was to leave his sick, wounded and his
baggage, cross the river in the darkness, disperse
the French force there and then hurry through
Pennsylvania and New Jersey to New York. He
began the movement and a part of his army was
taken across, but a storm carried many of the boats
down the stream. It took a long time to recover
them and when daylight broke, Cornwallis brought
back the troops that had crossed to Gloucester. He
made up his mind that there was no hope, and
notiﬁed Washington that he was ready to enter
into negotiations for surrender. The terms were
agreed to and signed on the 18th.

The surrender of Cornwallis took place on the
afternoon of October 19th, 1781. At two o’clock,
the British troops marched out of Yorktown, with
