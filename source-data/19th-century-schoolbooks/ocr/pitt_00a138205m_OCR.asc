TWENIIEIH CENTURY LETTER WRITER.

INTRODUCTION.

 

'A‘ FEW WORDS ON GENERAL LETTER WRITING FOR THE
READER.

I It is possible that nothing is more expressive of the
World’s progress to-day than a comparison of the various
“LETTER WRITERS” which have appeared from year to
year. Gradually, and by almost imperceptible stages, the
stilted phrases of the chivalrous age, the elaborate, ﬂow-
ery rhetoric of the leisure hour and the stereotyped, par-
rot—like expressions of customary usage have given place
to spontaneous, natural and original styles, which ex-
press courteously, but tersely, the writer’s sentiments.

To state one’s desires in as few words as possible——to
couch them in polite, grammatical language—to write
them legibly with all due regard for courteousness with-
out “toadyism,” respect without effusiveness, is the pres-
ent aim of the sensible correspondent, whether he be in

business or in social life-—-—whether he be friend, relative

or lover.

8 SheIdon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer.

It is to aid in this endeavor that the TWENTIETH CEN-
TURY LETTER WRITER has been offered to the public.
This little book follows no guide except that of intelli-
gent conception of the needs and customs of the present,
with, perhaps, a prophetic insight into the requirements
of the future.

The First Need in CoRREcT LETTER WRITING is a
knowledge of the proper formation of letters, Spelling,
Pnnctnation and the C 0-nstrnction of Sentences.

INK and PAPER are a matter of individual taste, but it
is always well to choose a clear, decided color in both, so
as to make the handwriting as neat and legible as possible.

W ltite Paper can always be relied upon. to be correct,
and should be used exclusively in Business Correspond-
ence.

Social, Friendly or l/I/iferctionate letters should never be
Wri-tten upon gpa-per bearing the letter-head of a business
house, but always upon note paper of a good tint and
quality.

Plain handwriting is not merely an accomplishment, but
a duty which we owe to ourselves as well as to others,
and it is something that all can attain with patience and
perseverance.

In Social Letters the Address of the Writer may be
written at the top of the page, and the date at the bottom,
if desired. This is optional with the taste of the writer.

The CONCLUSION of your letter should be respectful, but
by no means servile, like the words “Your humble ser-

‘ vant,” which smacks of “toadyism,” or, at least, insin-

Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. 9
cerity. Never use foreign words in any letters except to
very old friends, and then onlywhen you are sure that
they are familiar with the language.

ABBREVIATIONS should never be used in Social Letters;
they are permissible, however, in Business Communica-
tions, where a ‘mutual understanding of mercantile terms
exists.  
A ARITHMETICAL FIGURES should not be utilized in letter’
writing unless they follow the written word and are in-
closed in parenthesis. i i

Long words are objectionable in correspondence of

whatsoever nature; always be as natural in your style of ,4

Writing as you are in speaking,

When you make use of a quotation, be sure that it is
made correctly, and never fail to enclose it in quotation
marks. V-

Avoid repetition and try not to be tedious. Say what
you have to say as interestingly as possible. Neverpu-t
anything upon paper that you do not know to be ab-so-
lutely true, and be careful to say nothing that could injure
anyone, as letters frequently go astray or fall into the
hands of unscrupulous persons,.Who might use them to
make trouble. i

Never write a letter in pencil if pen and ink can be
procured. Such an act implies indifferent regard for
the one to whom you are writing.

The reply to a letter should embrace all questions asked,
and it is a proof of both courtesy and carefulness to re-

spond to each in regular order.

IO Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter  Writer.

It is well to keep copies of all important comrnunicae
tions, and, knowing that others are quite liable to do the
same, be extremely cautious as to the contents of all
letters.

Always read an important letter over twice before
answering it, and always read your answer over before
mailing. If possible, keep such a letter for twenty—four
hours before mailing it, unless this would cause serious
delay to the recipient, and be sure that it expresses clearly
the sentiments you desire to convey.

POSITION IN WRITING.

The POSITION which you assume in writing is very im-
portant. To» bend or contract the body is both inelegant
and injurious. Sit erect and let your paper be before
you, slightly to the right. Hold your pen ﬁrmly, but
easily, without cramping the ﬁngers. T

Allow the light to fall upon your paper over the left
shoulder, if possible.

Do not touch the pen itself with the ﬁngers, but allow
the ball of the index ﬁnger to rest lightly about half .ar1
inch from the point of insertion of the pen into the holder.

PE'NMANSI-IIP.

PENMANSHIP is an index to character, therefore it is
well to write as plainly and gracefully as possible, observ-
ing eachdetail in the formation of both letters and words.

To ﬂourish extensively indicates egotism, and it is also I

confusing to the eye of the reader. A neat, plain chirog-

Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. 11

raphy denotes consideration for others, and is by far the
safest, as it leaves no room for guesswork as to what

a was intended by the writer.

If the gift of plain writing has been denied you, it will
be well to adopt some particular style and copy it patiently
until it has been cultivated.

Copy—Books showing specimens of excellent handwrit-
ing are to be found in all book stores where school supu

' plies are sold, and it is “never too late to mend,” espe-

cially in this important direction.

SPELLING.

CORRECT SPELLING is one of the most important details  

in letter writing. By reading over a letter after it is
Written, such errors are easily noticed, but if any doubt
arises it is well to refer to a dictionary in order to rectify
what may be an error and to prevent its recurrence. ;

The following simple rules will be of beneﬁt:

All words of one syllable, ending in l, with a single
vowel before it, have ll at their close, as mill, sill.

‘All words of one syllable ending in l, with a double
vowel before it, have only one l at the close, as mail, sail.

Several words like distill and fulfill retain the ll of their
primitives. Also derivatives of dull, skill, will, etc., retain
the ll when the accent falls upon the ﬁrst syllable, as dull-
ness, skillful, willful.

Words of more than one syllable ending in l have only

1 one l at the close, as delightful, faithful, unless the accent

fall upon the last syllable, as in befall.

I2 SheIclon’s Twentieth Century l.etter Writer.

Words ending in l double that letter in the termina-
tion ly.

Participles ending in mg, from verbs ending in e, lose
the final e, as have, having; make, making, etc.; but
verbs ending in ee, retain both, as see, seeing. The Word
dye, to color, however retains the e before mg. All ad-
verbs in Zy and nouns ending. in ment retain the e ﬁnal of
the primitives, as brave, bravely; reﬁne, reﬁnement; ex-
cept words ending in dge, as acknowledge, acknowledg-
ment. Words ending in e drop; that letter before the ter-
mination able, as in move, movable; unless ending in ce
or ge, when it is retained, as in change, changeable, etc.
Words of one syllable, ending in a consonant with a single
vowel before it, double that consonant in derivatives, as
ship, slazpgﬁlng, etc.

But if ending in a consonant with a double vowel be-
fore it, they do not double the consonant in derivatives,
astroop, trooper, etc. Words of more than one syllable,
ending in a consonant preceded by a single vowel, and
accented on the last syllable, double the consonant in
derivatives, as commit, commlllecl. The words chagrin,

chagrined, are an exception.

Nouns ending in y, preceded by a vowel, form their

plural by adding 5, as money, moneys; but if y is pre-

ceded by a consonant, it is changed to ies in the plural,
as bonnty, bonnties.

Compound words whose primitives end in 3!, change 3!
into l, as beanty, beantlfnl, etc.

Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. 13

CONTRACTION OF WORDS.

The character 65: called “short cmd,” is used only in
the titles of ﬁrms, as, M iller 59* May, or Miles 57' C 0.

Other contractions, as d07/ft, for do not, cam? for can-
not, are objectionable. The symbol éérc. may be used in-
stead of the words et cetera, as it has become almost a
universal custom, and in certain things “custom makes
law” for all of us.

PUNCTUATION.

Next to legible handwriting in importance comes cor-
rect Punctuation. Without the accurate placing of these
little marks the most profound sentiment can be made to
read foolishly and the simplest expression appears dis-
torted.

The principal points, and rules for their use, are as
follows: i

The COMMA (,) is used Wh€I‘€V€1'- a triﬂing pause
would be made, if you were speaking. This point marks
the smallest division of a sentence. _ >

The SEMICOLON ( ;) marks a longer and more distinct
pause than a comma, and is used to divide a compound
sentence.

The CoLoN (:) marks a pause greater than a semi-
colon and less than a period. It is used after a sentence
complete in itself, but follovved, without a conjunction, by
some remark, inference or explanation.

The PERIOD (.) is the point that marks the end of a
complete sentence. It should be used after every ab-

T tbrevi«ation.

14 Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer.

—.__...a

The DASH (—-—) is used to denote a sudden stop, an
abrupt change of thought, a signiﬁcant pause, or to add
effect to other points.

The INTERROGATIONI ( P) must be placed after every
question.

The EXCLAMATION ( !) is used after every expression
or sentence that denotes strong emotion.

The PARENTHESIS ( ) is used to enclose a word or
sentence inserted by way of comment or explanation, and
which is independent of and not necessarily connected
with the rest of the sentence.

The BRACKETS [ ] are used to enclose a reference.

The QUOTATION MARKS (“”) are used to enclose
borrowed or quoted expressions. ,

The APOSTROPHE (’) is used to denote that a word is
Contracted and is also the point used to signify the pos-
sessive case.

CAPITALS.

The first word of every sentence should begin with a
capital.

All proper names, titles, names and attributes of the
Deity, names of States, towns and villages, rivers, lakes,
mountains, etc., should begin with capitals.

The pronoun “I” and the exclamation “O,” or “Oh,”
should begin with a capital.

The titles of books and their chapter heads, also the
words “Index” and “Introduction” or “Preface” should
begin with capitals.

SheIdon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. 15

The names of the seasons, months, days of the Week
and all names of railroads, stearnboats, yachts, clubs, col-
leges, etc., should begin with capitals.

The points of the compass, as, North, South, East and
West, a.nd their compounds and abbreviations, as North-
east, Southwest, begin vvith capitals, when used as nouns.

Begin all adjectives formed from the names of places
or points of the compass, as “an Englishman,” “a
Northern woman,” with a capital.

Begin every line of poetry and all direct quotations
with a capital.

The name of an historical event, as the French Revolu-
tion, should begin With capitals. 3

All addresses, as Dear Sir, or Dear Madam, and all

conclusions, as Yours truly, or Yours sincerely, should,

begin with capitals,

Never place a capital in the middle of a sentence except
in accordance with these foregoing rules.

Do not “flourish” a. capital so that it becomes over-
conspicuous, but make each and every one proportionate
to the size of the smaller letters.

STYLE.
NATURAL language and originality of sentiment are all
that is required in good letter Writing.
Express yourself simply and endeavor to put yourself in
sympathy with the one to whom you are Writing, so that

the message contained in your letter will breathe harmony,

rather than discord to the soul of the reader.

16 Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer.

Be as decided and impressive as necessity demands, but
always imbue your message with the essence of courtesy.

Discretion in the mention of private or family matters
should always be observed, and satire or humor should
only be indulged in when one is sure of the sense of ap
preciation of the recipient.

Use joyous, sprightly terms in letters of congratula-
tion; tender and sympathetic expressions in letters of
condolence, and hopeful, cheering Words in communicat—
ing to those who are depressed or unhappy.

When you have acquired a pleasing style, and one that
is consistent with your temperament and habits, do not at-
tempt to alter it for any reason whatever.

Remember that a letter written in an artiﬁcial style
comes to your friend like a strange guest rather than as a
communication from a loved one.

Similes should be avoided in letter Writing unless one
is master of the art; and quotations should not be used too
freely, as they detract from the originality of the letter.

Never put a word upon paper that is not ﬁt for the
whole world to see ; but let every letter that passes from
your hands reflect upon you both courtesy and credit.

GRAMMAR.

GRAMMATICAL construction of sentences is essential in

every form of letter writing, not merely for the sake of
euphonyi and elegance, but for accuracy of statement.

A knowledge of the use of nouns, pronouns and ad-
jectives should be acquired ﬁrst, then add to» this, num-

ber and tense, and there will be little difficulty in forming
a sentence correctly.

Any standard grammar will teach you this, and with-
out it no writer, no matter ho-vv his thoughts may soar,
need ever hope to attain even mediocrity in composition.

A few simple rules of grammar are here given:

The plural pronoun those has two forrms, viz., those
and them, the ﬁrst of which represents the subject that
acts, and the latter the object that is acted npon.

The word who expresses the agent that acts; the word
whom is used to designate the person acted npon. Which
may be used before the names of persons but not after.

Be careful not to combine a negative with an Cl-7%7’1/I/LC!-152.718
conjunction, as “N either Tom or his brother.” This
should be written “N either Tom nor his brother.” Also
avoid a double negative, as “VVe have not no meat.”
This should read, “We have no meat.”

hen I is used in conjunction with another personal
pronoun, always mention yourself last, as “H e and I,”
“.3 he and I .” '

PARAGRAPHS.

A PARAGRAPH is simply the separation, by periods, of
irrelevant or completed sentences.

Each paragraph should contain the complete relation of
an incident or a statement independent of what imme-
diately follows or precedes. Turn the pages of any well-
written book and glance at the paragraphing if you are
in need of instruction.

Always begin a paragraph on a separate line from the

18 Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer.

one preceding it, and do not forget to endit with a period.
or other appropriate mark.
TITLES.
TITLES of respect and courtesy, as Mr., Miss, Madam
or Messrs. are used in all forms of correspondence, and

are only omitted when some professional or official title is

utilized.

The Society of Friends is the only exception" to this rule.
In addressing one of their number the names only are
used. W

Master may be used when addressing young boys, and
M mes. denotes the plural for ladies.

Esquire may follow a name with perfect propriety, but
is most appropriately app-lied to men of some prominence
in society.

Two titles may be employed in some instances, as Rev.

M r., M rs. Dr., M rs. Secretary, etc.

Also two or mo-re professional titles may be annexed to
one name, provided one does not include or pre-suppose
the other, as Prof. Tracy C. Green, A. M., Rev. Dr., Rev.
John Carr, D. D., LL. Dz, Dr. Charles Warren, U. S. N.

The title Rev. should never be used immediately before
the surname. Either the Christian name should be given
or some other title should intervene, as The Rev. form-
thcm Edwards, or The Rev. Mr. Edwards.

When two or more titles follow a name they should be
Written in the order in which they were conferred.

When titles o-r degrees applicable to the same person are
similar in kind, only the most honorable is used.

She1don’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. 19

When they differ in kind, and but one is given, the
most honorable is utilized; when all are given, they are
placed in the order of their honor or precedence.

CONSTRUCTION OF A LETTER.

The HEADING of a letter consists of the Place and Date,
indicating when and where the letter was written, which
should be written clearly and in full at the top of the
page, except in some special forms of social, business and
military letters, where it is written at the bottom. V

The INTRODUCTION consists of the NAME or TITLE of
the person written to, and his DIRECTIONS, together with
the complimentary greeting.

Always annex the title of Miss, M12, Mrs. or Esquire as
a matter of courtesy, unless the individual addressed has
some special title, as Captain, Doctor, Admiral, etc.

The DIRECTIONS comprise the name of town and State,
and, if desired, the county may be added, or, if the person

i addressed lives in the city, the street and number, as well

as the city and State, must be added.

The COMPLIMENTARY GREETING varies according to
the acquaintance and relationship between the writer and
the person addressed, and is courteous or affectionate as
suits the degree of familiarity.

The common form, which is proper for both business
and social letters, is Dear Madam, Dear Sir, or Dear
M /iss. To these may be added the surname, or, in cases
of closer intimacy, the wo-rd Dear, with the Christian

’ name affixed, as Dear Anna, or My dear Amara». c Tn the

2o Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer.

ﬁ_—a

latter case, where close intimacy exists, the address may
be placed at the end of the letter rather than at the in-
troduction.

The parts of the introductory address should be sepa-
rated by a comma, and a period placed after each ab-
breviation, and at the end of the address.

The SALUTATION OR COMPLIMENTARY GREETING
should be one line above the beginning of the letter and
should be written from the left—hand margin of the paper.
It should be followed by a comma and a dash.

The BODY of the letter is the communication itself, or
all that is contained between the introductionand con-
clusion. J "

It is proper to leave a blank margin at the left of the
paper, but this rule is not absolute.

The CONCLUSION consists in the words of courtesy, re-
spect or affection at the close of the letter, together with
the signature. i

As with the Complimentary Greeting, these concluding
words vary according to the degree of friendship and
familiarity between writer and recipient.

A few common forms are “Yours respectfully,” “Yours

3

truly,’ or “Yours sincerely,” each of which may be em-
phasized by the addition of the word “very.”

There are many other forms which may be prompted
by the writer’s originality, and which are supposed to
express the honest sentiments of the writer rather than
the empty formality of usage or custom.

The SIGNATURE should be written in full, and if the

She1don’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. 21

letter is o-f importance the address should be added, if it
does not appear in the H eading of the letter. J
In an oﬁfcial letter the writer’s designation is written

after or below his name and forms a part of his signa-W "

ture, as: p
David A. Hall,
Corresponding Secretary.

The CoNcLUsIoN, or COMPLIMENTARY CLOSE, should
begin on the line below the end of the letter, the SIGNA-
TURE to follow.

The SUPERSCRIPTION, or ADDRESS, should be written
with especial care, and the various parts separated by a
comma. All abbreviations should be followed by a
period.

Begin the address at the left of the envelope-, taking
care that it leaves room for the stamp to be affixed in
the upper right—hand corner, and that it is in a position
not to be defaced by the postmark. The following

models for SUPERSCRIPTION embrace the most common
forms:

When a letter of INTRODUCTION is inclosed, leave the
envelope unsealed, and write the name of the person in.-
troduced in the lower left-hand corner, thus:

Messrs. Burt <9‘ Bostwz'c*k,
51 East 23d Street,

If a letter is sent by a friend, the name of the Bearer
is also written in the lower left—hand corner, as:

To insure the return of an undelivered letter, either
use an envelope bearing a CARD in the upper left—hand
corner, or write your address neatly and in full, thus:

POSTSCRIPTS.

Do not add a Postscript unless something of impor-
tance has been left out of the body of your letter and you
have no time to rewrite it, and even then it is advisable

T to use a sep-arate piece of paper for the forgotten item and

sign it exactly as you have signed the letter.

The Postscript is claimed as the prerogative of women,
and it has been said that no woman ever writes a letter
without one.

In social letters such a triﬂing matter may pass unno-
ticed, bu-t it is a sign o-f a good letter writer to have no
need of the postscript.

POSTAL CARDS should never be used for important com-
munications or messages of private import. The address
is all that is allowed upon the face of the card.

VV rite your address, with date, at the head of the com-

munication, the same as in writing. a letter.

The Postal Department makes no provision for its re-
turn in case of non-delivery at the place of destination.

ENVELOPES should always match the style, quality and
color of the paper used, and should be of a size to accom-
modate the proper folding.

Be careful in fastening the envelope to see that it holds.

When a number are to be sealed, it is well to use a
camel’s-hair brush, as mucilage is distasteful, and acci-

dents, as the sharp edge of the paper cutting the tongue,

are both painful and serious.

26 She1don’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer.

STAMPS.

Place your STAMP on the upper right-hand corner of
the envelope.

Put it right side up and do no-t wet it too much. Be
sure that it adheres properly before mailing the letter.

When you have many stamps to affix, it is well to
moisten them with a brush or apply the tongue to the en-
velope rather than to the bad—tasting mucilage.

When writing for information or on business which
concerns only your own interests, inclose a stamped en-
velope with your address upon it, as you have no right to
put the recipient to expense or trouble.

Never use two one—cent stamps in~place of one two if
you can avoid it. The fewer stamps upon an envelope
or parcel the better.

SOCIAL LETTERS.

Letters of a purely friendly or affectionate nature
embrace the family, the casual acquaintance, the letter
of condolence, congratulations, acceptance or rejection of
an invitation, and the love letter.

These letters have a relative connection, yet each must
represent a style peculiar to itself and be regulated by the
existing degree of regard, affection, courtesy and duty.
In each of these letters there is opportunity for beauty
and grace of style, together with naturalness and origi-

i nality.

To be sympathetic, sincere and entertaining is the aim
of the good letter writer, and herein lies all the charm
and elegance of the art of writing.

To demonstrate these sentiments by means of pen and
paper one must avoid all “stereotyped” and stilted lan-
guage, using only simple, graceful terms which must
appeal to the heart of the reader.

Express your thoughts in pleasing language, no matter
how often you may be forced to reconstruct a sentence in
order to obtain the euphony you desire.

This may seem drudgery at ﬁrst, but it will be only of
short duration, for when one has culled the choicest ﬁow~
ers of his vocabulary the weaving of the garland will be
but a pleasure.

28 She1don’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer.

Avo-id compound sentences with meaning veiled in ob-
scurity and do not use Words not of the common usage

i in order to show that you are familiar with them. Too

manyADJECTIVES are undesirable. Use them only in de-
scriptions, and even then sparingly.

Above all, assume no airs and graces of speech foreign
to your style of speaking, and express no sentiments be-
cause of their sound when your nature is not in full
accord With them.

The charm in correspondence arises from the degree
of congeniality in tastes—from the individuality. and
spontaneous naturalness of the vvriter——from his sincerity
and genuineness of expression, and his total avoidance of
unpleasant themes and arguments.

FAMILY LETTERS.

 

Communications between the members of a family
should embrace the daily incidents of life; reminiscences
of the past and hopes and expectations for the future.
The penmanship, style and punctuation in these letters
should be attended to carefully, and the message embodied
should be cheerful, interesting and affectionate.

Your neatly written letter reached me last evening, and
I hasten to express to you my pleasure and satisfaction
at the sight of it. i

There is no doubt in my mind that my little girl is

her parents, are giving her, and I am sure that at the
end of the school term she will reflect honor and credit
upon us. R

Be a good girl and obey your teachers. Strive to
acquit yourself well in all the different branches which
you have undertaken, and, above all, my dear little one,

LETTER ERoM A BROTHER TO A SISTER.

My dear Belle :

I have just a minute to spare before going to the lecture
room, and am trying to show my brotherly regard by
writing this long promised letter.

This will prove to you, also, I hope, that as yet no
other fair damsel has come between us, although, can-
didly, dear Belle, I am on the lookout for her and I feel
sure that when she appears you will be ﬁrst to bid her
welcome. It is the same old story here at college, lots
of hard work and lots of fun, and while I am glad and
ambitious to be a “man among men,” I do sometimes
yearn for a glimpse of the old home, with mother and
father‘ and yourself and old Rover and Puss, sitting so
cosily by the open ﬁre.

Did you ever hear me speak of Jack Thurber, my,

Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. i 33
room—mate? He is the nicest fellow I ever knew, upright
as a tree and as" full of fun as a puppy.

He’s the squarest, fairest, brightest youth I ever knew,
and I’d bring him home for vacation if it was not for
one thing-——-that is that I am not quite ready yet to lose
my little sister.

Time’s up now, Belle, so I must say adieu.

Remember me, if you please, to that pretty young lady
whom I met the last time I visited you at the Seminary;
then accept this kiss from your lazy brother, who really
should have re-written this abominable letter.

Lovingly, Ted.

 

THE S1srER’s REPLY.

My dear Brother Ted:

I am always delighted to receive your letters, although,
as you say, you do write “abominal1y.” Miss Spencer
would not allow me to mail a letter with a blot upon its
pages, and so, you see, I am forced to write carefully; but
never mind, Ted, you will cease to blot some day, I am
sure; still I doubt if your letters will be any dearer to
your sister than they are just now with all their blemishes.

You have interested me greatly in your room-mate, but,
believe me, dear brother, it is not from sentiment alone,
although I admit I should like to see him, but I am over-
joyed to know that you have so desirable a companion.
He must be most entertaining.

I have delivered your message to Miss Lee, and oh!

32 Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer.

i_..

Ted, you should have seen her blush! Really, brother
dear, I think you must have made an “impression.”

It will seem strange to think of love and marriage, will
it not? Yet, do you know, I am always thinking of it
“sub—consciously,” and trying to perfect myself in every
study. and accomplishment, so that when my lover does
come he will have reason to be proud of me.

Your pen picture of the old home nearly gave me the
“blues.” You have no idea how I long for vacation!

I am progressing but slowly, I fear, in some of my
studies, but in others I am gaining rapidly and hope to
have a fair average of “marks” when I reach the Spring
examinations.

Do write to me often, Ted, just as often as you can,
and until the other fortunate young lady arrives who is
to win my brother’s best and sweetest love, please try to
think that “sister” is your little sweetheart. With a
dozen kisses to counterbalance the one very large one

which you sent, I am, dear. Ted,

Your loving sister,
Belle.

K FA'rHER’s LETTER TO AN ERRING SON.

My dear John:

I am pained to hear through various sources that you
are developing habits which are both unmanly and dan-
gerous. I do not allow myself to believe the full extent
of these rumors, but, as I am positively aware of some of

Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. 33

your faults, I am obliged to believe that they may not
be greatly exaggerated.

Now, my dear son, I must beg you to reconsider your
mode of living, and think well as to where such habits as
drinking, gambling and betting will lead you.

I am not a “stern father” and I do not expect you to
be perfect, but innocent mischief is one thing and vicious-
ness is another, so for your own sake, your mother’s
sake and for my sake, I implore you to do differently.

Respect yourself, my son, or no one will respect you.

Remember that “A man is known by the company he
keeps,” and “No man can serve two masters”-——God and
Mammon.

It may be that your weaknesses are in great measure
my fault——I have been told so,at any ‘rate, by wel1—mean-

ing neighbors—-—but, if I have erred by my mildness and I

leniency, I feel that I have erred on the right side, as I do
not think it my duty to coerce you into obedience.

Reflect upon your downward course, my dear son, be-
fore it is too late, then call all your manhood to the strug-
gle to conquer your besetting sins, and not only your
earthly but your Heavenly Father will help you.

Let me hear from you at once, as both your mother and
myself are very anxious and uneasy; and in all the vicissi-
tudes of life remember that we love you, John, and that
we desire above all things to see you grow up honest,
manly and respected.
  Y our devoted father,

I Phineas Townsend.

LETTER FROM A YOUNG WORKING WOMAN TO HER
MOTHER. R
My darling Mother:

.Here I am in this big city, surrounded by strangers.
and facing alone the problem of existence.

I know exactly how you are worrying about me,
mother clear, so hasten to tell you just how my changed
condition has affected me.

I am neither depressed, frightened nor dismayed; rather
I am like a bird which has tried and found its wings
strong and reliant and is yearning to fly higher and higher
until the pinnacle of ambition is reached and surmounted.
My position as bookkeeper at Acker & ‘Arlington’s is
humble, to be sure, but it provides me with the necessities
of life, and I can do nicely without the luxuries. My
hours are from eight until ﬁve, with a half hour for
luncheon, but as yet I have not found my duties particu-
larly arduous.

It is such a delight to feel that I am self-supporting!
I am sure you must sympathize with my happiness,
mother, in spite of the fact that you are lonely without me.

I must not linger longer at this sweet task of writing to
you, dear mother, for it is nearly time for me to go to the
Office, but I do hope you are reconciled to my independ-
ence by this time and that you are looking forward, as I
am, to the day when you will be proud of the success of
your loving daughter.

Give my fondest love to papa and the boys, and with
many kisses for yourself, believe me, ever your affec-
tionate, grateful daughter, y Ada.

A BRoTHER’s WARNING TO A SISTER.
My dear Gertrude:

Ihave just heard a rumor that has made my blood boil

with indignation-—not toward you, but toward either the

man or woman who had the audacity to introduce you to
Mr. G. L. C
to a scoundrel! When I heard that you had been riding

 

, a man whom I know to be next door

with this fellow I could hardly believe it, but, upon second
thought, I realized that you had been imposed upon, and
I therefore hasten to write you this letter of warning.

I cannot, as a gentleman, tell you all that I know about
him, but it will be sufficient for my sister, I am sure, to
know that I do not considerhim a ﬁt associate for her;
on the contrary, he is a person who should be shunned
by all respectable people.

When I see you I will tell you what I think you should
know, but until then I trust that you have sufficient con-
ﬁdence in your brother to act upon his judgment, espe-
cially in this matter, unquestioningly.

Please, Gertrude, do me the favor to tell me the name
of the person who introduced himto you, and also state
whether, in your opinion, they were cognizant of his true
character.

Let me hear from you at once, dear Gertrude, as I am
very anxious about you.

Heaven forbid that my letter comes too late to save you,

as I am told that this fellow is possessed of great attract-

iveness for young and innocent maidens, like my darling
sister.
Most affectionately,
Bob.

 

THE SIsTER’s REPLY.
My dear, faithful Bob:
Many thanks for your brotherly warning in regard to
my new acquaintance, Mr. G. L. C ..
This man was introduced to me by Mrs. T

 

, whom

 

you know, and I can assure you that she spoke of him

to me in the highest terms; so you see she, too, has been
misled by some one.

I shall certainly not accept any more invitations from
him, and shall treat him in future with only the degree
of courtesy common among casual acquaintances.

I know my brother well enough to know that he would
never speak falsely of any one, and I only wish that alI
young girls had such true and loyal protectors. I am
having a good time this winter, and only wish that you

. were at home, as it would not be necessary then for me

to accept other escort when I attend our little dances and
parties.

Of course there will be a “Prince” some day to usurp
my brother’s place, but I shall exact that he complies
with my brother’s standard of excellence before I allow
him to come between us, Bob. So here is a kiss of sis~
terly loyalty in payment of the timely letter of warning.

Lovingly
I z Gertrude.

JOLLY LETTER FROM A YOUNG MAN TO HIS CI-IUM.

Dear Old Man:

How goes the world with you?

Have heard nothing from you for so long that I am
fearful of two things, one that you are in love and so,
oblivious of everything and everybody but the object of
your affections, the other that you have met with an
accident which prevents you from writing letters. For
the sake of “auld Zcmg sync,” do tell me which is right,
for in either case I will heartily forgive you:

Of course you will wish to know what I am doing—--
and it is easily told, for I am doing nothing——“out of a.
job,” as the saying goes, and naturally I am slightly out
of conceit with myself and the world in general.

However, as you know, I am like a rubber ball. The  

harder I drop the higher I rebound, so I ﬁgure that, at
that ratio, my next position will be that of President of
the United States or something only a little less high and
mighty. r N

You remember Durant, don’t you, old man? He was
married last month, and, really, you ought to see him!

' The sun is eclipsed by the radiance of his countenance,

and the poetic muse ﬂutters into retirement at his elon-
quent, passionate adulations!

Really, the fellow is “daft” over his beautiful bride, but
it is a form of mental disorder that creates envy in the
breasts of all his bachelor acquaintances.

That is all the news that I know which would be likely

" to interest you, but I am sure that one item like that is

sufficient in one letter, for, were there others, they might

detract from the prominenceof this, and it is my desire

that you shall reflect upon the blissful conditions of Du-
rant, as it may inﬂuence you to “go and do likewise.”
Hoping to hear fromtyou soon, even though it be by
telephone, telegraph or postal card, I remain, always
faithful to past friendship and to yourself,
Philip Ernest Rutgers.

LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION.

 

A letter of INTRODUCTION may be used both in business
and society. It is a medium through which two» or more
persons can be made acquainted with each other. They
should be brief and expressive of the estimation in which
you hold the person introduced, without excessive praise
or commendation.

These letters should not be given to strangers or casual
acquaintances unless this fact is mentioned in the letter,
in order that, should the person introduced prove un-
desirable, the fact will not reflect upon your judgment.
These letters may be delivered in person or sent inclosed
with a card bearing the name and address of the gentle-
man or lady introduced.

No» stamp is needed upon a letter of introduction which
is to be delivered personally, and the envelope should be
left unsealed.

A few models for letters of introduction may assist the
beginner, but there is no rule for the wording of these
epistles other than that which is prompted by friendship
and the requirements of the situation. A

INTRODUCING AN ACTRESS TO A THEATRICAL MANAGER.

Mr. Charles T. Burleigh,
Empire Theatre,
New York City.
Dear Mr. Burleigh:

I takethe liberty of introducing the bearer, Miss Isabel
Ellsworth, an actress of whom you have doubtless some
knowledge.

Miss Ellsworth is at her best in ingémte «parts, but
has frequently demonstrated her ability to assume
“heavy” characters.

She is desirous of obtaining a position for the coming
season in one of your companies, and I do not hesitate
to say that I think she would add one more to the radiant
galaxy of “stars” in your employ already.

Any favor which you may show her will be highly
appreciated by,

Yours very cordially,
. Abner V. McPherson.

INTRODUCING A COACHMAN TO A PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYER.

My Dear Mr. Jones:

The bearer, Edward Cobb, has been in my employ for
two years and has always given entire satisfaction.

He is leaving me of his free will, and I recommend
him heartily as a good driver and one who is kind and
faithful to horses.

Very sincerely yours,
John Watson, Jr.

'AsKING PERMISSION TO INTRODUCE A FRIEND.

Dear Miss Watsotn:

A friend, whom I have known ever since we were
schoolmates, is spending a week in the city. I would
like him to meet you, as I have several times spoken to
him regarding you, and he knows how highly I esteem
your acquaintance. -

May I bring him to call some evening before the end
of the week if you have no other engagements that will
prevent? Should your time be otherwise occupied, of
course we will have to forego the pleasure, but I trust
that you will be able to receive us.  

Sincerely yours,

LE’r“rERsf or CONDOLENCE.

These letters are for the expression of sympathy in all
sorrow and affliction, and should be couched in tender
terms, with a view to healing the wound from which your
friend is suffering.

Simple language, through which runs like a silver
thread a gleam of hope, is most comforting to any form
of bereavement.

Never refer in detail to the cause of distress, as a dis-‘

cussion of the subject only renews the pangs of heart-
ache and mental agony. Do not attempt to reason the
cause of the unhappy event, and do not prate of “being
reconciled” when the grief is fresh, as it only awakens
a. feeling of resentment. ,/

t LETTERS OF CONDOLENCE should be written upon black-
edged paper, even though the writer is unacquainted with
the deceased.

In cases of very dear friends an exception may be
made to this rule, as it is understood that the lack of con-
ventionality means no lack of sympathy.

Be careful not to make these letters too long, as it is not
natural that a mourner should be in the mood to peruse

a long or closely-written effusions.

46 Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer.

Try to include each member of the family in your letter,

if not in detail, by some general allusion. Be extremely
neat about the stamping and sealing of these letters and

see that they are sent as soon after the sad event as pos-
sible.

UPON THE DEATH or A HUSBAND.

My dear Mrs. C.:

It is with great sorrow that I learn of your terrible af-
ﬂiction and I hasten to offer just a word of sympathy.

The things which we do not understand in this life so
far exceed what we do understand that I have come to
consider that there must be a good reason for everything,
and that before we die it will reveal itself or be revealed
to us.

My heart goes out to you daily and hourly.

I cannot tell you hovx/‘best to bear the blow, for I feel
sure that, were I in your place, I could not bear it.

If love and sympathy will help to heal your wound I
offer it freely, and to show you the depth of my sincerity
I assure you that my eyes are ﬁlled with tears this minute.

Kindly express my condolences to your dear one’s
brother and sister, as I know that they, like yourself, are
overwhelmed by the dark shadow.

May the sun shine soon. upon your heart, my dear Mrs.
, is the wish of

ON THE DEATH‘ or A CHILD.

Dear Cora and Edgar;

My heart bleeds for you, my friends, in this hour of
your affliction, but, oh, how well I realize the utter use-
lessness of words wl1en one is writhing in the darkness of
death’s black shadow!

I can only beseech you to bear your grief bravely, re-
membering that to» suffer isthe human lot and that all
clouds, however dark, must have a silver lining,

This sorrow will bring you nearer to each other, and if
such a thing is possible, it will make you dearer.

How gladly would I soothe your aching hearts if I
could, but there are hours when the most earnest desires
are futile and the most zealous efforts almost worse than
useless.

Time alone can heal your bitter wounds, but perhaps
the knowledge that I am sorrowing both with and for you
may cast a ray of comfort over your darkened pathway.

Sincerely your friend,

LETTERS or CONGRATULATION.

 

LE’I"I‘ERS OF CoNGR_A'1‘ULATIoiN form a medium for ex-=
pressing pleasure at the good fortune, success or lhap«pi-
ness of a friend or acquaintance. These letters should be
Written in the happiest possible style, without so much as
a hintof anything unpleasant to mar their harmony.

Their greatest charm lies in their absolute conviction of
spontaneous and genuine sincerity.

They should be sent as soon as possible after hearing
of the event. Trylas far as possible to suit your senti-
ments to the nature of the event which calls for the letter,
and do not fail to include every member ofthe family
who is, or should be, an object of congratulation.

ON THE MARRIAGE OF A BACHELOR.

My dear Brown:

The tidings of your marriage were wafted to my ears

There is no one among my acquaintances more deserving

ON A FORTUNATE SPECULATION.

My dear Jones:

I am pleased, indeed, to hear that you are on such good
terms with the ﬁckle old lady whom both of us have tried
so hard and so long to inﬂuence,

Dame Fortune’s smile has brought you something sub-
stantial this time, and I am heartily ashamed of her for
not having “smiled” a few years sooner. I

Now that your “luck has changed,” as the saying goes,
I trust I shall soon see you seated upon the lap of luxury,
for, after all the years of patient waiting which you have
endured, it would be impossible for any one to call you
other than deserving.

Cordially your friend,
Jonas W.

 

ON LEARNING or A BETROTHAL‘.

My dear Dave:
I hear that you are engaged, and to the charming Miss

 

Florence .

If this is the case, please accept my heartfelt congratu-
lations. Miss W. is a beautiful girl, and as good as she
is beautiful. That she could make you other than a true
and noble wife is nothing short of impossible.

May your wedding day approach upon the swift wings -

of Time, and your years of co-nnubial bliss drag from

I their Weight of happiness.

She1don’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. 53

Of course I shall see you before the wedding, for even
if it were to-morrovv I should come at once, for I must
shake your hand to make this letter more emphatic.

£.,O\/E LETTERS.

 

To model a love letter that will ﬁll every requirement
of a heart pulsing and throbbing with ardent emotion
would be almost as difﬁcult as “chaining the lightning.”

Every lover must form his own rapturous phrases ac-
cording to the dictates of the little god who whispers
in his ear, hence it is my aim to merely outline a few of
these letters which may serve as a guide to the timid
beginner.

It may seem foolish and even useless to urge upon a
lover the necessity for plain handwriting in a missive of
this description, for when the brain is revolving with
passionate thoughts, when the blood is coursing madly
through the veins, hot with the fever of love, how is it
possible for the hand that wields the pen to mo-ve slowly
and cautiously and form each character with accurate
precision? It is argued by some that the heart will in—
terpretl what the eye fails to decipher; nevertheless, I urge
plainness of writing in love letters, and as a reason I will
quote a familiar illustration.

A lover, writing impulsively, of course, assured his
sweetheart that “he would love to kiss her under the
silent stars ;” but his writing was so bad that she could
only read it thus: “He would love to kick her under the
cellar stairs,”

Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. 55

Heaven only knows the outcome of such. a reading, but
all suppositions in the case should act as warnings to the
careless Writer.

Punctuation is of equal importance with plain writing,
for the mis-pla.cement of one comma may alter the sense
of a sentence so completely as to cause not only misunder-
standings, but estrangements.

LOVE, as the sweetest, most sacred sentiment of the
human heart, should be voiced in earnest, digniﬁed lan-
guage, Whether falling from the lips or from the pen of a
lover; therefore avoid all foolish and absurd expressions.
Bear in mind that no wise woman’s heart is won by silly
ﬂattery. On the contrary, insipid compliments tend only
to disgust her.

Extravagant adulation has a superﬁcial appearance‘
when expressed in deﬁnite characters upon a sheet of
paper,and “honeyed vvords,” as they are called, are apt to
sound ridiculous if scattered too freely through the pages
of a letter.

Remember that women angels exist only in pictures,
and that men angels are unknown even upon canvas, with
the exception of the “fallen angels” made famous by
Doré and Dante; consequently, even ,in courtship-, the
word “angel” is tabooed as being what Herbert Spencer
would call an “unconceivable hypothesis.”

The most satisfactory love letter is one that blends
delicacy of feeling with warmth of expression, homage
with dignity, tenderness with strength. To this add a

t knowledge of the nature and taste of the loved one, and

56 SheIdon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer.

you may be sure that you have conveyed just the mes-
sage that her heart lo-ngs for, and in the manner most
pleasing and satisfactory.

Be not too humble in your utterances, as great humil-
ity borders closely upon servility, and no right—minded
woman. desires a slave for a husband. In the words of
Lord Byron,  

“Do proper homage to thine idol’s eyes,
But not too humbly, else she will despise
Thee and thy suit———”

To sum it all up, then, avoid carefully all exaggera-
tion of statement and profusion of endearing epithets
which characterizes morbid sentiment and makes one ap-
pear ridiculous, even in the eyes of the adored one in
her moments of disillusionment.

The following letters are offered merely as guides of
style and diction. The entire vocabulary of Cupid can-

not be contained in so small a book, neither can original-

ity of thought, when prompted by the tender passion, be
transcribed by the facile pen of the most able author.

A DECLARATION OF LOVE.

My dear Miss 
I have something to say to you which I would much
prefer to communicateverbally‘ than in writing, but as

the fates unkindly decree that we be separated for a time,

I must do my best to express my desires upon paper.
You must know, my dear Miss G————, that I have _

Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. 57

long admired you, and you have guessed, no doubt, that
even tenderer sentiments were awakening in my heart;
yet even now I feel a timidity which seems almost un-
manly in uttering the simple words, I love you.

In speaking these sacred words, I feel sure that I have

said all. No burning terms of fond adulation, which I '

confess are constantly springing to my lips, are needed
to convince you of the honesty of my confession.

I love you dearly, devotedly and with my whole heart
and soul, and I shall await with the greatest anxiety your
answer to this letter. Of my position and family I need
not speak, as you are thoroughly familiar withaboth, as
you are with my personal worthiness.

‘Will you crown my life with the sweetest boo-n that
earth holds for me, the right to call you my 0-Wn, my
wife, my darling?

With tenderest affection, I am,

Your lover,
Charles M, C---_.

THE LOVED ONE’s REPLY.

My dear Charles:

No, your letter was not altogether a surprise, and I
am not ashamed to confess that I should have been dis-
ap-pointed had I not received it.

Ever since we met I have been studying my heart, and
not for one moment have I doubted my affection for the

58 I Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer.

one whom I am, oh, so sure is all that is noble, loyal and
deserving!

I love you, Charles, and I will be your wife, and I am
glad to be able to tell you that both mamma and papa
are delighted, so that when you write to them the letter
will be but a mere formality,

I long to see you, to talk about our wedding; so do
come soon, my dear one, to your happy sweetheart,

Dora.

ANOTHER DECLARATION.

My dear‘Miss Anna:

At our last meeting, which seems like a dream because
of its sweetness, I had a secret in my heart which I
longed to impart to you, but which, like a coward in love,
I dared not mention.

In the days that have intervened I have grown more
brave, probably because in separation I have recognized
the utter desolation of life without your presence; and
dismay at a future without your smile, has urged me on
to a little more courage.  

I love you, Anna! Yet how I fear to speak the words,
lest in my eagerness, I have misunderstood your gentle
smiles and overrated my own worthiness.

I beg that you will reflect before you reply to my letter,
and if there be aught about me deserving of your love,
bestow it upon me, most gracious of women!

—Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. $9

My heart is so full of the future with you as its guid-
ing star that it is no wonder, dear one, if my pen runs
riot; but if you love me you will understand that I am
mad» with the fever of love in spite of my efforts at calm-
ness.

Before you answer my question‘I wish to tell you some-
thing of my ﬁnancial condition and expectations, b-ut I
have decided, for reasons which you will understand, to
put the second communication in another envelope, so that
no breath of sordid matters shall mar the tenderness of
this declaration.

I I shall await your reply with a lover’s eagerness, so be
merciful, my adored one, and write as soon as possible.

Your love will come to me like a precious gift from
Heaven; your indifference will be a blow which I can
bear if I must; so, above all things, be absolutely sure of
your heart before you answer.

Lovingly and with hope,

Your faithful
Donald.‘

THE REPLY.
My dear, dear Donald:
How could you ever have doubted my love for a sinle

minute? And yet, I confess I have tried, oh, so hard,
to disguise my affection, for fear that you might consider.

I me unmaidenly.

6o Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer.

I love you with all my heart and soul, and if you had’
not loved me I should certainly have died broken-
hearted.

The second letter which you wrote was duly received,
and, of course, I turned it right over to papa, as I did not
care a straw how much salary you were earning, if it
was only enough to keep us from starving. Unfor-
tunately, papa is a little more particular than that, and,
oh! Donald, darling, here comes the one unpleasant part
of my letter: Papa and mamma both think you are too
poor to marry; but we will convince them, will we not,
that twelve hundred a year is a great plenty, for, of
course, we can do without all sorts of things when we
have each other! I am sure they will yield if we argue

% very patiently.

I shall look for you every day and hour until you
come ; so-see to it, please, that I do not grow weary with
waiting.

With my ‘fondest love,
Your waiting Anna.

“A SECOND ATTEMPT TO WIN A LADv’s FAVOR.

My dear Miss L———:

In spite of the fact that one year ago you refused an
offer to marry me, I am once again returning to ask for
your favor. -

That twelve long months have passed, months made
dark as midnight to me because of my bitter disappoint-

§heldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. 55
ment, and that I am today more eager than ever to call
you mine, will, I fondly trust, weigh somewhat in the bal-
ance of your regard.

I can honestly say that you are dearer to me to—day
than ever, in spite of my having met a score of fair ones
during the past year whose graces would have charmed

me had not my heart already been in the keeping of a  
I fairer one. 5

Once more I ask you to be my wife, and I stand ready
to exhibit to you the records of my life, together with
the hopes, ambitions and prospects which I cherish for
the future.

If your heart has changed toward me, I beg that you
will whisper it quickly in my ear; then trustto my honor
and loyalty to repay you for your graciousness.

My address is familiar to you, and I close by saying
that a line will ﬁnd me awaiting your slightest wish and
eager to ﬂy to your side at a moment’s notice.

THE LADY’s REPLY, UNFAVORABLE.

My dear Mr. Chapman:

It is with a feeling of sincere regret that I am forced
to answer your letter in the negative.

Nothing, to my mind, is sadder than to know you are
beloved, and by one so wholly worthy, and yet feel one-
self utterly incapable of returning such affection.

But this, my dear friend, is my lamentable case. I do
not love you, and I am too honest to» say otherwise. I
esteem you highly, I respect you fully. If I had any
love in my heart for any one, such as you desire, I should
compliment myself upon choosing a man of your own
standard of excellence; but, alas, I have not yet felt the
happiness of love-—-my heart is empty of all sentiments
except ﬁlial affection and earnest friendship.

For your sake, I cannot help wishing this were other-=
wvise, yet I know you to be too manly to allow the dis-

appointment to affect you. You will go on in your
chosen way bravely, steadfastly and successfully.

I trust that this letter will not terminate our pleasant
friendship, yet I insist upon nothing that can add one
pang to your sufferings. Believe me, I shall always be
interested in your career, and at every step through life
I shall observe you with the eye of friendship, and my
earnest wish is that you may soon be happy.

To A YOUNG LADv’s FATHER.
R. G. Burns, Esq.,

Tremont Avenue,
Brooklyn, N. Y.
Dear Mr. Burns:

I am positive that you must have seen for some 
that I have become deeply attached to your char ﬂing
daughter, 1\/Iiss Daisy, and no doubt you have been won-
dering why I did not address you.

My only explanation is this: I did not know until last
evening that my affection was reciprocated, and I hold
that there is little use in asking a lady’s hand of her par-
ents before one has learned her individual wishes on the
subject.

You are familiar with my position, socially and ﬁnan-.

cially, I think, but if there is anything you Would like to
know about me further, I beg that you will not hesitate

to ask it, as it is my earnest desire to win your entire
esteem and conﬁdence. I will do my best to make your
daughter happy, and in giving your consent I trust you
will add a blessing, so that from the moment of our be-
trothal there shall be nothing but harmony.

Possibly you may consider me overconﬁdent in this
letter, but the knowledgethat you love your daughter
and that your daughter loves me is an argument which
justiﬁes me in the appearance of certainty.

I am unworthy of your affection.

OFFER or MARRIAGE TO A Wmow.

My dear Madam:

I trust that this letter will not come to you an entirely
unwelcome guest, but hope that in your heart of hearts
you were secretly expecting it.

No doubt you recognized the symptoms of 1ove’s fever
in the pressure of my hand at parting, in the glance of my
eyes, which could not help discovering to you the con-
dition of my feelings; you must have seen, only too
plainly that I loved you. .

To win your love in return is the one ambition of my
life. To see you installed in my home, its mistress and
my wife, is the one hope which at present consumes my
entire nature. If you have but a spark of affection for
‘me in your heart, I implore you to fan it into a brighter
ﬂame, for should it fade and die, the light of my exist-
ence would, I am sure, die with it.

66 Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer.

I beg an immediate word from you to still the tumult
in my heart, for at the present writing I am totally unﬁt
for business, so heavily does the cloud of apprehension
and uncertainty rest upon me.

Anything you may desire to know of me I will gladly
tell, or, if you prefer, I will refer you to those who know
me intimately, and to whom my past life is as open as this
letter.

Until I receive your reply I shall think of you con-
stantly. Pray, then, be merciful and speed your answer.

My dear Mr. Whitney:

That a wido-w can blush over a love letter is surely
proof that her heart is young, and I am blushing now
over your ardent letter.

A young girl would no doubt play with you as a cat
with a mouse, fancying in her innocence that this would
increase your affection; but I, who have loved before,
know well what you are suffering; therefore, I hasten, at
your request, to answer your question.

If you can love a woman whose youth is p-ast, whose
experiences are ripe and whose heart has once been
broken, it is not for me to trifle with that love, and I
hereby accept it gratefully and proudly. In return for

She1don’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. 67

your affection I offer you my honest regard. I respect
and admire you, and, yes, I am fond of you———so fond that
I know I shall be happier with you than without, and this,
I think, will be sufﬁcient for our future.

I shall be glad to see you as soon as you can come to
me, as, of course, there will be many details of o-ur wed-
ding that -we must talk over. I

I know your standing socially and ﬁnancially, and you
know mine, so I am glad to say that there is little to be
said on these necessary but always a triﬂe embarrassing
subjects.

Until we meet, believe me to be as happy as yourself,
and allow me to sign myself,

I am honored indeed by your recent letter, and, believe
me, I would spare you, if I could, the pain in my answer.

from that day to this no face, no voice has rekindled it.

I donot believe it possible for me to love again, but I
can respect, esteem and admire a. man worthy of these
sentiments, and such a man I know you to be.

In your natural resentment at my refusal I beg you to
consider my absolute honesty. I would be wronging

It is with fear and trembling that I take my pen and
paper to write a letter which shall convey to you, dear

- Nellie, exactly how I feel toward you.

We have been boy and girl together, and no doubt your‘-.
affection for me is only that of one child for another;
but do you realize, Nellie, that we are both eighteen———old
enough to feel the thrill of something more intense than
juvenile affection?

I hardly know when it was that I woke up to that fact,
but I think it was the last time that I kissed you playing
“Copenhagen”; it went over me like a ﬂash that I should
not have done it—that your dear lips should be sacred
to the touch only of a lover.  

Then it occurred to me, Nellie, that I desired to be

’ that lover, and then, oh, then, I discovered that I loved

you, not with boyish affection, but with a man’s earnest-
ness and passion.

We are both young, but, oh, Nellie, will you not try to
love me as I love you? Will you try to look upon me as

.,the lover who kneels at your feet and kisses your hand
while he pleads for that dearer position of husband?

I cannot help thinking that our parents will approve
of this, but, of course, it rests with you whether I shall
mention the matter to them, as, being a man, my heart
may have awakened ﬁrst, while yours, dear Nellie, still
sleeps the sleep of innocence.

Write to me, Nellie, and try to tell me. how you feel.

I-f I am mistaken in my sentiments, tell me so at once,
for my heart seems bursting with its burden of im-
patience ‘

I think of you constantly, and, oh, I love you so!
Really, I cannot help thinking that my life will be blasted
if you refuse me, yet to present that as an argument to
win your love, young as I am, I know would be, unmanly.

I shall haunt the post ofﬁce until I receive your reply;
so hurry, Nellie, and write a word to your eager, im-
patient and inexperienced lover,

Charlie.

 

THE YOUNG G1RL’s REPLY.

My dear ‘friend Charlie:
I was so astonished when I received your letter that I

I hardly knew What to do, and then it came to me, as it

always does in my perplexities, that the best thing to do
was to take it to mamma.

And what do you think my dear, good mamrna said?

That “Charlie was a ﬁne young man, and that she
would be glad to have him as a son, but that we must not
dream of being engaged even until our school days were
over.”  

Isn’t that terrible, Charlie? And yet it is right! As
young as I am, I can see the wisdom in mamma’s de-
cision, for, of course, we must complete our educations
in order to be respected by intelligent people. Mamma
says that too many young people forget the importance of
this, and that they marry before. either their bodies,
minds or moral natures are well developed, and that this
is one great cause for so many unhappy marriages.

It is going to be hard for you to wait if you really
love me, Charlie; but, then, you know we can see each
other; only you must not kiss me any more when we play
“Copenhagen.”

I hope I have not divulged my real feelings in this let-
ter. Mamma told me that I must not, and I always obey
her. ‘

We shallbe glad to see you next Sunday afternoon;
but, dear, dear Charlie, please don’t show that you love
me, for I am sure both my brother and sister would tease
me terribly.

We shall dine at six o’clock,_ and mamma says “be sure
to come.”

3heldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. ‘71

I am of the opinion that she wishes to talk to you.
From your little school friend,
Nellie.

P. S.——I know it is not proper to add a postscript to a I

letter, but I just wished to say that I shall play no “kiss-
ing games” in future. I quite agree with you that my
lips should be kept pure and sacred for my lover.

I Nellie.

FROM A LOVER ABSENT ON BUSINESS.
My dear Girl:

My hours are occupied with the sordid cares of busi-

ness, and it is not often that I have an opportunity to

write to you. I think of you continually, however, and
your fair image is constantly in my heart. I long for the
time to ‘arrive when I can again hold you in my arms and
hear anew your expressions of affection. Everything
goes on with me as satisfactorily and prosperously as I
could expect, and within a few weeks I hope to return to
you with the satisfaction that my task has been perfectly
performed. Then, with the assurance that your future
will be p-ro-perly provided for, I shall ask you to set the
day which shall give you into my keeping forever. This
absence has only made me realize more fully how very

y dear you are to me, and how thankful I-ought to be that

you have given me your regard and love. Be careful of

your health, and remember that my life and happiness de-
pend upon yours. With the love that’ you will atlways
possess, Y our faithful‘,

S————.

FROM A LADY WHOSE LOVER HAS ACCUSED HER or‘
I BEING FICKLE.

My dear Charles:

What words are these you use to me? Faithless, ﬁckle,
careless! How can you so far have misunderstood me
as to entertain such thoughts for a moment P’ Since I
promised you my love, I have never had one thought that
was not devoted to you, nor a single desire that did not
consider your happiness. If this is the best return that
you can make for a woman’s love, I shall have to With-
draw my affection from one who esteems it so lightly.
You have repeatedly assured me that nothing could in any
way change the current of your regard, but I see that I
was mistaken in you; you evidently do not possess that
deep—seated, unselﬁsh devotion that is the only true return
for the gift of a vvoman’s heart. Much as it pains me to
do so, I am forced by motives of self-respect to say that
unless you can put such ideas out of your mind at once
and forever, I shall have to vvithdravv the pledge which I
gave you. The future is in your hands.

Sincerely yours,

M-a---.

LETTER DE A SOLDIER ORDERED ON SERVICE.
My dear Miss H

I, have just received orders to join my regiment, and

 

we are to leave for Cuba to-morrovv morning. I wish
that I could call uponyo-up and say good-by, but that is
impossible. Whether I shall ever return or not is a ques-
tion, but I am going to fulﬁll my duty to our country,
and by so doing I believe that you will think more highly
of me than if I vvere"a laggard in the ﬁght, notwithstand-
ing that affection for others Would be the only considera-
tion which would induce me to remain behind.

Considering that I am about to face unknown dangers,
I have no right to address you as a lover at this time, but
I dosclaim the right to express the sentiments which have
been uppermost in my heart for some time.i I would, in-
deed, like to carry with me the assurance that you return
my affection, but this I cannot ask for nor expect.

Should fate be so kind as to allow me to return to you,
I shall ask you whether I may not receive that greatest
boon to man——a vvoman’s love. Meantime, I wish to as-
sure you that under the coat of one of Uncle Sam’s Boys
in Blue there beats a heart that is devoted to one fair
being whom I hope will some day brighten my life with
her presence. I

I ask of you no pledge, but I pledge to you my life if
my country does not require it.

More than this I cannot say at present, but if I am

spar-ed to return to you I may then more plainly outline
my plans and desires for the future.

Ever your sincere and devoted,

Harry L-—---.

RENEWED OFFER BY A REJECTED SUITOR.

My dear Miss X
In spite of the discouraging nature of our last inter‘-

view, I again venture to address you in hope that per-
haps you can now consider my desires more favorably.
I value you and your affection so highly that I cannot
relinquish both without one more effort. I do not ask
you to take pity on me or to encourage me from feelings
of generosity, but I do ask that you reconsider my re-
quest. It is just possible that in a short time you may
feel more disposed to grant me that happiness which
you have been obliged to deny“ me, and if this should be
the case I trust you will not fail to give me some intima-
tion that my attentions will not be altogether distasteful
to you.

Whether your feelings change in this way or not, I
Wish to assure you that I shall never be less devoted to
you than I am at present, but that you will always hold
first place in the esteem of

Yours devotedly,

REQUEST TO BE ALLOWED TO CALL.
Dear Miss W :
We have only met once, but at that one meeting

 

you made such an impression upon me that I long for a.
further acquaintance. Forgive me for the liberty I take

in making such an assertion when I am almost a stranger

to you, but I have never met any one whom I admired
more than I do yourself. If you will allow me the pleas-
ure of your acquaintance I shall appreciate it most highly.
I realize that I am transgr-essing the rules of etiquette
in thus writing to you, but I trust my earnestness will
excuse my lack of formality.

Will you not favor me with a line to say that you are
not entirely displeased at my presumption and that you-
will allow me to call upon you at your home? I shall
await your reply with anxiety, but also with the hope
that you will be so generous as to grant my request.

Sincerely yours,

 

James S .

 

LETTER FROM A TIMID YOUNG MAN.
My dear Miss R :
It is with no small degree of uncertainty that I now

 

venture to address you upon a subject that I have re-
frained from asking you to consider because I have
feared that your decision might be unfavorable. For

,months past one feeling, that of love, has possessed my

heart, and one image, yours, has occupied my mind. All

76 Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer.

my thoughts have been of you and the hours that I have
spent in your p-resence have been the happiest of my life,
even though the thought that I might lose that happiness
has caused me pain. I do not know whether you have
guessed at the question which has so often trembled upon
my lips, but which I have not had the courage to speak.

I love you, passionately and devotedly, and I ask your
love in return. Can you ﬁnd in your heart any spark of
affection for me which will make it possible for you to
bid me hope that I may some day call you my own?

I shall await your reply with a hopeful feeling that
your heart will dictate an answer that will make me more
than happy.  

Yours ever,

Clarence W--——.

LETTER FROM A LOVER WHO HAS BEEN ACCEPTED.

' My darling S—————:

I cannot wait until to—night to tell you how happy you
have made me, but send you this line to say that I am
simply overjoyed at the knowledge that my affection is
returned. I had been so anxious for the assurance
which you gave me that I can hardly realize that you
really have intrusted your future to my care. Our love
is not the ﬂeeting fancy of childhood, but the ﬁrm, never-
ceasing affection of mature years, and I know we will
neither of us err in yielding to it absolutely. I shall

Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. 77

never cease to appreciate the boon which you have grant-
ed me, and a lifetime of constant devotion shall be your

proof of the sincerity of my love. I shall see you before

many ho-urs have elapsed and shall long for the time to
pass, so that I may again hear you utter those sweet
words, “I love you.”
With undying devotion,
Yours,

Will.

 

LETTER TO A MALE FRIEND ASKING ADVICE.

My dear Charles:

You and I have been good friends for years, such good
friends that I now ask your advice upon a very delicate
matter. To be brief I may say at once that I am in
love with two charming girls, but am afraid to pro-
pose to either one for fear that if I should be accepted
I might afterward discover that I loved the other one
more, and cause. pain to the fair one who accepted me as
well as to myself.

Either one of them would make a most desirable wife,
and I am utterly unable to choose between them. Wikll
you notgive me the beneﬁt of your good judgment?
One of these girls, Madge, is a lively, witty, magnetic
damsel, two years younger than myself, and I know that
I would never tire of her variable moods and unceasing

V vivacity. The other, Ellen, is a stately maiden of my

own age, endowed with an aristocratic repose that is at

78 Sheldon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer.

once restful and satisfying. I know that her affection
would be like a mighty river, broad, deep and ever the
same.  

Now, what am I going to do? I feel assured that
either one of them would accept me, for they have not
been disinclined to receive my attentions, but I cannot
marry them both and I dread to make a choice. Probably
you can decide which of them would be best for me to
marry and which of them would make the happier wife.
You are a better judge of character than'I am, and I
shall abide by your decision.

Yours as ever,

J-Ohfl NI----"_.

REPLY TO THE ABOVE.
My dear John:

Of all the uncertain idiots in this world I think you
are the worst. Any man who can’t make up his mind
as to whether he lo-ves one woman more than another is
either a candidate for an insane asylum or for an old
women’s home———I don’t know which.

Since you ask my candid opinion, you shall have it.
I do not believe you love either one of these estimable
young women one quarter as much as you love yourself.
For their sakes I advise you not to propose to either, but
to put all thought of them out of your mind. No man
with half the instincts of manhood would seek a woman’s

ments as those you confess. Both of these girls are a
great deal too good for you. Do not think of asking
any woman to intrust her happiness to your care until
you feel for her the deep devotion that does not admit
of the possibility of division.
Your sincere friend,

Charles.

To A LOVER WHO Is DISSIPATED.
Dear H

I am grieved beyond measure at your failure to refrain

from indulgence in liquor. When you asked me to
pledge myself to you it was with the p-romise that you
would correct your bad habits and give meevery reason
to esteem and respect you. No woman can possibly en-
tertain affection for a man who values it so lightly as to
disregard her ‘wishes, especially when those wishes are
designed for his own good. If you really have any af-
fection for me, you will triumph over your temptation
and tear yourself away" from the evil associates whose
only desire is to lead you into that manner of life whose
only end is misery and degradation. y

Be manly and resolute, and there is nothing that you
may not accomplish. Whell you have built up a charac-
ter worthy of my esteem and conﬁdence I may say more.
I shall always be your friend as long as you do right, and
I shall never refuse you my advice and encouragement.

Further than this, do not ask until you feel in your own

heart that you have gained the position that you should
occupy“

VALENTINES.

 

The privileges of St. Valentine’s Day (February 14th)
are not infrequently made use of to express a passion that
has been secretly entertained. The sender of the valen-
tine is supposeld to be unknown, but few who have re-
ceived these dainty messages of affection are really in
doubt as to the sender.

The valentine often affords to a discreet or timid lover
an opportunity to declare himself more openly than he
would in a letter, and it gives to a woman one of the few
opportunities she has for signifying her regard for one
of the opposite sex.

Many a sweet and lasting love experience has followed
the interchange of these dainty missives.

The valentine may be an actual love letter; a poem,
either original or copied; as dainty card inscribed with
the writer’s sentiments; or a gift, such as a bouquet of
ﬂowers.

It is impossible to write a model that will suit all tastes
and conditions, but a pretty valentine poem reads as
follows:

“To know that we adore

To such reﬁned excess

That, though the heart would break with mosre,
It could no-t do with less——

This is love-’tis like mine,

All for thee, my Valentine.”

NOTES OF CEREMONY AND COMPLI-
MENT.

A NOTE is a brief communication by which persons
make known to each other their wishes, compliments or
commands.

They are usually more formal in style than letters, and
seldom embrace more than one subject, which is stated
without any attempt at rhetorical embellishment.

NOTES OF CEREMONY are chieﬂy used in Wedding,
Dim/zer or Party invitations, and are usually written in
the third person and dated at the bottom.

They must be short, plain, polite, and of a reserved
manner of expression.

Notes written in the third person must never be signed.

The paper and envelopes should be plain and of the
best quality. For weddings, pure white or cream color
should be used, but for other functions the tint is optional
with the taste of the writer.

SIZE AND SHAPE in stationery are a matter of fashion
and are consequently variable.

Both paper and envelopes may bear an engraved mono-
gram, initial or the coat—of-arms of the writer.

Wedding notes may bear monograms or not, but if this
decoration is used it must be composed of the initial let-
ters o-f the surname of both bride and groom.

Only the name and title should be written upon the en-

SheIdon’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. 9i

velope inclosing the note, after which this should be in-
closed in a larger, thinner envelope, upon which the full
name and address of the person for whom it is intended
is Written.

Wedding invitations are issued about two weeks before
the ceremony by the parents or nearest friends of the
bride. i

They may be written. or engraved on note paper or
cards, but the note form is generally preferred for all
ceremonial invitations.

BUSINESS LETTERS.

’A BUSINESS LETTER should deal exclusively with busi-
ness matters. It should be Written with the utmost care,
in order that there can be no misunderstanding.

Be brief but grammatical, and alvvayspunctuate cor-2
rectly, as the omission or misplacement of a comma may
change the meaning of a sentence.

Never mention social matters in at business letter un-
less to a very old friend, and even then the message
should be added after the signature.

Written orders for goods should state clearly the quan-
tity, description of articles desired and directions for
shipment.

In ordering books or other publications always men-
tion the title and the name of the author. If there are
several editions of the same work, the size, style of
binding and publisher’s p-rice should be mentioned.

Always order dry goods from a sample, if possible.

If one or more articles of different kinds are ordered
it is well to take a separate line for each, in order to
avoidpossible confusion. Never use a half sheet of
paper when a Whole one can be procured.

LETTER AND BILL HEADS should be kept distinct from

She1don’s Twentieth Century Letter Writer. 93

2

each other and only used for their separate purposes.
It is not proper to write a social letter upon either.

Always write a business letter with COPYING FLUID, so

that it may be copied and kept at your ofﬁce. This prac-

tice is important in all mercantile transactions, as it
oftentimes saves an endless amount of trouble.

Do not read to others business letters any more than

private letters to disinterested friends, for the contents  

are not entirely your own; they are the joint property of
yourself and the Writer. 2

The Business Letters given here cover a variety of
subjects and may be of use to the reader as guides and
aids both in the lines of business specified as well as
many others.

AUTHORS’ LETTERS.

Write with black ink.

Use white paper, ruled; letter size is preferable.

Leave a margin oniboth sides of the sheet and at the
bottom, so that the writing will not become smudged or
defaced by handling. Write upon one side of the paper
only,

Number each sheet properly.

Write very plainly.

Use no abbreviations except those which you wish to
appear in print.

Punctuate carefully.

Underscore words with one line where italics are de-
sired; two lines for SMALL CAPITALS; three lines for
LARGE CAPITALS.

Do not write private communications on the same sheet
with your copy. A

Always inclose a stamped and addressed envelope for
the return of your MSS.

, Do not write the editor or publisher an unnecessarily
long letter. Remember that his time, as Well as your
own,-is valuable.

If your MSS. is offered gratis, say so in your note to
the editor. If a special price is desired, name it at the

bottom of your copy, or if you are willing to accept the
price which the periodical is in the habit of paying, merely
write “Regular rates” at the beginning or ending of your
article.

Do not expect too prompt a reply. All editors are over-
run with MSS. and it takes time to read them. Do not
imagine that your MSS. will not be read. There are
very few editors who are not painstaking and thorough
in their work. A

Avoid corrections in your MS. It is better to copy
a sheet of MS. than to submit it with erasures and cor-
rections. y

I have just completed a novel of one hundred thousand

Dear Madam:

Your letter of the 12th inst. at hand. We regret to say

In spite of your discouraging letter, I take the liberty
of writing once more to say that I have read the South

Miss Alice Denman,
.44 Walnut Ave., City.
Dear Madam:

As you seem so desirous of having us read your MS.
We feel obliged to state our position more fully.

Your name is not familiar to us, nor to the reading
public, and as there are a number of well—known writers
on this particular subject whose works we can obtain at
almost a moment’s notice, we naturally hesitate about
spending the time necessary for reading your production.

If you wish to leave the MS. with us we will read
it, but it may be weeks, even months, before we can give
you an answer, and in the meantime you might be able
to secure a publisher.

After this statement of the conditions we leave the
case to you,’ regretting that we can offer you no brighter
outlook. .Very truly yours,

A Marcy & May.
