~-'"I MEAN TO BE A MAN."
o. A man who was passing along.
g the  road  one  morning, nmet a  little  
g boy,  seven   years  of  age,  with   his: books under his arm, going  to school.'   2. After  talking  with  the  boy  a
~'few mlinutes, hlie said to hinm: "Well,  
a Rmy little  boy, what do  you  intend  to
be,  wvhen yo-u  are  grown  up?"'8
3. He had asked many other boys;e the  same  question  before;  and  some 4
~*  a4                      4&amp;-              D8' told hinm they meant to be farmers; ~
- some, merchants; and some, lawyers. *
4. But what do you think was, the
+ answer of this little boy?  Said he:  
I mean to be a MAN!"
4~- 5. It matters very little whether s
~ he become a farmer, or a; merchant,.
+ or a lawyer.  If he be a MAN, he will *
s have the respect and esteel of all *
B8v who know him.            -tJ
6. Many little boys think t-jiat, if.
v they were to grow up, and be as  
s large as their fathers, they would,..
- therefore, be men.    -
s--  7. But, in one sense, some persons 4
never become- men; but are great 4. boys, even after they have grown up..8. Ask your parents what makes'
a man, and they will tell you, it is  
F not only to attain the   and stat-'
ure of a man, but to have the wisidom  
and knowledge that befit a- man.   -e
F  9. Now, as you know what makes.
a man, resolve, like this little boy, 4
to be one.

THE TRUTHFUL BOT..4
Once there was a little boy,
With curly hair and pleasant eye,-  
A boy who always loved the truth,.4
And never, never told a lie.
And, when he skipped away to school,    *
The children all about would cry:
"There goes the curly-headed boy,-      4.
The boy who never told a lie."    -     s.4
And eVry body loved him much,            *
Because -he always told the truth;
And often, as he older grew,'Twas said: "There goes the honest youth." 4
And, when the people, standing near,
Would turn to ask the reason why;..
The answer would be always this:         -
"Because he never told a lie."         4:
Learn, little boys, from this brave lad,
Like him, to speak the candid truth,    4

8 to get out of old Vim's reach, and thus 4
vex him more than he could tease her..
6. She would climb up the oak 4

be in the fields as you or Vim," said

said George; "for boys and dogs are -
3 not made to stay in the house, like  
girls and cats."                - 8
13. "True," said Jane; "but what'
harm can there be for us to go out in -
the fields, if we choose?  Do call off
old Vim, or you will teach him to be 4
e cross, and bite poor Tab, when she'
is in the house."
14. George took old Vim  by the

8&gt; had gone, Tab came down from the 4
- tree, and Jane took her to the house, e
w where- they were as good friends as

aF    ~CHARLES AND HIS BIG HAT,
a-  1. A boy whose name was Chailes, 8
- had a hat which was too large for-  
1- him;  so, to make it fit he put some
white wool in it.  
-  2. Charles wore the hat to school, ~
eJ and hung it on a peg in the hlall; but  
g the wool stuck fast to lhis head.
- to laugh;  and  le thought it was
~* because he came so late.
4. When the teacher saw the wool
on his head, he said: "Why, Charles,  
where did you get your white wig?"
