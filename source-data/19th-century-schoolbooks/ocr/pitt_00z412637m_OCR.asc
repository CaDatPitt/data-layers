POTTER 84 PUTNAM,

INTRODUCTORY.

To secure the best results in vertical penmanship the first work of
the child should be in this form, and /46 57202515! Kmow 720 02‘/2675.

This little book presents vertical writing in connection with the
first steps in reading, sothat the childimay associate with and continu.
ally use this form. The following are the chief points of merit of the
book:

I. A vocabulary of no words common to all the best primers of
the day, so that the book prepares for any of the regular readers in use.

2. An easy and careful gradation of the reading text. i.The sen-
tences are short and strong. I I I

3. .All the script is vertical.

4. All words are developed in script, andthe ﬁrst reading lessons
are in script. These script reading lessons occupy the left hand pages
throughout the book, and each word ‘is reviewed as many times as
possible. In the review lessons, each word ‘developed since last review
is used one or more times. In the last reviews arefound all of the
fro words developed in the book. ' I . . I

5. The transition pages are a special‘ feature of the book. On the
right hand pages are lessons in script and print which correspond in
vocabularyto the script lessons opposite. This plan enables the
teacher to follow the “sc7*z'pz"’ or the “(l»’0Zl5/6’ 7/occzbzz/(W3/” method.
She may either carry the work through on the left hand pages in
script, and then return for the transition to print on the right hand

pages, or she may take the work page‘ by page. In either case the

work is equally effective, and the transition from script to print will be
surprisingly easy.  

At theconclusion of the work in this book, the pupil will be able

. to take up any ordinary first reader,and proceed with a rapidity that
~ cannot be secured by any other method; at the same time he has learned

towrite a hand which will form the basis of a good, strongyhandwriting

* in the higher grades.
