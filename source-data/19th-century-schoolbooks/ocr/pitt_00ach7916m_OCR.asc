PREFACE.

THE experience of more than a quarter of a cen-
tury in the school-room has only strengthened the
belief, that the more a child is interested in any
task, the faster he will learn.

Worcls may paint a scene, or an action, to the full
conception of a matured mind; but a child needs
the actual representation before his eyes to make a
distinct, true, and vivid impression.

In this Primer, ‘therefore, the aid of PICTURES has
been called in, at every step, to illustrate fully the
meaning of the entire text, as well as of individual
words.

Thus, the child is, at the outset, taught, by ob-
jects set before his eye, to look for meaning in
single words and thought in language; and just
so far as he understands, he will be_ interested.

No time is here to be wasted in fruitless experi-
ment on some exploded theory, boldly set forth as a
new discovery. The book is merely and strictly as
it purports to be,—— progressive. The child is called
upon to learn words of two or three letters first;
then those of more than two or three. It thus
accords with the other books of the Progressive
Series already before the public.

Each reading exercise is followed by words
arranged for a spelling lesson; and these, on the
first few pages, are in larger type. Thus the pupil
learns to spell more than six hundred words besides
those in the reading lessons. T 

The true teacher, it is hoped», will recognrisee"'i.n
