‘ Let me entreat you then, my dear ‘kinsman,

‘for your family’s sake, for your own sake, before

it be too late, to reﬂect as you ought upon the
course you ‘ have entered into. By applying
yourself to books instead of suclrvain company,
you will be qualified in "time fortthe best of_com-
pany, and be respected by all ranks of men.
This will keep you out of unnecessary expenses,
will employ all your leisure time, will exclude a_
world of temptations, and ﬁnally set you above
that-wretched companywhich now you seem so
muchdelighted with. And one thing let me
recommend to you, that youlkeep a list of the

observe What fate. Will attend them _: See if those
who follow not the course you, have. so lately

I_ am very sorry, my dear Sammy, -to hear
that your master and you do not agree so well as
I could wish. I was always afraid you would ex-
pect the same indulgence whenyou got abroad in-
to the world, as you experienced when atvhome.
You know, that in many ‘instances, Ihave endea-
voured to make seeming hardships as easy to
you as I could ; but if this makes you more diﬁ‘i-
cult to be satisﬁed, it would be a great trouble to
me. Your Uncle tells me, I am afraid with too
much truth, that the indulgencies you have receiv-
ed from me, have ‘made. your present situation

more disagreeable than it would otherwise have:

been. Whatever I have donefor yo_u, was al-
ways intended for your good, and nothing could
so deeply afflict me, as"t_.o see my tenderness have
a mischievous eﬁ"ect. _Therefore, my dear child,
to my-constant care for you, do not add the sor-
row of my seeing it the cause of your behaving
worse, than if I had been less tender ‘to you.

DEAR CHILD, I y l
. Although we». are separated in person’, yet

1 you are never absent from mythoughts, and it

is my continual practice to recommend you to
the care of that Being, whose eyes ‘are on all his
creatures, and to whom the secrets of all hearts

are open: But I have. been lately somewhat,
  alarmed, because your two last letters do not run
in that strain of vunaﬁ'ected.piety as formerly;
iWhat, my dear, is this owing to? , Does virtue

appear to_ you as unpleasant’! Is yo_ur'beneﬁ.
eentCreator a hard master, or are you resolved
to embark in the fashionable follies of the gay

_i and unthinkingyworld? Excuse me, my dear, I

am a mother, and a concern for your happiness

is inseparably connected with my own. Perhaps

I mistake, -and what I have considered as a

fault, may be only the effusions of youthful gaiety,

108 I LETTER WRI'l_‘ER.

I shall consider it in that light, and be extremely
glad, yea, happy, to ﬁnd it so. Useful instruc-

tions are never too oftenainculcated, and, there-

fore, give me leave again to put you in mind of
that duty, the performance of which alone can
make you happy, both in time and in eternity.

Religion, my» dear, is apdedication "of the‘

whole heart to the will of God, and virtue is the
actual operation of that truth, which ditiuses it-
self through every part of our conduct: Its con-
sequences are equ_ally beneﬁcialas its promises:
“Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all
her paths are peace.” Whils,t the gay, unthink-
ing part of youth are devoting the whole of their
time to fashionable pleasures, how happy should
I be to hearthat my child was religious without
hypocritical austerity, and evenitgay with inno-

cence. Let me beg that you will spend atleast
one hour each day in perusing your Bible, and

some of ourbest English writers, and don’t imag-
ine that religion is such a gloomy thing as some
enthusiasts have represented. No, it indulges

you in every rational and worthy amusement, so

far as it is consistent with morality; it forbids
nothing but What is hurtful.’  y I

HONOURED MADAM,

. I am so much affected by the perusal of your
really parental advice, that I can scarcely hold
the pen to write an answer: but duty to the best

of parents, obliges me to make yo_u easy in your-

true to be denied, nor do I desire to draw a veil
over my own folly; No, madam, I freely confess
it ; but with the greatest sincerity I must at‘ the
same time declare, that they were written in a
careless manner, without considering the charac-
ter of the person‘ to whom theywcre addressed.

‘I am fully sensible of my error, and on all future ‘

occasions shall endeavour to avoid giving the-

least offence. * The counsels you sent me in
your valuable letter, wants no“ encommm; all
that I desire is to have them engraven on my

heart. My dear madam, I love religion, I love. i

virtue, and I hope no consideration will ever lead
me from those duties, in which alone I expect fu-

ture happiness. Let me beg to hear from you‘.

well. My master and mistress are both worthy
people, and greatly respected by all their neigh-
bours. ‘ At my ﬁrst coming there I thought eve-

your good. If you continue‘ virtuous and-oblig-e

ing‘,- all the family will ‘loveand esteem you.

and be always ready to assist your'fellow ser-' .

vants. Never speak ill of any body; butwhen
you hear a bad story, try to soften it as much as
you can : don’t repeat it again, butlet it slip out
of your mind as soon as possible. I am in great
hope that all the family are kind to you, from
the good character I have heard of them. If
you ha_ve any time to spare from your business,
I hope you will spend some part of it in reading

your Bible, and other religious books. Ipray

for you daily, and there is nothing I desire more
than my dear child’s happiness. -Remember
that the more faithful you are to the discharge
of your duty as a servant, the better you will
prosper if you live to have a family of your own.
Your father‘ desires his blessing, and your
brothers and sisters, their kind love to you.
Heaven bless you, iny dear. child; and continue

well; for your ownsake as for your late father’s
and mother’s, makes me give you the trouble’ of
these lines, which I hope you will receive as
kindly as I intend them. I .

I have’ lately called uponyou several times,
and have as often found you inan extraordinary

xhurryg vvhichI well know cannot be sometimes
_ avoided; but perhaps needvnot be always the

case, if your time were disposed in regular and
proper proportions to your business.’ I have

frequently had reason to believe, that more than u

half the ﬂutter, which appears among traders in

- general, is rather the effect of their indolence,
I than of their industry, however willing they are

to have it thought otherwise; and I will give you
one instance in conﬁrmation of this opinion in a
neighbour of mine.

This gentleman carried on for some years at
I wproﬁtable business: but indulging himself every
« evening in a tavern society or club, which the

promotion of business (as is usually the case) gave
the ﬁrst pretence for, he looked upon those en-
gagements as the natural consequence of the ap-
proach of "night; and drove on his business in the
day with pre‘cipit‘ation,' that he might get thither
with the "earliest. He seldom kept‘: very late
hours, though he never camehome soon. The
night being gone, and his bottle emptied, ii the
morning was always Wanted to dispel the fumes

of the wine. Whoever therefore came to him »

before nine, was desired to call again; and

_ when he rose, so many matters waited for him,

as directly threw him into a ‘ﬂutter: so that
from his rising until, dinner time, he seemed in

one continued ‘ferment. A long dinner time he al~_

’ ON RELATIONSHIP. 113

ways allowed himself, in order to recover the fa-

tigues he had undergone’; and all his table talk, -

was how heavy his business‘ lay upon him ! and
What pains he tookiin it ! ’The hearty meal, and
the time he indulged himself at table, begat a

disinelination for any more business for that short in

afternoon; so all that could 'beideferred,iwas put
off to the next morning; and longing for even-
ing’s ‘approach, he—ﬂi-es to his usual solace;

empties his bottle by eleven ; comes home ; gets-
to bed; and is invisible till next morning at nine ; i

and then rising, enters upon his usual hurry and
confusion. » - g - -

, Thus did his life seem to those who saw him
in his business, one constant scene of fatigue,
though he scarce ever applied to it four regular
hours in any one day. ~ ‘Whereas had he risen
only at seven in the morning, he would have got
all his business under by noon ; and those two

hours from seven to nine,‘ being before many‘

people go abroad,’ he would have met with no
interruption in his affairs; but might have im-
proved his servants by his own example, directed
them in the businessof the day, have inspected

his books, Written to his dealers,.and put every

thing in so regular atrain, for the rest of the day,

that whatever had occurred afterwards, would

rather have served to divert than to fatigue him.
And what, to cut my story short, was the sub-

stance of the matter ? VVhy meeting with some

disappointments andlosses (as all traders must ex-
pect, and ought to provide for) and his customers
not seeing him in his store so much as’ they ex-

’ pected, and when there, always in a disobliging,
-petulant ‘hurry; and moreover, mistakes fre-

quently happening through the hurry into which
he put ‘himself and every one about him ; by
these. means his business dwindled away‘ insensi-
bly, and not being able to go out of his usual
course, which helped to imp air both his capacity
and ardour in his business, his creditors. began

' to examine him, a11d he was compelled to ren-

der in a statement of his affairs ; and then had

i the mortiﬁcationto find a balance of 2000 dol-

lars against him. ,_ p .

This was a shocking, case to himself,‘ but
worse to his»fam_i-ly; for his wife had lived, and
his children had been educated inisuch a man-
ner, as induced“'th.emrto hope their fortunes would

_be suﬂicient to place them in a state of inde-

pendence. -

‘In short, being obliged to quit a business he
had managed with so little prudence, his friends
got him. .upon'a'charitable foundation,’ which af-
forded him bare subsistence for himself; his chil-

dren were dispersed some one way and some ,

another,‘ into low scenes of life, and his wife
went home to her friends to be snubbed and re-
ﬂected on by her own family, for faults‘. not her
OWE.‘ t 0 t

This‘ example will afford several good hints to
a young tradesman, which are too obvious to need
expatiating upon ; and as, I dare say, your pru-

.de"nce will keep you from the like fault, you will
"never have reason to reproach yourself on this
score. But yet, as I always found you in a-
hurry, wh_en I called upon you, I could not but

give you this hint, for fear you should not right-
ly proportion your time to your business, and lest,
you should suspend to the next hour, what you

not keep your business properly under. " Method
is every thing i-n business, next, to diligence.

DEAR JEMMY,

You cannot imagine What a concern your
carelessness and indifferent management of your
affairs give me. ‘ Remissness is inexcusable in
all men, but in none so much as in a man of busi-

ness, the soul of which is industry, diligence and"

punctuality. - - _
Let me beg you _to shake off the idle habits

you havecontracted; quit unproﬁtable company,"

and unseasonable r.ecrea‘ti,ons, and apply to your
compting house with diligence. It may not yet
be too late to retrieve your affairs. Inspect there»

fore your gains, and cast up what proportion they

bear to your expenses; and then see which of

116 LE'1"I‘ER w_R1'rER.

the latter you can, and which you cannot contract.

Consider, that when once a man suﬁ"ers himself.
to go backward in the World, it must be an un—,

common spirit of industry that retrieves him, and

puts him forward again.

Reflect, I beseech you, before it be too late,

upon theinconveniences which an’. impoverished

trader is put to, for ‘the remainder of his life ;
which too, may happen to be the prime part of
it ; the indignities he is likely to suﬁer from those
Whose money he has unthinkingly squandered ;
the contempt he will meet with from all,‘ not ex-
cepting the idle companions of his folly ; the in-—
justice he does his family, in depriving his chil-

changing my own condition, purely for your

that the moment a young "fellow throws himself
in your way, you have nothing else to do, but to
give me notice to provide a fortune for you’! and
that you intend tobe of no further‘ use and ser-
vice to me? I This, in plain English, is the mean-

three or four years to come. For consider, Sally,
you are not fully sixteen years of age; and a

husband’s esteem, though it often is enough to

A attract a lover’s notice.

thought you "as yet not quite capable to manage

for her fault. She is very sensible of that, and
sorry she has offended you ; but has great hopes
that Mr. Robinson will prove such a careful and

DEAR NANCY,

You must" believe that your sister’s unadvi-=1
sed marriage, which she must know would be dis-
agreeable to me, gives me no small concern ; and
yet I will assure you that it arises more from my
affection for her, than any other consideration.
In her education I took all the pains and care my
circumstances would admit, and often ‘ﬂattered
myself with the hope that the happy fruits of it
would be made to» appear in ‘her prudent conduct.
What she has now done is not vicious, but indis-

- creet; you must remember, that [have often de-
I clared in her hearing, that the wild assertion of

a rake making a good husband, was the most
dangerous opinion a young woman could imbibe.

I will not however, in pity to her, point out ‘

the many ills I am 'afraid willattend her rashness,
because it is done, and cannot be helped; but
wish she may be happier than I ever saw a wo-
man who leaped so fatal a precipice.

ute to her advantage; and that as he was a stra'n--
ger so me, I should choose to know how he de-
served it,«before he had the power over what I
intended for her. He bit his lip, and with a
hasty step was my humble servant. ' '
Tell the rash girl I would not have her toﬁbe

comforts his companions, when, after the hor-
rors of a storm, they have landed on _an un-
known and desolate country, with the hope that
their miseries will at some distant period, be re-
counted with delight. i There are, perhaps, few
higher gratiﬁcations than that of reﬂection on
evils surmounted, when they were not incurred

by our own fault, and neither reproach us with

cowardice or guilt.

But this kind, of felicity is always abated by
the reﬂection, that they with whom we should
he most pleased to share it, are now in the
grave. _ A few ‘years make such havoc among
the human race, that we soon see ourselves de-
prived’ of those, with whom we entered the

supplied the want of inheritance, when he sits

down to enjoy his fortune, repines in solitary‘

whose merit, -after a long series of efforts, rais-

his exalted state, for his old friends, to be wit-
nesses of his long-sought-for aﬂiuence, and to
partake of his bounty. ' -

Such is the imperfection of all human happi-

ness ; and every period of life is obliged to bor-

row its enjoyments from the time to come. In
youth we have nothing past to entertain us ; and
in age we derive nothing from the retrospect but

fruitless sorrow. The lossof our- friends and ~

companions impresses hourly upon us the neces-
sity of ourown departure. ‘We ﬁnd that all our
schemes are quickly at an end, and that we must
lie down in the grave with the - forgotten. multi-

Can it therefore be be suggested, that beings

‘have any share ; beings that are never satisﬁed

labyrinths and hidden recesses of nature ; I say,
can it be imagined, that such beings should be
deprived of all existence, in the midst of these
growing speculations, which can have no origin

but what is truly‘ divine ? Its fulness must be in

an hereafter. Our very imagination reaches to

eternity, in spite of all that can t be said by the; ‘
most obstinate atheist, or that our own doubts f

can devise. Hope is a constant instinct which
inspires men with a desire of ﬁnding some bet-_
ter state, and is a sure presage of futurity; nor

could any -man on earth be possessed of it, if

that state were not certain, no more than he
would shrink at committing a wicked -act, if
there were no power within himself that is to

-live hereafter. Another strong proof of the im-

mortality of the soul ﬂows from the infallible
goodness and justice of the Divine Being; ‘for if
it were ‘not immortal, and ever conscious of good

powerful argument against repeating the crime.

But as none of us are inclined to think _ill of

which they meet not with from any but our-
selves.   ‘

This is the case of all: it is “particularly so
with drnn-kards : Many of whom their shame
would undoubtedly reform, could they be brought
to conceive how much they do of which ‘they

Nor is it improbable that it is the very con-

to make a man the contempt of his wife, his chil-

the reproach of our English ancestors, we ﬁnd
in Camden’s annals. Under the year 1581, he
has this observation :--——“‘The English, wlmt
hitherto had, of all the northern “nations, shown
themselves the least‘ addicted to immoderate
drinking, and been commended for their sobriety,

. , ﬁrst learned in these wars in the Netherlands, to
,. swallow a large quantity of intoxicating liquor,

and to destroy their own health by drinking that

dually undermines the strength and vigour both

Real and sincere love is modest and timid,
and every young woman may lay downithis as
a certain rule,'that no man who really wishes to

‘ make a wife of them will ever attempt to take

the least indecent liberties with them, nor‘. ask
for an ‘improper favour, under promise of mar-
riage at a more convenient time. . The moment
a man'°attempts any thing of this kind, the prudent
girl will ﬂy instantly from him, and ever after
shun him as she would a plague, "pestilence-, and

Were young Women properly to consider how
important and how diﬂicult the proper choice
of a ‘husband is, we should not hear the com-
plaints of so many ‘unhappy couples.’ But, the
misfortune is, they marry ﬁrst, and think it will
be time enough to consider afterwards; and
hence it is that so many complain all the rest of  
their lives, and look back with regret and horror
on that day in which they quittedservice, to em-
bark in a state of married slavery. ,1

There is another, and a very important con-

most in your mind before you venture to take a

DEAR DAUGHTERS, .

The luxury and dissipation that prevail in
genteel life, as it corrupts the heart in many re»
spects, so it renders it incapable of Warm, sincere,
and steady friendship. A happy choice of friends
Willbeo of the utmost consequence to you, as
theyhmay assist; you by their advice and good
offices. But the immediate gratiﬁcation, which
friendship affords to a Warm, open, andingenuous
heart, is of itself a sufhcient motive to court it.
In thechoice of your friends, have your princi~

pal regard to ‘goodness of heart and ﬁdelity. If '

they‘ also possess taste and genius, that will still
make them more agreeable and useful compan-
ions. ‘ You have particular reason to place con«-

_ﬁdence inethose who have shown ‘aﬂlection for

you in your early days, when you were incapable
of making them any return. This is an'obliga-

tion for which you cannot be too grateful. If

you have the good fortune to meet with any who
deserve the name oflfriends, iiiibosomyourself
with the utmost confidence." It is one of the
World’s maxims never to trust any person with a

dence, will make you’ on the whole, much, hap-
pier than a .reserved, suspicious one, although
you may sometimes suﬂ'er- bylit. Coldness and
distrust are two certain consequences of age
and experience ;»-but they are unpleasant feelings,
and need not be anticipated before.their time. I
But however open you may be in talking of

your own a1"f'airs, never discover the secrets of

one friend to another. These are sacred depos-

ites, which do not belong to you, nor have r you

any right to make use of them. 5 i
There is another case in which I suspect it is

proper to be secret, not so much from motivesof

prudence as delicacy ,;’ I mean in love matters.
Though awoman has -no reason to be ashamed

of an attachment to a man of merit, yeti nature, I

Whose. authority is -superior to philosophy, has
annexed a sense of shame toﬂit. It is even long

before a woman of ‘delicacy, dares avow to her

own heart that she loves ; and when all the sub-
terfuges of ingenuity to conceal it from herself’
fail, she feels, violence done both to her pride and
to her modesty‘. This, I should imagine, must

’ be always’ the case where she is not sure. of a

return for her attachment. In such a situation,

tolay the heart open to any person whatever, I

does not appear to me consistent with the per-
fection of female delicacy. ."But perhaps I am
in the wrong. At the same timeI must. tell you,
that in point of prudence, it concerns you to at-
tend well to the consequences of such a discov-
ery. These secrets, however important in your
own estimation, may appear very triﬂing to your‘
friend,who possibly will not enter into your feel-
ings, but may rather consider them as a subject

i ON RELATIONSHIP. , 149

of°pleasantry. Forlthis reason, love secrets
are of all others the worst kept. But the
concequences to youmay be very serious, as no
man of spirit and delicacy ever' valued a heart
haclineyed in the Ways of love. If, therefore,
you must have a friend to pour out your heart
to, be sure of her honour and secresy. Let her

notbe a m'arried woman, especially if she lives v

happily with her husband. ‘There are certain
unguarded moments in which such a woman,

though the best and ' worthiest of her sex, may

let hints escape, which, at other times, or to‘ any
other/. person than her husband, she would be in~
capable of; nor will a husband, in this case, feel

himself under theisame obligations of secresy '

and honour, as if you ‘had put your conﬁdence

originally, in himself, especially on a subject
vvhich the world is apt to treat so lightly.

If all other circumstances are equal, there are
obvious advantages in your making friends of
your:ubrothe1's and sisters. The ties of blood,

andi'\your_ being so much united in one common '

interest, form an additional bond of union to your
friendship. If your brotlrer/sAsh{>uld have the
good ‘fortune to have hearts susceptible of friend-

ship, to possess truth, lionour, sense, and delicacy -
of sentiment, they are the fitest and most unex-==i_

ceptionableaconﬁdants. By placing conﬁdence
in them, you will receive every advantage which
you could hope for from the friendship of men,

without any of the inconveniences‘ that attend ‘

such connexions with our sex.

Men of this sort will atttendyou to public places,

well understand, or have not leisurelto regard, or
perhaps are too proud to submit to.’ Look on
the compliments of such men as words of course.
which they repeat to every agreeable woman ‘of’

are apt to assume, which a proper dignity‘ in your
behaviour will be easily able to check. ' «
There is a different species of men, whom you
may like as agreeable companions, men of Worth,
taste, and genius, Whose conversation, in some
respects, may be_ superior to What you generally
meet with among those of your own sex. Lltwill
be foolish in you to deprive yourself of an useful
and agreeable acquaintance merely because idle
people say he is your lover. Such a man may
like yourrcqnipany, Without having‘ any design
upon your person. People whose sentiments,

and particularly Whose tasteicorrespond, natur- '

ally like to associate ‘together, although neither
of them have the most‘ distant View of any further
connexion. But, as this similarity of minds often

oN RELATIONSHIP. 153

gives rise to a more tender attachment than a

friendship, it. will be proper to keep a watchful

eye over yourselves, lest your hearts become too 1

far engaged before you are aware of it.

At the same time, I do not think that your sex,
at leastyin this part of the World‘, have much of
that sensibility, which disposes to such attach-
ments. What is commonly called love among
you is rather gratitude, and the partiality to the

man who-prefers you to the rest of your sex_;. i

and such a man you often marry, with little
either of personal esteem or affection. Indeed,
without any unusual share of natural sensibility,
and a very. peculiar good , fortune, a woman in
this country has very little probability of marry-
ing for love. It is a maxim laid down among you,

and a very prudent oneitris, that love is t not to ,

begin on your part, but is entirely to be the con-
sequence of our attachment to you. Now, sup-
posing a woman to have sense and taste, she will
not ﬁnd many men to whom she can possibly be
supposed to bear any considerable share of es-

teem. Among these few, it is a very great

chance if any of them distinguishes her particu-
larly.   Love, at least with us, is exceedingly ca-
pricious, and will not always ﬁx where reason
says it should. j But supposing i one of ‘them
should become particularly attached to her, it is

still extremely improbable that he should bethe
. man in the world her heart most approved of.

As, therefore, nature has not givenyou that
unlimited range in your choice which we enjoy,
she has wisely and benevolently assigned to you
a greater ﬂexibility of taste on this subject.
Some agreeable qualities recommend a gentle-

154 i LETTER warran.

man to good liking and friendship. In the course of
his acquaintance he contracts an attachment to you.
Whell you perceive it, it excites your gratitude ;
this gratitude rises into a preference, and this
preference perhaps at last advances to some de-
gree ‘of attachment, especially if it meets with
crosses and difficulties ; for these and a. state of

, suspense, are very great" incitements to attach-

ment, and are the food of love" in both sexes.
If attachrnentvvas not excited in your sex in this

a manner, there is not one in a million of you that

would ever marry with any degree of love. A

man of taste and delicacy rnarries a worhan, be- ,.

cause he loves her more than any other. A
woman of equal taste and delicacy ‘marries him
because she esteems him, and because he gives
her that preference._ But, if a man uni'ortu.nat_e-=

sometimes affect pleasantry, but it sits awkward-

DEAR DAUGHTERS,

In my last, I laid ‘before you my thoughts r

on love and friendship, and now proceed to con-

. sider some other particulars very. essential to T

your happiness. If you see evident proofs of a
gentleman’s attachment,’ and are determined to
shut your heart against him, as you ever hope to
be used with generosity by the person who shall
engage your own heart,’ treat him honourably and
humanely. Do not let him linger in a miserable
suspense, but be anxious to let him know your
sentiments with regard to ‘him. ‘

ON RELATIONSHIP. 157

However people’s hearts may deceive them,

there is scarcely a person that can love for any
time, without at least some distant hope of sues-

vcess. If you reallywish to undeceive a lover,

you may do it in a variety of ways: There is a
certain species of familiarity in your behaviour,
which may satisfy him, if he has any discern-
ment left, that he has nothing to hope for. But-

perhaps your particular tempermay not permit .

of this.»-—You may easily show that you want to
avoid his company; but if he is a man whose
friendship you wish -to preserve, you. may not

‘choose this method, because then you lose him

in every capacity. You may get a common
friend to explain matterspto him or fall on many
other devices, if you are seriously anxious to
put him out of suspense. p

But, if you. are resolved against every such
method, at least, do not shun opportunities of
letting him explain himself. If you do this, you
act barbarously and unjustly. If he bringsyou
to an explanation, give him a polite, but resolute
and decisive answer. In whatever way, you
convey you-r sentiments to him, if he is a; man
of spirit and delicacy, he will give you no far-
ther trouble, nor apply to your friends for their
intercession. This last is a method of courtship

which every man of spirit will disdain. He

never will whine or sue for your pity." That
would mortify almost as much as your scorn. In
short, youmay break such a heart, but you can
never bend it. Great pride always accompanies
delicacy, however concealed under the appear-
ance of the utmost gentleness and modesty ; and

is the passion of all others the most difficult . to

conquer, 4

There is a case where a woman may coquette’-gt

justiﬁab-ly to the utmost verge which her con-r '
science, will allow. /It is where a gentlemanﬁ
purposely declines to make his addresses, till’.

such time as he think himself perfectly sure of
her consent. This at bottom, is intended to

force a woman to give, up the undoubted privi-I V

lege of her sex, the privilege of refusing it ; it is
intended to _force her to explain herself, inef-
fect,-before the gentleman ‘designs-to do it, and-

by this means to oblige ‘her to violate the mod- _
-esty and delicacy of her sex, and to invert the
clearest order of nature. All this sacriﬁce is-

proposed to be made, merely to gratify a most‘
despicable vanity" in a man, who would degrade
the very woman whom he wishes to make his
wife. ' '

It is of great importance to distinguish,,‘Whe»._

ther a gentleman who has the appearanceof

being yourlover, delays to speak explicitly, from ‘
the motive I have mentioned, or from a diﬂidence f

inseparable from the attachment. In the one

case you can scarcely use him too ill; in the .

other,.you ought touse him with great-kindness:
And the greatest kindness you can show him,
if you ‘are determined not to listenuto his rad»
dresses, is to let him know, it as soon as possible.
I know the many excuses with which women
endeavor to justify themselves to the world and
to their own consciences, when they act other-

sometimes they plead the decorum of their "sex,«;
which enjoins an equal behaviour to all men

and forbids them to consider any. man as a lover ,
until he has directly told them so. Perhaps few

women carry their ideas of female delicacy and
decorum so far as«I do. 'But I must say you are
not entitled to plead the obligation of these vir-

tues, in opposition to the superior ones of grati-

tude,f justice, and humanity. I‘he man is enti-

matter is, vanity and the love of admiration is so
prevailing a passion among you, that you may
be considered to make’ a ‘very great sacriﬁce,
Whenever you give up a lover, till after the art of
coquetry fails to keep him, or till he forces you

when you are indifferent to, or even when you .

artful coquetry is employed by Women of supe- ,

rior taste and sense, to engage and ﬁx the heart
of a man, whom the World and whom they them-

can sometimes be gratiﬁed with the utter ‘ruin of
his fortune, fame and happiness. I am very cer-

worthless vanity I have been speaking of.

at the. same time to possess that acute discern- A
-ment, whichmay secure you against being de-

Male coquetry is much more inexcusable than

-female, as well as more pernicious; but it is

rarein this country. Very few,/._men will give
themselves the trouble to gain or. retain any wo-
man’s affections unless‘ they haveviews in them
either of an honourable or dishonourable kind.
Men employed in the pursuits of business, ambi-s
..tion, or pleasure, will not give themselves the
trouble to engage a woman’s aﬁ°ections,<merely
from the vanity of conquest, and of triumphing

over the heart of an innocent and defenceless

girl. Besides, people never value much what
is entirely in their power. A man of parts,
sentiment, and address, if he lays aside: all re-
gard to_ truth and humanity, may engage the
hearts of ﬁfty women at thesame time ;_ and may
likewise conduct his coquetry with so much art,
as to put it out of the power of any of them to
specify a single expression that couldbe said di-
rectly expressive of-' love. .- This ambiguity of

‘behaviour, this art of keeping one in suspeH_se',»

DEAR DAUGHTER_3,

You may perhaps imagine, -that the reserved
behaviour which I recommend to you, and your
appearing; seldom at public places, must cut
off all opportunities of your being acquainted
with gentlemen. I. am very far from intendin
this-; I advise you to no. reserve but what ‘will
render youmore respectcdiaiid beloved“ by our

_ON RELATIONSHIP. I 1&5 A

sex. I do not think ipublicplaces suited tomake

people acquainted together. They can only be ,
distinguished there by their looks ‘and external r
behaviour. But it is in private companies alone

where you can expect easy and agreeable eon-
versation, which I shall never wish you to de-

cline. If you do not allow gentlemen to become

acquainted with you, you can. never expect to
marry with attachment on y'ei_tl1er;side.——Loveis

. very seldom produced at ﬁrst sight; at least it

must have, in that case, a very unjustifiable foun-
dation. True love is founded on esteem, in a

correspondence of tastes and sentiments, and A

steals on the heart imperceptibly.
There. is one advice I shall leave» you, to
which I beg your -particular‘ attention. Before

your aﬁections come to be in_the least engaged‘

to any man, examine your tempers, your tastes,
and your hearts very severely; and settle in

your own minds what are the requisites toyour

happiness in a married state ; and as itis almost,
impossible that you should get every thing to your
wish, come to a steady ‘determination what you
are to consider as essential; and What may be
sacriﬁced. 1 - -

If you have hearts disposed by nature forlove
and friendship, andpossess those feelings which
enable you to enter into all the reﬁnements and
delicacies of these attachments,consider well for
your own sake, and as you value your future hep-4
piness, before you give themany indulgence. lf
you have the misfortune ( for avery great misfor-
tune it commonly is to your sex) to have such a
temper and such sentiments deeply rooted in you ;

if you have spirit and resolution to resist the so- .

licitations of vanity, the. persecution of friends,

I (you will have lost the only, friend that would nev-

er persecute you) and can support the prospect
of the many inconveniences attending the state
of an old maid, which.I formerly pointed out;

then you may indulge yourself in that kind of”
sentimental reading and conversation, which is ‘

most correspondent to your feelings.
But if you ﬁnd, on a strict self examination,

that marriage is absolutely essential to your hap- A
,, piuess, keep the secret inviolable in your own
bosoms, for the reasons I formerly mentioned’:

but shun, as you would the most fatal poison, all.
that species of reading and conversation which

warms‘ the imagination, which engages and soft- /
ens the heart,’ and raises the taste above the level ‘

of common life. If you dorothewise,» consider
the terrible conflicts of passion which this may
afterwards raise in your breasts. ' T -

If this reﬁnement once takes deep root in your
minds, and you do not obey its dictates, but mar-
ry from vulgar and mercenary views, you may
never be able to eradicate it entirely ; and then ’it
will_ embitter all your married days. Instead of
meeting with sense, delicacy, tenderness, a lover,
a friend, an equal comp'anion,in a husband, you
may be tired with insipidity and dulness ; shock-
ed with indelicacy, or mortiﬁed with indifferen‘ce.
You Wlll ﬁnd noneto compassionate or even un-

may not use you cruelly, and may give you as
much money for your clothes,’ personal expen-

of reason. . It may probably, too, hurt your vani-
ty to have husbands for whom you have reason
to blush.’ and tremble, every time they open their

lipsin company, But the Worst circumstance ;

that attends a fool is, his constant jealousy of his
wife’s being thought ‘to govern him. This ren-
ders it impossible to lead him, and he is continu-
ally-doingpabsurd and disagreeable things, for no
other reason but to show he dares to do them.’
A rake is always a suspicious "husband, because
he has only known the most worthless of your
sex. He likewise entails the worst diseases on
his wife and children, if he has the misfortune to
have any. , l '
g If you have a sense of religion yourselves, do
not think of husbands who have none. If they
have tolerable understanding, they will be glad

that you have religion, for their own sake, and

forthe sake of their families. If they are weak’
men, they will be continually teazing and shock-

ing you about your principles, ‘If you have

children, you will suffer the most bitter distress,
in seeing all your endeavours to form their ‘minds
tovirtue and piety, all your endeavours to se-
cure their present and eternal happiness, frus-
trated and turned into ridicule. _ ~-

, RULES FOR COMPOSITION.

r .;»s@a««.
Of the Method of attaining algood”;S'tyle.
, To pretend to teach the art of ﬁne writing by

a series of mechanical rules, would be highly
absurd. The young student may, however, be

assisted by a few plain directions concerning the a
proper method of attaining a style correct and

elegant. . .

In the ﬁrst place, we ought always to‘ endeavour”

to obtain-a clear and precise idea of every sub-
ject of which we purpose to treat. This is a di-
rection, which may at first appear to have little
relation to style. Its relation to ‘it, however, is
extremely close. The foundation of ﬁne writing
is good sense accompanied with a lively imagi-T

nation. . The style and thoughts of a writer are 4

so intimatelyaconnected, that it is frequently a
difficult task to- distinguishwhat depends upon
the one, and what upon the other. Whenever
thetimpressions of objects upon the'~mind are
faint and indistinct, or, perplexed and confused,
our stylein treating of such -objects can never

xxii i -tvmncrzons For.

he luminous‘ or beautiful. Whereas, what we
conceive clearly and feel strongly, we shall nat-
ura.lly express with clearness and with strength.
This, then, we may be assured, is an important
rule, to think closely of thesubject," till we have

attained a full and distinct ,view of the matter

which we are to clothe in words, till we become
warm and interested in it : then, and not till then,
shall we ﬁndexpression begin to ﬂow-. ‘Gener-
ally speaking, the best and most proper expres-
sions are those which a clear view of the subject
suggests, without much labour or inquiry.

In the second place, to form a good style, the
frequent_practice of composing is indispensably
necessary. ‘Many rules concerning style have
been delivered; but no rules will answer the end
without exercise and habit. At the same time,
it is not’ every mode of composing that will im-

‘ prove style. This is so far from being the case,

that by careless and hasty composition, we shall
inevitably acquire a very bad style ; we shall
have more trouble afterwards in unlearning faults
and correcting negligences, than if we had been
totally" unaccustomed to composition._ At ﬁrst,

therefore, we ought to write slowlyand with

much care. ‘Let the facility andspeed of writing
be the fruit of longer practice. ’ V p .

. “ I enjoin,” says Quintilian, “that such as
are beginning the practice _of composition,-write

slowly“ and ' with anxious deliberation. Their-

great object atﬁrst should be, to write as well
as possible: practice will enable . them to write"
speedily. By degrees, matter will oifer itself
still more readily : words will be at hand ;' com-

LETTER WRITING. s xxiii

position will ﬂow ;i every thing, as in/the arrange-
ment of a wellordered‘ family, will present itself

in its proper place. The sum of the whole is,
e this; that by hasty compostion, we shall never

acquirethe art of composing well; by writing
welI,.we, shall come to write speedily.” _
‘W e must not, however, be too anxious about

words : we must not retard the course of e thought,“

nor cool theheat of imagination, by pausing too
long’on,every word which vveemploy. . There
is, on‘ certain occasions, a glow of composition
which should be kept up, if we hope to express
ourselves happily, though at the expense of al-
lowing some inadvertencies to "pass. These

' must afterwards be scrutinized with a critical .

eye. If the practice‘ of composition be useful,

.. the laborious work of correcting is no less so;

it is absolutely necessary to our reaping any ben-
efit from the habit of composing. What we have

written, should be laid aside till the ardour of 

composition be ‘past, till our fondness for the ex-
pressions which we have used, be worn off, and
the expressions themselves, beforgotten.  By re-
viewing our work with a cool and critical eye,
as  it were-the performance of another, We shall

‘discern many imperfections, which at first escaped

-our observation. It is then the season for prun-
ing. redundancies ; for exarnining the ‘arrange-
ment of sentances; and for bringing style into a

gr,egul_ar, correct, and ;su,ppo_r'ted form. To this

.labour of correction‘al1 those must submit, who
would ‘communicate their thoughts to others with
proper advantage ; and sofnel practise in it will
soon sharpen the eye to the most necessary ob-

jtxiv g DIRECTIONS rm:

jects of attention, and render the task much, more /

easy and practicable than might at ﬁrst be im-
agined. . ‘

’ In the r/iird place, with respect to the assis-
tance which is to be derived from the writings of
others, it is obvious, that we ought. to render our-
selves well acquainted with the style of the best

- authors. This is requisite both to form‘ a just

taste in style, and to supply us with a full stock
of words on every subject... ,

In the fourth place, we must beware of falling
into a servile imitation. of any author whatsoever.
Imitation is always dangerous. It_.fetters.genius’,
and is likely to produce a stiff manner. Those
who are addicted to close im-itati»‘on,genei'ally im-

A itate an author’s faults as well as his; beau‘tiesf.’
i N 0 man will ever become a good writer or speak-
- er, who has not some degree of conﬁdence to

follow his own genius. ,We ought to beware, in
particular, of adopting any autho-r’s noted phrases,
or transcribing passages from "him. Such a hab-
it will prove fatalto all genuine composition. It
is much better to have something thatis our own,
though of moderate beauty, than to -Iaffect to
shine in borrowed ornaments, "which will at last
betray the utter poverty of our genius. I On these
heads of composing, reading, and imitating, I
would advise every student of oratory to consult
,what Quintilian has delivered in the-tenth book

. of his Institutions, where he will ﬁnd a variety of
T excellent observations’ and directions‘.

In_the ﬁftlz place, those, who are ambitiousof

g attaining a beautiful style,ought to’ study with
or attention the works of the -most eminent poets.

LETTER WRITING. xxv

From this source is oftenxderived a more delicate

and elevated mode of expression as Well as of ii

thinking. We ﬁnd that the most excellent prose
writers, both of ancient and modern times, are
those who, during some part of ’ their life, have
applied themselves to the study of poetry. - It

will be suﬂicient to mention the names of Plato,
Cicero, Temple, Dryden, Pope, Addison, Mel- '

and Voltaire. ,

In the simthplace, it is an obvious « but mate-
rial rule, that we always study to adapt our
style to the subject; and also‘ to the capacity of

moth, Johnson, Goldsmith, (Hamilton, Fenelon,

‘our hearers,-ifwe are to speak in public. No-

thing merits the name of eminent or .beauti‘ful,
which is not suited to the occasion, and to the

"persons to Whom it is addressed. Itis to the

last degree awkward and absurd,‘ to adopt a ﬂo-
rid, poetical style on occasions when it should be
our sole business to argue and‘ reason ;* or to speak
with elaborate pomp of expression before persons
who comprehend nothing of it, and who can on-
ly stare at our . unseasonable magniﬁcence.
These are defects not so much in point of style,
as, what is. much worse, in’ point of common
sense. ‘When we begin to Write or speak, we
ought previously to have ﬁxed in our minds. a
clear conception of the end to be aimed at. This

end we ought to keep steadily in view; and to a

it we ought to adapt our. style. If we do not
sacriﬁce to this great object every‘ ill-timed orna-
-ment that may occur to our fancy, we betray a
want of judgment. , y t . 

In the last place, It cannot conclude thersub-t»

‘ject without this observation, that, in anyzcase,

and on any‘occasion,, attention to style must not

expression be attentive; but about your matter,
be solicitous. t i

-:

Of Cleamew and P7‘ecz'sz'0n in the Structure of
Sentences. ‘ '

1. AMBIGUITIES are frequently occasioned by
the improper use of the adverb. This part of
speech, as its name implies, is generally placed
close\ornear to the Word which it modiﬁes or
affects; and" its propriety and force depend on
itsiposition. By neglecting to advert to this
circumstance, Writers frequently convey a differ-
ent meaning from what they intended. J

2. Words expressing things connected in the
thought, should. be placed as near together as
possible. This rule is derived immediately
from the principles of human nature; in which
we may discover a remarkable propensity to

place together objects that are in any manner"
connected. When objects are’ arranged accord- ‘

ing to their connexions, we have a sense of order:

‘when. they are placed fortuitously, wephave a

sense of disorder.
The connective partsof sentences are the

mostirnportant of all, and require the great-.

est care and attention; for it is by these chieﬂy
that the train of y thought, the course_ of reasoning,

LETTER WRITING. V xxvii

and thewhole progress of the mind, incontinued
discourse of all kinds, is laid -open,‘ and on the

right -use of these depends perspicuity, the great- .
.est "beauty of style. '

3. Another great source of ambiguity, is the
too frequent repetition of pronouns, when we

' have occasion to referto different persons.

4..A circumstance ought never to be placed

between two capital members of aperiod; for .

by such an arrangement,,we are ‘left doubtful to
which of the two the circumstance refers. But
when it isvinterjected between parts of the mem-
berto which it properly belongs, the ambiguity
isremoved‘, and these members arekept distinct
from each other. ‘   V e

-Of ‘Unity in the Structure (J sentences.

IN compositions of every description, a certain
degree of unity, is absolutely requisite. There

must always-be some leading principle to form
_a chain of connexion between the component

parts. In single sentences, which are members

‘of a composition, the same principle must also ,

be predominant-. ' ., .

1. Objects that have no intimate connexion
should never be crowded iutoone sentence. A
sentence or period ought to express one entire
thought or mental proposition;_a11d odiffferent
thoughts ought to be separated in theexpression,

by being placed in diﬁ'erent periods. _It is improp‘--A

er toiconnect. in language, things which are sep-

xxviii DIRECTWNS son ,

i arated in reality. The greatest care should he

taken to avoid violations of this rule.

2. Parenthieses ought never to be introduced in A

the middle of sentences’; and indeed the unity
and beauty of a period can never be com-
plete where they are introduced in any situa-

tion.‘ At present, they are not so frequently’

used as they were formerly: and it is to be
hoped, that the time will arrive when they

'shall be entirely, excluded. They are, at

best, nothing more than a perplexed and awk-
ward method of disposing of some thought which

the writer wants art to introduce in its proper

place. I . i

3. Sentences ought never to be extended be-
yond what seems their natural 'close. Every
thing that is one, should have a beginning, a mid-
dle, and an end. It need nothere be observed,

that, according to the laws of rhetoric, an unﬁn-.

ished sentence is no sentence at all. But we
frequently meet with sentences which may be said

to be more than ﬁnished. ‘When We have ar-

rived at what we expected was to be their con-
clusion,“ some circumstance which ought to have
been omitted, or to have been otherwise disposed
of, suddenly presents itself. Such’ appendages
tend to destroy the beauty, and to diminish the
strength of a period.

@-
Of Strength in the Stmcture of Sentences.

1., A sentence ought to be divested of all re-

Ln:'r'rER wrwrrnic. xxix

dundant words. These may sometimes be con-
sistent with perspicuity and unity ; but they are
always ‘irreconcilable with strength. It is an
invariable maxim, that words which add nothing

7 to the sense or to the clearness, must diminish

the force of the expression.

2. A’ sentence ought also to be divested’ oi‘ all‘

redundant members. Every member should pre-
sent a new thought. Yet we sometimes meet
with periods» in which the last member is nothing
more than the echo of the ﬁrst, or a repetition of

. it in a different form. . c » .

3. In constructing a sentence, particular atten-.
tion should bepaid to theuse of copulatives, rel-=
atives, and all the particles employed in transition
and connexion. The gracefulness andstrength
of a period_ must in’ a great measure depend‘ on
words of this description. They are the joints

ane hinges upon which all sentences turn. The

' variousimodes‘ of using them are so numerous,

that no particular rulesrespecting them" can be

~ formed. “We must be directed by an attentive

consideration of the practice of standard writers,

joined with frequent trials of the different effects '
produced by a different application of those par- .

ticles.
What is called splitting of particles, or sep-
arating apreposition from the noun which it gov-
erns, ought always to be avoided. '
4. In arranging a sentence, thernost important
words ought to_ be placed in- that situation in
which they will make the strongest impression.

Every one must perceive, that in all sentences .

there are certain words of superior importance

«PREFACE.

“wen i

Tnalvgreat utilty oflepistolary writing is

so Well known, that the necessity of being
acquainted with an art replete with such

advantages, is needless to be insisted on.

Those, who are accomplished in it, are too

happy in their own knowledge to need far-

ther information concerning its excellence.
And such as are unqualiﬁed to convey their
sentiments to a friend, without the assistance
of a third person, feel their deﬁciency so
severely, that nothing need i be said to
convince them, that it is their interest to
become acquainted with what is so necessary
and agreeable. i _ '   _ ”
 Had letters been known at the beginning
of the world, epistolary writing would have
been as old as love and friendship ; for, as

soon as they began to ﬂourish," the verbal

messengerwas dropped, the language of the
heart was committed to characters that
faithfully preserved it, secresy was main»

xxx   nrnncrioxs iron

and it is equally obvious that those words should.
stand in a‘ conspicuous and distinguished place.

But’ the precise station which they ought to occu- .

py, cannotpbeascertained by any general rule.
Their’ position must vary with the nature of the
sentence. Perspicuity must ever be studied in

'_ the ﬁ'rst place :\’.and the structure of our language

allows no great liberty in the choice of « colloca-
tion; For the most part,. the important Words
are placed at the beginning of the=sent,ence._

'5. Sentences ought never to be concluded with

1 words that make an inconsiderable ﬁgure.‘ Such

conclusions always have the eﬂ"ect of enfeebling
anddegrading. There may indeed be sentences
in which the stress" and signiﬁcanjcy rest chieﬂy
upon adverbs, prepositions, or some other word of
the same kind. In this casethey ought to have
a principal place allotted to them. No objection,
therefore, can be urged against such an arrange-

. ment as ‘appears in this period : “ In their pros-
perity,-my friendsshall never hear of me: in
V their ‘adversity, aZway_,9.” Here the adverb al-

wax;/.s_‘, being an emphatical word, is so placed, as
to make a strong impression.  

6. In the members ofa sentence where two ob-
jects are either compared or’ ,contrasted, some
resemblance in the language and construction
should be preserved. ‘

ALTHOUGH sound is a quality of much less im-

portance that sense,'yet it must notbe altogether
disregarded. For, as sounds _are the vehicle of
our ideas, there must always be a pretty intimate
connexion between the idea which is conveyed,
and the sound which conveys it. Pleasing ideas
can hardly beitransrnitted to the mind by means of
harsh and disagreeable sounds. At these the mind

‘immediately revolts. Nothing can enter into the

affections which stumbles at the. threshold by of-
fending the ear; Music has naturally a great pow.
er over allmien to prompt and facilitate certain
emotions ; insyomuch, that-there are scarcely any

_-dispositions which We wishtto raise in others,’ but

certain sounds may be found concordant to these‘
-dispositions and tending to excite -and promote
them. Language is to acer-tainpdegree, possessed
of the same power.— Not content with simply in-

terpreting our ideas to the hearer, it can commu-_

gnicate ‘them enforced by corresponding sounds;

-and to the pleasure of imparted knowledge, can

add, the new and separatepleasure of melody.
In the harmony of sentences, two things ~ may
be considered ; agreeable sound, or modulation,
in general without any particular expression,’ and
sound so ordered,‘as to ‘become expressive. of

the sense. ~

Let us first consider sound, in general, as the 1

property of a well-constructed sentence. The
musical cadence of a sentence will depend upon
two circumstances :, the choice of words, and the
arrangement of them. ‘ i ~

-‘With regard to the choiceaof words, little can
be said,‘unless we were to descend into a tedi-
ous and frivolous detail concerning the powers

xxxii — DIRECTIONS I§'(')R

of the several letters, or simple sounds, of «which
speechtis composed. It -is evident, that those"
words are most agreeable-to the ear, which are
composed of smooth and liquid sounds, where
there is a proper intermixture of vowels and

consonants,‘ without too many harsh consonants ~

clashing with each other, or too many open vow-
els in sucession, to cause a hiatus or disagreea-
ble aperture of the mouth. It may always be
assumed asa principle, that whatever Words are
difficult in pronunciation, are, in the same ‘pro-
portion, harsh‘ and painful to the ear. Vowels
add softness, consonants strength, tothe sound of

- words. , The melody of language requires a due
‘proportion of both, and will be destroyed ,  an

excess of either. Long Words are commonly
more agreeable to the ‘ear than monosyllables.
They please it by the succession of sounds which
they present :. and accordingly the most musical:
languages possess them in the greatest abun-
dance. Among words oftany length, those are

‘the most musical which do not wholly consist ei-

ther of long or short syllables, but contain a due
intermixture of both. _ _ ‘ .

i The harmony which results from a proper ar-
rangement of the words and members of a period,

a is a more complex subject. Howevernwell cho-

sen and well sounding thewords themselves may
be, yet if they be ill disposed, the musicof the

sentence is utterly lost. In the harmonious ar-. '

rangemeht of his periods, no writer, ancient or
modern, can be brought into competition with

Cicer0- He has studied this with the utmost
care.

d On the. art of introducing Pleasing AZlttst'ons in

composition. BY ,AoDI,soN-_.

The pleasures of the imagination are not

'wholly conﬁned to such particular authors as are

conversantiin material objects,’but are often to be
met with among the polite masters of ‘morality,
criticism, and other speculations abstracted from
matter, who, though they do not directly treat of
the visible parts of nature, often draw from them
their similitudes, metaphors and allegories. By
these allusions, a truth in the understanding is,
as it were, reﬂected by the imagination; we are
able to see" something like colour and shape in
a motion, and to discover a scheme of thoughts
traced out upon matter. And here the mind re-
ceives a great deal of satisfaction, and has two

of its faculties gratiﬁed at the same time, while ,
the fancy is busy in copying after the under-

standing, and transcribing ideas out of the intel-
lectual world into the material. » ’
Theegreat art of a writer shows itself in the

‘choiceof pleasing allusions, which are generally
“to be taken from the great or beautiful works of
art or nature ; for though whatever is new or un-

common is apt to delight the imagination, the
chief design of an allusion being to illustrate and
explain thepassages of an author, it should be
always borrowed from what is more known and
common, than the passages wliich areto. be ex-
plained. , _ « - ,
Allegories, wheniwell chosen, are like so many

xxxiv v nrnnorrporfs non

tracks of light in a discourse, that make every
thing about them clear and beautifulu A ‘noble

metaphor, when it is placed to advantage, casts '

a kind of glory round it and darts a lustre
through a Whole sentence. These different kinds
of allusion are but so many different manners of
similitude-; and, that they "may please the imag-
ination, the likeness ought to be very ,eXact or
very agreeable, as -We love to see-a picture Where
the reseniblance is just, or the posture and _air
graceful. But we often ﬁnd eminent writers very
faulty in this respect : great scholars are apt, to
fetch their comparisons and allusions from the sci-

ences in which they are most conversant, so that a
man may see the compass of their learning in a
treatise on the most indifferent subject. ‘I have‘
-read a7di’scourse upon loVe,iwhich none but a

"profound chemist could understand, and have

»>heard'ma_ny a sermon that should only have

been preached before a congregation of Carte-

~sians.‘” On the contrary, your men of business

usuallyhave recourse to such. instances as are
too mean and familiar. They are foriclrawing
the readerinto a game of chess or tennis, or
for leading him‘ from shop to shop,‘in the cant of
particular trades and employments. It isvcer-
tain, there maybe found an inﬁnite variety of
very" agreeable allusions in both‘ these kinds;
but, for the generality, the m_ost entertaining
ones lie in the Works of nature which are obvi-’
ous to all capacities, and more delightful than
what is to be found in arts and sciences. i

It is this talent of effecting the imagination,‘

thatgives an embellishment to good sense, and

makestone man’s compositions more agreeable

than an‘other’s. It sets off all writings in general,

V but is the very life and highest perfection of poe-‘

try : where it shines in an eminentdegree, it has
preserved several poems for many‘ ages, that
haveenothing else to recommend them ;_ and
where all the other beauties are present, the work
appears dry and insipid, if this single one be want-
ing. ‘ It has something in it "like creation.‘ It
bestows akind of ;existence, and draws up to the
reader’s View severalobjects which are not to be
found in being. It makes additions to nature,
andsgives greater variety to God’s Works. In a
word, it is able to beautify and adorn the most
illustrious scenes in the universe, or to ﬁll the

mind with more glorious shows and _ apparitions”,

than can be found in any7partof it.

A
MINISTERS ADVICE

YOUNGLADY-

u;»@@G«K-

‘Thy winning gracewill lose its power to charm,
Thy smile to vanquish, and thy breast to warm : .
The reign of beauty, like the blooming ﬂower,

Is but the pride and pageant of an hour; _

To-day its sweets perfume the ambient air,
To‘-morrow sees it shrunk, nor longer fair.

Such the extent of all external sway ;

At best, the glory ofa short liv’d day.

Then let the mind your noblest care engage ;

Its beauties last beyond the ﬂight of age :

’ Tis mental charms protract each dying grace,

And renovate the bloom that deck’d the beauteous face»
Let every virtue reign within thy breast,

That Heav’n approves, or makes, its owner blest ;.

To candor, truth, and charity divine,

The modest, decent, lovely virtues join :

Let wit, well tempered, meet with sense reﬁn’d,

And every thought express the polish’d mind ;

A mind above the meanness of deceit ;

Of honour pure-'—_in conscious virtue great ;

In every change that keeps one steady aim,

And feels that joy and virtue are the same.

And 0 ! let prudence o’er each thought preside,

Direct in public, and in private guide ;

Teach thee the snares of artiﬁce to shun,

And know, not feel how others were undone ,-,

A mN1s'rEa’s ADVICE. , xxitvii

Teach thee to tell the ﬂatterer from the friend,
And those who love, from those who but pretend."’
Ah! ne’er let ﬂatt’ry tempt you to believe 5

For man is false, and ﬂatters--to deceive ;
Adores those charms his falsehood would disdain,
And laughs at conﬁdence he strives to gain.

And if delight your bosom e’er would taste, .

O shun the vicious, dread the faithless breast !

Infection breathes, where’er they take their way,

And weeping innocence becomes a prey! .
The slightest blasts,a t'emale’s bliss destroy,
And taint the source of all her sweetest joy; '
Kill every blossom, overrun each ﬂow’r

And wrest from beauty all its charming power;
The dying bud may burst to life again,

i And herbs o’erspread the snow-infested plain ; _
. , Green leaves may clothe the wint’ry widow’d trees,
‘ And where frost nipt, may fan the western breeze ;

“ But beauteous woman no redemption knows;

The wounds of honour, time can never close ,5?’

Her virtue sunk, to light can never rise,

Nor lustre beam from once guilt-clouded eyes.
Fix’d be thy mind, those pleasures to pursue,

That reason points as permanent and true;

Think not that bliss can mingle with a throng,

Whirl’d by a tide of idle forms along: “
Think not that Pleasure li-ves -with pomp and state,
Or soothes the bosom of the rich.an_d great ;

Think not to meet her at the ball or play,

Where ﬂirt the frolicksome, and haunt the gay ;‘
Think not she ﬂutters on the public walk, _
Or prompts the tongue that pours unmeaning talk ;
Or loves the breath of compliment to feel, —

Or stamps on crowns her estimable ‘seal.

A True Female Pleasure, of more modest -kind,
Springs from the heart, and lives within the mind ;
From noisy mirth, and grandeur’s' route she ﬂies,
And in domestic duties wholly lies.

 

* Ladies can never; too cautiously shun hypocrites in
love, as the bane of female innocence and virtue.

xxxvxn ‘ A mNxs'rER’s ADVICE.

As fades the ﬂower, that’s rear’d with tender care,
When left expos’d to storms and chilling air .5

So fades the fair, in reason’s sober eye, ’ [
That braves the crowd, nor heeds the danger nigh ;
Who giddy roves, with Folly’s motley queen,

Nor loves the transports of a life serene. '

Bethine the friendship of a chosen few,

Toievery virtue uniformly true; i r
Be thine the converse of some.kindred“mind,
Candid to all, but not to errors blind ;

Prudent to check or warn unguarded youth,

And guide thy steps in innocence and truth.
Those who regard, will fulsome language waive ;-
And, in the friend sincere, forget the" slave '; ‘a
Will make, like me, your happiness its care,

N or wink at specks, that render you less fair.

From books, too, dravv much proﬁt and delight,

Atearly morning, and at latest night;

But far, 0 far ! from thy chaste eyes remove .

The bloated page, that paints licentious love ;

That wakes‘ the passions, but not mend the heart,

And .only=leads to infamy and art ! ,

Let Addison’s and J ohnson’s moral page,

And Hawkesworth’s pleasing style, thy hours engage.

' From Milton feel the warm poetic ﬁre.
. Whomallthe nymphs of Helicon inspire,

With‘ Thomson, round the varied Seasons rove ;
His chaste ideasevery heart improve.
Lettuneful Pope instruct you how to‘sing,

To frame the lay, and raise the trembling wing.

Such be thy joys; and through this varied life,

Whether a maid, a mother, or a wife ;

May faircontent forever ﬁll thy breast,

And not an anxious care disturb thy rest ;,

May love, the purest passion of the skies,

Play ‘round thy heart, and sparkle in thine eyes ;

1 May all thy worth be virtue’ssweet regard,
‘ And goodness, only, claim thy just regard.

Some of the most ancient ,. compositions

  The Romans wereperfect masters of this
art; as CIoEno’s letters suﬂiciently evince;
nor are the moderns less sensible‘ of its ex-

Writers have built their fame upon epistolary

‘over almost every other species of composi- T

have the Greek and Roman histories, as Well
as those of other nations, admirably exe-
cuted inletters. Almost everything didac-
tic, andpreceptive, is delivered in this Way.
The novelist ﬁnds it better. adapted to his
purpose than any other mode of writing.
No great poet is without his familiar epistle

to his friend ; and the traveller» seemed lost, ,

how much an omission of payment may injure
them in the world; the credit on your bill al-

in trade to give, and what I give my customers
in general ; I hope, therefore, you will not take
it amiss, that I have drawn on you at six weeks

to permit a bill with your name on it to be dis-

Aniwgent demand of Payment.

MR. ToMPsoN,

The exigence of} my affairs compels me
thus importunely,n'ay, peremptorily to write to
you. Can you think it possible .to carry on busi-
ness in the manner you‘ act by» me’! You know
what promises you have made, and how from
time to time you have ‘broken them. ' Can I,
therefore, depend upon- any"new ones you make 2
If you use others as you" do me, how can you
think of carrying on business? If. you do not,
what must I think of the man,‘ who deals Worse
by me than he does by others ? If you think you
can trespass more upon me than you can on
others, that is a very bad compliment to my pru-
dence, or your own gratitude; for ‘surely good
usage should_be entitled to the same in return.
I know how to allow for disappointments as well
as ‘any man ; but can a, man be disappointed for-

. ever? Trade is so dependant‘ a thing, that it can-

not be carried on without mutual punctuality.
Does not the merchant expect it from me ‘for
those very goods I send you? And, can‘ I make
a return to him without receiving’ it from you ?

it becomes necessary for me to see a little to my

Solicz'tz'72g- the Loan of Money from a Friend._

DE‘A,*R SIR9, . _

I believe that ever since you ﬁrst knew me,
you will be readyto acknowledge that no person
was ever more difﬁdent in asking favours than
myself. Indeed I have always considered it as
most pleasing to an honest mind, to confer, than

receive a favour; but an unexpected affliction in

my family obliges me to solicit your assistance,
by the loan of about forty dollars for six months ;

but on this condition, that you can spare it with-

out hurting yourself; for I would by no means
choose that my friend should suffer in his present

circumstances in -order to obligeme. Indeed, ,

sir, I was some days engaged amongst my ac-

, quaintances to raise the money, before I could

prevail with myself to ask it from you; and that

lhave now done it, is from a principle far   more i

noble than any lucrative motive nor indeed
would I have asked it at all, were I not:morall'y
certain of paying it at the time proposed. I

am,‘ by mine’, six and forty; you are too young
to know the dutiesof a father. I have a son
whois seventeen,‘ and consequently too old to.

self A merely trustee for my children, and will not,

therefore, impose on you, by acceding to the com»-

have borne a 1ieutenant’s commission these three‘

years, as you tell me, you may, perhaps, have re...
served out of the proﬁts of that, a suﬂicient sum
to obviate every difficult on that head. /

IWill_ press these objects no ‘further; ‘when

business, and lives in credit and fashion. He is
about twenty-seven years old, and is; likely in his

ners, and iscome of a good family. ‘He has
broken his mind to me, and boasts how Well he
can maintain me; but I assure you, sir, I have

given him no encouragement, yet he resolves to

persevere, and pretends extraordinary affection
and esteem. I would not, sir, by any means,
omit to acquaint you with the beginning of an af-

your kind indulgence and affection. Pray give

DEAR PoLLr, ,
Your letter of the first instant came safe to

hand, wherein you acquaint me of the same pro-

posals made to you through your cousin’s recom-
mendation, by one Mr. Smith. I. hope, as you
assure me, that you have given no encourage-
ment to him ; for I by no means approve of him
for your husband. I have inquired of one of
histownsmen, whovknows him and his circum-
stances very Well, and 1 am neither pleased with
him or his character. ‘I wo-nder my cousinshould
so inconsiderately recommend him to you, though

courage his suit; for if on inquiry into his cha-
racter and circumstances, I shall ﬁnd that they
are answerable to your cousin’s good opinion of
them and his own assurances, I know not but
h1S suit maybe worthy of attention. However,
my dear girl,~consider that men are deceitful,

' and always put the best side outwards. It may

possibly, on the strict inquiry which the nature
and importance of the case demands, come out
far otherwise than ‘it at present appears. Let
me, therefore, advise you to act in this matter
with great prudence, and thatyoumake notyour-
self too_ cheap, for men are apt to slight what is
too easily obtained. In the mean time he may
be told, that you are entirely resolved to abide
by my determination in an affair of this great im-
portance. This will put him on applying to me,

I have for your amiable daughter, Whom I have I

least of her amiable perfections. If I might have .

theihonour of yourcountenance, sir, on this occa-

in that frank and honest‘ manner, which should
convince you of the sincerity of my affection for
your daughter, and at the same time of the hon-
ourableness of my intentions. In the mean time

I will in general, say, that I have been set-up in ,

my business, in the linen-drapery Way, ‘upwards
of three years ; that_I have a very good trade for
the time ;, and that I had a thousand pounds to

begin With, which I have improved to ﬁfteen hun- '

that you might know something of a person who
sues you for your countenance, and that of ‘your

prove the greatest happiness of my life, as it must
be, if I can be blessed With that and your daugh-

ther properly; forI am afraid We are deceiving
ourselves all this while. Am I a person whom
you esteem, Whose fortune you do not despise,

SIR,

Did I not make all the allowance. you de-’

sire in the end of your letter, I should not an-
swer you.at all. But although Iain really un-
happy to ﬁnd you are so, and the more to ﬁnd
myself to be the occasion, I can hardly impute
the unkindness and incivility of your letter to
the single cause you Would have me. Howev-
er, as I would not be suspected of any thing that

. should justify such treatment from you ; I ‘think

it necessary tog inform you, that What you have

heard has no more foundation than What you

have seen :y however, I wonder that others’ eyes
should not be as easily alarmed as yours; for

instead of being blind, believe me, sir, you see _
‘more than there is. Perhaps, however, their

sight may be has m_uch sharpened by unprovoked
malice, as yours by undeserved suspicion.
Wliatever may be the end of this dispute, for

I do not thinktso lightly. of lovers’ quarrels as ‘
.many do, I think it proper to inform you, that I
never. have thought favourably of any one ‘but ,

yourself; and I shall‘ add, that if the faults of

told me of it with less severity. If I am partic-

to get the better of that, if I had knownit was

treatment more than I do, but do not insult my

would want the excuse this has for my pardon;

ply with terms to which they had the utmost

aversion ; as if they had been allowed to consult
their own inclinations, and gave their hands
where they had engaged’ their hearts: for my

' own part, I have been always determined to con-

sult my own inclinations, Where there is the
least appearance of happiness; and having an
easy independency, am not anxious about in-

creasing it; being well convinced, that in all-
states the 1_ni‘ddl_e one isthe best. I mean neither’

poverty nor riches ; which leads it me to the
discovery of a passion which I have long endea-

cept of your offer, it wouldlay me under’ :-such

obligations as must destroy my liberty. Grati-

tude and love are two very different things.
The one supposes a beneﬁt received, Whereas
the other is a free act of the will. Suppose me
raised to the joint possession of your fortune,
could I call it mine unless I had brought you
something as an equiva-len_t?_ or, have I not
great reason to fear that you yourself may cons
sider me as under obligations inconsistent with
the character of a wife‘? I acknowledge the
great generosity of your offer, and would considv
er myself highly honoured, could I prevail with
myself to prefer topeace of mind the enjoyment

I could not, my dear child, give a more con-
vincing proof of my affeetioni for you, than in
submitting to send you toso great a distance
from me. I preferred your advantage to my own
pleasure, and sacriﬁced fondness ‘to duty. I
should have done this sooner, but I waited ‘till

my inquiries had found out a person whose cha-‘
_ racter might be responsible for your education;

and Mr. Browne was at length my_ choice for
that important trust. Your obedience, therefore,

must be vvithout_murmuring or reluctance ; es-‘

pecially when youreﬂect that a strict attention
to his appointments, and an implicit compliance
with his commands, arenot only to form ’ .the
rule of your ‘safe conduct in (this life, but to be
preparatory to your happiness in the next. With
regard to your school connexions, it is impossi-
ble for me to" give you any instructions at present.
All that I “shall now say to yougonﬁthis subject is,

quarrel with no one, avoid meddling with ‘the"dis-_

putes of others, unless With a View to promote
an accommodation; and though Ivvould wish

you to support the dignity of a youth, be neither

i LETTER LIX. .
From an eZde7f‘B'ro't/zer to a ymmger one at school.

As -you are now, my dear» brother, gone
from home, and placed in a very capital seminary
of learning, Ithought it not amiss to put you in
mind, that childish amusements should be laid a-
side, and, instead of them, more serious thoughts
imbibed, and things of more consequence made

the objects of your attention; whereby we may "

add to the reputation of our family, and gain to
ourselves the good esteem of being virtuous and
diligent. You may a judge, in some measure, of
the value of a good‘ education, from theunavail-
ing lamentations you daily hear those make,
who have .foolishly— shrunk from the diﬁiculties
attending the various branches of scholastic edu-
cation. What a difference there is between an
aged man. of ' learning, and one who 'totally._neg-
lectedhis education in his youth! The former,
in the evening of his life, ﬁnds a perpetual
source of amusement in the knowledge he’ ac-

quired in his early days, and his company is ad- '

mired and; sought by all those who wish to de-
rive understanding from the knowledge of oth-
ers, improved by a long life a11d‘phil0s0ph_ic_al_
experience ; but the ignorant old , man is no
company for himself, nor any one else, unless
over a pitcherbr a bottle, when the assistance of
a pipe will be necessary to excuse his silence. I
know you have too much good nature‘ to be of-'
fended at my advice, especially when I assure you,
that I as sincerely wish your happiness and ad-

LETTER Lx.

I -From a Father to his Son, ~com§az'm'7zg general

rules for agreeable conversation.

I have taken this opportunity, my dear Har-
ry, to inform you of some things in your general
conversation, which I think would be proper for
you to observe and amend, particularly, yourex-
cessive fondness fortalking, which equally discov-
ers itself on all occasions; I have always consid-
ered you as a youth who does not want sense, and
I am willing to hope that I am not therein deceiv-
ed:’but the dangerous self suﬂiciency of most
‘young men,. seems to have seized you in a violent
degree, which I hope a little: reﬂection. will‘ re-
move. The art of rendering yourself agreeable

in. conversation, is a matter.worthy of your most-

serious study. It is an advantage which few
can boast of, though all, put in their claim for it ;
and nothing is so constant an enemy to success,
in those who would excel in this art, as their
harbouring an opinion of their own Iproﬁeiency,

before they have attained to any tolerable degree ’
of knowledge in what they imagine themselves“

ON RELATIONSHIP. o 95

possessed of." Conversation, Whenrightly man-«

aged, will admit every member of theicompany

to have a share in the pleasure and applause it '
affords. If a man speaks little, you must not’
from thence conclude that he is willing to give

up every claim to conversable "merit. Perhaps
he cannot sing; but he certainly is as desirous of
having his peculiar humour, or his dry jokeapp
plauded, as you may be for being called on for
another song. Though he may be no mathema-
tician, perhaps he is versed in religious disputa-
tion; if he despiseplays, he may admire history‘;

though he understand not geography, he may
_ know how to describe the humours of mankind;

and though he pretends not to politics, he may
have a turn for some more useful science. Wheri
these things are considered,‘ if his modesty be

' great, you cannot oblige him more than by giving
him an opportunity to display his capacity on the ‘
subject, he believes himself mostiable to handle

iwith advar_1tage:, for in order to support a tho-.

rough good humour, a man must be pleased with
himself as wellas with others. When this’ is pro-
perly managed, conversation seldom fails to
prove entertaining; and. to the neglect of this
is owing many of ‘the yawning hours, spent in
companies composed of men not capable of be-
having agreeably. The manner of telling astory
is also worth your notice, and you have known

the pleasure of hearing a long» one well told.

Mr. Jackson has an admirable talent in that way;
but then you must observe, that half the plea-
sure he gives arises from his happily avoiding any
of the silly digressions which a_re thegreat cause
of a story seeming tedious. You never hear him

bour has produced only a mouse?’ ' These. are

loose and general hints ; but by a due improve-

ment of them, you will ﬁnd yourself very sensibly
grow more and more agreeable, wherever you
converse. Aneasyand becoming ‘freedom you
have already, and by the addition of discretion in
the use of it, and complaisance to others, you will

ablein the opinion of men of sense and judgment, .

which, should you accomplish it, will add much

LETTER LXI,

From an Uncle to at Nephew, on his /seeping, bad

company, bad ﬂours, (90. in his apprenticeship.

DEAR NEPHEW,   T t , i
I am very much concerned to hear.-, that you

are of late falleninto bad company; that you

ON RELATIONSHIP. I \ 97

keep bad hours, and give great uneasiness to
your. master, and breaks the rules of his family.
That when he expostulates with you on this ac-
count, you return pert _and bold answers; and in-
stead of promising or endeavouring to amend, re-
peat the offence ; and have entered into clubs
and societies of young fellows, who set at nought

~ all good example, and. make such persons as
« would do their duty, the subject of their ridicule,

as persons of narrow minds, and who want the
courage to do as they do. ' ,

Let me on this occasion ejrpostulate with you,
and set before you the evil of the way you are in.

In -the first place: What can you mean by
breaking the rules of a family you had bound‘
yourself by contract to observe ? Do you think it
honest, to break through engagements into which

you have solemnly entered‘; and which, are no i

less the rules of the corporation you are to be one
day free of, than those of a private family? Sev-
en years, several of which are elapsed, not so

long a term but that you may see it terminate be-~

fore you are over ﬁt to be, trusted with’ your own
conduct : Twenty-one or twenty-two years of
age is full early for a young man to be his own
master, whatever you may think ; and you may
-surely stay till then atleast, to choose your own
hours, and yourcompany: and I fear as you go
on, if you do not mend your ways, your discretion
will not then do credit to your choice. Remember
you have no time you can call your own, during
the continuance of your contract ; and must you

abuse your master in a double sense? rob him of a

his time, especially if any of it be hours of bus-
  p   9 A r r r

98 I LETTER "WRITER.

ness ?.rob him of his rest ; break the peace of his
family, ‘and give a bad example to others ".9 And all
for what’! Why to riot in the company of aset of
persons,,who contemn, as they teach you to do
all order and discipline; who, in all likelihood,
will lead you into gaming, drinking, swearing,
and even more dangerous vices, to the unhin-ging
of your mind from your business, which must
be ‘your future support. , ' ~
Consider, I exhort you, in time, towhat these

courses may lead you.‘ Consider the afﬁiction__ '

you Willgive to all your friends, by your continu-
ancein them.’ Lay together the substance of the
conversation that passes in a whole evening, with
your frothy companions, after you have come

a from them, and reﬂect what solid truth, what use«

ful lessons, worthy of ' being inculcated in your

future life, thatiwhole evening has afforded you ;~ I

and consider whether it is worth breaking through
all rule and order for.P——Whether your present
conduct is’, such as you‘ would allow in a ser—

vant of your own C? T Whether you are so capable’

to pursue your business with that ardour and de-
light next morning, as if you had not drank or
kept bad hours over night? \ If not, whether
your master has not a double loss and damage
from your misspent evenings? Whether’ the
taking of small liberties, as you may think them,

‘leads you not onto greater’! Forlet me tell y_ou,

you will notﬁnd it in your power to stop when
you will  And then, whether any restraint’ at all
will not in time be irksome to you?

, I have gone through the" like ‘servitude with
pleasure and credit. I found myself my own
master full soon for my discretion. What you

ON RELATIONSHIP. 99

think of yourself I know not; but I wish your
' may do as well for your own interest and reputa-

tion-too, as 1 have done for mine: and I’ll assure
you I should not have thought it eithericreditable
or honest to do as you do. I could have stood
the laugh of an hundred such vain’ ‘companions
as you choose, for being too narrow minded to
break through all moral obligations to my mas-

ter, in order to show the bravery of a bad heart, .
and what an abandonedcmind dared to perpetrate. ,

A badbeginning seldom makes a good ending;
and if you were assuredthat you could stop
when you come for yourself, which is very improb-4

able, how will you answer it to equity and a good

conscience, that you will not do so for your mas»

ter/; There ‘is, let "me tellyou, more true bravery

of mind in forbearing to do an injury, than in 1'

giving offence. ,

You are now at an age, when you should
study to improve, not divert your faculties. You
should now lay in a fund of knowledge, that in
time, when‘ ripened‘ by lexperience, may make
you’ a worthy member of the commonwealth.
Do you think you have nothing to learn, either

_as to your business, or as to the forming of L your

mind? Would it -not be much better to choose
the silent, the sober conversation of books, than
of such-‘companions as never read or think’! An
author never commits any but his best thoughts

. to paper; - but what can you expect from the

laughing, noisy company you keep, but frothy
prate, indigested notions, and thoughts .so un-
worthy. of being remembered, that it isthe great-=
estwisdom to forget them ?'
