96 SPARTA.

miles in circumference. The ruins still remain, at
a little distance from the modern town of Misitra.
Sparta anciently had no Walls, as it depended for

[its defence on the characteristic energy of its in-

habitants. The houses Were little graced with
architectural ornaments, but were lofty, and built

_with great soli.dity.

The citizens of Sparta consisted of two classes,
——p—-such as were born citizens, and such as had
been presented with the freedom. On the birth

_ of a child, he was carried to a public place, where

the aged persons of his tribe were to judge wheth-

er he appeared healthy and Well—forrned, so as to
be likely to prove one of thefuture defenders of ..

his country. if of a ‘weaklyconstitution, he was
cast into a gulf, for it was not deemed expedient
that a deformed or sickly child should live.
When the parents were both Spartans, and the
children brought up according to the prescribed
institutions-, in their thirtieth year they became
legitimate citizens,'and» eligible to bear office in
the magistracy, or in the army. Unless the pa-
rents were both Spartans the children were not
legitimate. Freedom was sometimes bestowed in

reward of extraordinary services, but that was of
rare occurrence.

In addition to those enjoying the full privileges
of citizens, there was a class of freedmen who had
not complied with all the regulations required in
their education; these were disqualiﬁed for hold-
ing oﬂices in the state, but were competent to

' give their votes.

In Sparta there were more slaves than in any

other city of Greece. They were employed in

domestic drudgery and laborious occupations.

SPARTA. 9‘?

In a medium condition, between the slaves and
the freedmen, were the Helots. The city of Helos
had been taken by the Spartans, and all the in-
habitantswere reduced to subjection, and others
afterwards were associated with them.

These acted as farmers on the lands, for which
they paid a ﬁxed rent, which it would have been
disgraceful in any proprietor to increase. They
were also employed in various mechanical arts.
In time of. war they assisted on board the ﬂeets,
and in the land armies; every heavy armed sol-
dierwas accompanied. by one or more of them.

As the Helots exceeded the freedmen in num-
ber, they became a source of terror, and various
means were resorted to, to keep them in subjection.

As, a trait of the Spartan character, history has ‘

noticed the Helots, as being compelled at times to

drink to excess, and in that condition led into the

public halls, that the youth might be impressed
with a sense of the disgrace of drunkenness. In
any other city, it would have been easy, without

compulsion, to ﬁnd persons who would indulge in-»

drinking to intoxication. s

It is certain that the Helots were thought dif-
ficult to govern, from their numbers, courage and
wealth, In times of imminent danger, they were

encouraged to exert themselves by the hopes of

being admitted to the rights of citizens, pwhiéh

they sometimes obtained. This liberality was not

always shown, and they were, in consequence,

often induced to join with an invading enemy. T p

CHAPTER 

Sparta-9--Continited. T

IN the political constitution of Sparta, there
were two kings; a senate of twenty—eight old
men, ﬁve magistrates ” called ephori, ‘resembling

the tribunes of the people at Rome, but with more .

extensive powers; assembliesof the free citizens

_for discussing their own.pe_culi‘ar interests; and

assemblies of all the citizens of the other free
towns in Laconia. '

There were two kings at Sparta, of two different
families, in each of which the crown descended to
the eldest son, or to the nearest male heir. The
heir to the crown was not brought up with the
other children of the state,’ that he might not be

in danger of losing the respect necessary for his

station. I  
The power of the kings was very limited.
Their chief power in peace was to regulate mat-.

’ters "connected with religion, and to appoint va-

rious inferior oﬂicers of the magistracy and priest-
hood. They presided in the senate, and proposed
matters for deliberation; and each had two suf-

frages. They were considered as merely the first a

citizens of a free state, and went about without a
retinue and without ostentation. In time of war,
the kings commanded the armies, with full pow-
ers of a general, and had liberty to conclude a
truce with the enemy. -

The senate consisted of twenty-eight members,
above sixty years of age, elected to the ofﬁce for
life by thevoice of the citizens. Their office was

SPARTA. 99

to deliberate on all questions respecting peace and
war, foreign alliances, &c. They were judges in
matters of importance, and both the lives and for-
tunes of the people depended on their decisions.
' The ephori were ﬁve in number, elected annu-
ally by the citizens. r They held courts in the fo-
rum, where they decided in matters of dispute
between individuals, and also, along with the sen-
ate, they had the power of life and death. They
had, likewise, authority over other magistrates,
so as to depose or imprison, and bring_ them to
trial for their lives. They could assume this right
over the kings, but they were very delicate in ex;
ercising it. Two of them generally accompanied
the king in his military expeditions, as a watch
over his conduct.    

To these magistrates was entrusted the care of
education,———to see that the children were brought
up according to the institutions of Lycurgus.
They had the executive power, received foreign
ambassadors, convened general assemblies, and
presided in them; they levied troops, and sent
them to their destination; and sent to the general
of the army, orders which he was bound to obey.

,The assemblies of the people were to decide on
matters laid before them by the senate. They
were composed of all the citizens of thirty years
of age. The citizens of Laconia were 30,000 in
number. Lycurgus caused the whole country to
be divided into that number of equal shares, of
which the district of Sparta contained, according
to some accounts, 9,000; but according to others
only 6,000 or 4,500-. .

Celibacy was considered disgraceful, and‘bach-
elors ‘were subjected to various penalties. The

100 , smnra.

citizens were required to marry Women of their

own rank and without portions, that they might
form a union from motives of pure affection.
Lycurgus ordained that children of all ranks
should be brought up in the same manner; that
they should be inured to bridle their appetites,
and, be accustomed to spare meals and fasting.

. At twelve years of age, they were examined to

see how far they were competent to endure dark»
ness and solitude, and also as to their temperance
in the choice of arlzicles of food.  
e The Spartans were ordered to eat together in
public, and non-attendance at these meals was
subject to a ﬁne. The intention of the law_ was
to repress luxury; and that the young might de-
rive instruction from the aged, who were Wont to
relate, during the repast, all such achievements as
had been marked with celebrity during their
lives. It was forbidden to eat at home, previous
to going to these meals. The kings, magistrates,
and citizens, seated themselves at tables contain‘—
ing ﬁfteen covers, each. The guests at one table
did not interfere with those of another, but- formed
a fraternity into which no person could be received
but by the consent of all who composed it.
Their food and drink were of the plainest sort,

and one dish in particular, the black brat/z, has '
. been spoken of in allﬁages. The expense of these

public meals was defrayed by individuals who
were obliged to furnish every month a certain
quantity of barley—meal, wine, cheese, ﬁgs and
money.

The rich and poor were clothed alike. They
w,ere.not to change either the fashion or the ma»-
terials of l their garments, which were calculated

srxivrx. 101'

to produce warmth, and but little adapted for or-
nament; Even the kings conformed to this cus-
tom. Boys were not permitted to wear shoes,
that their feet might become indurated, and that
they might early climb steep and rough declivities.
The Spartans were not to use baths or ointments,
except at stated times, but were expected to bathe
in the river. , p , -

So long as the Spartans remained independent
of other states, they were, at home, bound as

strictly by the laws and customs, as soldiers are '

by the rules of war in a camp. , t

Obedience to superiors was strictly required, as
a matter which constituted the essence of all gov-
ernment. To honor the aged was also -especially

enjoined. The youths rose up Whenever the old

men entered; they gave way to them in the

streets, and were silent. when they spoke. As all
children were deemed the property of the state,
the old assumed the authority of parents, and
might reprove not only their own sons, but those
of others, if concernediin any impropriety.

  The Spartans made no ‘great proﬁciency in
science, literature, or the arts. Even their laws,
for a long period, were not committed to Writing.
They were forbidden to exercise any mean or me-
chanical occupation. V

Theprofession of a soldier was the most honor-
able. Curious and reﬁned arts, or such as tended

to luxury, were forbidden. ’ Theatrical entertain-
ments were not allowed.

It is stated by credible authors, that the Spartan

youth were allowed to steal, but if detected they

were liable to be punished for their Want of dex--i

terity. To be distinguished by such regulations
as these, seems a matter of unslrilful policy. a
Boys were daily exercised in hunting, to-render

them robust and active. Young men and women '

were to practise dancing. They were also to be
exercised in running, wrestling and throwing the
quoit or javelin. It was the intention of the legis—
later that the Women, as Well as men, should be
strong and alert. The youths were to be con-
stantly employed. At a certain time, boys were
to be Whipped in the temple, and around the altar

  of Diana. This took place once every year; and

such as endured this ﬂagellation without groaning
or shedding a tear, were held in high‘ esteem.

Gold and silver were prohibited under severe
penalties, and‘ no money except that made of iron
Was allowed. Contracts were made by barter.
The laws respecting money were ill observed, and,
after the conquest of Athens, were abrogated
entirely. ‘ ,  

Till a man arrived at the age of thirty, he was
not to be sent abroad to serve in the army, but

‘was to remain at home to defend the country. I

They were not to undertake sieges of towns, or
engage at sea’; but this law grew in time to be
disregarded. A soldier who lost his shield in
battle, was deemed infarnous._ T   ’
In time of War, the severity of their regulations
was relaxed, and the soldiers were permitted to:
indulge in such enjoyrnrents as they could procure.
They were not to commence a military expedi-3
tion before the full moon. Bravery in War was
one great object Which their education was calcu-
lated to promote. Whoever left the ranks and:

ﬂed was inevitably disgraced.

STATES or GREECE. 103

If the Spartans fell in battle on the frontiers, it
was the law and custom that their bodies should
be carried back and interred in their family sepul-
chres,‘ unless it should appear that they had re-
ceived their death in ﬂight; in that case they
were left unburied.

EGHAPTER XXXII.

Other States at Greece.

THE other states of Greece, like Athens and
Sparta,,had'a republican form of government. In

some of them the chief ‘power was in the rich,

and thepconstitution was oligarchical for aristo-
cratical. In others, the people had the supreme
power, and the constitution was democratical.
In almost {all the states, the two parties were
ever. struggling for the ascendency. A similar
jealousy was entertained in Sparta and Athens;
the former favoring the aristocracy, and the latter
‘supporting the cause of the people.

In none of them were the same rigorous institu-
tions as at Sparta, and nowhere were the arts
and sciences,‘ learning and philosophy, so much
cultivated as at Athens.

The council of the Amphictyons resembled the
diet of the Germanic empire in modern times, or
the general diet of the deputies of the cantons of
Switzerland. In this confederation, twelve na-.

tions of the Greeks associated together, each of ‘

which might give two votes or suffrages, and send
what number of deputies they thought ﬁt.

.104 STATES or GREECE.

The obgect was to settle matters connected with
the general interest; but chieﬂy to decide questions
between any two states, so as to obviate the nee
cessity of an appeal to arms.

This council was held in the spring at the city
of 4 Delphi, and in winter at Anthela, near the
Straits of Thermopylee. At their meetings, a nu-
merous concourse of spectators attended,'and they
opened their proceedings by sacriﬁces and reli-
gious observances.

, This league was ratiﬁed by the following oath;
“We swear never to destroy any Amphictyonic
town, nor divert, either in peace or war, the springs
or streams necessary to supply its wants. »   If any
power shall attempt it, we will march against that
power, and destroy its cities. Should impious
men seize upon the ofl"erings in the temple of A,pol«
lo, at Delphi, we swear to employ our feet, _*O11l°
voices, our arms, and all our powers, against
them and their accomplices.” ° ‘ '

The Amphictyonic council could levy ﬁnes on

offending cities; and, if not promptly paid, the.
ﬁnes were doubled. If the party against which

the ﬁne was awarded, still continued refractory,
the league called upon all the confederate states
to arm and support its decrees. They also ex»
pelled from, their council the deputies of the of»

‘fending state.

The feebler states were obliged to submit, but
the more ltrowerful, when they had a considerable
interest at stake, were not so complying. Thus,
the Lacedsemonians, after they had been ﬁned

500 talents for seizing on the citadel of Thebes in
, time of peace, refused to pay; and when the ﬁne
was doubled, they still held out, alleging that the

ROME; T 105

decree was unjust ;l and by force of arms persisted

in disobedience.

‘For robbing the temple of Delphi, the most se-
vere vengeance was denounced; and in case, of
resistance, death and deprivation of sepulture was

, inflicted.

The vast treasures accumulated in this temple,
tempted the Phoceans to violate the precincts, and
they took from it immense sums. They success-
fully resisted for some time the Baaotians and
othefstates; but at last they" were miserably de-
stroyed by Philip, king of Macedon. That subtle
politician availed himself of the popularity of the
act to appear as an avenger of the gods. Philip

-was, after this, admitted into the council, which

extended his inﬂuence over Greece till he had
reduced it to a state bordering on subjection.

CHAPTER XXXIII.
The City of Home.

THE city of Rome derived its name from Rom-
ulus, Who, with acolony from Alba Longa, founde
ed it 753 years before Christ. It was built on the
banks of the river Tiber, and stood on the seven
hills, Palatinus, Capitolinus, Aventinus, Quirina-

lis, Coelius, Viminalis, and Esquilinus, and in its _
most ﬂourishing state, its walls surrounded a

space of ﬁfty miles. This territory was divided
into ‘three unequal parts, one of which was allot-
ted for the service of religion, and for building

temples; another for the king’s revenue and the

uses of the state; and the third and most consid-

erablepart was divided into thirty portions, to an»

swer to the thirty curiae, or divisions of the people.

Rome, in its day of glory, abounded in magniﬁ-
cent temples, amphitheatres, and places for eX-
ercise and amusement; buildings for the assem~
blies of the people, public places, piazzas or porti-
coes, columns, triumphal arches, and trophies,
aqueducts, public sewers, and highroads.

The forum was the most ancient public build»
ing in Rome; it was composed of _a vast assem-
blage of sumptuous but irregular ediﬁces, forming
a spacious oblong square, entirely surrounded by
a piazza terminated at each end by a triumphal

arch, It was here that the assemblies of the pe0-_

pile were held, and harangues delivered to the ple-
beians, or common people.

Here also justice was administered in Vast halls
appropriated to the different tribunals; it was,
moreover, the residence of the chief bankers, and
contained a variety of shops stored‘ with a profu-
sion of the most costly merchandise, and, conse-
quently, was the mart for all irnportant and com-
mercial transactions. lThis being the emporium
of law, politics, and trade, it became equally the
resort of the man of business and the lawyer, and
was the scene of the chief bustle of the city.

Of its present state we have the following aue

, thentic description: “Its temples are fallen; its

sanctuaries have crumbled into dust; its colon-
nades encumber the pavements, now buried under

' their remains. ,The walls of the rostra, stripped

of their ornaments and doomed to eternal silence;
a few shattered porticoes, and here and there an

~ insulated column standing in the midst of broken

shafts, vast fragments of marble capitals, and

traveller that the ﬁelds which he now traverses
were once the Roman forum. ,So far have the
modern» Romans 4 forgotten the theatre’ of their

glory, and the imperial power of their ancestors,

as to degrade it into a common market for cattle.’’

The adueducts were by far the noblest proof’ of V‘

~ thegrandeur of Rome. ‘ Some of these wonderful

channels, brought water from upwards of sixty
miles, through rocks and mountains and over val-
leys, supported on arches in some places more
than one hundred feet high, one row being placed

above another.
The city was cleansed by means of sewers of

stupendous magnitude, and of such solid, work—
manship that, after a lapse of more than two thou-
sand years, though earthquakes have‘ shaken the’
very foundations of the city, ‘the principal drain,

is still entire.

108» ROME.

The Romans paid extraordinary attention to the
‘construction of roads. They were carried in va-
rious directions throughout the whole extent of the
vast empire, and were formed with such solidity as
still to remain in many places in perfectrepair.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
R0n1e—-Divisioiis of the People.

IN the early ages of its history, when Rome

was but thinly inhabited,‘ whoever ﬁxed their

abode within its limits, obtained the right of citi-,

zens ; but as the power and extent of the empire
increased, and the dignity of a ,Roma.n citizen
began to be more regarded, this privilege was more

-sparingly conferred.

The citizens were divided into three tribes, and
each tribe into ten curiae; but the number of

tribes was afterwards augmented to thirty-ﬁve,

and they were separately classed, in ,.order to dis-
tinguish between the actual residents of the city
and those subjects of the commonwealth who
lived wholly without its limits.

The people were, at first, only separated into
two. ranks, the patrician and plebeian; but the
order of equites, or knights, was afterwards. ad-
ded, and at a still later period, slaves were intro-
duced. The population was, therefore, composed
of four classes,—patricians, knights, plebeians,
and slaves. T

The patrician order consisted of those families
whose ancestorshad been members of the senate

gr: OME. 109‘

in the earliest periods of the regal or consular

government. .

The equestrian order arose out of an institution
ascribed to Romulus, who is said to have selected
one hundred young men from each of the tribes,
to serve on horseback as his personal guard.  

The plebeian order was composed of the lowest
class of freernen. . They were divided into country
plebeians and city plebeians. The latter consist»-
ed not only of the poorer mechanics and laborers,
but of a multitude of idlers, Whose turbulence was
a constant source of disquietude to the govern-
merit. a ,

Among this degradedclass arose seditious and
conspiracies; and the ﬁnal overthrow of the re-
public and the extinction of liberty, may be, to a
considerable extent, attributed to the increasing
strength, and number, and turpitude, of this de-
scription of the plebeians. This, however, can
be applied only to the lowest class of them. Many
of the most estimable citizens were to be found in
that order, and not a few rose from it to high offi-
ces, and some to the first dignities of the state.

Men became slaves by being taken in war, by a
being born in a state of servitude, or by being re— ‘

duced to that condition as a punishment; and they

were not entitled to any privileges of freernen, not

considered as citizens.

They really possessed no political rights, and
were by law rendered incapable of acquiring prop-
erty, or of giving evidence in a court of justice;
and were viewed in no other light than the chattels
orproperty of their masters.

There was a constant market for slaves at
Rome, and regular dealers in. the trade of selling

10   ‘ T =

r them. They were, usually, exposed in a state of

nudity, and wore a label on the neck descriptive
of their qualities, and seem to have been transfer-

  red in much the same manner as cattle.

Masters possessed absolute power over them,
and; were authorized to put them to death af
pleasure,——a right often most inhumanly exeri
cised. The laws in regard to them were extreme-
ly harsh and rigorous, and one of them provided,
that, if a master of a family were slain in his own
house, and the murderers were not discovered, all
his domestic slaves were liable to be putto death.
Tacitus records an instance of T four hundred hav-
ing thus suffered in. one family.

Slaves were frequently liberated by their mas‘-
ters, T and at that time their heads wereshaved and
they received a cap as a badge of their liberty, of
which it has become the emblem. ’ They then as«
sumed the name of their master, which they pre—
ferred to their own, and were ever after called his
ifreedmen. A i .

CHAPTER XXXV.

R0me—-Form of Government.

TRADITION describes the original constitution of
Rome, as having been purely monarchical ; but it
was essentially a military democracy, founded or
the rude basis of a barbarous horde, submitting‘
for their common interest, to‘ the dominion of one
chieftain; and, byencroaching on the neighboring
states, enlarging their territory and their power;

ROME---FORM or GOVERNMENT. 111

until they acquired the consistence of a nation,
and assumed a regular form of government.
Romulus was ﬁrst elected king and supreme
magistrate by the inhabitants. The regal power
subsisted for two hundred and forty—three years,
under seven kings. The last of these was TﬂT~
quin, who, with his family, was expelled on ac-
count of his tyranny and cruelty. ,
  The kings were elective, and limited in their
power; they could neither enact laws, nor make
war orpeace, without the concurrence of the sen-

. ate and people. Their badges were a white robe

with stripes of purple, and fringed with the same

— color, a golden cross, an ivory sceptre, and a eu-

rule, or state chair. .

The power of the people in Romewas elicited
in their public assemblies. It was theirs to enact
laws, elect magistrates, to decide concerning war
and peace, and to. try persons guilty of certain
heinous offences. An assembly of the whole Ro-
man people was called Comitia.

The senate was the grand council of the empire;
they were also a body of magistrates entrusted
with the power of putting the laws into execution.
. The senators were originally chosen from the
most distinguished citizens, and their number was
then conﬁned to one hundred; but it afterwards
gradually extended to a thousand,.and the knights
and plebeians were indiscriminately admitted.

The senate was consulted on everything per-
taining to the administration of the state, except
the creation of the magistrates, the passing of
laws, and the determination of war and peace.
In .many respects the mode of debating, voting,
and passing decrees in the senate, appears to have

112 ,ROME—-FORM or GOVERNMENT.

borne a strong similitude to the proceedings in the
British House,‘ of Commons. Each individual
gave his opinion in a speech of any length which
he chose, and the indulgence in this privilege fre-
quently caused a decision to be deferred from day

to day. Sometimes long speeches -were,interrupt- 
ed, as in modern times, by the bustle and clamor ‘

—-—by the “coughing down ”——of other senators.

When all had oifered their opinions, either by
tacit assent or by speech, the presiding officer re?»
ported the arguments, and divided the house to
tell the number on each side of the question, and
ascertain the majority. A decree was then made
out, called “se7zaz‘2z.s consuZz‘u.m,” and referred to
the tribunes of the people for their concurrence or
rejection. g - § i

A magistrate in the Roman republic, was one
possessed of public authority, either civil, reli-
gious, or military; so that the same person might
act as a priest and a judge, regulate the police of
the city, direct in the affairs of the empire, and
command an army.

Previous to the election they were called cam,di~
dazfgi, (clothed in white,) from the White robe which

.they'Wo_re while soliciting the votes of the peo«

ple. Hence the origin of the Word “ cctncZidate.’?

,The magistrates called ordinary, were the con—
suls, praetors, censors, tribunes, eediles, and quaes-
tors, who were created at stated times, and were
constantly in the republic.

The extraordinary magistrates were the dictator
and master of \ horse, the decemviri, military trib—
unes, and interrex, who were not constantly and
Statedly elected, but arose out of public disorder
or emergency. ~

All magistrates were obliged, within ﬁve days

ROME--~FORM or GOVERNMENT. T 113

after entering on their office, to swear that they
would observe the laws of the empire; and after

Review.

WE have now noticed the great, states and
empires of antiquity, and given some idea of their
political institutions. t Wehave seen that the first
great empire of the world was that of Assyria,
Which, began with Nimrod, about 2200 years be-
fore Christ, and which continued till about the
year 538, when it was ,swallo'vved up by Persia.
 Persia greatlylextended its dominion, and under
Cyrus and Cﬁambyses, about 530 years B. 0., it
embraced Mesopotamia,‘ ,,Palestine,, Syria, and
_E’giy,pt.' In the year 33*0,wPersia, was invaded
by._,AleXander of Macedon; its capital was taken
and its king put to ﬂight. The Greek dominion
was of short duration, for the Parthians soon con-
quered Persia, since which period it has ever
continuedto be an inferior power. , t . ,
Throughout the Whole history of the great an-
cient empires, the government was despotic, the
kings claiming absolute authority, even to - the
taking of life and property, and the people blindly
and slavishly submitting. P A _
  The political institutions of other countries in
Asia havealso been similar to" those of Persia
and Assyria, excepting among the wandering
tribes, who have ever ,maintained a patriarchal
form of ‘government. China and Japan, two pop,-
u-lous empires, have despotic governments, and
both exclude foreigners from their dojminions, al-
lowing them to trade only at a single port in each
country. These two last, though of great an-

tiquity, still continue to maintain their ancient

systems with little change.

The institutions of the Hebrews, though in
some respects similar to those of most eastern na-»
tions, were in others altogether peculiar, and have
never been adopted by any other nation of an~
cient or modern times. ,

With the exception of the last, we see little in the

E ‘governments of these countries that is worthy of

our inritation. We learn from them, indeed, only
lessons o_f warning. They all show us that coun-
tries submitting to despoticinstitutions, continue
in a state of ignorance, weakness and degradation.

About 1500 years before Christ, the seeds of
learning and arts are wafted from Egypt to Greece,
and here, after five hundred years, they spring up
and ﬂourish. It is in Greece that the ﬁrst clear
ideas of human rights, and of human governinent
to secure them, are disclosed and attempted to be
realized. Here we see a people. rising to a high
degree of civilization and power through the in-
ﬂuence of freedom, yet, for the want of a solid
basis of religion and morality in society, ﬁnally
crumbling to "pieces; leaving, where a blaze of
light once sent forth its illumination far and wide,
but a ghastly heap of ruins.»

Rome, borrowing something from Egypt and

' Greece, becomes a mighty empire, swallowing up

all the great kingdoms around her, whether in
Europe, Asia, or Africa. She grows rich on the

spoils of other nations. For a time she feels the

ﬁre of liberty, but this vanishes amid the corrup-
tions and looseness that pervade society; and,
ﬁnally, gorged with conquest and bloated with
wealth, she becomes the prey of the Goths and

tain things, and that commands and requires
certain other things. «

, After a time, the child makes further observa-
tions; he perceives that certain rules of action are
laid down which he is required to follow, habit-
ually. He is required, for instance, to come to

his meal when the bell -is rung; he is required

every morning to go to school at a stated hour;
he is commanded always to speak the truth; he is
forbidden to take that which is not his own; he is
forbidden to speak falsehood, or to injure the body
or feelings of his companions.

Thus, the child acquires his first ideas of law,
which he perceives to be general and ﬁxed rules,
by which action is to be regulated. Accordingly,
the ﬁreside rules are the ﬁrst laws to which we
are subjected; theyproceed from the family gov-»
ernment, which is vested¥in.' etlie hands of the
parents. a ,,  

The ideas of government and law are there-
fore very early ones, and, for: obvious reasons, they
make a deep and abiding impression. In the first
place, these laws come from parents, whom chil-
dren usually regard with affection and veneration.
The parents are the protectors of children; the
source from which their comforts and pleasures
ﬂow, and from whom their first knowledge is
obtained.

’Obedience to law, therefore, coming from such
a source, would seem to be easy and natural ; and
it doubtless is so, provided the family govern-
ment be; well and wisely administered. it And

Rome were forgotten, and those of the northern

nations of Europe became partially established

over this entire quarter of the globe.

The Feudal System.

THE feudal system, so often noticed in history,
appearsto have existed in Europe at an early
date, among the tribes that inhabited Germany.
These,.like the Celts who first settled France,
Spain, Britain, and Ireland, doubtless came from
Asia, The period of their first emigration may
have been, and doubtless Was, 1500 or 2000 years
before Christ; but tribe after tribe continued to
ﬂow into Europe, down to theltime of Rome’s
ﬁnal overthrow by the Goths. , p  
t It is probable that the German tribes brought
their feudal system of government with them; but
it doubtless became much modiﬁedpafter its es-
tablishment in Europe. It existed among the

Franks, one of those tribes; andpthese, making

some conquests in Gaul, under their king, Phara»
mond, about A. D. 420, and ﬁnally settling in
that country, established it there.

From this period, the feudal system is seen ex» T

tending over all parts of Europe, until, in the
course of a few centuries, _all the great kingdoms
of Europe are founded upon it as the basis of their

. political institutions.

It must be remembered that these German
tribes, as well as the other inhabitants of Europe,

were, at the period of which we treat, chiefly ad- T

dicted to war. They had ﬂocks, and; sometimes
settled down, for half a century or more, in one

"spot, pursuing agriculture in intervals of peace.

But they Were, still, always looking out for some
rich tribe or country which they might plunder.

In this state of things the people required bold
and active leaders; those who were fond of strife,
and capable of ensuring victory in their bloody
enterprises. Accorclingly, we ﬁnd, them generally
under the sway of kings Whose character was
marked with strength and courage, mingled witlij
skill and sagacity. The sovereigns were always
assisted "by chiefs, who partook of the character-
istics of their leaders. V d

When one of these tribes conquered a country,
they divided the spoils among themselves. The
king took by far the largest portion; his chiefs
took less, and the common soldiers a still smaller
share. The lands Were Wholly taken by the king
and his chiefs, who were called barons.

There was one condition on which these lands
‘Wereheld, which constituted the chief feature of
the feudal system. A baron held his land upon
condition that, when required by his king, he

should bring all his men, capable of bearing arms,
into his service. The people were permitted to
cultivate the lands of the barons on the condition
that they, too, should do military as, Well as other
service in behalf of their liege lords, in case of
need. ' '

The common people were called serfs‘, and were '

little more than slaves, being completely subject
to the power of their masters.   They were, how-.
ever, permitted to live upon the lands of the chiefs,
and though often treated with cruelty, and some-
times sufl"ering the most degrading outrages,» they
were generally supplied liberally with the neces-

saries of life. .

It was about the year 480, that Clovis became
king of France, the government being based upon
the feudal system. This monarchy continued to
increase in power, until it became established, and
has ever since been one of the leadirl towers of

In Germany and the north of Europe, kingdoms
continued to be established) on a feudal basis, from
the ﬁfth to the twelfth century, until at last all

but slow advancement, toward political truth

and the breaking down of feudalbondage. This

progress was more rapid in England than in any

other country, but even there, it crept with reluc—

birthright. This glorious illumination resulsted,
ﬁnally, in the separation of the colonies from
England and the independence of America; The
success of our government in making a people
prosperous and happy, has shaken down the
French monarchy, to be rebuilt, indeed, but with
no feudal attributes. It has done much to modify
the institutions of England, and to infuse prin-

CHAPTER XXXVII.
France

View in Paris.

BEFORE I proceed to give an account of our
American government, it may be well to look a
little more,-pa:1'ticularly into some of the leading
governments of .Europe.l We will begin with that
of France. X i ' i

This monarchy began with Pharamond, Wel;1’(')°'»,[

led into France, as has been stated, a tribe of

eFranks, about 420, who there established them-,

selves. Clovis, one of his successors, who began

his reign in 480, having established his govern-A

mentand adopted Christianity, is sometimes re.
garded as the founder of the kingdom.
11

122 A FRANCE.

The system of government was entirely feudal;
the barons being held dependant upon the crown,
and the whole people remaining ina state of vas-
salage to the barons. Pepin the Short reduced
the petty kings, occupyingthe country beyond the
limits of the dominion of his predecessors; and his
son, Charlemagne, who ﬂourished about the year
800, conquered nearly the whole of Germany.
  The successors of Cliarlemagne did not exercise
dominion beyolid the p1'iese11t limits of the king-
dom, but ]3‘rance was now one of the leading

powers of Etirope, and it rapidly advanced in
population, refineiueut, and wealth. In the pro—
gress of time, the power of the king greatly 111+

creased, while thatilof the ibarons was'],g1‘adL1a1ly
redticed. There was, howev.er, in this p1'O-(lees,

little or no .ad.vancen1ent toward the enjoymeiit of f

liberty on the part of the people.
Louis XIV., called the great, was one of the

most powerful and acconiplished sovereigns of L

France, and the period of his reign is esteemed
the highest point of glory in the history of the
monarchy. He came to the throne in 1642, at
the age of four years, and reigned 73 years.
His life was divided between efforts for the ..en~
largement of his dominions by conqu.es_t, and .d.e¥
votion to every species of pomp and luxury.

' It was this king who built the palace .of Ver-
sailles, which was, and still is, one of the won-
ders of human ,a..1‘t. The Sums of money squan-
dered upon this ediﬁce, and the gar.d.ens and fur»-
niture attached to it,3i.a1no-uiited to hundreds of
millions of dollars; yet this palace is now either
a burthen, or a useless appendage to the throne of
France.

FRANCE. T 123

The kings of this country had been, hitherto,
little less than absolute, and the nobility possessed
almost the wealth and power of princes. These
had engrossed nearly all the lands, except the
royal domains; and the tenants of these were still
but vassals, subject to their despotic lords, and
treatedrby them almost with as little feeling of
justice as if they had been beasts of burthen. >

The king exercised the most arbitrary sway

over all classes of the nation. He could take the

lives of even the greatest nobles, if not without
the form of trial, at least Without the shadow of
justice. He had but to command his ministers to
make out a Warrant, and, signing. his own name,
it was suﬂicient to send the proudest peer in the
realm to the Bastile‘ or the block.

The Bastile was a gloomy castle in Paris, built
in 1383; and perhaps abetter idea of the tyranny
of the government cannot be given, than by a
sketch of the history of this famous prison. Per-
sons vvere shut up in this horrid dungeon by the
authority of Ze2fz‘7"e.s' de cachet‘; that is, letters of ar-
rest, Written in the king’s name, with blanks for
the name of individuals; these were ﬁlled up by
the ministers who possessed these letters.

Heads of families among the nobility, who
Wished to conﬁne any member of the family,
claimed the privilege of conﬁnement by a letzre dc
can/tea‘, and this privilege Was next claimed by the
ministers of government, to be used for the pun-
ishment of refractory servants and others.

It will be easily conjectured that it fwas not
long before unprincipled ministers abused this
right,‘ by imprisoning worthy persons, '§Wh‘O, in the
actual discharge of their duties, had ‘incurred the

displeasure of men of power by thwarting their
mterests.. ~ , s r

In fact, the Zettres ale cachet were long the main
stay of despotism, and they were used, not merely

pbythe crown, but by many of its satellites, Men

were imprisoned for offences too triﬂing to be
registered, and remained thirty or forty years in
the Bastile, or even till‘ death, Without any ex-
amination being instituted into the charges on
which they were imprisoned.

A remarliable instance of this is furnished in
the historyof the celebrated “Iron mask,” the

most singular prisoner ever confined within the.

walls of the Bastile; in respect to whom‘, notwith-
standing all the curiosity and conjecture that have
been employed to ascertain his quality and pedi-
gree, nothing authentic has transpired to the pres-
ent time. ln 1698 he was brought from the island
of St. Marguerite, by Monsieur de St. Mars, the
newly-appointed governor of the Bastile. He was
attended with the greatest respect, maintained a
sumptuous table, and had every possible indul-
gence shown him until the time of his death, Nov.
19, 1703. s

V p This mysterious prisoner, on his removal to the
T'Bastile, was carried in a litter, accompanied by

several men on horseback, who had orders to put
him to death if he made the slightest attempt to
show his face, or otherwise discover himself. His
face was concealed with a mask of black velvet,
with springs of steel, which were so constructed
that he could eat ‘without taking it off.   _
A physician of the Bastile, who had often at-

tended him,said he had never seen his face,
though he had frequently examined his tongue,‘

and other parts of his body; but added, that he i

was admirably well made; that his skin was
brown, his voice interesting; thathe was very

accomplished, read much, played on the guitar, ~

and had an exquisite taste for lace and ﬁne linen.

The pains taken in his concealment show that»

he was a personof considerable quality and im-
portance; and from the following circumstances it
appears singular that he was never discovered.‘
Whilst at St. Marguerite, heone day wrote some-
thing‘ with his knife on a silver plate, which he

threw from the window toward a boat lying near.

the tower. A ﬁsherman took up the plate and

brought. it to the governor, who, with great aston— i

ishment, asked the man if he had read the wri-

* ting, or showed it to any one; and, although the

ﬁsherman answered in the negative, he waskept

in conﬁnement until the governor was perfectly

satisﬁed, after which he dismissed him, saying,
“ It is lucky for you that you cannot read!” .
The Abbe Papon says, “In the year 177 8 I had
the curiosity to visit the apartment of this unfor-
tunate prisoner. It looks towards the sea. I
found in the citadel, an officer in the independent
company there, seventy-nine years of age. He
told me that his father had often related to him,
that a young lad, a barber, having seen one day

something white ﬂoating on the water, took it up. .
It was a very ﬁne shirt, written almost all over;
he carried it to Mons. de St.,l\/Iars, who, having .

looked at some parts of the writing, asked the
lad, with an appearance of anxiety, if he had not
hadthe curiosity to read it. He. answered him

he had not; but,‘two days afterwards, the boy f

was found dead in his bed.

certain rules, becomes a strong one at an early
period. .

This notion is deepened by the innate perception
of right, implanted in every human bosom. As
the eye perceives light, and pronounces it to be
good, the soul perceives right, and pronounces it
to be good also. As the mind is irresistibly inﬂu-
enced by the objects which light discloses, the soul
is irresistibly inﬂuenced by‘ the sense of right
which the bosom ﬁnds and feels within. -

Now, the child very soon perceives the utility 

of family government; the necessity of obedience,
even for his own advantage; the obligation to obey
from love, gratitude, and respect to parents, and
from a regard to the good of the little empire of
home. He sees that to obey is right, and feels
constrained by that perception of ﬁtness within,
to yield obedience-   . c

To these several strands, which are braided
together, and constitute, the motives to obedience,

We may add that of habit—the habit of yielding to

authority, to magistracy, to law; and the habit

is created and established under the family gov-
ernment. Thus the ﬁreside is a little kingdom,
of which the parents are the sovereigns and the
children the subjects. Here, children get their
ﬁrst ideas of government, of laws, _.of right and
Wrong, of justice and injustice, of Qgbedience and
disobedience. Here the first ideas of*.i6blig,ation».sto
regulate our conduct by certain ﬁxed rules are

presented; here the habit of acting in obedience to

such rules is ﬁrst established.

It is no doubt a part of the plan of d=ivine.I5r’o:vie,

Immediately after the prisonepfs death, his ap~
parel, linen, clothes, inattresses, and everything
that had been used by him, were burnt; the Walls

of his l'OO,fI1.WE‘}I‘6 scraped, the floor was taken up,

and every precaution used, that no trace of him
might be left behind. , t _ ,

When he was on the road from “St; Marguerite
to his last residence, Mons. de St. Marstvas oVer—
heard to reply to a question of the prisoner rela.—
tive to any design against his life, “ No, prinoe,
your life is in safety; youjrnust only allow your-

self to be conducted.”

A prisoner told M. La GrangecChancel, that he
was lodged, with other prisoners, in the room im-
mediately over this celebrated captive, and found
means of speaking to him by the vents of the
ehimney; but he refused to inform them who he
was, alleging, that it would cost him his own life,
as well as the lives of those to whom the secret
might be revealed. a

Various are the conjectures that have been made

as to who the masked prisoner was. Some have

said he was the Dulce de Beaufort; others, the

Count de Vermandois, a foreign minister; and

others, the Duke of Monmouth. Collateral facts,
nevertheless, demonstrate that neither of these
could have been the person. Voltaire, who has
expressly written on this mysterious affair, says
that the secret was known to Monsieur de Cha-
tmillard; and that the son—in—latv of that minister
conjured him, on his death-bed, to tell him the
name of the man with the mask ; but he replied
that it was a state secret, which he had sworn
never to divulge. l ' t  

From the account given in a work published in

FRANCE. = 

‘Paris, in 1790, it appears that this unfortunate

person was, probably, the twin brother of Louis
XIV., born eight hours after this monarch, and
who was the unhappy victim of superstition and
cruelty. His father, Louis XHL, being weak
enough to give credit to the prediction of some
irnpostors, that if the queen should have twin

children, thekingdom would be involved in civil .

War, ordered the birth of this prince to be kept a
profoilnd secret, and had him privately educated
infthe country, as the illegitimate son of a noble»
‘man; but on theaccession of Louis XIV.,'the
young man gave indications of having discovered
his parentage, of which his brother being inform-
ed, ordered him to be imprisoned for life, and to
wear a mask in order to prevent his being recog-
nised. .

At the commencement of the French Revolu-
tion, the attention of the public was drawn to the
Bastile, and in July, 1789, the people assembled in
force,and compelled it to surrender. The gov-

THE history of government in France, since the
reign of . Louis XIV., is a tale of blood, butit is
full of instruction. The ~Wa.rs and schemes of ag-
grandizement of this selﬁsh king, had involved the

nation in a Weight of debt which could only issue

in destruction. ,

Louis the XVI. assumed the crown of France,
in 1774, under the most unfortunate auspices.
He found a court abandoned to the utmost extrav-—
agance, and the country loaded with an enormous
debt. The king convoked an assembly of the
Notables, consisting of princes, deputies chosen

from among , the nobility, digniﬁed clergy, the
parliaments, and the pays cl’ ezat, or country land-
holders. ’ A

It was proposed to establish a land tax, without
any exception in favor of the nobility or clergy.
This proposal being followed by a general refusal,
the assembly of the notables was dissolved, and
Necker, the minister, thought he could make a

more advantageous bargain with the parliamentsa
But as the latter remonstrated, and advanced 
opinion that the right of imposing new taxesaiibes

longed only to the States'General, the king con»
voked them in 1789. ' 
Necker’s indiscreet measure, by which it was
stipulated that the members of the tiers em! (the
third order) should be, at least, equal to the other
two orders conjointly, threw the preponderance
into the scale of the former, who did not fail to
find many adherents in the superior classes. As

soon as the deputies of the third order had formed

themselves into a National Assembly, the other
orders were overruled, and the balance of the

legislative branches of the government was thus

entirely destroyed. g

The storm of popular fury gathered and broke
rapidly.» The Bastile was taken and destroyed in
Julty, as stated. On the 4th of August the privi-
leges of the nobility were suppressed... On the 5th
of October, 1789, the king, queen, and royal family
were forced from Versailles by the mob, and
brought captive to the capital. However, the
monarch disconcerted the schemes of his 3tdversa—
ries by a free acceptance of the new constitution,
which abolished the feudal. system and the titles
of nobility. 

130 FRANCE--THE REVOLUTION.‘

The situation of Louis and his family became
so insupportable under the harsh restraints which
were imposed, that they contrived to escape from
their implacable enemies; but the unfortunate
monarch, being, recognised at St. Menehould, by
Drouet, the postmaster, was stopped at Varennes,
constrained to return to Paris with his family,
and to become a mere prisoner. , ,

VVhile theking was preparing to surrender his
throne and life, the jacobins caused a decree to
be enacted, suppressing the chasseurs and gren-
adiers, of whom they were afraid, as well as the
staff of the national guard. All the measures
which they pursued, till the 10th of August 1792,
had, for their sole aim, the overthrow of the men»
archy. -

o On that day, the Marseillese, who had been in-
vitedto Paris to form the advanced guard in the
attack on thepalace of the Tuilleries, in conjunc-

tion with the national guards, ﬁred on the devoted

Swiss who composed the royal body-guard, and
almost annihilated them. The king and his fam-
ily sought refuge in the assembly ; it was decreed
that they should be imprisoned in the Temple,
and they were conducted thither.

The national convention was opened on the 21st
of September, and, in the first sitting, abolished
royalty, and proclaimed the Republic. The king
was tried and condemned, and on the 21st of Jan-
uary, 1793, he perished on the scaffold. The
last words which his confessor, the Abbe Edge-
worth, addressed to him were, “ Son of St. Louis,
ascend to heaven!” A ‘

and speedily after by Spain and Russia, While
France was pressed on all sides by the diﬁbrent
powers of Europe, this unfortunate country was a
prey to all kinds of internal disorders, and to the
most unbounded licentiousness.  
Robespierre and Danton obtained a decree by
which all the sans-calotz‘es——-the common people»-»
were to be a1'med with pikes and muskets at the
expense of the rich, who were themselves to be
disarmed, as suspected persons. Towards the
close of June, 1793, the new constitution was
adopted, and great disturbances broke out at
Lyons, Marseilles, and in La Vendee. V
About this period the Committee of Public Safe»

ty was established, which proceeded to desolate
France by the most horrid butcheries and perse- ‘

cutions. They apprehended all suspected persons,
and tried them by revolutionary committees, the
powers of which were so unlimited’, that they
could readily seize on four ﬁfths of the population
of France. A ' ‘

One of their early victims was the unhappy

Marie Antoinette, the widow of the murdered,

Louis. Her death was followed by the destruc-
tion of those who belonged, to a party called Gi-
rondists; The infamous duke of Orleans, a relative
of the king, ‘was brought up to Paris from Mar-

seilles, and, being tried and condemned, braved

of the convention in the city of Lyons, exceeded»

all that can be conceived; at the end of ﬁve
months, nearly 6,000 persons had perished.

in Paris the executions were now multiplied to
such a degree thatieighty persons were frequently
conveyed in the same vehicle to the place where
they suffered. To cite the names of all the illus-
trious victims who fell, would far exceed our lim-
its, and, at the same time, present too horrid a
picture of human depravity. At length Robes-

directory, were appointed; but the other powers
of Europe being still in league against France,
and the new government being unfortunate in the
field, the executive power was, in 1799, vested in
three consuls, of whom the ﬁrst was the victorious
Napoleon Buonaparte. 0

It is not necessary to trace the history of this

remarkable individual. It is sufficient to say that

he soon overturned the government that had risen
upon the wreck of the monarchy, and established
a military despotism, of which he became the

head. He was crowned emperor in 1808, and,

from this period, devoted himself with amazing
energy to the formation ‘of a system of laws,’ the
improvement of roads, and other internal ~improve~—

merits; the extension of commerce and manufac-»
tures, and to foreign conquest. In all these he
was generally successful, till, having been defeat-
ed in an irivasion of Russia, he was driven back
to France, and after various events was ﬁnally
defeated at Waterloo, in 1815.

Louis XVIIL, brother of Louis XVI., was re-
stored to the throne of his family; but in 1825 he
died, and was succeeded by his brother, Charles X.

The misfortunes of the Bourbons had not taught

them wisdom; , and Charles, fancying that hecould
exercise tyranny as his father had done, caused
an edict to be issued restraining the libertysof the
press.   .
Aninsurrection immediately broke out, and in
three glorious days ‘a revolution was achieved.
Charles ﬂed to England, and Louis Philippe, duke
of Orleans, was chosen king. A charter, or con-—
stitution, was formed, and is now the basis of the
government.   The crown is hereditary, but its
power is limited by a parliament consisting of a
house of - commons, chosen by the people, and a
house of lords, consisting of peers, whose titles
continue only during their lives.

This recent history of France is full of instruc-
tion. It shows that tyranny, carried to a certain

point, is sure to bring those who exercise it to

destruction, while it involves whole nations in
unutterable miseries.   V  
The French revolutionwas thenecessary result

of‘ the accumulated wrongs which the nation had
suffered forages from their rulers. The people

by one act hurled the monarchy to the earth; but,

unaccustomed to self—government, themselves vi~

cious and corrupt, they became the dupes of other

elaimed to rule by divine right. ,

In the midst of anarchy and confusion, one
mighty hand seizes upon the reins. of government,
and calling to his aid the force of the bayonet,
subjects the whole country to his sway. I-Iis
grasping gamb-ition arouses the nations, and he,
too,‘ is prostrated, like a pyramid hurled into
atoms, and levelled with the dust.  

The ancient monarchy is now restored. 4 Again
the king resorts to an act of tyranny, and again
the tempest of revolution bursts upon the people.
But, amid all this confusion, something has been
learned. Some progressrhas been made in the ed»
ucation of the people in the art of self-government,
and now they are able to secure the advantages
of their triumph over a despotic ruler, The result
of this second revolution in France, was the se-
euring of a charter, or a constitution, which is a
barrier to the power of the crown, and a protec-=
tion to the liberties of the people. Thus the gov-
ernnient of France has become a limited, or con-.
stitutional, monarchy, instead of a despotic one,
as it was-, in effect, down to the time of Louis

XVI.

The lower house, in the legislative branch, is»

called the Chambers of D'ep:uti.—-es; the upper house,
the Chamber of Peers. The peers are nominated
by the king. The whole number of persons who
vote fora.deputi_,es, is but about 130,000. The forms
and modes of proceeding in the French parliament,
are similar to those in the British parliarneriigt;

THE political history of Great Britain is worthy
of the mostattentive perusal; for here We shall
see the best delineations of the struggles of man»
kind for liberty, to be found in the records of the

human family. Here we shall also find the germs 

of our own political institutions; and seeing how
mighty»has been the cost at which freedom has
been discovered and vindicated, we shall learn t
appreciate the blessings we enjoy. a , '
The ﬁrst knowledge of Britain appears to have
been acquired in the time of Caesar, who partially
conquered the country about ﬁfty years before

- Christ. Succeeding generals completed this con-

quest, and it became a Roman province.

should thus be laid deep andstrong at the ﬁreside;
for this is the sheet anchor? of society.~ A child
that has not learned obe_dience to parents is not
likely to be a good memberifof society, and to obey
the laws of civil government. A child in Whose
heart the perceptionfof right has not been cher-
ished and. cultivated at home, _is hardly likely to
grow up a just and honest citizen. F a

it is therefore a matter for parents to consider,
that the highest possible obligation rests upon
themto teach their children obedience to law--—to
the law of right, Of? justice 3 Z the law of ‘,‘ do to 'an-

other as you would have another do to you.’ ’ It
is the duty of parents to render this obedience pa.

matter of principle and habit. All this is a duty

trequired by God, as well to children as to society.

 And it is a thing for children to consider also,
that they are bound to learnobedience to parents.

They are bound to learn to bow to the obligations

of justice; they are bound to obey parents; to
obey God; to obey the laws‘ of the land. a Obedi-
ence is the great lesson, and it is equally required
by our duty to our parents, ourselves, our Cre-
ator,‘ and our country. i i

136 GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND.

Rome held possession of the country till about

A. D. 450, when she was herself prostrated by  

the Ggoths and Vandals. '.During'tl1is period she
had partially civilized the Britons, who, like the
Gauls, were Celts, living ina nearly savage state.
No longer protected by the Romans, Britain fell a
prey to the Danes, and afterwards to the Saxons,
who established their dominion in the country. _

During these events, the population of England
became a mixture of the original Britons, Romans,

Danes and Saxons, though the last constitute by _
farthe largest ingredient. Alfred the great, of t

the Saxon line, may be regarded as the founder of
the English monarchy, and as the author of many
of its best. institutions. '

He was the youngest son of Ethelwolf, king of
the West Saxons, and was born at Wantage, in
Berkshire. He Went to Rome at the age of ﬁve
years, and was anointed by the pope, although he
then had an elder brother. However, in 872 he
ascended the throne.

This was an unpropitious time, for the power
of the Danes was then great and employed in har-
assing the Saxons, Whose country they ravaged
in various directions. Alfred concluded some

treaties with them, but they were not kept; and,

unable to make head against the invaders, he was
compelled to ﬂy, and in concealment to await a
moment when his re-appearance would be advan
tageous forhis country.  

In the disguise of a harper he penetrated the
Danish camp, to gain information of the strength

of hisfoes, and,-having satisﬁed himself, directed
his nobles and their vassals to assemble at Sel-

wood. Here he headed the troops, and attalckin-go

the Danes at Eddington, gained a signal victory.

Hes permitted those Danes who.,,were willing to

embrace the Christian religion, to remain in the
kingdom of East Anglia, which he surrendered to
them.

He built forts to secure his subjects, augmented
and strengthened his navy, and established the
prosperity of London on a ﬁrm basis. He met
and defeated the Danes, who still persisted in at-
tempting to obtain footing in England, and made
his name a terror to thepirates; he fought ﬁfty-
six -battles by sea and land, in every one of which
he was personally engaged. i ’

His zeal for the reformation of laws and man-
ners, is as honorable to him as his military prow-
ess. He composed a code of laws, instituted the

trial by jury, and divided England into shires and

tithings. So successful. were his regulations that
it is said the crime of robbery was unknown, and
the most valuable goods might be exposed upon

the highway, without any dread of thieves. Al-

fred formed a parliament, which met at London
semi-annually.

He was an ardent lover of learning, and was
himself a distinguished scholar. To promote it,

he invited learned men from all parts, and estab’-.-

lished schools throughout his kingdom. He is
said to have been the founder of the University of
Oxford, or, at least, to have exalted it to aheight
which it had never before attained. He composed
severalworks, and translated others for the beneﬁt
of his subjects.

‘ He was industrious and fond of. order, dividing
thetwenty-four hours. into three portions ;, one de-
voted to religious duties, another to public affairs,

and the t-hird, to rest. Alfred laid the foundation
of the navy of England, by building galleys of T a
size superior to any others of the age. In private
life he was distinguished by piety, affability, and

cheerfulness. His person was commanding and

stately.

William, duke of Normandy, laid claim to the
‘crown of England in .1066. Landing with an
army he triumphed in the famous battle of Hast-
ings, and was seated upon the throne, thus estab-
lishing a dynasty of French kings. He brought
with him many French nobles, and encouraged
others to settle in the country. He also adopted
the7French language as that -of theicourit, the gov-
ernment, and the bar. Thus French manners
became grafted upon those of the English; and the
‘English tongue ‘received that infusion of French
Words and idioms which appear to the present
day.

JoHN came to the throne 1199. He ‘was a de-
testable tyrant, and even the barons, usually the
supporters of the crown, right or wrong, united
against him. Tired out with his exactions‘ and
his Weaknesses, they called on him to sign a paper,
securing certain rights and privileges to them-
selves and the people. i

This John refused to do, but at last, ﬁnding
himself abandoned by everybody, and in a most

desolate condition, he sent the earl of Pembroke,
a nobleman distinguished for virtue and ability,
to propose a conference with the barons. A meet-
ing accordingly took place on Friday, the 15th.of
June, 1215, in a large meadow between Windsor
and Staines, called Runnymede, which means the
meadow of council. This was so called because
it .had been used by the Saxons as a place for
public meetings. At this meeting was signed the
famous Magma C’/zarta. « kg m

.The charter itself is in Latin. ‘ The reader
would hardly care to see the whole, but I will
give some brief particulars respecting it. It must

be borne in mind that, under the feudal system,

the power of the kings was very oppressive, and
had become more and more so, till no subject
could act in the commonest affairs of life without
the king’s consent, and this could be obtained only
for money.

We may suppose the sort of interference the
king had inevery person’ s concerns, when we are
told that nobody could marry without his consent;

and that he could oblige heiresses to marry whom’

he liked; and even widows, who often paid ﬁnes
to save themselves from being compelled to marry
again.

We read of a countess of Chester who paid king
Stephen ﬁve hundred marks, that she might not
be obliged to marry again for ﬁve years; and of a
countess of Warwick who paid king John ﬁve
hundred marks, that she might not be obliged to

marry till she’ pleased. Justice of every kindwas.

bought and sold, like any other commodity.
The object of the magma charta was to put a.
stop to these ﬁnes and oppressions. It contained

140 . ENGLAND.

sixty-three different clauses; and when I have
told what a few of them were, the reader will
easily comprehend the degree of vexatious tyranny
the kings had been accustomed to exercise over the
people, and which alone could make such” clauses

necessary. a

The following are examples : That the goods of
every free man shall be disposed of, after his death,
according to his will; that, if he die without mak»
ing a will, his children shall succeed to his prop-

erty : that no officer of the crown shall take horses,

carts, or wood, without the consent of the owner:

that no free man shall be imprisoned, outlawed, or
banished, unless by the judgment of his peers, or

the law of the land: that even a rustic shall not’,

by any ﬁne, be bereaved" of his carts, ‘ploughs, and.

implements of husbandry. This last was the only
article in that great charter for the protection of
the laboring people! The invidious word ‘-‘even,"’
shows, plainly, how little they were considered or
thought of at that period.

From. the time of John, England‘ continued to
make-slow, but certain advances in civilization,

and in the art of government. But still the feu—.
Vdal system continued to exist, modiﬁed and'soft-

ened, though in a high degree oppressive. The

power of the king and the privileges of the nobles,

swallowed up the rights of the nation. I

But there was a point beyond which the people
of England would not now endure oppression;
and in 1649, Charles I. was brought to the block.
The government was seized upon by the strong
hand of Oliver Cromwell, who, ' by a singular
mixture of hypocrisy and wisdom, had acquired

great inﬂuence overthe nation. For several years

PRESENT srarn or THE BRITISH EMPIRE. 141

he ruled the country with the title of Protector, but
with the despotism of a king. It is to be remark-
ed, however, that his public policy had for its end
the prosperity of the nation; and England cannot
boast a sovereign whose rule has redounded
more to the benefit of the country, than that of the
nsurper, Cromwell.

  Charles II. was restored in 1660; and since
that time, under various sovereigns, Great Britain
has continued to advance in power, and may now
be considered the most formidable kingdom upon.
the globe. If, indeed, We look to the high pitch

of civilization to which she has attained, the ex-»

tent of her navy and her armies, her means of
carrying on war, -her inﬂuence in the councils of
nations, her commerce and her vast possessions,
We must admit that the World has neversbefore pre»
sented such a spectacle of political greatness, in

a single nation, of either ancient or modern times.

A CH;APTEIi XLI,
Present State of I the British Empire.

THE British empire embraces not only England,
Ireland, and Scotland, which constitute what is
called the home country, but a range of colonies
and dependencies in all quarters of the globe.

England may be considered the central and
principal portion of the empire. United to 'Wales
it contains ﬁfty-two counties, and a population of
about fourteen millions. Scotland, which was
incorporated with England in 1707, contains thirty—

 PRESENT STATE OF THE BRITISH l3MPIRE'.

three counties, and a population of about two and
a half millions. Ireland, which was conquered by
the English at an early period, but not united
under the same legislative system till 1800, con—
tains thirty-two counties, and a population of nine
millions. .

The oldest existing colonies of Britain are those
of the West Indies, chieﬂy consisting of a series
of islands stretching across the Great Bay» which
nearly divides North from South America. Ja-
maica, the largest and most important of these
islands, contains about four hundred thousand in»
habitants, of which only about thirty-seven thou-
sand are White people ; the rest being negroes, the
most of whom were originally slave laborers.
Barbadoes, Trinidad, and the other West lndia
colonies, are less populous; thefull amount being,
in each case, divided in about the same propor-
tions between blacks and whites.

Half a million of square miles of the peninsula
of Hindostan, containing a population of a hun-
dred millions, have, in i the course of the last cen-—
tury and the present, fallen under the power of
the association of English merchants, called the
East India Company, who, by virtue of a charter
from the government, administer the affairs of the
natives, in Whose revenue they enjoy a source of
vast wealth. A. still larger portion of Hindostan
is under the protection, but not the direct govern-
ment, of the company. ‘ I

Goods to the value of four millions of pounds
are annually exported from Britain to the East
Indies; while goods to the value of above six
millions of pounds are imported from the East
llndies to Britain. A revenue of above twenty—

PRESENT STATE or THE BRITISH EMPIRE. 143

two millions of pounds is annually drawn from
that country. A dependency of so much territorial
value, so numerous a population, and so large a
revenue, was never before possessed by any coun-
try. It is, perhaps, a question, whether the pros—-
perity and happiness of the people have been
greatly advanced by their British rulers.

Next in importance and antiquity among the
British dependencies, are the two provinces of
Upper and Lower Canada, and the colonies of
Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, Prince Edward’s Isl—
and, Newfoundland and New Brunswick; all of
which form portions of North America. iThese
coloniesare chiefly occupied by British emigrants

and their descendants; the total population being

somewhat more than a million, and rapidly ‘in-
creasing. A

In New South Wales, Van Dieman’s Land, and
other Australian colonies, Britain” possesses a mil»
lion and a half lofsquare miles, occupied by a white
population of about ﬁfty thousand. At the Cape
of Good Hope and other possessions in Africa, she
has ninety thousand square miles, and a hundred
and ﬁfty thousand inhabitants. ‘In the Mauritius,

«an island in the Indian Ocean, formerly a slave

colony, there is a population of a hundred thoi1—
sand, mostly negroes. A The Ionian Islands, .l\/lalta,
and Gibraltar, in the Mediterranean, and the small
islands of Ascension and St. Helena, in the Atlan-
tic Ocean, complete the sum of the British foreign
possessions. —

The importance attained by the British in the

scale of nations, appears to depend mainly upon

two features of the national character——their intel-i

lectual and moral advancement, and their extra-or~

dinary industry and skill in producing articles of
necessity and luxury, as well as their dexterity in
the commerce by which these are diffused over
the World. The genuine British character, taken
all in all, is one of ‘probity, intelligence and ac-
tivity, and is adapted to the attaininent of supreme»
acy and the establishment of good i.nstitut.ions.,

GOVERNMENT or GREAT BRITAIN. 145

"V The EXECUTIVE-——that is, the powers by which
the laws are enforced—~is entrusted by the-nati-on
to an hereditary monarch.

The LEGisLArUaE—that is, the power by which
the laws are created——consists of three distinctbut
combined powers: 1, a H0l.l88 of. Commons, com-
posed of six hundred and ﬁfty-eight gentlemen,
elected by certain portions of the people; 2, a
House of Peers, composed of the hereditary nobles
of England, the English archbishopsland bishops,
a certain number of lords representing the Scottish
and Irish peerage, and a certain number of spirit-
ual lords representing the Irish hierarchy; and
ﬁnally, 3, the King. V t‘ i  

The House of Commons and Peers, otherwise
styled the lower and upper houses, form a com-
pound deliberative body, called Parliament, which
is liable to.be called together, and prorogued or
dissolved at=the king’s pleasure.

These law—making and law-executing powers
combine, in one system, called the Brihlsiz ?‘G'on—
sii2;‘u.ti07t, a variety of political principles, which are
usually found acting singly. The House of Com-

mons, as a partial representation‘ of the people, may

‘be said to be founded on theprinciples of demitocr-acy;
rarpeople sovereignty. The House of Peers, which
is independent of direct ‘- 'popula:r‘*c-ent1‘ol, presents
the principle of aristocracy, or noblesoverreignty,
while the king contributes the inonarchical princi-
ple, or sovereignty of one.  

It must be allowed, in explanation of a system
so extraordinary, that the particular portions of the
constitution havenot always borne the same" rela-
tive‘ power, and that principles naturally so ;i:1§1;c:on—

ages, and which has, on the Whole, secured the

In early times, the king» possessed the chief inﬂuw

an ObSBq1l:l:Ou-S~ council of the sovereign, than an
ind-ependent, body». At the revolution of 1688, the
strength of the smcnarehye was d-iminished~ by a.
breach of the hereditary line, and the Parliament
became the predominant power. As the nobility

 superior gen»-try; had then the chief inﬂuence

in both houses of’ Parliament, it might be said that
the a1‘istocra..tice principle had become ascendent,

b It continued to be so, till the passing of the reforrn

jerity of the House of Commoner being extended to
 middle, classes of the people, the democratic
}91?iBGi{{)1B‘W3eS, for the ﬁrst time, brought into at;
considerable degree of force.

The House of Commons is composed of four
hundred and   seVenty—one members for England,
of whom. three hundred and tWenty—four are for
boroughs, one hundred and forty—three for counties,
and four for uniV.er,sities.; twenty-nine members
for Wales, of Whom fourteen, are for boroughs, and
fifteen for counties;_ one hundred and ﬁve for
Ireland, of Whom thirty-nine are for boroughs,
s__iXty—four for coun':t=ies, and two for the Dublin
university; and ﬁfty"-three for Scotland, of Whom
twenty-three are forcities and boroughs, and thirtyf
for counties: six hundred and ﬁfty-eight in all.

The constituency, thatiis, the body of voters by
which the members are‘ elected,» is about twelve
hnnd+red— thousand in. number, or one twentieth of
the; Whole population. The qualiﬁcations of an,-

occupation of lands or tenements in England for
any period, and in Scotland for nineteen years, at

an annual rent of not less than fifty pounds.

The qiialiﬁcatioii of an elector in boroughs, is the’
occupation of a house of ten pounds annual rent;
the resident freemen in English and Irish boroughs-i
being _ also allowed to vote, The utmost duration
to which a Parliament can extend is seven years ;,
and a new House of Commons must be elected
within six months after the commencement of every
new reign. The king, however, fifequently exerci-—

lses his prerogative in dissolving Parliament a cone

siderable time beforeethe expiration of the full period
a:1low'ed to it by law.  e
The House of Lords consisted, in 1833, of four

hund.—red and twenty-six lords, of whom four Were:

dukes of the<blood—royal, three archbishops, twenty-
one dukes -of English title, nineteen marquises-,:.
one hundred and nine ‘earls, eighteen viscounts,

barons, sixteen Scottish peers, and twenty-eight‘
Irish peers. The king possesses the power of
creating peers, and of I-lQl1‘llIla:t*lﬁg_ the bishops.
The Scottish. representative peers are elected by

the whole body oftheopeerage of that country, at‘=~-

the commencement of every new Parliament, or one

tive peers are elected also by thewhole-body of that

peerage of their country,but for life. The Irish
spiritual peers sit in rotation. _

The king is not onlyat the head of the executive;
he is also the head of the church, the commander
of thearmy, the dispenser of all titles of honor, and
even, by a fiction of the law, the person of Whom

all the landed property in his dominions is held.

The queen has the same power as a king.

In the right of appointi-ng the bishops, the judges,
the lords lieutenant, and justices of peace of counties,
the officers of the army and navy, and many officers
and public servants, the king possesses a large

* amount of patronage, which conduces, in no small

degree, to the maintenance» of his authority. He
has also the sole right of declaring peace or war,
though, in the latter instance, he is effectually
controlled by the House of Commons, which imay
give or withhold the requisite funds, as it sees
proper.

S Out‘ of respect for the hereditary principle and
the royal character, it is held that the king cannot
of himself do any Wrong, or be personally called to
account for his actions. The responsibility for the
performance of his functions rests with a body of
servants chosen by himself, and designated his
ministers, who cannot continue in that character

CHAPTER CXLIII.

Legislature and Judiciary J of Great Britain.

THE two houses of Parliament usually sit, during
a considerable portion of every year, in deliberation
upon the affairs of the country, and for the enact-
ment of new, or the repeal of old laws. {Any
member of either house may propose a new law ;
but this duty is chiefly undertaken by the king’s
ministers, and it is in the lower house, that new
laws are usually proposed; ’

it passes on to the other, which may receive, ‘rejecst,

the three branches of the legislature, it is called an
Act of Parliament, and becomes part of the laws
of the country.

The -bills for the pecuniary supplies necessary

for the" public service, are introduced exclusively
by the House of Commons: they may be rejected
by the House of Lords ; but for that house to alter
them, or to introduce any bill which involves pecu—

niary supply to the government, is considered a,

breach of the pp-r~ivil;eges of the House of Commons.

The money annually raised by Parliament for
the public service and the payment of the interest
of the nationatl debt, was, in 1760, about nine mil-

lions, and in 1793, seventeen and a ‘half. The sum.

now generally raised, is nearly ﬁfty million of
pounds.

Justice, civil and criminal, is administered in.

England and Ireland according to laws and forms
which took their rise in the former country, and
were iii time :€:Xt;enid«ed to the latter. The English
law, as it is comprehensively termed, is of two
kinds.——wtrittein or statute law, consisting   of the
laws established by act of Parliament, and .c¢msue-

In Scotland, laws ipeeuliar to itself, rfonnded upon
the principles of the Romanand the Feudal law,
are administered by a supreme civil tribunal, de-»
nominated the Court of Session, which remains
ﬁxed at Edinburgh; and by a criminal tribunal,
named the _C'om'z‘ of Jz¢sl=iciary, which not only sits
in the same city, but makes circuits ‘through the
provinces. Minor civil and criminal cases are also
judged in Scotland by the ’sheriﬂ’s of the various

of government were greatly aggravated by the
tyrannical character of many of their sovereigns.

The heir apparent to the throne is called the Prince

of Asturias; the other royal children are called
Infanta. .

In 1837, a new constitution wasformed, intended
to be adapted to the more liberal spirit of the age.

"By this’ charter, a legislature is established, con-

sisting of a senate, called the Cortes, and a congress
of deputies. These bodies united, have the power
of enacting laws with the royal sanction.

I o The senators are chosen by the king from a list
“of persons nominated by the electors. The deputies

are chosen by the electors.

The history of Venice, in Italy, is full of interest.
About the year 421, the people appear to have es-
tablished themselves in numbers, where the city
now stands. The settlement ‘increased, and became
in time, the seat of a powerful state. In the early
period of; its history, the government was ducal,
but in after times, the chief magistrate was a doge,
who was elected for life, from the nobles.

Though Venice was called a republic, yet it
possessed none of the attributes of freedom which
the name implies. The nobility, in fact, ruled the
state, constituting a tyrannical aristocracy. The
history of no despotismt affords instances of more
fearful cruelty and oppression, than that of Venice,
while bearing the title of a republic.  

The government was, however, conducted with
energy, and, as far as it tended to promote the
power of the state, with Sagacity and wisdom. It
encouraged commerce, and thus acquired vast
wealth. The Venetian navy was the most con-

siderable in the world, for several centuries, and it
long gave Venice an ascendency in the Medit’er~

ranean. In 1797, it was taken by the French,

under Bonaparte, and aftervvards was ‘ceded to
Austria, which still holds it, with the adjacent
territory, under the title of the Lombard Venetian
kingdom. , s

~Genoa, was for several “centuries, an independent
state, and like Venice had a doge for its -céhsieif
magistrate. it He was elected for two years, from
among the nobles. This state attained considerable
eminence, and possessed an «extensive navy; its

commerce was earried on with success, and at

some periods, Genoa almost 1'ivIalled Venice.
At the present time, there are several distinct

governments in italy. Scrdivtia is an absolute,.

a chamber of deputies. Tuscany is an absolute

The States of the C’/mrc/L, including the city of
Rome, are governed by the pope, who is elected
by the cardinals ‘from among themselves. His
power is absolute. The kingdom of Naples is also
an absolute monarchy. .

Greece had been for nearly four centuries under
the grinding oppression of the Turks. In 1821,

‘they declared their independence, and after a long

and bloody conﬂict, it was established, and Otho, a
Bavarian prince, became their sovereign in 1830.

divan, or council of state is composed of the rninis—
ters of the interior, exterior and ﬁnance. There
is no security for property; public officers thrive

by extortion. The idea of patriotism is not known

12 SECOND STAGE or LAW AND GOVERNMENT.

A young person in reading a newspaper sees
an account of a man who is seized and hur-
ried away to prison for theft, and learns that
thieving is forbidden by the law. In another
paper the reader ﬁnds an account of some pirates
being hung, because they robbed a vessel upon the
high, seas, and this, too, because such robbery is
against the law. ? n

Thus the law is seen to be everywhere, upon the
land and the;-sea, in town and country; and the
question soon arises, who makes the law? The
answer to this is readily given; it is the govern-
ment. But what is the government? Who is it,
what is it, that has spread this net-work of prohi-
bition and requisition over the land, involving
every member of society in its, meshes? Who
administers the government? Who makes‘ the
government? By what means or instruments does
the government operate? Why do people obey
the government? How does it acquire such uni-
versal and decisive power?

To some, or perhaps all of these questions,
which, one after another, arise in the mind,
young persons gradually obtain answers; but
these are usuallytimperfect and confused. I pro-
pose, therefore, to proceed to describe government,
its origin, nature, and necessity; its various forms

in different parts of the world, and especially that

form adopted in our own country.

,_In the course of this delineation of government,
I shall have occasion to exhibit the origin and‘
svoiurces of laws; the manner of their enactment;
Tandithe means by which they are made to regu-
late the conduct of mankind.

the security of independence. ' The diet, or federal
congress, is composed of deputies from the cantons;

each canton having one vote. The president is

styled the landammann. This diethas nearly the
same power as our congress; but each state or
canton is governed by its own laws. Justice is
generally well administered; but this is more from
the good spirit of the people than from the excellence

of their laws.

Auslrzlz is an absolute despotism; the sovereign
is styled emperor. In some of theprovinces, as in
Hungary and Transylvania, hispower is checked
by a diet._ Justice iswell administered, and the
government generally exercises its authoritywith
mildness. r ‘ v T g  

Prussia is an absolute monarchy; yet the soveiu
eign wields his power with a regard to the interests
of the people. All the men are drilled in "military
exercises, and all are compelled. to go througha
course of education; provided by the government.
There are twenty—two thousand common or primary
schools in the kingdom.

The principal German Smies are united in a
ied.eracy, called the German diet; the ‘object of
which is to secure general tranquillity. T It em-

braces thirty-six monarchical states and four re-y

pnblics, called free cities. .

Ilollcmd and Belgium are monarchies with 1egis~f

latures. Denmark is an unlimited monarchy, with
much practical freedom; the laws are just, and well
administered. Szoeden is alimiteid monarchy. The
diet has some resemblance to the British Parlia-
ment, but is composed of four bodies, meeting in
different houses. These are the nobles‘; clergy,
peasants, and inhabitants of towns. Norway is

Europe, Asia, and Africa. These countries being

called the Old woﬂd, the American continent was

The inhabitants of this entire hemisphere were

of the copper colored race, to whom the name or
Indians was applied. Most of them were in a

savage state, though two extensive empires existed,

Mexico and Peru, both ofrwhich had made con-oi

had‘ cities, the art of Writing by hieroglyphics, a.

that monarch seized upon as much of the new
world as he could grasp. The finest of the West
India islands, the great and rich empires of Mexico
and Peru, and nearly all the rest of South America,
with other territories, were taken by Spain.

, Other portions of the country were seized by
other powers of Europe. France: got possession

‘of the country along the St. Lawrence and the

Mississippi, and England picked here and there
upon the Atlantic border of North America, as
she could ﬁnd a. prize worthy of her notice.

In this greedy scramble, the first object was gold
and silver, which had been found in abundance in
Mexico and Peru. But, after these became scarce,
other objects were sought by the emigrants: some
came for trade, some to cultivate the lands, and
some to escape froni religious persecution, which
was then the great business of kings and priests,
both in England and France. a

The rightsiof the European natives to territory
in America were founded in discovery. Thus, a
ship having been ﬁtted out in England, by com-
mand of the king, proceeded to this continent, a11d
discovered the country from Labrador to Virginia.
England, therefore, claimed all this territory, be»
cause one of her captains thus saw it before any
other European.

By this right of discovery, various ‘European

_ powers got possession‘ of the different parts of
‘ America; and although we cannot see any very
good reason why discovery should confer such

rights, still, when followed by occupancy, it has

ever been regarded as a valid ground of claim, by

civilized countries. ” L
It appears that these European powers did not

ENGLISH COLONIES. 161

consider the Indians as having any other right to
the land which they had inherited and possessed
for ages, but that of occupation. These people
being savages and heathen, were looked upon as

children or incompetent persons, over whom civil-

ized’ and Christian governments had a right to
assume guardianship and control. ~

Perhaps this, in theory, might‘ be vindicated, but
the practice of the European nations toward the
natives was little less than a system of plunder.
The Spaniards generally proceeded at once to con-
quer the natives of the countries of which they took
possession, and thus reduced them to subjection.

The English adopted a system somewhat more
just in appearance, though as destructive in its
results. They purchased the lands of the natives,
but, usually made such sharp bargains that the
whole, inheritance of the tribes was soon bartered
away, and they either perished, or sought other
lands by emigration to thewest. ’ ’

CHAPTER XLVI.

The establishment of the English Colonies.

THE first settlement within theboundaries of the
present United States was made in Virginia, in 1607,
by a company of English emigrants. They settled
on James’ river and built Jamestown. ' ,

These persons took possession of the territory
by virtue of a charter granted to Sir Thomas, Gia'tes
and his associates, by James 1., king of England,
in 1606; for it will be rememberedlthat the‘ ' king

14*   '

162 ENGLISH ooLoN1Es.

  of England claimed the country by virtue of the
. discovery of Cabot, more than a century before. ’

>‘ This charter of king James granted to the Vir-
ginia company the territory between the thirty-
fourth and forty-ﬁfth parallel of latitude, and of
course included the whole Atlantic country, from
the southern point of North Carolina to New
Brunswick. This companywas afterwards di-e
vided, one taking the southern, and the other the
northern portion of this T land. Several distinct
colonies became established within the limits‘ of.
this grant to Sir Thomas Gates and his associates.

New York was settled by emigrants from Hol-
land, in 1613. Their chief object was to trade
with the natives for furs, and the first settlement

was made at Albany. Thenext year, a small‘
company established themselves" on Manhattan-
island, and founded the now populous city of New ‘

York." This settlement of the Dutch was upon
territory claimed by the king of England by the
prior right of discovery, and of course it was es-
teemed an aggression. . The settlement came into

the hands of the English, by cession, in 1644, and

after that, they held it as an English colony.
The first settlement in New England was made
at Plymouth, in Massachusetts, in 1620, by certain

persons called Puritans, who had ﬂed to Holland

on account of religious persecution, and having re-
mained there several years, came to America; They
were soon followed by others from England, and in

T the space of a few years, the colonies of Massachu-

setts Bay, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New
Hampshire were established.
Maryland was settled by about two hundred

Catholics, in 1634, who also came to escape from

ENGLISH COLONIES. 163

religious persecution. New Jersey was settled
about 1664; Pennsylvania in 1684. The ‘latter
colony consisted of Quakers, who made their settle—
ment under the direction of the celebrated and
k.ind—hearted William Penn. Delaware was first
segttled by a company of Swedes and Finns, in
1 27.   *

North Carolina was settled by persons who ﬂed
from religious intolerance in Virginia, between 1640
and 1650. ;In South Carolina; the first permanent
settlement was made at PortRoyaJ., under governor
Teagle; in 1670. Georgia was settled in 1732,.by
poor emigrants sent. thither by an association of
benevolent persons in England-.

Thirteen colonies were thus established in North
America. These consisted of 1. Massachusetts,

which now included the Plymouth colony; 2.

Connecticut; 3. New Hampshire; 4. Rhode Island;
5.New. York; 6. New Jersey; 7. Pennsylvania;
8., Delaware; 9. Maryland; 10. Virginia; 11. North
Carolina; 12. South Carolina; 13. Georgia.
These were the thirteen colonies that declared

7 war against England; in 1776. It will be recollected

that Maine was attached to Massachusetts. Ver-
mont was never a colony ; the territory was claimed
both ‘by New Hampshire and New York; the peo-p

__ple fought against the British in the war; but did

not join the confederation.

CHAPTER XLVII.

General Remarks on Colonies, 860.

IT appears to have been the practice of com-
mercial nations, in very early times, to send out
companies of their people to settle, in distant coun-
tries. As these settlements require protection, they
receive it of the mother country, and, in return,
allow that country to exercise governinent over

them. These settleinentsgoften remote and always.

dependent, are denominated colonies.

The great inducement to found and encourage
colonies, has been, that they promoted trade and
commerce, and thereby increased the wealth of the

nation to whom they belonged. Carthage, estab~

lished a century before Rome, was at first but a
colony of Phoenicia. It afterwards became in~
dependent, and was long the most powerful state
in Africa. It established numerous colonies, par-
ticularly along the coast of Spain, and from those
derived a large share of its prosperity.

Greece, also, had a number of colonies,but her
commerce, as well as her settlements, were chieﬂy
conﬁned within the shores of the Mediterranean
Sea. Rome was never a commercial power, for
she chose rather_ to thrive by conquest than trade.
She had, therefore, no commercial settlements
which could properly becalled colonies.

After the Roman Empire fell into the hands of
the Northmen-———about the year 450--for many
centuries commerce did not ﬂourish, and the whole
world long remained in the darkness of ignorance
and poverty. During the middle ages, the Euro-

GENERAL REMARKS ON COLONIES. 165

pean States had little trade bypsea, and, indeed,
the commerce of the world was chieﬂy carried on
by land. Genoa and Venice are among the most
thriving commercial States of this period, and these
had some colonial settlements.

But it was not till the ﬁfteenth century, that
colonies were established on an extensive‘ scale.
The Portuguese were the ﬁrst to extend their dis-

coveries, and at thatperiod they founded colonies

along the Atlantic borders of Africa, and even in
India. The discovery of America soon followed,
and then a system of colonizing those portions of
the new world which belonged to each .European
power, by virtue of discovery, was adopted.
Thus, the whole continent of America, North
and South, became parcelled out among the differ-«
ent European nations, the settlementsall being
colonies: that is to say, they were all considered

as belonging to European countries; and while

each claimed protection from its particular govern-
ment, it submitted also to the laws prescribed by
that government. ~

This was the situation of the thirteen English
colonies, described in chap. XLVI. These had all
been settled within the territory claimed by Great
Britain, as being discovered under her ﬂag. They

had all claimed the protection of Great Britain,

which was called the mother country; and they
had all submitted to the government of Great
Britain. These colonies were considered of so
much importance to that kingdom, that they were
spoken of as “the brightest jewel in her crown.”

It must be remarked,’however, that the colonists»

generally settled in America, under charters granted
by the king, or obtained some charterat a sub-

CHAPTER III.

The different Conditions of Mankind. The
  Savage State.

 

A PERSON who travels over the world will soon
perceive that the people of diﬂerent countries are
in very different situations. The native Indians
of America for the most part live by hunting; they
do not build permanent houses, but dwell in tents
or Wigwams, and they paylittle attention to the
cultivation of the earth. These people we call

savages, because they are wild, rude, and cruel

in their customs, manners, and feelings.

If We go among these tribes, we shall seecertain
things which always belong to a savage commu-
nity. They have no books, and of course they
cannot read; they have no ships, and carry on no
commerce by sea; they do not build cities 3," they
have no great roads,,canals, or other p11.b_1’i,C';V:“f:Q'1l1§_St’;

sequent period. These charters prescribed the
mutual rights of the colonists and the crown a:
usually extending to the former the English laws,
and empowering the crown to rule over the people
and exercise its authority through a governor and
council of his own appointment. .

It is true, indeed, thatodifferent colonies were differ-
ently situated in respect to the government of Great
Britain ; some having more privileges than others.
Some of them were indeed mere provinces, and
having no charter, or their charters being taken
away, were completely subject to the government
of England; ,while others hada right by their
charters to elect representatives among themselves,
who should constitute an assembly, which, in con-
junction with the governor and council ap.point-
ed by the king, could make laws for the colony,
not incompatible with those of England. We
here see the beginning of that form of government
established by the colonies when they became in-»
dependent states. ,

Hitherto, we must remark that thethirteen cole
onies were dependents. of Great Britain; and most
of them were deprived of some privileges which
belonged to Englishmen, by the very terms and
conditions of their charters- The colonists were,
from the beginning, and of necessity, but little more
than slaves,.so far as their political condition was
concerned. , ,

But even the hard conditions of these charters
were often violated by the home government, and
tyranny; was added to injustice. t This, doubtless,
arose more from the position of the colonies than
from any intrinsic tyranny in the government. In
the first place, colonies are always regarded as in-

rather than for the colonists themselves; and it is
apt to be an habitual train of thought, that they
are to_ be managed with an exclusive or. primary

reference to the good of the mothercountry.
Beside, colonies demand large expenditures for,

their government and protection,and it is deemed

right that they should be made to pay liberallyfor A
these: they are also distant, and if they suffer,

grievances it is difﬁcult for those who are entrench-
ed in power, to be reached by remonstrance or
petition. Add to this, that it is usually for the in-
terest of the agents of the government to misrepre-
sent the people they govern, so that they may

extort power from their employers and plunder-

the people by authority.

Under these circumstances, it is not strange
that the people of the colonies suﬂ’ered greatly from
the oppressions of the home government. They
however ﬂourished. Their numbers increased, as
well by natural progress as ‘by emigration. A
large portion of those who first emigrated were
well educated, and these laid the foundation for
general education. The lands became the property
of those who cultivated them; and thus a deep
interest in promoting the real prosperity of the
country was established in the numerous owners
of the soil. . V . T

The oppressions of the British government had
been submitted to by feeble colonists, whengthe
could not help themselves; but they had at length
become strong, and began to feel‘ thatby union they
could resist with effect. At last, roused, by new
encroachments on their rights, they threw off their

allegiance, and on the 4th of July,’ 1776, declared

themselves free, sovereign, and independent.

CHAPTER XLVIII.
Revolutionary Government oitl1eUnited States

IN the war of the Revolution, thirteen colonies

united. Let us look. at the means by which that
union was sustained during a period of eight years,
and in a severe and trying conﬂict: or, in other
words, let us see what was that government under

which the colonies carried on the revolutionary

struggle to a successful issue.
In 1774, Massachusetts recommended the assem-
bling of a continental Congress at Philadelphia, to

consist of delegates from all the colonies, to deliba

erate upon the common good, and to devise suitable
plans of operation for the exigencyof the times.’

Delegates were accordingly chosen in the va-
rious colonies, some by the legislatures and some
by conventions of the people; i These delegates met
at Philadelphia on the 20th September, 1774, and,
constituting the first great national Congress, fur»
nished an example which afterwards resulted in our
federal government.   _

 Th—i.s body proceeded to adopt certain rules, one
of the most important of which was, thateach
colony should have but one vote, and this rule was
observed throughout the revolution. The delegates
adopted such measures as they deemed necessary,
and recommended another Qongress. This assem-
bled ‘ in May, 17 '7 5, and resolving. upon war,
adopted the famous Declaration of Independenceii‘
on the 4th of July, 1776. This declaration was

unanimously accepted by the American people,

*‘ See this admirable document, in the Appendix of this work.

UNITED STATES REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT. 169

and thenceforward, separation from the government
of Great Britain, and national independence, were

the open and avowed objects of the revolutionary

struggle. To carryout this plan, Congress recom-
mended it to the several colonies to organize state
governments, which was accordingly done, ; and
from this time the delegates to Congress were ap-
pointed by the state legislatures.   E _
The continental Congress, thus organized by a
voluntary union ‘of the states, and delegates being
successively appointed from time to time, continued
to be the government of the nation until near the
close of the war, when certain articles of confedera-
tion were adopted. During this period, they as-
sumed and exercised all ‘necessary powers, acting
indeed without limit or restraint. There was then
no constitution to deﬁne their powers. They made
war and peace; raised armies and equipped navies;
formed treaties and alliances; contracted debts, and
exercised all the high functions of government.
  It mustbe admitted that this Congress therefore
possessed and exercised an arbitrary and despotic
power; but it must be considered, that it was a
revolutionary government, entrusted with the man-

agement of affairs during an emergency; and

farther,- that the acts of this government were sus-
tained by the people.

It was obvious, however, that this arrangement
was only temporary, for as soon as one of the
states should withdraw, the union would be dis-
solved. After providing for the exigencies of the
war, Congress, therefore, directed their attention to
the formation of a system, which should give per-
manency to a union of the states.

CHAPTER XLIX.[
The Confederation.

AFTER ‘various A discussions, Congress ﬁnally
agreed, in Nov. 1777, upon certain A7-Zicles of 0072-
federaz‘/io7z, which were sent to the states for their
consideration. Various delays, and objections

arose, and it was not till l‘/larch, 1781, that Mary»

land, the last state, gave her assent. ,
Scarcely had these articles of confederation been
adopted, before the defects of the system were dis-
covered. Among the ‘most formidable was this,
that’ while Congress had power _to adopt various

‘ measures, it had no eﬁQ6Ct11Ell'I1]8a1”1S of carrying

them into effect. .     a b
An eminent statesman thus expressed himself
on” this subject : “Congress may make and ‘ con-

clude treaties, but can only recommend_the observ-.

ance. of them; they may appoint ambassadors, but
they cannot defray their expenses. They may bor-
row money, but they cannot pay a dollar. They
may coin money, but they cannot import an ounce
of bullion. They may make war, and determine
what number of troops are necessary, but they can-
not raise a single soldier. In .9/tom‘, z‘/my may de-
clare everythiveg, but‘ can do nothing.” C
Thus it seems that Congress had no power to
compel the states to an observance of their acts.
The states might,‘ obey or disobey, as they pleased;
and, in point of fact, many of the acts of i Congress
under the confederation, were totally unobserved.
Nor had Congress any power to punish individ-
uals for any breach of their laws; nor could they

THE CONSTITUTION. A 171

lay taxes, nor collect revenue; nor could they reg-
ulate commerce; and, consequently, the most op-
posite systems of trade with foreign countries
existed in the different states.

These and other evils became so apparent, that t
the necessity of change was obvious‘ to all: yet it '

was withgreat difficulty thatthe states could be
induced to adopt the necessary means for an ade-
quate remedy. [See Appendtaz]

CHAPTERSL.

Origin of the Constitution.

IN 1786, the legislature of Virginia recommend»
ed a convention of commissioners from all the
states, to take into consideration the state of trade.
In ‘compliance with this suggestion, commissioners
from ﬁve states met at Annapolis, in Maryland,
in September, 1784. :I‘hese adopted a report, re-
commending it to Congress to call a convention
of delegates from all the states, at Philadelphia,
inMay, 1787’. I '

Congress adopted this recommendation, and a con-
vention Was held accordingly, all the states, except
Rhode Island, sending delegates to this body. On
the 17th September, 1787, the present Constitution
of the United States was adopted and sent forth to
the people for their consideration. It was ratiﬁed
by all the statesexcept North Carolina and Rhode
Island, and went into operation in 1789.

North Carolina adopted the Constitution in 1789,-
and Rhode Island in 1790. Thus all the thirteen

states became parties to the Union: and the other

thirteen have since voluntarily come into the com—‘

pact. it now becomes a matter of interest and
duty, with every American citizen, to study this
instrument carefully, that he may fully and clearly
understand that national government, to which he
looks for the security of many of his dearest rights.

CHAPTER L1,
Preliminary Remarks on the Constitution.

BEFORE we proceed further, it may be well to t

apprize the young reader of the complicated nature
of our government. In Great Britain, France, 660.,
the system is simple, and easily understood. The
laws of the British Parliament operate over the
whole of England, Ireland and Scotland, and there
is no interfering power to check or limit their
force. The laws of the Frenchlegislature, in like
manner, operate over the whole of France.

But here we have twenty-six states, each being
a separate and complete republic, with all the
machinery of government Within itself. The Con-
stitution of the United States is therefore only a
contract or agreement between these states, in which
it is stipulated that they all give up to the national
government certain rights and powers, as set forth
in that instrument. All rights and powers not
expressly granted to the national government, are
reserved to the states. l

The chief powers granted to the national gov-
ernment, are the making of war and peace; regu-
lating commerce; coining moneys; establishing
post-offices ; imposing taxes, and laying duties

THE CONSTI'I‘UTION.- » 173

upon foreign merchandise; borrowing money on
the credit of the United States, &c. These powers
being granted to Congress, the states cannot eXer~
cise them.  

The Const-itution,”“ with Explanatory Remarks.
33’ In this Chapter, the Constitution is printed in Italic.
PREAMBLE.

We,.tlze ‘people of tbe United States, in order to form C

a more perfect union, establisb justice, ensure domestic
tranquillity, provide for tile commonrdejience, promote the
general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to our-
selves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this
Constitution of the United States cy” America.

Theﬁrst object of the Constitution, as set forth
in the preamble, is “ to form a more perfect union.“

The necessity of a union of the states, more perfect

than had before existed, had been taught by expo-
rience. How could separate states protect them»
selves froin the aggressions of foreign foes? How
could small states sustain themselves against large

ones--as Rhode Island against New York?» For

these and many other considerations, a more per-—
fect union was necessary; and as this is obtained
by the Constitution, we ought to Ch6I‘1Sh it as one of
the most essential blessings of our socialcondition.

* It h.as been objected to the Constitution that it was not pre-
ceded by a “Bill of Rights,” as is the fact with most of the state
constitutions. The Declaration of Independence, and the Decla~

ration of Rights by Congress in 1794, may be regarded as setting
forth the great principles of liberty, susto.ined'in the Constitution.

(See Appendix.)
15*

174 THE CONSTITUTION.

The second object is to “ es’z‘a.bZz's/3 justice.” To
establish justice, is indeed the great object of all
good government. Withoiit justice there can be
no true freedom, ncsecure enjoyment of our rights.
But how can the Constitution of the United States
aid in the establishment of justice? a Do not the
state courts secure this? Not in all cases. Foreign-
ers could not be secure of justice in the individual
states; nor could the citizens of one ‘state be secure
in another. Experience hadtaught this, and there-
fore it became a leading object, in the formation
of the Constitution, to establish justice on a broad
and liberal basis, sothat all who came within the
scope of our government might find shelter and

"protection. a

The next object is “ to ensure domestic tran-
quillity ;” that is, to ensure the states against the
intrigues of foreign nations, against domestic
jealousy and commercial rivalry; against disputes
and dissensions of all kinds; against factionsand
insurrections. These are objects of the highest
consideration, and the necessity of providing some
means of averting such evils, had been shown by
the bitter lessons of history. ‘ i T

The next object is “ to provide for the common
defence.” It has been often remarked, that to
ensure peace we must be prepared for War. It
was therefore indispensable that the general gov-
ernment should have power to levyarmies, sus-
tain a navy, erect fortiﬁcations, &c. How could
these things be done, except by placing them in the
charge of the national government? The separate
states could not carry on War against foreign
nations, for any one would be borne down in
the contest. The only effectual mode of pro-

THE CONSTITUTION. T 17 5

viding for the common defence, was to give up the
vhole matter to the management of the national
government. , ' v   I ~

The next object is “ a‘o_p7‘0m0z‘e the general wel-
fare.” It might be thought that the separate
state governments could do this; but they have in
fact neither the means nor the power. They
have not the resources; for they cannot conve-
niently raise the money to carry on War, to sup»
port navies, to sustain fortiﬁcations and garrisons.
Nor have the separate states the means of en-
forcing upon each other that‘ harmony of action,
which is indispensable, in order to promote the
general welfare. A particular state must look
after the particular interests of its people: it is only
by a general government that the general Welfare
can beesecured. 7 * ’_ .
e The last object of the Constitution, as set forth
in the preamble is, y“ to secure z‘/te blessings of lib-
erty to us. and our posz‘erz'z‘:z/.” In another part of
this work I have endeavored to setforth the nature
of liberty, and the necessity of it to the enjoy-
ment of life.‘ To obtain its blessings, was the
great‘ object of the war of the revolution; to per-
petuate its blessings, is the great design of the Con-
stitution; to diffuse its blessings, should be/the
desire of every American citizen.

We should, however, always bear in mind What
is meant by liberty—"_--civil liberty»-that liberty
which is compatible with law.» True lihertydoes
not i give us perfect freedom; it only allows" us
todo, to think, to feel, as weplease, so far, and

so far only, as we do not injure others. Wecan

best show our love of liberty, by observing ‘the
laws, sustaining good government, and doing Jus-

the wounded, or the miserable; in religion they

are superstitious, and inclined to idolatry.

In the savagestate, the women are generally
slaves, and are compelled to do the common labor
of the household, to carry burthens, to toil in the
ﬁeld, and to do all the ordinarydrudgery of life.
The men are usually addicted to war, hunting, and
rude amusements. L  

The lands are generally held in ‘common.
Among us, all property belongs to some individual,
who alone has a right to it; but among savages,
each person may cultivate any unoccupied spot he
pleases; he may hunt where he pleases, and he
may build a Wigwam where he pleases. 7

Among us, all property belongs to some indi-
vidual, who alone has a right to it. Thus, each
man’s house is hisown, and no one can lawfully
disturb him in the possession of it. It is the same
with his land, furniture, money, and merchandise.
With our western Indians, the property of each
individual of the tribe is partially secured, but
with many savages it is otherwise. In New
Guinea, an individual may perhaps claim the bow
and arrow he has made, or the Wigwam he has
‘built; but these are by no means secure from a

stronger man, who may be disposed to take them

away; and‘ indeed it is usual among these tribes
for any one to take whatever hedesires for his
use, provided another is not actually in the pos-
session of it. 1 _ _
Among savages, there are no written or
printed laws. The people have certain customs,
and if disputes arise, they are settled according to
these.- All communities have some government.
Our Arnerican Indians are usually governed by

tice to our fellow-men. Justice is liberty; injus-
tice is tyranny.

The Constitution consists of seven articles, and
thirteen amendments. The first article relates to
Congress, to which it assigns all Legislative power :
the second relates to the President, and vests in
him the Eaecittive power: the third relates to
the Judiciary, and vests in this the Judicial power.
It will therefore be perceived, that here is a distri-
bution of the several powers of government, as I
have before stated. a ‘

ARTICLE 1.

SEC. I.—-——All legislative powers herein granted, shall
be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall

«consist of a Senate and House ofRepresentatives.

Here it will be seen that the legislative power is A

wholly vested in Congress, which is to consist of a
Senate and House of Representatives.    

SEC. II.——1. The House of Representatives shall be com-
posed of members chosen every second year, by the people
of the several states; and the electors in each state shall
have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most
numerous branch of the state legislatztre. »

We here notice that the representatives are to
be chosen by the people, the object being to obtain
such persons as will represent, or express, the
views and Wishes of the people. Here lies the
great principle of our liberty. Invoting for our
representatives, We express our wishes as to the
measures we desire to see adopted by the national
legislature.

' 2. No person shall be a representative who shall not
have attained the age of twentg,/-_/ive years, and been seven

THE CONSTITUTION. 177'

years a citizen of the United States, and who shall not,

when elected, be an inhabitant of the state in which he-

shall be chosen. ‘ S
This refers to the qualiﬁcations of a representa-

ytive. He must be tWenty—ﬁve years old, so as to

ensure maturity of mind and a degree of expe-

, rience; he must be a citizen of the United States,

for We could not trust foreigners to make our laws;
and he must live in the state he is to represent,

‘else how can he know the interests, Wants, and

Wishes of thelpeople Cl

3. Representatives and direct taxes shall be appor-
tioned among the several states which may be included
within this Union, according totheir respective numbers,
which shall be determined by adding to the whole num-
ber of free persons, including those bound to service for a
term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-
ﬁfths of all other persons. The actual enumeration
shall be made. within three years after the first meeting
of the Congress of the United States, and within every
subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they
shall by law direct. The number of representatives shall
not exceed one for every thirty thousand, but each state
shall have at least one representative: and until such
enumeration shall be made, the state of New Hampshire
shall be entitled to choose three; Massachusetts," eight;
Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, one; Con-
necticut, five ; New York, six; New Jersey, four ;
Pennsylvania, eight; Delaware, one; Maryland, six ,-

Virginia, ten; North Carolina, five; South Carolina, H

five ; and Georgia, three.

This lays down a principle, by which We may
decide how many representatives a state’ shall
have; and when direct taxes are laid, how imuch
each state shall pay. Its provides lfor taking ‘a

2

1'78 THE CONSTITUTION.

census every two years, and when the population

- -of each state is thus ascertained, Congress is to say
" how the representatives shall be apportioned.

In 1842, a distribution act was passed, declaring
that every state should have one representative for
every seventy thousand six hundred and eighty in-
habitants; and that in each case, where, after
dividing the inhabitants by this number, a fraction

‘oflover one half of the seventy thousand six hun-
~ dred’ and eighty remained, one representative should

be allowed for that fraction. : Accordingly, the fol-

lowing is the number of representatives, to, which
the several states are entitled:  

Maine 7 South Carolina‘ '7
New Hampshire 4 Georgia 8
Massachusetts 10 Alabama 7' -
Rhode Island 2 Louisiana 4
Connecticut A 4 Mississippi 4
Vermont 4 Tennessee ‘ 11
New York 34 Kentucky ‘ 10,
New Jersey 5 ’ Ohio i 21
Pennsylvania 28 Indiana 10
Delaware   1 Illinois ’ 7
Maryland ' 6 Missouri 5
Virginia 15 Arkansas   1
  North Carolina 4 9 Michigan 3

It will be observed that, in the preceding section,

persons “bound to service for a term of years,”  

are spoken of: by which is meant apprentices, and
other persons, chieﬂy foreigners, who had bound
themselves to service for a series of years, generally
with a view to pay their passage. ,

We observe, also, in this section, the phrase “ all
other persons.” By these are meant slaves; and

THE CONSTITUTION. A V 1'79

it will be perceived, therefore, that three fifths of
the slaves of the southern states, although they
do not vote, and are held as property, are still
counted as forming a basis of representation in
Congress. g t .

Thus, by the late census, South Carolina, has
two hundred and siXty~seven thousand three ‘hun-
dred and sixty free inhabitants, and three hundred
and twenty-seven thousand and thirty-eight slaves.
In fixing the apportionment of representatives,
three ﬁfths of these slaves, one hundred and ninty-»
six thousand two hundred and twenty-three, are
added to the whole population, making fourhun-
dred and sixty-three thousand ﬁve hundred and
eighty-th1"ee:————this is divided by seventy thousand
six hundred and eighty, and accordingly South
Carolina would beentitled to six representatives;
but as there is a fraction of thirty-ninethousand
ﬁve hundred and three, she is entitled to another,
making seven representatives.

4. When vacancies happen in the representation from

any state, the executive authority thereof shall issue writs

of electio_n to ﬁll such vacancies. .

« 5. The House of Representatives shall choose their
speaker and other oﬂicers, and shall have the solepower
of impeachment. r

By the power of impeachment here is meant

the right to make a written accusation against the.

president, or any other high oﬁicer of government,
for the purpose of bringing him to trial. This
trial must take place before the Senate of the
United States. i _

An instance of impeachment took place in 1805.,

against Samuel Chase, one of the judges of the’

180 THE CONSTITUTION

Supreme Court of the United States, for misde-
meanor, in the trial of John Fries for treason.
He was, however, acquitted.

SEC. III.-T--1. The Senate of the United States shall
he composed of two senators from each state, chosen by

_ the legislature thereof, for six years; and each senator
shall have one vote.

Here weobserve, that senators are chosen, not
by the people, but by the legislatures of the states;
they are not chosen for two years, but for six;
they are not apportioned according to population;

but each state has two. A

It may be asked why two houses are needed in
the legislature, and the answer is this: that one

‘ house might be careless or hasty; they might

combine together for some bad object, and pass
bad laws. By dividing the legislature into two
bodies, and making it necessary that every law shall
be adopted by a majority of each, one becomes a
check. upon the other. In this way, we are more
secure of obtaining cool, careful and patriotic legis—
lation. ,

It will be seen that the i members of the Senate
being electedefor six years,“ and the representatives
for but two, the former is the more stable and per»
manent body, while the latter is thetmore perfect
expression of the will of the people.

2. Immediately afterthey shall be assembled, in conse-
quence of the ﬁrst election, they shall be divided, as
equally as may he, into three classes. The seats of the-
senators of the ﬁrst class shall, be vacated at the expiration
of the second year; of the second class, at the expiration
of the fourth year; and of the third class, at the expira-

tion of the_sixth year_;_ so that one-third may he chosen,

THE * CONSTITUTION. 181

every second year; and  vacancieshappen, by resig-t

nation or otherwise, during the recess of the legislature
of any state, the executive t thereof may make temporary
appointments until the next meeting of the legislature,
which shall then ﬁll such vacancies. , I

It will be remarked that provision is here made
for gradually changing the whole body of the
Senate. Thus, while a large portion are retained,
for several years, so as to have many experienced
persons among them, they may be entirely changed
every six years, so as to prevent their combining
together for any sinister purposes. ,

3. No person shall be a senator who shall not have
attained to the age-of thirty years, and been nine years
a ‘citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when
elected, be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall
bechosen. r t

4. The vice-president of the 1 United States shall be
president of the senate, but shall have no vote, unless they
be equally divided.

5. The Senate shall choose their other oﬁcers, and also
rt president pro tempore, in the absence of the vice-presi-
dent, or whenthe shall exercise the oﬁce of president of
the United States;

6. The Senate shall have the sole power to try all im-
peachments. ‘When sitting for that purpose, they shall

be on oath or aﬁrmation. When the president of the.

United States is tried the chief justice shall preside ; and

no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of

two-thirds of the members present."

7. Judgment, in cases of impeachment, shall not extend
farther than to removal from oﬂice, and disqualiﬁcation
to hold and enjoy -any oﬁice of honor, trust, or profit,
-under the United States ; but the party convicted ‘ shall,
nevertheless, be liable and subject to indictment,’ trial,
judgment, and punishmentaccording to law.

182 THE ‘CONSTITUTION.

SECT. IV.—1.. The times, places, and manner of holdv
ing elections for senators and representatives, shall be
prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but
the Congress m.ay at any time by law make or alter
such regulations, except as to the places of choosing
senators. , _ A

2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every
year; and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in
December, unless they shall by law appoint a diﬁerent
day. ~ ~ ‘

SECT. V.——1. Each house shall be judge of the elecsr
tions, returns, and qualiﬁcations of its own members;
and a majority of each shall‘ constitute a quorum to do
business; but a smaller number may adjourn from day
to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance
of absent members, in such manner,’ and under such-
penalties, as each house may provide.  ' .

2.. Each house may determine the rules of its proceed
ings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and,
with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.

3. Each house shall heep a journal of its proceedings,
and-‘from time to time publish the same, exceptinglsuch
parts as may, in their ' judgment, require -secrecy; and
the yeas and nays of the members of either house, on any
question, shall, at the desire of one—ﬁfth of those present,
be entered on the journal. T

4. Neither house, during the session of Congress, shall,
without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than
three days, nor to any other place than that in which the
two houses shall be sitting. ‘

‘SECT. VI.—1. The senators and representatives -shall
receive a compensation for their services, to be ascer-
tained bylaw, and paid out of the treasury of the United

States. They shall, in all cases, except treason, felony,-

and breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest, during
their attendance ‘at the session of their respective houses,
and in going to and returning from the same ; and for

THE CONSTITUTION. 183

any speech or debate in either house, they shall not be
questioned in any other place. _

The importance of having a member of Congress
free from arrest, during the session, is obvious; for
if he could be arrested, he might be kept away,

when his single vote would decide. the most moment, _
ous questions. It is important, too, that members  

should be permitted to speak freely, Withoutlfear
of consequences, else they might be overawed,
and truths, essential to the public“welfa're, might
be suppressed. r   p

2. No senator or representative shall, _during the time
for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil oﬂice
under the authority-of the United States, which shall
have been created, or the emoluments whereof shall have
been increased," during such time; and no person hold-
ing any oﬂlce under the United States, shall be a member
of either house during his continuance in oﬂice.

The propriety of these restrictions is obvious;

for if a senator or representative could hold an

oﬂice under the general government, they might

thus be effectually bribed by the Executive: and
if they could be appointed to offices created, or the
emoluments of which were increased during their
term, they might legislate with a corrupt view to
the obtaining of such places for themselves.

SEC. VII.—1. All bills for raising revenue shall orig-
inate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate
may propose or concur with amendments, as on other
bills. . I

As the people pay the taxes, it is a Wise and just
provision that all bills which are designed to-raise
money from the people, for the support of govern-
ment, should originate with the popular branch of

184 ‘THE CONSTITUTION.

the legislative body, and which is understood,
more particularly, to represent the people. ’

2. Every bill, which shall have passed the House of
Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a
law, be presentedto the president of the United States: «
he approves, he shall sign it ; but if not, he shall return
it with his objections to that house in which it shall have
originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their
journal, and proceed to reconsiderit.  after such re»
consideration, two-thirds of that house shall agree to
pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections,
to the other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsid—_
ered ; and  approved by two-thirds of that house, it shall
become a law. But in all such cases, the votes of both
houses shall be determined by yeas and nays ; and the
names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall
be entered on the journal of each house respectively. ‘ If
any bill shall not be returned by the president within ten’

This passage gives the president the powerto
stop the passage of any bill passed by both houses,
by sending it back to the house in which it origin,»
ated, with his objections. This is called a veto,
which is a Latin Word signifying I prohibit. The
king of England has a Veto power, but it has not
been resorted to in modern times. The king of ,
France had also a Veto power, but when he used
it, during the revolution, itcreated a resentment
which hurled him from the throne. The veto be-
longs to several European governments

This power has beenfrequently used of late, by
the presidents of the United States. If a president
Vetoes a bill, it still becomes a law, if; two thirds
of t bothrhouses of Congress Vote for it, after its
return. A bill becomes a law without the signs.»

THE CONSCTITUTION. 187

This important paragraph ‘prescribes the powers
of Congress. In the first place it authorizes them
to “ lay and collect taxes, duties, impost.s',‘and exci-l
.s~es.” Taxes are laid upon property, as houses,
lands, income, &c. Duties or imposts are levied
upon foreign goods, i.mported into thecountry. To
secure and collect these, custom houses are estab-
lished, where vessels are obliged to be entered, and
where a careful examination of the goods takes
place, so as to see that the duties areproperly laid
and levied. ”

The chief revenue of the government of the
United States is derived from duties laid on foreign
goods: there has been a resort to direct taxation,
only during war, or in anticipation of it. The
separate states generally derive their revenues from
direct taxes on houses,‘ lands, money, stocks, and
sometimes upon a man’s income. a

As thegovernment needs money for its support,
it isthe duty of every one cheerfullyto pay his
taxes, provided they are properlyiassessed ; but as
taxes are a burthen upon the labor of a country,
a wise people willendeavor always to see that
they’are as light as possible, whether levied in
the shape of direct taxes or duties upon imported
goods.

Congress may “ regulate com/znerce with foreign
nations, and among the several states, and with the
Indian tribes.” These few words convey a vast
trust. It takes from the several states, the power of
regulating trade and commercial intercourse, and
gives it up wholly to Congress. .

It. gives to Congress the control of trade and
navigation with the states—-—such as the coasting
trade and ﬁsheries; the government of seamen

188 r THE CONSTITUTION.

on board v American ships; the enacting of pilot-
laws, quarantine laws, and laws respecting wrecks
at sea, éec. It «gives the power of laying embar-
goes, building light-houses, placing of buoys and
beacons; removal: of obstructions in rivers and
bays, &c. . , r      

The other powers conferred on Congress are
so clearly stated as hardly to need exposition. It
may be well, however, to saythat the power “ to
8:Z'6’i"CiS6 exclusive legislation over such district (not
exeeeding ten miles square) as may become the seat
of government of the United States,’»’ has relation to
the District of Columbia. When‘i'the Constitution"
first went into operation, New York, and after-

wards Philadelphia, wasthe seat of the general

government.

But it "appears that when the Constitution was

adopted, it was had in contemplation to remove to
some other district; and therefore this provisional

article was introduced. The District Sf Columbia,’

lwhi’ch,is now under the government of Congress,
(Washirigton having become the seat of government
in 1800,) is ten miles square, and was ceded to the

United States by Virginia and Maryland, to which

it belonged.

Seer. IX.--1. The migration or importation of such
persons as any of the states now existing slzall tlzinlx:
proper to admit; s/call not be prolzi6ited_ by the Congress
prior to tire year one tlaonsand eiglzt hundred and eiglzt;
but a tax or duty may be imposed on suelz importation, not
exceeding ten dollars for eaclz person. ~ i

As the “power of regulating commerce,” given
to Congress, was understood toenable that body to
prohibit the foreign slave trade, this article was in-

THE CONSTITUTION.   189

troduced to prevent such an act, before the year
1808. ,As soon "as this restriction was at an end,
Congress proceeded to abolish the foreign slave
trade, thus affording the first example of its inter~
diction in modern times. t  
2. The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not
be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion tar z’7wa~
sion, the public safety may require 2'2‘. l 2
‘ “Habeas corpus” is a kind of writ, known to

the common law, and is used when a person is im-

prisoned, to ascertain whether the imprisonment is
lawful or not. In despotic and ill—-governed coun-
tries, it‘ often happens that a‘ person is taken up and
put in prison, where he may lie for months or years
without a trial, and as the case may be, without
any suﬂicient cause. This writ of “ habeas corpus”
enables the person; imprisoned to have the body‘(ha-
beds corpus, meaning, have the body) brought before
the judge, and if the cause is insufficient, he is set
at liberty. This writof habeas corpus is therefore
a great safeguard to personal liberty, and its preser-
vation is a matter of the greatest importance. ’

3. No bill of attainder, or ex pést facto law, shall be
passed. V F A l x

A “bill of az‘taz'nder” is an act passed by the
legislature, convicting a person of some crime, and
inflicting the punishment of death, without trial.
It is a power in which the greatest tyranny has been
exercised in foreign countries, and its prohibition
is, therefore, in the highest degree, proper.

An “ex post facto” law is one which is passed
after the act is done; it is a law which operates

upon the past, and generally applies to public»
offences. If Congress could pass an eccspost facto

190 THE CONSTITUTION.

law, they could make any acts criminal which
have heretofore been lawful, and thus inﬂict the
greatest cruelty and injustice.

4. No capitation, -or other direct tax shall be laid,
unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein
before directed to beta/sen.

5. No tax or duty shall‘ be laid on articles e;z;por'ted i

from any state. No preference shall be given by any
regulation of commerce or revenue, to the ports of one
state ‘over those of another ; nor shall vessels bound to or
from one state be obliged to enter, clear,or.. payduties
in another.   T

6. No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in
consequence of approp.riations made by law ; and a regu-
lar statement and account of the receipts and ‘expendi-
tures -of all public money shall be published from ‘time’ to
time. ‘ A

These restrictions upon the disbursement of pub-
lic moneys, and regulations respecting the public.
accounts, are indispensable, in order to prevent the

misapplication of funds, and to make all public ,of- ‘

ﬁcers feel that their cond_uct, in these matters, must
undergo a careful scrutiny. If it were not for this
first provision, the president of the United States

i would have no check upon the expenditures of
public money. This stipulation renders him, in

respect to money, dependent upon the people’s
representatives.

'7. No title of nobility shall be granted by the United
States ,j and no person holding any oﬁce of proﬁt or trust
under them, shall, without the consent of Congress, ac-
cept of any present, emolument, oﬂice or title, of any kind
whatever, from any Icing, prince, or foreignstate.

This passage prohibits titles of nobility, which

lay a foundation for unequal ranks and privi-

THE CONSTITUTION. 191

leges; and prohibits public officers from receiving

presents from foreign powers, by which means, as
history *teaches us, so many persons have been
bribed to betray their country. ’

Seer.  No state shall enter into any treaty, alli-
ance, or confederation ; grant letters of marque and re-
prisal ; coin money, emit bills of credit; malre anything
but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts;
pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law im-
pairing the obligation of contracts; or grant any title

. of nobility.

2. No state shall, without the consent of Congress, lay

' any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what

may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection
laws; and the net produce of all duties and imposts laid
by any state on imports or exports, shall be for the use of
the treasury of the United States; and all such laws shall
be subject to the revision and control of the Congress.
No state shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any
duty on tonnage, lteep troops. or ships of war in time of

. peace, enter into any agreement or compact with another

State, or with a foreign power, or engage Iintwar, unless
actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not
admit of delay.

This important section lays various restrictions

‘upon the states. The “bills of credit” referred to

were a well known denomination of paper money,
issued by the colonies before the revolution, and at
a later period by the states. As there were no suf-
ficient, funds to meet them, they depreciated, so that
sometimes a thousand dollars in paper passed for

one of ‘silver. The evils that ﬂowed from this '

source were of the most aggravated kind; and
therefore we see the Wisdom of providing against
this fruitful cause of mischief.

I92 THE CONSTITUTION.

ARTICLE II.

Vile shall see that this article relates to the
Executive branch of the ‘government.

SECT. I.--1. The executive power shall be vested in a

President of the United States of America. He ‘shall

er with the Vice-President, chosen for the same term, be
elected as follows: _

2. ‘Each state shall appoint, in such -a mannerkas the
legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal
to the whole number of senators and representatives to
which thestate may be entitled in the Congress; but no
senator or representative, or person, holding an oﬂice of
trust or proﬁt under the United States, shall be ap-
pointed an elector. s

[A paifagraphi is here cancelled, Article XII. of

4. The Congress may determine the time of choosing
the electors, and the day on which they shall give their
votes; which day shall be the same throughout the United
States. i ‘

5. No person except a natural born citizen, or. a citi-
zen; of the United States at the timeof the adoption of
this Constitution, shall be eligible to the oﬁce, of presi-
dent; neither shall any person be eligible to that oﬁice
who ‘shall not have attained to the age of thirty-ﬁve years,
and been fourteen years a resident‘ within the United
States.

6. In case of the removal of the President from oﬂice,
or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the
powers and duties of the said ojice, the same shall devolve
on the Vice-President; and the Congress may by law
provide for the case of removal, death, resignation, orin.~
ability, both of the President and Vice-President, declar~

then Vice-President, succeeded to the ofﬁce of Pre-
sident, assuming all the powers and functions of the
station, as if he had been directly.’ elected President.

7. The President shall, at stated times, receive for his
services a compensation which shall neither be increased’
nor‘ diminished during the period for which he shall have
been elected; and he shall not receive, within that period,
anyother emolument from the United States, or any of
them. . .

.8. Before he enter on the execution of his oﬁice, he shall
take the following oath or aﬁirmation :

9. ‘,‘I do solemnly swear [or aﬁirm] that I will faith-
fully execute the oﬁice of President of the United States,

b kind will, to the best of my ‘ability, preserve, protect, and

defendthe. Constitution of the S United States.”

The salary of p the president is ﬁxed at twenty-
ﬁve thousand dollars a year, as before stated.

SI-ICT. II.——1. The President shall be commander-in~
chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of
the militia of the several states, when -called into the-acs
tual service of the United States ; he may require the opin;-«

ion‘ in writing of the principal oﬁcer in each. of the.
eareczttive departments, upon any subject relating to- the
 duties of their respective oﬁices; and he shall have power

to grant reprieves and pardons for oﬂences against the
United States, except in cases of impeachment. ,

inate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Sen-
ate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers,_and
consuls, judges of the supreme court,» and all other oﬁicers
of the United States, whose appointments are not herein
otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by
law. But the Congress may by law vest the appointment

‘ of such inferior oﬂicers as they think proper in the presi-

dent alone, in the courts of law, or, in the heads of de-
partments. . '

3. The President shall have power to fill up all vacan-=

cies that may happen during the recess of the‘Senate, by

granting commissions which shall expire at the endiof

their next session. ’ . _

The power of appointirrgor nominating to office,
isone ofthe greatest‘ mea'ns”of inﬂuence possess-
ed by the executive. The number of persons in
the «employ of the general governrnent is many
thousands: it is said’ there are nearly ten thousand
postmaseters, alone. It is obvious that the individ-

  ual who has in his control so many places of 1 trust

and emoluinent, has a patronage which he may

exertto his own political advantage, if he so chooses.

It must be considered, however, that there is
always a tide of 'opposition , created by those out of
oﬂice, against ‘those who are in ,' ‘s°o that it seems
necessary that an administration should possess
some means of resisting this outward force. The
patronage of the government is therefore perhaps
no .more than a necessary and proper power, by

.which the government resists the shock of opposi-
tion. It is only when corruptly used that it is to

be feared.

other public ministers; heshall take care that the laws
be faithfully executed ; and shall commission all the o]7i-
cers of the United States- ' "

When Congress come together, the president
sends them a message, in compliance with this
section, setting ‘forth his Views of public affairs:
and from time to time, he sends them’ special mes-
sages, relating to such topics as he deems worthy
of special attention. ‘ c

SECT. ‘IV.—-1. The President, Vice-President, and all
civil ojicers of the United States, shall «be removed from

Among such a people, there is noienlightenedi

By “original jurisdiction,” it is meant that the

meant that cases begun in the state courts maybe

Two important points are here secured; the
“trial by jury” in criminal cases; and a trial in
the state where the crime is said to be cormnitteol.

We have already spoken of the trial by jury, as
originating in England, and being one of the riglits

"Seer. IIl.—1. Treason against the United States shall
-consist only in levying zvaragainst them, or in adhering
‘to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. ‘ No per-
son shall be convicted of treason, unless on the testimony
of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in
open court. _ ' ” ,

. 2. The Congress shall have power to declare the pun-
ishment of treason ; that no attainder of treason shall

work corruption of blood, or forfeiture, except during the a

life of the person attainted.

In England, treason is deﬁned to be any overt
act which has for its tendency or object the death
of the king. Levying war against the king; Wri-
tings. which import his death; rebellion; inciting
foreigners to invade the kingdom 2; openly adhering
to the king’s enemies, are all acts of treason.

The Constitution deﬁnes acts of treason against
the United States, “to consist in levying War

against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giv-

ing them aid and comfort.” Treason is gener-
ally deemed the highest crime against civil society,
and its aim ‘being to overthrow the government, it
is apt to excite the ﬁercestresentment of thecom-
%mun"ity. History furnishes’ abundant evidence of
this, ‘especially in England, where the existing law
in respect to this "crime, still punishes the offender
hy drawing him on a hurdle to the place of ‘execu-
tion: he is then hanged, his head cut off, and his
body divided into four quarters. The king, how-»
ever, may dispense with these savage accessories
to the execution. r

So many persons have, in former times, been ar-
rested and executed on ‘vague charges of treason,

that it became important to deﬁne it very carefully,

and to require adequate evidence of the fact. If it

were not clearly defined, or if a precise testimony
Were notprequired, it would be easyfor judges,
under the inﬂuence of the government, or incited
by corrupt and selﬁsh‘ motives, to make treason of

inferior crimes, and thenatural jealousy of the‘

community‘ might bear them out. Congress, hav—
ing the power to fix the punishment of treason,
have enacted- that itshall be by hanging,’ Without

the horrid accompaniments adopted in other coun- 1

tries.
The clause may need explanation, ‘which, says
“ but no az‘taz'nde7' of treason, shall worlc corruption

ofblood, or fo7'feiz‘m"e, ervcept during the lvgfe of the '

person atz‘aim‘ed."’ Attainder, in its original feudal
sense, Was a fiction of the law, taintingand cor-»
rupting the blood, and descending to several gen-
erations, so as to disquia'l-ify them from holding
property. A/person attaintedof treason, that is,

accused and convicted of treason, in England, not

only forfeited his ‘estate, but he was held inc‘a~

pableof having,1<3gal heirs, and his property re—i

'_ As great tyranny and injustice had often been
inﬂicted, by attainders, in England, our wise-
fathers here provided that no attainder or convic-
tion of treason, shouldwork corruption of blood;

gaged in certain schemes for seizing upon New Or- i

He proceeded in the prosecution of his plans,

and hadalready involved various individuals in ‘

them, when he was arrested at and brought to trial
before the Supreme Court of the United States, at
Washington. Thistook place in 1806. The trial
was one of the most interesting that has ever oc-
curred-in the country. i i

It was on this occasion that William Wirt, the
attorney for the United States, made the famous

By virtue of this last passage, our territorial
governments have been established. Those exist-»
ing, at present, are Florida, Iowa, and Wisconsin.
The basis of these territorial governments was laid
in an admirable ordinance, framed by Nathan
Dane, of Beverly, ;Massachusetts, and adopted by
the Continental Congress in1787. i

TH-E CONSTITUTION. 201

  This ordinance has been modiﬁed by Congress
from time to time, to suit theivarying condition of
the territories. Each of them has now a governor;
appointed by the president, and a legislature, con»
sisting of representatives chosen by the people,
who make laws, appoint _mag1strates,&c.  

This legislature appoints one delegate to the
House of Representatives at Washington, Who may
debate questions, but cannot vote.  When a terri-
tory has a population equal to the number requir-
ed by the fapportionment of r.epre.sentativesamong
the states or one representative, it may, on adopt-
ing a republican form of government, be admitted
into the Union, by act of Congress. g

It is thus thatseveral of the states, once having
been under territorial government, have become
members of the AUIIIOII. Ohio was admitted in
1802; Indiana in 1816; Illinois in 1818; Missis-
sippi _in 1817 ; Alabama i.n_1819.; Missouri in 1820;
Michigan in 1836; Louisiana in 1812; Arkansas.
in 81836. All these were once; subyect to territo-
rial government. \

SECT. IV.n-— The United States shall guaranty to every
state‘ in this Union a republican form of government, and
shall protect each of them against invasion‘; and on ap-
plication of the legislature, or of the executive, (when. the
legislature cannot be convened,) against domestic vio-
lence. .

It was by virtue of this section that Rhode
Island, in 1842, called upon the President for aid
in suppressing the “ Dorr Insurrection,” which then
took place.   ,

, ARTICLE v.

The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses
shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this

Constitution; or, on the application of the legislatures of
two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for
proposing amendments; which, in either case, shall be
valid, to all intents and purposes,- as part of this Consti-

tution, when ratiﬁed by thelegislatures of three fourths

of the several states, or by conventions in three fourths
thereof, as the one or the other modeof ratification, may
be proposed by the Congress : provided, that no amendment
which may be made prior to ‘the year one thousand eight
hundred and eight, shall, in any manner, afect the first

and fourth clauses in ‘the ninth section of the first arti-

cle; and that no state, without its consent, shall, be de-
prived of its equal suﬂrage in the Senate.

It is by Virtueof this provision, that several
amendments to the Co11st.itut'1on were adopted soon.
after its acceptance by the people. No amend-
ments have been adopted for many years.

ARTICLE VI.

1. All debts contracted, and engagements entered into,
before the adoption of this Constimtion, shall be as valid
against the United , States, under this Constitution, as
under the confederation. ‘ A « - .

2. This Constitution, and the laws of 4 the United States
which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties
made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the
United States, shall be the supreme law of the land ; and
the judges in every state shall be bound thereby; any-
thing in the Constitution or laws of any state to the con-
trary notwithstanding. V

3. The Senators and Representatives before mentioned,
and the members of the several state legislatures, and all
e:tecuti've and judicial oﬁicers, both of the United» States
and of the several states, shall be bound by oath o5r_a_1‘7’ir-
mation to support this Constitution: but no religious test

. shall ever be required as a qualiﬁcation to any ojﬁce or
.g public trust under the United States.

THE CONSTITUTION. 203’

The provision here that “no religious test shall
ever be required as a qualiﬁcation toany oﬁce,” is
designed to prevent the ascendancyof any religious

sect, in the government, and the persecution of an-

indivi_dual for his religious opinions. In other
countries, -as England, France, &c., it has fre-4

quently happened that persons entertaining certain
religious notions, have been entirely excluded from

all oﬂices of trust and profit. Until a very recent

period, Catholics have been held ineligible to

office in England; but this restriction is now
removed. a

ARTICLE VII.

The ratiﬁcation of the conventions of nine states’ shall
be suﬂicient for the estahlishment of this Constitution be-
tween the states so ratifying the same.

It has beenalready stated that when the Consti-
tution Was presented to the people for their accept~
ance, it was immediately ratiﬁed by all the thirteen

' states, except North Carolina and Rhode Island.

This made eleven states, two more than required
by this provision. , 

Measures were taken in 1788 by Congress, as
soon as it was ascertained that the requisite num-
ber of states had accepted the Constitution, to carry
it into effect. An election was ordered, and Wed-
nesday, the 18th of llVIarch, 1789, was the time
appointed for commencing proceedings under the
Constitution. *

The members of Congress assembled accord-
ingly at New York, then the seat of government,
but a quorum for transacting business did‘ not
arrive till the 6th of April. On counting the votes
for President, it was found that George Washing~

c 204: THE CONSTITUTION.

ton was unanimously elected President, and John

Adams was elected Vice President.
Since that period, the following persons have

held the office of President: ,,
John Adams of Massachusetts, 17197 to 1801.
Thomas Jeffersoii of Virginia, ;1801 to 1809..
James Madison of do. i 1809 to 1817.1 _
James Monroe of do. 1817 to 1825.
John Quincy Adams of Mass. 1825 to 1829. ,

Martin Van Buren of New York, 1837 to 1841.

establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof; or abriclging the freeclom of speech, or of the
press; or the right‘ of zhe people peaceably to assemble and
to petition the govermnent for a redress of grievances;

This is a most important provision: it secures
us against a “union of church and sz‘az‘e,” which
has been one of the great evils of foreign govern-
ments.‘ When government has undertaken to es-
tablish a particular religion, it has patronised only
those who adopted its creed, and it has always per-»
secuted those who differed from it. Thus freedom

AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION. 205

of religious opinion, or religious toleration, is in-
compatible with‘ the union of church and state.

Even in England, where a church is established
and supported by the government, those who do,
not belong to this church, are, however, taxed to
support it. They are therefore compelled to aid
in propagating and promoting a religious faith,
which they believe to be erroneous. It is to p.re~
vent such tyranny, that the clause we are noticing,
is introduced. s »

“Freedom of speech’ ’ and " ‘ freedome f the press,”
are alsoamong the most essential safeguardsof
liberty. If men may speak freely, and if they
may freely publish their opinions, it is likely that
the abuses of government will be exposed, and the

people put on their guard against those who might

plot their ruin. _

Most governments of Europe, have, at various
periods, put restraints upon the freedom of speech,
and the freedom of the press; and even now, there
are few foreign countries in which entire liberty is
enjoyed in these respects. Despotism fears the
truth; it shrinks from discussion; it therefore
dreads freedom of speech and the press. But a
free government, like ours, instituted by the people,
and designed for the beneﬁt of the people, can have
no inducement, r so long as it is administered ac-
cording to its true intent, to hide the truth or inter-«
rupt discussion.

The right of the people, peaceably to assemble, in
order to discuss public topics, and express their
wishes upon public affairs, is a great right, and one
that ought never to be impaired. It is by assem-
bli.j6.S of the people, in masses, that rulers are made

The Civilized State.

 

W:-12:24’ a nation has so far advanced in reﬁne- a

men:  to have a well settled government, which

ensures order ; 'Wh‘lCl'1 has regular tribunals of jus» -

tice, a general knowledge of the arts, a security

civilization implies reﬁnement of manners, a‘kn0.w-
ledge of the useful arts, and a general diﬁ"usi_on, of
lmowledge. ‘ ‘ ”

Among the civilized nations, live may place the
United States, Inost. of the. nations of Europe,

China, and some othe71fs' of the Eassternycontinent.

to feel the people’s power, and are taught the
necessity of regarding their wishes.

The “riglaf of pez‘ition” is essential to liberty.
VVhat more decided mark of humiliating slavery
could be furnished, than a condition which deprives
men of the right of laying their Wants and wishes»,
their prayers and petitions, before their rulersil
Seldom has any king, or despot, denied this right
to his subjects. It is one of the most universal‘ of
human rights, and jwould exist, even if not secured
by this provision of the Constitution. ,

j The right to petition, carries with it an obligation
on thepart of the petitioned, to hear and consider the
prayer. The mere right to pray, without being lis-
tened to, is mockery. As well-mighit a petition be
addressed tothe stones or the trees, as to human
-beings, if there were no obligation to hear andcon-T
sider the prayer. Congress, are therefore bound to
hear and consider every reasonable and respectful
petition which ispresented to them; _

ART. II.———A well regalatecl r72iZz'tz'a being necessary to’

the security of a free state, the ﬁght of the people to keep
and bear arms s/tall not be infringed. , o ‘

In some despotic countries, the people have been
denied the privilege of having guns and other
Weapons in their possession, because the govern-
ment feared the people, and therefore deemed it

A necessary to keep these means of warfare out of
r their hands. ' Our populargovernment can have

no "such fear.

ART. III.—-No soldier s/zalil, in time of peace, be guar-

, tered in any /zoase, wit/tout the consent of Ike owner; nor T‘
in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.

AMENDMENTS TO cmi CONSTITUTION. 207

The g:r1arte1'ing of troops on the people, has been

one  the common acts of tyranny inﬂicted by

monarchical governments.

ART. IV.—-—-The right of the people to be secure in their
persons, houses, papers, and eﬁects, against unreasonable
searches and seizures, shall not be violated; and no,war-
rants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by
oath or aﬁirmation, and particularly describing the place’
to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

This provision is important,for it has frequently
happened, in former times, that a despotic ruler has
sent his officers into a man’s house, and seized his
papers; and these have been used to convict him
of treason or other crimes. In order to the enjoy-
ment of liberty; in order that every man may feel

safe, it is indispensable that barriers against such

actssof tyranny should be established. '
ARr.————V.—-—No person shall be held to answer for a

capital, or’otherwis\e infamous crime, unless on a present-

ment orindictment of a grand jury, except in cases aris-
ing, inthe land or naval forces, ‘or in the militia when in
actual service, in time of war or public danger; nor shall
any person be subject, for the same-oﬁ”enc'e, to be twice put
in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor be deprived of life, lib»

erty, or property, without due process of law ; _ no'r shall

be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against
himself; nor shall private property be taken for public

use, without just compensation.

These provisions are essential, and We cannot
too much commend the wisdom that established

, them; nor ought -we to fail to rejoice that such

safeguards to our liberty are provided. In reading
the history of other countries, We shall see how’
much humanity has suffered for the Want of such

208 AMENDMENTS TO. THE CONS'I‘I’1‘UTION.

 provisions; and we shall have renewed occasion to

love and cherish that Constitution which affords
the Weak, as well as the strong, such protection
against the encroachments of power.

ART. Vl.—-—In all criminal prosecutions, t/ie accused
s/zall enjoy t/ie riglit to a speedy and public trial, by an
-impartial juryof the state and district w/ierein the crime

previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the
nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with
the witnesses against ltirn ; to liarve compulsory process for
obtaining witnesses in his favor; and toliave the assist-
ance of counsel for his defence.

In Article HE, Section 2, the right of trial by
jury, in criminal cases, is secured in the courts of
the United States: here this privilege is more care-c—
fully guarded, The trial is to be speedy, so that
the accused need not remain in prison-, as has often
been the case. The trial is also to take place in
the district where the alleged crime was committed
-—for it would he unjust to take the criminal to a
distant place for trial, where the means of evidence
were not likely t.o he at hand. ,   I

He is also to be fully informed of the nature of
the charge against him, so that he may have the

opportunity of refuting it: he is to be confronted

with the witnesses against him, so that he may
question them; he is to have the power of compel»
ling witnesses in his favorito appear ; and is to have
the assistance of counsel for his defence.

All these provisions show how careful is our.

admirable Constitution to guard the rights of the
people: even a man charged with crimes of the
deepest dye, is still to enjoy all the means that
human Wisdom can devise, to obtain his discharge.
if he be innocent.

AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION. 

ART. VII.—-—In suits at common law, {where the value
in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars,the right of
trial by jury ‘shall be preserved ; and no fact tried by a
jury shall beotherwise re-examined in any court of the

United States, than according to the rules of the com-

mon law.

Here the trial by jury is secured, even in cases
not criminal, and where property only is concern~
bed: this extends merely to courts of the United
States. , I p i

In England, “common law” means that law
which is recognised by thevcourts, and founded in
custom, and not upon any positive enactments of
parliament. We have also our “common law,”
founded in custom and common sense, and the set-
tled practice of the‘ English courts: yet not to be
found in any acts of legislatures. A

liberty, on his giving security for his re-appear-
ance. This security consists in a bond signed by

Vresponsible persons, in which they engage to pay

a stipulated sum, if the person is not forthcoming
at the speciﬁed time. In this amendment it is pro.-
vided that the amount in the bail-bond shall be
reasonable; for if excessive bail could be required,

a person arrested, might, through the malice‘ of”

therule here laid down that these high oﬁicers of
the government are now chosen.

CHAPTER LII.

Review of the Constitution.

As the Constitution is the Very foundation of
our national government, we Americans cannot
study it too much, or understand it too well. All
citizens, especially, who have a right to vote,and
who therefore use an inﬂuence-for good or ‘ill in
gifviiig character to the actual, practical govern’-
ment, or administration, that .-springs out of the
Constitution, should know what it means; what it
requires, and what it prohibits.

In the first place, we remarks-that this Constitu~
tion establishes a confederation or federation of
states; hence it is called afedeml government: that
is, a league or union of several parties. It is a
partnership, in which the several states, with the
people thereof, are the parties, each having an in-
terest, and taking a share, in the good or ill that
may ﬂow from the union.   i °

It establishes a distribution of powers, as we
have before stated, into three branches: Legislatiive,
conferred on Congress‘; Execut/ive, conﬁded to the
President; and Judicial, entrusted to the federal
courts. It keeps these powers distinct, the design
beingto makeone branch a check on the other, so
as to prevent a dangerous degree of power from
sliding, into the hands of one man, or one set of
mi£F.1.-.- ,

ltrnakesc Congress the source whence the laws
proceed: it makes it theduty of the president to
see that the laws are executed; it makes it the
p1:ov$ince;of= the judges to interpret and apply the
laws tliaitis,-~to decide cases of dispute which arise
underathem.   l o

aavmw or THE CONSTITUTION. 213

The Constitution takes away from the ‘ifndi-y

vidual states, and gives to the ‘federal’ government,
all power to make treaties; to carry on war against

foreign nations; to have a standing army and a ‘

navy; to establish _post—ofﬁces and post-roads; to
establish navigation laws, c’ustom—houses, light-»

houses, and generally to regulate and control the .

great interests of commerce; to coin money; in
short, to preside over -those interests which affect
the whole country, asa nation.

While the Constitution thus takes from the states
and gives to the federal government, certain powers,
it leaves the states in possession of all that is not
thus expressly given away; it leaves the states,
still, as independent republics, to , carry on their
several governments, and to manage all their
affairs, as the people thereof may please, subject to
no restraint, except what the Constitution imposes.

The Constitution, applying to the whole country,
binds us together as a nation, of which a state is
only a member. It is the Constitution, therefore,
which is likely to form and fashion our national
character: it is. the national government, founded
on this, which is chieﬂy regarded by foreign coun-
tries; for it is the federal government, only, which

i makes treaties and holds ofﬁcial intercourse with

other nations. ,

  The Constitution is the great bulwark of our
liberties. Were it notfor this, what would prevent
two states from being involved in constant war’!
What would prevent a small state, -like Rhode

Island or Connecticut, from beingoppressed byca I

powerful state, like , New York? Wh-at would
protect a citizen of one state, passing sinttotanothen
from unjust taxation, imprisonment, or éopprese
sion, were it not for the Constitution? i

214 -CONGRESS.

From these considerations, it is clear, that every
person in the United States has a deepinterest in
the Constitution, which establishes a union of the
states, for the good of all. a Every citizen, there-
fore, is bound by a regard to his own interest, and
duty to his countrymen, to seek to perpetuate it; to
obey its laws, to, maintain its institutions, and to
carry it into effect, according to the wise and pa-
triotic intention of its framers. ,

CHAPTER L111.
Congress.

, THIS body, as before stated, is divided into two
houses, the Senate and Hoetse of Representatives.
They hold their sessions, separately, in two splen-
did rooms in the Capitol at 'Washington.  

Senators are chosen for six years; there are two
from each state; of course‘ there are ﬁfty-two mem~
bers. , A person. cannot hold a seat in the Senate,
who is under thirty years of age. Beside» itslegisa
lative powers, the Senate have the privilege of rati-
fying or rejecting treaties made by the President,
or persons nominated by him to oﬂice.

The tmembers of the House of Representatives
must be twenty—ﬁve years old: they are chosen,
by the people of the states theyrepresent, for two
years, ,According to the present apportionment,
which is seventy thousand six hundred and eighty
inhabitants to one representative, the number of
representatives is two hundred and twenty-seven,

THE ADMINISTRATION. 215

. The House of Representatives have the sole
power of impeachment; but the person impeached
must be tried by the Senate. The pay of the
members of both branches of Congress is eight dol-
lars a day, while at Washingtori, and twenty dol—-
lars, fees of travel, for every hundred miles.

c H A P T E B. L I V.
The Administration.

THE Constitution is ‘but a series of rules or
principles. To c‘arrypthese into effect, ofﬁcers must
be appointed. Upon the character of these per»
sons, the character of the government greatly _de«
pends: for as these are good or bad, the public
affairs will be wisely or unw-isely managed. . A

foolish man can hardly act otherwise tl1al’l,fOOl-«x
ishly, however excellent may be the laws which

he is called upon to administer. .
However good our Constitution may be, there-
fore, we cannot expect good practical government,
unless we put good men into oﬂice.» Even a good
tool will not out well of itself: in the handsof _a
bungler, -it will often do mischief. Our fathers,
then, in giving us an admirable Constitution, .left

us only a good tool“to work with, and we must take

the responsibility of seeing that it passes into the  

hands only of those who are skilful and honest;
thosei who lmow what is right, and those who love
What is right. ,

The President of the United States is the chief
officer of the . government; we look upon him,
accordingly, as especially called to administer the

as either barbarous or civilized, but are rather
semi-barbarous. » - E _:

Such a nation are the Turks of;Europe, who
have many marks of civilization; as‘, for instance,
they have a general sense of justice,.‘- much intelli-
gence, some books, many ingenious manufactures,
considerable commerce, and a settled government.
But they are still destitute of courts of justice,
"which, in general, protect life and property.
Might is too often the rule of right; Woman is the
slave of man; the office-holder is above the citi-
zen; the sultan andhis favorites may trample on
justice with impunity.

Nearly the same may be said of Egypt, Persia,
and most of the nations of India. In all these,
there is a defective morality, a loose state of pub»
lic opinion, a Want of justice in private dealings,
and an insecurity of life, liberty and property.

The civilized state does not necessarily exclude

‘ tyranny and oppression,for among some of the:

civilized nations of Europe, as Russia, Spain,‘ and
Austria, there is much of both. Nor does the
civilized state necessarily include a system of gov»
ernment which distributes equal justice to all;

‘Which places the poor on a level with the rich, and

the holder of oﬂice on tlie same footing as the citi-
zen. ,Most, _ or all the governments of Europe,

, exhibit some defects in these respects.;

Civilization implies a state of ' advancement

  towards perfection in fhuman society. All that

tends to make a peopleiéitidise, -happy, free and prose
perous,,-gtends to raise them in the scale of civiliza»
tion. All that tends to make a people less wise,
less happy, less free, or less prosperous, tends to.
sink them in the scale of civilization.

216 - THE PRESIDENT.

Constitution. iWe, therefore, call the President,
with his advisers, tire Admimstration. Thus, as
before remarked, we denominate Washingto11’s
period of government, Washington’s a&2nz'n-is-
z‘mtz'on, &c. a s

0-H A P T. E R L V.
The President, 850. v

THE President holds his oﬂice for four years, and
has a salary of $25,000 a year. 0 He is command-
er-in-chief of the army, the navy, and the militia
of the United States, when in actual service; he
signs or vetoes bills passed by Congress; and
receives ambassadors and other public ministers.
He also, by and with s the consent of the Senate,
appoints the chief naval, military, and civil officers
of the government, and signs their commissions.

In addition to all this, the President is charged
with the general welfare of the country, and the
execution of the laws; and he is required, from
time to time, to lay before Congress his views of
publicaffairs.   s T
_ The Vice President is president of the Senate,
with a salary of $6,000 a year. «In case of the
death of the President, he succeeds to his office.

The President is assisted by several persons, who
are his advisers. These consist of the Secretary of
State,. Secretaries of the Treasury, of the Navy, and
of War; the Attorney-General,‘ and the Postmas-
ter-General. ‘  

All these persons live in Washington, near the

THE PRESIDENT. 217’

President, and are frequently called upon by him

to furnish him information, and to offer him their P

counsel and assistance. They are generally selected
from among the ablest men in the nation, and each
one is supposed to be especially ﬁtted, by his char-

acter and former pursuits, for the particular place

assigned to him. —

The President not only calls upon these persons
separately for assistance, asoccasion may require,
but once or twice a Week they all meet together

at his house. When assembled, they form the  

Cabinet, and when met for consultation, they are
called the Cabinet Council. a

The cabinet being regarded as personal and con» ,

ﬁdential advisers of the President, are expected to
entertain the same political opinions as the Presi-»
dent himself, and are usually selected from the
President’ s political party. In this case, as in the
other, the President nominates the .members of the,
cabinet, and the Senate of the United States, in
secret session, conﬁrm or reject them, as they

P please. If rejected, the President makes other

nominations. l

A largeand responsible part of the duty of the A,

President consists in his nomination of persons to
oﬂice, including the secretaries, Judges, ambassa-
dors, charges, consuls, custom-house oﬂicers, naval

and military officers, postmasters, land agents, and

various otherpersons in the employ of the govern-

ment- The number of ofﬁcers he is called upon

to nominate, amounts, as before stated, to many
thousands’. »  

In all cases, it is necessary that the Senate should
conﬁrm the nomination, or the person does not hold
his place.

19

218 SECRETARY‘ or STATE.

The secret sessions of theSenate, in which they
discuss the nominations of the President, arecalled
Executive Sessions, because they then attend to
executive business. The characters ‘of persons
nominated, are freelydiscussed. Sometimes What
takes place during the discussions, transpires, and.
sometimes it remains under the seal of secrecy.

The secretaries are in England called ministers.
In that country, they have usually a seat in par~
liament, and take a leading part in the legislation
of the country; but in-the United States,» the execu-
itive department is more completely’separated«from.
the legislative, and the sec7“ez‘arz'es, or mim'ste7"s,'- or
members of the cabinet, have no seat in either

branch of Congress. The annual salaries of the

secretaries are $6,000 each.-
CHAPTER Lvr.
Secretary of   State.

THE“ Secretary of State has an oﬁice’ near the

  President’s house. This consists of _a large ediﬁce,
containing many rooms, in which there are numer-

ous clerks, all engaged in the business of the de-
partment. In these rooms, also, are deposited a
library for the use of the department, and a multi-

tude of papers and documents, which have accu~
lmulated forthe last ﬁfty years, belonging to the

business of the office.
The main duty of the Secretary of State is to

rnfanage the negociations of foreign countries; to

give instructions to our foreign ambassadors, to

SECRETARY or STATE. 219

charges and consuls, and to answer their letters; to

  receive the communications of the ‘various foreign

ambassadors who reside at ‘Washington, and to
answer them as directed by the President.

Beside this, the Secretary of State is charged
with the preparation of the census of the United
States, a general supervision of the Patent Office,
and keeping the evidence of copyrights. He also
has charge of the federal seal, and preserves the
originalsof the laws and of treaties.

The Secretary of State in thispcountry is gene-
rally considered as the highest officer in the cabi-
net; phetakes the rank of what is called P7'em/ier
in England and France. His dutiescare of the
most important kind, requiring an intin1ateknow-
ledge not only of our own, but of foreign countries.
He not only is required to know the’ geographical
position, the commerce, the resources, the charac—
terof foreign countries, but he must know the
nature of their governments, the character and
disposition of the kingrand ministers and leading
men in each. 3  

To this vast amount of knowledge, the secretary
should add the greatest coolness and calmness of
temper, and sagacity of mind. In managing
affaii's with the agents of foreign countries, called
diplomacy, he must watch over every _word and
action, for peace and war depend upon his conduct.
It has frequently happened, in the history of man«.
kind, that an unlucky expression, or careless
phrase, used by a Secretary of State, has involved
powerful-nations in all the horrors of war.

Several eminent statesmen have held this high
oﬂice; as Thomas Jefferson, John Randolph‘,
John Marshall and James iMonr'oe, of Virginia;

‘Z20 SECRETARY. or THE TREASURY.

John Pickering, John Quincy Adams, and Daniel
Webste1', -of *1V.l‘asfsachusetts; Henry Clay of Ken-’
tucky, Edward Livingston, of Louisiana; and
MartinVan Buren, of NewlYork.

CHAPTER LVII.
Secretary of the Treasury.

THE Treasury Depazrtmevzt is held in ‘a large and
handsome ediﬁce, contiguous to the office of the
Secretary of State. Here is a library, and a variety
of subordinate ofﬁces, ﬁlled with books and papers.
Here also is the ofﬁceof the Treasurer, who has
immediate charge of the public money," the Camp
trailer‘, who has the supervision of the public ac—
counts; and several Auclitors, whose duty it is to
examine accounts. Beside these, there are in the
department a multitude of clerks. r‘

The Secretary of the Treasury presides over this
whole department; the special duty assigned him

is to watch over the money affairs of the govern—

ment; to see to the collection of the revenue at the
various custom houses and land oﬂices; to see that
the business is properly conducted at those places;
to seeto the disbursement of the public moneys, the
payment of salaries, liquidation of contracts, &c.

His duty is also, to advise the President and Con-
gress, as occasion may require, of the condition of
the public ﬁnances: to look forward, and devise
and recommend such plans, as may enable the gov-
ernment to raise the requisite amountof money, in
the manner least burthensome to the people.

SECRETARY or THE TREASURY. 221

A Secretary of the Treasury should be a man of

great arithmetical precision; familiar with the agri-
culture, trade, commerce, and manufactures of the

country, and with their products; he should under-,

stand foreign commerce; whence various articles
come ; where they are produced, and whether
they can advantageously be produced here ornot.

It has been already stated that the money wanted
by the government, is chieﬂy derived from duties
laid on foreign goods and merchandises. These
duties are in two forms——spec1§ﬁc and ad valorem.

A specegﬁc duty is that which imposes a speciﬁc
tax on a. speciﬁc article ,1 as three cents on a pound
of cotton; one cent on a pound of iron; four cents
on a. pound of coffee. ‘ _ g

An ad valorem, duty is a tax according to value,
as twenty per cent. on the cost or valuation of ar-
ticles. When the duty is so much on the cost, then
it is rated on the invoice; when it is according
to valuation, appraisers belonging to the custom-
house, appraise the goods, and the twenty per cent.
is received on the amount of the appraisal.

All this business of collecting the duties is man-
aged at the custom-houses. At the head of each
custom—house is a collector, and under him, a saw»
‘veg/or of the port, naval 0 ﬁlcer, inspectors, measm~e7‘8,
appraisers, and a multitude of clerks. About ﬁve
hundred persons are attached to the custom house
at New York; and near a hundred to that at
Boston. T s *

When a vessel arrives at a port of the United
States, she is entered by the captain on the books
ofthe custom-house, and taken in charge, with her

whole cargo, by the ofﬁcers thereof-——appointedr

to their several especiﬁc duties. An" account is
19*‘

222 SECRETARY or THE TREASURY.

taken of her cargo, and the duties ﬁxed by law’
must be paid. to- the collector or hisdeputy. It

is the money thus collected which forms the chief

support of the government of the United States.
The watching over the several custom-houses
of the country is a vast concern, and requires not
only greatpcapacity, and familiarity withcﬁnancial
aﬁ’ai‘rs, but it also requires untiring industry, vigi-
lance and care. Wherethere is money, there is
danger of corruption. , It is therefore indispensable
that not only an honest but a sagacious man be at
the head of the great moneydepartrnent of the gov-
ernment, so as. to detect errors and punish fraud,
and thus save the people from plunder. ’ —
Thereisanother important thing to be consid-
ered, here. In’ laying. duties upon foreign goods, we
not only Wish to collect revenues, but it is also
thought by some politicians,to bethe duty of the

government to lay them in such a manner as to

gorotecit and encourage the industry of our own
country. This can be done by layingduties on

articles which We produce, suchas butter, cheese,

wool, beef, cotton cloths, woollen cloths, iron
manufactures, &c. r

If duties are laid on these articlesas they come
from foreign countries, they will either not be sent

‘here at all, or the price of T them will be raised, so

as to give encouragement and protection to our
own producers; it will drive, away the foreign pro-

ductions, or raise the price; thus giving the entire‘
market, or a better market, to their productionsof .

our home, industry.
The rate of duties is called a tamiﬁ”; and a pro‘-

, tective tarzgﬂ’ is such a rate of duties as is designed

to protect. and encourage our. ownproducers; to

SECRETARY or THE TREASURY. 223

enable them to get higher prices than they would
getsotherwise. Labor is cheaper in England and

France and Germany than in the United States»;

and if we do not tax the productions of that labor,
as they come here, it is said. thatthe Wages of labor
must here sink to nearly the European level.
Beside all this, it is thought desirable that we
should have a variety of arts and trades among us,-
so that every person mayiﬁnd that employment
which suits his taste and genius; so that all the
various resources of t the country, animal, vegetable,
mineral, physical, social, and moral, may ﬁnd de-
velopment; and that we may produce. Within our-

selves, all we want to eat, drink, wear, and use: K

thus to secure our independence intime of War,
and whentour ports may be blockaded.   V
For these various reasons, and others, it IS

claimed by some i politicians, that we should adopt-

a. ']97'oz‘ecm"ve policy, in laying duties; ‘ a policy, the
purpose of which is to tax foreign articles which
come in competition with our own products, and
thus enable our producers to get higher prices than
they would otherwise obtain. This policy was
adopted inthe outset of the government, under the
Constitution, andhas prevailed during the greater
part of the time, since. It may be added, that a
similar policy is adopted in all other civilized
countries.   i ,

But there are statesmen among us who hold
that this protection is partial; that it takes money

out of the pockets of one class, and puts it into those,

of a another. They maintain that if you put a tax
on foreign cloths, you raise the price of the article
here, and enable the manufacturer to get larger

proﬁts: and as the people at large must buy’ their ‘

.224 SECRETARY or THE TREASURY.

clothes, this higher price comes out of their purses

and goes into those of the manufacturers- *~This

beneﬁt of the producer.  
Those who hold these opinions, generally repu-
diate the protective system, and insist that free

they consider a tax upon the consumer for the

trade is the true policy of nations. They would

raise no revenue from duties ; they would have no

custom—houses, they would let the ships of the

world come, and buy and sell without restraint.
To supply the expenses of government they would
resort to direct taxation.

Some of these politicians insist, if we are not
yet prepared for free trade, that still,the Consti—
tution does not authorize taxation, or the laying
of duties for. any other purpose than revenue: that
the rate should he, therefore, uniform; and conse-
quently they advocate what is called a horizontal
rate of duties, as twenty per cent., for instance, on
the value of all imported articles ; or at least that
nothing shall range higher than this general scale.

These persons say that if manufacturers, or

agriculturists derive accidental or incidental protec—
tion from this horizontal range of duties, it is all
very well : but you must not lay a lighteror hea-
vier duty, with a view to protection. They oppose,
therefore, as unconstitutional, discriminating du-
ties, or protective duties ; that is, duties varied with
a view to protection: the only protection they ap-
prove, is that which is accidental and undesignedi

or, to use the common phrase, incidental.   Every

revenue act which is framed with a view to
encourage the producers of the country, is deemed
a trespass upon the Constitution.

sncanmnv or THE TREASURY. 225 T

We shall not undertake to decide between these

two opposite schools-—-—‘the friends of a protective

policy, and the friends of free t7*ade——-further than

to state a, fact that ought not to be lost sight of, T

viz. , that the former has generally prevailed from
the foundationpof the government, and, right or
wrong, the state of things is adjusted to it. .
Leaving this dispute to the politicians, we remark
that the Secretary of the Treasury is called upon
for a multiplicity of facts and views, which relate
to the various questions that occur in Congress,
touching ﬁnance, revenue, &c. It is indispensable,
therefore, that he be a man of accuracy, and

of minute as well as extensive information, upon’.

ﬁnancial matters. p

The annual expenses of the government may be
stated at about twenty-ﬁye millions of dollars.
About twenty millions are obtained by customs.
The other‘ great source of revenue is the public

a lands. -

l These consist of vasttracts in the western coun-«
try, amounting to a‘ thousand millions of acres.
The price at which they are sold, is one dollar and
twenty-ﬁve cents the acre. The annual proceeds
of the sales have varied from two to twenty mil»
lions. In .1841, a law was passed, giving theiprog
ceeds of these lands to the several states; but this
policy is yet unsettled. The land office is attached
to the treasury department. 4 T

In the treasury building is also an oﬂice devoted
to the affairs of the Mint. This latter was estab-
lished at Philadelphia, in 1792, and in "1835 a
branch was established at New Orleans‘, for the
coinage of gold and silver. There are br'ancltes'
also for the coining of gold" at Charlotte, North

CIVIL SOCIETY. ~ " 19

In ﬁxing the comparative degree of civilization
towhich any countryis entitled, we have "to con-»
sider the situation of the whole people in respect to
wisdom, happiness, freedom and ‘prosperity. Judg-
ing by this rule, we may claim the ﬁrst rank for our
own country, and after this, England, France, Hol-
land, Belgium, and Prussia. The other nations of

, Europe may be ranked as follows: the German
nations generally; the Swedes, the Swiss, Danes,
Spaniards, Italians, Greeks, Russians, and Turks.

several branches are under the control of the di-
rector of the mint at Philadelphia. The records
of these several establishments are kept in the
appropriate office, in the Treasury Department.

CHAPTER LVI-II.

Secretary of War.

THE War‘ Department is an extensive building
near the President’s house, which contains various
rooms, to accornmodate the several officers attach-
ed to the establishment.

The Secretary of War has charge of the army,
and of the forts and garrisons of the United States.

He is also charged with Indian affairs; thatis, the

execution of treaties with the tribes of Indians
along our Western frontier.   H

He is ‘charged with the providing of muskets,
cannon, and other munitions of war, and their pre-
servation in the diﬁ‘eren.t arsenals throughout the
country. He is charged with the marching of

troops to their destination; the providing and

transporting of military stores, &c.

In time of peace the duties of this oﬂicer are
extensive, but in time of .war, theyrare in -the
highest degree arduous and responsible.

The army is under the command of a lVIajor—
General, who is styled the commander-in-chief,
and who has his head—quarters at Washington.
There are two divisions of the army, at the head
of each of which is a Brigadier—General. The

SECRETARY‘ or THE NAVY. 227

aggregate of the army is about eight thousand
men, and the annual expense is about four mil-
lions of dollars.

CHAPTER   pix.
Secretary of the Navy.

  THE Navy. Department is near the President’s
house. The duties of the Secretary, are to take
charge of the N avy; to see to the building of ships,

their equipment, and their ﬁtting out with men

and stores; to see to the care of them while in or-
dinary, that is, laid up in port; to plan voyages and
cruises; in short, tosuperintend the whole business
of the Navy. g ~ , i

There _are several Navy Yards in the United
States, where vessels are built, reﬁtted, and taken
care of while in ordinary. These are vast estab-#
lishments, and attended by great numbers “of
persons. The principal are at Washington, Phila-
delphia, Norfolk, and Oharlestown, near Boston.
-   At Washiiigtoii there is a board of Naval Com-
missioners, consisting of three officers of the navy,
whose duty it is to see to thecdetail of constructing
and employing the public vessels, under the super-
intendence of the Secretary". ,

The Navy, though on a small scale, acquired
great reputation in the War with Englandof 1812,

and it is now a favorite with the nation. The

whole number of ships, rsloops, and steam vessels,
belonging to the United States, is about ninety..
The whole number of persons employed in and

about them is nearly ten thousand. The annual.

expense is about seven millions of dollars.

a deputy postmaster, and Various other officers.

The number of post—oﬂices in the United States
is about fourteen thousand : the Whole extent of all

the post routes is about one hundred and ﬁfty

1 Patent Office.

THE Paieirzt Oﬁce is one of the ﬁnest ediﬁces in
the United States, and is situated nearthe General
Post Ofﬁce. Here models of new inventions are de-
posited, and the Superintendent issues Zetz‘e7's jaaytent,
or patent rights, for new and useful inventions.

By virtue of these grants, the patentees are ena-
bled to have the exclusive making and vending of
their inventions for fourteen years. The object of
this is to encourage useful improvements, by giv-
ing the proﬁts thereof to the inventors for the stip-
ulated period. T F '

The models now lodged in the Patent Oﬂice
are ~numerous, ‘ ingenious, and interesting, though
many were destroyed in the Patent Office, burnt
down a few years since. * Those which exist, afford
a.,_ pleasing evidence of the ingenuity of our coun-
trymen. The Whole number of patents issued since
1790, is over twelve thousand. »

7B’eside these models, there are various articles
of curiosity, belonging to the government of the

~ United States; such as the uniform Worn by Wash-

ington when he took leave -of the army; various
rich gifts presented by foreign princes; and a great
‘collection of specimens in natural history, particu-
larly ornithology, conchology, botany, &,-c. .
The Patent Ofﬁce is under the charge of a Su-_
peréntendent, who is assisted by various draftsmen,
clerks, and others. The Whole establishment is
-subject to the supervisionof the Secretary of State.

. It is one of the most interesting objectsat the seat

of government.

CHAPTER LXIIL
Judiciary.

THE Judiciary of the United States consists’ of a
Supreme Court, nine C'i7~cu2't Courts, and thirty
District Courz‘s.i The judges are nominated by
the President, and submitted for approval or rejec-
tion, to the Senate. t They hold ‘ofiice during good
behavior. , 

The Supreme Court is composed of a c/uief jus-
twice and eight rzssocictte judges, who hold a court
every winter at Washingtoii. Each of the judges
also attends a certain circuit, comprising several

_ districts. In each d.istrict he holds a Circuit’Court

at stated times, being assisted by at local judge,

. called a district judge. TheiDistrict- Courts are

held by thedistrict judges, alone.
All these , circuit and district courts are inferior
to the Supreme Court, and their decisions are liable

to be overruled by it. The Supreme Court isthe ,

highest judicial tribunal in the country, and its de-
cisions are ﬁnal. It can even decide upon the acts

of Congress, and declare them to be ,llI1COI1Sl}llCll~-

tional, and therefore void. ,

It will be remarked, however, that cases which
arise under state laws, between citizens of the
same state, cannot be brought before the United
States Court; This court has jurisdiction (that is,
the power of acting and judging)_only in cases
which arise under the laws of Congress, or between
citizens of diﬂerent states, and a few other cases.
The state courts adjudge all cases between their
own citizens.

JUDICIARY. 231

In each district there is a Dz'st7~*ict Az‘z‘omey, Whose
duty itis to prosecute all offences against the laws
of the United States; such,for instance, as piracy,
which is robbery upon the high seas ; or smuggling
goods; that is, bringing them into the country with
a View to avoid paying duties. The District Attor—
ney also manages all cases in which the United
States are a party. [ e

In each district is a iMarshal, who performs the
duties of asheriff ; that is, he attends the court of
the district, and executes the precepts directed to

him. He keeps persons accused of crimes in cus-

tody, and when required, brings them before the

court; he also executes sentence upon criminals,

and in general, is the executive ofﬁcer of the
court. " i t
Each district has a placevvhere the court sits
and where. its records are kept; and here a clerk
attends to the business of the office. It is in these
offices that the titles of books are deposited, upon

which authors desire to obtain copyright. The-

clerk issues certificates that such titles are depos-

. ited; and when his book is published, the author

leaves a copy at the clerk’s office; his copyright
is then complete; and he only, and those Whom he

, may authorize, have a ‘right to print or publish it.

Thesalary of the chief justice is ﬁve thousand
dollars. a year: each of the associate judges has
four thousand five hundred dollars; the district
judges receive from one thousand to three thousand
dollars a year.

Among the eminent men Who have held the
oﬂice of chief justice of theeUnited States Court,
are Oliver Ellsworth, of Connecticut, who died in
1807, and John Marshall, who died in 1838.

CHAPTER LXIV.

State Governments.

WE have now taken a brief view of the izational

» government.’ that government which binds twenty»

six separate states or republics, into one great fed-
-eral republic. Let us now _take a survey of the
several states, which are at present "twenty—six in
number. s t ’

Each of the states has a written constitution;
sonieiof these were adopted during the revolution-
ary struggle, and have since been revised, remod-=
dled or amended. Others have been made anew,
at later periods. Rhode Island is the only state
which retains its colonial charter. _tEﬂ"orts are now
making in this state for the adoption of anew
constitution, which are likelyto prove successful.

Several of the state ‘constitutionsconsist of two
parts, first a bill of rights, setting forth certain
abstract principles of government and law; and
second, a series of rules for the 07‘gam3zation and
admz'm'.s'z‘raz‘z'07z of the government. V i

All these constitutions prescribe, a republican
form of government; that is, a government in
which the people choose certain officers to repre-y
sent them, and act for them in public affairs.

In all the state constitutions, provision is made
for keeping the three powers———legislative, execu-
tive, and judicialwdistinct and separate.

In every state there is a Governor, and in most
a Lieutenant Governor. The Governor constitutes
the executive branch, being assisted in some cases
by an executive council. He is generally the

STATE GOVERNMENTS. 233

commander-in-chief of the state militia; appoints
and commissions various, officers, and has a gene-
ral superintendence of public affairs.

In most of the states the Governor is elected for
a single year. In some instances, he is elected for
a longer time, as in New York, North Carolina,

  Georgia, and some Q_th61‘S, for two years; Pennsyl-

vania, Virginia, Indiana, for three years; Dela-
ware, Louisiana, Arkansas, for four years. None
are elected for a longer term than the last period.

In some states the Governor is elected by the leg-

islature, but in most instances by the people.

In all cases the legislature consists of two
branches, a House of Representatives and a Senate.
No bill can become a law unless sanctioned by

‘both houses. The Governor has also a veto in

most cases.  I ‘» ‘ b

The legislatures of - the several states usually
meet once a year. In some cases, however, their
sessions are held but once’ in two years‘. The
qualiﬁcations required for members of the legisla-
ture, are various. In a majority of states, citizen-
ship, possession of a certain amount of real‘ estate,
and being over twenty-ﬁve years of ‘age, are requi-
sites.

The Judiciary of the several states consists of ‘a

superior court, and several inferior courts, arranged

Somewhat after the model of the United States’
courts. The judges are generally appointed by the
legislature, in some instances , annually, in others
for a term of years, and in others during good be-
havior.  

All the states are divided into counties. In each
county there is a court-house where courts are
held, and where various records are kept. Each

court has a clerk to record itsproceedings, and a
sheriff or other oﬂicer to execute its precepts.
There are also county and state prisons for the
conﬁnement of those who are under arrest, ‘or who
are convicted of crimes and misdemeanors.

tunishments.

IN barbarous ages, especially in despotic coun-
tries, the punishments foroffences against the state
have always been numerous and cruel. Torture
and death have been ‘inflicted in thousands of
cases, not only for such high oﬁences ‘as treason,
robbery and murder, but for more trivial misde-
meanors, and even for holding particular religious
opinions, and those’ which are now regarded as
right by a large part of the Christian world. ,

Even in England, where the criminal code has
been softened with the progress of civilization,
down to a recent period the laws made about two
hundred oifences capital crimes; that is, punisha-
ble with.death. A change has very lately taken

place, and the number of capital offences now-

known to the English law, are only thirteen
among which are the following :— “
Treason ,°r murder ; attempt to murder, by ad-
ministering poison; attempt to murder, by stab-
bing; piracy, attended by an attempt t.o murder;
robbery, with an attempt to murder; burglary,
(that is, breaking into a house between nine
o’clock at night and six o’clock in the morning,)

P

with an attempt to murder; arson, that is, setting
ﬁre to a dwelling-house _with any person therein;
ex/2,ibitz'ng any false light, with an intent to bring
a vessel into danger; and every accessary before
t/ze fact, to any one of the above offences.

Most of these offences havebeen punished with
death inthis country; but there has been and still
is a growing aversion to capital punishment. The
belief extensively prevails, that a rmild code is
more effectual in checking crime, than a’ san-
guinary one ; and under the inﬂuencevof these
views, only a few of the more atrocious crimes are
now punished, in this country, with death.

Imprisonment, with conﬁnement to hard labor,
and in some instances solitary conﬁnement, are now
the chief inﬂictions of the law for crimes against
the public. Piracy,‘ cognisable by the United
States’ courts, and murder by the state courts, are
universally punished with death.  

  Imprisonment for debt, a common practice in
most other countries, is nearly abolished in the
states. If a person, has no property, and will take
oath to that effect, he can obtain his release from
imprisonment for debt. This is a great mitigation
of former laws; for once a creditor could keep his
debtor in prison as long as he pleased, even if he
had not a farthing of property. The law‘ gave
the creditor entire power over the body of the
debtor, and this is still the fact in some European
countries.

20 CIVIL SOCIETY.

children,‘and children to the parent. These ties
and obligations are founded in the best good of the
Whole family: that is, the parents are bound to
fulﬁl certain duties, and the children to fulﬁl
certain duties, because the best good of all is con-
cerned. , T ‘ ,

Thus anynumber of individuals, unitedby cer-
tain ties, constitute society; but a society_may

be instituted for particular purposes and of__ a lim--‘

ited nature. An insurance company isa society,
for special. objects, and its obligations are restricted
to these. 4 ’

Civil society is that of the state, in which all
the people are united under a government for the
best good of all. This civil society,-constituting
the state, is society of the highest and most impor—
tant kind, because it involves the happiness of all,
and reaches every interest and transaction of
life. ’ i T

The obligations of civil society, or obligations to

Eifthe state, are therefore deserving of great attention,

;because they relate to the happiness, of the whole
nation, and to all the interests of every. inch»
jvidual. , T y

 Thus, in all the several conditions in Which.
mankind are to be found, Whether in a savage,
barbarous, or civilized state," we observe three
*things——:where several people live together, there
is society; and where there is society there is

‘government, and where there is government there

is arnultipliedsystem of obligations imposed upon
all the members and subjects of it.

Qualifications of Voteifs.

l THE chief distinction between our political sys-=
tem and the systems of other countries, is in the
freedom of our elections. In England, France,
Spain and some other countries, the rig/22‘ of .s'z.g”-—
fmge, z‘/ze eZecz‘i«vefra12c/rise, or in other words, the
privilege of voting for public cﬂicers, exists, but it
is enjoyed only by a few persons, and those having
considerable property. In this country the inval—-
uable right of suﬁ‘"rage is much more extended. in
most of the states, every citizen who has resided in
a place for a few months, and pa-id a tax, is enti—
tied to vote there in the elections for all public
officers. ,' " ,

In the earlier periods of our state governments,
the right of suffrage was not ‘enjoyed exceptby
persons holding landed estat.e :, this right has been
gradually extended, so as to be nearly universal,
in almost all the states. _ r

In Rhode Island, as the original colonial charter,
granted in 1663, is in force, and formsthe basis of
the government to the present day, the ancient
qualifications of voters are still required, among
which is the holding of real estate to the value’ of
one hundred and thirty—four dollars. This restraint
upon the elective franchise, or right of voting, has

been a just cause of complaint, among a part of -

the citizens of Rhode Island, for many years, and
as their Wishes have been steadily resisted, the
feeling of resentment broke out into open insurrec-
tion in 1842. e i ’

QUALIFICATIONS or VOTERS. 237

An informal convention had been called the year
previous, which formed a constitution: this being
submitted to the people, was said to be accepted by
a majority. Under this, anelection was held; a
governor by the name of Dorr was elected, with.
a senate and representatives. Dorr resorted to
arms to establish this government, but was driven
out of the state by the regular government.

A It is to be hoped that the portion of the people
of Rhode Island opposed to the extension of suf-

frage, called the charter party,-and who have pre~ i

vented the formation of a liberal constitution, will
see the policy and justice of adopting a. written
constitution, as liberal, in respect to. suffrage and
other matters, as the constitutions of the adjacent
states of Massachusetts and Connecticut.

There is no one point upon which the American
people are more justly jealous than upon this of
suffrage. .They not only claim that it shall be

extensively enjoyed, but they insist upon voting

by ballot. ‘ This isdone by putting a piece of paper,

T with the name of the person voted for, into a box,

called the ballot-box. This is done so that no one
need see or know who a person votes for. The
advantage of this mode of voting, is that every man
may vote independently; that even the poor and
dependent may vote as they like, without being
o.verawed by the rich, or those who have some
power over them. i

. It will be perceived that in political affairs,
women and children do /not vote. It may be asked,
what right has society to exclude these persons
from so dear a privilege as that of the elective:

‘franchise ?- The answer is, that the good of so-

ciety, and the good of those thus restrained, is best

238 THE MAJORITY. .

consulted by such a course. If Women were to
engage in party strife, they would lose the respect

they now receive from men, and by which they eX-  

ercise a powerful influence over them. If children
Were to vote, they would do i.t ignorantly and
capriciously, and thus injure themselves and
others, by imparting their ignorance and Caprice to
the affairs of government. It may be remarked
that these views are so clear and conclusive, that
in no political system has the right of suffrage ever
been granted to women or children.

CHAPTERTLXVII.
The Majority.

THE great principle that lies at the foundation
of our government is, that the people are to rule;
and the way to ascertain What the people wish, is,
in a formal and careful manner, to ascertain the

decision of the enajority. The majority having
expressed their Views, the rest of the people

acquiesce.  

Thus, in forming a constitution, if the larger
number of persons qualiﬁed to vote, declare in
favor of it; that is, if a majomlzfy vote for it, it is
considered as adopted by the people; the smaller
number, the minority, being bound to submit and
support the constitution thus established.

It is the samein the choice of members of Con-
gress, governors of states, &c. The candidate (that
is, the person who is held up before the people for

POLITICAL PARTIES. ' 239

a particular office) must have a majority of votes,
or more votes than all other persons, in order to be
declared elected. T  

This is the case in almost all the states. In some
instances, in the choice of .officers, the person who
has a plurality of votes, (that is, the highest. num-
ber of votes, or A more votes than any other,) is
declared elected. . '

It may be asked Why the minority should submit
to the wztcgority ?-—in other Words, what right has the
majority to rule? "We answer, that in this ‘Way
alone can popular government be carried on. A.
majority and a minority being always opposed to
each other, one must yield: of course, the few must
give Way to the many. The voice of the majority
is therefore taken as the voice of the Whole. The
obligation of the minority to submit, lies in this--
that in no other Way can government be sustained.
To resist the decision of a majority is to declare
for anarchy, or revolution.

CHAPTER LXVIII.
Pclitical Parties.

POLITICAL parties have existed in all free govern-
ments. They spring from the different views which
differentpersons take of great questions affecting
the public interest. Persons entertaining the same
‘views will associate together, and act together, to
carry the measures they approve, and to defeat those
they condemn. . Other persons, entertaining oppo-
site views, will also associate together to counter»

act the operations of the ﬁrst party, thus formed.

240 ' POLITICAL PARTIES.

Thus one party always begets another; and
as ambitious individuals are apt to put themselves
at the head of these several parties, and excite
them against each other, there is usually a good
deal of bitterness betweenthem. It has often hap~
pened that persons have become so devoted to
party, as to forget their country; and in some
instances patriotism has been swallowed up in
party spirit. ' V

In Greece and Rome, the people were divided
into parties, and in England we have witnessed.
the same state of things. The terms I/V12/ig and
Tory, have longibeen used to denote the two

leading parties: the ﬁrst professing to be the peo-’

ple’s party, and to aim‘ at taking power from the
crown and giving it to the people; the latter
being the king’s party, and aiming to take power
from the people and give it to the crown.

These terms were adopted in this country during
the revolution; the friends of liberty and indepen~
dence taking the name of w/tigs; those who ad-
hered to the king and opposed the revolution,
being called tories. Still more recently, one of the
political parties here has assumed the title of w/zig,
meaning thereby to declare their opposition to
executive encroachments; and these have applied,
asa term of reproach, the name of tories to their
opponents. r

Soon after the adoption of the constitution, it
was seen that different views were entertained as to
its construction and administration. Some persons
feared that the national government would be too
Weak, and therefore lea.ned towards giving the con«
stitution a Zibeml c0:rz,st2'2..:cz!-27077,, so as to extend the

powers of the fcclemly govemmem‘ ; and hence they

eoL1'rIcAL PARTIES. 241

were called fede7'aZ13stsi - Among them was Wash-

ington and Alexander Hamilton; and the party

they led was called the federal paid;/.

0n the other hand, there ,were persons, Who,
instead of fearing that the federal, government
would not besstrong enough, apprehended that it
woiild be too strong,’ that it wouldswallow’ up
the statesgovernments, and become a sort of des-
potism. Among‘ these were Thomas Jefferson and
James Madison “These latter called themselves
atﬁrst, 7’epa‘b'Zicans, and afterwards they and their
followers were styled democrats. ‘

The politicians of} the country, and indeed
n'ear_ly all thecitizens, continued divided between
these two great partie's———federa1ists and demo-
crats—-—-from 1800 to the close of the war in
1815, when they seemed to cease. Both these
terms have, however, been revived within the last
;€'ew years. The party which supported General
;iacks‘on, assumed the title of democrats; and as
whigs called them, in reproach, tories, ‘they in
return denominated the’ Whigs, federalism. "

Among the various means resorted to by
political parties to carry on their measures, are
'eo2went«ions, called forthe purpose of nominating,
that is, recommending candidates for office. The
eoiivent_ions’ consist of delegates, sent by the people
eftlie party=calling the convention, and when they
have agreed upon a" candidate, they recommend
him to the voters, and he usually receives the

"support of his party.

lt might appear at ﬁrst view that there were

serious‘ objections to this course of proceeding,

inasmuch as it seems to interfere ,with a free ex-

pression’ of the public will. But it is to be con-

sideredi that no person can be elected unless he
has a majority of all the votes: if, therefore, no
means were taken to concentrate public opinion,
the votes would be scattered upon a multitude of
candidates, and no one would be chosen.

In the southern and Western states, persons
offer themselves as candidates, ‘particularly for
Congress, and thus the people’ sattention is directed
to a few leading’ candidates. These-go from place
to place, addressingcollections of people in the
district, and setting forth their opinions, views, and
principles. . g   r  

A common method of c'onfe:‘=.ring upon public
aifairs, among political parties, is to hold a kind of
preliminary meeting, called a ccmcus, at ‘Wlllclti
leading individuals compare opinions, and devise
their plans of proceeding.

tvould prevaii; that peace, order, and justice can
only exist: where government is established, and

where the peiople submit to the laws.

Government is designed, or ought to be designed,
for the good of the people; and when it is Wisely
framed and Well administered, it is one of the
greatest of earthly blessings. Suchia government

_ may be compared toa good house, comfortable and

convenient, and protecting every member of the
family alike from the storms and tempests of the
season. i T   _ T ‘
Now We .suppose our American-system of govern-
ment to be thus wisely contrivedand happily ad~
‘111',l,I1lS126I‘8(Zl, and like the good, comfortable house, to
afford shelterand protection to all. Shall We not,

then, give it our cheerfull support? Wouldc We not ‘

watch over our dwelling, repair defects, remedy
decay, defend it from the attacks of enemies, and
quench the ﬁre that threatens its destruction? And
shall we not do as much for that government which
is the shelter of the whole nation, and as necessary
to our peace and protection as the very roofs over
our heads   . i .  

And 11oW*i11 what way can we aid and‘ "support
the government '2 u 5

~ 1. When at a proper age, we must pay taxes ,- for
it is impossible that government should be carried
on Without money“ Public ofﬁcers, who spend
their time for thebenefit of the people, must-have
support: they must have food and clothing and
\shelter; and if constantly employed in the business
of the public, how‘ can they provide these things’!
The only way is for the public to pay ‘them for
their services. , T   .

The president and vice-president, the governors
and lieutenant-governors;   the members of the
several legislatures; the judges, soldiers and sailors,
must receive their pay. The public buildings, the
ships, the forts, the light-houses, all require money,
as well in their construction as for their current
expenses. r
_ Although these things demand vast sums of

money, when taken together, the cost to each indi-
vidual is very little, There are seventeen millions
of people in the United ‘States, and the Whole ex-
penses of the national government are not more
than twenty-ﬁve millions of dollars a year: this is
only about a dollar and a half for each man, Woman
and child. And surely a dollar and a half a year is
a small sum to pay. for such blessings as‘ our na-
tional governnieiit ‘bestows. ‘The expenses‘ of our
state governmeii-ts;  somewliat less than those

of   the iiational government.

2. Beside paying our money for the supporteof
government, at a proper age we aretoalled upon; to

do military dirty, and if need be, to ﬁght the ene-e

mies of our coiintry, l3‘rom this duty W8 surely

  ought not to shrink, unless from religious s,cr.uples.?*

A Thepeoplee-—the voters—i—-~choose»the rulers, and A

are therefore responsible for the manner in which
the government is carrieﬁl on. From thisifact sev-
eral important consequences ﬂow. ,  
If a man votes ,for, a bad ruler, he does what‘ he
can to injure himself, hisfamily, his ineig/tbors and
his country ; because, in voting for a bad ruler, la
freeman votes for bad government.’   ‘ ‘
I If A a freeman stays away from the polls, and re«—
fuses or neglects to -vote, he neglects oneﬁof the
greatest and highest duties’. He belongs to a‘coun~
try ‘Witha representative government: a govern-
ment in "which all ought. to be represented;-athe high
and low, the rich and poor, the learned and un—

the people are not represented, and therefore We

And beside this, if a man refuse to Vote, how
can he be sure that bad men will not assemble at
the polls, and put in bad rulers? He who stays

away from the pollsis answerablelfor all the evil‘

consequences which may follow from his neglect.

as in acting for “himself. A A -man’ is bound to use
the samecvlgilance, in acting for his country, as in

‘society begins, and mutual obligations follow.

He is no longer independent and at liberty to act
for himself alone, but he is bound by the great
rule, “ Do to another as you would have another
do to you.” When a government is established,
civil society begins, and the duties and obligations
are extended to the Whole community.

CHAPTER VII.

Individual Property.

I HAVE already said that in some countries
property is held in common; there is no distri-
bution of it to individuals: the idea of mine and
zhivze does not exist. In this state of society

there is never any advance in civilization: the

people are always in a savage state.

2 As society advances, the custom prevails for an
individual to claim as his own, what he acquires
by his toil’, his enterprise, or his ingenuity. The
advantages of this are soon seen; for, stimulated
to exertion by knowing that what he acquires’ he
can. have to his own use and beneﬁt, each indi-
vidual is induced to be industrious, and to put
forth his best efforts. ' i . ,

'I‘he consequence of this is, that property is
increased, the Various arts are promoted, the com—
forts and necessaries of life are multiplsied, Thus

the state is enriched, and the Whole community is_

beneﬁted. In order to obtain the full advantages

erty and good government, shall they ever" neglect
or refuse to use this power’! Shall the American;
freeman abuse this power’! Shall’ he be dishonest
in the use of this power? Shall he ever act, in a
matter of vital. importance’ to his country, without
the good sense, or the honest purpose, that he ad-
mits should guide him in the affairs ofrcommon life?

This is a matter whichpl press upon myryoung:
friends with earne-stness, for there is a sad loose~-
ness in society, both of thought and action, respect-
ing politics. Some persons have held the creed‘

that “all is fair in polities ;” and it is to be ‘feared,

that this wicked and vicious maxim is partially
adopted in actionlby many persons who arehardly
aware of it.

Among the evidences of this corruption of the

public mind, we may remark thatsmany persons feel
thatthey may vote to gratify their ownlpersonal‘
feelings; many carry to the polls their personal‘
prejudices, leaving their patriotism at home;

they vote to -satisfy some grudge or fsorne whim ;r

some friendship or somehatei; they vete to effect a

personal, not a ‘patri;oti.e object All these are-‘
abuses of the high trust and noble privilege‘:

placed in the hands of voters. l i  r 7
It is thebounden duty of every freeman at the
polls to discard such unworthy,rr1otives;oto look,

with singleness of heart and hlonestye of a purpose,-
to consequences; and tocast’ his ballotfor   his‘

country, and notforilzimself. Such, indeed, will be

the case with every noble an upright lmind.—every

mind worthy of a V freeman’s privilege; every
mind‘ that is not bowed down to the idol of party,
and not the ignominious slave of selﬁsh and
narrow personal feeling-. i l

In order to contend successfully with the sinister
inﬂuences Whichattend us all in the field of poli-
tics, ‘I. know, of no better lesson than this———lez‘ us

5. Among the-duties of. citizens, the last I shall
notice, is the obligation to observe and support the
laws. As i have shown, in the early. part of this
work, every law is designed to»protect.us in some
of our rights and enjoyrn-ents gt and .though«each law
be a restraint upon absolute liberty, yet. it is for the
interest of each and all to support the laws. Every
man who violatesa law, not only does injustice or
inflicts injury‘, either public or private, but he sets
an evil example, and thus does a mischief to~«the
whole community. , He. not; only does a §ar‘ticu1.ar
wrong, but his conduct tends to break down the

fabric of government, and to rend-er all our rights

and privileges insecure.  A s __
;_ A violation of law is therefore aﬁgreat Wrong,
-and every good ci-'ti_zen‘ should beware of it. It

may be said, indeed, that a law may be unjust and’

oppressive———:ai1d the question will be asked, shall

_sucli a law be observed’! To this we reply, that

an unjust and oppressive. law « is not morally
binding uioon us. Still, inea free country like ours,
when We find aylavv upon the .statute book, We
have reason to believe that itis both just and sal-
utary; land. We‘ oughtfnot to resist it, until after
very mature deliberation, ample public discussion,
and the trial, and failure of all the ordinary modes
of effecting chaiiges in legitislation. '

248 DUTIES or. CITIZENS’.

I have but one thing more to nadd—s—-and that re»
spects the manner in which all political discus-
sions should he conducted. In the first place,
there should be a‘ strict observance of good breed-v
ing; there should be no ungentlemanly contradic-
tions; no imputation of bad‘, motives. 'I‘here
should beno heat of Words or manner ; ‘no display
of anger. All should be done in coolness and
kindness. .   , ’ _

In the second place, thereshould be perfect fair»
ness. In making statements, the one who offe‘r‘s

them should take the utmost care to see and‘lrnow"

that they are true: and, in the next placer,sonlys
such inferences or argumentsshould be deduced
from facts asare perfectly legitiniate; By fair dis-
cussions, conducted in la gentlemanlywvay, the

truth may be advanced; but no good. can flow front
angry disputes, or fI_'OI_Il?&lSl1’lg€111IOI;1S controversy.

i Let it be ever home in mind by my readers =tha.t

it never can be the ~in‘terest of an inquirer to be
cheated or duped : therefore trutiz is the first object‘

tohim. Let: it be also remembered, that, with an
honorable mind, the first question-in respect to any
statement,always is this—-is it true ?—'~and nornan,
who is Worthy of being call=ed a man, will sconde-»
scend to use a statement, -eitherin making up his

own mind, or in attempting to exercise an inﬂuence,

upon others, till he knows that it is true.

Those who will use falsehood for party or polit-~
ical purposes-——or who will use that which theyrdoe
not know to be true, are alike base and contempt---
ible in the light of religion and honor. oA rpolit-
ical falsehood or trick is asbad as any other, and
even worse, for it imports ~mischief to the whole
community. ‘ '

The good people of the several colonies of New Hampshire,"
Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Newcastle,
Kent, and-Sussex, on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Caro-
lina, and South Carolina, justly alarmed at these arbitrary pro-
ceedings of parliament and ‘administration, have severally elected,
constituted,‘ and appointed deputies torneet and sit in general
congress, in the city, of‘ Philadelphia,,.in order to obtain such es-
tablishment, as that their religion, laws, and liberties. may not
be subverted; whereupon the deputies so appointed being new

these colonies, were, at’ the time of th’eir_‘emigrat.ion from the
mother country, entitledpto all the rights, liberties, and immuni-

provincial legislatures, where theirright of representation can
alone be preserved, in all cases of taxation and internal polity,
subject only to the negative of their sovereign, in such manner as
has been heretofore used and accustomed ; but, from the necessity

of the case, and a regard to the mutual interests of both countries,’

we cheerfully consent to the operation of such acts of the British

parliament, as are, 12072:; ﬁde, restrained to the regulation of our‘

external commerce, for the purpose of securing the commercial
advantages of the whole empire to the ~1'no'thercountry, and the-
commercial beneﬁts of itsrespective members; excluding every

idea of. taxation, internal or external, for raising a revenue on the .

subjects in America, without their consent. . '

lature of that colony in which such army is kept, is against law.

Resolved, N . 'C..D. 10. It is indispensably necessary to good

A DECLARATION by the represent'atives of theUnited States of
America, in congress assembled. . y ‘

‘When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for
one people to ‘dissolve the political bands which have connected
theme with_ another, and to assume, among the powers of the
earth, the separate and”equal station towhich the laws of nature,

-and of nature’s G-od, entitle’them,,a decent respect to the opinions

of mankind requiires, that they should declare the ‘causes which
impel them-to the separation. ‘  ‘ _ . . ' »
We hold these’ truthsto be self-evident : that allmen are crea-

ted equal; that they are endowed,‘ by their Creator, with‘ certain

unalienable rights; that among these, are life, liberty,Ian*d the

‘ pursuit of happiness. , That, to secure ‘these rights, governments

are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed ; that, Whenever any form of government
becomes destructive of these ends, it islthe right of the people to
alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its
foundationon such principles,- andorganiziin g its powers in such
form, as to them shall seem most likely’ to effect their safety and
happiness. Prudence, indeed; will dictate, that governments,
long established, should not be changed for light and transient
causes ; and accordingly, all experience hath shown, that mankind
are more disposed to suffer, while ‘evils are su.ﬁ“er‘able, than to
right themselves, by abolishing the forms. to which they are ac-
customed. But, when a. ‘long train of abuses and usurpations,
pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce
them under absolute despotism, it is their right, itis their duty,
to throw off" such government, and on provide- new guards for
their future security. Such has been the patient sulferancetof

these colonies; andsuch is now the necessity whic_h1'constrains[

them to alter their former -systems of ‘government. The history
of the present king of Great Britain is a history of repeated" inju~
rice and usurpations, all having, in direct object, the establishrnent
of an absolute tyranny’ over these states." To prove this, let facts
be‘ submitted to a candid world. 4 ' ’ =

right of representation in the legislature : a right inestimable’ to
them,‘ and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,
uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public
records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance
with his measures. . - ' . ,

He has dissolved. representative ‘houses, repeatedly, for opposing,
with manly ﬁrmness, his pinvasions on the rights of the people. ’

Heghas refused, ‘for a longtime, after such dissolutions, to
cause others-to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, inca-
pable of annihilation, have returned to the people at ‘large for
their exercise; the state remaining, in the mean time, exposed to
all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states;
forthat purpose, obstructing the laws for naturalization of for-
eigners; refusing to pass others- to encourage their migrations
hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.

He has obstructedthe administration of justice, by refusing
his assent tolaws for establishing judiciary powers. ’

He ‘has: made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure
of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of new ‘offices, and sent hither.

For taking away our charters, abolishingrou-r most valuable.

For suspending our own legisla_tures, anddeclaring themselves
invested with power to legislate for us, in -all cases whatsoever.
c He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his
protection, and waging war against us. ' ' - -. _-
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts,‘ burnt our towns,
and destroyed the lives of our people. « V
He»-is,.'at» this time, t'rans_porting large armies of foreign mer-
cenaries, to_ complete the work_s of death, desolation, and tyranny,
already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perﬁdy,‘s’carce1y
paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the
head of a civilized nation .7 . e ,
He has constrained ourfellow—citizens, taken captive on the
high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become th’e‘e‘xe—
-cutioners of their friends and bretlireii,-or to fall themselves‘ by

their hands. 

He has excited domestic insurre-ctions amongst us, and has en-
deavored to bring. on the =inhab,itants, of our frontiers, the. rne_rci-
less Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare isan undis-
tinguished destruction of all ages”,.f_ sexes, and conditions».

In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned for re-
dress, in the most humble terms: ,Our repeated petitions have
been answered only by repeated injury. 'A p.rince, whose ‘char-
acter is thus marked by every act. which may deﬁne a tyrant, is
unﬁt to be the ruler of a free people. . p 

Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren.
"We have warned them, from time to. time, of attempts, by their
legislature, to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction ove_r us. We
have reminded them of the circumstances of, our emigration and
settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and

magnanimity, and we have conjured them, by the ties.of our‘

common _kindre_d, to disavow these usurpations, which would
inevitably interrupt our connexions and correspondence._ ‘They
“too, have been deaf to the voice of justice and of .c'onsanguinity.

our separation, and holdthem, as we hold the rest of mankind,

We, therefore, the representatives of the UNITED STATES or-

22 INDIVIDUAL PROI‘ERTY.

of this system, laws are enacted to secure te
each individual the acquisition of his labor, skill,
and exertion; and a community is usually happy,
prosperous and civilized, in proportion as his acqui—
sitions are thus secure. *

On the contrary, a community is usually poor,
rude and uncivilized, in proportion as the acq_uisi~
tions of the people‘ are insecure; for if a person
knows that the fruits of his exertions may be taken

away by the government, or the privileged classes,  

or the powerful, he is discouraged, and will usually
make little effort to secure property beyond the
mere wants and necessities of life.

Such is the importance, therefore, of security of
property to individuals, that, in civilized countries,
by far the largest portion of the laws, and the
most important functions of government, have this
for their object and end. i

A right of a man to the property he acquires,
involves other rights, such as liberty to employ
his time, thoughts, and faculties as he;—J«;f_,pleases:

24 HUMAN RIGHTS.

be individuals so stupid, ignorant, or debased

as not to perceive, or but faintly, what justice
is, and not to appreciate the obligation of obeying
its dictates. But there is no nation at large among
Whom a sense of justice a perception of right, and
an obligation to follow it-—~does not exist, and
where it does not tend to guide or govern the
actions of men. ‘ 4 i

This intuitive perceptionof justice, with an at-
tendant conscience, demanding its observance,
though innate and natural, may be greatly Weak»-
ened or dulled by the usages, customs, and habits
of society. In proportion as the mind is enlight-
ened, this perception becomes clear and strong;
but the fullest exercise of justice, is ensured by
adopting the belief and practice of Christianity.

It seems to be a fact that no people have ‘ever
practically adopted justice as the basis of govern-
ment, and the guide of society, except in christian
countries. However man may be endowed with
the natural perception of justice, he seems to need
the ever-illuminating and purifying spirit of Chris-
tianity, to keep his mind clear and his heart right.

us to do to another as we would have another do
to us. It is rare indeed that, if an individual will
follow this rule, he will do injustice to any one.
But it is still necessary, in the formation of
government and the enacting of laws, to ascer-

tain what human rights are, lest they should be "

infringed or violated; and it is the duty of those
who frame laws, to see that these rights are, as far
as possible, secured.‘ '  

The general rig/zls -of man are life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness; that is, a man has
a right to his life, and the free exercise of his mind;

he has a right to his personal liberty, which is .

freedom to go where he pleases, and act as he
pleases; The- has a right to pursue happiness in his
ownway—-to eat, to drink, to sleep, to speak, read,

write, how and when he pleases——provided that, in  

in all this, he interferes withfthe rights of no other

person. These are the abstract or natural rights of ,

man’; and may be limited, or abridged, or taken
away, only for the epublicf good. a

The basis of human  is liberty; and
this consists in a man’ s iri'ght:‘ to himself--—to his
body, to his mind, and allhis faculties, with the
power of exercising them in his own way, so far
as he does not injure others. The value of liber-
ty, therefore, as a means of obtaining happiness, is
beyond price; and accordingly we ﬁnd that our
wise -forefathers fought, and bled, and died to
obtain it for themselves and their descendants.
Still, it will be seen hereafter, thatour natural
rights or our natural liberty, are abridged by_the
laws of society, and that a person is bound to; give

them up, as far as the greatest good of the greatest

number, requires.

Natural liberty.

If

LIBERTY is freedom from restraint. In its wid»
est sense, it is the free permission to exercise our
powers of body and mind as we please, without
hindrance or restraint. This is absolute libertg/.
According to this, a man might take away anoth-
er’s property or life; or enslaveanother man; or
make him the tool of his pleasures or caprices;
According to this, as strong man might use a weak
one as he pleased; or the cunning man might cheat
or circumvent another, and thus take away his
life or property, or make him the slave of his
pleasures. i   ‘

This is liberty without law. Such liberty as
this could exist only in theory, for where society
has enacted no law, the obligation of justice exists.

NATURAL LIBERTY. 27

A savage is as truly bound by the golden rule,

a“ do to another as you would have another do to

you,” as a member of civilized society; for eventhe
savage has a sense of right and wrong. Truth and
justice are intuitive perceptions and feelings, in
every human soul, and conscienceenforces their
observance. Every human being, therefore, has
his absolute liberty abridged, by notions of right
and Wrong, anterior to the formation of civil gov—
ernment.   y l i  
. Practically, absolute liberty Would. be the
harshest kind of tyranny, for it would immediately
result in making the weak, the slaves of the strong.
Not only would the weak, therefore, be‘ deprived
of liberty, but of justice, In this state of things,
no man is free, except the strongest man ; he alone
has power to act as he pleases, all therest are his
slaves: so that a coinniunity endeavoring to estab-
lish absolute liberty, imrnediatelyr make all the
members but one, the slaves of a master whose
might is the rule of right; p t  
,Absolute liberty, tthe1‘efé{i1‘e, as said before,
immediately runs into despotism. *lt_is a thing
that can only exist where one man, like ‘Alexander
Selkirk, or Robinson Crusoe, is alone uponlan;
island, and “monarch of all he surveys.” Absolute
liberty, in society, is a practical absurdity-—~an
impossibility. - ~ ~
Natural liberty is freedom from res,tra,int’_ ex-
cept so far as is imposed, by l.h6.‘,l3.,WS oft;-;nature..
According to this, a man may speak, ac_t,*jand
think, as he pleases, without control; in this, sense,
it is synonymous with absolute liber,ty§;_»'lBr,1it' it
is often applied to a state of society,, where‘ ~‘;1je~t-,
straints do actually exist; as,forins,tanCI3,:arnong_

$38 LIBER’1‘Y--=-ABSOLUTE LIBERTY ;

' savages, even Where property is held in common,

and tvhere of course there is no theft, there are
still obligations, rules, and restrictions, of   some
kind. a

The coward is punished with death; the par-
ricide is banished; the traitor is shot. Every
member of such a society is under certain re-«
straints, and certain abridgments of absolute
liberty. If one is guilty of cowardice, he consents
to lose his life; if he kills his parent, he consents
to be forever cast out of his tribe; if he betrays
his nation, he agrees that he shall be slain by an
arrow. Thus he is restrained from cowardice,
killing a father or mother, or betraying his coun-
try; all of which are abridgments of absolute
liberty. it

Thus, in the simplest and" rudest stages of
natural liberty, as put in practice among mankind,
we see certain restraints upon absolute liberty,

established by the laws or customs of the nation.

But, in point of fact, other restraints are put upon
the largest part of p the community; for in such a
state of society the weak are obliged, for the most
part, to bow to the strong. ‘If, indeed, the weak

are protected from the strong, then the strong are

restrained, and so far natural or absolute liberty, is
abridged. If it is not thus abridged, if the Weak
are not protected from the strong, then they are
the slaves of the strong. In this state of society,
Where natural liberty issaid to prevail, the mass
are «subject to the despotism of a few; the weak
are the slaves of the strong. A state of natural
liberty, is, therefore, practically, a state of tyranny
on the one hand and slavery on the other. .
An illustration of this is found among the

NATURAL LIBERTY. 29

animal tribes. Among the fowls of the barnyard,
there is no law: the males meet in conflict, and
the strongest or most active becomes the master.
Among a pack of - wolves, or among dogs, the
question who shall have the bone, is settled by
ﬁghting it out, and the strongest has it. The law
of nature, then, is a law of force: where there is
no other than natural law, might is the only rule
of right. *

Even if all men were virtuous, a state of natu-+
raland universal liberty could not eXist—-—for virtue
itself implies an observance of rules, obligations,
laws. A virtuous man will not steal; therefore, his
liberty in this respect, is restrained. It is restrained
by law; andthe only difference between this re-
straint and that of civil government, is, that God
enacts, and his own heart enforces, the law.

Civil government is founded in the idea that
men are not all virtuous; that men will not enact
and observe just laws individually and of them~
selves; and therefore, to secure order, peace and
justice, government must enact and enforce laws,
and thus abridge natural or absolute liberty.

Experience, in all ages, has taught the lesson,
that among men, as well as among animals, there
being some strong and some weak, the former will
ever seek to get the advantage of the latter.

Thus government steps in to protect the weak"

against the strong; to substitute justice for force,
right for might. ,      

CHAPTER X1.
Civil Liberty.

CIVIL liberty is freedom‘ to think and act as We
see ﬁt, except so far as the good of society may
require abridgment and restraint. A man has a
natural right to all he gains by his honest labor,
but in civilized society he consents to be taxed,
and thus part’ with a portion of his earnings-, to
sustain the government, on the ground that it is
best for the whole, and for himself among the
number, to have a government. A man has a
natural right to walk or ride where he pleases; but
in civilized society,.he _ consents to have his abso—
lute liberty so far abridged, as not to have a right
to ride or Walk in his neighbor’s garden or parlor,
or on the sidewalks of a city.

Thus, in a great variety of ways, a niember
of civilized society consents to have his absolute
liberty abridged; he consents to be obliged to serve
on juries; to be compelled to do military duty; to
forego the privilege of selling noxious drugs; of

dealing in gunpowder, except under license; he

consents to be obliged to buy his wood, ﬁsh, flour,
and various other articles, only when inspected.
He consents to all these restraints and priva-
tions, not because they are good in themselves,
but because society is beneﬁted, and he is himself

better off than he would be, if such restraints did

not exist. .. He gives up some of his natural rights,

some of his absolute liberty, for a greater good,

which is, security to the remainder of his rights.
This is the great principle on which civilized

CIVIL LIBERTY. 31

Society rests; it is the basis of all good and well
ordered government. All government is restraint
and abridgment of our natural and absolute liberty,
But government is necessary for the security of
our lives, our property, our houses, our families,
our characters. , Without a good, stable,‘and well

-ordered government, nine outof ten, being’ the

weaker, must be the slaves of the stronger. A
good government places the Weak and strong on

0 the same level; it sets up a standard of right, and

restrains that of might; it weighs everything in
the balance of justice, and does not decide ques-
tions by force or violence.

It is in order to secure justice, that men in
civilized society, give upcertain portions of their
absolute liberty, or absolute rights. They give up
a part to secure the remainder. Thus, if a man
has a property of 10,000 dollars, he consents to be
taxed ﬁfty dollars a year; and What he gets in

return for this, is the obligation of the government,

that he shall securely enjoy the remainder. With-
out this security, the strong man, or several men
combined, might come upon him, and by violence
take all his money away, and he could have no

remedy. But by paying fifty dollars a year he.
secures the enjoyment of the remaining 9,950 dol— '
liars. Thus he yields a part of his liberty or his i

right, to secure a greater and more important
good.  

In a civilized society, the‘ laws are numer-
ous, and as each law is an abridgmpent of some
portion of absolute liberty, it rnighteseem that all
liberty, would be taken away. Butstill, itappears
that all liberty, essential to happiness, is compatible
with a complete system of laws; and infect where

32 CIVIL LIBERTY.

the laws are just, and most completely carried into
effect, there is the greatest amount of practical
liberty. When a just law is transgressed, an
injury is done to the rights and liberties of at least
some member of society; where just laws are
most strictly observed, there is the greatest equal-
ity of rights, and the greatest amount of practical
liberty. L e

If you were to go among _the savage. tribes,

of New Holland, you would see that the lands,
dwellings, and most of the property are held in

common.,, You would see that each person seems

to go where he pleases, to‘ take what he pleases,
and to think and act as he pleases. You would
ﬁnd‘ among these people no book of statutes or
laws; you would find no court-houses, no jails,
none of that mighty machinery, which belongs to
the making and enforcing of lawsamong us. You
would perhaps be ready to say thathere is a peo-
ple in the enjoyment of absolute liberty, or if
indeed it be abridged, it is in a‘ very slight de~
gree. ' "

‘But examine a little closer. You see a sav~
age making a bow. He toils at it, day by day,
for a month. Nothing can exceed. the patience

and carewith which he selects a stick, shapes it

with a sharp stone, bends it so as to retain the
proper shape, and ﬁnally ﬁnishes it by covering
the end§s,with a coating of sinews. It has cost
him a 1iionth’s labor. And now for axquiver of
arrows -! Here is another long and tedious job. It
takes two or three days to make a good arrow,
with a savage’ s tools. After another month’s toil,
the quiver is ﬁnished. i , ,

Now, would you not say that this how and this

CIVIL LIBERTY. 33

quiver of arrows, were of right the property of this
savage who has made them? They are the pro-

duct of his toil, his ingenuity, his sacriﬁces. Com-

mon sense tells us thatrthey are his. That a man
is entitled to the productions of his own industry
and skill, is a point as clear and as natural, as that

‘twojand two make four. But, among savages, if

absolute liberty prevails, the ﬁrst Indian who sees
the bow and arrows made by another, may take
them away and appropriate them to his own use.
if he may not, then absolute liberty does not prew
Vail. If he is restrained by any rule, or custom, or

sense of justice, then there is a restraint upon iris

natural or absolute liberty.

But let us look a little further into -society.
One of the savages builds a hut, or wigwam. Is
it his, or not ‘.1 If absolutesliberty prevails, it is
his, for surely freedom implies a right to the free
enjoyment of what a man produces by his “toil.
But we see that all things are held in common
withgthese savages. Of course, thena man has
not a legal right to the possession and enjoyment
of what his labor creates. Here, then, at the out-
set, is a blow at the very foundation of liberty, for
what a man himself produces is taken away, and
made the property of society. The first principle
of such a society seems to be wholesale robbery. ,

Let us examine further. We shall see that,
in point of fact, even in this rude state of society,
there are Various rules, customs an ggopinioris,
which have the forceof law, and which do impose
restraints upon the actions of men. But we shall
notice one thing, that, as the lawsare few, imper-
fect,or ill administered; just in that prop,0r,tion.rour
life, property, hoguse, home, and char_acter are inse-

34 KLLUSTRATIONS

cure; and if these things are insecure-—-if life, the
property acquired by industry, the house, the
home, the ﬁreside, the Wife and children, domestic
comfort, character-eall that we love and cherish
andtoil for—--if these are liable to be taken away
by the strong or the violent, of what value is lib»
erty Cl Is there such a thing as liberty, where these
rights are insecure? \

Is not, society thus situated, subject to the
despotism of force"! and do we not see that in rude
and savage/tribes, Where at ﬁrst View awe might

L say there was most liberty, in point of fact, there
is the least liberty? And does not this prove that
the members of civilized society,‘ in giving up some
rights to secure the rest, do, in fact, enjoy more  

liberty than the tribes where the laws are few, and
Where liberty might seem least abridged’-Zr In

t short, does it not appear that a member of civilized
society makes a good bargain in giving up a few:

rights, by which he obtains security to life, prop~
erty, and character ‘.1 And does it not appear that
it is wise and right to submit to the laws of civil»
ized society?

illustrations, showing that Government pros
motes Practical Liberty.

MIN order to show that the amount of liberty actu~

  ally realized and enjoyed by society, is greater

where there is s a complete system of laws, than

rr.r.UsTrmT1oNs. L 35

where there is no law, or but little law, let us
suppose a few cases. i
In our own country, we have numerous laws.

Whenever any evil arises, er any great good is  

desired, the law-makers seek to avert the one and
secure the otherby legislation, if it is within their
proper reach. "The consequence is that almost
every transaction of life, is regulated by laws.
Now let us see if these, -which are restraints or
abridgments of theoretical liberty, do not actually
increase the amount cf practical liberty.

We have deﬁned civil _liberty to be freedom to
think and act as we see fit, having due regard to
the good of society. Now where would you
think or act most freely, in Massachusetts, or
among a savage tribe’! Here in Massachusetts, you
travel about in safety, for robbers are punished;
you sleep in security at night, for the thief and
house-breaker arepunished. You think as you
please, for no man dares to tyrannize ov-er another’s
thoughts. You can do what you please with
your time and your property, for he who would
interfere with these,is deemed a trespasser, and
punished by the law. a

Now suppose you were among the western In-.
dians, where natural libert.y prevails; where there
are no written laws, and few laws of any kind
which impose restraints upon scciety—should you
there enjoy more actual freedom than in tMassa.-
chusetts? On the contrary, would not your life be
in constant danger—-would not you be a slave to
fear? Could you travel about insafety “.1 Would}
not your property be exposed to robbers, your
person to captivity’! i - > e I ~

36 RECAPITULATION.

there are numerous laws, the people enjoy most
liberty? But let us look at particular statutes,
and see how these promote practical liberty.

There is a law that no man shall keep and sell

gunpowder, unless he is licensed. The object of
this is, to prevent quantities of gunpowder from
being in the hands of careless people, where it
might explode, and destroy lives and “ property.
Now as this law protects life and property, it pro»
motes liberty, which consists, to a great extent, in
the possession and security of these.

So the law which requires dealers in Wood, ﬁsh,
ﬂour, &c., to have these articles inspected before
they sell them, asit is clesigiied to prevent people
from being cheated, and Ui’lj1lStly deprived of their
property, tends to secure to a man his rights, ‘a.nd

therefore promotes civil and rational liberty.

Thus it appears that every law tending to make
life, property, character, and the pursuit of happi-—
ness secure to man, though it restrains absolute
liberty, actually increases the amount of practical
liberty enjoyed by society. Does not this show
that it is the interest as well as the duty of every

man to support good laws ‘.1

CHAPTER XIII.

A Recapitiilation.

FROM the preceding observations We deduce i

the following. propositions. 1. Liberty is freedom

from restraint. 2. Absolute liberty is freedom to

think, act and speak as We please, without him

RECAPITULATION5; 37

dra;ince'aor‘ control. . 3. Natural liberty is substan-
tially the same thing _as absolute liberty :* but such
kinds of liberty can only exist in theory, or where
one man lives alone, entirely cut off from all con-;
nection with his fellow-men; for, in the first
place, moral obligation to be just, to do to another
as we would have another do to us, rests upon all,
and is enforced by conscience, prior to the passage
of laws by society. , I

And in the second place, in rude or savage
society, where i there seenr to be the fewest laws,
and the nearestapproach to natural or absolute
liberty, there is, in fact, the least practical liberty,
and the most thorough despotism. The very ﬁrst
principle of liberty is grossly violated by the ele-
mentary law of savagesociety——a community of
property——which conﬁscates to the use of the whole,
what a man obtains or produces by his own
industry and skill. ,

In civilized society a man gives up some of
hisrights, or a portion of his liberty, to ensure the
free enjoyment of the rest: he paysa tax, for in-
stance, to suppcrt the government; in considera-5
tion of which, the government is bound to secure
to him the enjoyment of his life, his thoughts, his
property, his home, and his character.

Every law is a restraint and an abridgment
of absolute or natural liberty. A law against rnur-
der, imposes the restraint of i not killing a fellow-
man. Thus laws against stealing, wounding,
mairning, cheating, swindling, settingchouses on
fire, defaming a man’s character, breaking into a
house with intent to steal, robbing onthe highway,
or 7 the high seas——all these impose certain re-
straints on natural liberty. In these cases, the laws

38 ~ RECAPITULATION.

of society are founded on (_)l3VZlO11S principles oflmoe  

rality, and do butenjoin and enforce the obliga-
tions of justice, founded in every man’s con—
science. These laws are abstractly right, and it

is no evil or injustice to be compelled to observe

them. -

But the_ laws which compel a man to pay
taxes, to do military duty, to serve on juries, are,
abstractly considered, evils. A man has a natural
right to his money and his time, and the law
which takes a part of these away, takes aways-a
part of that which the moral law allows, and the
natural‘ law of liberty, gives. But in society, a
man surrenders a portion, of these, or,‘ in other

words, submits to one evil, in order to prevent as

greater evil, and at the same time to secure a good.
In a community Where the laws are fewest, and
most imperfectly enforced, there is the most injus-
tice, and the greatest abridgment of natural liberty,
in practice. There, life, property, and character
are the least secure, and there, human rights are
most violated. , a
Where the system of lawsis most complete and
"best enforced, there is the greatest practical liberty,
In other words, in society, where the laws greatly
abridge the natural liberty of the citizen, by clip-
ping off many of his lesser privileges, still, by ren-
dering him free to travel about in safety, to enjoy
his home and ﬁreside, and to keep secure posses—
sion of his property, to enjoy his fair character, to
enjoy freedom of conscience, and the free exercise
of his faculties, the law makes full compensation
for the sacriﬁces it requires. ,

EQUALITY. s 39

so far as the good of i society requires. A inembeii
of society can reasonably ask no other than civil
liberty; for, in the first place, the laws impose no
greater restraint upon him than upon others, and

in the second place, this kind of liberty is the only‘

kind that can be enjoyed by a whole community;

CHAPTER XIV.

Eqiiaiiigr.

As some persons have fancied that society ooulcl
‘realize a state of absolute liberty, so some have

fancied that astate of absolute equality could be

attained. It is said in our Declaration of Incl_epsen.-
dense, that “ all mankind are created equal;” and
this has often been taken as literally true.

But absolute equality is as impossible as absomi

40 EQUALITY.

lute liberty. In the first place, mankind are not born
-equal in respect to civil condition. Some, as the
serfs of Russia, are born slaves; in this country
too, in some of the states, certain individuals are
born to servitude, while others are born to enjoy
freedom. ‘

There are other grounds of inherent and neces«-
sary inequality. One person is born with a good
constitution; another is sickly from the cradle.
One person is endowed with a strong mind, an-
other with a weak one- One person is gifted with
beauty, another with deformity. One has natural
grace, another awkwardness.

The surface of the earth, thrown into‘ hills and
valleys, with mountains whose tops mingle with the
clouds, and ravines that never see the sunlight-—-
meadows that bloom with flowers, and deserts
that know no living thing—-plains and sloping
hills, covered with forests——~and ‘rocky regions
where no tree can root itself-—all this diversity of
nature presents not more inequality than the
conditions in which mankind are born. The
whole‘ system of nature and providence, shows
it to be the design of the Creator and moral gov»-
ernor, that there shall be diversityin human society,
as well as in nature. a

Beside, even in those countries where there is
the greatest freedom, and the nearest" approach
to equality in society, even there, mankind are nei-
ther born free nor equal, in the view of the law.

lf we take no account of slaves, still the children s

of white persons are not born free ;' they are under

the control of their parents till they are twenty—one-

years old. .
Females, who constitute a part of mankind,

EQUALITY. 41.

and whose natural rights are the same as those of
men, are never placed’ on an equality with men
before the law. They are never permitted, even
in forming .the constitution of a country, nor in

‘enacting the laws, nor in choosing rulers, to use the

right of voting. They are excluded from all share
in the government, by the stronger sex, who pro»
ceed to make such laws as they please; and in all
countries these laws exclude women from political
power. ' I

It appears, therefore, that mankind are not «born
free and equal, in a literal sense. In what sense,
then, can it be truly said that men are created
equal’! Only "as meaning that all the members of
society are born with a just claim to civil liberty——-

to that freedom which is compatible with the gen?

eraligood, and to an equality of rights. It means
to say that those laws which make one man a lord
and another a serf———which make one a citizen and
debar another in the same condition, from the right
of »voting—-—are violations of the principles of jus-
tice and the rights of man.  
While, therefore, equality of condition is out of
thequestion, one thing is plain,——that equal rights,
equal laws, and an equal administration of these
laws-——-so that the rich and the poor, the high and
the lowly, the citizen and the office-holder, shall
all stand on the same footing———are the ends and
designs of a good government; and every per-
son should so use his power as to establish such
ends and designs. Equality does not mean that a
woman shall be equal to—a man, or a child the same

as a man; but that all women, all children, all

citizens, shall enjoy the same relative rights, priv-
ileges, and immunities.

CHAPTER XV.

Civil Government.

Civil govemmem,‘ is that system of laws, wheth-»
er written or printed, or transmitted by custom,
which is established to secure and promote justice
and order. VVithout government, society would
be in a state of anarchy. In a family, govern-
ment is necessary; it is also necessary even in a
sch0o1—room. Withotit civil government, the rights
of man would not be respected; ‘life and property
would not be safe. In such a state of things, rob-~
bery, plunder, and murder would be the common
occurrences of A, life. No attempt to obtain peace
and order without government, has ever succeeded.
Men are not virtuous, as a mass, and therefore the
power of governnienjt and the force of law are
required. ‘ L c

CIVIL GOVERNMENT. 43

Thus, as before remarked, in all societies, gov««-
ernment of some kind, becomes a matter of neces»
sity; and all government may be considered as

giving up some portion of our liberty and our

rights, to secure the remainder.

In a society Where the people possess absolute
liberty, the many are rendered immediately the
slaves of the few; the weal: are subjected to the
strong; despotism is ever ready to take possession
of a community, contending for absolute liberty.
It is indispensable for the security of order, justice,

peace and happiness, that society should form a ,

government, and submit to the restraints it im-
poses. No other mode has yet been found, by

‘which the whole community can enjoy even a mod-—

erate degree. of liberty andhappiness.

A man who expects to enjoy liberty Without
paying for ‘it, ivitliout surrendering a portion to
secure the rest,» judges and acts as foolishly,as one

_Who wishes to rear a crop of Indian corn, but yet

is too stingy to furnish the seed. to plant.

A member of society, in giving up a part of his *

liberty to secure the rest, acts on the principle of

i insurance, in which a man gives ﬁve or ten dollars

to have his house or property insured against fire,
for one year. Government is a kind of mutual
insurance against robbery, plunder, murder, and

injustice. Government has been compared to a .

partnership, in which all have shares, each one
participating in the proﬁt and loss of the concern.
The great problem’ of government is to ﬁnd out

the utmost enjoyment of liberty, compatible with ‘
the good of society. Every lavv -should be consid-{ '
ered in two points of View : ﬁrst, how‘ far it
abridges natural liberty, and how far, therefore, it A

is an evil, and secondly, the good it will do by

prevention of evil, or by the direct procurement of *

benefit to society. Every act of legislation should
be tested in this way; and _no act should be
passed, Which, after such an examination, does not
promise a balance of good. .

a Government is sometimes spoken of as a social
compact‘-—~—a11 agreement between all the members
of community. - This is rather a deﬁnition of
What government should be, than what it is. in
the United States, where the people make the
government, it may be called a social compact or
agreement between the members of the commu-
nity; but in Russia, Where the people at large
have nothing to do with making the government,
it can hardly bear this designation. The govern-
ment is there forced upon the people, and estab-
lished without their co—operation. t

It may be i-ndeed said that submission implies
assent, and that this submissionmakes the people
parties to the social compact or agreement; but We
know that in many cases, this assent is extorted
by military power, or other circumstances "Which
control the freedom of the citizens. There can be,
strictly speaking, no compact which is not freely
entered into by all parties; any government,’
therefore, which is founded in force, which has
not the free sanction of the people at large, is not
a social compact. The origin and binding force of *
government will be hereafter discussed.

Government. continued.

Govnamvrsnr, it will be understood, embraces
three distinct things: 1st. The system or form of
government‘, usuallyfonnded upon some constitn~
tion, either written or sanctioned by the people, ‘or
established by usage ; 2d. The srcrzules and laws ,~

3d. The admim'sz7'a:z‘2‘m2, consisting of the oiﬁcers,‘

appointed to see thatthe laws are obeyed, andthe
action of the government sustained. T
The system or form of government of the Uni»-
ted States, is prescribed in a ‘written constitution,
sanctioned by the people.‘ The statutes are the laws
enacted by congress, agreeably to this constitution.
The administration consists of the president of

-the United States, his secretaries, éce; r

The system or form of government of Massa.~
ohnsetts,- or New York, or Ohio, or any other of
the separate United States, is also prescribed by a

written constitution, sanctioned by the people of i

the state. - The statutes consist of the laws passed
by the state legislatures, and the administration
consists of the governor and his irnrnediate ofiicers.
No law is binding that violates a constittrtion,
for the makers of the laws   have authority to act
only by that instrument. « T  y . j ' 
p In Great Britain, the form of goveinrnent is
prescribed and sanctioned by usage, and not by any
particular Written document. The laws are the
statutes enacted by parliament and signed by the
king; the administration consists of the "king and
his ministers. In France, there is a writtenc?on~

PREFACE.

IN a country where government derives its very exist-
ence from the people, and Where its entire administration
is dependent on them, it is clear that it will be good *0!)
bad, as the people are intelligent or ignorant, virtuous or
vicious. We cannot. gather grapes of thorns, or ﬁgs of

thistles; We cannot. expect a wise government from J

ignorance, or a pureﬂone from corruption”. Hence, the
familiar remark, that the safety of our liberty----of our

republican institutions", lies in the intelligence and virtue:

of the people. .

The difftisioii of moral and intellectual light is there’-

fore the great Work of the patriot in these ‘United States.
And while this is true, as ageneral remar‘k, it should
not be forgotten that there is special‘ reason for the
diffusion of political truth._ Government is‘! an artiﬁcial

structure, vast in its dimensions, curious and compli- .
cated in its parts. A. man can nomore heborn a gov-'

and the king with his ministers are the adminis»
tration. Many of the systems of Europe are sim-
ilar to that of France, while others are despotic.

There is another division, belonging to the
governments of most civilized countries, which
distributes the powers of the rulers into three
branches: 1st, the legislative, or law-making
power: 2d, the judicial, or judging power; and
3d, the executive power.

The House of Representatives at

THE legislative power is usually vested in a
certain number of persons chosen by the people,
or a portion of the people, for that purpose. These

on THE LEGISLATURE. 47

are commonly divided into two branches, called

the upper and lower house. i
These two bodies of men usuallvassemble in
two different; rooms in the same building, and
discuss various acts, resolutions, and laws. When
a law is introduced into either house, it is called a
bill. It/is read by the speaker’ or president of the
house, and after being sufficiently discussed, the
speaker or president puts it to vote; that is, he

calls upon the members in favor of, it to say ay,

and those opposed, to say no.

If there are more ayes than noes, the bill passes;
if not, it is lost. The bill being passed, is sent
to the other house. It is there discussed, and voted
upon. - If it passes, it goes to the governor or pres-

ident, or king, and if he signsit, it becomes a

law. a

This is the usual mode of ‘making laws, or of
legislation, in civilized countries. In savage or
barbarous countries, Where there are no Written
laws, of course thereis no legislature; all "power,
legislative, judicial or executive, being absorbed

by the king, or chief, and ‘his immediate oﬂicers
and dependents. Where such a state of things ‘

exists, the people have nothing to do in making

the government. All they are required to do is to

submit.

man has actually broken the law, as charged.-

Their decision is called a verdict, and is either
guilty or not guilty. . x

If it is not guilty, the man is acquitted and
released. If it is guilty, then the judge proceeds
to pronounce the penalty of the law, and this is
called the sentence. If the sentence is death, the
man is executed by the sheriff; if thesentence is
iinprisoninent, he is shut up in the jail; if the
sentence is a ﬁne, he is required to pay the
money.

CHAPTER 
The Executive Power.

THE e:t'ecuzév;e power is placed-in the head of
the governnient, whose duty it is to see to the,.exe~
cution of the laws. In Massachusetts, New York,
Ohio, and each of the UnitedStates, the executive
power of each state is chieﬂy vested in a governor.

rThe executive power of the United States is
vested in a president, who appoints various sec1'e~
taries to assist him, and these r are called the cab:
inert. In England, the executive power is inthe
king, who appoints various agents called ministers,
and these exercise the executive power in the
name of the king. r e f   _“

to appoint various oﬂicers necessary for this pur-
ose; to see that the acts of Congress are observed
and fulﬁlled; and if necessary to enforce the laws

passed by Congress ; to see that the navy is taken

care of; to see that the army is provided for and
properly employed; to see that the public property
is secure; to see to the general interests of the coun-
try, so far as the laws placethem under his care.

Thus the president carries on, or administers, the
government; and therefore we call him, with his
advisers and assistants-—the cabinet.—-«the adminis-
tration. We also sometimes call the acts of a
president, his administration. Accordingly, we
speak of Washington’s administration, .l'efi"erson’s
administration, &c. i

The duty of a governor of a state, is to see that
the state laws are executed, and that the acts of the

state legislature are fulﬁlled. He appoints various  

oﬂicers to assist in administering or carrying on
the government, and he has a general charge
over the public interests of the people. He is the

' commander—in-chief of the state militia, and may

call upon them to aid in executing the laws, in
suppressing insurrection, or repelling invasion.
Let it be remembered, then, that the legislature

makes the laws; the judiciary, consisting of the
courts, interprets, and applies them; and the exec-c

rmive executes or fulﬁls them. These , are the

three great powers of government; and wherever

government exists, these must exist. ’ a

These powers ought always to be placed in difv
ferent hands, and to be‘ independentaof each other;
for if the same person may make the laws, inter—
pret and apply them, and at last execute them;
then it will be seen that the powers of government

are so vested, that they may be used according to

the interest, passions, or caprices of the ruler.
Such is a government of man, and not a govern-
ment of laws.

To illustrate this, suppose the president of the

United States may pass} a law; suppose he may

also interpret tliat law, and at last suppose he
may put it in force———it isrobvious that if he can
do all this, he is a despot,‘ for his power is unlim-
ited; and there is no diiference, in spirit, between
our government, in thisycase, and that of Russia,
Spain, or Turkey. If one man does, either directly
or indirectly, engross the three powers of govern-
ment, he is a despot; and exactly in proportion
as a ruler acquires and exercises either legislative’
or judicial powers, he is despotic. ' »
' In despotic countries, the three powers of gov-
ernment are usually placed in the hands of the

emperor, king, or chief. The sultan of 

for instance, makes the laws, has them interpreted’
as he chooses, and has them executed as he

‘chooses. Such is a government. of snian, andnlot a

there are Wandering tribes who have numerous

their chief subsistence being derived from their

Among these people, some aged Aman, of a great
experience‘ and Worth, is usually the chief. He
is called the pairiarc/3; which means the father of
his people; and this idea furnishes the basis of his
government ; for he is expected to rule over the
tribe, as a father would govern his family. This
patriarchal form of governmentis of greatantiquity,
for Abraham was the chief of a pastoral tribe, and
was its patriarch. L _' ,

person, and becomes a dictator. This is the gov-»
ernment of a military c/zieftain.

When society becomes more advanced, and men
live in cities, the military Chieftain usually builds
himself a palace, and becomes a king. He Wishes
to strengthen and establish the throne ; so he
claims to reign by the appointment of God; and,

in order to make a strong impression upon the

people, he lives in great state, affects to be the
favorite of heaven, and maintains that his per-
son should be held sacred. He causes loyalty,
which is love of theperson and government of the
king, to be taught as a noble sentiment, and a
duty, not inferior to that of the love of God.

. Such a king, in order to strengthen hisgovem-
ment, and perpetuate his tdynlasty, usually takes
care to provide that his oldest son, or his heir,
shall be his successor; and thus makes the crown

hereditarym-that is, descending from father to
son, &c.

Another cunning artiﬁce of kings, is to get the
p1'iests,;,and ministers of religion, as far as he can,
to teach, advise, and command the peopleito obey
the king, and hold his person, government, and

laws, sacred and inviolable. , To attach the people

to his interests, he usually establishes a state re-
ligion, and requires the people to conform to it.
This is supported by the government, and provi-
sion is made, by the state, for the priests, so as to

:.eI‘iS.u1’e their ﬁdelity to the king.

This connection of the government with religion,

for the sake of establishing despotic power over the

people, is called the tmrio-2'2 0 f c/zurc/2, and .5-zfate. It is
carefully provided against in our political systems;

VVhen a king is active and ambitious, he usually
carries on wars with other countries, thereby seek-
ing to extend-his power, to increase his Wealth,
and glorify his name. If he is successful,‘ he
comes at length to unite several countries under

one monarch, Wl1lCl1,.tlf1L1S united, are called an

empire. ,The king, under such circumstances,
reigning over an empire, 1S usually called i an em-

peror. Thus the monarchs of Russia and of

China are called emperors, for their dominions
include various countries. ' *

These are some of the simplest forms of gov-

ernment, and in former times, unlimited power

was placed in the hands of the patriarch, military,
chief, king, or emperor. They were therefore,

and some still are, mere despozisms. t

whole ediﬁce of government. Should not every man to
whom such a mighty trust isconﬁded, know what he is
about ?

These are obvious truths, yet they appear not to be
duly borne in mind. There are some politicians who
seem averse to popular-education, as if the policy of de-
spotic priests and princes, which Would keep the mass
ignorant, so that they may easily be kept in subjection,

still lingered in their minds. There are others who

have a disgust of politics, as if there Were something
revolting in the duties and ofﬁces which result in giving

gsecurity to life and property and home! Surely,_we

they will exercise for good or ill to themselves and
their country?” , _

-It is from reﬂections like 1-these that I have been
induced to undertake this little book, the purpose of
which is to make the nature, origin, and principles of
government, and especially of our own, accessible to all,
and if possible, familiar to our youth. I have written it
for a home book, and a school book, hoping that, until a
better is furnished, it may be deemed worthy of intro-

oﬂices and functions of government. a
- There never has been, in point of fact, a pure
democracy; for, even in ancient Attica, Where there
was the nearest ‘approach to it, among a popula»
tion of 400,000 souls, there were but about 20,000
citizens who had _a‘ right. to take part in govern-
ment ; and but few, of these actually concerned
themselves with it. In our country, though in
form the government is not a democracy, the peo-
ple, at large have more inﬂuence; for'here, one
sixth of the Whole population are voters.

A republic is a government in which the people
have established a constitution, and in which they
choose some of their f€llOW'»-Cl’tlZ€3I1S to make and
administer laws. Each of the United States is
therefore a republic.   The government of the
United States is formed upon an union or confed-
eration of the several states, and is therefore called
a federal republic. Texas, Mexico, Gautimala»,
and several South American countries, have adopt-
ed republican governments.

The distinction between a democracy and a
republic is, that in the former, the people act
themselves, directly, in the business of goverr-1~
ment; in a republic, the people choose men to
represent them and act for them. in a democracy,

«there is no binding and controlling constitution,
‘for the people are supreme; in a republic, the peo-
'ple prescribe a constitution, and elect men to act

under it. A republic is therefore sometimes called
a constitutional, and also a representative govern-
ment.

An ’a.rz'sz‘ocmc_7/ is a government in which the

arclzy is the government of. an hereditary king or  

emperor. Most of the governments of Europe are
mixed, and partake of several of these forms. I

shall have occasion hereafter, in the history of_

governments, to notice some of these.
  There are several terms used in characterizing
government, which it is important to understand.
A despotic government is one in which power has
no check; a tyrannical government is one in
which government is exercised arbitrarily, and
against law and justice; a free governmentis one
in which the liberty of the citizen is protected,
and the rights of man secured. ' .
An aristocratic government is one in which a
few distinguished persons have a leading or con,»
trolling inﬂuence; in this sense, the government

of Great Britain is an aristocratic government,

though the form is monarchical. A democratic“

government is one in which the people have a con-
trolling inﬂuence. In this sense, ours is a demo-
.cratz'c government, though the form is republican.
The greatest distinctions in government arise
from the different parties in whose hands power is
placed. Ina democracy, it is directly in the hands
of the people; in a republic, it is indirectly in their
hands, though they depute it to others. Those gov».
ernments in which the inﬂuence of the people pre~
ponderates, arecalled popular ; those in which the
people have little or no influence are despotic;

THE necessity of Grovernment must have been
discovered in the first human family. If a child
is not restrained, he will run into the fire, leap out
of the window, break the furniture, injure his com»
panions, or set the house on fire; he must
therefore be governed. The larger children must

be prevented from striking and wounding the
younger ones; from taking away their food, doc.

These too must be governed.
‘Without government, a family would be in a

" state of confusion and anarchy; its necessity there~

fore must have been discovered by Adam and Eve.
The first government must consequently have been
family government, and this doubtless suggested

the patriarchal form, which must have soon fol-—
lowed. VVhen Adam became a great grandfather,
with numerous descendants around him, he was
likely to have an authority founded in reverence
and affection, and this Woul_d lead him to be re-
garded, and applied to by the people, as a judge, a
counsellor, and, in short, a ruler. . Probably Adam
was the first patriarch, a.nd the first politica.l
chief. as . .

in the first ages of the World, the people were
chieﬂy husbandmen, as they had ﬂocks, with Which
they wandered from place to place. As each party
separated from the rest, they were likely to take
some experienced man with them, who would be
their patriarch. ~ ‘A

‘When the tribes increased and exteiided their
limits, and the ties of blood were forgotten, they

i were likely to meet and contend for the mastery.

In these struggles, the strong, the daring, or the
skilful Warrior was likely to become the leader,
and at length to receive or usurp authority. It is
probable that Nimrod, the mighty hunter, was one
of those who became the head of his tribe, and, at
length, laid the foundations of Babylon.

He Was, doubtless, a very ambitious ‘man, and
extended his domain over various countries on and
around the plain of Shinar. He thus established
an empire and became a despotic sovereign. In
order to increase his authority, and to place his
throne on a strong basis, he taught the people to
consider him as ruling by divine right, and at last
claimed their worship of himself as a divinity.
He also, no doubt, made the monarchy heredi-
tary in his family. i

The example of Nimrod seems to have been

followed by all the sovereigns of Assyria, during
its continuance of 1700 years. The power of the
emperor or. king was always absolute, and his
claim to divine authority‘ was ever maintained.
No instance is recorded in which the right of the

sovereign to reign was questioned, nor are we tcld.

ever conceived the idea that the people had any

right to govern themselves.’ Even when. the gev—

ernrnent was just, and consulted the happiness

the sovereign. - ‘ ~ V ” ‘  
The despotic system of this first empire appears to
have been followed throughout the rest of Asia, and
to some extent in Egypt 5 and we observe no traces

- of any other ideas of government than that of un-

limited power in the hands of a king or chief er

the priests, except among the Hebrews. Persia,

a vast’ empire, that _rose_ upon the ruins of the
Assyrian empire, adopted the same despotic form.
of government, and the emperor ruled in the same
arbitrary manner. He had unlimited power over

’ the people. If the king was supposed to bejbolrnd

to govern wisely and righteously, his people were
equally bound to serve him as subjects and slaves.

CHAPTER XXII.

Political System of the Hebrews.

THE government of the Hebrews has been
zalled a t/zeocmciz , which means a form of govern-
:nent which assigns all the power to God; he
aeing, in fact, the proper king. In the first place,
‘his’ government was under Moses, the legislator;
:hen under Joshua, his successor; then under
udges, and then under kings and high—priests. In

ill these cases, God was acknowledged to be the

rue king of the nati‘on———butgit was only under
Vlosesthathe was regarded as dW‘elli‘I'1‘g,‘- person-p

ally, among the people. Afterwards he was con-
sidered as ruling through the judges or kings, who
were to look to him for advice or counsel, and who
were to be appointed by him. ‘

‘When David became king, God ordained that

the monarchy should be hereditary in his family‘.

His successors practically altered the government,
and, instead of acknowledging God as king, they
seemed to throw off his authority, and to rule
accordingto their own will. ' g
' They would not submit to the restraints which
had been observed by former rulers, and VVl1lCl".
operated like a constitution to limit the power of
the kings,and to protectthe people. They there-
fore notonly fell into idolatry, but they werc
guilty of cruelty and oppression. ,The country
was accordingly subject to great miseries, and a‘
last the nation was scattered. '
In whatever point of view we regard the lie‘
brew system of laws, as established by Moses

they are most remarkable. This people had lived

for several centuries in Egypt, where therewas ar
universal belief in many gods, and where idolatr3
was the universal practice of the people. The

A government, too, was despotic, placing absolute

power in the hands of the kings and priests. i
,Yet, immediately on leaving Egypt, we ﬁnd the
people receiving from Moses a creed, both civil and
religious, entirely distinct from that of the Egyp
tians, and unlike any other which had ever existed
It must be recollected that Moses lived’ about 150(

V years before Christ, which was a thousand year:

before Confucius, the lawgiver of China, and 80(
before Solon, the Grecian lawgiver.
The great idea of the Mosaic institutions We:

the existence of one Grod—--as distinguished from
the creed of many gods, which prevailed at that
time in all other nations-—~with the doctrine that
the people were responsible to him for every

action. In order to inculcate these principles and

eradicate all the idolatrous notions which the He-
brews had imbibed in Egypt, Moses instituted a

great variety of rites and ceremonies, all calcu-

lated to produce these effects, and, at the same time,
to keep the descendants of J acobas a distinct and
peculiar people. '

Such being his leading design, nothing could be
better conceived than the means he adopted for
his purpose. To superintend the religious rites
and ceremonies, priests, being the descendants of
Aaron, were appointed, and numerous assistants,
called Levites, from Levi, their progenitor, were
also appointed. These latter obeyed the priests
inthe services“ of the temple, and sang and played
on instruments in the daily services. They also
studied the law, and were the common judges,
being however inferior to the priests, who were
1iot,only judges of religious questi.ons, but of civil
and criminal cases.

There is no part of government more important
than that of the administration. of justice, by
which is meant the settlement of questions arising
under the laws. Under the patriarchs, the

judicial power was invested in the heads.-of tribes A

or families, who could banish, sdisinherit, or inflict
sentence of death, according to their own \Vlll.
In the time of Moses, :3. change was made in this

respect; he was made ;si’1pre1ne judge, and subse-—.

quently the priests had’ i jurisdiction. There were
also courts established, to which authority was

given over thousands, hundreds, ﬁfties, and tens,
These courts were again changed at several sub-
sequent periods.   . i

Before the courts, a man could plead his own
cause, though inenof Wisdom and inﬂuence seem
to have appeared in behalf of those incapable
of speaking for themselves. In criminal cases the

person charged was exhorted first to tell the truth,
and then the witnesses were put under oath.

'Witnesses were examined separately,but in pres-
ence of the accused- “When a man was found
guilty of a crime, he was immediately hurried
away to execution.   " ,  

Though the institutions of the‘ Hebrews were
essentially diﬂ:’erent from those which prevail in
this more enlightened day, still it must be admitted
that they were far more favorable to individual
liberty than the institutions of other countries of
that age, and moreiso indeed than those of the
priiicipal monarchies of Asia now existing; The
administration of justice, in the time of David,
among the, Hebrews, was more consonant to
humandrights, thap. it is now in China, the most

THE early history of China is involved in the
mists of obscurity. The historians of the country
claim an incredible antiquity, and pretend to
tell us of dynasties that reigned over the nation
for ages before the period assigned to the creation
of the world. i t

It is now, and has been for ages, _the policy of
the government to exclude strangers fromi the

the nature and history of that government Which our
fathers founded, and which gives protection to the
people, and looks to the people for support. “That

set the seal of darkness, of ignorance, upon the minds
of children, in respect to this great subject, either by
withholding or interdicting the means of light, in those
institutions, Where alone most of them can obtain it?
There is another point of great importance to be con»
sidered. The conviction is very general, that, by some
means or other, 'm0'ralz'ty and politics are in a state of
dz'vo7'ce among a large portion of our political leaders.

The monstrous doctrine that “all is fair in politics ” is ‘
«supposed extensively to prevail; and most of the proﬂi-

gacy We observe, most of the corruption, intrigue, self-
ishness, and destitution of patriotism, so notorious in
high places, are imputed to the currency of this false and
wicked philosophy. Ought not something to be done,
especially, to stay these mighty evils; something to teach
the truth, that honesty. is the best policy in govern-
ment, as well as everything else——a concern in which we
are all partners? . Shall a few of the partners be ‘per-
mitted to swindle all the rest out of their share of the
proﬁts, and nothing he done, but to fold the hands -in
imbecile submission?  ‘ ’

If something need be done,’ to remedy this -great
evil, how can it be better done thangb_y beginning in that

scale of which there is any account, for his family
consists of about 360 millions of members. Be-~
side, the nature of the government is rather too
severe for a parent to administer to his children.

The emperor is absolute in his authority, and
such,is the extertt of his dominions that he is
obliged totdevote his whole timefto business. 011
ferings are made to his image and his throne; his
person is worshipped, his subjects prostrating them»-
selves before him. He never appears in public
without two thousand lictors, bearing. chains,
axes, and ether instruments indicative of eastern
despotism. _ . i ’  , i

There are -two kinds of nobility; those who
have titles and privileges by birth, and thosewho
hold oﬂices; these are called mandarins. in every
province there is a mandarin, or magistrate, who
is aided by a council. There are courts of justice
in the differenttowns, but these are too often
capricious and corrupt.f In order to ascertain
whether a witness tellsthe truth, his spittle is

examined. If he “spits ‘c0z't07t,” that is, if the

mucus isfrothy, it is esteemed a proof’ of agitation
of mind incompatible with honesty, and he is dis»
credited. t

On the whole, the government. of China is the
best in Asia, but it is the most‘ despotic in the
world. "All power being?-ivith' the emperor, the.
people are not considered as having any political

It has been humorously said that the -emperor
canes his ministers; the ministers cane the man-
darins; and the mandarins cane the people; the

men cane their Wives; and the wives cane their

ered a Well-ﬂogged nation.

The art of printing was known in China, even
hefore its discovery in Europe, and now nearly all.
persons can read. The laws are published, and it
is made the imperious duty of all magistrates

(‘thoroughly to under:st.ar1d them. The penal code, is

called“ Ta Tsing Len Lee,’,’ has been published
in the English language. '
From this code, which has been gradually‘

forming under a succession of emperors for ages, .

it appears that the laws of China are a series of
police regulations, many of them such as could
not be established or enforced either in Europe or
this country. . t -
The punishments inflicted by this code, are
chieﬂy whipping with a bamboo cane; wearing
around the body a heavy frame of Wood called the
cang-ue, and which is a moving pillory; banish-

ment, imprisonment, strangulation, and decapita-it

give some idea of it : T .

ated, are among the mightiest works of human

labor. . . I
Among the ruinsof Thebes, and other cities
along the banks of the Nile, there are the most
wonderful architectural remains. .Cut in the
rocks, there are chambers or rooms still existing,
the Walls of awhich are ornamented with curious
paintings. 7 by I -

Some of these represent the manners an_d cus-
toms of the ancient inhabitants of these cities, and
Sl1OW that a greatvariety of utensils now in use,
and supposed to be of modern origin, were Well
known to the Egyptians, thousands of years ago.

It is evident. that Egypt, at a date going back
nearly 2000 years before Christ, was a thickly
peopled country, and that a Vast Variety of curious
and usefullarts were in use among the inhabitants.
There" is no doubt that it was, at this and later
dates, the most civilized portion of the globe, and
that it wasthe school at which: other nations for
many ages learnt philosophy. I From this country
it was that the Greeks, who became so celebrated

for their arts and their advances in every species

of human learning, derived their ﬁrst light in all
branches of human knowledge. V e

But however much Egypt may have done for
the rest of the World in those remote and mystic
ages,‘ we have not a Very minute record of her
internal history. Of her political system, we know

thatit was an hereditary and despotic monarchy,
modelled upon the Asiatic plan, but greatly modi-y’
ﬂed, at least in early times, by the inﬂuence of“

priests.

POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS or EGYPT. 71

‘ A. There is no nation of antiquity in which religion

seems to have had greater inﬂuence, than in Egypt.
Though they had advanced far in many arts and
sciences—-———though they knew the globular form of
the earth, calculatedeclipses, regarded the moon.
as another globe, were acquainted with arithmetic,
geometry, and various curious arts, now lost-—‘-
still they were in the highest degree supersti-
tious. ' i_ i L   I

Their superstitions were or "the most gloomy
kind. Miisicxyaso only used at funerals and the
Worship of the gods. Pleasure was a stranger to
the Egyptians ; songs, dances, and sports, they dis-
liked; ’ they never used Wine; their drink was
beer, made of barley. Funerals and times of sad-
ness were the only occasions of parade and
expense.‘

Justice was adniinistered in a strict and speedy
manner. ‘Written laws existed, and were handed.
down from age to‘ age. Perjury and murder were
punished with death. Calumniators and false
accusers, ‘were punished as if they had committed
the crimes they charged on others. Falsehood
was punished by a loss of the tongue; forgery, by
loss of the hand; desertion of the army, by in-
famy.

The king could remit the penalty of the law,
and indeed his authority was rega_rdedas supreme
-«but in point of fact, he was himself, in many
things, overruled by the priests. These even made‘
rules to regulate his private affairs; they educated
his children; pointed out the daily duties of his
slaves; fixed the bill of fare at his table; andiin

Various ways abridged and controlled his 'power.-’’;4

demned, their bodies were cast away. Soldiers

andpriests were exempt from all taxes, and every’.

son. was obliged to follow the profession of his
father. The people were divided into sever: casts--
priests, soldiers, shepherds, swineherds, mecha11—
ics, interpreters, and ﬁshermen. The priests were
at the head 3* they were the teachers of the people
and the patrons of science. From them the chief

offices of state were ﬁlled; theylwere the physi~»

clans, judges, architects, astroriomers and astrolo-

gers... They kept science and knowledge to them--

selves, for by these they held their sway over the
people. i L -

Thus 1t appears that the govert1merxt,of ancient
Egypt was despotic, checked only by the power
the priests, and laws established ‘by usage. lt
appears, also, that this power Varied at different
periods, being more despotic at one time than arr-

other. It does r1ot"seem, however, that any other

idea of government was ever started, than that of
a divine . right to rule on the part of L the prince,
or the priest, and the same obligation to obey on
the side of the people. '

IT is at a period of Very distant antiquity, and.
in an age involved in doubt and fable, that the

-history of Greece begins. It was about ﬁve hun-

dred years after the ﬂood, when Abraham was
living, that is, about 3700 years ago, that the ﬁrst
kingdom of Greece was founded; the country, pre-
vious to that time, being inhabited by Wild and
Wandering tribes of . savages.

The history of ancient Greece commences in the

year 1856, B. C., and ends in 146, B. 0., making

a space of 1700 years, being nearly one third of
the time that has elapsed since the World .Was

74 ANCIENT GREECE---CHARACTER OF THE PEOPLE.

created, and almost one half of‘ the time since
the deluge. ‘

T The country of ancient Greece was a large
peninsula in Europe, on the north side of the Med-
iterranean sea, lying‘ between Italy and Asia

l Minor, and embraced many islands situated near

its shores. lts length, when most ’eXtensiVe, was
about 400 miles, audits breadthabout an average
of«15U miles. " V c \
Yet this small spot, less in extent than the
State of New York, produced a_ people, who left

,more to instruct and admonish the nations that

followed them than any other; and who, after
the lapse of 2500 years, are st~i.ll the subjects of the
most lively interest.  t

The country]. inhabited by this extraordinary
people was highly beautiful. its surface was
Vari.egated by picturesque mountains; between
them were valleys . of the brightest Verdure,
through which a thousand small, but clearrivers
dashed rapidly to the sea. — . i T 

The climate was among the finest in Europe.
It was exempt from the extremes of summer and
winter; the sky was seldom obscured ; and the air,
being peculiarly clear, presented objects to the eye
with the most striking distinctness. The sea was
said to be more beautiful, the islands that clustered
around the peninsula more charming, the roman-

tic landscapes, embracing mountains, and Vales,

and rivers, more delightful here than in other
lands.

It was the lot of a people of strong and peculiar

genius to inhabit this favored region. Here they
ﬂourished for 1700 ears. This ancient nation

deeds and their institutions have survived the
lapse of ages; and like mountains seen through
the mist of distance, they ‘strilrethrough the shad-
ows of antiquity, and still excite our Wonder and
admiration.   « ’ i t

It is to this people that we are indebted for the
first example of a federal government——~—a union of
several states under one superintending power.
Of course, we ﬁnd in its history the first outline

of the constitution of our own government, so

much the object of admiration in other nations,
and so worthy of our own respect and veneration.

‘Greece also exhibited the earliest dawnings of
political liberty. While the nations around her
were living in barbarism, or submitting to tyranny,

she was emerging from da1‘kn.ess into the light of t

freedom. About the time when Saul was made

king over Israel, Athens abolished royalty. The
‘ancient Grecians were the ﬁrst people to under-

stand their rights, and to assert them; the first to
discover that the people are the only legitimate
source of political poWer-+that the true end of
government is to ensure the happiness of the pea»
ple atlarge—-—by establishing equal laws——-—promot-
ing justice, and punishing crimes; the first to
establish constitutions on a basis to secure these
ends.

There was in the Grecian character a nobleness »

and ingenuousness of sentiment which makes it
seem almost desirable to have lived ‘among them.
There is a curious anecdote of an old man, a stran-
ger at Athens, who went i one evening into the

theatre. As he approached theseats the j.All16':

_ therefore compelled to stand in ‘asituation very

conspicuous and embarrassing, and exposed to ridi-
cule. The Lacedemonians, who held age in great
veneration, perceiving‘ his confusion,‘and touched

with pity, by a general sympathy all rose at once

to offer him a seat. The volatile Athenians,
struck-with such urbanity,- suddenly gave a thun-
der of applause. - The old man replied, “The
Athenians know what is good——the Lacedemoni~
ans practise it.”   * 

Their patriotism was of the loftiest kind. ‘Where

is the man in our day who would voluntarily saca
riﬂce his life for his country’! Yet many instana

ces are furnished by the history of Greece, in

which men laid down their lives to beneﬁt their '

country; and they did this in a manner more
unequivocal and more frequently than any other
nation. Th.e Athenians were once engaged in a

dangerous War. Anporacle, supposed" to declare‘

the will of heaven, when consulted in respect to

the War, said that the nation Whose king was first
slain should be victorious. The king of Athens,

perceiving that it would be diﬂicult for him to be
slain in the common course of events, dressed

himself in disguise, Went into the enemy’s army, ‘

and allowed himself to be killed. ‘

With the Greeks, personal attachment had more
inﬂuence, and private interest less, than with
almost any other people. Xerxes the Great was
much surprised when a Greek, who was admitted
to his conﬁdence, told him that the Greeks did not
ﬁght. for money. “And pray,” said he, “ what do
they ﬁght for?” , “They fight,” said. the other,
“for glory.” The brave men who fought and fell
with Leonidas" at the straits of Thermopylae,

GREECE. . r 77

were inspired by the love of country, by devotion
to their leader, to one another, to glory.

Many of them seemed to live for the interest and
ha_ppiness of their friends. Solon’s rule for measur-

inghappiness, proposed to Croesus, king of Lydia,

was to “live in love, and die in, peace.” And he
told the haughty monarch thatCleobis and Biton,
two obscure young men, who spent their time in
performing their duty to their country and the gods,
in acts of kindness to their friends, and of ﬁlial
piety to their mother, were happy men.

colony, there is an account of two young Grecian
noblemen, Damon and Pythias, wholived in the
reign of Dionysius the tyrant. They had, for a
long time, cultivated the strictest intimacy and
friendship, and pursued an unimpeachable course
of life. But the spirit of liberty, prevalent among
the Greeks, had, on various occasions, appeared;
and many had fallen victims to the suspicions of

G the tyrant.

At length, one of the two friends, Damon, was
seized by Dionysius, and condemned to die. But
as he had business abroad of consequence to his
family, which he wished to settle beforehis death,
he applied to the king for permission to go; and

  his friend Pythias offered himself as a hostageto

remain in prison till his return, or die in his stead
if he did not return. The king accepted the sub;
stitute, and Damon went on his journey.

‘Nhen the time appointed ,for the execution
of the sentence drew‘ near, the criminal hadnot
returned, a.nd everybody now began tobelieve that
he had made his escape, and left Pythias involved
in ruin. Pythias ma_intained,. however-, with ~un~——
shaken confidence‘, that his friend would. return,

unless prevented by death or unavoidable neces-

sity, in which case heshould submit to hisfate

’ without repining. t

The day and the hour arrived; no criminal apn
peared. An immense crowd of people asseinbled
to see the result of so strange an event, Dionysius
himself expressed great uneasiness, but as he
expected it had been a plan contrived to screen
the offender, he was determined to inflict the sen-—
tence on the hostage. Pythias was led to the
scaffold. He ascended with an undaunted air
and ﬁrm step, but,_ lest the honor of his friend
shouldbe tarnished, he requestedias much delay
as the forms of proceeding in such cases would
admit. i
1 What was the astonishment of the whole con:
course, when, at this critical moment, the cry of
“Damon! Damon!” was heard from an extreme
part‘ of the assembly. He approachedywith haste
and terror lest he had come too late, and impeded
by the greatness of the crowd, he drew his sword,
and forced his waythrough the throng, till he
rushed into the arms of his friend. ' i

But here a scene ensued which is not easily
described. Nor is it possible to say whether
the sincerity of their friendship, or their ‘s1.1peri-

GREECE. 79

ority to death, excited the most admiration. If the
king was amazed at the return of Damon, he
was more amazed to see Pythias still resolutely
determined to die in his stead. In short, the con-—
testnow was which should die. Each one saw

stronger reasons for wishing his friendto live, than t i

to live himself; each one claimed ‘the right of

a being the sacriﬁce.

While'tl1e two friends were engaged in this un-
paralleled dispute, the i tone of public sympathy

rose to frenzy, and thehaughty monarch feared

that compassion for? his victim might suddenly
change into fury, and ‘hurl him from his throne.
He felt that a tyrant’s power is not equal to the
power of virtue, and that a man imbued with
noble sentiments is greater than a monarch with-
out them. a He rosefrom his seat, and embracing

p the two friends, with tears in his eyes, pronounced

a free pardon, bade them both live for each other’s

sal:e,and desired they wouldadmit him as a third,
-in a bond of union, so sacred, and so noble.

It is in respect to a people thus characterized
by greatness, that we have occasion to observe and
regret, that if in genius, taste, learning, patriotism,

‘love of i liberty, and heroism, they stand unri-

valled among the nations of antiquity, yet they
had many traits in their character to be con-
demned. They were volatile and ﬁckle, ungrate~
ful to their benefactors, ﬁerce in their resentments,
and bloody in their revenge. i s

The injustice that they manifested» towards

some of their most illustrious patriots and philos-
ophers was remarkable.-~ It must be admitted, too,
that their standard’ of morality, formed without

the light of Christianity, was very low. The s

boundaries of right and Wrong were in many
things, undeﬁned, and the strongest had generally
the advantage,

On the whole, We are forced to confessthat one
great lesson taughtus by the history of this inte1'~
esting people is, that the human mind, under
favorable cir-cumstances, by its own unassisted
efforts may develop powers, achieve deeds, and
display" traits of great beauty and sublimity~——but
that it still Wanders in sad uncertainty as to the

great end of existence, and that if capable of _dis~
covering the rules of Justice and virtue, it is still i

unable to devise sutﬁcienbmotives to enforce and
establish them.

CHAPTER XXVII.

Athens. Political Divisions ef the People.

THE city of Athens was the capital of Attica, a

. small territory situated to the north of the Gulf of

Saron. It was founded by Gecrops, an Egyptian,
who led thither a colony and introduced a knowlé
edge of the arts and sciences, 1556, B. C. It occu-
pied the summit of a rocky mount,in the midst of

a large plain, about ﬁve miles from the sea ; and as
the city increased, it ﬁlled a large space of the

nei ihborin plain. The Acro olis or u aer cit *.

was fortiﬁed as a citadel. This part of Athens

was greatly embellished, in the glorious days of A

the republic, with temples, statues, and menu;
ments. Here are still magnificent remains of that

The seaports of Athens were the Portus Pha-le-=

was encompassed with a strong wall, that joined

it to the Piraeus, 'I‘wo Walls,‘ of about ﬁve miles ‘

The inhabi-tants of Athens were divided into:
three classes; the freemen, strangers residing in
the country, and the slaves. VVhen Athens Was

" in its highest prosperity, the number of free citi--

zens was about 20,000; of fore-igne-rs and stran-—
gers, 10,000 ;,and_of slaves, 400,000. 0

The freemen were persons whose fathers were
citizens in their own right. If, hewever, an
Athenian married a foreign woman, his child could
not be enrolled among the citizens, unless by con-
ferring some signal beneﬁt on the state. This
admission could only take place in an assembly of
the people, and was required to be ratiﬁed in a
second assembly. From time to time, an inquest
was held to clear Athens of pretended citizens.
Fathers were careful to register the names of their
sons in the Ward to which they belonged; young
persons, at the age of eighteen, were enrolled a
second time. 0  

The citizens were divided into tribes, at first

four in number, but afterwards increased to ten..
The freemen alone had a voice in the election of

magistrates, and in popular assemblies.

2i'rHENs.+—~i)1v1sIoNs or THE PEOPLE. 83

Strangers residing at Athens" were protected by

, the law, and allowed’ to follow trades, or spend

their fortunes; but were incapable of voting, or of

‘being elected to any potﬁce. They were subject to

an extra tribute, in additionto the taxes paid by

the free citizens. On certain public processions,

they carried a badge of distinction, bywhieh they
were known from the Athenians. Such‘ strangers
as had rendered eminent service to thelrepublic,
were exempted from this requisition.

After a plague, or destructive war, it was usual
to replenish the city byadmitting strangers to the
rank of ifrleeineii. To cement the freemen and
strangers in closer union, each stranger was re-
quired : to select some principal citizen to be his

patron, to protect him from oppression.

i tilt is painful to reflect that, in a country where.
the inhabitants prided themselves upon their lib-
erty, and were ready to make such sacriﬁces to
defend it, there should ,,ha.\te been slaves, greatly
surpassing the free citizensin number. In Athens

they ‘were about twenty times as numerous as

the citizens. Slaves were of two sorts; natural
born Greeks, who themselves, or whose parents, by
poverty, captivity, or other misfortune, had been
reduced to that condition; or foreigners, imported
from abroad. The former were favored; both by
law andcustom, much more than the latter. .

A At Athens, slaves were in general more mildly

treated, than in other parts of Greece. In times

of danger, some obtained their freedom by ﬁghting
in defence of the state. They might also, if p;roVi-
dent,'amass a little property toredeem themselves.
In general, masters were careful not to allow slaves

the use of arms; neither might theyimitate the
dress and manners of freemen. I

The Athenian slaves were employed in cultiva-
ting the lands; they also wrought in the mines
and quarries, and performed all the domestic ,ser~
vices in private families, Slaves from other coun~
tries were exposed in the public markets for sale.

_A.t Athens, when a slave. was first carried home,

an entertainment was provided as a welcome to
his new service. It was the interest ‘of the master
to treat his slaves with mildness, and attach them
to his service, but he had full power overthose

which were bought, and might evensjputttltem to

death.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

Of the Government of A Athens.

THE government of Athens was at ﬁrst mon~

. archical ; but after the death of Codrus, annual
magistrates, called archons, were elected and pla-

ced at the head of the government. Occasionally,
however, individuals obtained an extraordinary

ascendancy in the state. This was the case with

the tyrant Pisistratusand his sons; and after them,
Pericles ruled Athens, by the consent of the people,

nearly forty Years. The usual government was

carried on b.y the nine archons, by a senate of
500, and by assemblies of the people. 
The persons appointed to the office of archon,

GOVERNMENT or ATHENS. 85,

were elected. from the principal citizens by lot.
After their nomination, they were subjected totwo

rigorous examinations; the first was before the

senate, and the other in the forum, before the

magistrates, called heliastre. They were required;
to show that they were descended of ancestors,‘

who for three generations had been Athenian
citizens '; to specify the tribe and district to which
they belonged; to adduce proofs of their ﬁlial
piety, and of having served their country faith-l
fully, and borne arms in its defence.

If scompetent, the yarchons, took. an oath faithfully
to administer justice, and to receive no presents,
01', in case of so doing, that they would dedicate
to Apollo, at Delphos, a statue of gold, equal in
weight to themselves. When their functions
expired, aninquisition of their conduct took place,
and if they had conducted themselves with pro»

priety, a prospect was held out of their being,

admitted into the Areopagus.

In the discharge of their duties, the archons
wore branches of myrtle, and, in case any one
offered them insult or obstruction, the offender
was amerced in a heavy ﬁne, and deprived of most
of the privileges of citizens. The archons were
remunerated, by exemption from certain taxes.

The chief of the nine archons was denominated
The Archon, in distinction, because the year was
called by his name. He decided on causes be»
tween married persons; also concerning wills,
divorces, and legacies; he was the general guar»-
dian of orphans. The theatres and public diver-5
sions were under his control, and his office requir-
edhim to regulate festivals in honor of the gods;
to watch over the public morals, and restrain ﬂa-»

grant offences; He was empowered to inspect the

public markets, and punish the venders of un-

wholesome provisions. \ .
The second archon was called king, and wore a

crown. He decided upondisputes in certain fami-at

lies of priests, regulated many sacriﬁces to the gods,
and generally punished offences against religion.

Accusations ofmurder were made before him ; and i

if he saw cause, he sent the accused to be tried
by the areopagites, among whom he had a seat
and right of r suffrage, but -simply as a member of
the court, and when he attended, he laid asidehis
crown. ,   7 by .

' Another archon exercised over strangers the

same authority which the preceding archon had

over citizens. ,He superintended certain. festivals
and sacriﬁces to Mars and Diana- He also ada
judged the honors to be paid to citizens who fell
in the wars, and to provide for their orphans from

p the public treasury. — t

The other six archons presided in courts for the
trial of civil affairs respecting property, as ‘belong-

ring either to citiz“ens or strangers. They were

also to assist in Watching over the rightsof the
people and preserve tranquillity, especially during

the night.

The archons had officers, well acquainted
with the laws and accounts, to assist them.
There were subordinate magistrates, scattered
through the different tribes, to manage their pe-
culiar interests, and regulate minor details in the
police. ‘

Thepsupreme power of ‘enacting laws and deci-
ding in matters of government was, by Solon, vested
in the assemblies of the citizens; but to prevent

GOVERNMENT or ATHENS. 87

the ill consequences that might arise from hasty
and ignorant advisers, he constituted a council of
four hundred, in which all proposals should be
be agitated, before they were submitted to the
people. l

About eighty-.six a years after Solon, when the:

numbers of tribes had increased from four to ten,

one hundred members wereadded to the councii
or senate, which made their number ﬁve hundred,
or ﬁfty for each tribe. . The senators were chosen
by lot from the different tribes. The names of all

the citizens in the tribe qualiﬁed for oﬂice were

engraved on tablets of brass, and cast into a vessel;
into another was put an equal number of beans,
all of which were black, except ﬁfty, which were
White. The name of a citizen and a bean were
drawn out together, and if the bean was white, he
was proclaimed senator} In this manner they
proceeded till the whoyle fifty were chosen. They
were elected for one year.   T

,The power of this senate was considerable.
They debated all measures of public interest and
Welfare, and examined the accounts of all the
magistrates at the expiration of their oﬂice. They
had care of all such as received public aims; they
appointed goalers for the prisons, and could punish
for offences not prohibited by anylaw. They also
had the charge of building ships of War. Each
senator was allowed a drachm a day, as a com.-»
pensation for the loss of time. g p

All freemen of Athens had the right of attending
the public assemblies; but strangers, slaves, W0-
men and children were excluded. They were
held four times every thirty—ﬁVe days, and also
in cases of extraordinary emergency. When the

88 GOVERNMENT or ATHENS,

citizens were remiss in attendance, the magistrates *

shut up all the gates, except such as led to the
place of assembly, and removed all goods from the

market—place. As a farther inducement, an al-t

lowance in moneyof three oboli Was given to all
who were present at an earlyshour. “

After certain religious ceremonies, the decree of i

the senate was read, and then a herald pro»
elaimed: “Wl1ot above ﬁfty yearswill speak?”

After the old men had given their opinion, pro-“

elamation was made that every citizen" Was at
liberty to speak. The people ‘gave their suffrages
by holding up their hands; but on certain occa~
.sions"by ballot. , t

Omit-.\’¢ addressiate the people of Athens.

The popular assemblies decided respecting peace
or War; they received ambassadors, conﬁrmed or
abrogated laws; nominated to almost every oﬂice;
granted the freedom of the state to foreigners; and
decreed honos to- such as had deserved well of
the republic.

GOVERNMENT or ATHENS.‘ 89

The chief inconvenience attending the popular
‘assemblies was the power which the orators exer—-
cisedlover the popular ,will by their eloquence;
for factions and personal motives, they often
recommended measures inimical to the honor and
interests of their country. The orators were also
accessible to bribes from foreign princes; and the
eloquence and patriotism of Demosthenes were too
successfully opposed. by the. gold of Philip» of
Macedon, received by other speakers.

I In Athens the constitution was entirely demo»
cratical, but there was always a powerful body of
rich individuals, who thought it advisable to curb
the power ‘of the people; and they often succeeded
in their object. Hence, there was a constant jeal-A
ousy of their power in the minds of the people,
and, unfortunately, it was chieﬂy levelled at their
ablest men, who .-had signalized themselves the
most by their service to the state. a

From this fear of the loss of power, the people
were led to commit acts of ﬂagrant ingratitude and
injustice towards their greatest benefactors. Mil—-
tiades, who had sacriﬁced his own interest to the
general welfare and common cause of Greece; who
had in fact saved Athens, by his heroism and
military talents, was unjustly condemned to pay an
excessive fine, and, being unable to pay it, he lan-
guished the remainder of his days in prison. His
son Cimon, after his father’s death, was put -in
prison till this debt should be discharged. To free
themselves also from any apprehension of charac-

ters deservedly popular, they had recourse to an‘.

arbitrary mode of punishment, called ostracism-—~
a state of exile that lasted for ten years.

The process of condemnation was curious. Of E

the assembled citizens, each took an oyster—shell,
or tile, and havingtwritten upon it the name of the
person intended to be expelled, carried it to the

market-place, where a piece of ground ,was enclos- '

ed with wooden rails for that purpose, having ten
gates for the ten tribes to enter separately, The
tiles or shells were there deposited ; and if, when
numbered by the archon, they amounted to ten
thousand, the person so prescribed, was adjudged
to the ostracism. A similar usage prevailed , at
Argos, Miletus and Meg-ara. - ’ A '

Aristides was banished in this way, from envy
of his character, vsoogloriously acquired in the sur-
name of “the Just.” A similarjealousy forced
Themistocles into banishment, after he had saved
Athens and all Greece, by his admirable conduct
in the Persian war. Cimon, Timotheus and other
great commanders, who had distinguished them-
selves, preferred living‘ as much as possiblein other
countries. Alcibiades was alternately caressed
and persecuted by the people; till, by their indis-
creet conduct towards «him, other generals in the
Peloponesian war, brought calamity and ruin on
their state.   V A A

To distinguished individuals, of whom they en-
tertained no fear, the Athenians gave, as a reward,

crowns in their public assemblies. These, were

conferred by general suffrage, and were afterwards
preserved in the families of - those who had ob-
tained them, as marks of 4 honor. Foreign cities,
by their ambassadors, might also present crowns
to their meritorious citizens, after having received

permission of the people.

CHAPTER XXIX.

  Tlle Court, of Areopagus.

THE court of Areopaguswas in the greatest,re—-
pute throughout Greece, for the Wisdom and jus-
tice of its decisions. It was sometimes convened
in the royal portico, but more frequently in a kind
of hall,adefended from the weather by a sort of

rustic roof. This court, received its name from

being held sometimes on an eminence, near" the
citadel, called the hill of Mars.

The origin of this court has been referred to _

Cecrops, but its jurisdiction was then confined to
criminal cases of life and death. This continued
to form their chief business in all subsequent
periods; but they also, at one time, assumed the in-
spection and custody of the laws, the guardianship

of young rmen, whom they provided with tutors, T
to be ‘brought up suitably to their rank. They «

also punished transgressors of decorum and mor-

als, idleness, rapine, and theft, as well as impiety ’

towards the gods.
‘The members of this court held their office for

life. Such archons as had acquitted themselves T

with honor at the expiration of their magistracy,
were admitted into the Areopagus. Othercitizens
of irreproachable morals received this honor. The
strictest propriety of conduct and behavior, was
required of the members. To have been seen sit-
ting in a tavern, was regarded. asa sufficient rea-
son for exclusion. Any" one found guilty of gross

immorality was expelled. The members were

92 COURT or AREOPAGUS.

forbidden to write comedies. To laugh during
the sitting of the court, would have been thought
a blameable levity. ,

It is related that a member of the Areopagus
stifled a bird, that, for fear," had taken refuge in
his breast. For this act he was expelled, it being
considered that the man whose breast was in’ac~

cessible_ to pity, was disqualiﬁed to sitin judgment

on the lives of his fellow-creat,ures. ' Foreign
states frequently refe’rred their disputes‘ to the ar-
bitration of the Areopagus. ~

This court usually met on the 2'7th,t28th and
29th day of every month, or more frequently, if
urgent business required it. They sat and deter-
mined all causes by night and in darkness, that
they might not be inﬂuenced in favor either of the
criminaleor. the, accuser, and that noone might

know the number or discern the -countenances of T
the judges.’ They sat on seats of ‘stone, and held’

in their hands a sort of baton as a badge of oﬁice.
When a multiplicity of business required‘ it,
they divided themselves into committees, to de-

cide on separate causes. These appointments

were made by lot, that it might not be known
who was to try any cause, and that thereby no
one might be corrupted or bribed to prejudge any
cause. The members received three oboli, that
is, about sixty cents, for every‘ cause they tried,
and they sometimes received gifts from the people.

Acropolis in Athens.

Bnsmss the Areopagus, there were ten other
courts of justice among the Athenians; four of
which took cognizance of homicides, assaults, and
other matters of blood; the other six were for civil
causes. , i

The judges were chosen from all the citizens
indiscriminately; the very lowest being eligible.
The only pre—requisites were, that they should be
thirty years of age, and innocent of any criminal-
ity. The number of these judges was about six
thousand; but, strictly speaking, they were mere’-
ly jurymen to assist the presiding magistrate.
One inducement to become a judge was, that they

received for every trial an obolus, about twenty

cents, each, and sometimes three oboli.
This recompense occasioned an annual expen~

94 SPARTA.

diture to the state of about one hundred and ﬁfty
thousand dollars a year. That the proﬁts might
be more equally divided, no person was allowed
to sit in two courts the same_day. ‘ Such as were
qualiﬁed to sit on trials, and had. leisure any day
for that purpose, attended and gave in their
names; a sufficient number was then elected by
lot for the diﬁ"erentcourt.s. for that day.

They received tablets to indicate this, and on
presenting them to the officers of thecourt, were

admitted, and received"'each a sceptre,'asan<en—r

si n of authorit . On- leavin the court and
g V g 7

giving back their sceptres, they received their ' re-
compense for attendance. . ~
The Athenians were so litigious, that persons

went about to seek occasions for commencing a
suit, or bringing an accusation againstpersons of
respectability. Many of them indulged in a pre-
dominant inclination to chicanery, and all the ar»
tiﬁces of pettifogging.

The most distinguishing trait in the character
of the Athenians, was their attachment to the

arts, to literature and philosophy. Hence arose

innumerable distinguished architects, sculptors,
poets, historians, and philosophers, who rendered
Athens the most splendid and illustrious city on
the earth. Their literary character secured to the
inhabitants the respect of their conquerors, long
after their political’ power was extinct. From
none did they experience this more than from

Alexander the Great. ‘

I In the different fate which befel Athens and
Lacedaemon, or Sparta, we have an example of
the superiority which letters give to onenation
over another, when that nation has,‘besides, dis-

spasm. , 95

played military virtues. Lacedaemonwas differ»
ent from Athens in all respects. It was an inland,
not a maritime city; its power depended chieﬂy
on its landforces, and not on its fleets; its wealth
arosefrorn agriculture, and not from commerce.

Whilst the Athenians indulged in every kind
of elegant luxury, the Lacedaernonians gloried in
their plain, simple, hardy manner of living, no
less exempt from pomp and splendor, than from
efferninacy and sensuality. The Athenians were
desirous of enjoying the mental and physical
pleasures of life; whilst the Lacedeemonians were
anxious to form laborious and virtuous citizens,
and by the terror of their arms to rule in every
state in Greece. ' i

Lycurgus was the great legislator of Sparta, and‘

on his institutions the power of their state was
founded. They became the laws of Lacedeemon.
several hundred years prior to the Christian era,

and they were observed, in some particulars, lon '

after the state had submitted to the supremacy 0
Rome. Apolonius of Tyanaea found them still
in force at Lacedaemon, during the reign‘ of Do-
mitian about theyear 100 A..’D. t

Lacedeemon, or Sparta, was the chief city of
the adjoining territory, called Laconia. There
Weremany other towns in the district, confederated
with the capital, but much inferior in im’poi‘tanee
and character. Their deputies however, insisted
on deliberations respecting peace or war, or other
matters connectedwith the general welfareof the
whole state. .
