-t,O/~" gKNOW thyself," is old and good advice.
As the body is an important part of
a person, we are only obeying this counsel
when we learn how it is built, how it lives,
and what is good or bad for its health.
Because many people are ignorant of the
true nature of alcoholic drinks and other poisons, the law in some parts of our country
requires the pupils in the public schools to
study the human body and the effects of
these drugs upon it.
From these lessons you will learn, first,
what these drugs are. That you may understand what they will do to those who use
them, you must then learn about the human
body and how to take care of it.
When you see what alcohol, tobacco, and
opium, do to its many wonderful parts, and
what trouble and sorrow they cause, you will
know why it is dangerous to use them.send an extra amounlt of sali-va into the
mouth, as if the food was there ready for
its acti-on.
TOBACCO AND THE MOUTH.
Sores on the lips, and even cancers, sometimes result from the use of tobacco; the
breath, foul and repulsive, shows the condition of the stomach, the tissues, and the
blood; the gums of smokers and chewers often
become spongy, and their teeth are soiled
and dark, instead of being white and pure.
The effect of the poison is to make the
mouth dry, thus causing an extra amount
of saliva to be poured out from the glands.
But the constant spitting of the tobacco
juice, robs one of the saliva needed for digestion, and thus brings on dyspepsia.
Besides doing this harm to the user, the
habit of spitting is a very impolite one. It
makes floors and sidewalks unfit for cleanly
people to walk on, and endangers the clothing of all who are near.
A man who should spit directly at another
would be thought very insulting. Is he re94specting the rights of others, though he may
not intend to insult them, when he sends
the foul juice a little to one side-or where
they must tread at the next step?
In many cases, tobacco acts as the usher
at the door of the saloon, because the dryness of the mouth which it produces, makes
the user thirsty.  But it is not a natural
thirst, -it can not be satisfied by water; for
tobacco so affects the nerves, as often to make
one crave another narcotic.
Those in charge of inebriate asylums say
that nearly all their patients have been users
of tobacco as well as of alcohol.
THE ESOPHAGUS.
When divided by the teeth and softened
and changed by the saliva, the food is ready
to be swallowed, or sent into the esophagus,
the passage-way to the stomach.
Look at the throat of a horse when he
is drinking, and you- will see the motion of
the ring-shaped muscles of this tube.
Food and drink do not simply slide down
the esophagus; a horse often bends his head
95when he drinks, so that his mouth is really
lower than his stomach.
The muscles contract, one after the other,
and push the food gently onward. For this
reason, a juggler is able to perform the common trick of drinking a glass of water, while
standing on his head.
THE STOMACH.
The stomach is a strong muscular bag in
the left side of the abdomen (ab d' men). Its
inner lining has many glands which separate
from  the blood a jLlice, called gastric juice.
In this is a substance named pepsin (pep' sin),
which digests the flesh-making parts of our
food.
The next coat contains muscular fibers.
These stretch and shrink in such a way,
that the food is gently moved from one end
of the stomach to the other, and so forced
to mix with the gastric juice.
Some parts of the food are ready for use
when they enter the stomach. These are at
once taken up by tiny blood-vessels, carried to
the liver, and then to the heart. The process
96by which food-materials enter the blood, is
called absorption (ab sorp'shuin).
When the work of the stomach is ended,
the food which is left is a grayish fluid,
called chyme (kim.) It consists mainly of the
tissue-making substances and the fats that
have been eaten. Most of the starch and
sugar, after being prepared in the mouth, has
already entered the blood.
THE INTESTINES.
This part of the food-canal is a small
tube, about twenty-five feet long in an adult,
coiled very closely in the abdomen.  You
wvill understand it better by looking at the
intestines of a chicken, when the cook is
"drawing" it in the kitchen.
Much  remains to be done before the
chyme is ready to enter the blood. The
glands of the intestines are helped by two
other glands which lie in the abdomen, one
on the right side of the body-the liver,
and the other toward the left-the pancreas
(pan' ere As).
These send into the intestines, through a
97small tube, the bile and the pancreatic
(pan ereAt'le) juice, which, with the intestinal
juices, divide and prepare the fats.
If the mouth, or the stomach, has failed
in any part of its work, these juices in the
intestines do their best to complete the
task. They can often do but little, however,
and so we may lose part of the value of the
food.
When fully digested, the milky mass is
called chyle (knl, and is ready to enter the
blood. It does this by soaking through the
thin walls of blood-vessels and tiny tubes
called lacteals (lae'te als).
STEPS OF DIGESTION.
In a large factory, each man has a special
task to perform; the spinners do not attend
to the looms, the weavers have nothing to
do in the engine-room. So in the body, each
part has its own work.
The saliva, to  an  extent, digests the
starch foods. The gastric juice digests the
tissue-making foods. The bile and pancreatic
juice digest the fats.
1)1GtST1 01;.If one must eat rapidly, as at a railroad
station, the meal should be mainly of meat,
as that will give strength and need not be
mixed with the saliva for digestion.
The heat of the stomach must be over
100~, in order to digest the food properly.
Ice-water at once lowers the temperature:
if taken too freely at meals, the stomach
must stop working until it can get " warmed
up" again. Such delays in the process of
digestion are injurious.
MEALS.
Most healthy persons have three meals a
day, at intervals of five or six hours. Since
the stomach, like other muscles, needs rest,
one should not eat between meals. The mind
either helps or hinders the body: the food
digests much more readily if there is pleasant,
cheerful thought and talk at the table.
An old Eastern story tells of a stranger
who met the Plague coming from Bagdad.
"You have been committing great havoc
there," said the trader, pointing to the city.
"Not so great," replied the Plague; "I
00killed only one-third of those who died; the
other two - thirds killed themselves with
fright."
ALCOHOL AND THE STOMACH.
As soon as alcohol enters this organ, it
is hurried on into the blood-vessels; for the
stomach knows it can not be digested, and is
useless to the body. But the very short time
it stays there,is enough to cause great harm.
It can not pass through the thin walls
of the blood-vessels unless mixed with water.
It needs even more water than was contained in the liquors which were drunk;
so it shrinks and thickens the delicate lining
of the stomach, by robbing it of its moisture. In health, this lining is slightly red,
tinged with yellow.
The blood does not move properly, or as
it should, in the blood-vessels of even the
"moderate drinker," and those in the stomach
soon become sw6llen..In the drunkard, the
case is likely to be still worse; for sores
sometimes appear on the walls of the stomach.
If one stops drinking liquors which contain
1 00alcohol, these will be cured. They do not
pain the drinker as they would if on the surface of the body, for reasons which you will
understand when you study the nerves.
Sickness, thirst, headache, coated tongue,
feverish pulse, go with these conditions of
the stomach. The only possible cure is to
stop drinking liquor at once and forever.
There is enough alcohol in strong spirits
to harden the tissue-making foods, which
must be changed to a liquid form in the
stomach, before they can be absorbed.
Alcohol, of any considerable strength, separates the pepsin from the gastric juice and
prevents its proper action on the food.
Dr. Munroe, of England, proved this by
an interesting experiment.  He put equal
quantities of finely-minced beef into three
bottles. Then into one, he poured water and
gastric juice- from the stomach of a calf;
into another, alcohol with gastric juice; and
into the third, pale ale and gastric juice.
The bottles were kept at the same heat
as the human stomach, and the contents
moved about like those of that organ.

Study this table carefully, and see how the
clear alcohol and that in the ale, destroyed
the power of the gastric juice, by taking out
the pepsin from it. It often has a similar
effect on that in the stomach, though it
remains there but a short time.
SEEING   DIGESTION.
By this time you wonder, perhaps, how
all these things are known, when the stomach  is covered  up  in  our bodies.Some of them  the doctors have learned
by studying the stomachs of dead persons.
But there has been one good chance to look
into a live man's stomach and see what was
going on there.
In 1822, a man named Alexis St. Martin,
was shot in his left side. When the wound
healed, it left a hole in his stomach, partly
closed by a fold of the inner lining. This
could be pushed aside, so that one could look
directly into the stomach.
By this means, the doctor who had charge
of him, learned much about the digestion of
food, and the effects of alcohol upon the
stomach. Later experiments upon the stomachs of living men and of the lower animals,
have taught us much more on this subject.
TOBACCO AND THE STOMACH.
As already said, the nicotine of tobacco is
almost sure to cause sickness of the stomach
and vomiting, in those who are just beginning to use the poison. It injures the lining
of the stomach, hinders the flow of the gas108ALCOHOL.
LCOIIOL  is a colorless liquid with  a
stinging taste; it burns without soot,
giving little light, but great heat.  It is
lighter than water, and can not be frozen.
It is used to dissolve gums, resins, and
oils; to make smokeless flames; to take from
leaves, roots, barks, and seeds, materials for
making perfumes and medicines; and to keep
dead bodies from decaying.
People do not usually drink clear alcohol
(Al'e6 hS1). Rum, whiskey, wine, cider, gin,
brandy, beer, etc., are water and alcohol with
different flavors.  Many million gallons of
alcohol in these liquors are drunk every year
by the people of this country.
ORIGIN OF ALCOHOL.

apple, and other fruit and plant juices. The

power impaired.
OTHER ORGANS OF THE ABDOMEN.
THE LIVER.
This is the largest organ in the body and
one of the most important. It fills the whole
of the right and upper side of the abdomen.
One part of its work is to secrete the bile,
or gall, used in digestion.
This juice, when not needed, is stored in
a little sac, called the gall-bladder. It is of
a dark yellow color, and "bitter as gall'" is
a common proverb.
The liver also changes, in some way not
clearly understood, the chyme brought to it
104from the stomach, aids in the manufacture
of blood, and in the preparation of wornout materials for removal from the body.
ALCOHOL AND THE LIVER.
While we can not fully explain all its action, we know that diseases of the liver affect
all the other organs.
More alcohol goes to the liver and brain
than to any other parts of the body. By it,
the gall may be changed from yellow to
green or black, and from a thin fluid to a
thick one.
The liver itself often' becomes twice its
natural size; in other cases, it is filled with
useless fat, like the muscles..When rough
and shrunken, with hard lumps or knots, it
is called by the English, "hob-nailed," or
"gin liver."  This condition is caused only
by alcohol and is incurable.
The coal-heavers of London drink a great
deal of gin, whiskey, and ale. They seem
strong, but they often sicken and die from
a mere scratch. Their blood is so poisoned
from their diseased livers that the wound
105festers, does not readily heal, and frequently
proves fatal.
THE KIDNEYS.
These are two oval glands at the back of
the abdomen, that carry a large part of the
waste matter out of the body.
ALCOHOL AND THE KIDNEYS.
A serious, because usually fatal, sickness,
is called "Bright's disease of the kidneys."
This may be caused in many ways; but it
is most often the result of alcoholic drinks,
especially if combijied with exposure to wet
and cold.

for the body."*
Alcohol robs the body of water and can
not be used by it as a fluid.

INSPIRATION AND EXPIRATION.
LACE your hands firmly against your' sides, and draw long, deep breaths. Notice that the side walls of your chest are
not fixed, but move out and in, as you
breathe, about eighteen times a minute.
Hold your hand close before your face,
and you will feel a current of air upon it,
as the ribs move in. Breathe upon a mirror,
and a thin film of water covers it, coming
from your breath. On a cold winter day, this
partly freezes, and you say you can "see
your breath."
The diaphragm is a strong muscle which
forms the partition between the chest and
the abdomen. When the ribs m-nove outward, this moves downward, and air entersyour chest through the organs of breathing;
this is called inspiration (Inspi r' tion).
When  the  ribs move back into  position,
and the diaphragm moves upward, the air

is forced out, bringing with it water and
other waste material; this is called expiration (6x pl r&amp;'tion). Taken together, these make
up breathing or respiration (r6s pi f' tion).
110ORGANS OF BREATHING.
The organs of breathing are the nose and
mouth, through which air enters the body,
the larynx (lar- ynx), windpipe, bronchial (br6ro'kIal) tubes, and lungs.
LARYNX AND WINDPIPE.
From the back of the mouth, the air
passes down a straight tube at the front of
the chest, called the windpipe or trachea (tra'kke ). This is made of ring-shaped cartilages
and is easily felt through the skin of the
neck. Its upper end is the larynx, the organ
of voice.
The larynx swells out at the front, is
larger in men than in women, and is sometimes called, "Adam's apple."  It is a tubelike box, formed by the union of gristly
and elastic parts, and is covered by a movable lid, called the epiglottis (6p I gl6t'tis). This
is open when we breathe, so that the air
can enter. When we swallow, the epiglottis
closes the entrance to the windpipe, and the
food passes across it to the esophagus.
111Sometimes, we try to swallow and breathe
at the same time; then this little cover does
not shut down quickly enough to prevent
particles of food or drink from going " the
wrong way."  The windpipe can not bear
this and coughs them out at once, if possible; if not, we are "choked."
VOCAL CORDS.
We speak by means of the air moving
strong bands of membrane, called vocal cords,
which are at the top of the larynx. The lips,
teeth, and other organs, help us in talking.
BRONCHIAL TUBES AND LUNGS.
The lower end of the trachea separates
into two branches, one of which is sent to
each lung; these branches are the bronchial
tubes.
These tubes divide and divide again, as
the branch of a tree breaks up into smaller
twigs. They end in very small sacs, or cells.,
into which the air passes.

These move back and forth, and help to

11-3Under the ripening action of the sun, this
starch  turns  to  sugar;  this  sugar gives us
our sweet-tasting fruits and plants; and from
such juices, boiled down, we get the sugar
used for food.
If this fruit or plant juice is drawn off
from its pulp, and then exposed to the open
air at summer heat, the sweet part changes:
it is no longer sugar, because it has separated
into a liquid called alcohol and a gas named
car bon'ic ac'id. Much of this gas goes off
into the air; the alcohol remains in the
liquid, changing a wholesome food into a
dangerous drink.
ALCOHOL A POISON.*
A poison is any substance whose nature
it is, when taken into the body, either in
small or large quantities, to injure health or
destroy life.
* Dr. A. B. Palmer, of 3Michigan Uni'iersity, says: "Medical
writers admit that by far the most disastrous and frequent cause
of poisoning in all our communities, is the use of alcohol."
Dr. James Edmonds, of England, says: " The effects of no other
common poison are more.direct' and certain than those of alcohol."
Dr. W. J. Youmans writes: "Alcohol.             a brain
poison."
10the air, and to carry it out with the mucus
(ma'eas) when it does get in.
WORK  OF THE LUNGS.
A.network of tiny blood-vessels, or capillaries (edp' ill riz) covers the outside of the
lung-cells. Having thin walls like the cells,
the bloocl which they carry is brought close
to the air in the lungs. By this means, a
strange and important change takes place.
Certain waste matters, including carbonic
acid and water, pass from the blood througl
the walls of the capillaries and lung-cells,
into the air, and are breathed out at the
next expiration. At the same time, the blood
takes a part'of the air, called oxygen (6x' jIn),
wvhich it needs for its own use.
It is this exchange of impurities for oxygen, that changes the dark, blue bloofd-that
was sent to the lungs from one side of the
heart, to the bright red blood that is ready
to nourish the body, and is returned to the
other side of the heart, from  which it is
sent out by the arteries.
This work goes on all the time, whether we
114are awake or asleep, and without our thought.
If, in order to breathe, we had to think
about it, we should have little time for
any thing else; and if we forgot it, and so
stopped breathing, we should soon die.
HOW TO BREATHE.
Air should enter the lungs through the
nose instead of through the mouth. Even
when running, if possible, keep the mouth
closed. Fewer impurities will pass into the
lungs by so doing, and in cold weather the
air is slightly warmed before reaching them,
making one less likely to "take cold."
Sometimes, as in running, the heart beats
so rapidly that the lungs can not keep up
with it and supply air enough for the blood;
then we are "out of breath."
HYGIENE OF BREATHING.
As the muscular walls of the chest and
abdomen help in the act of breathing, nothing should prevent their free movement.
For this reason, garments worn about the
waist, such as corsets and belts, should rSevel
115be tight.  They are sure to do harm  by
crowding the lungs, thus partly stopping the
breath, and by pressing out of place the organs of the abdomen.

In this way the liver and the stomach have been forced downward, as seen in the
cut.
Among the many causes pf consumption is
tight lacing. A small, pinched waist shows
that its owner is either ignorant or foolishperhaps both.
116The weight of the clothing should not
rest on the hips, pressing the muscles of the
abdomen, but be held by shoulder-straps, or
by waists, kept up by shoulder-straps. Round
shoulders, by pressing the lungs out of their
proper position, are friends of consumption.
DISEASES.
Bronchitis (br6n ki'tls) is a disease of the
bronchial tubes, pleurisy (pla'rI sO) of the
pleura, the soft skin. covering the lungs;
pneumonia (na mo' nI ) and consumption affect,
the lungs themselves, and croup is a disease
of the larynx and windpipe.
All these dangers may be largely avoided
by wearing sufficient clothing, by being careful not to "take cold," by eating proper food,
and by living in houses that are dry, clean,
light, well-warmed, and well-aired, and built
in healthy places.
VENTILATION4+
Ventilation is the removal of impure or
poisoned air from buildings and the supplying of fresh air in its place.
117CAUSES OF IMPURE AIR.
In a pleasant village, a few years ago,
stood a large house, of which people were
afraid, because all who tried to live there
sickened, and some of them died.
But one day, a stranger looked over the
grounds and house, then bought the estate
and ordered repairs; when these were finished, his family moved in, and were healthy
and happy there.
The secret of the change lay in the owner's knowledge of the laws of health. IIe
provided a supply of pure water for family
use, to take the place of that from the old
well into which the drainage soaked. Decaying vegetables, old boards, ancient brooms,
and' other rubbish in various stages of slimy
rottenness, were cleared out of the cellar,
from which they had been sending poisonous gases through the house.
A long drain was built to carry the dishwater out into the garden; and refuse matter from  the table, such as broken bits of
meat and skins of fruit and vegetables, was
118burned in the kitchen range, not thrown
out at the back door and left to decay.
The neighbors no longer feared the house,
but followed the example of its new owner.
Gravel and concrete paths and sidewalks replaced those of decaying boards, and piles
of old saw-dust from the sheds went to feed
furnace fires.
At last, typhoid fever, diphtheria, and malaria, almost disappeared from that locality,
because their causes were so largely removed.
Remember that air which contains decaying animal and vegetable matter, is not fit
to breathe; and that water, under the same
conditions, is not fit to drink. It is well
that winds blow poisonous gases away, that
the falling rains wash the air clean, and that
plants live on carbonic acid which, in sufficient quantity, is fatal to animal life.
VENTILATION OF BUILDINGS.
Waste matter from  the body is always
passing off by means of the skin and lungs;
fires, whether for lighting or heating,. send
out carbonic acid; sweeping and the tread
119of feet set free dust and bits of wool from
the carpets.
iUfnless great pains are taken to keep the
air in our houses, school-rooms, halls, and
churches, fit f'or breathing, we poison ourselves.
Janitors of churches, school-rooms, and
other public buildings, should never close
doors and windows, as soon as an'audience
has passed out, and shut up the poisoned air
to be' jreUhed over again the next time the
room is used.
The air in such rooms in cold weather is
really carbonic acid gas and other impurities
"warmed over."  Doors and windows should
be opened on opposite sides, until the fresh
air has taken the place of that in the room.
No lesson, sermon, lecture, or concert, can
be understoo( or enjoyed by a sleepy, heedless audience-sleepy and heedless because of
the poisoned air it has taken into its lungs.
The headache which we so often have in
ill-ventilated rooms, is the common result of
re-breathing carbonic acid and other impurities. Thus we see that good studying, preach120ing, and teaching, as well as good health, are
dependent on good air.
Special care should be taken in the ventilation of sleeping-roorrs.  Leave a close
room in which you have spent the niglht, for
a brisk walk in the open air-then return to
it again.
The air is foul with the heavy, suffocating
odor of waste matter, the product of your
lungs, which you have been breathing over
and over again during your sleeping hours.
You felt stupid and tired on waking, because
poisoned by your own breath.
Sleeping-rooms should be so ventilated in
the winter, as well as in the summer, that
the sleeper may have a constant supply of
moderately warm, fresh air. This can be done
by raising the lower and dropping the upper
sash of a window in a warm room.
Cold air is not necessarily pure air, and, in
northern climates, is often too severe in winter to be breathed at night by any but the
most robust.
Two openings are needed in order to ventilate a room properly-one through which.121the impure air may pass out, and another by
which the pure air may enter.
There are many ways of doing this. One
is to open the windows a little, both at the
top and bottom, as already suggested. Open
fire-places are excellent ventilators. Through
them, a stream of air from the room goes up
the chimney, and air from  without must
come in to take its place.
While we must have fresh air to breathe,
it is not safe to sit or stand in a draught of
air.
AIR IN SICK-ROOMS.
The air of the sick-room should be always
pure and fresh. To "take the breath" of
another person is, of course, to take the carbonic acid and other waste matter from his
lungs into your own. Contagious diseases are
often spread in this way.
ALCOHOL AND THE LUNGS.
Alcohol, as you have learned, is sent into
the blood as soon as possible. The blood carries a part to the lungs, and thus you may
122often know from  the breath that a person
has been drinking.
In  passing  through  them, alcohol injures
the delicate air-cells of the lungs. The idea
that this narcotic will prevent consumption
is a mistake. There is one form of this disease, called alcoholic consumption, which is
caused by alcohol.*
The drinker looks well and feels well, till
suddenly comes a "dropped stitch," or a pain
in the side. Then follow difficulty of breathing and vomiting of blood; then a rapid passage to the grave; for medicine, food, change
of air, all prove useless.
* Dr. A. B. Palmer says in a recent work, "Science and Practice
of Medicine":-" An impression seems to have obtained a footing in
this country, that the use of alcohol, even in excessive quantities,
tends to prevent consumption.
"The origin of this opinion it is not easy to discover. It was not
imported from Europe; for, so far as I have been able to ascertain,
it is not held there by any respectable authority. It is not sustained by any authenticated statistics with which I am acquainted.
"Dr. Peacock, one of the oldest and most highly esteemed specialists in lung diseases in London, and Physician to Victoria Park
Hospital for Consumptives, when told of the American notion of
the preventive power of alcohol in consumption, and asked whether
he thought it prevented the disease, replied, that so far from it, it
was a fruitful cause of a certain form of the disease."
Dr. Palmer adds, "Too many persons have been made drtinkards
from the notion that whiskey prevents consumption, to make the
view of its bearings upon morals and intemperance a matter of
indifference to the conscientious physician."
123Proper food is wrought into our bodies;
but poisons* are thrown out of them, if possible, because  unfit to  be  used  in  making
any of their parts.
In large doses, in its pure state, or when
diluted, as in brandy, whiskey, rum, or gin,
alcohol is often fatal to life. Deaths of men,
women, and children from poisonous doses of
this drug, are common.
In  smaller  quantities,  or  in  the  lighter
liquors-beer, wine, and  cider-when  used  as
a beverage, it injures the health in proportion to the amount taken.
WHAT IS A NARCOTIC?
Any substance that deadens the brain and
nerves is called a narcotic; for example, ether
(e'th6r) and  chloroform  (ellC'ro f6rm), which  are
given by the dentist, that he may extract
Dr. Alden, of Massachusetts, tells us:  "On every organ they
touch, alcoholic drinks act as a poison. There is no such thing
as their temperate use. They are always an enemy to the human
body. They produce weakness, not strength; sickness, not health;
death, not life."
* Intoxicated means poisoned. The barbarians poisoned their arrows; hence, from the Latin in, into- and toxicumrn, a poison into
which arrows were dipped, we get the word which describes the
condition of a person under the influence of alcohol.
i iAlcohol injures muscular power, and, as
the diaphragm and the muscles which move
the ribs are used  in  breathing, respiration  is
often imperfect in those who drink. Sometimes, these muscles are so affected that
paralysis or death occurs. Life depends on
respiration,  and  liquors  are  the   enemy  of
healthy breathing.

~i.-'"/~~CIRCULATION.
THE  BLOOD.
HE blood is a thin, watery liquid in
which  float  millions  of  little  round
blood-disks.  As most of these  are red, the
blood looks red.
Fia. 22.

A, blood-disks of human blood, highly magnified; B, blood disks in the blood of an
animal.
A  French  writer says:  "You  feel quite
sure that blood  is red, do you  not?   Well,
it is no more red than the water of a stream
would be, if you were to fill it with little
red fishes."Suppose the fishes to be very, very small,
as small as a grain of sand, and closely
crowded together through the whole depth
of the stream, the water would look red,
would it not? And this i the way in which
the blood looks red. Only observe one thing
-a grain of sand is a mountain in comparison with the little red bodies which float in
the blood.
"In a single drop of blood, such as might
hang on the point of a needle, there are
millions of these bodies."
CLOTTING OF THE BLOOD.
This rarely occurs in ttre living blood inside:the vessels. But when blood is taken
from the body and allowed to stand awhile,
the disks sink to the bottom and the watery
liquid floats on the top.
If the flesh is slightly cut anywhere, and
the blood flows--as it will, so numerous are
the blood-vessels-a clot soon forms at the
mouths of the vessels and stops the flow.
This clot is really a little plug formed by
the separation of the parts of the blood.

127naked eye, called capillaries.  So very fine are
these that the blood-disks have to go through
them in single file.
THE  HEART.
The heart is a strong, muscular bag, inll
shape and size somewhat like a very large
pear. Around it is a loose bag of connectivetissue.
The heart is divided lengthwise, by a partition calledl the septum (sep'tiAm), into right
and left halves. Each half is divided crosswise
into chambers which open into each other.
The upper chambers are called the right
and left auricles (.a.'r els); the lower chambers, the right and left ventricles (v6n'tri ls).
As the blood can not pass through the septum, the heart is really a double organ.
MOTIONS OF THE HEART.
The muscular fibers of the heart are so
arranged as to contract the two auricles at
the same time. The blood is thus sent into
the ventricles, which, in their turn, contract
together and so send the blood from the heart.128COURSE OF THE BLOOD.
The walls of the auricl].es are much thinner than those of the venltricles, since they
have to send the blood so short a distance,
that but little strength is needed.
COURSE OF THE BLOOD.
We may think of the heart as an engine
which pumps the blood all through the body.
FIG. 24.
A               B      a
Circtlation of tbhe blood in the web qf a frog's foot, highly magnified. A, an'
artery; B, calillaies crowded with dis8k; C, a deeper vein.  The black spots ard
coloring matter in ceds.
The bright, pure blood is pumped  out from
the left side through a large artery, called
the aorta (a 6r' ta).
An express wagon, you know, carries different kinds of goods.  It may have machinery for a mill, a package of money for thebank, a silk dress for your mother, or a bicycle (bi'9J e11) for you. The express-man takes
each thing to the right place, leaves it there,
and then drives away.
So the blood passing from the large artery
into the smaller ones, and then into the
capillaries, leaves one kind of substance with
the bones, another with the muscles, and.
still another with the skin.
If, by the right kind of eating, drinking,
breathing, and other care, we have put proper
materials into our blood, it will, in its course
through the body, leave what each part needs
for its work in keeping us strong and well.
Sometimes,- when the express-man leaves a
box at a house, he takes away at the same
time, a package, or a trunk, for another place.
The blood does this, too; but the material
which the blood takes away from the different parts, is worn-out or useless matter. that
must be made over or sent out of the body.
The tiny veins that join the capillaries
&gt;unite, till at last they form two great veins
which bring the blood back to the right
auricle of the heart.
130By the time it reaches the veins, it carries such a load of waste matter that it is
of a dark blue color, as seen in the bloodvessels of the wrist. After eating, newlydigested food forms a part of this venous
blood. Sent from the right auricle into the
right ventricle, it is then hu-rried to the lungs.
There the wonderful change takes place
which you learned about in studying respiration. The waste matter, largely carbonic
acid, is sent off with the breath, and oxygen
takes its place. The blood becomes bright
scarlet again, and fit to nourish the body.
The veins then carry it to the left auricle
and it starts on another journey through
the system. It travels so rapidly, as to get
back to the heart in less than thirty seconds.
From two quarts to a gallon of blood, pass
through a man's heart every minute.
The walls of the left ventricle are much
thicker and stronger than those of the right,
because they have to contract with force
enough to send the blood through the body,
while the right ventricle sends it only to
the lungs.
131teeth without pain. Alcohol is taken for
similar purposes, and is a powerful narcotic.
ALCOHOL AND WATER.
Into a bottle half full of water, pour alcohol to the top; then shake it well, being very
careful not to spill any of the liquid. Now,
the bottle is not full. The alcohol has mixed
with  the  water, and it does this wherever it
has a chance.
Oil and water will not unite; alcohol and
water will always unite.
In our study of the human body, which
is seven  parts out of eight, water,*  we shall
see how alcohol, beginning at the lips, unites
with the water in every part of the drinker's
body which it reaches, thus robbing it of the
needed  liquid.
* I took one of those remains of the human body which have
been preserved some thousands of years, and which is called an
Egyptian mummy.
It was probably the body of one who had been a great priest
or ruler; for it had been embalmed or preserved in the most expensive form  of embalming and had been inclosed in a tomb
which must have cost a small fortune.
I measured the mummy,-its length, its girth, and the relative
size of its head and limbs and trunk. From these measurements
I was able to estimate what would have been the weight of the
12This, then, is the course of the blood:

of the body.

the body, is called circulation (.ir eQ l1'tion).

placed in the heart and
veins, that if the blood tries to move in the
wrong direction, the back-flow is prevented
by the shutting of the valves across the passage-ways or tubes.
Brisk exercise of any kind makes the
blood flow faster, and thus increases the
warmth of the body.
The teamster swings his arms and rubs
his hands together in cold weather, because
his blood, being chilled, is moving slowly,
and he must quicken its flow.
132The heat one feels after taking brisk
exercise, is more natural and more healthful
than that which'is obtained from nearness
to a warm fire.
THE PULSE.
In adults, the blood is sent out from the
heart about seventy times a minute; in children, from eighty to ninety times a minute.
Most of the arteries lie deep in the flesh;
but, at the wrist and the temple, they are^
so near the surface that you can feel the
pulse, or the motion of the blood as it is
sent through the arteries by the "beating"
of the heart.
IUsually, if the pulse is much faster or
slower than the average rate, the person is
sick; the doctor counts the pulse of a patient,
so as to know how his heart is working.
Rest is as necessary for the heart as for
other muscles. To secure it, there is a slight
pause between the beats. Brief as each pause
is, if all these moments are added together,
they make about nine hours of rest during
the twenty-four.
133'WORK OF THE HEART.
At every beat, the heart moves about four
ounces of blood.
Suppose you had a machine which could
lift very heavy weights. The coal-man brings
you a ton of coal, and you put it into a large
box, fasten the box to the machine, turn a
crank, and the strong arm of your machine
swings the box of coal up into the air with
perfect ease.
You try a heavier weight-say twentyfive tons; this also is lifted easily, but not
so high as before. Try fifty tons and then
seventy-five; the heavier the weight of coal,
the less will be the height to which your
machine will raise it.
At last, you try one hundred twenty-two
tons: the machine can lift this heavy load
only one foot from the ground; there it
stops, for there is not power enough to raise
it any higher.
The heart of a full-grown man or woman
uses as much power in moving blood for
twenty-four hours, as your machine would
134use in lifting one hundred twenty-two tons,
one foot high.
This is what learned men mean when
they say: "The daily work of the healthy
heart in an adult, is equal to lifting one hundred and twenty-two tons, one foot."
CUTS AND WOUNDS.
The blood in the arteries of the limbs is
pure and fresh, and in rapid motion; in the
veins, it is impure and moves slowly.
The arteries, being deep set, are not easily
injured; but, if bright, red blood comes in
jerks from a cut or wound, you may know
that one is severed. Send for a surgeon at
once, but do something while waiting for
him; for there is great danger that the sufferer will bleed to death.
Even a child may save a person's life at
such a time, if he knows what to do. The
flow of blood must be stopped by pinching the
artery, as you would stop the flow of water
in a rubber hose.
If possible, take a handkerchief, or a towel,
or any convenient bandage, and tie it around
135the limb close to the wound, and between
the wound and the heart. Put a stick into
the knot and twist it round and round, just
enough to stop the bleeding by pressing the
artery.
This will check the rush of blood coming,
you remember, from  the heart, and enable
it to form a clot at the cut end of the tube.
Keep the limb raised as you work.
If the blood comes in a slow, steady
stream, a vein is injured. The blood in the
veins is going to the heart, you know, and
is moving much more slowly than that in
the-arteries. A clot will usually form in the
cut veins without the help of a bandage.
If you can not use the bandage, or if this
does not stop the bleeding, press a handful
of dry earth upon the wound and hold it
there until help comes; this is a "remedy
that has saved many a life upon the battlefield."
ALCOHOL' AND THE BLOOD.
Often the blood is made thin by the enor.
mous quantities of water, or of beer, which
136are drunk, because of the burning thirst
caused by alcohol. In case of a severe wound,
the blood, when it is in such a condition, does
not readily clot, and there is greater danger
of bleeding to death. While alcohol is in
the blood, it acts injuriously upon the vitality
of the blood-disks, and, when in great excess,
may cause them to shrink.
ALCOHOL AND THE BLOOD-VESSELS.
The motionl of the heart is controlled by
the nerves, about which you will learn in a
later lesson. Wherever you find blood-vessels
-even the tiniest capillaries-there are nerves
entering into their coats and controlling
them.
When in a healthy condition, they keep
the blood-vessels from  stretching or shrinking, so as to hold too much or too little blood,
But, if a person drinks gin, whiskey, wine,
cider, or any thing containing alcohol, these
nerves are at once deadened by this narcotic;
they fail to do their work properly, and
therefore the elastic walls of the capillaries
stretch, letting in too much blood.This is often seen in the flushed face, especially in the red, blotched nose, of a drinking man. The unusual amount of blood in the
capillaries shows its color through the skin.
This is a pitiful sight, especially when we
remember that alcohol affects in a similar
way, the capillaries of the brain, stomach,
and other parts of the body.
ALCOHOL AND THE HEART.
The pendulum  regulates the works of a
clock, keeping them in motion at the proper
rate; remove it, and they "run down," at
once. So there are certain nerves which
cause the heart to beat, and others which,
like the pendulum of a clock, keep it.from
moving too rapidly.
Alcohol affects the heart, by acting mainly
on, this last set of nerves which serve as its
"brakes."  This, like many other of the:
truths you are learning, has been discovered
by experiments on, the lower animals and on
man.
When these nerves are deadened, the heart'
beats quicker, but its power is decreased, and
ithe pulsations are too feeble to send out the
blood properly. The rapid working shortens
its times of rest, and heart disease is often
the result.
TOBACCO AND THE HEART.
The effect of tobacco on the heart is much
the same as that of alcohol. The beat is
quickened, but the power is weakened: severe pain around the heart is a common result of smoking. There is a form of disease -
of this organ, which the doctors call "tobacco
heart."

CUTIS AND CUTICLE.
HE skin has two layers. The lower one
is called the cutis (*ea tis), or true skin;
the upper one, the cuticle (ec' tU el). These
layers never interfere with muscular motion;
for they cover the flesh more nicely thanthe finest glove fits the hand.
At the lips and nose, this covering changes
to a softer and more delicate one, called th:..
mucous membrane'(mm'bran), which extends
into the body and forms the lining of most
of its organs.
THE CUTI S.
The inner, or true skin, is full of nerves
and blood-vessels; it has, also, weak muscular
fibers, by means of which the skin is sometimes "puckered" into "goose-pimples," or
the hair made to "stand on end."ALCOHOLIC APPETITE.
ALCOHOLIC APPETITE.
Like all narcotic poisons, alcohol has the
fatal power of creating an increasing appetite for itself, that demands not only more
frequent, but stronger and larger doses. The
greater its work of ruin, the harder and
more nearly impossible to overcome, will be
its demand.
The appetite does not gain with equal rapidity  upon  all; but  no  one  can  tell how
body when its owner was moving on the earth in the midst of
life and health. The weight of the body at that time, I reckoned,'
would have been 128 pounds.
In the condition of a mummy, in which it was now before me,
nothing remained but the dried skeleton or bony framework, and
the muscles and other organs completely dried. The body, in fact,
had, in the course of ages, lost all its water.
In this state it weighed just sixteen pounds, and, as eight times
sixteen are one hundred and twenty-eight, it is clear that.seven
parts out of eight of the whole body, or one hundred and twelve
pounds, had passed away as water. In the remaining weight was
included that of the skeleton, which contains but ten per cent. of
water, and some mere remnants of canvas and pitchy substances,
which had been used by the embalmers, and which, like the skeleton, still continued perfect.
The soft parts of this human body, by which all its active life,
its moving and thinking functions, had been carried on, were, in
fact, nearly all removed by the drying process, or loss of water, to
which they had been subjected. They had not been destroyed by
passing into new forms of matter, as occurs when a dead substance
is allowed to decay in the open air; but they had completely lost
the water which once gave them size, flexibility, shape, and capacity for motion.
Dr. B. W. Rchard8on, of London,On the palm  of your hand and the ends of
your fingers, you can see little ridges called
papillae (pa pll'l).  These contain so many of
the tiny nerves by which lews is carried to

THE CUTICLE.

severe as the toothache.

by use, as on the hands of a blacksmith, or
on the feet of a barefoot boy. Its scales rub
142off on our under-clothing and on the sheets
of our beds. In a blister, bloody or watery
matter forces itself between the two layers
of the skin.
THE PERSPIRATION.
When a workman comes in from the hayfield on a hot August day, his face is covered
with drops of water; so is yours after a run,
and you say, you are "sweaty."
This sweat, or perspiration, is a part of the
waste matter which must be sent out of the
body. It oozes through very small holes in
the skin, called pores-so small that you ban
not see them  without a magnifying glass.
They are the mouths of small tubes that extend through the skin, the lower end of
each being coiled into a tiny ball.
They are most numerous in the soles of
the feet, the arm-pits, the palms of -the
hands, and the forehead. If all these drains
of the body were straightened out and laid
end. to end, they would make a line more
than three miles long.
Perspiration is at all times passing off
143through the pores; but we notice it only
when there is enough to form drops. It
cools the body, and suddenly to stop perspiring is one of the first symptoms of heatstroke or sun-stroke.
Mixed with the water of the sweat is
waste matter from  the body.  The skin is
thus one of our most important scavengers,
and garments which prevent the perspiration
from passing away into the air, are not
healthful; the feet become damp and cold,
if rubber overshoes, which keep in the moisture, are worn for any great length of time.
-A little boy was once covered with goldleaf to represent an angel in a festival. This
kept the perspiration from leaving his body,
and be died in a few hours.
THE OIL-GLANDS.
The skin is kept smooth and soft by an
oily substance sent out from  little sacs in
the cutis, called oil-glands.  A similar oily
material moistens- and keeps the hair glossy.
The oil or sebaceous (se bi'shts) glands are
quite large on the face, and sometimes the
144matter in them  hardens and dries. When
their mouths aIe open, particles of dirt mingle with the oily matter, and they become
dark-colored and are often called "worms."
They can then be easily pressed out and the
black spots removed.
COMPLEXION.
Small grains of coloring-matter on the
lower side of the cuticle, cause the different
colors of the skin.  When these collect in
spots, the skin is freckled.
THE HAIR AND NAILS.
These grow from the cuticle. Each hair
has a tiny sac, or fold of skin, at its root.
The nails protect the ends of the fingers, and
grow rapidly.
You may easily prove this, by making a
little mark near the base of one of them,
and watching it from day to day.
The nails should always be kept clean and
well-cut; not bitten nor broken off. Fingernails, black with needless dirt under the ends,
are not the mark of a gentleman or a lady.
145BATH ING.
The sweat-tubes will not work properly
if dirt is allowed to clog or close the openings.  Bathing, therefore, is very necessary
to the health of the body.
For most strong, well persons, the best
time for a bath is just after rising. The
water used may be cold, or slightly warm.
If hot water is used, a dash of cold water
at the close of the bath, with vigorous rubbing, will prevent the tired feeling that
would otherwise follow.
Cold water drives the blood away from
the skin for an instant; but it comes back
when the surface is briskly rubbed, giving
a delightful warmth and glow to the body.
A healthy person need not be at all chilled
by a cold bath. Uncover only a small part
of the body at a time, and wash rapidly and
rub well with a coarse towel. If the bath
is thus taken, and each part covered as soon
as it is dry and warm, no chill will be felt.
All should bathe at least twice a week,
and soap is needed on the whole body at
146DISEASES TAKEN BY THE SKIN.
least once a week, to remove the oily matter
that has dried upon the skin.
The old idea that it must not be used upon
the face is a mere whim. When needed for
cleanliness, use it on the face as freely as on
any other part of the body.
DISEASES TAKEN BY THE SKIN.
There is danger in using many of the
cheap toilet soaps, since they are sometimes
made from the fat of diseased animals, and
diseases may thus be taken into the system
through the pores of the skin.
Soldiers who want to shirk duty, sometimes put a piece of tobacco under each armpit. The poison passing through the pores
soon sickens them, and the surgeon sends
them to the hospital.
Painters and operatives in lead works, are
often made sick by little particles of the
lead which they handle, entering the pores
and poisoning the blood.
Face-powders, hair-dyes, and eye-washes,
do great harm in the same way. Good
health is the best cosmetic (e6!_m_t'ie). Nothing else will give such a clear complexion,
rosy cheeks, and briilliant eyes. Beauty is
much more than  "skin-deep."
THE SUN.
Sunlight is necessary for the health of
the skin, as well as for all the other parts
of the body. In many homes, the closed
blinds that keep the carpets bright, keep the
people who live behind them, faded and pale.
The trees around  a house often shade it
so heavily that it is dark and damp. Plants
growing in cellars have white, sickly leaves;
people living in the dark, lose strength of
body and mind, as well as color.
The sunlight should not be shut out from
rooms occupied by human beings, except in
times of extreme heat.

148ANIMAL  HEAT.
USE OF THE THERMOMETER.'HE blood in the healthy human body has
an average heat of 980; that is, if you
should put a thermometer (thOr m6m' et8r) into
it as it rushes through its network of tubes,
the mercury would rise as high as it does
in the shade on a hot summer day.
This result can not, of course, be arrived
at directly; but the blood-vessels come so
near the surface that a thermometer held in
the mouth or in the arm-pit for a few minutes, will show the temperature within the
body. Summer or winter, arctic cold or torrid heat, make but little difference in the
internal warmth, so long as one is well.
If there is much change in the heat of
the body, it is a sign of danger; in fevers,
for instance, the doctor keeps careful watchof the internal heat of the patient's bodyif it gets above a certain point, there is no
hope of recovery.
But this heat is constantly passing off
through the lungs, skin, and other organs.
The average amount lost in a day of rest
would boil about sixty pounds of ice-water:
in a day of work, about eighty pounds.
This loss must be balanced by, gain.
SOURCES OF HEAT.
The heat of the body results from the
many changes constantly going on within it.
The changes which take place in the digestion of food and in the tissues, the beating of the heart, the motion of the blood,
the movements of the food-canal, the contracting of the muscles-all the processes of
the body, tend to make and preserve its heat.
C LOTH ING.
Woolen under-garments should be worn in
the winter in northern climates, and many
persons require them all the year.
Men who work in very hot places, such
150as foundries and engine-rooms, find flannel
shirts more comfortable than cotton ones; for
they protect from the heat of the fire and
do not so readily get wet with perspiration
and then allow the body to become chilly.
Loose clothing in several layers is warmer
than tight and very thick clothing. The
feet and lower limbs of children, in these
days of short pants and short dresses, should
be clothed with care; thick boots and wvoolen
stockings are necessary for their health and
comfort, during more than half the year.
A wise doctor often said to his patients:
"Never allow yourselves to feel cold. If you
are chilly, put on extra: clothing, go to a
warmer room, exercise briskly, in some way
get warm and keep warm." "Only fools and
beggars suufer from the cold; the latter not
being able to get sufficient clothes, the others not having the sense to wear them."
Tight clothing chills by checking the circulation.  Keeping the body too warm  by
overheated rooms or too much clothing, is
another extreme which should be avoided.
None of the under-garments worn during
151
CLOTHING.long he will be satisfied with a little. This
craving, so  easily formed, and  so hard  to
overcome, clings to its victims.  Sometimes
after slumbering through years of abstinence
(Ab'sti n6n~), it is wakened by the first taste.
The custom of putting wine and other
alcoholic liquors into cooked foods, is a dangerous one, often causing the formation *or
return of a fearful appetite.  The narcotic, or
deadening, effect of alcohol upon the nerves,
unfits the drinker to realize his peril; therefore its use, even in small quantities, is a
dangerous venture to the user.
-In t,his country, over 60,000 persons every
year die as drunkards-that is, are killed by
alcohol. None of them expected to become
drunkards when they began to drink liquor;
but they were ignorant, or careless, of the
power of a little alcohol to create an appetite for more.

14the day, should be kept on at night, because
waste matter from the perspiration, and
scales of the cuticle, have collected upon
them; they should be taken off and spread
out so as to be thoroughly aired for next day.
Outer clothing removed at night should
not be hung in closed closets or wardrobes;
there is more or less perspiration on it, and
this should have a chance to escape. Be sure
that closets and wardrobes are often aired.
In the morning, throw the bed wide open,
and, if possible, give the sheets and nightclothes a good sun bath. A wise housewife
will not have beds made early; but will let
them remain open until noon, or even night.
The family will be gainers in the fresh,
sweet sleep taken in beds that have been
freed from foul matter by the air and sun.
Night-clothes should be hung up exposed
to the air when the bed is made, instead of
being placed under the pillow.
TAKING COLD.
By exposure to a draught of air when one
is heated, by sitting with wet feet or in damp
152garments, by going into cold air without extra clothing-ill these and many other ways,
the skin is suddenly chilled. The numberless little pores at once close, and the waste
matter can not pass away through them.
It often tries to escape by way of the
inner skin-the mucous membrane of the
mouth and nose--or by way of the lungs.
Then we have a "cold in the head " or "on
the lungs," which may lead to more serious
trouble if not attended to at once.
One may guard against "taking cold" by
bathing the body often, and by rubbing it
daily with a flesh-brush or a' coarse towel,
thus keeping the pores of the skin in good
working order.
ALCOHOL AND COLD.
"Bitter cold! must take something to
warm me up," cries the driver starting on a
long winter ride. So he swallows a glass ot
whiskey; says, "That's the drink to warm a
man; " ancl drives away. But is he warmer?
Alcohol is a cheat here as elsevwhere. The
nerves being paralyzed, the capillaries en153large, and an increased current of blood pours
into those of the skin. This makes a glow
at the surface of the body, and the man is
sure he is warmer, because he feels warmer.
The heat of this warm blood at once passes
off from the surface, and soon more than the
proper amount of heat has left the body.
Try the thermometer-that is a better test
than the feelings; it shows that the body is
really colder very soon after the alcohol has
entered it. But the deadened nerves can not
carry the message, or sense of cold, to the
brain, and no effort is made to prevent being
chilled, for the man does not know he is
cold. This is the first step toward death, and
many a drunkard has been frozen to death
when too much intoxicated to feel his danger.
When something must be taken to start
again the slow moving wheels of life -as,
when one is nearly frozen to death--a little
red pepper in hot water is an excellent remedy. Clear hot water, hot coffee, or ginger
tea, a few drops of ammonia in water, or ammonia (not too strong) held to the nostrils,
are also valuable helps in such an- emergency.
154Arctic explorers have proved that alcohol
is worse t.han useless in helping them  bear
extreme cold. Dr. McRae says: "The moment
that a man had swallowed a drink of spirits,
it was certain that his day's work was nearly
at an end.            In that terrific cold,
the use of liquor as a beverage, when we had
work on hand, was out of the question."
Until lately, the explorer who had gone
nearest to the north pole was an Englishman named Adam Ayles. He was proud of
being able to say there had never been a drop
of alcohol in his body. When in the extreme
cold of those regions, he bore the hard work
of: sledging and hunting much better than
the men who used liquor now and then.
Many of those who drank liquor became
sick and helpless. When urged to drink
liquor, Adam  Ayles replied bravely:. "No!
when a boy, I promised my mother never to
touch it; and, if I perish in this ice, I will
keep my word."  He returned to England
alive and well.
When a detachment of the ~Russian army
is about to start on a winter expedition, a
155,corporal goes the rounds to smell the breath
of each soldier. Those who have been drinking liquor are sent back to their barracks,
since they can not endure the cold march.
ALCOHOL AND HEAT.
Alcohol is no better protection against
heat than against cold. Livingstone, the famous African explorer, has proved that men
can endure more in tropical climates without it than  with  it.

156ALCOHOL AND LIFE.
INSURANCE.
tIOSE who never drink liquor have a prospect of living much longer than those
who do. Many diseases are caused by alcohol, and many more are made worse by it.
Of diseases like the cholera and yellow
fever, pure air, clean houses and streets, and
blood unpoisoned by alcohol and tobacco, are
the best preventives.
In one season in New. Orleans, 5,000 drinking men died of yellow fever, before the disease touched a sober man; the poisoned
bodies of the alcohol-users could not resist
the disease.
Life insurance  companies keep  careful
records, showing'how -many years different
classes of men will probably live. Here are
some of the results of their study in England:When a total abstainer is
20 years old, he may expect to live 44 years more.
30  "... "  "  "    " "  36.5  "   "
40  "   " "  "        "   " "  28.8  "   "
When a moderate drinker is
20 years old, he may expect to live 15.5 years more.
30  i"  "  c  "    cc   "  " 13.8  "    "
40  "   "  "  "    "' 1.6  "    "
From  these records, it is plain that those
who never drink liquor have the best chance
for length of life, as well as for happiness
and power to work.
The President of one life insurance company in New England says of beer-drinkers:
"The deaths among them were astounding.
Robust health, full muscles, a fair outside, increasing weight, florid faces, then a touch of
disease and quick death.
"It was as if the system  had been kept;
fair outside, while within, it'was eaten to a
shell, and at the first touch there was utter
collapse; every fiber was poisoned and weak.......  Beer-drinking is very deceptive, at
first; it is thoroughly destructive, at last."
Some companies will not insure the lives158of liquor-sellers, because they know that they
are so often liquor-drinkers.
HERE D ITY.
You have learned enough about your body
by this time, to understand that when people
are sick, it is generally their own fault;
either they have not been taught how to
care for their bodies, or they are heedless in
spite of their knowledge.
But sometimes, one is sick or suffers very
much, because of wrong things that his
parents or grand-parents did. Does this seem
strange? Some one has told you, perhaps,
that you have your father's hair and eyes,
but that your mouth and chin are like your
mother's.
You have heard of children who were
quick-tempered, or generous like their parents. Not only property, but faces and character are inherited.  Our lives are very
closely linked with those of our "blood relations," andl evil tendencies, as well as good
impulses, descend from them to us.
Over in the poor-house, is a man who doesnot know so much as most children four
years old. He can not learn to read or write;
he is an idiot. And this is because he is
the child of drinking parents whose poisoned
life blood  tainted  his own.
Many men and wolnen are insane, because
they inherit disordered bodies and minds,
caused by the drinking habits of their parents; and  the descendants of  "moderate
drinkers" suffer in this way, as well as those
of the drunkard.*
Some lnen of great self-control may use a
moderate amount of alcoholic liquors through
a  long  life,  without  apparent  injury.   But
their children are likely to inherit a stronger
appetite  for narcotics and a weaker will with
which to control it.
* One of the most serious objections to the use of alcoholic liquors
in any quantity, is the taste it creates, the habit it establishes--a
taste and habit often transmitted from parents to their children--
and the very great.danger, by continuance in the indulgence, of
its resulting in gross, degrading, habitual drunkenness.
Even if a moderate indulgence had no other evil effect, this
danger is so great, and the influence of the example on others is so
bad, as to cause every wise and good man, woman, or child, to
avoid it altogether.
Every body knows it does incalculable harm, and if it does
no positive good, there is the best possible reason for "total
abstinence."--Dr. A. B. Panmer.
160Tobacco and opium produce similar results. This is called the law of heredity*
(her6d'l ti). It is one of God's laws, and, like
just earthly laws, helps right living and
punishes those who  disobey it.
The English-speaking races have descended
from men who were hard drinkers. Our ancestors, the old Northmen, were famous for
their wild  feasts, at which  they  drank  immnense quantities of mead-a fermented liquor
made from honey and milk. In the early
* "Three-fourths of the idiots born are the children of intemperate parents."-Dr. Howe.
"Where drinking has been strong in both parents, I think it a
physical certainty that it will be traced in the children."-Dr. ARtie.
" One more example which has come under my own professional
observation, may be useful. A gentleman of position, sixty-four
years of age, is an hereditary drunkard. So violent is he that his
wife and family had to leave him.
"One of his sisters has lost her mind through drinking. When
drunk, she has frequently tried to commit suicide by jumping
from a window, and by drowning. Her insanity has so suicidal
a tendency that she can not be left for a moment alone. She will
do any thing for drink--will beg, borrow, or steal, pawn everything she can lay her hands on, and even essay robbery with violence in the hope of obtaining money to gratify her morbid craving for alcohol.
"Another sister is also an habitual drunkard, who gets into
fits of ungovernable fury. when in drink, and is dangerous both
to herself and to others.
"The fatal legacy in this case was from both parents. The
father shot himself when insane from the use of alcohol, and the
mother was a drunkard. The grandfather was also a confirmed
inebriate."-Norman Kerr, M.,)D.
161FERMENTATION.
JuH  HAT is fer men ta'tion?  When moist
animal or vegetable matters are exposed to warm air, certain changes which
take place alter their nature; these changes
are produced by a process called fermentation.
When sugar is turning to alcohol and
carbon'ic ac'id, the latter escapes in little
bubbles, giving the entire liquid the appearance of boiling. We call this process, and
others much like it, fermentation, from  a
Latin word which means to boil.
There are several kinds of fermentation.
In these lessons we shall learn about only
two of them.
I. Vi'nous Fermentation--the change of sugar
to alcohol and carbonic acid.
II. A ce'tous Fermentation-the change of alcohol and other substances to vinegar.days of the English nation, wine and ale
were every-where used.
In America, only a few years ago, cider
and ruin were found in the cellar and -on
the table of nearly every farmer; and no
wedding, funeral, or public gathering of any
sort, was without its free liquor.
The ignorance of that time in regard to
the origin, nature, and donsequences of alcohol, is shown by the fact that the first temperance pledges signed in this country, prohibited the use of liquor "save at weddings
and funerals," and the taking of "alcoholic
drinks, excepting wine, beer, and cider."
The hardy, outdoor life which was led by
so many of our forefathers, prevented them
from feeling the full effects of their poisonous
beverages.
The English and Americans of to-day are
clescended from these drinking ancestors, and
inherit from them a craving for alcohol, and
are safe from the poison only when they let
it entirely alone.
The taking of a single glass of liquor, the
eating of brandy sauce or wine jelly, may
i62rouse  this  inherited. desire, though  its  posessor  may  not  have   c discovered  that  the
taint is in  his blood; the  appetite, becoming
uncontrollable, may bring its owner to a
drunkard's grave.

164THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.
MAN AND OTHER ANIM-ALS.
USCULAR action, digestion, circulation,
~-~i and all the work of the body, need to
be directed and controlled. This wonderful
task is given to the nervous system.
Plants have no power to think or feel:
cut a tree, and the bark and wood have no
sense of pain; the rose is neither glad nor
sorry when you take it from the stem --it
knows notmg of what is being done
The simplest forms of animal life have
very little of this nervous power; one of
them, the hydra (hd' dr), may be cut into
pieces, and each piece will form. a new hydra.
But animals which have the sense of feeling
-those which can be taught by man-possess
most of this power.I,

and clumsy, is used in India to build bridges,

other kinds of work.
But no other animal has so complete a

animal can think and plan so well. HIIe is
placed at the head of living. creatures, not to
be a tyrant to torment and destroy others;
b-ut to "protect all harmless living creatures,"
and to treat none with cruelty..
PARTS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.
The nervous system is divided into centers, cords, and nerves.
The most important center is the brain;
the principal cord is the spinal cord, which
passes down the back through a series- of
holes in the vertebrae; from the brain and
spinal cord, slender white threads, called
nerves, extend to all parts of the body. Other
nerves start from small centers or knots~ of
nerve-matter, near the backbone.
167NERVOUS POWER.
The nerve-centers are mainly composed of
soft, gray matter; the spinal cord has a core
of this same gray m.atter, surrounded by
white nerve-fibers.
What nervous power is, or how it is made,
we do not know; but it begins in the grag
matter, and is sent along the white fibers.
The centers are often compared to the
stations of a telegraph system where all messages, home and foreign, are received, and
whence orders are sent out in every direction.
The. cords and nerves resemble, in the same
way, the wires along which maessages are
sent.
THE BRAIN.
The brain is protected from injury by the
strong bones of the skull, and by three coverings or coats. The outer coat is very tough;
the inner ones are soft and delicate. The
two principal parts of the brain' are. called
the cerebrum (9fr6e brim) and cerebellum
(9cr e bl1' WIrn).
168THE CEREBRUM.
The cerebrum  is the part of the brain in
the upper, middle, and front of the head.
It has gray matFMG. 28.
ter on  the outside, and  white  
nerve-fibers on
the inside.
The gray matter is coiled back
and forth, so that
a  great  deal is
packed away in
this part of the
skull.  You may
get a good idea of
these' wrinkles or
Surface of the cer'e brumn.
foldings, by looking at a piece of brain coral, or at the meat
of an English walnut.
This is the part of the brain by means of
which we think; and wise thinking strengthens it, as proper exercise strengthens the
muscles. The greater the power and -activity
169of the mind, the more wrinkled and coiled
will the gray matter of the cerebrum become.
If this part of the brain is taken away
from a pigeon (p-ij'~n), it becomes stupid, and
takes no notice of things around it.
FIG. 29.
Pigeon Pom which the cerebrum has been renwved.
THE CEREBELLUM.
In the lower, back part of the skull, is
the smaller division of the brain called the
cerebellum.
Like the cerebrum, the gray matter is on
the outside; the white matter, inside; but
the coilings of the gray matter are finer,
170,more like layers or foldings; and the white
fibers extend into the gray, in such a manner that they look somewhat like the branch
of a tree-this is sometimes spoken of as
"the tree of life."
FiG. 30.

The special work of the cerebellum is not
fully understood.  If it is injured, one can
not use his body as he wishes; the messages
of motion are not sent correctly, the muscles
-do not obey his will, and he acts as if intoxicated.
If the cerebellum  is taken from  pigeons,
171VINOUS FERMENTATION.
BACTERIA AND YEAST.
If you should look at a drop of stagnant
water under a strong mi'cro scope, you would
be quite likely to find it full of small living
things, so tiny that you could not see them
at all with the naked eye; these minute'
animal and vegetable forms are alive, and
often in rapid motion.
In the air, also, are many living forms,
too small to be seen by the naked eye, called
bacteria (bae te' rY a).
There are particles coming from them
much smaller than the full-grown bacteria,
which will become bacteria by growth. These
are  called spores, and are floating almost
every-where in the air, and, from their extreme smallness, can get into places where
the bacteria might not be able to come.
They have been carefully studied with
the help of the microscope, and we know
that, instead of the air, it is these bacteria
or their spores in the air, which produce
fermentation in certain liquids.
16they   make   "uncertain,  sprawling   movements."  
THE SPINA-L CORD.
At the very base of the brain, is an important mass of white and

case when  one's neck  is
broken, respiration stops and death occurs
instantly. This part of the brain is so placed
as to be protected as fully as possible, and
it is rarely injured except in death by hanging.
The spinal cord, as has been said, extends
down the trunk through the backbone. It
is a white cord, about as large as the end
172of a man's little finger; down its whole
length, front and back, are two deep furrows.
THE SPINAL NERVES.
Thirty-one pairs of nerves pass off from the
sides of the spinal cord, divide and re-divide,
and send tiny nerve-threads all over the body.
Touch the skin ever so lightly and you feel
the touch, because the cutis is full of nerveends.
NERVE-TUBES.
Each nerve- appears to be a bundle of
small fibers; when viewed under a strong
microscope, the separate fibers are seen to
be really very small tubes.
These nerve-tubes do not branch off from
larger nerves as the smaller arteries branch
from  the larger, but lie side by side, bound'together by delicate membranes.
Each tiny nerve-tube is distinct from the
others as it passes into the brain. Were it
otherwise, we should often be confused and
often in danger.
If the nerve-tubes from your first finger
173were to unite with those from your thumb,
so as to make one large tube, you could not
tell, unless you used your eyes, whether you
pricked your finger or your thumb.
If the nerve-tubes from the feet united
to make one large tube, you could not know
by feeling, alone, which foot was cold, cut,
or bruised. But when a fly lights on your
hand, you do know perfectly well that he is
not on your face; the nerves carry word of
his presence to the part of the brain which
has to do with your hand.
KINDS OF NERVES.
In studying the heart, you learned that
two sets of nerves were necessary to its
proper "beating."  So the lungs, brain, and
other organs, are kept at work by certain
nerves and held from overaction by other
nerves which serve as " brakes."
By other sets of these signal-lines, we
know about the world around us. We can
not hear with our eyes, nor smell with our
ears; for the nerves of sight are affected by
light only, those of hearing "by sound only.
174By the nerves of smell, we perceive different odors; by those of taste, we enjoy food
and drink, and dislike some medicines and
various disagreeable things; while by those
of touch, we are told about the various
objects with which we come in contact-as,
for example, whether they are hard or soft,
rough or smooth.
In the cutis, too, lie the ends of those
fibers, or tubes, by means of which we receive our sensations of' pain; and here also
are the nerves which give us the power of
muscular motion.
FIBERS OF FEELING AND OF MOTION.
The two sets of nerve-tubes last mentioned,
though they look exactly alike, have two
kinds of work to do. However closely they
may be bound together, each performs its
own task and never interferes with that of
its neighbor.
One set--the fibers of feeling--carries messages to the brain from the body; another
set-the fibers of motion-brings messages
from the brain to the muscles.- THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.
HOW  THE NERVES WORK.
The nerve-fibers are like those telegraph
lines on which messages travel in a single
direction only: on one wire, all the telegrams
are sent to the central office; while on the
other, they are received from the central
office.
When the finger touches a hot iron, nerveends of the fibers of feeling send the message
along up the arm into the spinal cord, and
thence to the brain, which feels the pain.
At once, the brain sends back over the motion-fibers a message to the muscles in the
finger, telling them to remove it from the
iron.
All this is done in the twinkling of an
eye; and the pain, which seems to be in the
finger, is really perceived in the brain; and
yet the brain itself may be injured severely
without suffering, though it is the seat of
all pain.
An iron bar was once driven through the
upper part of a man's head and he felt no
pain.
176INJURIES OF THE NERV4S.
The fibers of motion and of feeling look
exactly alike, as has been said.  The large
nerve of the arm or leg is formed of many of
these fibers bound together. Near the spinal
cord, it is divided; all of its motion-fibers
come from the front part, all of its feelingfibers from the back part of the cord.
In time of war, soldiers often cut the telegraph lines leading to the enemy's camp;
then no message can be given or sent, till the
line is repaired.
In a similar way, if the back part of the
spinal cord, just where the nerve goes off to
the right foot, is injured, the sense of feeling
in the foot is gone.
You may prick it, or burn it, as much as
you please; no pain will be felt, because the
nerve fiber which should carry the message
of trouble to the brain is injured.
If the front part of the spinal cord is injured at the same place, the order to move
the foot may start from the brain; but the
muscles do not obey, because they do not receive it.  The message can not get by the
broken place on the line.  This is ho w wve
know  th ere are two sets of fibers connlected
with the brain-center.
FIG. 32,.
Nerves of the face and neck.
Have you ever had your foot soundly
"asleep-"? You had held it in such a positioin
that the nerves were pressed, and this partly
paralyzed them, so that, for a moment, the
foot could scarcely move or feel.
I r7'  If the spinal cord be divided, or seriously
diseased or pressed upon, there is no feeling
or motion in any part of the body below the
point of injury. This is called paralysis (paral'y sls), and is quite common.
THE CRANIAL NERVES.
The nerves'which start directly from the
brain, are called the cranial (era'ni al) nerves.
Among these are the nerves of sight,
smell, hearing, and taste; those which move
the muscles of the face; and those which control digestion, respiration, and the motions
of the heart.
From  one of these nerves, a humber of
little branches go to the center of each
tooth, and, in case a tooth decays so that
either the food or the air can reach them,
we suffer severe pain.
Sometimes, the dentist. "kills the nerve"
by putting against it creosote (ere'o sot), or
some other substance.  Then he takes out a
piece of the little white thread, and fills the
cavity with gold, or some other material, to
prevent further decay.
179THOUGHT.
But the brain has other important work
to do besides merely keeping us alive. It is
the organ of the mind. By it, we think and
reason: how, we do not know; but, God has
given us this wonderful instrument, and with
it we may do either good or evil.
Everytime one does right, it is easier for
him  to keep on doing right, because he
strengthens that part of the brain which is
used by the good powers of his mind.
Every time he does wrong, he weakens
this part, and strengthens the part used by
the powerS of his mind for evil-making it
much easier to do wrong the next time.
Thus we form habits that control us.
In this way, boys and girls who are mean
and cruel, whose thoughts are impure and
lives untrue, make the men and women who
do the mischief and sin of the world; while
those whose lives are pure and true, make
the men and women who are honored and
loved.
One reason why it is almost impossible
180for a drunkard to reform, is, because alcohol
has deadened that part of the brain which
lie needs to use in order to master his appetite.
The best quality of brain, as in the case
of gifted men and women, seems to suffer
the most.
HYGIENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.
Healthy blood is needed in order to have
healthy nerves; and proper food, fresh air,
and exercise, are necessary to healthy blood.,
To keep the mind strong and happy, we
must observe the rules of right living, and so
protect the brain. When the mind is hard at
work, an extra supply of blood is sent to this
organ; if it is over-worked, too much blood
and energy are thus taken from other parts
of the body, which then become weak and,
feeble. Neither brain-work nor muscle-work
must be neglected, for both are important.
Rest must also be given to this busy organ,
and quiet, dreamless sleep is the best brainrest. Sleeplessness is often one of the first
signs of insanity, that terrible disease inThe juices of the grape, apple, and many
other fruits, will, if placed under the right
conditions, ferment by the action of these
living forms.
In order to ferment some other liquids
and thus obtain intoxicating drinks, yeast *
must be added. In this way some people
brew home-made beer-by steeping various
roots, barks, and herbs in water, and adding
yeast and sugar enough to cause fermentation. The alcohol that is formed by the
change of the sugar, makes the beer a dangerous drink.
When a liquid is fermenting, the little
bubbles of carbonic acid carry a froth to the
top, which can be used as yeast to act on
other liquids.  At the bottom  lie the "settlings," a half-solid mass, sometimes called
the lees. Between the froth and the lees is a
thin, intoxicating liquid, which people drink
under different names, as, wine, cider, beer, etc.
Dry sugar will not ferment, nor will alcohol be formed in liquids which have an
* Yeast is really a plant, and it is the growth of the yeast plant
which causes fermentation in these liquids.
1 7which the mind loses, more or less, its control over the brain.
Blows on the head are dangerous, and
clhildren in their play, as well as older persons, should never give them.
Causes which weaken other parts of the
body, weaken the brain as well. Hence, impure air, unwholesome, ill-cooked food, unsuitable  clothing, lack of cleanliness -all
these tend to injure not only the brain, but
the whole nervous system.
The lack of properly prepared food and
other unhealthful ways of living, often lead
men and women to use alcohol, tobacco, and
opium, to deaden their feelings of restless
discomfort.
ALCOHOL AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.
You have learned howy alcohol injures the
organs of digestion, so that the food we eat
can not make us good blood; and how it
unfits the blood for the best use of the
body.
About one-fifth of all the blood in the
body is in the brain. Through and around
182the soft gray matter, in and out among the
white fibers, are the tiny blood-vessels.
You know, already, that these enlarge
from the drinking of alcohol; the blood then
sometimes stagnateS, and, at other times,
rushes throughl them too violently. No wonder a headache so often follows the glass of
liquor.
Sometimes, an artery bursts, because its
walls have been weakened by alcohol so tIhat
they can not bear the extra strain-; the blood
flows out, and death occurs at once. This is
called apoplexy (p' o plax o), and may result
from other causes than the use of alcohol.
But this is not all. The brain asks for
good blood, but it gets injured and unhealthy
blood. -Of course the brain can not be healthy
when made of poor material.
A boy can not whittle well with a broken,
rusty knife; a musician can not bring sweet
music out of a piano whose strings are not
in tune; and the mind can not do good
thinking, if it:has to work tlrough an unheal-thy brain.
A large share of the water in the body iscontained in the brain and the nerves, and
alcohol unites with this water, taking it
away from the parts where it is needed. More
alcohol goes to the brain of the drinking
man, than to any other organ except the
liver; its effect on the nerve-substance is
deadening-paralyzing- as you have learned.
The drinking man may not feel pain from
his inflamed stomach, partly because it has
but few nerves of feeling, and partly because
these are out of order and fail to carry messages correctly. Supposing that the alcohol
has been a good friend, he satisfies the craving-it has caused, by another dose.
Perhaps he takes it under the name of
"Bitters," or "Patent Medicine," ignorant of
the fact that most of these-are only extracts
of herbs mixed with alcohol, and that the
harm  done by the alcohol more than balances the good gained from the herbs.
WVhen the brain is partly paralyzed by this
narcotic, the man does not know what he
is doing--his power of thought is deranged,
and that of correct thought is gone-he is
"-crazy with liquor."  He believes himself
184stronger in body and mind; he sometimes
talks faster, but thinks less wisely.*
"The word of a drunkard, especially with
rega-rd  to  his  drinking  habits, can  not be
trusted.   An  old, but true, proverb  says:'A
drunkard is a liar.' His love of truth seems
entirely destroyed. And'the tendency to
*" Among the immediate effects of a few doses of alcohol, are
drunkenness, and, in rarer cases, crazy drunkenness and alcoholic
convulsions or fits.
"Still further use of the poison, brings on delirium tremens
(dgIr'l fim tr'mnes), and various maladies of the stomach, liver,
kidneys, lungs, and other organs of the body; insanity, and another
disease of the nervous system, called dipsomania (dip so ma' ni a); the
latter is an intense craving for alcoholic or other narcotic substances.
"This uncontrollable desire for liquor does not appear in those
who have never used alcoholic drinks; but sometimes, the first indulgence awakens the desire. With others, only a longer use will
produce it.
"Most persons, in their earlier indulgence, think themselves
capable of controlling their habits, and indulge without apprehension of danger.
"Even when that danger is apparent to others, it may not be
to them, until the desire and the habit are too strong, the will too
weak, or the indifference to consequences too great for any effectual
effort to change this course.
" The longer the indulgence, the stronger the habit, the feebler
the resistance, and the greater the indifference--until the victilmL
ic swallowed up in his self-invited destruction.
"From this view of the facts, it becomes too obvious to need repeating, that the remedy for drunkenness as a vice, and inebriety
as a disease, is abstinence from alcoholic drinks.
"It would be a4 insult to the intelligence of the reader to say
that the remedy for drunkenness is the use of wine or beer, of
which alcohol is the essential and active ingredient."-Prof. Palmer.untruthfulness often descends to his children.' "-Dr.- B. W. Richardson.
Many railroad companies will not employ
drinking men as engineers, since they can
not trust them  to run their engines safely.
Many battles have been lost, because the
generals in command were so intoxicated
that they could not properly order their troops.
If more liquor is taken, the paralyzed
nerves can not control the muscles, the man
staggers, his hands tremble, and are beyond
his proper control. The brain is still more
affected, and the drunken talk and actions
show too plainly that alcohol has conquered
all the better part of the man.
It is fully proved that a large number
of crimes for which men are sent to prisons
or jails, are committed when they are in
this condition.
A noted murderer confessed that never,
but once, did he feel any remorse. Then he
was about to kill a babe, and the little creature looked up into his face and smiled.
"But," said he, "I drank a large glass of
brandy, and then- I didn't care.".
186187
The poison deadened his nerves and brain,
the better part of his mind-his conscience
-was thus put to sleep, anld the evil of his
nature controlled him. Many a man spends
the most of his life behind prison bars, for
crimes that he would have shrunk from with
hlorror, had he not been drunk when he comimitted them.
The drinking of a very little alcohol is
enough to deaden, to some extent, the noblest
powers of a man's mind, and to make him
careless about the results of his actions. But
anger, cruelty, fierceness--the baser tendencies, in which he is like savages and wild
beasts, are not overcome until he is "dead
drunk."
Then all signs of life are gone, save breathing and the motions of his heart. Probably
the brain of a man who has once been "dead
drunk," can never be so strong and perfect
as it otherwise would have been.
ALCOHOL AND SLEEP.
The exact cause of sleep is unknown; but
we do know that in healthy sleep, the heartbeats more slowly than when one is awake;
the breathing is less rapid; and less blood is
coursing through the brain.
Alcohol interferes with all this, and the
sleep caused by its use is not healthy brainrest, but a heavy stupor from  which the
drinker wakens tired and often sufferling.
A narcotic has no power to cure fatigueit can only deaden the nerves for a while,
and thus prevent one from knowing that he
is weary while under its influence.
ALCOHOL AND THE -MIND.
No man can explain the connection between body and soul, the brain and the mind.
We simply know that a sound mind goes
with a sound body, a healthy mind with a
healthy brain. Alcohol never helps a healthy
body.*
The craving for itself which the poison
sets up in the system, tends to the destruction of health, character, friends, happiness,
* " Indirectly, alcoholism favors the production of nearly all diseases, by lessening the power of resisting their causes; and it contributes to their fatality, by impairing the ability to tolerate or
overcome them. "-Prof. Awutin Plint.
188usefulness, mind, and life. The only safe
course is never to drink alcohol in any form;
or, if the habit is formed, to break it off, at
once and forever.  The sudden ceasing to
drink is not a danger, but the wise way of
recovering lost health. Men in state-prisons
are not made sick by having their supply
of liquor taken entirely away.
TOBACCO AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.
Dizziness and partial paralysis are common results of the use of tobacco, especially
by the young. The deadening of the nerves
explains the "quieting" power of cigars.
When the effect of the tobacco has passed
away, the abused nerves are very likely to
tell the user of their discomfort, by leading
him to be irritable and unhappy.
What would you think of a young man
who, if his father gave him $1,000 to start:
him  in business, should at once burn up
$500, and then begin work with the rest?
Just so foolish is the boy who destroys
the God-given powers of his mind and body,
by the use of tobacco. He is cheating himself, throwing away a large part of' the energy and strength which he needs for the
work of life.*
It is even worse than this; for often one
of the first effects of tobacco and alcohol is
to make one ungentlemanly and forgetful of
the rights and feelings of others.
Tobacco-users smoke right in the faces of
other people, without once thinking  of the
impoliteness of such an act.  The odor of the
tobacco  often  makes others very  sick; but
the smoker does not care-he is enjoying ",a
good smoke."
These  are  not the  habits of true gentlemen;  but the-y  are  the  very  habits which
tobacco teaches.
A boy who attends its school, must not
only pay out much money, but inust give
up a large  share  of his manhood, in  return
for its teachings.
* Young men who use tobacco, say: "It does not hurt me." Does
not hurt you I Wait and see. In years to come, when you ought to
be in your prime, you will be a poor, nervous, irritable, nerve-dried
creature. Your hands will tremble, your head will ache, your sleep
will be fitful and disturbed, and your stomach out of order.
Sins against the laws of health, not punished at one end of life,
are sure to be at the other.--(Adapted from J. R. Black.)
190In Germany, children under sixteen are
forbidden to use it; the same is true of the
pupils of the public schools in France; and
of the students in the United States Naval
Academy at Annapolis, and the Military
School at West Point.
Those who run races or engage in rowing
matches, are denied alcohol and tobacco while
in "training."  Each man would be glad to
have his opponent drink a single glass of
liquor just before the contest, so as to weaken
him and make his nerves unsteady.
OPIUM AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.
The  opium-eater looks old while yet
young. It is harder to break off from the
use of this drug,. than from that of alcohol
or tobacco.
In sickness, it often relieves pain temporarily; but when long continued, and always
if taken in health, it paralyzes the nerves
and throws the telegraph lines of the body
out of order, so that no correct message can
be given or received, and deranges, often beyond repair, the whole system.
191excess of sugar. The united action of sugar,
~water, heat, and of the bacteria or spores
in the air, or of yeast- each in the right
proportion --are always required to produce
alcohol.
ALCOHOL FROM  GRAINS.
Starch forms a large part -of rye, corn,
barley, and other grains. If these are kept
moist and warm--as when planted in the
earth  in  spring or summer,-their starch
turns to sugar, when the grain, which is
a seed, begins to grow. Chew a grain of
sprouted corn or barley, and you will find
it sweet.
Barley is kept moist with water until it
sprouts, or throws out little roots. During
this process, most of the starch that is in
the barley, changes to sugar.  Heat is then
applied, strong enough to dry out all the
moisture of the barley and kill the young
roots.
Grain thus treated is called malt, and
from this malt, pale ales and beers are
made.
18It is a true narcotic.  If a certain  amount
quiets the brain to-day, more must be taken
next week to produce the same effect. The
opium-user is so enslaved by the  poison, that
he will lie, or steal, or  commit even  worse
crimes, to  obtain  the  fatal drug.
CHLORAL AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.
Chloral is also used to quiet the brain
and  induce sleep.   It, too, must often  be increased  in  dose.   Its  continued  use  greatly
injures the health, and there is constant
danger of taking a fatal overdose.

192SPECIAL SENSES-TASTE.
THE ORGAN OF TASTE.
tHE tongue helps in the acts of chewing,
swallowing, and speaking; but it is the
special organ of taste.
The nerves of taste are mainly in the
papillae of the tongue; as they are covered
by a thin skin -the mucous membrane-food
must be dissolved so as to pass through this
skin before it can be really tasted.
If one eats rapidly, he not only injures
his stomach, but loses much of the flavor of
the food. When the tongue is coated, as in
a fever, the sense of taste is impaired or,
sometimes, lost.
The nerves of the front part of the tongue
taste sweet and sour things; those of the
back part, salt and bitter things. The formerare connected with those of the face, so, when
you eat something sour, your face is likely
to "pucker up."  The latter are connected

with the nerves of the stomach, hence bitter
tastes often make us "sick at the stomach."
194SM ELL.
THE ORGAN OF SMELL.
The nose is the organ of smell.  It is
composed of bone and gristle.  It is connected with the back part of the mouth,
and is lined, like the throat, with the mucous rnembrane. It is divided into two parts
called nostrils.
The nerves of smell enter the nostrils
through small openings in the bone at the
back of the nose.
The sense of smell helps us to decide what
things to eat. If, for instance, the nose were
on one side of the mouth, we should not be so
likely, as we are now, to smell food before
eating it, and should be in much more danger of eating things unfit for food.
When we must swallow something that
is not pleasant to the taste, like some kinds
of medicine, it is well to shut the eyes and
hold the nose; it will not be so disagreeable,
if we use the sense of taste alone.
Impure air often warns us of its presence
through our sense of smell.
195HEARING.
THE ORGAN OF HEARING.
The ear is one of the most difficult parts in
the whole body to study or understand. It is
divided into the outer, middle, and inner ear.
FIG. 84.          When we speak
of the ears, we usually mean the curiously shaped pieces
of gristle on the
sides of the head.
Their principal use
seems to be to help
catch the sound.
The opening
which passes from
ne ear.        these into the head
is called the auditory (.' dl te rt) canal. This
extends to the middle ear, or the "drum"
of the ear, as it is sometimes called. The
"head" of the "drum" is a delicate membrane which is stretched tightly across the
inner end of the auditory canal.
Both the middle and the inner ear (which
196lies deeper in the head) are in the solid bone
of the skull, and are thus carefully protected
from injury.
A tube leads from the middle ear to the
throat. Perhaps you have noticed that old
people who are a little deaf, open their mouths
when they want to hear distinctly. This is
to let the sound pass in through this tube,
as well as through the auditory canal.
Very small bones, strangely curved tubes,
a little water, and millions of tiny nerves of
hearing, are found in the middle and in the
inner ear.
CARE OF THE EARS.
Very cold water should not be used in the
ears, nor should a draught of cold air be allowed to enter them.
No hard substance, like a pin, should be
pushed into the canal; for it might break
the "head of the- drum," and when this happens, the sense of hearing is injured.
If there is too much ear-wax, it will often
fall out of itself, in fine scales. It may, however, accumulate and require to be carefully
197removed. A "box on the ear" should never
be given; there is great danger of its making
one deaf. Pulling the ears is a cruel and injurious practice.
TOBACCO AND HEARING.
Ringing sounds in the ears and partial
deafness sometimes result frol-n the use of
tobacco.
SIGHT.
THE ORGAN  OF SIGHT.
The eyes are placed in deep, bony sockets
FIG. 35.      in the head, and are
pirotected   by  the
brows and lids.,  | T   The eyebrows are
projections of skin
covered with short,
stiff hairs; the eyelids are two flaps, or
curtains, of some7Te eye.
what gristly skin.
They have oil and sweat-glands like the rest
198of the skin, and a row of hairs grows from
each edge. These hairs, or eyelashes, help to
keep dust out of the eye.
The' tears come from  a gland that lies
above the eye, and just within the outer edge
of its roof. Every time you wink, some of
this moisture is washed over the eyeball,
clearing it of dust. The overflow passes by
a small tube, into the nose.
Grief, or even great joy, makes the tears
flow so freely that they run down over the
cheeks. The eyeball, by means of nerves ancd
muscles, can move inward, outward, upward,
and downward.
The " white of the eye" is a hard coat
which protects the parts beneath. The colored
circle--that which makes us call the eyes
black, or blue, or brown-is the iris (T'rrs). It
is like a circular curtain with a hole in the
center called the pupil.
When thle light is too bright, the pupil
contracts; when too dim, it enlarges. This
is done by muscular fibers that run round
the hole somewhat like the string in a hatlining; they contract and so draw the sides
199of the pupil together, or stretch and make
it larger.
A cat's eyes can do this better and more
quickly than ours. They need to be able to
see their prey in the dark, and so can open
their pupils very wide.
Back of the iris are various fluids and
parts, all of which help us to see. The fine
nerves of sight form a delicate expansion
or coat, which is the inner lining of the eye.
CARE OF THE EYES.
Looking at a bright light, or directly at
the sun, dazzles the eyes and may greatly
injure them. Weakness of vision and sometimes blindness result from  allowing sunlight, or an artificial ligllt, to shine directly
into an infant's eyes.
Squinting or rolling the eyes, even "for
fun," is a dangerous practice, because it
strains the muscles which should hold the
eyeball in place.
School seats ought not to face the windows, and one should never read or write
with strong sunlight falling on book orpaper. Reading in the twilight, or on the
cars when in motion, strains the eyes.
In reading in the evening, be sure you
do not face the artificial light; let the lamp
be shaded and the light fall from behind;
for writing, the lamp should be behind, and
at the left, so that the shadow of the hand
will not be in the way of the pen.
A lighted lamp, standing on a white or
*red cloth, and facing a person, as at the tea
table, is very trying to the eyes; the cloth
should be of a neutral tint, drab or brown,
and the ligllt so placed as to be above the
level of the eyes.
Sleeping-rooms should be partly darkened,
so that on waking in the morning, the
eyes may not be required to meet suddenly
a bright light.
Cinders may be removed from the eye,
by a little loop of fine thread or hair.
TOBACCO AND SIGHT.
Imperfect sight, and specks of light dancing before the eyes, sometimles result from
the use of tobacco.Heating to a higher temperature, so as
slightly to burn the sprouted grain, makes
dark malt, from which porter and stout--
dark colored drinks-- are manufactured.
If the sugar thus formed in barley is dissolved out of the grain with water, and yeast
is added, and the whole exposed to warm air,
another change takes place,-the sugar which
was once starch, becomes alcohol, and carbonic acid. By this process, a good food has
been changed to a poison; for the barley has
become an intoxicating drink-ale, beer, or
porter.
ALCOHOL AND BREAD.
We must not conclude that fermentation
is never a good thing. If it is stopped at
just the right point, and the alcohol all
driven off by heat, it improves some kinds
of food.
Crushed grain, or flour, is a valuable food;
but, in this form, is not pleasant to eat.
Yeast added to warm, moistened flour causes
fermentation. A little of the starch in the
flour turns to sugar, and then to alcohol and
19A  certain  kind  of blindness is  caused  by
this drug, and is cured by stopping its use.

would pass off into the air. But it is imprisoned by the sticky dough, and puffs it
up with little cells in its effort to escape,
thus making the otherwise solid mass, light
and spongy.
The very small quantity of alcohol which
was formed, evaporates, and the gas escapes
when the dough is placed in the strong heat
-of the oven; and a light, sweet loaf of bread
is left, that is better food than the flour.
Alcohol turns to vapor with less heat than
water. In bread baked enough to be food
fit for the human stomach, there is no alcohol. It has been turned to vapor by the hleat
of the oven, and has passed off into the air.
People who are ignorant of the truths you
are learning in these lessons, have supposed
that because fermented dough mnakes good
bread to eat, therefore fermented barley-juice
must make good beer to drink. But you
know the alcohol stays in the beer and not
in the bread, and that simple fact makes the
difference, in this case, between a food and
a poison.
20ALCOHOL IN FEBRMENTED LIQUORS.
AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL IN FERMENTED LIQUORS.
In one hundred parts of the fermented
juice of apples, or cider, there are from two
to ten parts of alcohol. In one hundred parts
of beer-the fermented juice of barley-there
are from three to ten parts of alcohol.
In one hundred parts of the fermented
juice of grapes and other kinds of fruit, or
wines, there are from twelve to thirty-seven
parts of alcohol (or six to seventeen, by weight).
It is estimated (in 1880) that twenty-two
and three-quarter million gallons of alcohol
are consumed every year by the people of
this country, in beer alone.
This makes nearly one-half gallon of pure
alcohol used by every man, woman, and child
of our 50,000,000-if all were foolish enough
to drink it.
As very many people drink no beer at
all, some of the beer-drinkers must get more
than this one-half gallon of poison during
each year.  Further study will show  you
the consequences of the use of this great
quantity of alcohol.HEAT AND FERMENTED  LIQUORS.
If you were to place fermented liquors of
any kind in an open kettle over strong heat.
their charm for the wine, cider, or beer-lover,
would soon be gone. It is for the sake of
the alcohol they contain, that people are fond
of these drinks, and this passes away in the
form of vapor from the boiling liquid; the
liquid which is left, has an insipid taste, and
no one would care to drink it.
ALCOHOL IN NATURE.
It is a mistake to suppose that because
grapes, apples, and barley, are healthful foods,
that wine, cider, and beer, made from them,
must also be healthful.
It is important to remember that fermentation entirely changes the character of the
substance it works upon. Nature rots her
various plant forms; but while the juice remains protected from the air by the skin or
husk of the unbroken grain, plant, or fruit.
its sugar will not ferment-therefore, alcohol
is never found in them.
22ACETOUS FERMENTATION.
ALCOHOL AND VINEGAR.
All vegetable substances come from earth,
air, and water, and return to them again.
Through the process of fermentation, vegetable liquids go back to earth, air, and water.
After the alcohol is formed, if it remains in
the- vegetable juice, exposed to moderately
warm air, the second kind, or acetous fermentation, takes place, changing the alcohol
to a sharp acid, called acetic acid and commonly known as vinegar.
When the cook has not baked the bread at
just the right time-that is, has not stopped
the fermentation before the alcohol began to
turn to vinegar in the dough, we say, "the
bread is sour."  This acetic acid does not pass
off in the heat of the oven as alcohol does,
but leaves its sour taste in the bread.
Vinous fermentation, producing alcohol,
can not -take place in jellies and preserves,
because they contain an excess of sugar.
WThen they begin to "work"- as they may,
23if kept in moderately warm air--acetic acid,
or vinegar, is produced  in  them  by acetous
fermentation;  the  acid  is not  made  from
alcohol in this case, but is the result of other
changes in the fruit juices. "Scalding" makes
them sweet again, by driving off this acetic
acid, which can escape from a thin liquid,
but not from the dough.
This acid is as different from alcohol, as
alcohol is from sugar. It is used for food.
Vinegar is made in this way from  hard cider
and other fermented liquors, and will change,
in its turn, if left in the same conditions that
produced it, and lose its acid taste; its water
all evaporating, nothing will remain but a
brown powder.
The earth, air, and water have claimed
again the matter only loaned to make the
fruit, plant, or grain.
REVIEW QUESTIONS.
1. What is fermentation?
2. Define vinous fermentation. What are bacteria?-spores?
3. What four things are needed to produce alcohol?
4. How is malt made? What liquors are made from it?
5. Define acetous fermentation. When does it take place?
6. What causes sour bread?--the "working" of jellies?
7. How may vinegar be changed to earth, air, and water?
24DISTILLATION.
~ THEN a liquid is changed to a vapor by
heat, and that vapor is turned again
to a liquid by cold, the process is called distillation (dls tll la'tion).
Cold surfaces condense the moisture in
the night air, and we say: "The dew is falling." By the heat of the sun, these drops of
water are turned again to vapor that rises
and spreads itself in the air; this is again
changed to water by cold, and falls in the
form of dew or rain. Thus, with her own
heat and cold, "Nature is ever distilling."
Unless sugar is dissolved in water, it will
not turn to alcohol; therefore, when first
formed, alcohol is always mixed with water.
Alcohol and water could not be separated,
until men, in imitation of nature, learned to
distill.
Every child who has watched the steampuffing from a tea-kettle, knows that heat
will turn a liquid to vapor.  Some liquids
require less heat than others for this change.
When two such liquids are mixed, one can
be made to pass off in vapor, leaving the
other. Thus alcohol and water may be separated.
Put a fermented liquor into a kettle over
the fire, with a pipe in its closely-fitting
spout to carry off the steam. Nearly all the
alcohol will pass off in vapor before the water
comes to the boiling point.
If this pipe is of the right length and
is cooled by ice or cold water, the vapor,
while passing through it, will turn to a liquid
and drip from the end of the pipe. If you
apply a lighted match to this new liquid, it
will burn with a pale blue flame, giving out
intense heat.
It is mainly alcohol which has been separated-distilled-from the fermented mixture.
What remains in the kettle is principally
water. The alcohol is unchanged in its nature; but is stronger, because not so much
diluted with water.
26FIG. 2.
fExperinzent.-You may easily make this experiment
for yourselves.
Put some hard cider into a teapot (b), and fasten
a piece of rubber tubing (e) about two feet long to
the spout.
Let the other end of the tubing reach into a
bottle (d) standing in a pail of cold water or on. a
block of ice (c).
Heat the cider by means of the lamp (a), being
careful not to make it hot enough for the water in
the cider to boil.
If the cider is not very strong, you may have to
re-distill it before you find the alcohol is pure
enough to burn.FOR

NEW YORK AND CHICAGODISTILLED LIQUORS.
In the manner just described, brandy is
distilled from wine or cider; rum  from fermented molasses; whiskey frorn fermented
corn, barley, or potatoes; gin from fermented
barley, or rye, afterward distilled with juniper berries. Ordinarily these distilled liquors
are about one-half pure alcohol.
Some of the water passes over with the
alcohol, so that these liquors are often distilled a second, and even a third time, to
make them stronger of alcohol.
*The alcohol usually sold is distilled from
fermented molasses; but it can be made from
any fermented liquor.  It is so greedy for
water that entirely pure alcohol can be produced only by distilling it with some substance such as lime, that is still more eager
for' water, and will take it from the alcohol.
DRUGGED LIQUORS.
Wine in its many forms was probably the
first, and, for many centuries, the only known
intoxicating drink.
28The ancients supposed that each of the
various fruit juices made a different'kind of
liquor; but you see all of them are mainly
alcohol and water.  The different taste of
each, if it is really what it claims to be, is
due to its own peculiar fruit, grain, or plant
flavor.
Poisonous drugs and coloring matter are
often added to alcohol and water to imitate
the various liquors. So much of this is done
that many of the fermented and distilled
liquors now sold and used, contain other
poisons added to their own ever-present one
-alcohol. As this is the most dangerous of
all, the idea that "unadulterated whiskey,"
or that the "pure, fermented juice of the
grape," can be "good," is a mistake.
HOW ALCOHOL WAS DISCOVERED.
The people who lived about 700 years ago,
thought that somewhere, if they could only
find them, were two things that would greatly
bless the world. First, something that would
turn iron and all common metals into gold,
and thus easily and greatly enrich the finder'
29second, an  *' elixir of life," which  would  prevent sickness and death, and keep those who
drank it forever young.
The men who tried many curious experiments in  search  of these  two  wonders, were
called  a]chemists   (al'ke mrsts).   It is supposed
an Arab, named Albucasis, was thus led to
discover alcohol by distilling it from wine.
He thought it was the long sought "elixir
of life." He drank heavily of it, urging others to do the same. His career of intoxication and violence was short. He had found
not the  "elixir of life,"  but the  "water of
death."

30TOBACCO.
tITNTIL within a few years, the Middle and
part of the Southern States have been
the chief tobacco-raising regions of our country. Now, however, the cultivation of tobacco
has spread, until many fertile valleys, even
as far north as Canada, are devoted to the,
growth of "the weed."
The plant reaches a height of several feet,
and has large, spreading, pale-green leaves,
which are dried, and then made into cigars
or prepared to be smoked in pipes, or chewed,
or used as snuff.
NICOTINE.
Tobacco, a powerful narcotic, contains a
substance called nicotine (nle'o tYn). A single
drop, if put on the tongue of a dog, will soon
kill the animal. An ordinary cigar containsnicotine enough to kill two men, if taken
pure.
One has to learn to like tobacco. Boys
who try it, know that at first it gives them
headache, dizziness, and sickness at the stomach. Their poor bodies try to tell them they
are taking a poison.
If they keep on, the nicotine deadens their
nerves, so they do not feel these effects,
though they are more or less injured all the
time.
CIGARETTES.
Many boys and young men learn to smoke
by beginning with cig ar ettes'. These seem
harmless because they are so small; but they
are one of the worst possible preparations of
tobacco.
The smoke of the paper wrappings is irritating to the lungs, and the cigarettes send
more poisonous fumes into the delicate aircells, than a pipe or a cigar would do.
Drinking men are almost always smokers
or chewers, and many a drunkard owes his
ruined life and happiness, to the appetite
32for narcotics formed by the use of tobacco,
and the company into which it led him.
Old cigar-stumps are often picked up from
the streets and smoked or made into cigarettes. This is worse than disgusting; for, in
this way, diseases may be spread, coming
from the mouths of the first users.  These
stumps are the "strongest" part of the cigars-that is, they contain the most nicotine,
which thus goes into the cigarettes.
TOBACCO- AND GROWTH.
A boy who uses tobacco runis the risk of
being dwarfed in body, mind, and soul;--of
becoming a nervous, sickly man, with a weak
memory and a feeble heart.
Physicians agree that many and serious
troubles result from its use, even by adults;it is certain that growing boys can never
indulge in it with safety.
An eminent physician-Dean of one of the
leading medical colleges in this country(Dr. A. B. Palmer, of the University of Michigan), says that young men who learn to
smoke or chew tobacco, destroy on an aver33age, by so doing, one-fifth of the enjoyment
and value, and at least one-tenth of the
length of their lives.
As with other narcotics, using a little
makes one long for more; the boy who begins
with one or two cigars a day, soon increases
the number.
Many men who are now slaves to this poison, would gladly be free from it; and very
few tobacco-users would advise their sons to
adopt the expensive, uncleanly, and worse
than useless habit.
COST OF TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL.
What is the yearly expense of a five-cent
mug of beer for each week-day, and two on
Sundays? How many barrels of flour would
this money buy at $6.00 a barrel?
What is the annual cost of the habit to
a boy who spends five cents for cigarettes
each day of the year? If, instead of burning
it up, the boy, when fourteen years old, puts
the value of the cigarettes into the SavingsBank daily, what will it amount to by the
time he is twenty-one?
34If a man earns one dollar a day, and spends
daily five cents for tobacco and five cents
for beer, what part of  his  earnings  is thus
worse than wasted on these narcotics?
If twenty cents a day be spent for cigarettes and  beer, what amount will be lost to
the user in three months' time?
What amount would be saved in ten
years' time, if a man who spends thirty cents
a day  for liquor, should  give  up  the  habit
entirely?
How much will the expense of "treating"
be likely to increase the amount one spends
for alcohol and tobacco?

HE  white poppy is a plant which  is
largely cultivated in India and China.
If little slits are cut in the unripe seedvessels, drops of milky juice come out. When
dry, these are carefully scraped off and sold
as opium (6'pl Aim).
From this opium, are made laudanum
(la.'da ncim), morphine  (m6r'phtln?), paregoric
(pAr e g6r'ie), and the various kinds of soothingsyrups. It is one of the most deadly of the
narcotic poisons.
EFFECTS.
Usually, these various forms of opium are
taken at first by the advice of the doctor, to
relieve pain. But the appetite, like that for
alcohol and tobacco, grows stronger, and the
dose is made larger, as the habit gains upon
its victim.
Opium does not make one violent, so asIto injure and murder others, as alcohol often
does; but its effects on the users themselves
are, if possible, even worse than those of
alcohol.
At first, the user seems to be in a pleasant and wondeirful dream; then he grows
stupid and unconscious. When he comes to
his senses again, there is a feeling of horror;
to free himself from this, he longs for more
of the drug, and will get it if possible. He
seems to lose all power of' self-control, and
breaks the most solemn promises, if, by doing
so, he can obtain the poison.
Many lives that might have been grand
and noble, have been destroyed by opium.
Druggists often have regular opium-customers: of these, there are many more women
than men, because women are more subject
to nervous diseases, and hence are more likely
to learn to use this drug.
Those who have the care of children, frequently quiet them by the use of soothingsyrup. It stops the baby's cry, of course; but
it does it by deadening the nerves and poisoning the tender child-life, often leaving
38injuries from  which it never recovers.  An
overdose at once kills the little one.
Gin and other liquors are sometimes used
for the same purpose. Because this practice
injures the health and often creates a craving
for alcohol, it is a cruel betrayal of trust on
the part of those charged with the care of
helpless intants.
THE NARCOTIC HABIT.
Chloral (klo'ral) and chloroform (kloro f6rm)
are often used in sickness; but, like opium,
are narcotics, and therefore dangerous helps.'
They should never be used in health, or
on trivial occasions, or for any length of
time.
One narcotic is very likely to lead to another. A gentleman once tried to break off
the habit of smoking, by drinking wine instead.  He found the wine was enslaving
him; he tried morphine, and soon became its
victim. At last, with a body sadly wrecked,
he returned to tobacco, his first enemy, with
his naturally fine abilities ruined through
the appetite for narcotics.Turning  from   one  narcotic  to  another is
merely a change of masters. The only hope
for the poor victim lies in his power to stop
using all of these poisons.

iBONES.
NY part of an animal or vegetable body
which has soine special work to do, is
called an organ. For example, the root takes
up food for the plant; the eye is the organ
of sight;.the nose is the organ of smell.
Plants and animals are calledcl organic
bodies, because they have organs.  Stone,
iron, coal, and other minerals, are called inorganic bodies, because they have no organs.
The solid parts of the body are called
tissues; thus we speak of the fatty-tissue,
and the muscular-tissue.
THE HUMAN SKELETON.
This is so much like the skeleton of the
ox or the cat, that studying their bones will
help us to understand about our own.The human skeleton is composed of about.
two hundred separate bones.  It forms the
frame-work of the body, and furFIGa. 4.
nishes a hard surface to which to
fasten the flesh.  It also protects
the softer parts within, as the
heart and lungs.
SHAPE OF THE -BONES.
Some are long, like those of
the leg and arm; some are flat,
like the bones of the head. In
the ankle and wrist, they are short
and irregular. All are shaped for
their special uses in the body.
COMPOSITION OF THE BONES.
The bones are made of both
mineral and animal matter.
To prove this, burn the legbone of a chicken in a slow fire;
1 taigh-o
(f,emu) sawed  the animal matter will pass away,
lengthwise.
leaving  a white  substance the
shape of the bone, until it is roughly touched
-then it crumbles into dust. This is a kinad
of lime, and is valuable as a fertilizer.
42The mineral matter may be removed by
soaking a bone for a few hours in weak
muriatic acid; the animal matter, or gristle,
which is left, is soft and yielding, so that
you may bend the bone, or tie it in a knot
if long enough.
Egg-shells also contain lime.  You may
easily puzzle some of your friends, by putting
an egg into a very small-necked bottle. All
that you need to do is to soak the egg in
weak acid, until the shell is so soft that it
can be pushed through the neck of thebottle; once in, it will take its natural form
again.
In childhood, the bones contain more ani-'
mal than mineral matter, and so are not
easily broken; in old age, there is more
mineral than animal matter, and the bones
are brittle and break very easily.
GROWTH OF THE BONES.
Like the rest of the body, the bones are
fed by the food we eat.
Mix some bright coloring-matter that is
not poisonous, as madder,:with the food given
43..to a young pig for a time, and then give the
same food without the color. If the animal
be killed after a short time, each bone will
show the color of the madder. This proves
that the bones were made from the food the
animal had eaten.
LIFE OF THE BONES.
In infancy, bones begin their life as a sort
of jelly, which hardens into gristle, or cartilage, as the child grows. This cartilage receives from the blood several kinds of food,
the most important of which are certain
forms of lime; these, little by litt-le, change
the soft gristle to hard bone.
Farmers give their hens oyster-shells,
which contain lime, so that they may have
material for the shells of the eggs they lay.
tHuman beings get lime from milk and other
foods containing it. When the bones have
too little lime, they are soft and weak.
A fatty matter, called marrow, is in the
inside of the long bones, with blood-vessels
passing through it and through very small
holes in the bone itself, carrying food for its
44life and growth.  Covering each bone is a
very thin, tough skin.
BROKEN BONES.
If an iron rod in a steam-engine should
break, would it be enough to fasten the
broken pieces tightly, end to end, and then
wait a few weeks for the iron to grow together? You laugh at the idea. But the
bones do that-they mend themselves when
broken.
All that is needed is to put the ends in
place and fasten them tightly with splints
and bandages, so that they can not move.
Soon a jelly-like substance, mlade from the
blood in the bone, connects the two ends;
then this changes to gristle, and, by-and-by,
into solid bone, and the break is mended.
The bones of young people, when broken,
unite readily, and, in a few weeks, become as
strong as ever.  This is due both to the
composition of the bones and the abundant
supply of repairing'substances in the blood.
A bone broken late in life is a long time
in being united, and is likely to remain weak.
45."AN ACT RELATINGC TO THE STUDY OF PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE IN
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
" fhe People of the State of'.Xlew Yoe, represented Zn'
Senate ancd Atssenzbly, do enzact as fbllo,ws:
"SECTION 1. Provision shall be made by the proper local school
authorities for instructing all pupils in all schools supported by
public money, or under State control, in physiology and hygiene,
with special reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks, stimulants,
and narcotics upon the human system."
Thus read, with slight modifications, the laws of
four other states, viz., Vermont, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.
This book has been prepared to meet the demands
of these states for intermediate grades of schools.
Since the laws say that Physiology and Hygiene, with
special reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks,
etc., shall be studied by all pupils in the public schools,
such of the obvious facts of Physiology as would
render the Hygiene intelligible have been included.THE SKULL AND FACE BONES.
These protect the organs of sight, hearing,
smell, and taste, and the brain, the organ of
thought.

jaw) bone.
THE TRUNK.
The bones of the trunk are the backbone,
or spine, the ribs, the breast-bone, and the
hip bones. The spine is composed of a series
of twenty-four little bones, called vertebrae.
46Cushions of gristle lie between       IG. G.
the vertebrae.  If it were not for.
this, walking and running would.   
jar the body greatly.
In sitting or standing, as we
do through the clay, these cush-'
ions are pressed, and so flattened.
When we lie down at night, they
return  to  their natural shape,   a
much as a rubber eraser wouldc do
if you pressed it with your finger   
and then toolk the finger away.
For this reason, one is really a
little taller in the morning than
at night.
The ribs are slender, curved  
bones, twenty-four in number,
twelve on each side of the body.
Behind, they are attached to tlhe
backbone; in_ front, seven pairs         The spTine;

The thigh-bone, in the leg above the knee,

two bones of the lower leg and those of the
ankle, foot, and toes.  In front of the kneejoint is a small bone, called the knee-pan.As there: are nineteen bones in each hand
or foot, they have a great variety of motions.
A hand or foot made of one bone, would be
stiff and  clumsy.*
CAVITIES.
There  are  two  principal cavities, or hollow places, in the bony frame-work.
The first is the  cavity  of the head.   The
second is a great hollow place, extending
from the neck to the legs, divided into two
parts by a partition called the diaphragm
(di' a fram).
In the upper part-the chest-are the heart
and lungs; in the lower-the abdomen-are
the liver, stomach, bowels or intestines, kidneys, and other organs.
* Many Japanese and Chinese use their toes almost as readily
as they do their fingers. They will pick up tools with their toes
and work with them, while managing other instruments in their
hands.
Workmen in Constantinople always sit on the ground, even in
planing a board; sometimes they hold a long-handled chisel in the
left hand, "while the toes guide the cutting edge in turning beautiful forms in a lathe."
"Arabs braid ropes with their toes and fingers laboring in concert." Our toes are so cramped in their stiff leather boots that we
do not pretend to use them.

PIhjs i 61'o og; tells the, uses of each part of the body.
Hftiel&amp; ie tells the conditions of health, and how to

524POSITIONS OF THE BODY.
The bones of children are easily bent out
of shape by wrong positions in sitting and
standing.  Their feet should be supported
when sitting, lest the bones of the lower
limbs become bent.
The head and shoulders should be thrown
back and the body held erect in walking,
standing, or sitting, or the spine will become
crooked.
The cushions of gristle between the vertebrae permit free and graceful motions of
the body. If we stand erect, with the chin
quite close to the neck, the head, without
being bent forward, is perfectly balanced over
our feet.
But if one has the habit of stooping forward, these cushions are so tightly pressed
on the front that they lose their elasticity;
then one can hardly keep erect, and we say
he is "round-shouldered." Bad as this looks,
it is the cause of worse trouble, as will be
seen when we study the lungs.
If the body leans to one side, when one
53is standing, the hip bones will soon grow
out of shape. Unless careful about this, you
will make your body one-sided by your position at the blackboard, or when standing
to recite.
In walking, the foot expands in length
and breadth. This should be remembered in
buying shoes.
The heels of shoes ought to be low and
broad, and placed well back; higll heels
crowd the foot forward and throw the whole
body out of position. The shoe should be
broad across the ball of the foot and the
toes.
Tigh-t shoes and high heels make the toes
over-ride each other, spoil the natural beauty
of the foot and the graceful carriage of the
person, and are likely to cause bunions, corns,
and ingrowing toe nails.
The laws of:health are of much more
importance than those of fashion. Children's'shoes must be changed frequently for larger
ones, on account of their rapidly-growing
feet; if this is not done, serious injury will
b' the'result.
5-4TOBACCO AND THE BONES.
In whatever way tobacco may affect grown
people, it is very certain that its use in
childhood stunts the boiles and dwarfs all
the growth of the child. No boy who wants
to become a full-grown, well-shaped mani, can
afford to smoke or chew tobacco.

4socket" joints, which permit very easy movements of the arm and leg. In the fingers,
wrist, and knee, are "hinge-joints," so named
because the bones move backward and forward like a door upon its hinges. The bones
of the head have rough  edges which  fit into
each  other, making  immovable joints.
An  engine must be often  oiled, or it will
not  run  properly.   It  can  not take  care of
itself. But the bones not only mend themselves, but  oil themselves.   The  joints  are
kept moist by  a thin  fluid like the  white  of
an egg; this comes from the smooth lining
of the inside  of the joint;  and  it makes the
ends of the bones move readily on each other.

0MU SCLES.
HE muscles are the flesh
of the body. They consist of bundles of threads or
fibers; between the fibers
are blood-vessels and nerves.
The muscles are fastened
to the bones by strong,
tough cords, called tendons
or sinews; these are easily
seen, by pulling off the meat
from the leg of a f'owl. The
"lean meat" which Awe eat
is the flesh or muscles of
the animal.
Cut, carefully, some
boiled corned beef, and you
can divide it into the little
threads of which it is made..
When people have only
FIG. 12.
Tendon of the and.
Tendon, of the hand.small, thin muscles attached to their bones,
they are weak and can not do much work.
In some parts of the body, fat lies over
the muscles, and is, to some extent, mingled
with thlem. A kind of inner skin, called
" connective-tissue," covers the flesh, bones,
gristle, and other organs.
EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION.
When a boy raises his fore-arm, saying,
"Feel my muscle," each fiber of the muscle
on the front of his upper arm has shortened
and thickened. This pulls up his fore-arm.
When he stretches his arm, the fibers
lengthen and return to their natural shape,
and a muscle on the back of the upper arm
shortens and thickens in a similar way.
USES OF THE MUSCLES.
It is by means of the muscles that we
keep erect, walk, run, leap, or move in any
way. The motion of the many muscles of
the face gives it variety of expression, showing the feelings of the mind.
Within the skeleton, in the cavities of the
58trunk, there are muscles at work, without
which we could not live; for instance, the
heart, that sends the blood all over the body,
is a strong muscle; the outer coat of the
stomach has a lining of muscular fibers.
VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY MUSCLES.
Some of the muscles, as those of the arm
or face, we can move when we choose, or will
to do so; others, as the heart and diaphragm,
keep at work without any thought of ours;
they will not stop by our wishing them to.
The first are called voluntary muscles;
the second, involuntary muscles.
HYGIENE OF THE MUSCLES.
Good food, pure air, and proper exercise,
are necessary for muscular health. Long disuse of a muscle wastes it away.  Exercise
causes new fibers to form and old fibers to
increase in size.
But too much, or too violent exercise is
dangerous, and it is wrong to work so hard
as to be always tired. Variety of exercise
rests the nmuscles.One who lhas been working with hands,
or brain, all day, will be rested by a brisk
out-door walk. When one has been using his
lower limbs for some time, they are tired;
if he then sits down, and uses his arms, or
hands, and thus rests the muscles of his legs,
* or uses his brain in thinking or reading, he
will feel refreshed.
Brisk exercise should not be taken just
before, nor after a full meal. Exercise outdoors is better than exercise in-doors, and
should be taken daily by all who would have
good health.
KINDS OF EXERCISE.
Playing ball, rolling hoop, throwing beanbags,&lt; coasting, skating, and swimming, are
capital forms of exercise, if not carried too
far.
Jumping the rope is not good exercise, for
it jars the body too much, while there is great
danger of catching the feet in the rope and
so getting a hard fall, and, perhaps, a broken
limb.
Sawing wood, and keeping the wood-box
60and coal-hod filled, running home-errands
with happy faces and light hearts, are
healthful ways of exercise.
Cheerfulness is a great help to exercise.
Whistling or singing is a good sign in a
working boy or girl.
ALCOHOL AND THE MUSCLES.
Press your finger on lean beef before it is
cooked, and notice how  the part touched
springs back when you take your finger
away.
Do the same with fat meat, and you
will find that a deeper dent stays there. If
the flesh in your body, like the fat, could
not contract, you would not be able to
move.,Beer, gin, wine, cider, and all alcoholic
drinks, tend more or less to change the
muscles themselves to fat.
The muscles can not move and work
properly, when thus changed; not only does
this fat prevent their healthy action, but it
is made from waste matter that should be
sent out of the body.
61Beer is especially bad in this respect.
Beer-drinkers think they are growing strong
because they grow  fleshy.  But they  are
only loading their muscles with this useless fat, which hinders instead of helping
them. Beer-drinkers often die from  a certain  kind  of heart disease, called "fatty
heart."
The poor heart is not only clogged, but
also weakened by this increase of fat, and the
more beer one drinks, the greater the increase
of fat. The heart bears this abuse as long as
it can, and then it stops-the drinker is dead.
LIFE AND DEATH.
Let us try  to  see witl "the mind's
eye," the bones, the gristle, the muscles, the
tendons and connective-tissue, the cavities
of the head, chest, and abdomen with their
organs; remember, as we look, that these
are all bound together in one life.
The most wonderful thing in the living
body is the mind or soul. We think at once,
when we see a dead body: " How still and
cold it is! " Bodily waimth and motion show
62life; but what life is, we have no means of
knowing.
Our present study will teach us how to
preserve it, and how to keep our bodies strong
and healthy.
So important a subject should receive the
careful attention of every one, and the rules
that are of benefit to health ought to be
followed.

Why?
63I have examined the manuscript of this book, and
find it covering more matter that I think should be
taught in the elementary lessons on life and health
in the schools, than I have found in the other works,
with similar objects, which I have had occasion to
examine.
It is free from the errors which have been noticed
and objected to in several other works on this subject
designed for school use.
I also think it free from such overstatements as
are likely to be produced by ardent zeal.
If all the facts contained in this little work are
firmly lodged in the minds of the pupils in our public schools throughout the country, an immense work
for good will be accomplished.
Being profoundly impressed with the enormous
evils to our race produced by the habitual use of
narcotics, including alcohol, opium, and tobacco, I
can but rejoice at the promising efforts to make obligatory in the public schools the teaching of Physiology and Hygiene, with special reference to these20. What is said of beer as a drink?

OOD is any substance which can be taken
into the body and used for its health,
life, and growth. We must have daily food to
repair the daily waste of our bodies, to'keep
them warm, and, in childhood and youth, to
make them grow.
SOURCES OF FOOD.
The earth and the air contain the materials on which'our lives depend. But most
of these materials mrust be changed in form,
before they are fit for us to eat.
WTe hold in the hand a grain of whvleat.
It has no sign of life; no leaves show that
it can drink in moisture and sunlight. Its
outer husk is hard and dry.  It seems no
more alive than the grains of sand on which
we are standing.Put it into well-prepared ground. By the
help of the sun, air, and moisture, it sends
out rootlets into the dark earth, green shoots
break through the soil, and the stem lengthens. By-and-b/y, a graceful plume loaded
with the grain that is to make our bread,
trembles in the breeze.
Down in the meadow is a beautiful carpet of green grass. It is a good place for
play, but you could not eat the grass; you
would starve to death if you had nothing else.
But that grass is growing, in order to
make food for you. Cattle are feeding on it;
it goes into their bodies, and out of it, are
made the milk you drink so freely, and the
flesh which may come to your table as roast
beef or beefsteak.
We eat, unchanged, a few inorganic substances, or substances which have never had
life, such as water andl salt; but most of
our food is organic--has been living,--it has
been prepared by plants from the earth and
air, or by animals who, by their own eating
and living, have changed vegetable into animal matter.
66KINDS OF FOOD.
Our food is divided into three great classeslst.-Mineral food.
2d.-Tissue-making food, or food for the
growth or life of the various parts of the
body.
3d.-Heat-making food.
MINERAL FOOD.
This includes all inorganic substances that
we eat unchanged, together with some that
we get in other kinds of food.  The most
important of these are water and salt.
If a man weigh 160 pounds, about 140
pounds of this weight is nothing but water"quite enough, if rightly arranged, to drown
him.'"
Much of this is in tl-le blood, some in the
muscles, some in the tears, and the rest in
other parts of the body, as you will learn by
fu'rther study. It dissolves other food, so that
the body can use it, and helps to regulate
the heat of the system.WVe must have water to drink, and it
should be pure and good. Death from thirst
is quicker and more painful than death from
lack of food.
We do not drink all the water which the
body requires; for we get a large part of
the amount needed in the food itself, as in
fruits and vegetables, the juices of meat,
milk, and the water used in cooking these.
PURITY OF WATER.
Water that runs through lead pipes, is
very likely to dissolve some of the lead, if
it stands in the pipes for any length of time.
Lead is a very sure poison. Care must
be taken to draw off all the water that has
so stood, so as to avoid danger.  You will
learn more about poisoned water in the chapter on respiration.
SALT.
Watch the sheep when the farmer "salts'
them, and see how eager they are for the
treat. Salt is necessary to man, as well as
68to the lower animals; but it exists naturally in most food-materials. A moderate
amount of it, as seasoning, makes our food
more agreeable and healthful.
LIME, PHOSPHORUS, AND IRON.
The bones need lime, the brain requires
phosphorus, and the blood must have iron,
in order to be perfectly healthy.
But we can not eat clear lime, phosphorus,
or iron. We must get them by eating vegetables which have taken these minerals
from the ground and made them into material fit for our use, or by eating the flesh
of animals which have fed upon such vegetables.
TISSUE-MAKING FOODS.
Among the most important of these are
milk and the grains; they are found, too, in
eggs and the different kinds of meat.
Wheat contains mote of these foods than
other common grains, and bread made from
this g-rain is most nourishing and best.
69HEAT-MAKING FOODS.
These are of three kinds: fats or oils,
starch, and sugar.
THE FATS OR OILS.
These are found in both animal and vegetable food; for example, beef and mutton
suets, the cream of milk, the yolks of eggs,
Indian corn, olive and palm oils.
People who live in cold climates need
and crave much of this kind of food.
A story is told of some English sailors
who prepared a "Christmas tree," as a treat
bfor a company of Esquimau children.  As
no suitable tree could be had, they made an
imitation one, by tying together walrus bones,
shaping the whllole to look as much as possible like a tree.
Instead of candy, they made some balls of
whale blubber and hung them on the "tree."
The children were delighted and ate the balls
of fat as eagerly as you eat your Christmas
candies.
Some food of this kind is necessary; and,if one does not like it, he should learn to
eat enough of it for health.
Those who do not eat fats of any kind,
are usually thin and unhealthy and likely
to have some serious disease, as scrofula or
consumption, even while young. Butter may
be used instead of fat meat if preferred. On
the other hand, too much fat must not be
eaten; a naturally fleshy person requires less
than the average arnount.
S T A R C HI.
Starch forms a large part of most grains,
seeds, roots, and unripe fruits. As you know,
it must be cooked, or, in fruits and nuts,
ripened, before it is fit for food.
Corn-starch and potato-starch are in common use by the cook and laundress.  Rice,
the chief food of the people of India, China,
and Japan, is three-quarters starch.  Unripe
fruits, as green apples, contain so much starch
that they are very likely to make you sick
if you eat them uncooked.
All starchy foods, as those from the grains,
require long and thorough cooking to makethem  more easily digested and more nourishing.
Gum resembles starch, but is less nutritious. Some kinds, as gum arabic, are used
for food in Eastern countries.
SUGAR.
Sugar is an important article of food.
But a person would, in time, starve to death
if fed alone on either sugar or starch.
Too much sugar is often eaten in the
form of candy, and does much harm when
eaten between meals.  Injurious substances
are- often put into candy, to give it color or
increase its Weight. The results of eating
much candy are a "sour stomach," "bad
breath, " and other serious troubles.
The coloring matter in candies is often
really poisonous, and even the white candy,
usually considered the purest, is sometimes
largely made of "terra alba" (t6r'rA Al'bA), a
kind of white earth.
Put a piece of candy into a tumbler with
a little water; if it is not pure, when the
sugar has dissolved, the terra alba will sinkto the bottom  of the tumbler in the form
of a white powder.
Thus you can easily prove whether you
are eating sugar, or a substance that is worse
than useless, because it clogs the body.
MI L K.
Milk is the only food provided by nature
for young children.  Since the child lives
and grows upon it, we should expect milk
to contain, as it does, the different classes
of food.
The cream  is fat, or heat-forming substance; the curd, which can be pressed into
cheese, belongs to the tissue-making foods;
there is enough sugar to give it a sweet
taste, and it contains lime and other minerals needed to sustain healthy life, besides
water, of which it has 88 parts in 100.
WHAT TO EAT.
Most people, in temperate climates, eat
both animal and vegetable food. You will
usually find the three great classes of food
on the dinner-tables of your homes.narcotics, and I know of no work which is a better
introduction to the subject than the present textbook.
Of the diseases, the degeneracy, the vices, and the
general ill-being produced by the alcohol habit, all
observers must be aware.
The evils of the opium habit are scarcely less, in
proportion to its more limited extent, and the habit
is, if possible, even less likely to be broken up when
once established.
The tobacco habit, though less disastrous to individuals and in its moral and social effects upon
communities, still, by its greater prevalence, is doing
an amount of mischief, especially with boys, which
none so fully know as those physicians who have
given special attention to the subject.
The influence which indulgence in one narcotic
has upon the resort to others, should be more fully
recognized, and the great importance of abstinence
from all of them will, by these teachings, it is hoped,
be more fully understood and appreciated.
It therefore gives me great pleasure to say this
much, and in this place, in favor of the objects and
the execution of this work, and in commendation
of the efforts of those who have had the labor of its
preparation.
A. B. PALMER.
ANN ARBOR, Sept. 1, 1884.
6Water and salt are mineral foods; potatoes and meat, heat and tissue-making foods.
Most persons crave the fat of butter with
the starch of bread.
Pepper, mustard, and vinegar,. are not
needed in building up the body and should
be very sparingly used, if at all. Probably
a perfectly natural and healthy appetite
would not crave them.
If the system needs acids, lemons and
limes, which are more healthful than vinegar, may be eaten. Fresh, ripe fruit which
generally contains some acid, is wholesome
wh-en too much is not taken.
TEA AND COFFEE.
The value of these to adults is doubted
by many wise physicians. Certainly they
are not necessary or safe drinks for children.
COOKING.
Health is, in great measure, dependent
upon the way in which our food is cooked.
Meat should be boiled, roasted, or broiled.
Neither meat nor any other food should be
74fried: heated fat hardens whatever is cooked
in it, making it difficult of digestion.
To eat or drink what we know is unhealthful, because it tastes good, is not only
foolish but wicked.
A cook who well understands the laws
of health, will not feed the family on hot
bread, because it makes a pasty mass in
the stomach which can not easily be digested.
Instead of rich pastry, and cake heavy
withl fruit and spices, which overload the
stomach and unfit it for proper work, juicy
meat, mealy potatoes, ripe fruit, and light,
sweet bread, will be prepared. The latter,
when it is made from the whole wheat,
ground, forms, with the addition of butter,
and some water to satisfy thirst, a perfect
food.
In "bolting," the phosphorus and much
of the flesh-making part of the grain is lost.
Fine wheat flour is not so nourishing for
the brain and muscles, as that flour which
contains some of the outer portion of the
kernel.FRUITS.
Ripe fruits, such as apples, oranges, bananas, and berries, make the most healthful
"dessert."   The skins, cores, and  seeds should
not be swallowed, as they are useless and
may cause trouble if eaten.

76ARE NARCOTICS  FOODS?
IS ALCOHOL FOOD?
PERFECT food, as we have seen in the
case of milk, contains water, tissuemaking, and heat-making materials.
Alcohol is not a food, for it can not build
up any part of the body. It contains no mineral substance, and will not make healthy fat.
Materials in the blood which should make
muscles, bone, etc., as well as those which
should be sent out of the body, are sometimes changed into useless fat by the action
of alcohol. The heat of the body is lessened
by alcohol, instead of being increased.
IS BEER FOOD?
Beer is made from water, malt, hops, and
yeast.  Water can be obtained better and
cheaper elsewhere. The starch of the grain,you remember, was changed into sugar by
malting, and the sugar turned into alcohol
by fermentation, thus losing its food nature.
The gummy substance lef't after the starch
turned to sugar and then to alcohol, and the
hops, may contain a slight amount of material that the body can use. But the amount
of food in beer is so very small, as scarcely
to be worth taking into account in speaking of its effects.'"As much flour as can lie on the point
of a table-knife is more nutritious than eight
quarts of the best Bavarian beer." (Liebig.)
A man gets one glass of pure alcohol in
every twenty glasses of lager -beer that he
drinks; in the stronger beer, one glass of
alcohol to thirteen of beer.
There is no truth, you see, in the claim
that beer makes one stronger. There is no
food in it worth mentioning, and its alcohol
does a vast amount of harm.
IS WINE FOOD?
A few raisins contain more nourishment
than much wine. Sugar in fruit-juice becomes alcohol by fermentation; it is the alcohol, which is not food, that the winedrinker wants. Often more alcohol is added
to the wine made from  pure fruit-juice, to
satisfy the craving for a stronger drink.
The more sugar there is in a liquid undergoing vinous fermentation, the more alcohol will it produce. Sweet apples and sweet
grapes make strong cider and strong wine.
-Currant, gooseberry, elderberry, and other
home-made wines, sometimes contain even
more alcohol than the wines of commerce,
because sugar is added to the fermenting
juices.
Cider and these home-made wines contain
the merest trifle of food-material, and are
no more "innocent drinks" than port or
champagne (sham pan). The poison, alcohol, is
there, ready to do its deadly work.
People not only become intoxicated by
drinking these wines; but, by their use,
a craving is often created for stronger
drinks-that is, those which contain more
alcohol.
By drinking a larger quantity of the
79weaker liquors, the user gets the alcohol his
increasing appetite demands. This is especially true of beer-drinkers.
IS CIDER FOOD?
Cider is a fermented drink made from the
juice of apples. In the open air, at summer
heat, apple-juice begins to ferment in about
six hours after it is drawn off from the pulp,
and sometimes sooner.
A little juice often remains in the cidermill after a previous grinding. If this ferments and is allowed to remain, it will act
as yeast, hastening fermentation in the juice
of the next lot of apples ground.
When little bubbles begin to pass through
the liquid and break at the top, as the froth
gathers, we may know that the sugar is
turning to alcohol. The bubbles are the escaping carbonic acid gas.
If the apples are fairly sweet, alcohol
will form until in ten cups of hard cider,
there will be one cup of pure alcohol. Thus
the barrel of cider that may possibly have
been sweet, when it was put into the oellar,
80gains in alcohol every day, until it begins to
turn  to vinegar.
Cider is mainly water and alcohol. As
the latter is a poison, the old custom of considering the barrel of cider as important a
part of the family food as the barrel of flour,
had no truth for its foundation.
There is great danger that the ciderdrinker will learn to crave a stronger drink,
because  alcohol makes  those  who  drink  it
thirsty for more. Many of those who die
as drunkards in this country, began their
course at the cider barrel.
If the people who  drink cider for its acid
taste and effect, would take lemon or limejuice instead, they would get the acid without the poison of alcohol.
STIMULANTS.
"Alcohol* never acts as any thing but
* Alcohol has been falsely called a stimulant, because it sometimes makes the person who takes it feel stronger, and seem more
quick-witted and talkative, for a short time. But a reaction follows, just in proportion to the amount of excitement there has
been, and the person is more or less weak and depressed.
Whipping a horse causes him to move faster for a while; yet
it gives no fresh strength to the animal, but rather uses up that
81a  paralyzer."--Dr. James Edmunds.   "Alcohol has
clearly no right to be called a stimulant."--
Dr. J. J. Ridge.
People have called alcohol a stimulant,
because they were ignorant of its real nature.   It gives the  body  no  added  strength;
its  only  effect  on  pain  and  fatigue  is  the
deadening of the nerves, so that one does
not realize the disordered, exhausted condition of his body.*
The apparent increase of energy which
alcohol gives, is due to the partial paralysis
of a certain class of nerves in the body
which  act as  its  "brakes."   Alcohol, therewhich he already possessed, so that he overworks and is more
tired as the result. Spurring to increased action without giving
any food which the body can use to balance the extra "wear and
tear, " is not the action of a true stimulant, and the term is
wrongly used when thus applied.
* Suppose, for instance, you measure your muscular strength
with a health-lift, and then take some of the drink which you
think will give you power. When you feel strong, measure your
strength again. The drink has fooled you, that is all. You felt
that you were stronger than natural; you find that the narcotic
has been true to its paralyzing nature and that you are weaker.
Then, after a time, when the drug- has spent itself and you
feel weak and prostrated, measure your strength once more. Fooled
again; the stuff has fooled you twice.  When you felt yourself
strong, you were weak; and now, when you feel yourself weak,
you find yourself really stronger, for your natural strength is returning.-Adapted from Dr. A. F. Kinne.
82fore, is not a stimulant in the proper sense
of that word.
ALCOHOL AND WORK.
*A vessel coming from Australia sprung a
leak soon after starting, and the men had to
work at the pumps all the way home.
At first, regular rations of liquor were
given; but the sailors soon began to grow
weak and tired. Then the captain stopped
the use of liquor, giving an extra supply
of food, instead. At once, the men began
to sleep well and to waken strong and
rested.
In spite of the hard work at the pumps,
the crew were in good health when they
reached England. The liquor deadened-narcotized-the nerves which control muscular
action, and the men lost strength thereby;
the food furnished building material for
their bodies and so increased their working
power.
"The following statement was made by Sir
William Fairbairn, an eminent engineer of
Manchester, England, when at the head of a

body for food and water, though only
the throat seems to call for the water and
the stomach for the food.
Digestion is the preparation of the food
which has been taken into the stomach, for
the use of the body.
Many wonderful changes must take place,
before the beef;, potatoes, bread, water, and
other food which we eat, can become solid
bone and liquid blood, strong muscle, working hand, and thinking brain.
WASTE AND REPAIR.
Tearing down and building up-making
and unmaking- these two processes are always going on within us.
If you stand by a city market, early on
a summer morning, you may see carts bringing green peas, fresh meat, milk, and other
food, from the country farms. Other carts,
at the same time, are carrying off barrels
of ashes, bones, scraps of food, and other
waste matter. They will dump this stuff far
enough from the city to prevent any harm
to the people from its decay.
Work very much like this goes on in
your body.  There are certain vessels whose
special duty it is to carry the prepared food
to the different organs, and others that are
the scavengers of the human system.
If you should stop eating, you would
starve to death in a short time; if you
should keep the waste matter in your body,
instead of letting it pass out through the
skin, lungs, kidneys, and other organs, you
would die even more quickly.
ORGANS OF DIGESTION.
The principal organs of digestion are the
mouth, gullet or esophagus  (e s6ph'a Otis),
stomach (st6m'aelq), and intestines (Yn t6s'tln%5).
Taken together, these are often called the
food-canal..
88This canal, in a full-grownl person, is about
thirty feet long. Here and there, beside it, are
little fleshy bags called glanlds; these glands
have the  curious power of separating certain juices from the blood;         MG. 1.
this  is  called  secretion
(se  re' tion).
It is these juices which
digest the food. A tongue
much coated shows that
other portions of the bfoodcanal, as well as the part
which we can see, are out             "
