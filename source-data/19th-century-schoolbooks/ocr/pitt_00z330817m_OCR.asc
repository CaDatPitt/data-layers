716. Before the year 1700, colonies were established in various places
which generally increased with astonishing rapidity, in populationll, wealth
and importance.
717. England early claimed the right of appointing all the officers)
Colonies, especially their governors, and finally of taxing them.
718. This encroachment on thleir liberties the colonists resolved not
endure. Petitions and remonstrances having proved ineffectual, they deter
mined to support their rights by force of arms.
719. At Lexington, in Massachusetts, the first battle was foufght on the
19th of April, 1775, and firom this time, is dated the commencemenlt of open

world, that they "were,.and of right ought to be, free and independent
States," with the title, as a nation, of " The United States of Amesica."
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
721. The struggle which followed was long and bloddy, but the American
arms, directed by Washington, achieved for our country, by the blessingr of
IHeaven, a glorious independence.
722. This war, which caused the final separation of the colonies from
England, is called the American Revolution.  It lasted seven years, peace
beinig proclaimed Jan. 20th, 1733.

731. The members of the House of Representatives are chosen by the
people for the space of two years. Since March, 1833, each state is entitled to one representative for every 47,700 inhabitants. ~
732. The President is chosen by persons called electors, taken from all

of Representatives, receive each 16 dollars per day.
738. In each state is a Circuit or District Court. The Judges of the Circuit Courts assemble annually at Washlington, and constitute what is called
the Supreme Court of the United States. The principal business of these
Courts is to expound the laws of the United States, and to settle all questions which arise under the Constitution and treaties of the United States.
The Judges are appointed by the President, by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate. The power of the Supreme Court is called the
Federal Judiciary.

island, formerly called Manhattan island, at the bead of New York bay,
about 20 imiles from the Atlantic, and at the confluence of the East and
l!udson, or North, rivers. The island is about 15 miles long from  lorth to
south, and has an average breadth of on,e mile and a half. T'he city extends
over the whole island, occupying the same exteit with the county. 5lhe
compact part extends about thiree miles on the bankls of eaci river.'The
harbor is deep enough for the largest ships. From the city across Hudson
river to Jersey city, is one mile, and across East rier to broolilyn, it is
fromi one third to one halif of a mile. T'he city is principally built of brick,
and most of the edifices have a neat, and maany of thlem aii elegant appearance.
853. The principal street is Broadway, which is 80 feet in width, and
about three mniles in length. It fuinishes a nmost deliglhtful p-romenade in
pleasant weather, and it is then thronged with crowds of persons, citizens
and strangers. The other principal streets run in the same directionl, anld are
intersected by others extending firom river to river.
NEW CUSTOM HIOUSE.
854. The city of New York hlas a number of fine buildings, among which,
the City Hall, on Broadway, is the most attractive and elegant. It is constructed of white marble, and the expense of it was about half a million of
dollars. The new Custom House which is now (1835,) being built, on the
corner of Wall and Nassau streets, " will, it is said, whenl completed, surpass every other edifice in the Union, f r permane;ice in the materials and
execution, as well as for its classicalbeauty." There are about 120 churches in the city. There are 70 weekly and 11 daily newspapers printed in
New York, and about 50 steamboats ply in its adjacent waters. On the
memorable night of Dec. 16th, 1835, there raged in this city, the most deMIDDLE STATES.                           121,tructive fire that ever occurred in the United States, or even on the American continent.*
855. ALBANY is advantageously situated, nearly at the head of sloop navigation on the Hudson, 160 miles from the sea. The facilities for trade, both
on account of its central position and its commercial advantages, so greatly
increased by means of canals, have raised it to an importance. in the State
aecond only to New York, and the eighth in the Union.
856. B-rooklyn, is situated on a little eminence at the west end of Long
Island, and comnmands a delightful view of New York city, from which it is
separated by the East river.
857. Newburg, Poughkeepsie,' Catskill, Hudson, Troy, and Lansingburg,
are thriving andiimportant places. Utica, Rochester, and Buffalo, are large
and flourishing towns. There are many other important places ill the interior and western parts of the state; most of which have grown up with astornishing rapidity. Rochester, which has now, [in 1835,] a population of upwards 14,000, was " in 1812, one wide and vast forest."

and from its proximity to New York and Philadelphia,
always finds a ready market for all its productions.         Its
commerce, which is small, is mostly carried on through

PENNSYLVANIA.
Map of the U. S.-How is Pennsylvania bounded? Its capital? Chief

865. PENNSYLVA:NIA        is a large, wealthy, and powerful state; has a healthy climate, and a fertile soil.
866. This state derives its name from its illusti0ous founder, William Penn,
who belonged to the denomination of Friends. The name is compounded of
Penn and sylva, a grove of wood, literally sitgnifying Penn's Woods.
867. The eastern, or south-eastern and western
parts, have a hilly, or moderately' uneven surface; and
a good and well cultivated soil. The interior is mountainous, with some      fertile valleyS, but in general, not
susceptible of a high state of cultivation, and it is accordingly less populous than the other parts.
868. This state is distinguished for its agricultural
and mineral products, for its commerce and manufac..
tures, in the last of which it exceeds in amount every
other state in the Union.
869. Its principal mineral productions, are     marble,
iron, and coal.     The coal mines are becoming exceedingly important, from      the improved mode of transportation by means of canals and rail-roads, for which this
state is distinguished.
870. About one half only of the population, are de.
scendants of English emigrants; about one fourth are
German, one eighth Irish; and Scotch, Welch, Swedes
and Dutch, make up the rest.

123124                      MIIDDLE STATES.
871. The Germans still speak their native language, and they have about 30
newspapers in the state, printed in that language.
872. rlThe first settlements in this state were made by William Penn, who
having obtained a patent from Charles II., Kinig of Enlgland, covering the
whole territory of the state, arrived in the country in 1682. Penn, doubting
his right to land, which he thus held from the English king, who founded his
claim merely on discovery and first possession, made a fair and honorable
purchase of it from the Indians, whom he very properly considered the lawful and rightful owners.
PENN'S TREATY.
873. Penn's policy was always of a pacific character. He early engaged
the Indians in a treaty of peace, made and concluded under the "Great Elm
Tree," at Kensington. This treaty, by means of the mild and equitable
course inculcated and practised by Penn, continued unbroken for about 70
years.
874. TOWNS. PHILADELPHIA is pleasantly situated on the west bank of
the Delaware, 126 miles firom its mouth, being between that river and the
Schuylkill, about seven miles above their confluence.
875. The plan of the city was originally a parallelogram, extending from
river to river, in length about two miles, and in width about one mile. As
the business of the city increased, the buildings were naturally extended
along the Delaware, and they now reach from the lower part of Southwark.
to the upper'part of Kensington, a distance of about four miles.
876. The city abounds in religious, literary, anid benevolent institutions.
and with schools of every grade, liberally supported.  By the legacy of the
late Stephen Girard, this city has received a munificent donation of several
millions of dollars, the annual proceeds of which are to be devoted to imp6rtant public objects. Among other noble bequests, he left a large sum to
found and support a college for the education of the poorer classes in society.

GIRARD COLLEGE.
877. It is one of the most regular cities in the world, being laid out in ex
act squares, having therefore its streets crossing each other at right angles
The streets are handsomely paved with round stones, are spacious, and present a remarkably neat appearance.
878. The houses are generally built of brick, three stories high,.with mar*ble steps and window-sills, exhibiting at once uniformity and durability.
879. The trade and commerce of the city are very extensive, and in manufactures it exceeds every other city in America. In the regularity and neatness of its streets, the beauty and uniformity of its buildings, Philadelphia
can scarcely be said to be surpassed by any American city.
880. Harrisburg, is a hanldsome town, pleasantly situated in a healthy and
fertile region on the river Susquehanna. The canal from Philadelphia to
Pittsburg passes through it.
881. Pittsburg, stands at the confluence of the Allegapy and Monongahela
rivers, 300 miles N. W. of Philadelphia, and from its situation is an important place. Its trade and manufactures are flourishing.

882. DELAWARE has the smallest population of any
state in the Union, and is likewise the smallest in size,
except Rhode Island.
883. The northern part of the state is hilly, with a
rich, clayey soil; the southern part is level, sandy, and
less productive.
884. It is noted for its fine wheat, its excellent flour
mills, and manufactories, but its commerce is inconsiderable.
885. Thq Delaware and Chesapeake Canal, crosses the northern part of
this State, shortening very much, the distance for sloops and small vessels,
which pass between Philadelphia and Baltimore.
886. TowNs. DOVER has a central situation in the state, on Jones' Creel,
a few miles from its entrance into Delfware Bay.
887. Wilmington is the most important town in the state. It carries on an
extealsive flour trade, and has numerous manufactories.

in this division.
889. That portion of the Southern States which ex.
tends along the Atlantic, varying in width from 50 to
100 miles, is a low, sandy plain; but little elevated
above the level of the sea, and is therefore called" Tho
Low Country." The country around the gulf of Mexico is likewise low and level.

ers being large, they necessarily live at considerable
distances from each other, and cultivate their lands
principally by the aid of negro slaves.
891. The low country abounds in forests of pitch-pine, called pine barrens,
and is most generally unproductive, except on the borders of rivers and
creeks where it is very fertile.
892. The country farther back from the coast first becomes elevated and
hilly, and then mountainous. The soil, in the upland regions, is in general
more fertile than that of the low country.
893. The climate, in the low country, is in summer,
hot and unhealthy; in winter, mild, with but little or no
snow. In the more elevated regions, the climate, in
summer, is milder and more salubrious than in the low
country.
894. The proprietors of the upland regions are
chiefly farmers with smaller estates, in general, and
fewer slaves, than are possessed by the planters in the
low country, and they frequently labor on their lands
themselves.
895. The richer class in these states are generally
intelligent, refined, and remarkably hospitable, but the
poor are usually rude and ignorant.
896. The southern     gentlemen are fond of amusements, among which, the pleasures of the chase are the
most attractive.
897. Tobacco, wheat, and lndian corn, are the principal productions of
the uplanld or northe'n parts, and cotton, rice, and sugar, of the less elevated
regions.
MARYLAND.
Map of the U. S.-How is Maryland bounded? Its capital? Chief'rowns? Principal.Rivers?
898. MARYLAND has for its most distinguishing natural
feature the Chesapeak Bay, which divides the state
into two parts, called the Eastern and Western Shores.
899. The whole of the Eastern Shore is low and
level, and a part of the Western     Shore, south of the
head of tide water of the bay. The parts above, are
first hilly, then mountainous.
900. In the elevated regions are some remarkably productive valleys, and
in g:neral, the soil is very good.
128SOUTHERN     STATES.                    129
901. The Chesapeak and Delaware Canal, which connects the north ends
of the bays of the same names, is partly in this State.
902 The Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road, from the waters of the Chesapeak across the Allegany mountains to the Ohio river, almost 350 miles in
length, is now [1835] in progress, and a considerable portion west of Baltimore is already finished, and in actual use. When completed, this will be
the most stupendous work ever undertaken in America.
903. Maryland is distinguished for great commercial
enterprize. The principal exports are flour and tobacco.
904. TowNs. ANNAPOLIS is situated on the Severn, 30 miles south o
Baltimore.
905. Baltimore, a city, stands on the north side of Petapsco river, 14 miles
above its entrance into Chesapeak Bay. It is advantageously situated for
commerce, both foreign and inland, and commands a great portion ofthe trada
of the adjacent states. The exports are principally flour, grain, tobacco, and
pork. It is one of the first flour markets in the world. The city contains many
maglnlificent buildings, and two splendid monuments, both of marble. One
was erected to the memory of those who fell in the battle at North Point, in
1814; the other to the memory of WASHINGTON. On the summit of the
last, is a statue of that illustrious man, the extreme height of which is 167
feet.

springs and green fertile spots. Each of these spots is called aii oasis; they resemble Islands in the ocean. When a large tract of country is exceedingly unproductive,
yielding only a few slsrubs or small trees, it is called a Desert; although it has
streams of water, and an uneven surface, as the great Desert of America.

sides of the Potomac, which passes through it diagonally' nearly in its centre.     It is about 120 miles from       the
mouth of that river, and nearly 300 from          the sea.    The
surface of the District is uneven, and the soil light and
sandy.
908. TowNs. WASHINGCTON, the capital of the United States, is situated
mon the MIaryland side of the Potomac river, 295 miles by the course of the
river and the Chesapeak bay from thle Atlantic. The site of the city is on a
point of land formed by the junctionl of the Potomac and its Eastern branlch,
and reaches along each stream for nearly two miles.
Its situation is pleasant and healthy, and its plan regular and extensive.
The houses are so scattered as to give the city almost the appearance of
several small anld distinct villages. Among the public buildings may be noticed the Capitol and.the President's house, both of which are situated on
little eminlences, a little more than a mile apart, and both visible at the sane
time frotn almost every part of' the city.
THIE CAPITOL.
The Capitol, in which building the Congress of the United States meets,
is the most superb edifice in America. It is built of white free stone, and is
362 feet in length. The President's house is also a very handsome structure.

910. VIRGINIA     is distinguished for being the largest
and  first settled  of any in the    Union; for being       the
birth place    of Washington, Jefferson, Madison           and
Monroe, four Presidents of the United States; for being
one of the most populous states, and among the first in
political importance and influence.
911. Virginia is naturally     divided into two portions,
by the Blue Ridge, a branch of the Allegany mountains.
The western division is hilly and mountainous, but the
eastern, though hilly in the interior, is level, low and
swampy near the coast. %
912. Wheat, tobacco, and Indian corn, are the staple
productions.     Coal, iron, and gold, recently discovered,
are found in this state, and there are also Salt Springs.
913. The Natural Bridge over Cedar Creek, 12 miles Si W. of Lexington,
is a great curiosity. The sides of the gap, or chasm, over which it extends
are almost perpendicular for a distanlce of more than 15 rods, or 250 feet,
being in width, at the bottom, 45 feet. Over this chasm a huge rock of limestone, 60 feet broad, in the middle, extenlds completely across, forming a.

spnctacle.
NATURAL BRIDGE.
914. In Virginia, and in most of the Southern States, the counties are not
divided into townships, as in the Northern States, and the Court House,
which is generally situated near the centre of the county, frequently has not'
houses enough around it to form a village.
915. TowNs. RICHMOND stands on the north side of James river, at the
Falls, 150 miles from its mouth. This river is navigable for ships nearly to
the city. It is advantageously situated for trade, and is surrounded with
romantic and beautiful scenery.
916. Norfolk, the principal sea-port town in the state, stands on the east
branch of Elizabeth river, 8 miles above its passage into Hampton Roads.
It has a good harbor and excels in commerce every other town in Virginia.
917. Yorktown, on York river, is memorable for the surrender of the
British army under Lord Cornwallis, in the revolutionary war.
918. Mount Vernon, formerly the residencq of GEORGE WASHINGTON, is
a pleasant eminence on the Potomac, 16 miles from Washington City.
Here his remains were deposited at his death, and his estate, inclnding his
mansion house and grounds, still belong to a branch of his family. -
919. Monticello, two miles from Charlottesville, is famous for having been
the seat of Thomas Jefferson, formerly President of the United States.

919. NORTH CAROLINA is a large state, anld          greatly
excels in agricultural productions.
920. Along the coast are numerous islands, and the
mouths of rivers are obstructed by sand bars, which
render access by water both difficult and dangerous.
Hence    the commerce of this state        is comparatively
small.
921. The western part of the state is mountainous and the interior hilly.
The coast for about 80 miles back is low and sandy, being covered in many
places with extensive pine -forests, which yield, in abundance, pitch, tar,
turpentine, and lumber. Cotton, rice, and tobacco, constitute, however, the
most valuable exports.
922. The Great Dismal Swamp extends through a
part of this state and a part of Virginia.
923. The gold mines of this state have recently attracted  much attention.      The gold is found      in grains
or masses from the smallest particles, to lumps weighing two pounds or more.

the other towns of the state together. It has a favorable situation for trade,
but anl unfavorable one for health.
927. Fayetteville, on Cape Fear river, has more inland trade than any other
town in the state.
928. Salem, 113 miles from Raleigh, is noted for being the principal town
of the iloravian settlement, and for being the seat of a Moravian Female
Academy, which has four buildings of brick, each four stories high.

931. In the alluvial or low country, negro slaves perform nearly all the
labor, being in that section of the state, more than three times as numerous
as the whites. This division, comprising less than one third of the territory
of the state, contains more than half the whole number of slaves, and but
about one fifth part of the white population of the state.
932. Although South Carolina has no g,od harbors,
it exc3ls in the value of its imports every southern Atlantic state.
933. The     white     opulation   consists principally      of
wealthy    planters or farmers.        The    slaves   comprise

cotton, which much excels that grown             in  the uplands.
Rice is also cultivated on these islands.
938. The climate resembles that of North and South
Carolina in its general characteristics.
939. Georgia has valuable gold mines, and numerous mineral springs which are considerably celebrated.
940. A swamp called the Okefenokee, extends through a part of this state
and a part of Florida, and is 180 miles in circumference. It is much infested with aligators, snakes, frogs, and myriads of moschetoes, which last insects are of no inconsiderable annoyance to the people in the vicinity during
the season of summer.
941. That part of Georgia nowv called the Western Counties has continued to be in the possession of the Creek and Cherokee tribes of Indians, till
within a recent period. The Creeks lately ceded their territory to the state,
and have emigrated to Alabama and to the Arkansas territory. Some of the
Cherokees have given up their lands and emigrated beyond the Mississippi.
The remaining portion of the tribe still reside in Georgia. In consequence
of the benevolent exertions of missionaries, the Cherokees have made further advancements in civilization than any other Indians in America.

LOUISIANA.
Map of the U. S.-How    is Louisiana bounded? Its capital? Chief
Towns? Principal Rivers?
956. LOUISANIA is the most southern state in the Union, exhibiting every variety of soil from        the most fer
tile to the most sterile.
957. Its surface     except a     small section in     the   N.
which is rather hilly, presents anunvaried level or plain,
consisting of marshes, swamps, prairies, alluvions and
forests of pine, hickory and oak.
958. The prairies are immense plains, chiefly covered with reeds, a species of coarse grass, 4 or 5 feet in height. Alluvions are level, fertile lands,
lying on the margins of rivers.
959. The land in Louisiana is oflen lower than the rivers, being protected
from inundation by levees, as they are called, which are large banks thrown
up by the sides of rivers. The levees on the margin of the Mississippi, are
in some places 40 feet high.
960. This stream does, notwithstanding, sometimes overflow its banks,
rising to the astonishing height of 60 feet above low water mark, and deluging of course an immense extent of country.
961. By an actual survey, made by order of the general government, five
millions of acres were found subject to periodical inundations from this river, and the greater part consequently rendered unfit for cultivation. ~ On its
banks is found some of the best land in the world.
962. The staple production of the state of Louisiana,
is sugar; cotton is also cultivated, and rice in the low
country; oranges flourish in the southern part of tho
state.
963. Its commercial and agricultural resources are
ilimense; its climate warm, and in            many    places unhealthy.
964. The whole country belonging to the United States, west of the Mississippi now comprising a part of Louisiana, the state of Missouri, and the
Territories of Arkansas and Missouri, formerly belonged to France, and was
called Louisiana, in honor of her king, Louis XV. In 1803, France ceded it
to the United States for fifteen millions of dollars.
965. TowNs. NEW    ORLEANS, is situated on the east side of the Mississippi river, 105 miles by the course of that river from its mouth. The
city is lower than the levee on the margin of the river, or even than the
river itself when high, so that all the streets have a gradual ascent of several
feet as they approach the river. It possesses superior advantages for commerce, commanding an inland navigation by steamboats of more than 20,000

miles. If we add to this the vast extent and the amazing fertility of the
great lMississippi Valley, the trade of which it concentrates, the increasing
facilities which will probably be afforded by rail-roads and canals, it is obvious that in commercial importance, New Orleans must equal, at no very
distant period, any city on the Globe. It already excels every other city in
the United States, except New York, in the amount of its exports of domestic produce.
966. Some idea may be formed of the immense trade of the city of New
Orleans, from the fact that not unfrequently there may be seen at one time
engaged in lading and unlading, 1500 flat boats, 50 steam-boats, besides

968. THE TERRITORY oF FLORIDA, like most of the
southern part of the Union, has a low country which is
sandy, marshy, and barren; and the soil of the Territory generally, is not remarkably fertile.
969. In the interior, which is more elevated than the low country, the soil
becomes better, and in the northern parts, there are some fertile tracts.
970. Cotton, rice, sugar, indigo, oranges, figs, and
olives, are the principal productions.

Missouri, and the Oregon; all except tne last lying
in the valley of the Mississippi.
975. The Mississippi Valley, so called from the river of that name, embraces all that vast tract of country which is watered by the Mississippi and its numerous branches, between the Alleghany and Rocky Mountains, being more than 3000 miles wide.
976. The Western States are distinguished for their
large and navigable rivers, their united length amounting to more than 20,000 miles; for their extensive
prairies; for their mild and generally healthy climate
and fertile soil; for having been the latest settled grand
division of the Union; and the unexampled rapidity of
thleir increase in population, wealth, and political importance.
977. The surface is generally level, abounding in
prairies, except in the eastern parts of Tennessee and
Kentucky; though there are no considerable mountains
even in those States.
978. The Western States have a great variety of
climate, being in the south warm, and in the north cold.
The temperature of winter varies more, and the quan.
tity of snow is less, than in the same parallels, in the
Atlantic States. The climate may generally be called
healthy, though some parts are not so, especially in thi
vicinity of swamps and marshy prairies.
979. Owing to their recent and rapid settlement, the
Western States have comparatively few settled ministers, and but few schools, though the latter are rapidly
increasing, provision being made in many sections for
their establishment by law.
980. This division of the United States abounds in tumuli, or mounds of
earth, which appear to be the remains of forts or ancient fortifications, indiWESTERN STATES, Q. Where are the Western States situated 1 974. What

cating the existence of a civilized people long before the discovery of this
continent by Columbus.
981. The prairies, called in Asia, steppes, and in South Americapampas,
are low and sometimes marshy plains, frequently extending further than the
eye can reach, and affording rich pastures for immense herds of Buffaloes or
bisons, elk, deer, and horses. The whole plain sometimes appears almost
black with buffaloes, there being, as is asserted, as many as 10,000 in some
single herds.
A BUFFALO HUNT.
982. The Indians hunt these buffaloes on horseback and kill them, either
by piercing them with their arrows, or by driving them down deep precipices
where they are killed by the fall.
983. The principal products of the soil are wheat
Indian corn, cotton, tobacco, and hemp.
984. The Mississippi, which name, in the language of the natives, signifies
the Father of Waters, is the principal river of the Westein States. It rises
in the marshes and swamps of the unexplored regions north-west of the
United States, and receives in its course a vast number of large and navigable streams. The great Mississippi Valley is drained by this river, the wa
ters of which are compressed into an astonishingly deep and narrow chan
nel of only about half a mile in width, being unquestionably, in proportion
to the volume of water which it bears to the ocean, the narrowest river on
the globe.
985. Its course is so exceedingly crooked, forming a continual succession
of uniform curves at such regular intervals, that the natives used to determine their progress up and down the river by the number of the bends which
they had passed.
986. The Missouri is the largest tributary stream of the Mississippi, and
even larger than the Mississippi itself at their confluence, so that it looses its
name in an inferior stream. The length of the Missouri, added to that of the
Mississippi, after their junction, would make a distance of almost 4500 miles,
a greater length than that of any other river in the world.

987. The lMissouri is formed by three head streams, niamely, Je-ffRsonl.
Madison, and Gallatin, so called by Lewis and Clarke, their discoverers.
The sources of these streams, which are in.the Rocky MIountains, are so
near the sources ofthe Columbia river, which flows into the Pacific, that a..
person may drink from the springs of each without travelling more than'a
mile.
This stream has a more rapid current than the Mississippi, and is therefore
more difficult of ascent.
988. The MIississippi is navigable to the Falls of St. Anthony, about 2000
miles from its mouth, but the navigation is much obstructed by sawyers, snags,
falling banks, &amp;c.
989. By sawyers are meant large trees whose roots are at the bottom, and
whose tops are at the surface of the river; by snags, trees, stumps, roots&amp;c. at the bottom; and by falling banks, great masses of the bank with large
trees growing on them falling suddenly into the river. These impediments
are now much less numerous aud much less dangerous thanl formerly, owing
to exertions made to remove them.
STEAMIBOAT LADEN WITH COTTON DESCENDING TIIE MIssISSIPPI.
990. Formerly a passage up this stream by keel boats and flat boats, to tlhe
mouth ofthe-Ohio, 960 miles, occupied 8 or 10 weeks; now the same is
performed by steamnboats in as many days.
991. In 1810 was seen the' first steamboat on this or its tributary streamsq
now there are more than 160, besides about 500 flat boats, which annually descend the stream. Theseboats give4 employment to about 40,0.
men.
992. If we consider the numerous branches which the Mississippi has
which are each several times larger than the Connecticut, also the vast number about the same size, besides innumerable smaller ones, we may havs
some idea what an immense mass of water must swell the Mississippi for
many miles above its mouth.

993. The change which takes place in the waters of thle Mississippi, after
the junction with the Missouri, its rival stream, is worthy of notice. From a
clear, gentle, and smoothly gliding stream, it immediately becomes a muddy
rapid, and foaming mass of waters, sweeping and rushing along into the GAui
of Mexico.

1010. OHIO is situated     between Lake Erie      on the
N. and the Ohio river on the S., and is the most populous of all the Western States. On the S. it gradually inclines towards the river, and on the N. towards the
lake.
1011. The southern parts are hilly, but not mountainous; the northern, level, and in many parts marshyv
1012. The great fertility of its soil and the mildness
of its climate have attracted emigrants in such numbers, that it has outstripped every Western State, in
the rapid increase of its population, in which it ranks as
the fourth State in the Union.
1013. In agriculture, manufactures, and       commerce,
it excels many of the older Atlantic States.
1014. Wheat is the staple production. Indian corn,
rye, barley, oats, and hemp, are also extensively raised.
Indian corn not unfrequently yields from 50 to 100
bushels to the acre.
1015. Ohio has mines of pit coal, and numerous salt
springs..  The State takes its name from the Ohio river,
one of the most beautiful streams in the world.
1016. The northern declivity, bordering on the lake, forms what was
formerly called New Connecticut, but is better known now as the Western
Reserve, and contains three millions of Acres. It belonged to Connecticut
and many parts of it have been sold by that State, mostly to native emi.

river, 122 miles above Louisville, 455 below Pittsburg by the course of the
river, and 300 by land. It is the greatest emporium ofthe western country,
and ncxt to New Orleans. much the largest town in the United States, west
of the Allegany mountains. The city is advantageously and beautifully
situated. It stands partly on the first and partly on the second bank, as they
are called, the lower being about 50 or 60 feet above the river, at low water
mark, and the upper bank about the same distance above the lower. The
greatest difference between high and low water mark is about 5S feet; but
in February, 1832, the Ohio rose to the unprecedented height of 64 feet above
low wvater mark, causing much damage to this city, especially on the lower
bank.
1019. The growth of Cincinnati in population, trade, and commerce has
been exceedingly rapid. In 1800, only 36 years ago, it contained but 750
persons; now it has about 30,000. It is extensively engaged in trade and
manufactures, and may justly be considered one of the most flourislhing cities
in the United States.

interior, being traversed by the Ozark Mountains, is
more elevated, healthy, and pleasant.
1042. The western part has immense prairies, over which roam in vast
herds, wild horses, buffaloes or bisons, elks, and deer.
1043. The land bordering on the rivers is very fertile. Tobacco, cotton,
wheat, maize, and rice, are the principal productionis.
1044. The Arkansas is the chief river in the State, and is navigable by
steamboats, when high, nearly to the mountains.
1045. Salt and hot springs abound in this State. The latter are much
fiequentedfor their medicinal qualities, and the water in some of them is
said to be hot enough to boil an egg.

1074. Lower Canada produces wheat, maize, and
other articles common to the United           States.     The exports are grain, flour, lumber, furs, pot and pearl ashes.
1075. The Falls of Montmorenci, 8 miles below Quebec, are worthy of
notice. The river falls over a precipice of about 245 feet perpendicular
descent, presenting a wonderful scene of grandeur and beauty.
1076. The Canadas were first settled by the French in 1608, but with
Quebec fell into the hands of the English in 1759, who have since kept pos.
session of the whole country.
1077. TowNS. QUEBEc is the capital, not only of Canada, but of all
British America. It is built on a promontory on the N. W. bank of the St.
Lawrence, at the confluence of the St. Charles with that river, nearly 400
miles from the sea. It is divided into the Upper and Lower towns, the former
being built upon the summit of a rock of marble and slate, and the latter
round the base of the eminence.
1078. The fortifications of Quebec are worthy the attention of travellers.
The citadel in the Upper town has been building for several years, and is designed to be of impregnable strength. The rock comprises an area of five
or six acres, enclosed by a wall forty feet high, with a deep ditch in ~font, 50
feet wide, blasted out of solid rock. Near the city lie the celebrated plains
of Abraham, the scene of a battle in which the brav;e English General,
Wolfe, and the no less brave French General, Montcalm, at the head of their
respective armies, met, fought, and died, the former in the moment of victory.
This event decided the fate of Quebec, which, from that time, September,
1759, passed from the possession of the French into that of the English, wko
have retained it to this day.
1079. Montreal, on an island of the same name in the St. Lawrence, 180
miles by the course of the river above Quebec, has an extensive commerce,
being the great emporium of the fur trade in that country, and also of the
trade betweenl the United States and Canada. From this place to Quebec,
on the margin of the river, the country for about a mile in breadth, comprises
the more populous parts of Lower Canada, and indeed all that may be called
inhabited. This strip, for its whole length, has the appearance of one conr,.
tinued village.

Wild animals, such as bears, beavers, moose, otters, martins, foxes, &amp;c. are
numerous.
1110. In winter, the inhabitants, wrapped in furs and skiins, travel in sledges drawnv by dogs at the rate of 60 miles in a day. In summer they cross the
streamis in canoes made of birch bark, so light that they carry them on their
shoulders with their baggage besides.
1111. The Esquimauxl Indians inhabit the coast, and rove from place to
place, without any fixed habitation. They are of a brown color, small in
stature; filthy and disgusting in their appearance, and employ themselves
principally in hunting and fishing. They eat their food raw, in which they
differ from all other native Americans. They are so savage, covetous, faithless and mischievous, as to render it difficult to have much trade or commerce with them.

these animals and the whale fishery on the coast.
DANGERS OF THE GREENLAND WHALE FISHERY.
1116. The Greenlanders are of low stature, rude,
and ignorant; living almost wholly on the flesh of animals, and clothing themselves with their skins.        They
are supposed to be in number about 20,000.

1119. MExico was discovered by the Spaniards, and
remained for nearly three centuries a Spanish province; but in   1812 it became an independent republic,
resembling in its main features, the government of the
United States.
1120. The States of Mexico lie at about an equal
distance from Europe and Asia, and their shores are
washed by two oceans.
1121. The surface on both coasts is low       and level
gradually rising towards the interior, till it reaches the
height of 7000 feet, or about one mile and one third,
where it abruptly spreads out into broad and extensive
plains, some of which are sixteen or seventeen hundred
miles in   length, forminig    what   are   called  "Table
Lands;" aremarkable spectacle on the summits of lofty
mountains.
1122. The low land is hot and unhealthy; the interior less so, and at an
elevation of 5000 feet, or about one mile, the atmosphere is bland and delightful, possessing the characteristics of uninterrupted spring.

1&amp;2 Mountairi ~ 1123166                          MEXICO.
1123. From the surface of the Table Lands there often shoot up peaks of
mountains to a great elevationl, their tops being covered with perpetual snow.
The highest of these is Popocatapetl, which is about 17,000 feet, almost 31
miles above the level of the sea. This peak, as well as several others in the
vicinity, is volcanic.
1124. The soil of the country for the most part, is
exceedingly productive, yielding two or three crops of
Indiai corn in a year.1125. The other principal productions are tobacco, indigo, sugar, cotton,
mahogany, logwood, and a great variety of fruit and grain. The agave or
American aloe, the liquor of which is calledpulque, is extensively cultivated.
1126. Mexico has been celebrated for its silver mines, which are the richest
in the world, yielding an annual income of about 22 millionls of dollars, ten
times as much as all the mines of Europe. One of these mines is regarded
as a great curiosity, being excavated about eight miles in length, and over
1600 feet in depth.
1127. This country, previous to its discovery and conquest by the Spaniards, under Fernando Cortez, was the seat of a powerful and civilized empire, governed by the famous Montezuma. By what means the aborigines
attained to the degree of refinement in which they were found, is still a matter of uncertainty, as is also their origin in this country.
1128. The only religion which is tolerated here is
the Roman Catholic.          The number of -clergy is about
10,000, including four thousand monks and nuns.
1129. More than onle third of the inhabitants are subdued Indians, nearly one quarter whites, of European
extraction, and the rest mnixed races.
1130. TowNs. MEXIco, the metropolis of the whole MIexican republic,
is the oldest, and one of the most populous cities in America. It is situated
midway between the oceans, near Lake Tezeuco, in a most delightful valley,
230 miles in circumference, and bordered by high ranges of mountains, at an
elevation of about 7,500 feet, or more than one and a halfmiles above the level
of the sea.
1131. The city is laid out in an exact square, each side being four miles in
length, and is, says Humboldt, " one of the finest cities ever built by Europeans in either hemisphere." It is remarkable for its regular and wide streets,
its uniform and splendid edifices, and for having the richest mint' in the world.
The city is said to contain no less than 20,000 beggars, called leperos, who are
miserable beings.
1132. Puebla,' the next city in population, is situated on a plain nearly as
high as Mexico, and 70 miles S. E. of it.
1133. Guan(xato' and Zacatecas are celebrated for their rich silver mines,
and Xalapa4 or Jalapa for producing and giving name to the purgative xalap
now writtenjalap, much used in medicine.

WEST INDIES.
1140. The West Indies are a large collection of islands between North and South America. The Bahamas are the most northern, Ferdinand the most southern, Barbadoes the      most eastern, and Cuba the most
western.
1141. They were called Indies by Columbus, who believed them to be a
part of India, whlich was the object of his search. When tile mistake was discovered they retained the name, the term West being prefixed, to distinguish
them from the Indies of the eastern hemisphere, which are now calleu East
Indies.
1142. The West Indies are divided into four groups,
Great and Little Antilles, Bahamas, and Caribbean
Islands.
1143. The seasons, as in other tropical regions, are
divided into wet and dry. The climate in summer is
excessively hot and unhealthy; in wvinter mild and
healthy, being from    December to May, the finest winter on the globe.
1144. In mid-summerthe nights are eminently beautiful; the moon is so
brilliant that the smallest print is legible by her light, and in her absence her
place is supplied by the brightness of the Milky Way, and the radiance of the
planet Venus, which is such as to cast a shade. This is succeeded by the
autumnal rains and sickly season.
1145. Between the months of August and October, the islands are visited
with tremendous hurricanes, which oftentimes do extensive injury to ships,
towns and villages.

which are manufactured sugar, molasses, and that poisonous drink, ruim.
Cotton, coffee, indigo, pimento, cocoa, medicinal drugs, tobacco, maize,
guava, plantain, &amp;c. are extensively cultivated. Oranges, lemons, limes,
pomegranates, citrons, pine-apples, &amp;c. grow in greatperfection; also yams,
potatos, &amp;c.
1147. The numbei of inhabitants is reckoned at about 3,000,000, of whom
2,500,000 are Blacks, and about 500,000 WIVites. The blacks are mostly
slaves except in Hayti, anld the islands belonging to Great Britain. By a late
act of the British Parliament, which took effect in! AuLgust, 1834, neatly
700,000 slaves were set at liberty on these islands.

quills 3 feet in length, and its wings, when extended, measure about 13 feet.
1159. The climate iln the south is cold, much more
so throutghout the peninsula than in other regions in the
same latitude, and is for the most part salubrious, except
in the low   plains, where it is hot and       frequently unhealthy.
1160. Even under the equator, the heat is not very oppressive, owing to
the elevation of the country, and its narrowness in this part.
1161. The population is composed           of Whites, Indians, Negroes, Mulattoes, Mestizoes, and Samboes;
making in all about 15 millions, with space and fertile
soil enough for.the support of more than 500 millions.
1162. The whites are mostly Creoles, or those born in America, and Cha
patones, or those born in Spain. The mulattoes are descendants of whites
and negroes, the mestizoes of whites and Indians, and the samboes of negroes
and Indians.

1163. The higher classes are well educated, though the standard of moral
ity is not high, and the lower classes are both ignorant and vicious.
1164. Since the South American States, which formerly were chiefly in the possession of Spain and Portugal, have become independent republics, they have
given much at,ention to the subject of education.            The
result of this has been the establishment in various places
of schools and universities.
1165. The Andes of South          America is an immense
chain of mountains, extending throughout its whole
length from   N. to S., varying from     50 to 150 mliles from
the sea coast, and so high as to be visible 180 miles from
the shore.
1166. Formerly, Chimborazo was considered their highest peak, but late
siveys make Sorato, in Bolivia, the most elevated point, being 25,250 feet,
almost 5 miles, above the level of the sea, a few feet lower than Jahavah,
that lofty peak of the HIimmaleh Mountains in Asia.
1167. The Andes have a vast many other points of prodigious height,
which, even in the torrid zone, are covered with perpetual snow, at an elevation of 15,000 feet, or about 3 miles, the point fixed on by Humboldt as the
snow line under the equator.
1168. The people of New England look on the White Mountains as a
grand and sublime spectacle; with what admiration and wonder then must
a person gaze on the lofty Anldes, which rise almost four times as high!
From their summit, no one has as yet been permitted to look, on account of
their steep and lugged ascent as well as from the peculiar state of the atmosphere, which in regions less elevated, causes fainting, and the blood to
spirt from one's face, as was the case with Humboldt and his companions.
1169. The Andes are volcanic throughout almost their whole extent, and
in many places eruptions are constant. Among them is Cotopaxi, the most
fonmidable and the most elevated on the globe. The flames from this peak
have been kiown to rise to the astonishing height of 3000 feet, nearly one
mile above its crater, and its "roarings have been heard at the distance of
600 miles."*
1170. When Humboldt, in ascending the Andes, had reached the crater of
Pinchincha, he climbed a rock hanging over it, and looked down upon the
mouth of the volcano, which he describes as being a large black and yawning
gulf, so immense that the. summits of other mountains might be distinctly
seen within it.

Map of S. America.--How is Columbia bounded? Its capital? Chief
Towns? Principal Rivers?
1172. COLOMBIA      in 1829 was divided into the three
republics of NEW      GRENADA, VENEZUELA, and EQUATOR, which are the present divisions of the country.
1173. THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA, as it recently existed, was composed of the countries previously known as New Grenada, and Caraccas, or
Venezuela. The north-west part was formerly called Terra Firma, and the
south-western once formed the province of Quito.
1174. The surface of Colombia in the west is mountainous; in the east, it consists of vast plains, and on
the Oronoco it is much subject to inlundation.
1175. Colombia has every variety of climate from
intolerable heat and uninterrupted summer to perpetual
snow. Except in the low land, it is generally healthy.
1176. Most of the      soil, especially  the valleys    and
plains, produce grain, cotton, coffee, cocoa, tobacco,
and indigo.    These articles, with hides and cattle, constitute the chief exports.
1177. The Congress of Colombia in 1828 made provision that the avails
of the convents, which had been suppressed, should be applied to the support of a university in every department, a college in every provincial capi.
tal, a grammar school in every canton, and a primary school in every parish,
being the most extensive system of education ever planned.
1178. Tequendama, on the river Bogota, 15 miles S. W. of the City or
Bogota, is one of the most extraordinary cataracts in the world. The river
which just above the Falls is 140 feet wide, is suddenly compressed to 35
feet, and rushes perpendicularly down a rock, making at two rsounds a descent of nearly 600 feet into an unfathomable abyss.

1179. In the isthmus of Darien or Panama is a chain
of mountains throuighout its whole length, serving the
purpose of an      eternal barrier      between     its adjacent
oceans.
1180. The natives ot the        country wear no clothes,
amd in many places build their huts upon the trees, to be
elevated from the damp soil and the reptiles engendered
in the putrid waters.
1181. TowNs. SN TA FE DE BOGOTA or BOGOTA, the capital of New
Grenada, is situated in the midst of a large and fertile plain, which is elevated about 8500 feet.above the level of the sea.
1182. Quito', the largest city in the three divisions of Colombia, and the
capital of the Republic of the Equator, is situated on the side of the volcanic
mountain Pinchinca, 9500 feet, or nearly two miles above the level of the
sea. This city, notwithstaniding its proximity to the equLator, has, on account
of its elevation, a mild and delightfil climate. It is subject to dreadful
earthquakes and tempests, on which account the houses are generally built
but one story high.

1183. GUIANA was formerly a larger country than at
present, comprising not only its present divisions of
English, Dutch, and French Guiana, but also         Spanish
and Portuguese Guiana. These are now included, the
former in Colomibia, the latter in Brazil.
1184. Guiana has mostly a level surface, a fruitful
soil, and a hot, unhealthy climate.
1185. The    productions are     sugar,  coffee,  cotton,
maize, cocoa, and indigo.
1186. TOWNS. STABROEIC1 is the capital of English Guiana, PARAMARIBo, on Surinam river, of Dutch Guiana, and CAYENNE,2 the capital of

1187. PEIRU was the seat of the famous empire of the
Incas, who commenced their reign in the twelfth century.  Their subjects, the Peruvians, had       attained  to a
degree of civilization surpassing all the other tribes in
America.
1188. Peru was conquered by the Spaniards, under Pizarro, who treated
the innocent natives with great cruelty. It then formed a Spanish viceroyalty, and so continued till within a few years, when it became an independent
republic.
1189. This country is distinguished for its rich mines
of gold, silver, mercury, and lead.

all over the world.
1191. The Andes intersect Peru, and their summits
are covered with perpetual snow.
1192. The eastern portion of the country is flat, consisting of pampas, or
vast plains, covered only with grass, and occupied solely by Indians.
1193. The middle region, lying between two ridges of the Andes, has, for
the most part, a fertile soil, and in consequence of its great elevation, a mild
and healthy climate.
1194. Near the base of the mountains are vast sandy plains or deserts,
with a sickly climate, anld without any sunshine for more than six months of
the year. Rain seldom falls in Peru.
1195. Peru has a thin population, and no good'roads, bridges, or canals,
all articles being generally transported on the backs of mules and lamas.
1196. TowNs. LIMA, the capital of Peru, has a most delightful situation
in the midst of a spacious valley, 700 feet above the level of the sea, and
about 8 miles from it. The city, which is in the form of a triangle, and laid
out in squares, is wholly surrounded by a massive brick wall with seven
gates for entrances. The houses are low, generally but one story high, and
covered with coarse linen cloth or reeds, without any regard to rain, which
seldom falls here.
1197. Cusco or Cuzco, the ancient capital of the Empire of the Incas, was
founded, it is said, by Marco Capac, the firs Inca of Peru, who, together withl
his wife, claimed to have descended from the moon. The buildings are of
stone, and its cathedral is a most superb edifice. It is a large town, and
contains numerous monuments of ancient splendor.

two-fifths of the whole peninsula.
1199. It has in general a healthy          climate, a fertile
soil, and a diversified surface of mountains and valleys,
hills and plains. The scenery of the country is represented as beautiful.
1200. There is scarcely to be found on the globe a finer country than Brazil, one blessed with a more genial climate, a more fertile soil, a greater
number of navigable rivers, or more famed for the production of gold and
diamonds. Silver is also found, and besides diamonds, many other precious
stones, as emeralds, crystals, &amp;c. Hindostan is the only country, except
Brazil, that produces diamonds.
1201. The principal productions are            cotton, sugar,
coffee, grain, and tropical fruits, besides various kinds of
dye-woods.
1202. Immense herds of cattle are found in the interior of the country
and also wild horses, which are hunted for their hides only.
1203. The parts along the coast, and in'the S. E. are settled by the whites;
the rest of the country is occupied by Indians who live in open hostility with
the whites.
1204. Brazil was first settled by the Portuguese, and therefore became a
colony of Portugal. In 1806, the King of Portugal, with his family, emigrated to Brazil, and resided there till 1821, which is the only instance of any
portion of America being governed by a king in person. In 1821, the king
returned to Portugal, and in the same year, independence was declared, and a
limited monarchy established. Don Pedro, the son of the king mentioned
above, was called to the throne, but has recently abdicated it in favor of his
son, and returned to Europe and has since died.
1205. TOWNS. Rio JANEIRO is delightfully situated on a small bay, 3
miles wide in front of the city, at the mouth of the river Rio Janeiro. The
bay forms one of the best harbors in the world, and is, with the city, surrounded by a lofty mountain, which gives to the bay the appearance of a fine
lake. The adjacent scenery is represented as inimitably beautiful. This
city, as well as Pernambuco, is a large and flourishing place, and has an e-s
tensive commerce.

Buenos Ayres, became independent a few years since, assuming its present
name in honor of the late Gen. Simon Bolivar, generally known by the
name of the Liberator.
1207. Its soil and productions are similar to those of

UNITED PROVINCES.
Map of South Amnerica.-How are the United Provinces bounded? Its
capitals? Chief Towns? Principal Rivers?
1211. THE UNITED PRovINcEs, as they recently existed, comprised the Argentine Republic, the Republic of
Uruguay, and the Dictatorship           or State of Paraguay,
which are now separate and independent states.
1212. This country was previously known, 1st, as Spanish America; 2d,
as Buenos Ayres; 3d, as the United Provinces of South America, and 4th, as
the Argentine Republic, and sometimes as the Reputblic of Buenos Ayres.
1213. These    provinces have generally      a scattered
population, and extensive    portions are known      only to
roving Indians.
1214. The northern        part is mountainous, gradually
declining in the central and southern parts, where the
country seems spread out into extensive plains called
pampas, resembling the western prairies of the United
States.
1215. These plains are clear of wood, and covered with high grass, es
tending further than the eye can reach; being in some places more than
1000 miles long, and 500 miles wide. Onl these plains immense herds of
cattle and wild horses graze and range, and are often hunted for their skins
only. "It has been calculated that 12,000,000 horned cattle and 3,000,000
horses, besides great numbers of sheep roam in these vast natural pastures."
1216. The chief sources of wealth to the inhabitants
consist in vast herds of cattle, horses, and mules. The
exports are hides, tallow and beef.
1217. This country has in general a healthy climate
and a fertile soil, which is capable of producing various
kinds of fruits and vegetables, common to the torrid and
temperate zones. The subject of agriculture has received but little attention.
1218. In Paraguay there is a celebrated production called lIalle, or Paraguay tea. It is exported in large quantities to various parts of South America, where it is much prized.
1219. The population of Paraguay is about 150,000,
of whom 5000 only are whites, the rest are Mestizoes
and Indians, a simple and inoffensive race. All the

powers of governlment have become by various revolutions, concentrated in the hands of one man, Doctor
Francia, who rules with absolute sway under the title
of Dictator.
1220. He maintains a most rigid police in every part of his dominions,
and has prohibited all intercourse with foreigners; and interdicted the entrance of the citizens of neighboring provinces into his territories under the
penalty of death, and those of all other countries, of perpetual detention.
1221. His regime though rigid is paternal, and his people appear happy.
There is perfect security of person and property; lyceums and public schools
are every where established; and every inhabitant is required to know how
to read, write, and keep accounts. Every body is compelled to work, and
mendicity is unknown. ASSUmPCION is the capital, and a limited foreign
trade, which is regulated by treaty, is permitted through the towns of Itapua
and New Coimbra on the frontiers of Brazil.
1222. TowNs. BUENOS AYRE s,1 so called from the purity of the atmosphere, is the capital of the Argentine Republic, and stands on the river La
Plata, about 180 miles from its mouth. The dwelling houses are about 6,500
in numnber, and mostly built of brick. The public buildings are of beautiful
white stone, found near the city. The river is thirty miles wide here, but
the frequent storms render the navigation dangerous, and a, large sand bank
in front of the city, prevents the approach of large ships within 8 miles of it.
The commerce, population, and wealth of Buenos Ayres, are rapidly increasing.
1223. MONTE VIDEO,2 the capital of Uruguay, has an excellent harbo,
and a considerable trade in hides, tallow and dried beef.

lying between the Andes on the E., and the Pacific on
the W., gradually rising in elevation as it recedes from
tie coast and approaches the mountains.           It is fertilized and beautified    by  numerous rivers, about 50 of
which flow into the Pacific.
1225. The climate is remarkably pleasant and salubrious; the weather generally serene, and the soil exceedingly fertile, being one of the most delightful countries on the globe.
1226. It however rarely rains in the northern parts, and in some parts
never, its place being supplied by abundant dews. Earthquakes, as well as
volcanoes, are common; 14 of the latter in the Andes are said to be in a
state of constant eruption..
1227. Chili is rich in mines of gold, silver, copper,
tin, and iron, anid produces plentifully, maize, rye, barley,
pulse, wine, oil, sugar, cotton, and fruits of various kinds.
1228. The Auricanians, a celebrated tribe of Indians,
inhabit the southern part of Chili. They are enthusiastically attached to liberty and have never been conquered.

EUROPE.
1232. EUROPEr, the smallest grand division of the
globe, lies principally in the North Temperate Zone,
extending about 3000 miles from E. to W., and about
2500 miles from N. to S. It contains nearly 3- millions
of square miles, and about 200 millions of inhabitants.
1233. Europe is distinguished for the learning, refinement, bravery, and enterprise of its inhabitants; for the
salubrity of its climate, and general fertility of its soil;
for the flourishing condition of the arts and sciences;
its extended commerce; its numerous, large and well

built cities, and its political influence, by which it has
heretofore controlled, in a great degree, the other divisions of the globe.
1234. The climate is much milder than that of Asia
or America in the same latitude, and is naturally divided
into three regions:
1235. 1st. The Warm region, below 480 N. laL,
which has a pleasant spring, a warm summer, and a
short winter, producing the olive, vine, mulberry, and
orange, the last in a wild state.
1236. 2d. The temperate region, from 48 to 650 N.
lat., where grain, grass, fruits, and esculent vegetables
flourish.
1237. 3d. The cold region, from 650 to the extreme
north, where nothing but reindeer-moss and a few stinted shrubs caii grow, and few animals, except the rein~
deer, can live.
1238. The means of a common education are not so
generally diffused in Europe as in the United States.
The higher and wealthier classes enjoy advantages
greatly superior; they esteem no expense too great to
secure a liberal and polished education.
1239. In some parts of Europe the lower classes are
extremely ignorant, it being as difficult to find a person
among them who can read or write, as it is to find one
in New England who cannot do both. The best provision made for instructing the common people is in
Scotland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland,
and Prussia. In many of these countries, particularly
in Scotland and Prussia, there are parish schools similar
to the common district or public schools in the United
States.

in any other part of the world, owing in a great mieasure
to the exclusive attention which they are encouraged
to bestow on a single subject or pursuit.
1241. Europe has numerous colleges or universities
which are on a mtich larger scale than those in the
United States, containing frequently from two to three
thousand students.
1242. The political divisions of Europe are the three
empires of Austria, Russia, and Turkey; seventeen
kingdoms, namely, Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway,
Sardinia, the two Sicilies, Greece, Prussia, Bavaria,
Saxony, Hanover, and Wirtemberg, besides about 40
small states, being principally duchies, principalities, &amp;c.
1243. The mnost powerful nations, sometimes known
as the five great powers, are Russia, Great Britain,
France, Austria, and Prussia. The nations which excel
in the number of their scientific and learned men, are
the English, French, and German.
1244. The prevailing religion of Europe is the
Christian, except in Turkey, where the Mohamedan is
established.

LAPLAND HUTS.
1245. LAPLAND is divided into three parts called
Russian Lapland in the E., Swedish Lapland in the S.,
and Danish, or Norwegian, Lapland in the N.
1246. Lapland lies principally in the Frigid Zone,
aid comprises all the northern part of Europe which
is west of the 5White sea, being the most northerly division.. It is a cold, dreary, and barren country, thinly
inhabited, without any towns larger than small villages,

and though equal to France in extent, its population
does not exceed 65,000.
1247. The Laplanders are of low stature, dark complexion, ignorant and superstitious, but great patriots,
and happy in their way.
1248. In summer they live in tents, in winter, in huts sunk in the ground
covered with birch-twigs and earth, with a hole in the top for the smoke to
escape. They build their fires in the middle of these huts, around which
tlhey set on their heels. At their meals they place their food on the ground,
and take it with their fingers.
1249. The chief wealth of Lapland consists in reindeer, which are used
fr' food, clothing, beasts of burden, travelling on sledges which they will
drag 60 or 100 miles in a day. A wealthy Laplander often owns a thousand or more of these animals.
1250. TowNs. The capital of Russian Lapland is KOLA, and of Swedish Lapland, TORNEA.

nTo   THE LEARNER. Having been made acquainted with the shlale of every
Natural Division from the smallest to the largest, also with the relative situation of
many of them, you are prepared anld doubtless desirous of knowing what the whlole
will make when put together. The following picture represents in a single view,
Oceans, Continents, Seas, Islands, Rivers, &amp;c. as forming one great mass of matter
called the Earth or the World on which we live.

a few  places in the    south, an   exceedingly    barren regon;    though    abounding    in   beautiful   and   sublime
scenery.
1252. It has extensive forests of pine, oak, elmn, and
fir, and the birch suLpplies them     both with fuel and        a
species of wine.
1253. The chief sources of wealth to the Norwegians are   timiber from    the  forests,  large   quantities of
which are exported, fisheries, and mines of iron, copper,
and silver.
1254. The    Norwegians are       an  honest, frugal, and
courageous people, generally well versed in the common branches of education.
1255. On the coast of Norway is a celebrated vortex or whirlpool called

1261. The lakes form the most interesting natural feature of Sweden,
b:fing sheets of pure, transparent water, and filled with fish. Lake Wetter
is remarkable for receiving 40 rivers, though ithas but one outlet through
the i~[atala into the Baltic.

RUSSIA.
1265. THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE           exceeds every other in
extent of territory, and forms about one seventh part of
the  whole habitable globe.         It embraces     the half of
Europe, all the north of Asia, and vast territories on the
north-west coast of America.
1266. Asiatic    Russia is much larger in extent than
European Russia, but by far less populous, both            however being less thickly settled than       the  more southern
regions of Asia or America.
1267. The population       consists of four classes, the
nobility, clergy, common people, and peasants, or serfs,
the last class being the property of the crown or of individual nobles: the amounlt of the whole may be stated
at 35 millions.
1268. The Russians were formerly a rude and an ignorant people, but institutions for the purposes of instrtuction are becoming numerous and excellent.
In 1818,the Petersburg Bible Society had 128 branches, and had printed the
Bible in 28 differeit languages.
1269. There were in Russia 3253 manufacturing establishments of various
ktinds in 1825. Great quanltities of brandy are distilled, of which more than
120millions of gallons are consumed in the coLntry. In 1820, there were
mnore than 60 millions of sheep in Russia, and the wool from Odessa, was
considered equal to the best Spanish. Gold and platina, recently found on
the Ural mountains, bid fair to become sources of considerable profit.
1270. The principal productions are wheat, rye, oats, barley, Indian corn,
hemp, &amp;c. The chief exports are hemp, flax, timber, iron, grain, tal!ow, and
leather. The last of these articles is much celebrated. Russia has also
mines of silver and copper.
1271. The commerce of this country, which is very extensive, is carried on
through its adjacent seas. Inland navigation is also extensive, reaching from
the Black and Caspian Seas, to the Baltic and Arctic Ocean.
1272. The Russians are generally a well formed, robust, and couragooum
race of men, with tolerably fair complexions.

are clothed in furs, for nearly six months of the year.
1274. The empire of Russia is governed by a sovereign, who is absolute and
despotic in the fullest sense of those terms.
EUROPEAN RUSSIA.
M3ap of Europe.-How is European Russia bounded? Capital?   Chief
Towns? Principal Rivers?
1275. RUSSIA in Europe, formerly called Muscovy is
mostly a level counatry, and abounds in extensive plains
and majestic rivers.
1276. The southern parts are mild and productive
the remnainder is cold, and in some poritions barren.
1277. In winter, thepeople often amuse themselves by slidilng down hills
which they first make with timbers, aild theni cover them with ice. In
travellinag duLring the winter months, the inhabitants use sleds, andu the more
wealthy,.whenthey wish for better accominmodation, place on these sleds
small houses.
1278. TowNs.1 ST. PETERSBURG, the metropolis of the Russian Empire,
the residence of the imperial famnily, was founlded by Peter the Great,'in 1703.
The small wooden houses of the poor exhibit a striking conitrast to the superb
edifices of the iiobility, standing as they do side by side. The city is regularly built, with broad streets and contains many most magnificent buildings.
1279. Moscow, the ancient capital, and still the place of the Emperors
coronation, situLated on the river Moskwa, firom wliiclh the city derives its
name, and vwhich runas in a winding course through it, is one of the most populous cities in Europe. It has few advantages for commerce, the river on
which it stands beinlg small, and except for rafts, navigable only in the spring.
It was burned to the ground in 1812, by the Russians, who thereby prevenited
Bonaparte fi-om making it a place of winter quarters for his troops. The
conflagration ofthe city was so brilliant and grand as to be aptly described by
Bonaparte, "an ocean of flame." It has since been rebuilt with,greater
splenldor than it formerly exhibited, but is remarkable for the same conitrast in
its edifices as is St. Petersburg.
1280. Cronstadt, the principal naval station of Russia, is a seaport on an
island in the gulf of Finland, 20 miles from St. Petersburg.

and manufactures, and induced a state of luxury and indolence from which
they seem incapable of being aroused.
1371. Spain is thought capable of supporting 50 millions ofpeople. When
under the Romans it is computed to have contained 40 millions, but it now
contains only about one third of that number, 14 millions, and for the subsistence ofthese large importations are annually made.

the residence of the royal family, and the-capital of the nation.
1377. The two most important seaports are Barcelona, nloted for its wines

plaster, ornamented in front by a covering of white marble. Tney are gee--
erally so situated as to have a communication with a canal, by means of a
landing stair, in the water of which almost every family plies a gondola, a
small, light boat. These gondolas are used to carry passenigers from one
part of the city to another, answering the same purpose as our stages and
coaches. They are propelled by two oarsmen, who with a gondola may be
Ihired for one dollar per day.

TURKISI,, OR OTTOMAN EMPIRE.
1431. TURKiEY includes two great divisions, namely,
Turkey in Europe and Turkey in Asia.
1432. Formerly Egypt constituted a part of this empire, and was governedby a viceroy, but he has lately declared himself independent. It included
Greece and the Barbary States, which have also become independent.
1433. The government, which            is perhaps the most
despotic in the world, is sometimes called the Porte or
the Sublime Porte, from        the gate of the palace.
1434. On the Turkish flag, a crescent, or half moon is always painted, intended to show that their power, like the moon when in that state, is increasing.
1435. The Emperor of Turkey is styled the Sultan or Grand Saignor,
and his queen the Sultana. His council is called the Divan. The Elnperor
is also sometimes profanely called, "The Shadow of God," "God on earh,"
and sometimes "Brother to the sun and moon."
1436. The chief officers are the Grand Vizier, or prime minister; the
Mufti, or high priest; the Viziers of the bench, or pachas of three tails, so

called from three horse tails being carried before them when they march in
procession; the Beglen beys are viceroys, and the Pachas are governors of
towns and districts under viceroys. The Secretary of State and High
Chancellor is styled Reis Effendi.
1437. The iTurks are descended from the Tartars, who are an ignorant and
barbarous nation in Asia. Having taken Constantinople, they put an end to
the Eastern or Greek Empire in 1453.
1438. As a nation, the Turks are ignorant and indolent, but honest and
honorable in their dealings, sedate and solemn in their manners, usually hiospitable to strangers, and wihen excited are bold and revengeful.
TURKEY IN EUROPE.
How is Tutrkey in Euorpe bounded? Capital? Chief Towns? Principal Rivers?
1439. TURizEY, in the N., is level, in the S., mountainous, but interspersed with fine aid extensive valleys.
1440. It has a temperate and healthy climate, a fertile soil but miserably cultivated.
1441. The     southern parts    produce    grapes, olives,
oranges, figs, and     an   abundance     of ot.her  deliciolus
f'uits.  The othier principal productions are grain, cotto,) and frice.

1443. TOWNS. CONSTANTINOPLE, anciently called Byzantium, is situated on a strait called the Bosphorus, which is one mile wide and twenty
miles long. The houses, amounting to a prodigious number, are built of
wood, and have in general a mean appearance. No foreigner, not even the
minister of a friendly power, is permitted to reside in the city. It is well
fortified, being surrounded by walls of free stone, flanked by numerous towers, with 20 gates. It has great facilities for commerce, and one of the finest
harbors in the world. Adrianople is a place of considerable trade, and in
population, the second city in European T'urkey.
GREECE.
1444. In the S. of Turkey is Greece, which in former times took the lead of all the nations of the earth
in civilization, science, and the fine arts. Her ancient
poets, orators, and statesmen, are even now            considered the most perfect models, in their several professions,
which the world has ever seen.
1445. Thle modern Greeks are a well formed, brare,
active, and courteous race; but insincere, selfish, and
treacherous, have little education but much genius.
1446. Greece, which was for centuries              subject to
the  Ottoman Empire, has lately become independent.
It has a temperate and healthy climate and a fruitful
soil.
1447. The Greeks, from 1453 to 1821, were subjected to the most degrading bondage imposed on them by the merciless'rurks; since which they
have been engaged in a most unequal and sanguinary struggle for the recovery of their lost liberty.
1448. The contest continued till 1827, when the three powers of England,
France, and Russia decided it, by their interference in the battle of Navarino,
and gave liberty and independence to Greece.
1449. Count Capo d'Istria administered the government as President till
1831, when he was assassinated, and Otho, son of Louis Charles, of Bavaria, was chosen by the Greeks his successor, under the title of" KIing of
Greece." He holds his court at Athens.
1450. Athens, formerly the capital of what was called Attica, once the
seat of learning and the arts, has now dwindled down to a state of comparative insignificance. It is still noted for the temple of Theseus, which,
though built 480 years before Christ, is yet the most perfect edifice of antiquity now remaining in the world.

TURKEY IN ASIA.
-How is Turkej in Asia bounded? What is the capital? Chief Towns?
Prinicipal Rivers?
1459. TURKEY      is the   most interesting     division  of
Asia, from having been the scene of most of the transactions! recorded in the sacred        scriptures.     It includes
the Holy Land, Syria, Asia Minor, and Armenia.
1460e Many     celebrated    cities of antiquity, whose
foundations are Inow     scarcely to be    traced, had their
seat in this country; among which were Nineveh,
Babylon, Troy, Palmnyra, Balbee, Antioch, and Tyre.
i461. Asiatic Turkey is a mild, healthy, fertile, aind
delightful country, with an agreeable variety of hills and
dales, mountains and valleys. From the indolence of
the inhabitants, a great part of the coiintry. is a mere
wilderness.
1462. Its more noted productions are wines, pomegranates, olives, and
other fruits. Its principal articles of manufacture are silks, carpets, and
leather.
1463. Besides Turks, Greeks, and Armenians, there are several wandering
tribes, as Curds, Turcomen, and Arabs. The Armenians are mostly
Christians, and there are Greek Christians scattered over the whole
country.
1464. The Jews formerly inhabited Syria, with Jerusalem for their capital,
but this once beautiful city was razed to the ground, and they themselves
scattered over the face of the earth.
1465. TowNs. CONSrTANTINOPLE is the capital, for a description of
which, see Turkey in Europe.

1466. Aleppo, the capital of Syria, is one of the largest cities in the Ottoman empire. It stands in the centre of a plain, and is six miles in circuit. The streets are narrow, but well paved with large square stones,
presenting a very neat appearance. Its trade consists of silks, camblets,
and leather.
1467. Damascus is beautifully situated in the midst of a large and fertile
plain, about 50 miles from the sea. Its most remarkable buildings are the
caravansaries, which consists of long galleries, supported by marble pillars,
and the mosques and chapels, about 200 in number, which are handsome
edifices. The manufacture of sabres and knives was formerly the most
famous, but those of silk, cotton stuffs, leather, and soap, are now the
principal.
1468. Bagdad is situated on the Tigris, and was once the splendid seat of
the Saracen Califs. Since it fell into the hands of the Turks, it has lost
most of its former splendor and magnificence.
1469. Jerusalem, a famous city of Syria, and anciently the capital of Palestine, or Judea, is situated about 40 miles east of the Mediterranean sea.
The city now contains magnificent chutrches, towers, domes, and other objects of interest, and the miraculous events which formerly occurred here,
render it, perhaps, the most attractive place to visit on the face of the earth.
Among the buildings may be noticed particularly the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre, much visited by the Christian pilgrims, who resort to Jerusalem
from all quarteis of the globe, and the IMosque of Omar, which is frequented
by Mlahomedan pilgri s, occupying the place where the Temple of S(6omon once stood. It is the most splendid pile of architecture in the Turkish
empire.
1470. Palmyra, once a splendid city of Syria, the Tadmor of king Solomon, now consists merely of stupendous ruins in the midst of a sandy desert, bounded on three sides by lofty mountains.

destitute of water.
1472. Arabia comprises three divisions, namely, Arabia Petrea, or the rocky, in the N. W.; Arabia Deserta,
or thle desert, in the middle and N.; and Arabia Felix,
or the happy, in the S.
1473 The' climate, in the low and sandy plains, is excessively hot and
subject to a terrible wind called the Simoon, or Samiel, which often causes
suffocation and instant death. The more elevated parts are pleasant and
salubrious.
1474. The most noted productions of Arabia are coffee, dates, a peculiar kind of gum, called gum Arabic, frankincense, balsam, myrrh, and
aloes.
1475. The most celebrated animals are the horse and camel. The former
is admired for his swiftness and beauty, the latter for his docility and usefulness. The camel seems admirably fitted to supply the wants of the inhabitants of this desolate region. He will travel over parched and sandy deserts
six or eight days without water, carrying at the same time a load of nearlv
1000 pounds weight. In allusion to his ability to carry such immense busdens, he is sometimes called the "ship of the desert." His docility is manifested by his kneeling down to receive his load on his back, and when it is
properly adjusted, he rises at the cominmand of his master, and proceeds oa
his journey
1476. T'he Arabs are of middle stature and brown complexion. They seldon, laugh oi weep, but preserve a grave and melancholy air, which, aided
by their lolg beards, gives them a singularly bold and commanding appearance. They were called Saracens during the middle ages, and then excelled
mIost nations in ]learning and science: but they are now ignorant and barbarous. They subsist principally by plundering, having no permanent local
tion; those on the coast practising piracy, and those in the interior, robbery.
They live, however, amicably in tribes, in patriarchal simplicity, being exceedingly hospitable to those who confide in their friendship and honor
treating with great kindness their slaves and dependants, and are free from
the vices of drunkenness and gaming.
1477. TOWNS. MECCA is situated in a narrow and sandy valley, about
40 miles from the Red Sea. It is celebrated for being the birth place of the
famous imposter, Mahomet, which causes it to be much resorted to by pilgrims from every part of the Mahomedan world.
1478. Medina, about 180 miles from Mecca, is famous for containing the
tomb of Mahomet, who died A. D. 637. Medina is called the city ofthe
Prophet, on account of the protection it afforded him in his flight from
Mecca, called the Ilegira, or flight of Mahomet, which happened A. D. 622.
1479. Mocha, near the Strait of Babelmandel, is famous for its coffee.

1480. PERSIA formerly comprised a large extent of
country, and was successively the seat of several poworful kingdoms and empires, but it is at present much
reduced, both it, respect to its size and political importance.
1481. The surface is uneven, in some parts rising
into barren mountains. and in other parts consisting of
vast, sandvy plains, abounding in lakes and marshes.
There are but few trees or rivers, and but little fertile
land on the plains and ii the valleys.

1482. The climate in the south is hot, but cold in the
northern and more elevated regions.
1483. The chief exports and productions are corn, rice, tobacco, silk, coton, carpets, pearls, fruits, wines, and several kinds of drugs.
1484. T''he Persians are the most learned people of the east, and are, in
general, gay, polite, deceitful and cruel, profuse in flattery, and fond of dress
and show.
1485. TowNs. TEH-ERAN, about 60 miles S. of the Caspian Sea, has a
low situation and mean appearance, with nothing to recommend it to notice
except the royal palace.
1486. Ispahan, the former capital, was once the largest and most splendid
of the oriental cities, and is supposed by some to have contained one million
of inhabitants. It is still the first city in Persia in commerce and manufactures, and is the centre of trade for the interior of the country.

climate.
1488. It comprehends countries that have successively passed under different names, and its present inhabitants are made up of Hindoos, Afghans,
Parsees, Tartars/and Beloochees.

1491. BELOOCHISTAN       which once     formed a part of
Persia, has been but little explored by Europeans, and
little is known respecting it.    From    the  best accouLnts
we have, it mnay be described as a mountainous and
generally barren country.
- 1492. Beloochistan is inhabited by different classes of people, the one
called Belooches, live by plundering and robbery; the other, Brahoees, occupy the more elevated parts, and subsist chiefly on their flocks and herds.
They are a mild peaceable, and industrious people. The chief town is
Kelat.

1493. HINDOSTAN, or Indostan, which is also called
India within the Ganges, is considered the richest and
most beautiful country of Asia, and if we except Chinia,
the most populous.
1 494. It is mountainous in the N., and there is a range of mountains
towards the S., but except in the N., it is for the most Ipart level, or moderately uneven, abounding in rivers and excelling in fertility of soil, most

salubrious, but in     the middle and       southern parts, sultry; and rain is constant for three months in the year.
1496. Milk, rice and other vegetables are the chief articles of food, especially rice, which is very extensively cultivated. The other principal productions are cotton, wheat, sugar, indigo, salt-petre, opium, tobacco, millet, silk, and various fruits.
1497. The mines of Golconda             were    once    exceedingly rich in diamonds, but-they are now far less valuble.
1498. The Banian, or Indian fig-tree, is a great curiosity. The branches
extend to the earth and strike down roots which form new stems or trunks,
so that each tree does in fact form a complete grove. One of these trees on
an island in the Nerbuddah river, near Baroach, has 3000 trunks or stems,
many of them quite large, and the whole affording room for 7000 persons to
repose under its shade.
1499. The country on the banks of the Ganges, including Bengal, Bahar,
and Benares, with Calcutta for their capital, belong to the English; besides
several places on the Coromandel Coast, the capital of which is Madras;
also the island of Bombay, Surat, and several tracts on the Malabar
coast.
1500. The island of Ceylon too, belongs to the English. It has a feltile
soil, a temperate and healthy climate, and is particularly noted for the production of Cinnamon, and for its pearl fisheries. Its other more important
productions are ginger, pepper, sugar, cotton, precious stones, and gems.

Christians scattered among them.
1502. Their religion and customs are so fixed as to seem almost unalterable, having undergone little or no change since India was first known.
1503. They differ strikingly from every other nation in being divided into
tribes or castes, the four principal of which are the Bramins or priests, the
soldiers, the agriculturalists or merchants, and soudas or laborers. These
different castes are forbidden to intermarry, to eat with each other, and even
to drink from the same vessel.
1504. The general character of the Hindoos is a compound of indolence,
superstition and cruelty, the last of which traits of character, they keep in
active exercise towards their dependents and iisferiors.
1505. Their religion is of a most degrading kind. Ablution in the Ganges
and pilgrimages they consider religious duties. Trifling as these ceremonies
may seem, they constitute far the better parts of their religion. Its spirit
leads them to inflict the most horrible wounds on themselves, by way of expiation for their sins, and even prompts widows to burnl themselves on the
funeral pile of their husbands. This last abominable practice was abolished
by the interposition of the English government in 1830, throughout their dominions in India, though it is yet in use in some portions ofthe country.
1506. Towns. CALCUTTA the emporium of Bengal, and the seat of government of British India, is situated on the Hoogly, an arm of the Ganges,
about 100 miles fiom the sea. Its commerce is extensive, and in splendor it
is not excelled by any city in Asia. Merchanlts from all countries reside
here, and the mixture of Asiatic and European manners which one beholds,
gives to the busy throng in the streets a very singular and grotesque appearance.

15309. This vast country, of which we know           but little
except its coast, has      been   called   by various     names,
as the Peninsula beyond the Ganges,, India beyond the
Ganges, the      Farther    Peninsula, Farther India, and
C(lini-India.
1510. C(hin-India     comprises      the  Birman     Empire,
thie kingdom     of Tonquin', Cochin        China, Camnbodia,
Laos, and Siam, and the Peninsula           of Malaya or Malacca.
1511. This country is less cultivated and less populous than Hindostan,
a%d the surface, from the best accounts we have, consists of ridges of moun,
tailns, running parallel with each other from N. to S., with spacious and fertile valleys intervening, which produce wheat, rice, cotton, toqbacco, sugarilhdigo, various kinds of spices, gums, and tropical fruits.

cious stones. The more remarkable animals are theelephant, rhinoceros,
tiger, leopard, and orang-outang.
1513. In the low     country    the climate is humid, and
subject to excessive heat, but in the more           elevated regions, it is temperate and healthy.
1514. The Birinan Empire comprises Ava, Pega, Cassay, and formerly Ar
racan, the last of which, besides several other places or provinces of this
country, now belolng to the English.
1515. The Birmans are lively and passionate, fond of music and poetry, and
have great sldkill in the art of gilding. The Mlalays are a bold, ferocious, and
revengefuf race, much given to piracy. In general, all the inhabitants of
Farther India resemble the Hindoos less than the Chilnese, and in the arts of
civilized life, are less advanced than either.
1516. TowNs. UMMERAPOORA is situated near the Irawaddy, on a small
lake about 400 miles from the mouth of the river. It has some buildings of
brick, but what contributes greatly to its splendor is the gildiiLng of its religious edifices, which gives them the appearance of temples of gold. It was
founded in 1783, and in 1800. only seventeen years after, it contained
175,000 inhabitants.. In 1810 nowever, its population was reduced to nearly
one half that number.
1517. Rangoon, on the Irawaddy, 30 milesafrom its mouth, is the principal
port.

CHINA PROPER.
How is China bounded? Capital? Chief Towns? Principal Rive rs?
1519. CHINA     lies in the  south-east part of the    empire, extending from    the  Great Wall on      the north, to
the Gulf of Tonquin on the south.
1520. China contains 4402 walled cities, and is supposed by some to contain 333 millions of inhabitants,
at least 2 millions of which live constantly on the water.
By others the population is estimated at about one
half that number.
1521. China    enjoys   from   its situation  a  mild   and
healthy climate, with an exceedingly fertile soil, which
is under so   high  a  state  of cultivation that even     the
rocks and mountains are       made to    yield the usual products of the earth.
1522. This country has a diversified surface of mountains and valleys, and
abounds in productions of various kinds, the principal of which are the tea
plant, rice, anld silk.
1523. Tea is obtained from the leaf of a shrub or plant that grows six or
seven feet high. It is branching and an evergreen. The leaves are carefully plucked, and dried in cast-iron pans on stoves, they are then rolled in
form by hand before they are offered for sale.

GATHERING TEA.
1524. This article of.luxury, which was scarcely known in Europe till
tfihe middle of the 17th century, has come into such general use that 50,000
tons of shipping are annually employed in its transportation from China.
Still so vast is the home consumption, that were exportation to cease, the
price in China would not be much diminished.
1525. There are two kinds of teas, namely, black and green, the latter of
which is much superiog in quality to the former. The black teas, beginning
with the poorer qualities, are bohea, congo, campo, souchong, pouchong,
and pekoe. The green teas are twankey, hyson sldkin, young hyson, hyson,
imnperial, and gunpowder.
1526. The Great Wall of China and the Imperial
Canal are monuments of immense labor, and are great
curiosities.
1527. The Chinese Wall traverses high mountains, deep valleys, and by
means of arches, wide rivers, for a distance, in the whole length, of about
1500 miles. It is about 30 feet high, 15 feet broad, or wide enough for six
horsemen to ride abreast. In some places it is double and treble to protect
exposed passages. At equal distances of about one hundred paces, are
towers mounted with cannon. Its foundation and corners are granite, but
the principal part is of blue brick, cemented with pure white mortar.  
1528. This wall is the most stupendous work on the globe, anld is said to
have been built about 2000 years ago, to prevent the incursions of the Mogul
Tartars.
1529. The Imperial Canal is one of the most splendid achievements of
the kind ever undertaken by man. It forms a water communication, with

the exception of one day's journey, between Pekin and Canton, and is about
1400 miles long. This canal, in connexion with the numerous streams in
China, has rendered the country highly celebrated for its iiland navigation.
1530. It is remarkable that some of the most extensive canals have beenl
in use about 2000 yealrs. In the year 605, it is said there were in the empire
almost 5000 miles of canal.
1531. The Chinese claim to be by far the oldest nation on the earth, make
vain pretensions to learning, and profess an acquaintance with all Europeanimprovements.
1532. The Chinese make no division of time into weeks, and consequently have no sabbath. They have temples and pagodas, a kind of churches,
and numerous priests, called bronzes.
1533. The inhabitants possess, in general, the usual
virtues and vices of a slavish, industrious, and commercial people, except that they are seldom guilty of
the sin of intoxication, as they rarely use strong liquors.
1534. The womnen of this country are sold in marriage, and held in the
most degrading bondage. It is not uncommon for a peasant to be seen
hdlding his plough, and driving his team which is composed of his wife and
an ass yoked together.
1535. A Chinese lady, to be considered beautiful, must have small eyes,
protruding lips, strait black hair, and feet so small that she can scarcely wall.
The last is regarded of the most importance, and the effect is produced by
putting small shoes on the feet of children and never changing them till the
feet have done growing. Among the men, corpulence is deemed respectable,
as it is thought to indicate an easy life.
1536. TowNS. PEKING or PE.KIN is situated in a very fertile valley, about
60 miles from the Great Wall. Pekin, which signifies the Northern Court,
was so called to distinguish it from Nankin, the southern court, where the
emperor formerly resided. The city is about 18 miles in circumference, and
has two parts, one occupied by Tartars, the other by Chinese. Each ofthese
parts is surrounded by a wall; that of the Tartars is very lofty, and so thick
that twelve horsemen can ride abreast on its top. The houses are low, being
principally of one story, with no superfluous rooms, and generally surrounded by a wall six or seven feet high. Within this enclosure, a whole family of
three generations, with their respective wives and children, will often be
found. Pekin has numerous churches and temples, and about 10,000 palaces.
The principal streets are about 7 rods wide, and 3 miles long, thickly bordered with rich shops. It is astonishing to see the immense concourse of people
which continually fills them, and the confusion caused by the prodigious
number of horses, camels, mules, and carriages, which are meeting and passing each other. And what is still more remarkable, not a single woman
among all this vast collection is ever to be seen.
A more minute description of this city is given on account of its being
often considered the most populous in the world, though Jedo is by some
ranked in the same class.

AFRICA.
1606.   Africa, mentioned      in  history  thousands     of
years ago, is still to us what it was to the ancients-the
land of mystery.      Although its coasts lie     in  sight of
the most civilized countries, yet we know nothing more
than its outlines: into the interior the foot of a European has lately, for the first time, penetrated.
1607. In Africa there are but few          large and navigable rirvers, or good harbors, no large gulfs or inland
seas penetrating its interior, which have contributed to
prevent it from being explored. Other causes are its
boundless deserts, its hot and unhealthy climate, and the
savage anid forbidding manners of its inhabitants.
1608. TI e northern parts of Africa were famous in the earliest ages of
history. Ethiopia was a celebrated country; Egypt was reckoned the cradle
of commerce, the arts and sciences, and Carthage was for a long time the
formidable rival of Rome. Africa is now the least known, the least civilized,
andthe least important, of the five Grand Divisions of the globe.
1609. It ranks in size as the second Grand Division,
being about 4500 miles long, and 4000 miles wide,.containinrg 1 1 millions of square miles, and from        100   to
110 millions of inhabitants.
AFRICA. Q. What knowledge have we of Atiica  1606. What has prevented
this country from beinrg explored? 1607.
Q. Whichl parts of Afiica were faenous in the earliest ages, and for what? 1608.

LION, ZEBRA, CAMELEOPARD, HIPPOPOTAMUS, IYENA, AND OSTRICH.
1610. The interior of the country must be very populous, since within two
centuries and a half, it has contributed 40 millions of vigorous men to the
slave trade, and is yet any thing but depopulated. Formerly 105 thousand
slaves were annually introduced into the West Indies, besides vast numbers
into other parts of the world' Even since most of the European aild American nations have agreed to abolish this traffic, fiom 50 to 200 thousand
negroes are yearly torn friom this wretched country and sold as slaves.
1611. Africa can enumerate five times as many species of quadrupeds as
Asia, and three times as many as all America. It excels Asia in the size of
its colossal river-horse, the hippopotamus, its giraffe, antelopes, and apes.
Here only the lion, king of beasts, and the ostrich, king of birds, attain to
their fill perfection. The other large and noted animals are the elephant,
cameleopard. camel, zebra, buffalo, crocodile, and boa-conlstrictor.
1612. T'I'he boa-constrictor is a wonderful animal. The largest are about
80 feet long, and so strong and swift that nothing can escape being caught
(lad destroyed by them.
1613. This animal oftentimes watches for his prey by clinging its tail round
a high branch of a tree, where some quadruped would be liklely to pass for
food or water, and there swings about in the air like a branch or pendant of
the tree, until his prey approaches; then suddenly relinquishing its position,
swift as lightning it seizes its victim, and coiling itself around its throat and
chest, crushes it to death. The animals which are easily taken by it are
deer, dogs, bullocks, and even horses with their riders, both expiring together
in the sanme fatal fold of the serpent.
1614. In Affica, as in America, the torrid zone produces plants and fruits the most nutricious, the most
refreshing, and the most wholesome.'1615. The chief vegetables for sustenance are wheat, barley, millet, rice,
yamns, lotus-berries, gum senegal, dates, figs, sugar cane, and various spices.

climate? 1616.AFRICA.                             249
The best of butter is procured from the shih or butter tree. Coffee, palm, wine,
cape wine, and the milk of cocoa-nuts are used for drink, and cotton, hemp,
and flax, for clothing. The waist of salt is generally and most severely felt,
as well as the want of water in many places.
1616. The     chief articles of export are       slaves, gold
and ivory.     The climate is various, but inll general the
hottest on the globe.
1617. In the atmosphere of the tropics, except in mountainous or insular
situations, the heat of the sun is terrible, and Anderson tells of eggs being
roasted by it in the sands of Guinea, and the naked feet of the negroes being
blistered. On the coast, the heat is mitigated by breezes from the sea, from
the mountains, and by the incessant rains; but the air is nevertheless more
impure and unhlealtlhy than the interior, which has a higher elevation.
1618. The soil of those places which are well watered is exceedingly pro-'ductive, repaying the husbandman for his labor one hundred fold.
1619. Among the most remarkable natural features of Africa are its
boundless and barren deserts, of which the Sahara or Great Desert is the
most celebrated.
1620. The surface of these deserts is oftentimes so agitated by the wind as
to produce immense clouds of sand, which resemble at a distance a storm at
sea, but are much more terrible and disastrous. Over this wide waste, no
human being could ever travel were it not for the oases which are interspersed like so many fertile islands in the dreary ocean. These-furnish resting
places and water for the caravans, but if the water is dried up, as is sometimes the case, they perish with thirst. From this cause there perished in
1805 a caravan of 2000 men and 1800 camels.
A STORM IN THE DESERT.
1621. The population of Africa is collposed of various tribes, mostly in a
barbarous state, being chiefly Moors and Negroes. The former are Mohamedans, and occupy the parts north of the Mountains of the Moon, and the
latter are Pagans, and cccupy the remaining parts.

merely a Turkish viceroyalty, scarcely a fifth part
inhabited, and distinguished only for the ruins of its
former magnificence; as pyramids, obelisks, catacombs, &amp;c.
1623. The viceroy has recently declared himself independent of Turkey, anld as yet maintains his independenlce though it has not been acknowledged by the
Porte.
1624. This country is divided ilnto two parts, Upper
and Lower Egypt, the former lies S. of Cairo, and the
latter between Cairo and the Mediterranean.
1625. The soil is generally barren, and the country
mountainous, except a strip or belt on each side of:the
Nile, which, owing to the annual inundations of that
river, is exceedingly productive.
PYRAMIDS, SPHYNX, CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE, AND A CARAVAN ENCAMPINC.
1626. The rise of the Nile, which is the only river of note in Egypt, is
caused by the periodical rains near its source, which rains are common in
tropical regions. The Nile begins to rise about the 15th of June, and subsides about the last of AuLgust. When at its greatest height, it is, in appearance, almnost as broad as a sea, and fertilizes a vast extent of country.
1627. It seldom rains in Egypt, even a few drops is a rare occurrence;
but owing to the heavy dews, canals, and flooqds of the Nile, vegetation
scarcely ever suffers for want of moisture.
The summers are hot and unhealthy, the country being suLbject to terrible

ravages from the plague; the winters are temperate anld healthy. Some of
the principal productions are rice, wheat, maize, barley, sugar-cane, cotton,
flax and indigo.
The inrhabitants are Copts, Arabs, and Turks. The Arabs are the most
numerous, but the Tlurks are the ruling people or tribe.
1628. The Egyptian has, generally, a strong, active frame, tawny complexion, gay disposition, and lnot deficient in mental abilities. He is temperate and religious, but superstitious.
1629. The Pyramids of Egypt are supposed to have been erected about
900 years before Christ, and though the object for which they were designed
is not certainly known, they were probably the sepulchral monuments of
the Egyptian kings. Among the most renowned, are those of Cecrops and
Cephrenes. The former, Herodotus says, contains the bones of Cecropg,
and the latter, which is near by, those of Cephrenes, his brother and successor. The account of this ancient wonder is not improbable, which says
that 100,000 then worked 20 years, without interruption, in building the enormous pyramid of Cecrops, and that it was 800 feet, or about one quarter of a
miile high. Late writers say that it was about 500 feet high, and covered
nearly 11 acres of land.
1630. TowNs. CAIRO, or GRAND CAIRO, is thle capital of modern
Egypt, and is the most superb and commercial city of Africa.
1631. Alexandria, which was once so celebrated as the seat of learning,
commerce, and the arts, was built by Alexander the Great, 331 years before
Christ. It is now greatly reduced, and is little remarkabke except for the
ruins of its former splendor. Among them may be mentioned Pompey's
Pillar, Cleopatra's Nr-dle, and the Catacombs.
1632. The Alexandrian Library, which was founded by Ptolemy Philadelphus, 284 years before Christ, and burnt by the Saracens, A. D. 640, was the
largest and most valuable one of antiquity, and attracted scholars from all
countries.

BARBARY STATES.
1633. Barbary was anciently known             by the names
of Mauritania, Numidia, Africa Proper, and Lvbia, and
has successiveily become the seat of large and powerful
kingdoms or states.        Among     them   maybe mentioned
Carthage, not a vestige of whose former greatness is
now to be seen.
Q. What is the Egyptian character? 1628. Describe the Pyramids. 1629MOROCCO.;&amp;5
1634. Barbary is now composed of several small
states, noted only for their barbarism        and piracy.
1635. The climate is temperate, pleasant, and generally healthy; and the
soil N. of the Atlas mountains, is distinguished for its fertility. At some
seasons, the country is subject to the plague, which makes fearful ravages
among the people.
1636. Its prinlcipal productions and exports are oil, wine, sugar, cottont,
ivory, ostrich-feathers, Morocco leatler, fruit, particularly dates, and most
killds of grain.
1637. Tihe region below the Atlas mountains, as far S. as the desert, produces almost exclusively dates, on which account it has been called Biledalgerid, or the land of dates.
1638. The Barbary States are continually infested with ferocious animals,
of which the lion and panther are the most noted and formidable, unless we
except the Boa, or serpent of the desert, which, among all the numerous animals of the kind in Africa, is the strongest, swiftest and most venomous.
1639. Here also are numberless insects, among which is the locust, that
often appears in such swarms, as to sweep from the face of the earth, all
traces of vegetation, leaving nothing but a barren waste behind them.
1640. The inhabitants consist of four classes; 1st, Moors, the ruling people, and the most numerous; 2dly, Jews, who live in the cities and control
the trade; 3dly, Arabs, who generally lead a wandering life; 4thly, Berbers
or Brebers, the supposed descendants of the original inhabitants, and from
whom the country is said to be named. TI'his class occupies the mountainous parts.
1641. The general character of the inhabitants is a compound of ignorance, superstition, and cruelty; and piracy was formerly a common employment.

valley, upwards of 100 miles from the sea. It once contained about 700,000
inhabitauts, but by wars, pestilence, and famine, the number is reduced at
present nearly one half. It contains many splendid temples and mosques,
and is the ugual residence of the Emperor.
1645. Fez, the aucient capital of the kingdom of the same name, and noted
as the seat of the learned institutions of the Mlahommedals, is still a sp] endid
city, and the largest in the empire.

strength, and the piratical disposition of its people.          It
is noted for its coral fishery on the coast.
1647. TowNS. ALGIERS, the capital of the country, is a strongly fortified city, built on the side of a hill next the harbor. The houses rising one
above another, are of resplendent whiteness, and make a most magnificent
appearance from the Mediterranean. It wvas taken by the French in 1830, in
whose possession it still remains.

NUBIA.
1656. Nubia is an extensive         country, and     divided
into several petty    states or kingdoms, of wvhich         Sennaar and    Dongola    are the   best known to Europeans.
This counatry    abounds in     the magunificent ruins of antiquity.
1657. The Nile intersects this       country, the banks of
whlich river are rich and productive, but the remaining
portions are    sandy, barren,      and   destitute  ol' water.
The climate, though hot, is dIry and generally healthy.
1658. A hot and noxious wind from the desert, called the Simoon or Samiel often prevails here, which, as its name indicates, is poisonous. Its approach is preceded by a dark yellow appearance in the eastern horizon, a
thick sulphurous exhalation, rising from the ground and cove;ihg the whole
heavenls, and by a hissing anld crackling noise. The windcl, if inhaled, produces instant death. Even the camels of the caravans seemn instinctively to
avoid breathing it by thrusting their noses into the sand, and holding them
there till it has blown by, whichl it usually does in a few momenlts. Men
avoid its effects by lying with their faces on the ground, while the danger
continues.
1659. The chief articles of trade are gold, ivory, and slaves.
1660. The Nubians are mostly of Arabian descent, and chiefly il[ahommedans. They are perfectly black, with thick lips, bt, have not the flat nose
and prominenlt jaws of the negro race. They are robust and temperate, but
indolent and treacherous.

exceedingly rich and productive.
1662. This country abounds in anlimals and minerals, and among its chief
vegetable productions are wheat, balsam, myrrh, &amp;c. besides a small grain
called Teff, and the papyrus, of which the ancients made a sort of paper.

CENTRAL AFRICA.
1697 Central Africa is for the most part wholly
unknown to us, though mnany efforts have been            made,
and rnany valuable lives lost, in attemptlng to explore it.
1698. The country is naturally divided by the Mountains of the Moon into
Soudon or Nigritia and Ethiopia. Soudan is in the N. and Ethiopa in the
S. and the latter is wholly unknown to us.
SOUDAN OR NIGRITIA.
1699. This region comprises numerous countries and
kingdoms, which are considered         fertile, and  many     of
them populous, thoughl they are generally but little
known, and some of them       scarcely at all.

knowledge, are Bambarra, Yaoor, Timnbuctoo, Houssa,'
Bornou,    Begharmi, Bergoo, Darfour, Asben, Kong, and
Fezzan.
1701. The exports are principally slaves, gold, ivory, ostrich feathers and
civet, which are carried to Cairo anid the Barbary States, by caravans through
the Great Desert.
1702. TOMBUCTOO or TIMBnUCTOO, is the capital of a small kingdom of
the same name, and the commercial capital of all Central Africa, being the
resort of caravans from Etrope, Nubia, the Barbary States anld Abyssinia.
This city is generally supposed to be situated somewhere within a few miles
of the Niger; but its exact location has not yet been determined, no modern
traveller. if we except M. Caillie, an enterprising Frenlchman, having peinetrated to it and returned.
1703. The first European traveller that reached Timbuctoo was Major
Laing in 1826, but was barbarously murdered in the desert on his return
homewvards. M. Caillie was more fortunate. He visited it in 1828, and
though full credit has never been given to the details of his narative, still it
must be admrritted that he visited the city.
1704. He describes Timbuctoo as "a mass of ill looking houses, built of
earth, and situated in the midst of an immense plain of yellowish white sand,
where not even the warbling of a bird could be heard, and not a single tree
or shrub could be seenl over three or four feet high." Its population, in his
opinion, "is at the most no more than 10,000 or 12,000; all enlgaged in
trade."
1705. The principal river of Soutdan is the Niger, which is celebrated for
the uncertainty and mystery which, for a long time prevailed, in respect to
its source, course and termination.
1706. Mlany fruitless attempts were made to determine these particulars,
and most of those who were engaged in the enterprise, perished. The
honor of satisfying public curiosity, was at length acquiredby the celebrated
Mtungo Park. He was a Scotchman by birth, and having gained a high
reputation for his discretion and courage as a traveller, he was employed by
the African Association in London, to make discoveries in the interior of
Africa. He ascertained that the Niger had its source in the western part of
that country, between 10' and 12~ N. lat., near the source ofthe Senegal, and
after running an easterly course for several hundred miles, takes a course
south. Park lost his life in Africa, and the termination of the Niger remained
for a long time unknown, and those who attempted to discover it, perished.
1707. At last, two young men, Richard Lander, the attendant of Park in
his last expedition, and his brother John, both Englishmen, succeeded in tracing the course of this river to its mnouth in the Gulf of Guinea. The mouth
by which they reached the sea, is generally laid down o4 maps as the river
Nun. Thus from Park's first point in 1805, its course is traced for 2000
miles, a considerable part of which is navigable for steam-boats, through a
rich and populous country, the inhabitants of which have made considerable
capital? 1702. What is said of its situation? 1702. What of European adventurers? 1703. What description does M. Caillie give of it 1704.

* Little progress has as yet been made upon the Ohio and Erie, besides surveying
the route. The Chesapeak and Ohio has been completed to Williaminsport, Md. 110
mniles. The Miami has been made navigable to Dayton, 67 miles from Cincinnati.
The oldest canal in this country is the Middlesex, constructed in 1808. Many years
intervened before aiiy other was undertaken. The example of New York, in the
gigantic enterprise of connecting the waters of the great lakes with the ocean, gave
an impetus to the spirit of internal improvement, which has since been displayed,
more or less in every state in the Union, and within the last 15 years more than 3000
miles of canals have been constructed, and no country on the globe exhibits at present
so extensive a system of intemal navigation, artificial and natural, as the United
States.

8 9SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.,
PART FIRST is intended for young beginners: PART SECOND for older
puPils: PART THIRD for those considerably advanced in the study.
The book contains some pictures or small maps, with questions referring
to them; these the young learner shlould be made to understand thoroughly,
before he takes the Atlas.
The questions on the Atlas in the First Part may be recited, at first, with
the Atlas before the learner; after which, and before he begins Part Second,
let him review Part First, and make it so familiar that he can recite it without the map. Those who commence with Part Second should do the same.
It is a good practice, and one which is recommended by many experienced
Teachers, to require the learner, as he progresses, to review his former lesson; or, at least, to have some fixed day of every week on which to review
the lessons of the previous week. And if the young learner should do both,
he would be the gainer by the practice, not only in Geography, but iin every
other department of learning.
The celebrated Jacotot, of the Productive School, went still farther: " he would
have scholars repeat often, not merely the lesson of the preceding day, or even
week, but of every thing previously committed to memory. Nothing is omitted;"
adding, "were it not for constant repetition we might even forget our own names,
as we frequently do those of strangers;" and in fact, we oftell do forget our own
ages from this very cause.
V:O Aware of the perplexity incident to frequent changes in the same
book, the author was reluctant to alter any portion of his work: but on a
careful examination of each part, several alterations occurred which would,
it was thought, render the work, as a whole, more SIMPLE, COMPREHENSIVE,
and SYSTEMATIC. The work is now to take a uniform and permanent character.

line round the earth.
Q. What is this line called?
386. The Equator o     Equinoctial line.
02INTRODUCTORY COURSE.
Q. Why has it this name?
387. Because when the sun is directly over the equator the days and, nights are equal all round the globe.
Q. What causes the sun at any time to be exactly over the equator?
388. The annual revolution of the earth.
Q. If the Equator divides the earth's surface into two equal parts, what
must be its relative distance from each pole?
389. It nmust be equally distant.
Q. What then is the Equator?
390. It is an imaginary great circle passing roIund
the earth, at an equal distance fromn each pole.
Q. What is the distance from the equator, on either side of it, towards tlhe
poles called?
391. Latitude, which means width.
Q. Why has it this niame?
39?. Because the     earth  was formerly considered
longest from E. to W.; the distance friomn the Equator
reckoned N. and S. would therefore express its width.

63INTRODUCJTOR r COURSEo
Q. Why are they not called large circles as wvell as the Equator?
3.99. Because the largest is less than that, and they
dii-nish in size towards each pole, where theuy becot        e
nothing.
Q. Hlow then must small circles divide the earth?
400. Into unequal parts.
Q. What are these circles or lines intended from their situation to represent?
401. Circles partallel to the Equator and to one another.
Q. But they do not seem parallel on the map; why is that?
402. Because we cannot represenit accurately a round
body on a plane or flat surface.

represent?
407. Degrees of latitude.
Q. How then is latitude expressed on maps?
408. By the figures on the margin.
Q. How can you tell which latitude is meant, that is, whether N. or S.?
409. If the figures increase up, the latitude is N., if
they increase down, the latitude is S.
Q. How does latitude appear to be reckonled?

Q. What then may the noon-marks, which are often made in houses,
properly be called?
424. Meridian lines.
Q. In what direction should these always be made to run?
425. Exactly North and South.
Q. How many meridians can there be?
426. As many at least as there are places.
Q. How do these lines cut the Equator?
427. At right angles.
Q. What is a right angle? 353.
Q. What do meridians now appear to be?
428. Meridians are great circles which pass throuLgh
each pole, entirely round the earth, crossing the Equator at right anlgles.
Q. What meridianls do Geographers usually take from which to reckon
distances?
429. That which runs through the metropolis or
capital of their own country.
Q. In that case, from what meridian should we reckon?
430. The meridian of Washington.
Q. Where do we geneially commence?
431. At the meridian of Greenwich, a village near
London in England, from     which meridian the English
always reckon.
Q. Whiat are distances on either side of the first, or principal meridian,
reckoned E. or W. called?
432. Longitude.
Q. Why are they so called?
433. The word longitude signifies length, and xwas
used for this purpose, because formerly the earth was
supposed to be longest from E. to W.ITNTRODUC CTORY COJURSSE.

Q. How was it formerly supposed that thie earth was shaped?
434. It was believed to be iat like a board, and to
float on the water.
Q. What are we to understand by longitude?
435. Longitude is distance reckonaed in degrees E.
or W. from     any meridian.
Q. In what longitade are all places E. of the principal or given meridian?
436. In east longitude.
Q. In what longitude are all places W. of the principal or given meridian?
437. In west longitude.
Q. Point to the meridian which passes through Greenwich near London. [Greenwich is not down on the map, but if you take the meridian
which passes through London it will answer the purpose.] In what longitude are all places under this meridian?
438. They have no longitude, because we begin to
reckon from it-fbor the same reason that places which
lie under the Equator have no latitude.
Q. In what longitude is Asia?
439. In east longitude.
Q. Why is it said to be in east longitude?
440. Because it is east of' the meridiani of London or
Greenwich.
Q. In what longitude is New Holland? Why?
Q. In what longitude is the continent of America?
441. In west longitude.
Q. Why is it in west longitude?
442. Because it is west of the meridian of London,
Q. In what longitude are the United States? Indian Ocean? South
America?
Q. Learners sometimes speak of east latitude and north latitude; is this
correct, and if not; why?
443. It is not, because latitude is always reckoned
either north or south, and longitude either east or west.
Q. How do great circles divide the earth? 419. How many degrees in
every circle? 403. How many in half a circle? Ans. 180 degrees.
Q. How many degrees of longitude then are there, and why?
444. One hundred and eighty; because as each meridian divides the earth into halves, one half can         contain only 18Oo of E. and 180o of W. longitude.          These
added together make the 360o which every circle contains.
Q. Why are there not as many degrees of latitude as longitutde?
445. Because longitude     is reckoned   half round the68              INTRODUCTORY    COURSE.
earth, and latitude is reckoned only from       the equator
to each pole, just onle quarter round the earth.
Q. How are the degrees of longitude expressed on maps?
446. On the map of the world they      are expressed
by figures on the equator, but on other maps the figures
are at the top and bottom.
Q. How do you ascertaini whether east or west longitude is meant?
447. If the figures increase towards the E. the longitude is east; if towards the W. the longitude is west.
Q. What meridian runs near the Cape of Good Hope?
448. The meridian of 200 east longitude.
Q. What meridian crosses a part of Madagascar'? What one near Cape
Horn?
Q. How can you determine accurately thle longitude of' any place?
449. By counting the degrees from       one meridian to
another on the map, in the same way that we count the
degrees from one parallel to another, to find out the
latitude.
Q. In what long(itude is Boston? Washington? Paris?
Q. Between what two meridians is Europe?
450. Between 100 west and 60o east longitude.
Q. In what longitude is Africa? Asia? North America? South America?
Q. Why are the meridians not parallel?
451. Because they approach nearer and nearer each
other towards the poles, where they all meet.
Q. Are the degrees of longitude equal in all places?
452. No; they become less and less towards each
pole, where they are nothing.
Q. Why are the degrees of latitude every where nearly equal?
453. Because latitude is reckoned on parallel lines.

side of it, is a dotted line. Will you point to
each? What do these lines form?
454. Small circles round     the
earth.
Q. What are they called?

six in the evening.
Q. What then must be the length of day and night there?
544. Twelve hours each, during the whole year.
Q. When the sun is eithler N. or S. of the Equator, say 23,~ over what
parts does it shine?
545. Over one half as before, but in order to do
this, it mnust shine 23-~ over or beyond one pole, leaving an equal portion at the other pole in darkness,INTRODUCTORY COUIRSE.
Q. How can you account for this?
546. Because as the earth is round, the sunl must
always shine on that half of the surface, that lies next
to it.
Q. When then the sun is N. of the Equator, what effect will it have on
day and night in the nlorthern hemisphere?
547. There will be       more sunshiue than darkness,
and accordingly longer days than nights.
Q. What effect will, at the same time, be produced in the southern hemisphere?
548. There will be more darkness than sunshine and
of course longer nights than days.
Q. What. will be the proportionate lenlgth of day and night?
549. The longer will be more than twelve hours in.
duration, and the shorter, less.
Q. When the sun is 232 N. of the Equator, and it is day on one side of
the earth, what places on the opposite side will, at the same time, have night?
550. All places except those within 23?L of that pole;
these places will have day, because the sun, in illuminating one half of the earth's surface, shines over on
to them.
Q. But is there no night at that pole over which the sun shines as above
desc ibed?
551. None, while the sun is on thie same side of the
equator with thlat pole.      And of course there can be
no day at the other pole, but coiistant night, for tho
same length of tile.
Q. How long is the sun in going firom the'equator to either tropic, and
returninlg to the equator again?
552. Six months.
Q. What then mu.st be the lenlgth of days and nlights at the poles?
553. Six -morths of continual day, and six months
of continual night; that is, one day and onie night in
the whole year.
Q. What now appears to be the cause of our long nights and short days
in winter?
554. The sun is then S. of the eaquator, and consequently shines more on the southern hemisphere than
on the northern, in Which we live.
Q. How may the length of a day or night, in any place, be known?
555. By its distance fi'lom    the equatlor; the greater
the distance the longer will be the day or night.
Q. Where are the longest days one month in length?
556. In about 670o N. or S. latitude.
7778               INTRODUCTORY       COURSE.

641. Though the earth is so large that its roundness cannot be perceived
by the eye, it is, nevertheless, easily proved round, as will appear from the
following reasons:
ist. From its having been repeatedly circumnlavigated.1
2d. From the circular- form of the earth's shadow, as observed in eclipses of the moon.
3d. The mast'- of a vessel, when approaching firom a distance, is always
seenl before the hull,4 though the latter is much the larger part.
642. In corroboration6 of the last argument is the fact, that when a
vessel approaches Lus, it seems to rise up out of the water, and wvhen it is
g,oing from us, it seems to sink beneath the water; neither of ti ese appearances would exist, wvere the intervening6 surface a perfect level.
643. The cauise of the earthl's sphericity' is very evident, if we consider
it a yielding mass of water, capable of ass,umings any form; then by the
force of gravity,9  every particle'~ contained in it, tending towards the
common centre, the globular form is the necessary consequence.
644. The deepest valleys and the loftiest mountains no more affect' - the
roundness of the earth, than the commonl inequalities1  on the rind of an
orange affect its general rotundity.?
645. The earth, vast as it seems to be, is, nevertheless, more than one million times smaller than the sun,
or, in ether words, it would take         more than one million
of worlds as large as our earth, to make one bodly                 as
large   as the sun.

LANDING eF COLUMBUS.
656. America, or the Western Continent, from its
extent and recent discovery, is often called " Thie New
World."
657. No such place as America was ever known, or
heard of, in Europe till discovered by Christopher Columbus, A. D. 1492, just 3442 years ago.
658. America was so called, not in honor of Columbus, to which he was most justly entitled, but of one
Americus Vespuccius, wh 1o cruised3 along its coast several years after its discovery.
659. Columbus was a native, of Genoa in Italy, and was born in 1447.3

IIe early manifested a preference for a sea-faring life, and received an edu
cation whlich qualified him to pursue it.
660. The great object which engaged the attention of all Europe, during
the life of Columbus, was to find a passage, by sea, to the East Indies. The
Portuguese had spent nearly half a century1 in making various attempts by
sailing rounld the Cape of Good Hope, and had succeeded only in crossing
the equator, on the western coast of Africa, when Columbus conceived his
great design of finding India by sailing west.
661. The sphlerical figure of the earth, which Columbus understood, made
it evident to his mind that the eastern continent could not comnprise the
whole globe; and that there must be another continent in the wrest to counterpoise, 2 as he supposed, the vast extent of land in the east.
662. He soon resolved on a voyage of discovery, in the execution of
which no hardships could appal, no dangers deter him. After seven years
of painful solicitation5 at the different courts6 of Europe, he finally prevailed on Ferdinand and Isabella, the king and queen of Spain, to become
the patrons7 of his enterprize.8
663. Ferdinand hesitated9 at first, but his queen Isabella, alive to the glory
which would accrue,1-~ from such an enterprize, if stucecessfuli, promptly assisted Colutmbus. She even went so far as to offer to pledgell herjewels on
his account. The fleet with which they furnished him, consisted of tlhree
small vessels and ninety men.
664. Tlsus poorly equiped' 2 he sailed firom Palos, in Spain, on Friday, tim
3d of August, 1492, and toolk a wvesterly course across the unexplored Atlantic Ocean. On the 12th of October following, lse discovered Guanahani,
one of thlle Bahamla Islands, which he named St. Salvador; and this was the
first land, ill America, ever seen by Europeaiss.
665. He made three other successfi1l voyages of discovery, but in the
mean time, experienced great distress from the foul aspersions"0 of his enemies.
666. -He was once carried home in irons, and basely stripped of all the
ffices and possessions in the New World, to which he was entitled, by the
promises of'lFerdinand. Hle died at Valladolid, on the 20th of lay, 1506,
beiisg 59 years of age.
667. W hen Columbus first visited America, he found it one vast wilderness, in the possession of an uncivilized,14 sutperstitious- race of beings, to
whom he and his followers gave the name of Indianls.

subsisted10; but hIis successors,i- the Spaniards, allured69 by the prospectof

vast quantities of gold and silver, practised towards the innocent natives, the
most attrocious' cruelties.
669. The AmLerican     continent extends     from   Cape
Horn, in 560  S. latitude to the Northern Ocean, a      distance of about 9000 miles, and has an average breadth
of 15 or 16 htundred nailes, containing about 15 millions
of square miles.
670. The northern part is but imperfectly known; late discoveries tend to
establish the fact, that there is a communicationl by water, from Baffin's
Bay to Behring's Strait. In thai case, the Northerin ocean will form its entire
northern boundary.
671. America, is less in     extent than    the  Eastern
Continent; and       probably less populous, but it excels
the other three quarters of the globe in the grandeuLr of
its mrountainis, lakes, rivers, and forests; in the number
and richness of its silver mines, and   in the  fireedom  of
its political institutions.
672. America stretches throughl four zones, having
every variety of soil and climate.          It is reckoned about
10~ colder than places in the same parallels, on the Eastern   Continent.
673. The population of America, consists        of thre
classes; Whites, Negroes, and Indians.
674. The whites are Europeans, and their descendants, who have migrated2 hither since its discovery.
675. The Negroes are descendants of Africans, who
were forced fi'rom their native country, and sold for
slaves.
676. The Indians are the aborigines,' and are      mosty savages.      They are still in possession of the greater
part of the continent.    They are of an    olive complexion, fierce aspect,4 tall, straight, and robust.5 They are

677. They live    in low   miserable   huts, called   wigwarns, and are almost destitute           of clothing, especially
in warm climates. What little they wear, is generally made of the skins of wild beasts.
678.  Ameriea     contains a   population   of about 40
millions, nearly one half of whom           are Whites, one ninth
perhaps Negroes, and the Indians including the mixed
races, making up the rest.
679. Many opinions have been formed as to the origin of the Indians in
this country, but the question still remains unsettled.
680. By some they are supposed to have passed across Behring's Strait,
firom Asia, a distance of only 40 miles, either in their canoes, or in the winter, on the ice. Either mode was practicable, 3 for the natives often sail,
beyond that distance in the open sea; besides a passage on the ice in the
winter, is both safe and easy.
681. From    the best accounts we have, it is probable
that the New World has not been inhabited more than
12004 years.
682. This continent is divided into North and South
America, by a line crossing the Isthmus of Darien, in
about 71o north latitude.

683. North America extends from the Northern
Ocean to the Isthmus of Darien, or Panama, in latitude
7Ao N.; its greatest length being 4500 miles, and its
average breadth- about 2600 miles, containing about 8
millions of square miles.
634. North America is divided into Greenland, British America, and the Russian Possessions, in the N.the Mexican States and G-uatinala, or Central America, in the S.-and the United States in the middle.
685. Its population is supposed to be about 20 millions, consisting of whites, Negroes, and Indians.
686. The Indians occupy all the northern, and a
large part of the western division of the continent, being by far the largest portion.
687. The difference in the temperature between this and the Eastern Continent, is not so great as wasformerly supposed.*
NORTH AMERICA. Q.. What is said( of the extent of North America? 683. How
is it divided? 684. Its population? 685. Which class is most numerous? 686.
* It has been considered that there was a difference of temperature, amounting to
severaldegrees, between places under the samn" parallel, on the Atlantic Coast,
and in the Mississippi Valley.  This supposition, folunded on the fact that certain vegetable productions, are fouind in mlore niorthern latitudes in the latter,
than in the former, has been shown by HI-imbolt, to be erroneous. That distinguished plhilosopher, explained the phenlomnenon, by an examination of the form and
direction of the two valleys in these two regions. In the Atlanltic region they are96
NORTH AMERICA.'688. The scanty information which we possess, respecting the northern
frontierI of Noith America, is owing to the immense masses of ice which are
often piled in firiglhtful precipices, one obove the other, so as most effectually
to preclude'- ali possibility of approach, eithlier by land or sea.*
689. Nlume ous expeditions ha-ve of!ate been fitted out in search of a Nor-thl
West passage, as it is called; that is, P. commnnication by water round the
northern part of North America, firom the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans.
All attempts to find this passage have as yet, prsoved unsuccessfIl.
690. The most important of these expeditious, have been inade by tne Ellnglish, under Capt Parry. He entered Baffin's Bay, and sailed i au northerly and westerly~ directioii, till his further progress was arrested by the ice.
In that cold and desolate region, he passed the wiiiter, and the next sprilng
he succeeded in reaching MX[elville, one of the Georgian islands, which lihe
nam.ed, lying in about 1100 W. longitude, the fiartlest point ever reached by
any navigator.

703. The United States are the most important political division on the Western Continent.
704. They     are  distinguished    for the freedom      and
excellence of their government; for the exceedingly
rapid increase in population and wealth, and for a general diffusion of knowledge       among the inhabitants.
7u5. All power is vested in the people. They make
their own laws, and choose from among themselves,
officers to execute them.

706. They have no hereditary' titles, such as Dukes,
Lords, Earls, Knights, &amp;c. as in many countries, men
being held to be "born free and equal."
707. There is no religion established by law   as in
most other countries; every man being allowed to
worship God, according to the dictates of his own
conscience.
708. The United States are about 3000 miles in
length, firom the Atlanltic to the Pacific, and about
1700 miles in breadth.
709. The climate, soil, surface, and productions are
various; there is generally produced, an abundant
supply of wheat, rye, barley, oats, Indian corn, with
garden vegetables and numerous kinds of fruit.
710. The winters in the northern parts are long and
severe, with abundance of snow; in the mniddle parts,
shorter and milder, and in the southern parts, snow is
not known, except on the mountains.    Spring commences in the southern parts, from   two to three months
earlier than in the northern parts.
711. The commerce of the United States exceeds
that of every other nation in the world, except England.  Cotton, rice, flour, and tobacco, are the principal exports.
