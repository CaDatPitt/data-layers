PREFACE.

This book is an introduction to Osgood’s Series of Ameri-
can Readers.

It is most carefully prepared ; and it includes every im-
provement in arrangement, typography, and illustration.

It is steadily and easily progressive. The difficulties are
few in the ﬁrst lessons, and are very gradually increased as
the work advances.

The lessons are composed entirely of monosyllables of one,
two, three, and a very few (only six) of four letters ; and no
words are found in any reading lesson which have not been
previously presented in a spelling" or word exercise.

All of the words at the head of each lesson are used in the
readinglesson which immediately follows them, at leas't once,
and some of them four or ﬁve times. This use of words, im-
mediately after learning them as words, must so completely
ﬁx them in the memory of the child, that he will not forget
them. i

To secure the greatest degree of success in the use of this
book, the‘ pupil must be so thoroughly’ drilled in the new
words at the head of the lessons, that he will be able to pro-
nounce them a’z'sz‘z'7zoz‘Zy and zm/zo.s‘z'z‘az‘z'7zgZy at sight. If this is
always done before the pupil is permitted to attempt the
reading lesson in which these new words ﬁrst occur, he will
be able to read without monotony, drazoizng, or /zes2'z‘cz2‘z'o7z.

The arrangement of this Primer is such, that it may be used
with equal facility by those who teach primary reading by the
word method, the phonic method, or the common method of
ﬁrst teaching the names of the letters.
