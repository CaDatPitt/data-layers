This necessity of changing with each

upon the device of being always in

For many years this form was satis-

began to question if after all the King
was good- To meet this doubt,

Apocrypﬁal

ya/272 Rogers’
Exhortation
unto his
children

VEN more famous than the
Erhymed alphabet, is the poem

of John Rogers, with the pic-
ture of the martyr burning at the
stake, and “ his Wife, with Nine small
Children, and one at her Breast ” look-
ing on. Much sadness this poem and
print must have cost the Puritan, and
even now, it is capable of producing
a sigh, no longer because one feels

- so keenly for the man, who regardless

of wife and children, insisted on being
burnt, and really forced the court
against its will to make a martyr of
him, but because a study of the facts
shows that the use of this poem and
Story was nothing but a piece of sec-
tarian garbling and falsehood, and that
all the pity spent upon it by millions
of readers was no more deserved than

that lavished upon the unfortunate
heroes and heroines of fiction.

‘The history of the poem so far as
can be learned is as follows. In the
sixteenth century there lived a man
of whom Foxe, in his “ Book of
Martyrs,” wrote:

“Robert Smith gave himself to service in
the house of sir Thomas Smith, knight, be-
ingthen provost of Eaton : from thence he
was preferred to Windsor, having there in
the college a clerkship of ten pounds a year.
Of stature he was tall and slender, active
about many-"things, but chieﬂy delighting
in the art of painting, which many times
rather for his‘ mind’s sake, than for any
gain, he did practice and exercise. In
religion he was fervent, after he had once
tasted the truth; wherein he was much
conﬁrmed by the preaching of Mr. Turner,
of Windsor, and others. Whereupon at

the coming of Queen Mary he Was de-
prived of his clerkship by her visitors; and
not long after he was apprehended, and
brought to examination before Bonner.”

At this point Foxe inserts an ac-

  count of the trial where Smith

“ vailantly stood in defence of his master’s
cause: and as thou seest him here boldly
stand in examination before the bishop and
doctors; so Was he no less comfortable
also in the prison among his companions_:
which also is to be observed no less in his
other fellow-prisoners, who being together

. in_ the outward room in Newgate, had godly

conference with themselves, With daily pray-
ing and public reading, Which they to their
great comfort used in that room together;
amongst whom Smith was the chief; Whose
industry was always solicitous, not only for
them of his own company, but also his
diligence was careful for other prisoners,

» Will show you some token thereof.

Whom he ceased not to dissuade from their
old accustomed iniquity; and many he
converted to his religion.

“The said Robert Smith, the valiant
and constant martyr of Christ, being thus
replenished as ye have heard, with the for-
titude of God’s Spirit, Was condemned at
London by Bonner their bishop, on the
I 2th of_]uly ; and sufFered at Uxbridge the
8th day of August; who as he had been
before a comfortable instrument of God to
all them that were in prison With him : so
now also being at the stake, he did no less
comfort the people, there standing about
him, Willinglthem to think Well of his
cause, and not to doubt but that his body
dying in the quarrel, should rise again to
life. And, said he, I doubt not but God
At

people, lifting up the stumps of his arms,
and clapping the same together, declaring a
rejoicing heart unto them ; and so bending
down again, and hanging over the ﬁre‘, slept
in the Lord, and ended this mortal life.”

To a skill in painting, Mr. Smith
added one in letters, and Foxe states
that “ while in prison he wrote several
letters t-o his friends, some in Verse,
and others in prose ”. These poetical

letters were nearly all in the same.

Far surpassing these poems in popu-

larity, however, was the “ Exhortation Writing and

vnto his children ” which he penned 
at this same time. Written in the tion unto his
year in which he was burned (1555), Children

it seems to have been printed first in

I 559 when the Stationers Company

directed that “Owyn Rogers hath

lycense to prynte t/ye Instruction for

C/yyldren ”. 1 It was accordingly issued

1-Arber’s “ Stationers’ Register,” I.,96.

Im‘7”oa’z¢cz‘z'o7¢

in that yea_r, in a little tract of Puritan
Writings, on the title of which it was
termed “ An exhortacion of Mathewe
Rogers, vnto his children ”, in the body
of the work it was retitled “ The in-
struction of a Father to his Children,

a which he wrote a few days before his

burnynge”, and at the end it was
signed “ Finis quod l\/Iathewe Rogers.”
It apparently proved a work, of some
popularity for in 1577 the Stationers
Company “Licensed vnto” John
Arnold the issuing of another edition
of the tract.

Why the name of Mathewe Rogers
Was substituted for that of the true
writer can not be discovered, unless,
Rogers being the earliest, and there-
fore the best known ofthe “ reformed ”
Martyrs, the printer reasoned that his

Im‘7"0c/ucz‘z'07¢

75

name would cause a greater sale. The
change of his true cognomen John to
Mathew, is more easily explained, for
under the pen name of Thomas
Mathew," Rogers had helped Tyndale
in translating the scriptures, and thus
he was often called Mathew Rogers.

But this foisting of the poem of
Smith on to Rogers by no means ended
the garbling. In the New England
Primer,~a short sketch of Rogers was
inserted, as follows:

“ Mr. John Rogers, Minister of the Gos-
pel in London, was the First Martyr in
Queen Mary’s Reign, and was burnt in
Smithﬁeld, February the 14th, 1554.. His
Wife with nine small Children, and one at
her Breast, follow’d him to the Stake, with
which sorrowful Sight, he was not in the
least daunted, but with wonderful Patience,

This is more remarkable for mis-
statement than for fact. Rogers was
a priest sworn to celibacy, who be-
coming converted, broke his vow and
took unto himself a Wife. When, on
the accession of Mary, he refused to
put the woman away, he was con-
demned to death, and was burned at
the stake on February 4th, 1555, (“ old
style” February the 14., 1554.) being,

as F oxe said “the first martyr of all

A the blessed company that suffered in

Queen Mary’s time, that gave the first
adventure upon the ﬁre ”. 1 Further-
more, his wife and children did not
see him burned, for F oxe merely stated
that : “‘ His wife and children, being

eleven in number, ten able to go, and
one sucking at her breast, met him by
the way as he went towards "Smithﬁeld:
this sorrowful sight of his own ﬂesh
and blood could nothing move him,
but he constantly and cheerfully took
his death with wonderful patience, in
the defence of the gospel of Christ”.

Worth noting in this connection is
one question over which there has
been much controversy, being the

fatherless. The Primer, as will be
seen, gave him “ nine small children and
one at the breast” but printers ‘read
this differently, sometimes giving nine,
and sometimes ten, in the picture.
At his trial, Rogers said distinctly that
he had ten children, while Foxe 1 speaks

INTRODUCTION

N the apocryphal poemiof John
Rogers “ unto his children,”
which was included in every New

England Primer, he said :

“ I leave you bore a little boo/Ee
For you to 100.46 «vi-ban,
That you may see _yourfatber’s_face
When I am dead and gon.”

No better descriptioniof the New Eng-
land Primer itself could be penned.
As one glances over what may truly

be entitled “ The Little Bible ‘of New

England,” and reads its stern lessons,
the Puritan mood is caughtwith abso-

lute faithfulness. Here was no easy

of his “ children, being eleven in num-
ber, ten able to go, and one sucking ”.

‘The explanation of this discrepancy is

probably due to the fact that Rogers
was held in prison for over a year, and
debarred during that period from all
news of his wife, in which time it is
obvious the eleventh child was born,
since at the time of his burning it was

_ still unweaned.

“Shorter Catechism” or John Cot-

in a number of editions both were in-
cluded. Several nineteenth century
editions of the New England Primer
contained besides the Assembly’s Cate-
chism, the Episcopal as Well, but no
early edition found contains what was

Mather termed it——-was framed by

Compared to —Herbert’s catechism‘

As a fact however this title was given
merely to distinguish it from the larger

that he was. to choose whether he
would be imprisoned for a stated time,
or before the Saturday night ensuing

whole of the catechism. Rev. Heman
Humphreys, though a Congregational
clergyman and the president of Am,-
herst College, acknowledged that his
recollection “accords with the expe-
rience of thousands, who-like myself,
once loathed the Assembly’s Cate-

by no means too strong. Another cler-

suﬂicient Cotton Mather even advised
mothers to catechise their children
“every day,” adding “you may be
continually dropping something of the
Catechism upon them : Some Honey out
of the Rock! ” and he told parents that :

Yet even Mather acknowledged that the
Shorter Catechism had diﬁiculties for
Very young children, by preparing a
briefer and simpler one, that instead of
taxing children of the “ Youngest and
Lowest Capacities,” with the catechism
of the Assembly, “This little Watering

not a drop of the heavenly dew con-

iNor was the catechism used only
for the catechising of the younger
generation, for itwas frequently made
the subject of sermons to the elder
portions of the congregation, Mather
relating that Rev. John Fiske “chose
the Assembly’s Catechism for his
public expositions, wherewith he twice
went over it, in his discourses before
his afternoon sermons.” The largest
book printed in New England before
the nineteenth century, was Samuel
Willard’s “ Complete Body of Divin-
ity in Two Hundred and Fifty Ex-
pository Lectures on the Assembly’s
Shorter Catechism ” ——- a mammoth
folio of over nine hundred pages, of
such popularity that before publication

Of the author Mather wrote:

Boston in Lincolnshire. Becoming
while there a non-conformist, he was
“ silenced ” for a while, but eventually
was allowed once more to preach, and
in his twenty years pastorate at Boston
“ he thrice went overthe body ofa’z"vz'n-
ity in a cater/Jz'stz'caZ way, and besides
his ‘ Lord’s day ’ sermons ” gave “ his
ordinary lecture every week, on the
week days, namely on Wednesdays and

BT/Jursalays, early in the morning, and

on Saturdays, at three in the after-

noon”, with such results to Boston

that “ religion was embraced, and prac-
ticed among the body of the people;
yea the mayor, with most part of the
magistrates, were now called Puritans,
and the Satanical party was become
insigniﬁcant ”. B

Finally the High Commission Court,
popularly known as the Star Chamber,
began proceedings against him, and
changing name and garb, Cotton took
ship for New England with two other
clergymen, the three lightening the
tedium of the passage by daily sermons
“all the while they were aboard, yea
they had three sermons, or expositions,
for the most part every day: of Mr.
Cotton in the morning, Mr. Hooker in
the afternoon, Mr. Stone after supper
in the evening”. Upon arriving
promptly made
“teacher” of the ﬁrst church there,
and very quickly came to wield a
power in that theocratic settlement
akin to that now exercised by a politi-
cal boss. He was invited to return

“Westminster Assembly” but de-
clined. Nothing perhaps better typi-
ﬁes the man than when on “being
asked why in his latter days he in-
dulged in nocturnal studies more than
formerly, he pleasantly replied, Because

Cotton presumably prepared the

Milk for Babes in 1641, at the time‘

the“ General Corte ” asked the elders
to prepare a catechism, as already re-
corded, and probably it was printed at
Cambridge by Daye, between 1641
and 164.5. .No copy of this edition
is known however, and the ﬁrst edi-
tion of which a copy is now extant is

was again printed there in 164.8 ‘and
1668, and in 1656 an edition was is-
sued at Cambridge in New England.
After 1690 its inclusion in many edi-
tions of the New England Primer
somewhatchecked the printing of
separate issues, but an edition in the
Indian tongue was printed at Boston
in 1691, and this was reprinted in

.1720. In 1702 Mather abridged and

combined it with the Assembly’s cate-
chism and one of his own and issued
it under the title of “ Maschil, or The
Faithful Instructor”, and other edi-
tions of this form of the work were
issued with the title of “ The Man of
God Furnished ” (Boston 1708) and
“ The Way of. Truth laid out”
(Boston 1721). In these, Mather
asserted that Milk for Babes “ will be

While by no means as popular as
Mr. Cotton’s metaphorical title would
lead one to expect, it must be con-
fessed that it is a decided improve-
ment on the Shorter Catechism, if not
in soundness of doctrine, at least in
length. In place of one hundred and
seven questions, there were but sixty-
four and instead of replies ranging in
length from eight to one hundred
words, one answer was a single word,
and the longest only contained eighty-
four.

HE last piece of any impor-

tance which can be consi-

dered‘ an integrant of the
New England Primer, is what was
called “A Dialogue between Christ,
Youth and the Devil”, a poem relat-
ing to a tempted youth, who .despite
the warning of his Redeemer suc-
cumbs to the wiles of the horny footed
tempter, and makes an effectiveexirt

i at the end of the dialogue without the
assistance of any stage directions, but
with, it is: presumable, the glare of
subterranean regions,~in place of the

more professional calcium light.
This dialogue form was a favorite
medium of the seventeenth century.
In 1671 Thomas Sherman issued a
tract called “Youth’s Tragedy, drawn
up by way of Dialogue between Youth,

Soul, and the Nuncius”,which was
many times reprinted. , So too, an
anonymous poem entitled “ An Excel-
lent Example toall young Men, being
a Dialogue betwixt Youth and Con-
science and Satan ” was issued in
London in 1684.. Still a third, called
“The Youth’s Looking Glass, being
a divine. Dialogue between a young
Man, Satan, and our Saviour Jesus
Christ”, was printed without a date.

None of these were the same as the

no printing of it can be found pre—dat—

it seems probable that it was composed
by the man whom Dunton described

It is proper to note that unlike the

portions already described it was not

always included in the New England
Primer, but as it is contained in the
Bradford fragment, and in Harris’
“ New English Tutor ”, as well as in
nine editions of the Primer‘ printed in
the eighteenth century, it has seemed
best to treat it as one of the true
pieces that went to mark the little

can be positively identiﬁed, but as they
go to make a history of the book, and
as their chronology is of some value
in settling the approximate decade of
imperfect copies of the Primer, they
deserve some attention.
In the second edition of the Primer,
Prayer of as the advertisement states, the Prayer
E‘1‘‘‘W‘1V 1”’ of Edward VI, taken from Foxe’s
“Book of Martyrs” was given, and
this prayer appears in the “ New

contains It.

“ Numeral Letters and Figures, which

None of these were included in the
later eighteenth century editions.

In the edition of 1737 a longish
_“ Verses for Children” beginning
“Though I- am but’ a little one”
appeared for the ﬁrst time, and was
included in many subsequent editions.
This edition also gave a part of the
“Duty of Children towards their
Parents” which had been given in
the “ New English Tutor ”. The only
other edition with this was one printed
in London in 1781. Most remark-
able of all in this edition was its
printing of the lines:

“Now I lay me down to sleep

alphabet other material alterations
were introduced. In the earliest edi-

Divine Song for Children, his Cradle

‘ vice to his Children,” “ Agurs Prayer,”
(which had appeared in the “New

these" additions proved. fairly popular,
though the parts by Watts were the
most so, and they formed the text of
most editions of the Primer issued
between 1762 and 1790. A minor
addition was the insertion of a short
set of questions, beginning “ Who was
the ﬁrst Man ”, and all to be answered
from the Bible. This was lengthened
or shortened at the Will of each
printer, and in the Salem edition of
1784. the printer so far departed
from sacred text, as to ask “Who
saved America” and-.“ Who betrayed
America,” the answers being “ George
Washington ” and “ Benedict Arnold.”

About 1790 a very marked change

and the naughty urchin was only
threatened with beggary while the good
boy was promised “ credit and reputa-

of a short poem which should have

The change, nevertheless proved pop-
ular, alas, and quite a number of
editions between I 790 and I 800 contain

more or less of these worldly additions.

, Of these successive variations in the
American primer, British editions took
no heed, and they constitute a class by
themselves. Although Harris’ issue
of the Primer in Old England con-

later English editions did not include

“ The History of the Creation,” a
poetical “ Advice to Children,” a “ Col-
lection of the best English Proverbs,”
and a number of shorter pieces.

signature it is a safe assumption that
these two books each began with a
portrait of the Royal personage reign-
ing at the time of their issue. The
Protestant Tutor of 1716 has a cut of
George I. The Primer of 1737 gives
a very fairly executed portrait of
George II. In 1762, though news of
the death of this monarch had reached
Boston, yet in an edition of the book
printed there in that year, there either
was too little time, or the printer was
too economical, to prepare a new cut,
so an additional stroke of the burin
changed a II.’ into a III., and thus a
portrait of George III. was impro-
vised, which in its striking likeness to
his father clearly shows the wonderful

inﬂuence of heredity.

The Primer of 1770 was more his-

only exception to the use of his feat-
ures, when any portrait was given in
subsequent editions, is one of Isaac
Watts printed in a V/Vorcester edition
issued about 1850.

The changes in the rhymed alphabet
cuts have already been described.
One important fact however, is the
use of some of the little pictures in a
work written by Harris entitled “ The
Holy Bible In Verse.” Harris adver-
tised this ‘book as early as 1701, and
in an edition printed in 1717 all of the
cuts are clearly taken from his edition
of the New England Primer.

The print of John Rogers at the
stake has also been mentioned. There
is a picture of the scene in FoXe’s
“ Book of Martyrs,” but this departs
from the standard of the Primer cuts,

more an instinctive longing of man-
kind than an Old Testament promise.
They were too imbued with the faith
of Judaism not to preach a religion of
stem justice, and the oldest Puritan
literature and even laws read strangely
Hebraic to nineteenth century eyes.
The religion of Christ, a faith based
on love and mercy, received less sym-
pathy and less teaching, from their
divines than probablyfrom, any other
sect nominally Christian. Salvation
from hell was what they promised;
while, to make this boon the greater,
the horrors and tortures were magni-
ﬁed and dwelt upon; and that the
terror might_be the greater, God was
made sterner and more cruel than any

living judge, that all might be brought

them is contained in the “ New Eng-

Harris’ edition" of the “Protestant

most curious of all is that contained

the guards are costumed in the local
militia uniform of the day, with great

less odd is that in the Lansingburg,

it is exactly like them with the excep-
tion of» the addition of a tiara to the
otherwise naked ﬁgure.

from the body, Harris added a key
or explanation which replaced Aries,
Taurus, Cancer, Scorpion, etc., with
Heresy, Disorder, Malice, Murder
and Treachery, etc., and which called
on the “, Child ” to “behold that Man
of Sin, the Pope, worthy thy utmost
Hatred.” This print was reproduced
in the Primer of I737, but no key was
added, so that the “ Child ” must have
been not a little puzzled to know what
the rays and letters meant. '

i There was a Worse lapse, however,
in this edition of 1737, for the last‘

To ﬁnd such a print in the godly
New England Primer is perhaps the
most curious fact yet known, and can
only be accounted for by the proba-
. bility that its purchasers were so
ignorant of the appearance of the
“ Devil’s-' picture cards ” that they did

not recognize 1tS prototype. l

given in the Salem edition of I784,
and some of these prints were used

in other issues printed in the decade
1790-1800. This Salem edition con-
tained pictures of “a little boy and
girl bestowing charity” and “a good
Boy and Girl attheir Books.” More
important still ‘was its inclusion of
certain prints of animals taken from
the “ Royal Primer,” which, with the
already described poems, was the first
true bid for popularity the Primer had
ever ‘made. Some other worldly prints
were included, among them two de-
signed to teach the alphabet, no ‘longer

by Bible extracts, but by pictures of ~

playthings, animals, etc.

This secularizing was an attack by
its friends from which the book never
quite recovered, for the printers having
once found how much more saleable
such primers were, and parents having

to realize how slight a chance even
the? least erring had of escaping eternal
damnation.

But in this Very accentuation of the
danger lay the strength of Puritanism.
No mass or prayer, no priest or pastor,
stood between man and his Creator,
each soul being morally responsible
for its own salvation; and this tenet
forced every man to think, to read, to
reason. As the Reformation became
possible only when the Bible was
cheapened by printed versions, so the
moment each man could own and
study the Book, Puritanism began.
Unless, however, man could read, in-
dependence was impossible, for illit-
eracy compelled him to rely upon
another for his knowledge of the
Word; and thus, from its earliest in-

found how much more readily their
children learned, both united in en-
couraging more popular school-books,
and very quickly illustrated primers,
which aimed to please rather than to
torture, ‘Were multiplied. The New
England Primer made a.“ brave ﬁght,
but it was a hopeless battle. Slowly
printer after printer abandoned the

printing of editions of the little Work, ‘

in favor of some more popular compi-
lation. It was driven from the cities,
then from the villages, and ﬁnally from
the farm houses. Editions were con-
stantly printed, but steadily it lost its
place as a book of instruction. In the
schools it was replaced by other and
better books, and though an edition

I T is impossible to measure the

work ‘the’ Primer accomplished.
If the Puritan exodus is viewed
with the eyes of the Hon. William

'Stoughton, who asserted that “God

sifted a whole nation that he might
send choice grain into this wilder-
ness,” there was little left for the
Primer to do. This however is a
public speaker’s View, and therefore
probably approximated more to what
would-please his audience, than to the
truth. Certainly the court records of
early New England reveal a condition
akin to all frontier settlements in law-
lessness and -immorality, and in pro-

portion to population show a greater
percentage of most crimes than would
be found even in our large cities of
to-day, bearing out the statement of
the Rev. John White,——-a leading
Puritan —- that a large part of the first
settlers of New England were “a mul-
titude of rude ungovernable persons,
the very scum of the land.” It is

‘related that a newly installed New

England pastor said to a spinster
parishioner “I hope, madam, you be-
lieve in total depravity,” and received
the prompt response: “Oh, parson,
what a ﬁne doctrine it would be, if
folks only lived up to it.” There was
far more living up to total depravity
in early New England than most
people suspect, and when one reads

their own ministers, it is not difﬁcult
to realize why the New England
clergy dwelt so much on the terrors
of hell; one even becomes sympathetic
with the Presbyterian clergyman who

said with disgust that “ the Universal-—

ists believe that all men will be saved,

_ but we hope for better things.” What-

ever the- first years of . New England
may have been, however, the church
and the school were at work,-and what
they did needs no other monument
than the history of the last two hun-
dred years. The New England Primer
is dead, but it died on a victorious
battle ‘field, and its epitaph may well
be that written of Noah Webster’s
Spelling Book:

"‘ It taught millions to read, andnot

one to sin.”

Independency, no less than Papacy
and Episcopacy, was able to foresee
the danger of individualism in that it
threatened to result in a man’s not
finding in the Bible the one belief by
which alone the Puritans held he could
be saved. Think for himself he must,
but it was his duty to think What the
Separatists thought, and so churches
were gathered, and “teachers”——as
they were first .called—--were chosen,
who told their congregations What
they were to think for themselves.
Very quickly organized sects followed,
which formulated creeds and cate-
chisms, demanded belief in them, and

tortured, imprisoned and exiled the
recalcitrant. Finding that other men,
like themselves, could not be made by
punishment to accept other than their
own opinions, the children were taken
in their earliest years,1 and drilled and
taught to believe what they were to
think out for themselves when the age
of discretion was reached. And this
was the function of the New England
Primer. With it millions were taught
to read, that they might read the Bible;
and with it these millions were cate-
chised unceasingly, that they might
ﬁnd in the Bible only what one of
many priesthoods had decided that

book contained.

1 John Trumbull, the poet, records of himself that
“ beforehe was two years old, [he] could say by heart
all the verses in the ‘ Primer.’ ”

HIS method of securing uni-

formity by uniting alphabet

_ and creed was as old as printed

books. The Enschedé Abecedarium,
which has even been claimed to be the
first specimen of printing with type,
and which certainly was printed in the
fifteenth century,1 contained besides
the alphabet, the Pater Noster, the Ave
Maria, the Credo, and two prayers,
being the elementary book of the Rom-
ish Church. So too, a larger book
of Catholicism, for more advanced
students, was the well-known “ Book
of Hours ” 3 which, translated from the
Latin text into English? was called
“ The Prymer of Salisbury use ”, and
was printed as early as I490. «As

1 De Vinne’s “ Invention of Printing,” 290.
'3 “ The Prymer of Salysbury use.” Paris : 14.90.

And they that do deﬁle the fame.
. {hall furely come to nought’.
36 never Proud by any means,
build not thy houfc too high,
But always have before yeur eyes.
that you are born to die. '

Defraud not him that hired is,
your labour to ftrﬁain;

And pay him ﬁill without delay,
his wages for bis pain.

And as on would another Man
again you ﬂiould proceed,

Do you the fame to them again.
if they do (land in need.

Import your Portion to the Poor,
io.Moncy and in Meat,

And {end the feeble fainting Soul
of that which you do eat.

AsklCounfcl always of the wife,
give ear unto the end,

‘And :12’: rcfufe the {wcet rebuke

‘ofhim that is my Friend.
'Be.a1ways thankful to the Lord,
with Prayer and with Praifc,

And then be fut-c that he will bids

need hardly be said there are many

When the Reformation began to
work among the people -in England,
among its signs was the appearance of

unauthorized primers, and Henry the

VIII. issued “proclamations” and
“injunctions” against these, in an
endeavor to- keep his people true to
Catholicism. Very soon, however,
he experienced a change of heart not
merely towards his wedded wife, but
incidentally as well, towards his
mother church, and in 1534., as one
method of fighting the Pope, he allowed
to be "prepared and issued what is

known as the “Reform Primer”,1_

designed to teach his people what they
should believe. In this, however, his
desire to have done with the Church
of Rome, led him to act too hastily,
for in less-than a year, he varied his
belief and licensed the issue to his
people of a “ Goodly Prymer in Eng-
lysshe”1 that they might know the
only true and revised-to-date religion.
Yet 5 again new light came to the
head of the English church, and in a
third primer, known as the “Henry
Vlllth Primer ”,2 the King marked out

1 “A goodly Prymer in Englysshe, newly cor-
rected and printed, with certeyne godly Meditations
and Prayers added to the same, Very necessarie and
profitable for all them that ryghte assuredly under-
stande not ye Latine and Greke tongues. Cum
privilegio regali.” [London, 1535.]

2 “ The Primer set forth by the King’s Majesty,
and his Clergy to be taught, learned, and read and none

other be used throughout all his dominions. 154.5.
Cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum.”

portions intended for “ beginners ”,
such ‘as “ a fruitful and very Christian
instruction for children”, and since
the Rom_ish Church had a preliminary
book to its Prymer, so Henry had his,
called “ The A B C”.,1 the earliest
known copy of which contains the
alphabet, the Lord’s Prayer, the Hail
Mary, the Creed, Various Graces for
before and after “ dyner” and for
“fysshe dayes”, and the “ten com-

tween the two was well indicated by
a little poem at the end of the A B C2
printed in black letter in 1636 :

complained that there had come to be

debarred from doing it and to the
privileged printers there was no ob-

‘price. It was left, therefore, to the

publishers of Separatist persuasion, to
take advantage of the larger sale that
could be obtained, and very quickly
they were issuing at low prices, books
which contained the sum of both; and
no doubt this cheapness and conveni-

The earliest of this combination
of school—book and catechism, so far

One of the gravest diﬂiculties to P

the early Separatists in both Old and
New England, was the question of
what catechism to teach their chil-

a contract with sundry “intended
ministers” for “catechising, as also
in teaching, or causing to be taught
the Companyes servants & their chil-
dren, as also the salvages anditheir
children”.,1 and in this same year
(1629) they voted the su—m of three
shillings for “ 2 dussen and ten cate-
chismes”.2 It cannot certainly be
known to what particular catechism
these allusions refer, but it was prob-
ably the one composed by “that
famous divine” William Perkins,
preacher of St. Andrews Church in

of Christ college, and one of the

catechism ran through many editions

Very quickly after the Puritan
settling in America a tendency de-
veloped towards the individualism
implied by all dissent and especially
by Congregationalism. As a. result
of this diversity of belief, Lechford
states that catechising was generally
abandoned in many of the New Eng-
land churches, and to meet the woe-
ful conditionthe “General’Corte”
in 1641 ,“ desired that the elders

seem to have been not a‘ little trying
to a congregation, on the death of
a trusted shepherd who had properly
inducted them in his own belief, to
get accustomed to the doctrines of

‘ a new incumbent. This difficulty

was for the most part avoided by
the general knowledge of what each
clergyman thought, so that only one
in fairly close accord with the con-
gregation was considered. When a
mistake occurred, and the “ Teacher”
was found to run counter to his
church, they hastened to get rid of
him, which resulted in the ‘innumer-
able church quarrels and the schism
with which New England so abounded.

with evident pride that “few Pastors

was forced to acknowledge that “the

Harris began printing in London “ at
the Stationers Arms in Sweethings
Rents,.near the Royal Exchange”,
otherwise described as “ the Stationers
Arms under the Piazza in Cornhill”.
Here he issued, between ‘the years
1676 and 1681 many tracts and
broadsides of so little moment that
his name finds no mention in any
biographical dictionary or history of
printing. , But aside from his calling,
Harris deserves notice as a conﬁrmed
scribbler, resembling Mr. Wegg, in
his tendency to drop into verse. To
this was added an ardent love for the
protestant religion, and an equal hatred
of the Pope and all that he implied.
So long as the printer limited his
activity to the writingand printing of
ballads and tracts against the Pope and

of Iniquity,” all went well with him,
but in 1679, in connection with the
“Rye House Plot” he issued “ An
Appeal from the Country to the City,
for the Preservation of His Majesties
Person and the Protestant Religion”.
The King’s government did not take
the same View of the question that
Mr. Harris had, andas a result he was
brought to trial for the “ printing and
vending” of this tract. The courtly
tendency towards Catholicism gave
little chance for the printer, and the
chief justice, after remarking that if he
had his wish, the printer should be
Whipped, ordered him to find security
for his good behavior for three years}

- Unwarned by his experience, Harris
in 1681 printed a “Protestant Peti-
tion ”, and was once more haled before
the court and this time the judge ﬁned
him ﬁve hundred pounds and ordered
him put in the pillory. This meant‘ that
he was to be stoned by the crowd
which always gathered, but from that
fate he was saved, for “ his Wife (like
a:Kind Rib) stood by him to defend
her Husband against the Mobb”.1
For this act, his enemies promptly
turned their abuse upon the woman,
and- scurrilous ballads entitled “ The
Saint turned Courtezan” and the
“Protestant Cuckold” endeavored to
bring discredit upon her. The printer
apparently could not pay the mulct,
for he was “for above two years a

lUpon the death of Charles  and
the succession of Catholic James “ Old

Boston, “ is now so uneasie a Place

~ Come to Boston Harris did and late
in 1686 he set up a book and “ Coffee,
Tee and Chucaletto” shop,1 by the
“ Town-Pump near the Change ”. A

year later his imprint reads “ at the

London Collee House ” and he was
employing the printers of the town to
print pamphlets and broadsides for him.
Here too he was quickly involved with
the authorities, for in" 1690 he issued,
without permission, the first newspaper
printed in-America, under the title of
“ Public Occurrences ”; which was
promptly suppressed by proclamation.
In 1691 he formed a partnership with

John Allen, and seems to have set up
a press of his own.

A year later’ he
became “ Printer to His Excellency

the Governor and Council”, and re-

moved his business to a “Shop, over
against the Old-Meeting House”, mak-
ing another remove in 1694. to a place
which he called “ The Sign of the
Bible, over against the Blew-Anchor ”,
having ended his relations with Allen.

In the meantime the English peo-
ple had stood ﬁrm to their religion and
had rid themselves of their king, so
that now Old England was once more
safe to haters of popery. Better still,
King William, whose advent Harris
hailed in a poem beginning:

“God S.4VE THE KING, t/mt King

features of governmental restraint.

Accordingly, Harris returned to Lon-
don towards the end of 1695, and
opened a new printing oﬁice at the
“Maiden-I-Iead—Court in Great East
Cheap”, and "later Dunton writes that
he “ continu’d Ben Harris still; and is
now both Bookseller and Printer, in
Grace—church Street, as We ﬁnd by'his
London Post; so that his conversation is
general (but never Impertinent) and his
Wit pliable to all Inventions. .But yet
his vanity (if he has any) gives no Alloy
to his Wit, and is no more than might
justly Spring from conscious Vertue;
and I do him but Justice in this part of
his Character, for in once ‘travelling with
him from Bury Fair, I found him to be

panion that I had ever met with”.1

The Protes-

becomes The
New England
Primer A

Ere this, in 1686, Harrishad sought
refuge in New England. On his set-
ting up in Boston as a bookseller it

was obviously to his interest to get out

anew edition of the little book, for its
chance ofsuccess among the popery-
hating New Englanders was even
greater than that it had alreadymet
with in Old England. The poverty of
the people made prudent. an abridg-
ment of the “Tutor ” and thus it was
reduced to smaller bulk ; to make it the

more salable the school-book character _

was increased, while to give it an even

i better chance for success by a.n appeal

to local pride, it was rechristened and
came forth under the now famous title.

No copy of this ﬁrst edition of the
New England Primer is known and
thus the exact date of its appearance

cannot be given. Harris did not ar-
rive in Boston till near the end ‘of
1686, and theionly publication he
issued in that year was an almanac
for 1687, which Sewall bought on
December 6, 1686. Between that
time and Jan. 5, 1688, Harris made
a trip toilingland, and on Nov. 22,
1688 he again sailed for London.1 It
was between 1687 and 1690, there-
fore, that the first edition of the Primer
was issued. Its success seems to have
been immediate, for in Henry New-
man’s almanac entitled “News from

the Stars”, “Printed by R. Peirce"

for Benjamin Harris at the London
Coffee-House in Boston, 1691 ” (and
consequently printed late in 1690)

fragment

pression of The New England Primer,
Enlarged”.

\A very essential piece of evidence
in regard to the date of the book is
connected with the earliest (supposed)
fragment of the Primer known. This
consists of four leaves, and was found
bound up as waste in the binding of a
copy of Daniel Leeds’ “Temple of
Wisdom” as printed by William
Bradford, at Philadelphia in I688.
From this it has been argued that
“these leaves probably came from_a

\Philadelphia reprint of a Boston edi-
tion of the Primer which must have

been published at least as early as
I687”. The evidence of this does
not seem adequate. There is no
proof that the volume was bound in

~ the year that it was printed, nor can

[M706/zzcz‘z'o7¢

it be decided for certain that the frag-
ments are a reprint of the Primer, the
chances being quite as favorable of
their being part of an edition of the
Protestant Tutor. All that can be
said of these leaves is that they are
the earliest known fragments of a book
compiled by Benjamin Harris, and that
they were printed by William Brad-

ford either in Philadelphia or New

York between 1687 and I700. From
other .facts known of Bradford this
was presumably a stealing of Harris’s

book and‘ is therefore an early Ameri-

can case of literary theft.

The book proved so great a success
in New England that when its com-
piler returned to Old England, he
continued to publish it. In a work1

.He seems to have also published edi-
tions of it under a title whichwould
‘make it more attractive to the Eng-
lish public, for in the reign of ,Queen
Anne (1702-1714) he issued what is
presumably the same text as his New
England Primer, under the title of
1“ The New English Tutor”. But
the other title proved the more popu-
lar, and under it numerous editions
were printed in England and Scotland,
even into the nineteenth century.

“New England Primer” became the
deservedly established title.

For one hundred years this Primer
was t/ye school-book of the dissenters
of America, and for another hundred, it
was frequently reprinted. In the unfa-
vorable locality (in a sectarian sense) of
Philadelphia, the accounts of Benjamin
Franklin and David Hall show that be-
tween 174.9 and 1766, or a period of
seventeen years, that firm sold thirty-
seven thousand one hundred copies.
Livermore stated in 184.9 that within
the last dozen years “ 100,000 copies
of modern editions . . . have been cir-
culated”. An over conservative claim
for it is to estimate an’ annual average
sale of twenty thousand copies during a

LTHOUGH each printer of
the New England Primer
changed title and text to suit
his taste or business interests, certain
unmistakable ear-marks, or what the
naturalist would term “limit of
organic variation”, serve -to mark
beyond question every edition of the

Im‘roa’ucz‘z'o7z

49

Primer, however titled or altered.
The printers of other school-books
often inserted fragments of the more
famous Primer in their ventures, but
this deceived neither the public then
nor the book lover now, the true
Primer being too sharply differentiated
from all others for there to be the
possibility of confusion.

Every New England Primer, like
many. others, began with the letters
of the alphabet, followed by various
repetitions making clear the distinc-

tions between vowels, consonants,
double letters, italic and capitals.
After this came what was called

“Easy Syllables for Children,” or as

it was frequently termed, the “sylla-

barium,” beginning with such com-

binations as “ab, eb, ib, ob, ub,”

and .v_yIlr1[2a-

followed -by words of one syllable
which lengthened by degrees to im-
posing vocables of six syllables. It
is to be noted however, that occa-
sionally when the printer was cramped
for space, he limited the ambition of
the student by dropping out these
polysyllabic Words, and gave only
the shorter ones. This Whole ele-
mentary section of the primer had
been used in Coote’s “The English
Schoolmaster,” as early as 1596, and
may have been framed by him, but
as the first part is practically what
went to make ‘the Horn-Book of the

period, its antiquity may be far greater

than Coote’s book.

beginning of the alphabet of the >14
which otherwise was so almost in-
variably placed there, as .to give to

the first line of the alphabet the name V

of “Christ’s Cross-Row” or as it
was_ more commonly termed “the
Cris Cross Row.” In ’lVlorton’s
“ New English‘ Canaan” he speaks
of “a silenced Minister” who came
over ‘to New England and brought
“a great Bundell of Home books
with him and careful hee was (good
man) to blott out all the crosses of

land should become Idolaters.” Of
this Puritan dread of the cross, the

to make the Primer famous

pictures,

with alphabetical rhymes,
commencing

older date. As early as I552 there
was printed in England a little tract
entitled “Alphabetum primum Be-
cardi,” which consisted of rhymes to
each of the letters, and another Work
of this period of exactly the same
character was entitled “Finch his
Alphabet”. So, too, a little later a
broadside was issued, headed A“- All the

Letters of the A. B. C. by every son-.

drye Letter wherofther is a good Docu-
ment set fourth and taught in Ryme.
Translated out of Bas-Almaine into
English, anno 1575 ”. An even further
development of this was contained in
Wastell’s “ Microbiblion, or the Bibles
Epitome“ (London 1629) containing
the sum of the whole, in Verse so capi-

talized as to form successive alphabets._

early as 1623.

Who was the author of the New
England Primer alphabet verses is not
known, no text of it before its print-
ing in that work having been found,
It could not have been written long

a before the first appearance of that book,

for the rhyme :
“ T/ze Royal Oak
It was tée Tree
T /zaz‘ sa*v’a' /zis
Royal Zllajesty,”
by its allusion to King Charles, clearly
shows it to have been composed after
1660. All thispoints to the compiler
of the Primer as its author, for in other

poems he expresses the greatest admira- ,

tion for the Merrie l\/lonarch, and as
already noted, he was continuallyscrib—
bling verse quite of the character of the
rhymed alphabet.

All these enigmas are made clear how-

Moral History of his Life and Death.

applicable to each Fable.” 1 This

booklet, “ Written by B. H.” or Ben-

jamin Harris, contains a series of dog-
gerel Verses appended to the “ curious
cuts” and’ when Mr. Harris came
to make his alphabet Verses for the
Primer, with a frugality of mind" that
would have charmed Mr. Gilpin, he
took certain of the illustrations from

this other book, and by rewriting his
rhymes, utilized them anew in the
Primer verses.

It is a curious fact that of all ‘these
twenty—four stanzas only the first one,
relating to Adam, was not at some
time varied or changed, and these vari-
ations give a curious illustration of
some very important alterations of
public opinion. Thus in the earliest
text extant, at the letter] is given a pic.-
ture of the cruciﬁxion, with the stanza

“ Sweet fesus /ze
D_y’d on a Tree.”
And in an English school-book of other
character than the Primer, this was un-
changed. The Puritan, however, would
notktolerate even this use of the cross,
and so very quickly the picture was
changed to one of Job, and the rhyme to

I7zz‘roa'z¢ctz'o72

“ jobﬂels t/ze rod
Tet blesses God.”

Perhaps the most curious change is
that connected with the letter K.
Allusion has been made to Harris’s
admiration for King Charles, and there
is good evidence that for this letter
originally there wasa picture of that
monarch and the stanza read

“ King C/zarles z‘/ze Good
No Man q/“Blood.” 1

Presently however the King was dead,

and in a little time another king in the
form of William III. for Whom Harris

also felt a strong admiration, was reign- -’

ing over England. Thereupon the
portrait and stanza were presumably
changed by the insertion of one sing-
ing his praises. When William died
