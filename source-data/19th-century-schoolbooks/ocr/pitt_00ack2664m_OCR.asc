THE AMERICAN PRIMARY SPELLER has been prepared with
special reference to the wants of the younger children in
schools and families, in accordance with that steady and
easy progression which is a prominent characteristic of the
Progressive Series.
In orthography, pronunciation, and syllabication, the latest
edition of Webster's Unabridged Dictionary has been taken
as a guide.
There seems to be a growing demi.s,nd, among the thinking _.
and progressive teachers of our land, thit.-.the subject of   
spelling should be presented in such a way that the puipil may:.
as far as practicable, acquire a knowledge of the meatni,
of words at the time he learns their orthography. To mee
this demand, as far as possible in a work of this character-.
has been a constant aim in the preparation of this book, as;--:;,
will be seen by reference to the suggestive exercises scattered."'
throughout this little work, and the examples of Oral or
Written Language Practice which are to be found at the foot
of almost every page.
Those who may not wish to adopt the plans recommended
in the book, but prefer the methods to which they have been
accustomed, will find by an examination of this book, that
it contains a system of spelling lessons as carefully graded,
and as well adapted to their purpose as any other book in use.
Trusting that this little book may prove a valuable.id in
the educational sphere for which it has been prepaird, we
send it forth bespeaking for it the kind receptiorind indulgent favor of the educators of our land.

IA WORD TO TEACHERS.
FELLOW TEACHERS: -In addition to the directions and
illustrations given, and the suggestions made throughout the
book, the following remarks may be properly offered:
By a careful examination of the following pages, it will be
found that they present a carefully graded course of spelling
lessons, interspersed withl-a'ggestive exercises, systematically
araniged, for the purpose of arousing interest and attention,
and elic; Ding thought on the part of the pupil; thus rendering
/the spelling exercises, unusually interesting, instructive and
profitable.
Of course it is unnecessary to suggest to teachers, who are
abreast of the times in their profession, to require their pupils
to make free use of the black-board and of their slates
in their Exercises in Spelling, Sentence Making, Language
Practice, &amp;c.
If short daily drills in Phonic Spelling and Language
Practice be earnestly and faithfully persevered in, in connection with the Spelling Exercises, the most gratifying results
will be secured in good spelling, in distinct articulation, and
in the fluent and correct use of language.

TABLE OF ELEMENTARY SOUNDS.
The elements in the following table must be uttered by the teacher
first, and then by the class individually, or in concert. In order to
give each element correctly, pronounce the word containing it distinctly and forcibly, giving as much vocal prominence as possible to
the element under consideration, and then utter the element alone;
as ape, a; arm, a; bat, b, &amp;c. Let the practice upon this table be
continued until every Elementary Sound can be uttered correctly
and promptly.

ZOOLOGY is that part of Natural History which treats of animals.
Bees, flies, bugs, &amp;c., are called -Insects. Crabs, lobsters, and shrinps are
called Crustaceans. Both classes are called Articulates, or jointed animals.
Insect means cut in, or almost divided.  Crustaceans are covered with a
crust, or shell. Oysters, snails, russels, &amp;c., are called Mollusks. They
are soft-bodied, and generally covered with a shell. The star-fish, coral,
&amp;c., are called Radiates, because their parts radiate from a central axis.
The nautilus, conch, cone-shells, &amp;c., are called Univalves, because their
shell is single. Oysters, mussels, &amp;c., are called Bivalves, because their
shells consist of two parts. ORNITHOLOGY is the science of birds. ICHl -
