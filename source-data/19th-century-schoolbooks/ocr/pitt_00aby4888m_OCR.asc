4 Preface.

never was a time when the universal critic compelled a more scrupu-
lous regard to the technical grammar of the language than  ; and
yet there never was a time when skepticism was more rife respecting the
study of grammar, as a science, in our schools. L

The true method lies, we are sure, in the “ golden mean” between
these two extremes. Grammar is a science—it would not be worth
the teaching if it were not—and yet, of all grammars, the English
need not burden the memory with scholastic rubbish, or be set down
by the pupil as dry and proﬁtless. It can teach him the art of correct
speaking and Writing, and it can do this in a way that shall be attrac-
tive; we ask attention to our plan, and to this, our initial work—the
outgrowth of such a belief. ‘ L

The labor of memorizing from the page is here reduced to a mini-
mum. Much of the instruction is oral. In our “Hints for Oral In-
struction,” the teacher is put in possession of what seems to_ us the
most natural and “easy method of developing inductively every topic
that arises. This is to be done, in every case, immediately before such

topic is to be studied. A necessity is thus created beforehand for every

"rule, caution, and deﬁnition; and exercises, to clinch whatever has

been learned, are given without stint.
These are eminently “Graded Lessons in English.” The sentence
is our unit. Starting with the simplest, of two words, and bringing

in gradually, one after another, all kinds of modifying words, phrases,

and clauses, the apupil ascends, by the easiest stages possible, to ‘Com-

plex and Compound sentences.‘ Learning thus the oiﬁces of the parts
of speech, and how words are combined, he is required, all through

the book, in Lessons headed “ Sentence-Building,” to frame this now

Hints for Oral Instruction.——Hereafter, in the “ Hints,” we shall
drop the dialogue form, but we expect the teacher to continue it. A
poor teacher does all the talking, a good teacher makes the pupils talk.

The teacher may here refer to his talk about the classiﬁcation of
birds, and show that, after birds have been arranged.in great classes,
such as robins, spa.rrows, etc., these classes will need to be subdivided,
if the pupil is to be made thoroughly acquainted with this department
of the animal kingdom. So, after grouping words into the eight great
classes, called Parts of Speech, these classes may be divided into other
classes. For instance, take the two nouns city and Brooklyn. The
word city is the common name of all places of a certain class, but the
word Brooklyn is the proper or particular name of an individual of -this
class. We have here then two kinds of nouns,which we call Com-
mon and Proper. ' _

Let the teacher write a number of nouns on the board, and require
the pupil to classify them and give the reasons for the classiﬁcation.

To prepare the pupil thoroughly for this work, the teacher will ﬁnd
it necessary to explain why such «-words as music, mathematics, knowl-
edge, etc., are common nouns. Jllusic, e. g., isnot a proper noun, for
it is not a name given to an individual thing to distinguish it from
other things of the same class. There are no other things of the same
class—it forms a class by itself. So we call the noun music a common
noun. l ‘K

‘ _ CLASSES or PRONOUNS. _

The speaker seldom refers to himself by name, but uses the pronoun
I instead. In speaking to a person, we often use the pronoun you in-
stead of his name. In speaking of a person or thing that has been

96   . iiGraa’ea‘’ Lessons. in English.

mentioned before, We say he or she or it. These Words that by their

form indicate the speaker, the hearer, or the person or thing spoken of,
are called Personal Pr_onouns._ _ See Lesson 1 “ Hints.” f

Give sentences containing nouns repeated, require the pupils to
improve these sentences by substituting pronouns.

When We Wish to refer to an object that has been mentioned in
another clause, and at the same time to connect the clauses, We use a
class of pronouns called ‘Relative Pronouns. Let the teacher illustrate
by using the pronouns who, which, and that." See Lesson 57, “ Hints
for Oral Instruction.” L ' I - ~

. When We Wish to ask about anything Whose name is unknown, We use
a class of pronouns called Interrogative Pronouns. The interrogative
pronoun stands for the unknown name, and asks for it ; as, Who comes
here ? What is this ? ‘ .1 * ' ' I '

Both men were wrong. Let us omit men and say, Both were wrong.
You see the meaning is not changed—both is here equivalent to both
men, that is, it performs the oﬂice of an adjective and thatof a noun.
It is therefore an Adjective Pronoun.% Let the teacher further illustrate
the ofﬁce of the adjective pronoun by using the words each, all, many,
some, such, etc. i —

CLASSES oi: VERBS.

Hints for Oral Instruction.--The man caught‘ makes no complete as-
sertion, and is not a sentence. If I add the object complement fish, I
complete the assertion and form a sentence—- The man caught ﬁsh. The
action expressed by caught passes over from the man to the ﬁsh.
Transitive means passing over, and so all those verbs that express an.
action that passes over from a doer to something Which receives, are-.
called Transitive verbs. . _

Fish swim. The verb swim does not require an object to complete-
the sentence. No action, passes from a doer to a receiver. These verbs.
which express action that does not pass over to a receiver, and all those
which do not express action at all, but simply being or state of being,
are called Intransitive verbs.

Let the teacher write transitive and intransitive verbs on the board,. '

and require the pupils to distinguish them. d
When I say, I crash the worm, I express an action that is going on.
now, or in present time. I crushed the worm, expresses an action that.

took place in past time. As tense means time, we call the form crash.

the present tense of the verb, and crashed the past tense. In the sen-
tence, The worm crashed under my foot died, crashed, expressing the-.
action as assumed, is, as you have already learned, a participle ; and,
as the action is completed, we call it a past participle. Now notice-.

-that ed was added to crash, the verb in the present tense, to form the 

verb in the past tense, and to form the past participle. Most verbs
form their past tense and their past participle by adding ed, and so we
call such Regular verbs. ‘

the thought may be varied by adding modifying Words. You are now

by simply changing its form. The English language has lost many of

NOUNS AND PRONOUNS.——PERSON AND CASE.

Hints for Oral Instruction.—Nnmher and gender, as you have al-.

ready learned, are modifications‘ affecting the_ meaning of nouns and
pronouns. Number is almost always indicated by the ending; gender,
sometimes. There are two other modiﬁcations which refer not to changes
in the meaning of nouns and pronouns, but to their diﬁerent uses and

relations. In the English language, these changes are not often indicated 1
‘by a change of form. ‘ 

I Paul have Written. Paul, thon art.beside thyself. He brought

I Paul before. Agrippa. ‘In these three sentences the word Paul has

three dizferent uses. In the ﬁrst, it is used as the name of the speaker ;
in the second, as the name of one spoken to; in the third, as the name
of one spokenlof. You will notice that the form of the noun was not
changed. This change in the use of nouns and pronouns is called

Person. The Word I in the ﬁrst sentence, the Word thou in the second, ‘

and the Word he in the third have each a different use. I, thou, and
he are personal pronouns, and, as you have learned, distinguish person
by their form. I, denoting the speaker, is in the First Person; thou,

denoting the one spoken to, is in the Second Person; and he, denoting‘

the one spoken of, is in the Third Person. " ’

Personal pronouns and verbs are the - only words that distinguish pe1'son
by their form.

The hear killed the man. The man killed the hear. The bear’s grease
was made into hair oil. In the ﬁrst sentence, the bear is represented
as performing an action; in the second, as receiving an action ;. in the
third, as possessing something. So the Word bear in these sentences
has three different uses. These. uses of nouns are called Cases. The
use of a noun as subject is called the Nominative Case; its use as

I I0 . Graded Lessons in Englis/5.

object is called the Objective Case ; and its use to denote possession is
called the Possessive Case. V -

The possessive is the only case of nouns that is indicated by a change
in form.’ '

-A noun or pronoun’ used as an attribute complement is in the nomi-
native case. A noun or pronoun (following a preposition as the principal
Word of a phrase is in the objective case. I and he are nominative forms.
Me and him are objective forms. ‘

The following sentences are therefore incorrect: It is me; It is him;
_Me gave the pen to he.

POSSESSIVE FORMS.

.BULE.—The possessive case of nogng is formed in thesingular
by adding to the nominative the apostrophe and the letter s (’s);

in the plural, by adding C) only. If theplural does not end in s,

the apostrophe and the s are both added.

Write the possessive singular and the possessive pllzwall of

the following nouns, and place an appropriate noun after
each. . a »

’ Robin, friend, ﬂy, hero, woman, bee, mouse, cuckoo, fox, ox,‘ man,‘

thief, faBiryp,ypp.,mosquito, Wolf, shepherd, farmer, child, neighbor, cow.

Possession may be expressed also by the preposition of and
the objective ; as, the mosquito’s bill = the bill of the mos-
quito. t  
The possessive sign (’s) is conﬁned chiefly to the names
of persons and animals.

\“~~Hints for Oral Instruction.-——I picked the rose. I will tell the same

thing in another way. The rose was picked by me. The ﬁrst verb
°e picked shows that the subject I represents the actor, and the second
form of the verb, was picked, shows that the subject names the. thing

acted upon. This change in the form of the verb is called Voice. The
ﬁrst form is called the Active Voice; and the second, the Passive
Voice. j -

The passive form is very convenient when we wish to assert an ac-

Hints for Oral Instruction.—-When I say, James walks, I assert the
Walking as a fact. When I say, James. may walk, I do not assert the
action as a fact, but as a possible action. ‘When I say, If James walk
ouighe will improve, I assert the action, not as an actual fact, but as a

condition of J ames’s improving. When I say to James, Walk out, I do»

1 22- e Graded Lessons in Englis/2.

not assert that James actually does the act, I assert the action as 5.
command. . j ‘

The action expressed by the verb walk has been asserted in four dif-
ferent ways, or modes. The ﬁrst Way is called the Indicative Mode;
the second, the Potential Mode; the third, the Subjunctive Mode;
the fourth, the Imperative Mode. '

Let the teacher give other examples and require the pupils to repeat
this instruction.

For the two forms of the verb called the Inﬁnitive and the Parti-
ciple, see “ Hints,” Lessons 48 and 49. I . .

I walk. I walked. I shall walk. In each of these three sentences,
the manner of asserting the action is the same. I walk expresses the
action as present. _. I walked expresses the action as past, and I shall
walk expresses the action as future. As Tense means time, the ﬁrst
form is called the Present Tense; the second, the Past Tense; and the
third, the Future Tense. I

We have three other forms of the verb, expressing the action as com-
plated in the present, the past, or the future. — , -- '

I have _walked out to-day. I had walked out whenhe called. I shall
have walked out by to-marrow. The form, have walked, expressing the
action as completed in-the present, is called the Present Perfect Tense.
The form, had walked, expressing the action as completed in the past, is
called the Past Perfect Tense. The form, shall have walked, express-
ing an action to be completed in the future, is called the Future Per-
fect Tense. . I

Let the teacher give other verbs, and require the pupils to name and

explain the different tenses.

_ I walk. Thou walkest. He walks. They walk. ‘V
In the second sentence, the verb walk was changed by adding est ,°'
and in the third, it was changed by adding s. These ‘changes are for
the sake of agreement with the person of the subject. The verb ending
in est agrees With the subject thou in the second ‘person, and the verb
ending in s agrees with he in the third person. In the fourth sentence,

-the subject is in'the third person; but it is plural, and so the verb

drops the s to agree with they in the plural.
Verbs are said to agree in Person and Number With their subjects.
The person and number forms will be foundin Lessons 93, 94.‘

To the Teacher.-—Let. the pupils preﬁx do and did to the simple pres-
ent see, and thus make the emphatic form of the present and the past. tense.

Let can and must be used in place of may; and could, would, and should, in
place of might. _ i _

Require the pupils to tell how each tense is formed, and to note all changes
for agreement in number and person. '

A majority of modernwriters use the indicative forms instead of the sub-
junctive, in all of the tenses, unless it may be the present. The subjunctive
forms of the verb to be are retained in the present and the past tense.

Conjugatz'on of the Vera--Simple llorrn. 129

Let the pupils understand that the mode and tense forms do not always V,

correspond with the actual meaning. The ship sails next week. I may go to-
morrow. The verbs sails and may go are present in form but future in mean-
ing. If it rains by noon, he may not come. "The verb rains is indicative in
form but subjunctive in meaning. ’

The plural forms, You saw, You were’, etc., are used in the singular also.

)SUGGl-ESTIONS TO THE TEACHER.

WE think that these Lessons are adapted, in point of length, to pupils of
the average ability. But you must suit them to your class. Do not hes-
itate to make three Lessons out of two, if it be necessary, or even two out
of one. Consider the pupil’s age, studies, and time for recitation.

Please study carefully the “Hints.” Be prepared to put clearly before

your class the matter which they contain, but do it in the Way that seems
best to you—in oars if you prefer. Do it, /always, as part of the Lesson
preceding that in which they stand. ‘

See to it that the pupils do their own work in Written analysis. Collect
the diagrams before the recitation begins, and ask them to make oral analy-
ses of the sentences diagramed. Compare these with the written.

You can use the diagrams ‘for impromptu reviews. While some of the
class are reciting the advance Lesson, others can be at the board, putting in
diagram some difficult sentences in back Lessons. They are also very use-
ful in making blackboard illustrations.

Make a judicious use of’ these diagrams. They are fascinating to the pupﬂ,
and so are liable to misuse. Remember that they are only means to an end.
That end is the building of neat and correct sentences. Place great stress
upon this Sentence—Baz'ldtng. In recitation, let the pupils exchange papers
and read aloud, While the teacher and class criticise. Let some of the Work

be placed upon the board for criticism. You will be struck with the crude-

ness and even coarseness of some sentences, and the neatness and elegance
of others. Call attention to the best Work, and let it tone up the style of
the class.

.All grammatical inaccuracies in the class room should be promptly cor-

7 rected, but give the reason only when the study of the text has ‘prepared

the pupils for it. Give them something to anticipate.

Devise more Impromptu Exercises, if you ﬁnd them -serviceable in awak-
ening enthusiasm. In these and all other available ways, pique the ambi-
tion of the pupils, and keep their interest at a White heat.

To the Teacher.——After the pupils have become. thoroughly familiar
with the verb be as a principal verb, teach them to use it as. an auxiliary in
making the Progressive Form and the Passive Form. -

The progressive form may be made by ﬁlling all the blanks with the present
participle of some verb. ’ ‘

The passive form may be made by ﬁlling all the blanks With the past par-
ticiple of a transitive verb.

Notice that, after the past participle, no blank is left.

In the progressive form, this participle is Wanting; and, in the passive
form, it is the same as in the simple. I '

AGREEMENT _OF' THE VERB.
. To the Teacher.—For additional matter, see pp. 167, 171.

/

 Remember that the verb must agree. with its subject in

number and person.-

 Give the person and number of each of thefollowing verbs,
and Write sentences in which each form shall be used cor-
rectly.

Common forms.—-'-Does, has=ha(ve)s, is, am, are, Was, were.
Old f0rms.—Seest, sawest-, hast=ha(ve)st, Wilt, mayst, mightst, art,

, wast. .

  When a verb has two or more subjects connected by and,
it must agree with them in the plural. A similar rule ap-
plies to the agreement of the pronoun.

Model.—Wrong, because is should agree with its plural subject mis-
takes. The adverb there is often used to introduce a sentence, that the

A TALK ON LANGUAGE.

-2-:-———4.—§—Q 

THE teacher is recommended, before assigning any lesson,
to occupy the time of at least two or three recitations, in
talking with his pupils -about language, always remember-
ing that, in order to secure the interest of his class, he must
allow his pupils to take an active part in the exercise. The
teacher should guide the thought of his class; but, if he

"attempt to do all the talking, he will ﬁnd, when he con-

cludes, that he has been left to do all llze thinking.

We give below a few hints in conducting this talk on
language, but the teacher is not expected to conﬁne himself
to them. He will, of course, be compelled, in some instances,
to resort to various devices in_order to obtain from the pupils
answers equivalent to those here suggested.

 

$E%%@@* 6..

Teacher.—I will pronounce these three sounds very slowly and dis-
tinctly, thus: I2-u-cl. Notice, it is the power, or sound, of the letter,
and not its name, that I give. What did you hear?

Pupil.—I heard three sounds.

T.—Give them. I will write on the board, so that you can see them,
three letters—b-a—cl. Are these letters, taken separately, signs to you

. of anything?

_ P.——-Yes, they are signs to me of _the three sounds that I have just
heard.

T.-What, then, do these letters, taken separately, picture to your
eye?

P.—-They picture the sounds that came to my ear.

SENTENCES AND PARAGRAPHS.

To the Teacher.-—It is very proﬁtable to exercise pupils in combining simple
statements into complex and compound sentences, and in resolving complex and
compound sentences into simple statements. In combining statements, it is an excel-
lent practice for the pupil to contract, expand, transpose, and to substitute different
words. They thus learn to express the same thought in a variety of ways. Any read-
,ing—book or history will furnish good material for such practice. A few examples_ are
given below.

Dc'rection.—C0mbine in as many Ways as possiblepeach of the following groups of
sentences 3"‘ v ‘
Ea;ample.—-This man is to be pitied. He has no friends.
. This man has no friends, and he is to be pitied.
. This man is to be pitied, because he has no friends.
. Because’ this man has no friends, he is to be pitied.
. This man, who has no friends, is to be pitied.
. This man, having no friends, is to be pitied.
. This man, Without friends, is to be pitied.
. This friendless man deserves our pity.

3. The nerves are little threads, or ﬁbers. They extend from the

4. John Gutenberg, published a book. Itwas the ﬁrst book known to
have been printed on a printing-press. He'Was aided by the patronage
of John Faust. He published it-in 1455. He published it in the city of

5. The human body is a machine. A Watch is delicately constructed.
This machine is more delicately constructed. A steam-engine is com-
plicated. This machine is more complicated. A steam-engine is Won-
derful. This machine is more Wonderful.

You see. that short statements closely related in meaning
may be improved by being combined. But young writers
frequently use too many ands and other connectives, and
make their sentences too long. ‘

Sentences and Paragmp/eds. 149

Long sentences should be broken up into short ones when T

the relations of the parts are not clear.

As clauses may be joined to form sentences, so sentences
may be united to make paragraphs.

A paragraph is a sentence or a group of related sentences
developing one point or_ one division of a general subject.

The ﬁrst word of a paragraph should begin a new line, and

should be written a little farther to the right than the ﬁrst

words of other lines.

I)irection.~—Combine the followingstatements into sentences and paragraphs, and
make of them a complete composition :-

'Water is a‘ liquid. It is composed of oxygen and hydrogen. It

covers about three-fourths of the surface of the earth. It takes the ‘

form of ice. It takes the form of snow. It takes the form of vapor.
The air is constantly taking up water from rivers, lakes, oceans, and
from damp ground. Cool air contains moisture. Heated air contains
more moisture. Heated air becomes lighter. It rises. It becomes
cool. The moisture is condensed into ﬁne particles. Clouds are formed.
They ﬂoat across the sky. The little particles unite and form rain-
drops. They sprinkle the dry ﬁelds. At night the grass and ﬂowers
become cool.’ The air is not so cool. The warm air touches the grass
and ﬂowers. It is chilled. It loses a part of its moisture. .. Drops of
dew are formed. Water has many uses. Men and animals drink it.
Trees and plants drink it. They drink it by means of their leaves and
roots. Water is a great puriﬁer. It cleanses our bodies. It washes our
clothes. It washes the dust from the leaves and the ﬂowers. Water is
a great worker. It ﬂoats vessels. It turns the wheels of mills. It is
converted into steam. It is harnessed to mighty engines. It does the
work of thousands of men and horses. I ‘ '

To the Teacher.—Condensed statements of facts, taken from some book not in
the hands of your pupils, may be read to them, and they may be required to expand

-and combine these and group them into paragraphs. V

LETTER—VVRITING.

In Writing a letter there are six things to consider-——the
Heading, the Introduction, the Body of the Letter, the Con-
clusion, the Folding, and the Snpcrscri'1otion.'

THE HEADING.

Parts.—-—The Heading consists of the name of the Place
at which the letter is Written, and the Date. If you write
from a city, give the door-number, the name of the street,
the ‘name of the city, and the name of. the state. If you
are at a hotel or a school, or any other Well-known institu-
tion, its name may take the place of the door-number and
the name of the street. If you write from a village or other

, country place, give your post-office address, the name of the

county, and that ofthe state.

‘The Date consists‘ of the month, the day of the month,’

and the year. .

How 1Vrittcn.--Begin the Heading about an inch and
a. half from the top of the page—on the ﬁrst ruled line of
commercial note——and a little to the left of the middle of the
page. If the Heading is very short, it may stand 011 one
line. If it occupies more than one line, the second line
should begin farther to the right than the ﬁrst, and the third
farther to the right than the second.

The Date stands upon a line by itself if the Heading occu-
pies two or more lines. H H ’ it

~The door-number, the day of month, and‘ the year’ are
Written in ﬁgures, the rest in Words. Each important Word
begins with a capital letter, each item is set off by the comma,
and the Whole closes with a period.

Let2‘er- W r‘z°tz'ng'. I 5 I

ing to these models :-

THE INTRODUCTION.

Parts.—-The Introduction consists of the Address—the
Name, the Title, and the Place of Business or the Residence
of the one addressed-—and the Salutation. Titles of re-
spect and courtesy should appear in the Address. Preﬁx
Mr. to a man’s name; Messrs. to the names of several gen-
tlemen; Miss to the name of a young lady; Mrs. to that of a
married lady. Preﬁx Dr. to the name of a physician, but
never Mr. Dr. ; Rev. (or We Rev.) to the name of a clergy-
man, or Rev. Mr., if you do not know his Christian name;
Rev. Dr., if he is a Doctor of Divinity, or write Rev. before
the name and D.D. after it. A married lady may take the
title of her husband; as, Mrs. Dr.‘ Smith, Mrs. Secretary
Evarts, Mrs. Gen. W. T. Sherman. If two literary or pro-
fessional titles are added to a name, let them stand in the
order in which they were conferred——this is the order of a

‘few common ones: A.Zl[., PIz.D., D.D., LL.D.

~ Salutations vary with the station of the one addressed, or
the Writer’s degree of intimacy with him. Strangers may
be addressed as Sir, Rev. Sir, General, Madam, etc.; ac-
quaintances as Dear Sir, Dear Madam, etc. ; ‘friends as My

152 Graded Lessons in Englis/z."

dear Sir, rlly dear Madam, My dear Jones, etc.; and near
relatives and other dear friends as My dear Wzfe, My dear
Boy, Dearest Ellen, etc. i ’

How Written.—The Address may follow the Heading,
beginning on the next line, or the next but one, and stand-
ing on the left side of the page; or it may stand in corres-

-ponding position after the Body of the Letter and the Con- i

clusion. If the letter is written to a very intimate friend,
the Address may appropriately be placed at the bottom of
the letter ; but in other letters, especially those on ordinary

business, it should be placed at the top and as directed y

above. There should always be a narrow margin on the
left-hand side of the page, and the Address should always
begin on the marginal line. If the Address occupies more
than one line, the initial words of these lines should slope
to the right, as in the Heading.

Begin the Salutation on the marginal line or a little to
the right of it, when the Address occupies three lines; on
the marginal line or farther to the right than the second
line of the Address begins, when this occupies two lines; a

little to the right of the marginal line, when the Address

occupies one line; on the marginal line, when the Address
stands below. '-

Every important word in the Address should begin with
a capital letter. Allthe items of,it should be set off by the
comma, and, as it is an abbreviated sentence, it should close
with a period. Every important word in the Salutation

. should begin with a capital letter, and the whole should be

followed by a comma.

1)1'xrection.—StudyWhat has been said, and write the following introductions ac-

cording to these models :-

end of the Salutation, and on the same line, if the Intro-
duction ‘Consists of. four lines-——in which case the comma
after the Salutation should be followed by a dash ;——other-

‘ wise, on the line below. _ '

Sty/le.——-Be perspicuous. Paragraph and punctuate as in
other kinds of Writing. Spell correctly; Write legibly,
neatly, and With. care. '

Letters of frteezdshtp should be colloquial, natural, and
familiar. Whatever 4i-S interesting to you will be interest-
ing to your friends.

Business letters should be brief, and the sentences should
be short, concise, and to the point.

In formal notes the third person is generally used instead
of the ﬁrst and the second; there is no Introduction, no
Conclusion, no Signature, only the name of the Place and
the Date at the bottom, on the left side of the page.

T.-—Letters then are the signs of what?

P.—Letters are the signs of sounds.

T.-—I will pronounce the same three sounds more rapidly, uniting
them more closely— bud. These sounds, so united, form a spoken
Word. Of What do you think when you hear the Word bud 9

P.—I think of a little round thing that ‘grows to be a leafy branch or
a ﬂower. .

T.-Did you see the thing when you Were thinking of it?

P.-—No.

T.——Then you must have had a picture of it in your mind. We cal.
this mental picture an idea. What called up this idea?

P.—It Was called up by the Word bud, which I heard.

T.—A spoken word then is the sign of What?

P.——A spoken ‘word is the sign of an idea.

T.—I will call up the same idea in another Way. I will write three
letters and unite them thus: bud. What do you see?

P.——I see the Word bud. _ v

T.—If We call the other Word bud a spoken Word, What shall we call
this ?

P.—This is a written word. .

'I'.——If they stand for the same idea, how do they diﬁer?

P.——I see this, and I heard that. .

T.——You will observe that We have called attention to four different
things; viz., the real bud; your mental picture of the bud, which we
have called an idea; and the two words, which We have called signs
of this idea, the one addressed to the ear, and the other to the eye.

serve more closely and express himself more clearly.

of the writer to I the one addressed. In letters of friend-‘

ship you may use Your sincere friend; Yours aﬁ”ection-
ately ; Your loving son or daughter, etc. In business let-
ters, you may use Yours; Yours truly; Truly yours;
Yours respectfully; Very respectfully yours, etc. In oft‘-
cial letters use I have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient
seriwnt; .Very respectfully, your most obedient servant.

The Signature consists of your Christian name and your
.surname. In addressing a stranger write your Christian
name in full. A lady addressing a stranger should preﬁx
her title—Miss or Jl[rs.—-to her own name, enclosing it within
marks of parenthesis, if she prefers.

How Wr-itten.—The Conclusion should begin near the
middle of the ﬁrst line below the Body of the Letter, and
should slope to the right like the Heading and the Address.
Begin each line of it with a capital letter, and punctuate as
in» other writing, following the..whole with a period. The
"Signature should be very plain.

THE FOLDING.

The Folding is as simple matter-when, as now, the en-
velope used is adapted in length to the width of the sheet.

Take the letter as it lies before you, with its ﬁrst page up-

permost, turn up the bottom of it about one-third the
length of the sheet, bring the top down over this, taking
care that the sides are even, and press the parts together.

Lez‘z‘er- VVrz'tz'7zg. ~ I 5 5

Taking the envelope with its back up, insert the letter, put-
ting in ﬁrst the edge last folded.
The form of the envelopemay require the letter to be

folded in the middle. Other conditions may require other

ways of folding. .

THE SUPERSCRIPTION.

1’arts.—-The Superscription is what is written on the
outside of the envelope. It is the same as the Address,
consisting of the Name, the Title, and the full Directions
of the one addressed. T

3 How Written.-—The Superscription should begin near
the middle of the envelope and near the left edge——
the envelope lying with its closed side toward you——and
should occupy three or four lines. These lines should slope
to the right as in the Heading and the Address, the spaces
between the lines should be the same, and the last line should
end near the lower right-hand corner. On the ﬁrst line the
Name and the Title should stand. If the one addressed is
in a city, the door-number and name of the street should be
on the second line, the name of the city on the third, and the
name of the state on the fourth. If he is in the country,
the name of the post-oﬂice should be on the second line, the
name of the county on the third (or by itself near the lower
left-hand corner), and the name of the state on the fourth.
The titles following‘ the name should be separated from it
and. from each other by the comma, and every line should

-end with a comma, except the last, which should be followed

by a period. The lines should be straight, and every part of
the Superscription should be legible. Place the stamp‘ at the
upper ‘right-hand corner. T

To the Teacher.—Have your pupils write complete letters and notes of all kinds.
You can name the persons to whom these are to be addressed. Attend minutely to
all the point.s. Letters of introduction should have the word Introducing (followed
by the name of the one introduced) at the lower left-hand corner of the envelope.

' This letter should not be sealed. The receiver may seal it before handing it to the

' I. A noun or pronoun used as subject or as attribute complement of
a predicate verb, or used independently, is in the nominative case.
II. The attribute complement of a participle or an inﬁnitive is in the
same case (Nom. or Obj.) as the Word to Which it relates.
III. A noun or pronoun used as possessive modiﬁer is in the possess-
ive case. '

IV. A noun or pronoun used as object or objective complement, or as i

the principal Word of a prepositional phrase, is in the objective case.
~\ V. A noun or pronoun used as explanatory modiﬁer is in the same
case as the word explained. ‘ _

. VI. A pronoun agrees with its antecedent in person, number, and
gender. V V

With two or more antecedents connected by and, the pronoun is plural.

With‘ two or more singular antecedents connected by or or nor, the pronoun is-

singular.
VII. A verb agreeswith its subject in person and number.

With two or more subjects’ connected by and, the verb is plural.
With two or more singular subjects connected by or or nor, the verb is singular.

VIII. A participle assumes the action or being, and is used like an.

tion, in sense, of its principal wordto the word modiﬁed.
XIII. Conjunctions connect words, phrases, or clauses.
XIV. Interjections are used independently. '

A Talk on Language. ' II

This question should be passed from one pupil to another till all of these
answers are elicited.

All the written words in all the English books ever made, are formed
of twenty-six letters, representing about forty sounds. These letters
and these sounds make up what is called artiﬁcial language.

Of these twenty-six letters, a, e, i, 0, u, and sometimes W’ and y, are
called vowels, and the remainder are called consonants.

In order that you may understand what kind of sounds the vowels

stand for, and what kinds the consonants represent, I will tell you‘

something about the human voice.

The air breathed out from your lungs beats against two ﬂat muscles,
stretched like strings across the top of the windpipe, and causes them
to vibrate. This vibrating makes sound. Take a thread, putpone end
between your teeth, hold the other in your ﬁngers, draw it tight and
strike it, and you will understand how voice is made.

If the voice thus produced comes out through the mouth held well
open, a class of sounds is formed which we call vowel sounds.

-But, if the voice is held back by your palate, tongue, teeth, or lips,
one kind of consonant sounds is made. If the breath is driven out
without voice, and is held back by these same parts of the mouth, the
other kind of consonant sounds is formed. Ex. of both: 12, d, g; 12, t, k.

The teacher and pupils should practice on these sounds till the three
kinds can easily be distinguished.

You are now prepared to understand what I mean when I say that
the vowels are the letters which stand for the open sounds of the
voice, and that the consonants are the letters which stand for the
sounds made by the obstructed voice and the obstructed breath.

The teacher can here proﬁtably spend a fewminutes in showing how
ideas may be communicated by Natitral Language, the language of
sighs, groans, .gestures of the hands, attitudes of the body, expressions

‘of the face, tones of the voice, etc. He ca11 show that, in conversa-

tion, we sometimes couple this Natural Language of tone and gesture
with our language of words, in order to make a stronger impression.

, Let the pupil be told that, if the passage contain feeling, he should do

the same in Reading and Declaiming.

NOTES FOR TEACHERS.

AGREEMENT.

BEFORE Lesson 8 is assigned, the pupils maybe required to note, in_

Lessons 6 and 7, the subjects that add 3 to denote more than one, and
then to mark the changes that occur in the predicates when the 3 is
dropped from these subjects. In Lesson 8, the predicates may be
changed by adding or dropping 3, and other subjects may be found to
correspond. In Lesson 9, 8 may be dropped from the plural subjects,
and other predicates may be found to agree. ‘

At this stage of the work we should give no formal rules, and should
avoid such technical terms as number, person, tense, etc. The pupils
may be led to discover rules for themselves, and to state them infor-
mally. Exercises and questions may be so directed that the pupils may
draw some such conclusion as the following :—

When ‘a simple form of the verb is used to tell what one thing does, 3

or es is added (unless the subject is I or you).
' Let the pupils see that the s-form of the verb is used only in telling
what one thing does, not what it did ,' as, “ The boy runs,” “ The boy
ram”; and that its subject always stands for the one spoken of; as,
“He runs,” “I run.” _

Before Lesson 12 is assigned, attention may be called to the use of is,
was, and has, in Lesson 11 and elsewhere. For the predicates intro-
duced by these words let the pupils ﬁnd subjects which name more than
one, that they may note the change of is to are, was to were, and has to
have. The forms does and do may also be introduced, and these exercises

' continued till the pupils are led to discover some such rule as the follow-

1ng:—

Is, was, has, and does are used with subjects denoting but one. Are,
were, have, and do are used with subjects denoting more than one.

We suggest that the form of a question and the use of the question
mark be introduced after Lesson 12, and that the pupils be allowed to

I68 _ Graded Lessons in Englis/2.

change the sentences in Lessons 11 and 12 by placing the subject after
the ﬁrst auxiliary. A straight line may be drawn under each subject,
and a waving line under each predicate, thus :—

VVas Napoleon banished?

\./—\J_\.

The sentences given for analysis will furnish material for making in-
terrogative sentences, and for justifying the agreement of verbs.

In connection with Lesson 19 attention may be called to the agreement
of verbs with I and you. Exercises may be given from which the pupils
will draw the following ‘conclusions :— ‘

I can be used with am, was, have, and do. You may mean one or
more than one, but the verb always agrees as if you meant more than
one. -

Exercises may be given requiring the pupils to use‘ such expressions
as “ You were,” ‘‘ They were,” “We were,” “ He doesn’t,” etc., and to
repeat them aloud till the ear is accustomed to the right form.

\/Vhen predicate verbs’ immediately follow their subjects, there is little
danger of errors in agreeme'nt,‘except that was is often used incorrectly
for were, and don’): for doesn’t. The chief object of introducing these
exercises here is to train the pupils’ observation so that they will readily
a_nd naturally note the agreement of the subject and predicate when
these terms are transposed, or are separated by other Words. To de-

termine the correct form of the verb in such cases, let the pupils see

how it sounds when placed immediately after its subject. ’We suggest
exercises like the following :-—

is ' was has does

‘ 1 . 2 , 3 4
are were have do
comes 6 _ goes » thinks writes

come go think V write

After these blanks have been ﬁlled with the verbs above, as indicated
by the numbers, the sentences may be repeated aloud till the correct
form is familiar. A .

Let the pupils see that in (2), Lesson 36, were identiﬁed is asserted of
two things, and that in (3) was anticipated is asserted of one of two
things, but not of both. Let them give other examples of connected
subjects With verbs singular in form, and with verbs plural in form.
The meaning of singular and plural may be explained, and the pupils
may form some such rule as the following :—

With two or more subjects connected by and the verb agrees in' the
plural.

With two or more singular subjects connected by or or nor the verb
agrees in the singular.

The pupils may examine such sentences as——

1. Each word and gesture was suited to the thought ;

2. Every bud, leaf, and blade of grass rejoices after the warm rain ;

3. No dew, no rain, no cloud comes to the relief of the parched earth ;—
and note that each, every, and no show that the things named in the
diﬂerent subjects are taken separately, and that the verbs are therefore
singular.

Such sentences as-

“ In the death of Franklin, a philosopher and statesman was lost to
the world ”— l i
may be given to show that subjects connected by and may name the
same thing, and so take a. verb in the singular.

Particular attention may be called to examples 9-14, that the pupils
may note the eifect of repeating that, the, and a.

Pupils should early learn that rules in grammar should not be followed '

rigidly and blindly, a.s they generally have variations and exceptions.
Caution, however, should be used in presenting exceptions, lest the pupils

become confused.

They may be presented in reviews after the rules

and general principles are well understood. They need not‘ be formally
stated, but may be introduced in the way of observation lessons that
appeal to the judgment rather than to the memory. In this way such
constructions as the following may be introduced :—

1.

c:_cn»;>coz§'.>

Neither he nor I am going.
(Better-—He is not going, nor am I.)

. Neither John nor his sisters were there.
. Action, and not words, is needed.
. Bread and milk is good food.

The committee are unable to agree on their report.

. The committee has made its report.

Other examples may be given till the pupils are led to discover that in
examples like (1)_ and (2) the verb agrees with its nearest subject, and
that the plural subject is usually placed next to the verb; that in (3) the

Notes for Teachers. I 71 H

verb agrees with the affirmative subject, another verb being understood
with the negative subject ; that in (4) “ bread and milk” represents one
article of food; and that in (5) the individuals of the committee are
thought of, while in (6) the committee as a whole is thought of. In (5)
and (6) the agreement of the pronoun may also be noted. Pronouns may be
introduced into many of the preceding exercises and the pupils led to
apply to the agreement of the pronoun with its antecedent what has been
learned of the agreement of the verb with its subject. Let the pupils

determine Why the following connected subjects are arranged in the

proper order :—

1. You and I are invited.

2. Mary and I are invited.

3. You and Mary are invited.

4. You and Mary and I are invited.

WRITING NAMES—CAPITALS AND ABBRE-
VIATlONS.*

Pupils may copy the following list of names, and note all peculiarities
in form:—

Texas, state, river, Red River, city, Albany, New Orleans, Kansas
City, statesman, Thomas J eﬁerson, Thos. J efferson, author, Charles
Dickens, Chas. Dickens, writer, George William Curtis, Geo. Wm.
Curtis,‘ Geo. W. Curtis, poet, John Greenleaf Whittier, John G. Whit-
tier, J. G. VVhittier, gulf, sea, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, lake, Lake

Doctor Valentine Mott, Dr. V. Mott, professor, Prof. Goldwin Smith.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote “ The Song of Hiawatha.”

John Bunyan wrote “ The Pilgrim’s Progress.”

The subject for composition was “ A Day in the Woods.”

We give the following questions to illustrate our method of conduct-
ing an ‘

Observation Lesson.-—Are city and Albany both names? What dif-
ference can, you discover in meaning? What in form? .Which of the

I72 Graded Lessons in English.

names just written are class names? Which are individual names?
Mention an individual name made up of two names; one of three names;
one of four. How many capitals do you ﬁnd in each of the names just
mentioned? Mention seven words that are written without capitals as
class names, and again with capitals as parts of individual names. Men-
tion a word that is shortened, or abbreviated, by omitting all but the
ﬁrst, or initial, letter. Mention an abbreviation containing two letters;
one containing three ; one containing four. What new use of the period
have you discovered in this exercise? What three words in this exercise
are used together as the title of a book? What four as the title of a
poem? What ﬁve as the subject of a school composition? Each of these
groups may be regarded as a kind of individual name. Besides the
ﬁrst word, what words begin with capitals in each of these three groups?
Notice that these are the principal words. i

For another exercise the pupils may copy the following sentences,
noting carefully capitals and punctuation marks :—

. The city of Chicago is on Lake Michigan.
. The. steamer City of Chicago sails from Jersey City.
. The island of Cuba is under Spanish rule.
. The Isle of Man is in the Irish Sea. —
. The Hon.  E. Gladstone is an English statesman.
. The subject for composition was “ The View from my Window.”
. In the evening Aunt Mary entertained my cousin and me with
stories of Uncle Remus. '
8. Miss Evans——afterward Mrs. Lewes—was the author of “The Mill

9. We may call the Supreme Being our Heavenly Father.
10. The Old Testament points to the coming of a Messiah.
11. George I., George II., George III., George IV., and William IV.

name of the place mentioned in (1)? Is Chicago, or City of Chicago the
name of the steamer mentioned in (2)? Is theltown mentioned in (2)

known as Michigan, or Lake Michigan ? What is the name of the
island mentioned in (3) ?—-in (4.)? Is Irish, or Irish.Sea the name of the
body of water mentioned in (4)?

Notice that Spanish, in (3), and English, in (5), are not names, or
nouns. They begin with capitals, because they are derived from the
individual names Spain and England. . _

What names in (7) usually denote relationship? Notice that such
words as uncle, captain, professor, etc.,'do not necessarily begin with
capitals unless preﬁxed to individual names.

What group of words in (6) is treated as an individual name? What ‘

in (8)? Which words of these groups are regarded as the most im-
portant?

In (8) do you ﬁnd a period after Miss?—after Jllrs. .9

Miss is not an abbreviation. '_

What words in (9) and (10) are used as names of the Deity? What is
Old Testament the particular name of?

What do you discover in the names found in (11)?

For other exercises, pupils may be required to bring in lists of geo-
graphical and biographical names, titles of books, etc.

We earnestly recommend the introduction here of letter-writing to
illustrate the use of capitals, abbreviations, and punctuation. (See pp.
150-162.) The writing of headings, introdncti-ons, conclusions, and
superscriptions will give most excellent practice in capitals, etc. The
body of the letter may be directed to the same end. For instance, an
invitation to a friend may be accompanied by a description of the route
to be taken and of the places or objects of interest to be seen on the way.
Or the Writer may mention some of the books he has reafl, with the names
of the characters and of the places mentioned.

.ADJECTIVES—CHOICE AND ARRANGEMENT.

- Words denoting quality form a very large and important group. I Our
knowledge of things about us is a knowledge of their qualities. A writer’s
style is, to a large extent, determined by his use of adjectives. ‘We there-

fore recommend special drill in the choice and the use of adjectives. The

exercises given below may serve as suggestions to the teacher.

I say, Buds swell; "and these two words, in which something, is said of
something else, express that thought, and make what We call a sentence.
In the former expression, bud swelling, it is assumed, or taken for
granted, that buds perform the act; in the latter, theswelling is:as-

We hear of nice mountains, awful pens, horrid ink, splendid pie, ele-

gant beef, lovely cheese, etc.

Pupils may study the meaning of the six adjectives last mentioned,

The italicizedrwords may be omitted. ‘
Pupilsshould be taught to watch for such errors, and to correct them.
Pupils may be required to copy choice selections from literature, and

‘to notelcarefully capitals, punctuation, and the use of adjectives. We

offer the following exercise as a specimen :— -

ation of these several groups? ‘

Notice how the noun crackle crackles as you pronounce it, and how
the adjective sharp makes it penetrate- Notice how strong a picture
is made in the two lines immediately before the last. The adjectives
here used bring out the most prominent qualities of the room, and
these qualities bring along with them into the imagination all the
other qualities. This is what we must try to make our adjectives do.

ARRANGEMENT.

The following exercises are given to show how pupils may discover for

themselves the natural order of words and phrases :—

(a) Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo.

(6) Wi1liam’s sister Mary is an excellent musician.

(0) Everything suddenly appeared so strangely bright.
(d) We saw it distinctly.

/

Notes for Teackers. I 77

(e) We had often been there.
(f) Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo.

Observation Lesson.—-The words and the phrases in the sentences
above stand in their Natural Order. '
From (a) and (b) determine the natural order of the subject, predicate,
and complement. From ((2) determine the natural order of a possessive
modiﬁer, of an explanatory modiﬁer, and of an adjective. From (0), (d),
and (6) determine the several positions of an adverb joined to a verb.

Determine from (0) the position of an adverb modifying an adjective or _

another adverb. Determine from (a) and (f) the natural order of a
phrase. '

Pupils may copy the following, and note the arrangement and the
punctuation, of the phrases :—

(g) This place is endeared to me by many associations. '

(72,) To me, this place is endeared by many associations.

(i) Your answers, with few exceptions, have been correctly given.
(j) He applied for the position, without a recommendation.

Observation Lesson.--Phrases in their natural order follow the words
they modify. When two or more phrases belong to the same word, the
one most closely modifying it stands_ nearest to it.

In the ﬁrst sentence above, to me tells to whom the place is endeared;
by many associations tells how it is endeared to me, and is therefore
placedafter to me. Try the effect of placing to me last. Phrases, like
adjectives, may be of different rank. ,

Phrases are often transposed, or placed out of their natural order.

Notice that to me, in (h) above, is transposed, and thus made em-
phatic, and that it is set off by the comma.

In (6), the phrase is loosely thrown in as if it were not essential, thus
making a break in the sentence. To make this apparent to the eye we

.set the phrase off by the comma.

Place the phrase of (7,) in three other positions, and set it off. When
the phrase is at the beginning or at the end of the sentence, how many
commas do you need to set_.it off? How many, when it is in the middle?

Do you ﬁnd any choice in the four positions of this phrase? After

I 78 Graded Lessons in Englisk.

having been told that your answers were correct, would it be a disap-
pointment to be told that they were not all correct? Is the interest in
a story best kept up by ﬁrst telling the important points and then the
unimportant particulars? What then do you think of placing this
phrase at the end?’ * V

What does the last phrase of (j) modify? Take out the comma, and
then see whether there _can be any doubt as to what the phrase modiﬁes.

In the placing of adverbs and phrases great freedom is often allow-
able, and the determining of their best possible position aﬂords an
almost unlimited opportunity for the exercise of taste and judgment.

Such questions as those on (7,) above may suggest a mode of easy ap- 4

proach to what is usually relegated to the province of rhetoric. Let the
pupils see that phrases may be transposed for various reasons—for em-
phasis, as in (h) above; for the purpose of exciting the reader’s curiosity
and holding his attention till the complete statement is made, as in (73)
above, or in, “ In the dead of night, with a chosen band, under the cover
of a truce, he approached”; for the sake of balancing the sentence by
letting some of the modifying terms precede, and some follow, the prin-
cipal parts,’ as,_ “ In 1837, on the death of William IV., Victoria suc-
ceeded to the throne”; and for other reasons.

Other selections may be made and these exercises continued, the pupils
discussing fully the eifects of all possible changes.

. Pupils may note the transposed words and phrases in the following
sentences, explaining their oﬂice and the eﬂect of the transposition :—

1. Victories, indeed, they were. 6. A mighty man is he.

2. Down came the masts. 7. That gale I well remember.

3. Here stands the man. 8. Behind her rode Lalla Rookh.
4. Doubtful seemed the battle. 9. .Blood-red became the sun.

5. Wide open stood the doors. 10. Louder waxed the applause.

11. Him the Almighty Power hurled headlong.

12. Slowly and sadly we laid him down.

13. Into the valley of death rode the six hundred.

14. So died the great Columbus of the skies.

15. jEneas did, from the ﬂames of Troy, upon his shoulders, the old

Anchises bear. V

16. Such a heart in the breast of my people beats.

17. The great ﬁre up the deep and wide chimney roared.

18. Ease and grace in Writing are, of all the acquisitions made in
school, the most difﬁcult and valuable.

Pupils may read or Write the following sentences in the transposed
order, and explain the effect of the change :--

19. He could not avoid it. 22. He ended his tale here.
20. He would not escape. 23. It stands written so.
21. I must go. 24. She seemed young and sad.

25. I Will make one more effort to save you.
26. My regrets were bitter and unavailing.
27. ..I came into the World helpless.

28. A sincere Word Was never utterly lost.
29. Catiline shall no longer plot her ruin.

ORDER OF INTERROGATIVE SENTENCES.

30. Who Wrote the Declaration of Independence?
31. What states borderon the Gulf of Mexico?
32. Whom did you see?

33. What is poetry?

34. Which course will you choose?

35. Why are the days shorter in Winter?

36. When was America discovered?

37. 8Were you there?

38. Has the North Pole been reached?

Observation Lesson.—When the interrogative Word is subject or a
modiﬁer of it, is the order natural, or transposed? See (30) and (31)
above. .

When the interrogative word is object or attribute complement, or a

modiﬁer of either, What is the order? See (32), (33), and (34).

When.the interrogative word is an adverb, What is" the order? See
(35) and (36).

When there-is no interrogative word, what is the order? See (37)

and (38).

The sentences above Will furnish proﬁt-able review lessons in analysis.

REVIEVV—COMPOSITION.

We suggest that, from two or more paragraphs of some interesting

and instructive article, leading sentences be selected, and that the pupils.

be required to explain the ofﬁce and the punctuation of the easier ad-
jective and adverb phrases, to vary the arrangement in every possible
way, and to discuss the eﬁects of these changes. Then, after ﬁnding the
general subject and the heading for each paragraph, the pupils may
arrange these sentences and work them into a composition, making such
additions as may be suggested.

RESTRICTIVE MOD'IFIERS——PUNCTUATION.

The chief difficulty in the punctuation of the diiferent kinds of modi-
ﬁers is in determining whether, or not they are restrictive. The follow-
ing examples may serve as the basis of. an observation lesson :—

(a) The words golden and omiole are pleasant to the ear.

([2) Words, the signs of ideas, are spoken and written.

(0) Use words that are current.

(d) Words, which are the signs of ideas, are spoken and written;

(49) The country anciently called Gaul is now called France.

(f) France, anciently called Gaul, derived its name from the Franks.
(g) Glass bends easily when it is hot. »

(h) I met him in Paris, when I was last abroad.

The followingexplanations may be drawn from the pupils :— _

In (a) the application of words is limited, or restricted, to the two
words mentioned; in (0) words is restricted to a certain‘kind. In (b)
and (cl) the modiﬁers do not restrict. They apply to all words and sim-
ply add information. In (e) the participial phrase restricts the applica-
tion of country to one particular country; but in (f)‘the phrase describes
without limiting. ‘The omission of the comma in (g) shows that Glass
bends easily ‘is not oﬁered ‘as ’a general statement, but that the action is
restricted to a certain time or condition. When it is hot is essential
to the intended meaning. The punctuation of (h) shows that the speaker

does not wish to make the time of meeting a prominent or essential part-

of what he has to say. The adverb clause simply gives additional infor-

Z\,70tes; for Teachers. 18 I

mation. If (h) were an answer to the question, When did you meet him?
the comma would be omitted. The sense may be varied by the use or
the omission of the comma.

Let the pupils see how incomplete the statements are when the re-
strictive modiﬁers are omitted, and that the other modiﬁers are not so
necessary to the sense. In such expressions as I myself, we boys, the
explanatory words are not restrictive, but they combine closely with the
modiﬁed term. A

ADJECTIVE "CLAUSES.

Adjective clauses allow little change in position. They usually follow
closely the word modiﬁed. Often they may be contracted into adjectives
or into adjective phrases.

Selections from standard writers may be made with special reference
to the studyof adjective clauses. The position, punctuation, and choice
of relatives may be noticed, and, as far as possible, the clauses may be
changed into equivalent adjectives or into phrases.

ADVERB CLAUSES.

An adverb clause may stand before the independent clause, between
its parts, or after it; as, “ When it is hot, glass bends easily; ” “ Glass,
when it is hot, bends easily; ” “ Glass bends easily when it is hot.”
Notice the punctuation of these examples.

Adverb clauses may be contracted in various Ways. Clauses. intro-
duced by the comparatives as and than are usually found in an abbrevi-
ated form; as, “ You are as old as he (is old); ” “ You are older than I
(am old).” Attention may be called to the danger of mistaking here the

nominative for the objective. We suggest making selections for the '

study of adverb clauses.

NOUN CLAUSES.  

Noun clauses may be contracted; as, “ That we should obey is neces-
sary ” = “ Obedience is necessary,” or, _“To obey is necessary; ” “ I can

hardly realize that my friend is gone -” = “ I can hardly realize my

fm'end’s being gone.” By substituting it for the subject clause, this
clause may be placed last and made explanatory; as, “ It is necessary

182 T . Graded Lessons in   Englis/z.

that we should obey.” The object clause is sometimes transposed; as,
“ That my friend is gone, I can hardly realize.” The noun clause may
be made prominent by introducing the independent, clause parenthet-G
ically; as, “ His story, we believe, is exaggerated.”

Notice the punctuation of the clauses above. The noun clause ‘used as
attribute complement is generally set off by the comma. Noun clauses
that are quotations need special treatment.

N‘OUN CLAUSES——QUOTATIONS.

I

We suggest the following observation lesson :-

1. Goldsmith says, “Learn the luxury of doing good.”

2. Goldsmith says that We should learn the luxury of doing good.

3. “ The owlet Atheism, hooting at the glorious sun in heaven, cries
out, ‘ Where is it?’ ” ._ A

4. Coleridge compares atheism to an owlet hooting at the sun, and
asking Where it is. _

5. “To read without reﬂecting,” says Burke, “is like eating Without
digesting.” N

6. May we not ﬁnd “ sermons in stones and good in everything”?

7. There is much meaning in the following quotation: “ Books are
embalmed minds.”

8. We must ask, What are we living for?

9. We must ask what we are living for.

Observation Lesson.——Notice that the writer of (1) has copied into
his sentence (quoted) the exact language of Goldsmith. The two marks
like inverted commas and the two marks like apostrophes, which inclose
this copiedpassage (quotation), are called Quotation Marks.

Name all the diﬂerences between (1) and (2). Is the same thought

expressed in both? Which "quotation would you call direct .9 Which, '

indirect 2’

Notice that the whole of (3) is a quotation, and that this_quotation
contains another quotation inclosed within single marks. Notice the
order of the marks at the end of (3).

Point out the differences between (3) and (4). In which is a question
quoted just as it would be asked? In which is a question merely referred

to ?' Which question would you call direct 9 Which, indirect ? Name
every diiference in the form of these. ’

In which of the above sentences is a quotation interrupted by a paren-
thetical clause? How are the parts marked? I V

Point out a quotation that cannot make complete sense by itself. How
does ‘it differ from the others as to punctuation and the ﬁrst letter?

In (7) a Colon precedes the quotation to show that it is formally
introduced.

In (8) a question is introduced Without quotation marks. Questions
that, like this, are introduced Without being referred to any particular
person or persons, are often Written Without quotation marks. State the
diﬁerences between (8) and (9).

In quoting a question, the interrogation point must stand Within the
quotation marks; but, when a question contains a quotation, this order
is reversed. Point out illustrations above.

Sum up What you have learned. (See rules for capitals, comma, colon,
and quotation marks, pp. 144-147.)

Selections Written in the colloquial style and containing frequent quo-
tations and questions may be taken from reading-books, for examination,
discussion, and copying. Noun phrases may be expanded, and noun
clauses contracted, transposed, etc.

INDEPENDENT CLAUSES.

Frequently independent clauses are contracted by using repeated parts
but once and unitingthe other parts into a compound term, as in Les-
son 67. They are also contracted by omitting such Words_ as may be
readily understood; as, “ Is it true, or not ; ” “ He is a philosopher, /not

a poet.” For punctuation, see rules for the comma and the semicolon,
p. 145. ‘ ’

REVIE-VV—.COMPOSITION.

We recommend that the teacher select some short article containing val-

' uable information and break up each paragraph into short, disconnected

expressions. One paragraph at a time may be put on the board for the
pupils to copy. The general subject may be given, and the pupils may
be required to ﬁnd a proper heading for the paragraph. The diiferent
Ways of connecting the expressions may be discussed in the class. By

contracting, expanding, transposing, and by substituting entirely different
words, a great variety of forms may be had. (The forms found in the
“ Example,” p. 148, and the list of connectives, p. 194, may be helpful.)
The pupils may then combine the different paragraphs into a composi-
tion. For the explanation of paragraph, see p. 149, and for the form of
writing paragraphs, see p. 156, etc.
We give below material for one composition :—

Frog’s spawn found in a pond. At ﬁrst like a mass of jelly. Eggs
can be distinguished.

In a few days curious little ﬁsh are hatched. These “tadpoles” are ,

lively. Swim by means of long tails. Head every large—out of pro-
portion. Appearance of all head and tail. This creature is a true
ﬁsh. It breathes water-air by means of gills. It has a two-chambered
heart. , _ I

Watch it day by day. Two little gills seen. These soon disappear.
Hind legs begin, to grow. Tail gets smaller. Two small arms, or fore-
legs, are seen. Remarkable change going on inside. True lungs for
breathing air have been forming. Another chamber added to the
heart. A

As the gills grow smaller, it ﬁnds difﬁculty in breathing water-air.

‘One ﬁne day it pokes its nose out of the water. Astonished (possibly)

to ﬁnd that it can breathe in the air. A new life has come upon it. No
particular reason for spending all its time in water; crawls out upon
land; sits down upon its haunches; surveys the world. It is no longer
a ﬁsh; has entered upon a higher stage of existence; has become a
frog.

This work of analyzing a composition to ﬁnd the leading thoughts
under which the other thoughts may be grouped is in many ways a
most valuable discipline.

It teaches the pupil to compare, to discriminate, to weigh, to system-
atize, to read intelligently and proﬁtably. ‘

The reading-book will afford excellent practice in ﬁnding heads for
paragraphs. Such work is an essential preparation for the reading-class.

This composition work should serve as a constant review of all that has
been passed over in the text-book. ’

Notes for Teac''hers., ‘ I85 I

ADJECTIVE COMPLEIVIENTS AND ADVERBS.

It is often difﬁcult to distinguish anadjective complement from an
adverb modiﬁer. We offer the following explanation :-

“Mary arrived safe.” As we here Wish to tell the condition of Mary
on her arrival, and not the manner of her arriving, We use safe, not
safely. “ My head feels bad ” (is in a bad condition, as perceived by the
sense of feeling). “ The sun shines bright ” (is bright—-quality,——as per-
ceived by its shining). -

You must determine whether you wish to tell the quality of the thing
named or the manner of the action. A

When the idea of being is prominent in the verb, as in the examples
above, you see that the adjective, and not the adverb, follows.

Let the pupils show that the following adjectives and adverbs are
used correctly :--

. I feel sad.

. I feel deeply. V

. I feel miserable.

. He appeared prompt and willing.

. He appeared promptly and willingly.
. She looks beautiful.

. She sings beautifully.

qcaor»:-cote»

PAST PARTICIPLES AND PREDICATE
VERBS DISTINGUISHED.

When the past tense and the past participle differ in form, they are

often confounded in use; as,

I done it;
I seen it.

Pupils may be required to construct short sentences, oral or written,
using the Past forms found in Lesson 91 as predicates, and the Past Par-
ticiple forms either as modiﬁers or as completing words in compound
verbs. '

I86 I Graded Lessons in Englis/2.

They may be led to some such conclusion as the following :-

The Past is always an asserting, or predicate, word; the Past Parti-
eiple never asserts, but is used as an adjective modiﬁer or as the com-
pleting word of 1 a compound verb; the Present may be used as a predi-
cate or as an inﬁnitive.

‘ Exercises like the following may be copied, and repeated aloud :—

1. Lay down your pen. _ 8. Sit down and rest.

2. Lie down, Rover. 9.‘ I then set it down.

3. I laid down my pen. 10. I sat down and rested.
4. The dog then lay down._ 11. I have set it down.

5. I have laid down my pen. 12. I have sat down.

6. The dog has lain down. ‘ 13. My work was laid aside.
7. Set the pail down. 14. I was lying down.

15. The trap was set by the river.
16. I was sitting by the river.

17. The garment sits well.

18. The hen sits on her eggs.

19. He came in and lay down.

- 20. The Mediterranean lies between Europe and Africa.

Notice that we may speak of laying something or setting something, or
may say that something is laid or is set ,5 but we cannot speak of lying
or sitting something, or of something being lain or sat. , Set, in some of
its meanings, is used Without an object; as, “ The sun set; ” “ He set out
on a journey.” _ ‘

Lay, the present of the ﬁrst verb, and lay, the past of lie, may easily
be distinguished by the difference in meaning and in the time expressed.

.PQSSESSIVE FORMS.

Pupils may be required to copy such formsas the following :-

- The sailor’s story; the farmer’s son; the pony’s mane; the monkey’s
tail; a day’s work; J ames’s book; a cent’s worth; a man’s wages; the
child’s toys; the Woman’s hat; the sailors’ stories; the .farmers"sons;
the, ponies’ manes; the monkeys’ -tails; three" days’ ‘work; ﬁve cents’

, Worth; two .men’s wages; those children’s toys; women’s hats.

Noies for T makers. I8 7

This may be continued till the pupils are ‘able to form some such state-
ment as the following :-

(’s) and (’) are the possessive signs, (’) being used when 3 has been
added to denote more than one, (’s) in other cases.

’ ‘Such expressions as the following may be copied:—

Dombey and Son’s business; J. J. Little & Co.’s printing-house;
William the Conqueror’s reign; Houghton, Mifflin, and Company’s
publications. — '

This may be continued till the pupils learn that, when a group of

words may be treated as a. compound name, the possessiye sign is added
to the last word only.

THE OBJECTIVE COMPLEMENT.

The treatment of the objective complement may be introduced in a

review course, when the class is suﬂiciently mature. The following

explanation may aid some teachers :— _ '

In “It made him sad,” made does not fully express the action per-
formed upon him—-not “made him,” but “made sad (saddened) him.”
Sud helps made to express the action, and ‘also denotes a quality which
as the result of the action belongs to the person represented by the object
him. . ‘ ‘

Whatever completes the predicate and belongs to the object we call
an Objective Complement.

Nouns, inﬁnitives, and participles may also be used in the same way;

as,
“ They made Victoria queen; ’l

“ It made him weep; ”
“ It kept him laughring.”

A ’They . made / queen I Victoria 2E:xplanation.—The line that sepa-

' rates made from queen slants toward

the object‘ complement to show that queen belongs to the object.
A noun or pronoun used as objective complement is in the objective
case. - - ‘
The_ teacher may here explain such constructions as, “ I proved it to

I88   Graded Lessons in Englis/z.

be him,” in which. it is object complement and to be him is objective com-
plement. Him, the attribute complement of be, is in the objective case
because it, the assumed subject of be, is objective. Let the pupils com-
pare “ I proved it to be him ” with “ I proved that it was he; ” “ Whom
did you suppose it to be?” with “ Who did you suppose it was?” etc.

NOUNS AS ADVERB MODIFIERS.

The following uses of nouns and pronouns, not found in the preceding
Lessons, may be introduced in a review course.‘

1. He gave John a book.
2.’ He bought me a book.

I

John and me, as here used, are generally called Indirect Objects. The
“indirect object ” names the one to or for whom something is done. We
treat these words as phrase modiﬁers without the preposition. If we
change the order, the preposition must be supplied; as, “ He gave a book
to John; ” “ He bought a book for me.”

Nouns denoting measure, quantity, weight, time, value, distance, or

direction may be used adverbially, being equivalent ‘ to phrase modiﬁers
without the preposition; as, '

1. We walked four miles an hour.

2. It weighs one pound.

3. It is worth a dollar.

4. The wall is ten feet, six inches high.
5. I went home that way.

The following diagram will illustrate both the “indirect object” and
the “ noun of measure: ”—

RECOMMENDATIONS. ,

From B. 17'. Moore, A.M., Pres. Southern Business University. Atlanta, Ga. -K,

I ﬁnd the work fully adapted for use in business schools as a text book, on 
account of its conciseness ; also to the accountant as a book of reference on points E 1.
of c_Omm.,-rcial law and business forms. It is the most complete and concise work ‘
~. . on the .=::ihiect that I have seen.

of letters and their names. Letters are the signs of what? .What is an
idea? A spoken word is the sign of what? A written word is the sign
of what? How do -they diﬁer? To what four different things did we
call attention in Lesson 1? , ~

How are vowel sounds made? How are the two kinds of consonant
sounds made? What are Vowels? Name them. What are consonants?

What is artiﬁcial language, or language proper? What do you under- ‘

stand by natural language? What is English grammar? ‘ ,
What three kinds of expressions are spoken of in Lessons 3 and 4?
Give examples of each. What is a sentence? , , . '

are almost always abbreviated.

Names of, Women are not generally abbreviated except by using an
initial for one of two Christian names. \

for “J,uly/’, Jno. for ‘fJohn,” da. for “day,” etc.

treated as abbreviations. V

DEFINITION .—The Predicate of a sentence tells What is
thought. . ‘
DEFINI'l‘ION.— The Analysis of a sentence is the separation

of itinto its parts.

Analyze, according to the model, the following sentences.

Model.--Stars twinkle. This is a sentence, because it expresses a
thought. Stars "is the subject, because it names that of which something
is thought; twinkle is the predicate, because it tells what is thought.

1. Plants droop. = 5. Rain falls. _ A ' 9. Boats capsize.
2. Books .help., 6. Time ﬂies. .10. Water ﬂows.
3. Clouds ﬂoat. , s 7. Rowdies ﬁght. 11. Students learn.
_4. Exercise strengthens. 8. Bread nourishes. _ 12. Horses gallop.

To the ’Te'a.cher.—Before the close of this recitation, let the teacher
prepare the pupils for the next Lesson. See “Hints for Oral Instruction”
below. i . ‘

ANALYSIS AND THE DIAGRAM.  

Hints for Oralhlnstruction.--—I will draw on the board a heavy, or
shaded, line, and divide it into two parts, thus: '
I

"We will consider the ﬁrst part as the sign of the subject of a sentence,
and the second part as thesign of the predicate of a sentence.

Now, if I write a word over the ﬁrst line, thus——(doing it)—-you will
understandthat that word is the subject of a sentence. If Iwrite a.
word over the second line, thus-—-you will understand that that word is
the predicate of a sentence.

. -Planets , revolve
. I
The whole classcan see, by looking at the expression, that planets re-

volve is a sentence, that planets is the subject, and that revolve’ is the
predicate. . v

These signs, or illustrations, made up of straight lines, we call Dia-
grams. ‘

When we write the different parts of a sentence over the lines that
stand for those parts, we say that we have diagramed the sentence.

])EFINI'1‘ION.—A Diagram is a picture ofthe oﬁces and rela-
tions of the different parts of a sentence.

Analyze and diagram the following sentences.

1. Waves dash. 9. Nero ﬁddled. 17. Morning dawns.

2. Kings reign. 10. Larks sing’. 18. Showers descended.

3. Fruit ripens. 11. Water ripples. 19. Diamonds sparkle.

4. Stars shine. 12. Lambs frisk. - 20. Alexander conquered.
5. Steel tarnishes. 13. Lions roar. 21. Jupiter thunders.

6. Insects buzz. 14. Tigers growl. 22. Columbus sailed.

'7. Paul preached.’ 15. Breezes sigh. 23. Grrammarians diﬂer.

8. Poets sing. 16. Carthage fell. 24. Cornwallis surrendered.

SENTENCE-BUILDING.

You have now learned to analyze sentences, that is, to
separate them into their parts. You must next learn to put
these parts together, that is, to build sentences.

We will ﬁnd one part, and you must ﬁnd the other and do
the building.

To the Teacher.—Let some of the pupils write their sentences on the
board, while, others are reading theirs. Then let the work on the board be

corrected. .
Correct any expression that does not make good sense, or that asserts some-

thing not strictly true; for the pupil should early be taught to think aeca- A

rately, as well as to write and speak grammatically.
Correct all mistakes in spelling, and in the use of. capital letters and the period.
Call attention to the agreement in form of the predicate with the subject.

,See Notes, p. 167.

Insist on neatness. Collect the papers before the recitation closes.

Semence-Buz'Za’z'ng'. p . I7

CAPITAL LETTER—RULE.-—'.l‘he ﬂrst word of every sentence
must begin with a capital letter. 1 ‘-

PERI0I)—BULE.—A period must be placed after every sen-
tence that simply aﬂirms, denies, or expresses a command.

Construct sentences by supplying a subject to each of the
following predicates. ‘

Ask yourself the question, What swim, sink,ihunt, etc.?

1. ' swim. 7. ———- climb. 13. -: ﬂashes. 19. —— expand.

2. —-— sinks. 8. —— creep. 14. —-— ﬂutters. 20. ——-- jump.

3. —— hunt. 9. ——- run. 15. —— paddle. 21. —-— hop.

4. —-— skate. 10. —— walk. 16. —-— toil. 22. —-— bellow.

5. —-— jingle. 11. —-— snort. 17. —— terriﬁes. 23. —— burns.
6.'———- decay. 12. —— kick. 18. —— rages. 24. evaporates.

This exercise may proﬁtably be extended by requiring the pupils to
supply several subjects to each predicate. . ’

sentence? What is the predicate of a sentence? What is the analysis
of a sentence? A

What is a diagram ? How do you diagram a sentence? What is
the rule in Lesson 8, for capital letters? What rule for the period?

Impromptu Exercise.

Let the pupils “choose sides,” as in a spelling match. Let the
teacher select predicates from Lesson 8, and give them alternately to
the pupils thus arranged. The ﬁrst ‘pupil prefixes to his Word whatever
suitable subjects he can think of, the teacher judging of their ﬁtness
and keeping the count. This pupil now risesand remains standing
until some one else, on his side or the other, shall have preﬁxed to his
Word agreater number of apt subjects. The strife is to see who shall be
standing at the close of the match, and which side shall have furnished.
the greater number of subjects. The exercise may be continued with

Point out the subject and the predicate‘ of each sentence
in Lessons 28, 31, 34. ‘

Look ﬁrst for the word that asserts, and then, by putting
who or what before this predicate, the subject mayeasily be
found. _

To the Teacher.-—Let this exercise be continued till the pupils can readily
point out the subject and the predicate in easy simple sentences. . _

When this can be promptly done, the ﬁrst and most important step in
analysis wﬂl have been taken. ’ '

Most violations of the rules of concord come from a failure to recognize the
relation of subject and predicate when these parts are transposed or are sep-
arated by other Words. Such constructions should therefore receive special
attention. _ See Notes, pp. 168, 169.

Introduce the class to the Parts of Speech before the close of this recita-
tion. See “Hints for Oral Instruction.”

CLASSES OF WORDS.

Hints for Oral Instruction.—By the assistance of the few hints here
given, the ingenious teacher may render this usually dry subject inter-
esting and highly attractive. By questioningthe pupil as to What he has
seen and heard, his interest may be excited and his curiosity awakened.

Suppose thatwe make an imaginary excursion to some pleasant ﬁeld
or grove, Where We may study the habits, the plumage, and the songs of S

the little birds. _

If we attempt to make the acquaintance of every little. feathered
singer We meet, We shall never get to the end of our pleasant task; but
We ﬁnd that some resemble one another in size, shape, color, habits, and
song. These We associate together and call them sparrows.

VVe ﬁnd others differing essentially from the sparrows, but resembling
one another. These We call robins. .

We thus ﬁnd, that-, although We were unable to become acquainted
with each individual bird, they all belong to a few classes, With. which
We may soon become familiar. 1

Nouns. 2 I

It is so with the Words of our language. There" are many thousand
Words, all of Which belong to eight classes.

. These classes of Words are called Parts of Speech. .

We classify birds according to their form, color, etc., but We group
Words into classes, called Parts of Speech, with respect to their use in
the sentence. -

We ﬁnd that many Words are names. These we put in one class and
call them Nouns.

- Each pupil may give the name of something in the room; the name
of a distinguished person; a name that may be applied to a. class of per-
sons; the name of an animal; the name of a place; the name of a river;
the name of a mountain; the name of something which We cannot see or
touch, but of which We can think; as, beauty, mind.

Remind the pupils frequently that these names are all nouns.

. NOU N S. _

DEFINITION.——A Noun is the name of anything.

Write in columns, headed nouns, the names of domestic
animals, of garden vegetables, of ﬂowers, of trees, of articles
sold in a. dry goods store, and of things that cannot be seen
or touched; as, virtue, time, life.

Write and arrange, according to the following model, the
names of things that can float, fly, walk, work, sit, or sing.

Nouns. '
Cork

Clouds

Model.—Wood ﬂoats or ﬂoat.

Ships
. Boys

Such expressions as Cor/c ﬂoats are sentences, and the
nouns cork, shzgo, etc., are the subjects. p You Will ﬁnd .that
every subject is a noun or some word or words used for a
noun.

Be prepared to analyze and parse the sentences which you

have made-—?nam‘z'ng the class to which a word belongs is the
ﬁrst step in parsing.

Model for Ana1ysis.—This is a sentence, because -———; cork is the
subject_,because —; floats is the predicate, because ——.

Parsing.—-Cork is a noun, because it is the name of a thing—-the bark
of a tree. ' '

 $§%%@$ i5.

Select and Write all the nouns in the sentences given in
Lessons 28, 31, 34.
Tell Why they are nouns. _
In writing the nouns, observe the following rule.

 

CAPITAL LETTER—RULE.———Every proper or individual name
must begin with a capital letter.

To the Teacher.—See Notes, pp. 171-173.

REVIEW QUESTIONS.

What is treated of in Lesson 11? With respect to What, did we
classify Words in Lesson 14? What are such classes called? Can you
niustrate this classiﬁcation? What are all names? What is a noun?

What is the ﬁrst step in parsing? What is the rule given in Lesson 15?

VERBS.

Hints for Oral Instruction.—We propose to introduce you now to
another class of Words. (The teacher may here refer to the talk about
birds.) i ‘

You have learnedthat one very large class ofwords consists of names

of things. There is another very important "class of Words used to tell i

What "these things do, or used to express their existence.

Verbs. 23

When I say, Plants grow, is grow the name of anything? P. No.
‘I'.——What does it do? P.—It tells What plants do. It expresses action.
T.—»-—When I say, God is, What does is express? P.—It expresses exist-
ence, or being. » ~
T.—When I say, George sleeps, sleeps expresses being and something
more; it tells the condition, or state, in which George is, or exists, that
is, it expresses stateof being.
All the words that assert action, being, or state of being, We call Verbs.
‘Let the teacher Write nouns on the board, and require the pupils to
give all the Words of which they can think, telling What the things
named can do. They may be arranged thus :—

Noun. Verbs.
grow,
droop, Each pupil may give a verb that expresses an
Plants < decay, action of the body; as, weep, sing; an action of the
| ﬂourish, mind; as, study, love; one that expresses being or
L revive. state of being.

 

])EFINITION.—A Verb is a word that asserts action, being, or r

state of being.

The oﬂice of the verb in all its forms, except two (the par- ,

ticiple and the inﬁnitive, see Lessons 48 and 49), is -to assert.
This it does Whether the sentence affirms, denies, or asks a
question. ‘ I ‘

To the Tea cher.-—In the exercises of this and the next two Lessons, let the
pupils note the agreement of the verb with its subject. See Notes, pp. 167-169.

Supply, to each of the following nouns, as many appropri-
ate verbs as you" can think of.
Let some express being or state of being.

Parrots —'——.
Ministers —.

Water ——. Wind —-——. Pens
Vines —-—. Farmers  c Trees

Hints for Oral Instruction.—We propose to introduce you now to the
third part of speech. T.—If I should ask who Whispered, and some-
boy should promptly confess, What would he say?" P.—-I Whispered.
T.—Would he mention his own name? P.—No. T.--What word
would he use instead? P.—I. ' g

T.—Suppose that I had spoken" to that boy and had accused him of
Whispering, how should I have addressed him Without mentioning his
name? P.—You Whispered. T.—_What Word would be used instead
of the name of theboy to whom I spoke? P.—— You. .

T.—Suppose that, Without using his name, I had told you what he
did, What should I have said? P.-7-I:I'e Whispered. T.-What Word
would have been used instead of the name of the boy of Whom I spoke? '
P.—He. . g .

(Repeat these questions and suppose the pupil to be a girl.)

T.—If I should tell that boy to close his book, when his book was _

already closed, What would he say Without mentioning the word book?
P.——Izf is closed. W ~

T.—If I should accuse several of you of whispering, and one shlould

. speak for himself and for the others whispering with him, What would

he say? We Whispered. ‘ , ‘
T.—Suppose that a boy should inform me that all of the boys on that
seat had Whispered_, What Would he say? P.—They Whispered.
I, you, he, she, it, we, and they are not names, but they are used in-

stead of names. We call such words Pronouns.

Analysis and Parsing.
Mode1.— You will be rewarded.

Oral Analysis.——This is a sentence, because —————;’ you is the subject,
because —; will be rewarded is the predicate, because —.

Parsing.—— You is a pronoun, because it stands for the name of the
person spoken to; will be rewarded is a verb, because .

1. We think. 4. I study. 7. He Was punished."
2. She prattles. 5. You have been seen. 8. They are conquered.
3. We have recited. 6. It has been decided. 9. Thou art adored.

 

Compose nine similar sentences, using a pronoun for the
subject of each, and diagram them.
To the Teacher. —-Call special attention to the agreement of the verb with
I and you. See Notes, p. 168.

Before this recitation closes, explain “ Modiﬁed Subject.” See “Hints for

MODIFIED’ SUBJECT.

Hints for Oral Instruction. —-The Subject and the Predicate may be
considered as the foundation on which every sentence is built. N o sen-
tence can be constructed without them.

You have already learned that these parts alone, sometimes make a
complete structure; but we are about to show you that they are often
used as the foundation of a structure, which! is completed by adding
other parts. .

I hold in my hand several pieces of metal, With letters and other
characters stamped on them. What do you say I ‘have in my hand?
P.—Money. T.-——Yes. What other Word can you use? P.——0'oz'u.
T.—-Yes. I will Write on the board this sentence: 0o'tu"'ts stamped. ‘

The subject coin is a general name for all such piecesof metal. I

A nalysis. . ' 2 7

will Write the Word the before this sentence. The coin is stamped. I
have now made an assertion about one particular coin, so the meaning
of the subject is limited by joining the Word the.

I can again limit the meaning of the subject by putting_the Word a -

before it. The assertion is now about one coin, but no particular one.
I point to the piece near me and say, This coin is stamped. I point to
the one farther from me and say, That coin is stamped.

When Words are joined to the subject to limit its-meaning, We say that
the subject is modiﬁed. ,

The words the, a, this, and that modify the subject by limiting the
Word to one coin, or to one particular coin.

We can modify the subject by joining some word which Will tell What —

kind of coin is meant. ‘

Here is a coin dated 18———. We can say, The new coin is stamped.
Here the Word new tells What kind of coin is meant. What other Words
can I use to modify coin .9‘ P.—Beautiful, bright,’ new, round, silver.
T.—These Words beautiful, bright, new, round, and silver modify the
subject by telling the qualities of the coin.

We call the Words the, beautiful, etc., Modiﬁers.

])EFINI'.l‘ION.——A Modiﬁer is a word or group of words joined
to some part of the sentence to qualify or limit the meaning.

The Subject With its Modiﬁers is called the Modiﬁed
Subject.

ANALYSIS.

Analyze and diagram the following sentences.

Explanation of the Diagram.-Examine the diagram carefully, and
see What it pictures to you. _ -

28 Graded Lessons in E nglish.

 

The two lines shaded alike and placed uppermost stand for the subject
and the predicate, and show you that these are of the same rank, and
are the principal parts of the sentence. ‘

The lighter lines, placed under and joined to the subject line, stand
for the modiﬁers, the less important parts, and show you what is
modiﬁed. ‘ ' -

Oral Analysis.——This is a sentence, because —-—; days is the subject,
because ; have come is the predicate, because ————; The, genial, and

 

‘summer are modiﬁers of the subject, because they are words joined to

the subject to modify its meaning. The genial summer days is the
modiﬁed subject.

ADJECTIVES.

Hints for Oral Instruction.—You are now prepared to consider the

ADVERBS.

Hints for Oral Instructioin.—-—You have learned, in the preceding
Lessons, that the meaning of the predicate may be limited by modiﬁers,

and that one modiﬁer may be joined to another. Words usedjito modify

the predicate of a sentence and those used to modify modifiers belong
to one class, or one part of speech, and are called Adverbs. L

T.——She decided too ‘ hasﬁlg/., What word tells how she decided?
P.—-Hastdly. T.—What Word tells "how hastilyija P.—-T00.‘ T.-
What then are the Words too and hastily‘? ' P.——Adverbs.  .

telling how much? P.-—T00. T.—What part of speech is ’ much ?.

P.-—-An adjective. T.—What then is too 9 P.-—-An adverb. ' t L a
T.—Why is too in the ﬁrst sentence an adverb? Why is too in th

. second sentence an adverb? ‘Why is hastily/_ an adverb?
Let the teacher use the following and similar examples, and con-j

tinue the questions. He thinks so; So much time has been wasted.

Let the teacher give verbs,-adjectives, and adverbs, and require the

pupils to modify themby appropriate adverbs.

ERRORS FOR CORRECTION,

To the 'l‘eacher.—We here suggest additional work in composition, with
particular reference to the choice and position of adjectives. See Notes, pp.
175,176.    

Caution.-When two or more adjectives are used with a
noun, care must be taken in their arrangement. If there is
any difference in their relative importance, place nearest the
noun the one,,that is most intimately connected with it. r-

' To_the Teacher.—We have in mind here those numerous cases where
one adjective modiﬁes the noun, and the second modiﬁes the noun as limited

' by the ﬁrst. Alljépe apples are picked. Here ripe modiﬁes apples, but all mod-

iﬁes apples limitedrgby  Not all apples are picked, butgonly all that are ripe.

PHRASES INTRODUCED BY PREPOSITIONS.

Hints for Oral Instruction.—-In the preceding Lessons, you have
, learned that several words may be grouped. together and used as one

modiﬁer. In the examples given, the principal word is joined directly

to the subject or to the predicate, and this Word is modiﬁed by another '

l word. In this Lesson also groups of words are used as modiﬁers, but.

these words are not united with one another, or with the word which
the group modiﬁes, just as they are in the preceding Lessons.
I will write on the board this sentence: De Soto marched into Florida.

T.—‘-What tells where De Soto marched? P.——Into Florida. T.—v

What is the principal word of the group? P.——Florida. T.—Is Florida
joined directly to the predicate, as rapidly was in Lesson 25? P.-——No.

T.—What little word comes in to unite the modiﬁer to marched ? P.'—-- A

Into. T.—Does Florida alone, tell where he marched ?_ P.——No. T.—-
Does into alone, tell where he marched? P.——No.
T.——These groups of related words are called Phrases. Let the teacher

draw on the board the diagram of the sentence above.

Phrases of the form illustrated in this diagram are the most com-

" men, and they perform a very important function in our language.

Let the teacher frequently call attention to the fact that all the.,word's
of a phrase are taken together to perform one distinct oﬁice.

A phrase modifying the subject is equivalent to an adjective, and, ‘I

frequently, may be changed into one. The dew of the morning has

- passed away. What word may be used for the phrase of the morning 

P.—-Morning. T.—-Yes. The morning dew has passed away. ,
A phrase modifying the predicate is equivalent to an adverb, and,

L frequently, may be changed into one. We will go to that place. What

word may be used for the phrase, to that place .9 P.——There. T.—-Yes.
We will go there. ~ g s -

PREPOSITIONS.

I-Iin-ts for Oral Instruction.——In the preceding Lessons, the little
words that were placed before nouns, thus forming phrases, belong to
a class of words called Prepositions.‘ You noticed that these words,
which you have now learned to call prepositions, served to introduce

phrases. The preposition shows the relation of the idea expressed by.

the principal word of the phrase to that of the word which the phrase

~modiﬁes. It serves also to. connect these words.

In the sentence, The squirrel ran up a tree, what word shows the
relation of the act of running, to the tree? Ans. Up.

Other words may beused to express different relations. Repeat, nine ‘

times, the sentence above given, supplying, in the place of up, each of

the following prepositions: Around, behind, down, into, over, through,

to, under, from. ‘ I T _
Let this exercise" be continued, using such sentences as The man went

into the house; The ship sailed toward the bay.

exercise.) _ ' _ A e

COMPLEMENTS-

Hints for Oral Instruction.—When We say, The sun gives, We express
no complete thought. The subject sun is complete, but the predicate
gives does not make a complete assertion. When We say, The sun gives
light, We do utter a complete thought. The predicate gives is completed
by the Word light. Whatever ﬁlls out, or completes, We call a. Comple-
ment. We Will therefore call light the complement of the predicate.

,»;.v..v

As light completes the predicate by naming the thing acted upon, we ‘

call it the Object Complement.
Expressions like. the following may be Written on the board, and by
a series of questions the pupils may be made to dwell upon these facts

_till they are thoroughly understood.

The officer arrested ——; the boy found —;
Charles saw ——-; coopers make --—-.

Besides these verbs requiring object complements, there are others
that do not make complete sense Without the aid of a complement of
another kind.

Complements. 5 3

A complete predicate does the asserting and expresses What is asserted.
In the sentence, Armies march, march is a complete predicate, for it does
the asserting and expresses what is asserted; viz., marching. In the
phrase, armies marching, marching expresses the same act as that de-
noted by march, but it asserts nothing. In the sentence, Chalk is white,
is does the asserting, but it does not express What is asserted. We do
not wish to assert merely that chalk is or exists.‘ What We wish to

‘ assert of chalk, is the quality expressed by the adjective white. As

white expresses a "quality or attribute, We may call it an Attribute Com-
plement. . "
Using expressions like the following, let the facts given above be

- drawn from the class by means of questions.

Grass growing ; grass grows; green grass; grass is green.

 

I)EFINI’l‘ION.—The Object Complement of a sentence com-
pletes the predicate, and names that which receives the act.

DEFINITION .-—'l‘he Attribute Complement ‘of a sentence
completes the predicate and belongs to the subject.

The complement with all its modiﬁers is called the Modi-
fied Complement. . 4 ‘

Oral Analysis.—Falton and invented, as before. Steamboat is the

Hints for Oral Instruction.—-You have learned, in the preceding

ing, or it may be asserted; as, Peter turned. In the expression, Peter,
turning, said, what word expresses an action as assumed, and which

’ asserts an action? . Each pupil may give an example of an action asserted

and of an action assumed; as, Corn grows, corn growing ; geese gabble ,-

thus: growing corn, gabbling geese, they tell simply the kind of corn and
the kind of geese, and are therefore adjectives. ‘ -

When the or some other adjective is placed before these Words, and a
preposition after them, thus: The growing of the earn, the gabbling of
the geese, they are simply the names of actions, and are therefore nouns.

Let jeach pupil give an example of a verb asserting an action, and

Explanation of the Diagram.—In this diagram, the line standing
for the principal Word of the participial phrase is broken; one part
slants, and the other is horizontal. This shows that the participle
crushed‘ is used like an adjective to modify Truth, and yet retains the
nature of a verb, expressing an action received by truth.

Oral Ana1ysis.—This is a sentence, because —; Truth is the sub-
ject, because -——-; will rise is the predicate, because —--; the phrase, .
,.;erushecl to earth, is a modiﬁer of the Subj., because —; crushed in-

troduces the phrase and is the principal Word in it; the phrase to earth is
a modiﬁer of crushed ; to introduces it, and earth is the principal Word
in it; again is a modiﬁer of the Pred., because Truth crushed to
earth is the modiﬁed subject, will rise again is the modiﬁedpredicate.

Parsing.——0rushecl is the form of the verb- called participle, because
the action expressed by it is merely assumed.

THE INFINITIVE PHRASE.

Hints for Oral Instruction.—There is another ‘form of the verb
which, like the participle, cannot be the predicate of a sentence, for it
cannotiassert; as, She went out to see a friend; To lie is a disgrace. As
this form of the verb expresses the action, being, or state in a “general
manner, without limiting it directly to a subject, it is called an Inﬁni-

' tive, which means without limit. The inﬁnitive generally follows to ;
as, to walk, to sleep.

Let each pupil give an inﬁnitive.

be employed in several ways.

COMPLEX SENTENCES.

THE ADJECTIVE CLAUSE.

‘ Hints for Oral Instruction.—A‘Word-modiﬁer may sometimes be ex-

“panded into a phrase or into an expression that asserts. .

T.—A wise man will be honored. Expand wise into a phrase, and
give me the sentence. P.—A man of wisdom will be honored. T.——
Expand wise into an expression that asserts, join this to "man, as a mod-
iﬁer, and then give me the entire sentence. P.—A man who is wise
wil1’be honored.

T.—g—You see that the same quality may be expressed in three Ways-
A wise man, A man of wisdom, A man who is wise. A

Let the pupils give similar examples.

T.—In the sentence, A man who is wise will be honored, the Word who =
stands for What? P.——For the noun man. T.—-—Then What part of speech

is it? P.—A pronoun.

,T.——-Put the noun man in the place of the pronoun who, and then
give me the sentence. P.—A man, man is wise, will be honored.

T.-—I will repeat your sentence, changing the order of the Words-A
man will be honored. ‘Man is wise. Is the last sentence now joined to
the first as a. modiﬁer, or_ are they two separate sentences? P.-—They
are two separate sentences. ~

T.—Then you see that thepronoun who not only stands for the noun
man, but it connects the modifying expression, who is wise, to man, the
subject of _the sentence, A man will be honored, and thus there is formed
what We call a Complex Sentence.
A man will be honored is the Independent Clause; who is wise is the

importance of the ‘two clauses. You will see ‘that the pronoun who is

forms the oﬂzlce of a conjunction also, and this oﬂice is expressed in the
diagram by a dotted line. As all modiﬁers are joined by slanting lines .
to the Words they modify, you learn from this diagram that who is wise
is a modiﬁer of man. ~ -

Oral Analysis.——This is a complex sentence, because it consists of an
independent clause and a dependent clause. A ma/n will be honored‘ is
the independent clause ; who is wise is the dependent clause. Man is
the subject of the independent clause; will be honored is the predicate.
The Word A and the clause, who is wise, are modiﬁers of the subject.
A points out man, and who is wise tells the kind of man. A man who
is wise is theVmodiﬁed subject; the predicate is unmodiﬁed. Who is
the subject of the dependent clause, is is the predicate,‘and wise is the

attribute complement. Wlio connects the two clauses.

1. He that runs may read.
2. Man is the only animal that laughsand weeps.

Oral Analysis.—-This is a complex sentence, because ; We started
_is the independent clause, and when the sun rose is the dependent clause.
We is the subject of the independent clause, and started is the predicate.
The clause, when the sun rose, is a modiﬁer of the predicate, because ill
tells when we started. Started when the sun rose is the modiﬁed predicate.
« Sun is the subject of the dependent clause, and rose is the predicate,
and the is a modiﬁer of sun; the sun is the modiﬁed subject. When

modiﬁes rose and started, and connects the clause-modiﬁer. to the pred—”

icate started.

fan-“ACE.

ON a single point, at least, all English grammarians are united.
They hold that, by the study of grammar, the pupil should acquire
the art of using the English language with propriety. A study of the
science that does not issue in this, all agree, fails of its proper end.

They diverge only when they set forth the means to this end. The
greater number_ bewilder the pupil with prolix discussions, and vex
him with obscure deﬁnitions and numberless rules with their suici-
dal exceptions. V They load his memory With technicalities and appall
him With authorities and dull his understanding With endless routine
parsing and analysis. With them, grammar is a science, or it is noth-
ing. This the pupil ﬁnds to his cost ; but it scarcely dawns upon him
that grammar is intended to aid him in communicating his thoughts by
tongue and by pen. I

In reaction from this extreme, many have sprung to the other. To

these, grammar hardly seems to be a science at all; there are few

‘principles in it that challenge serious attention; it demands no deﬁni-

tions that even approach exactness ; everything may be loose . in treat-
ment and in statement, if only grammar may be made easy, “ practi-

cal,”. and “popular.”  This reaction is just now at its ﬂood. There
