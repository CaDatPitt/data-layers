average businessman will ﬁnd the full outlines completely adequate,
and his mind should not be -burdened with shortcuts for many words
.and phrases.

If, however, we are training our students for the expert speeds, the
inclusion of a judicious selection of shortcuts is justiﬁed. But even
there we must be careful that (1) the number is kept to a minimum;
and (2) the shortcuts selected appear with suﬁicient frequency, so that
the student will have an opportunity to make them a part of his auto-
matic writing vocabulary through constant repetition.

In preparing the material for Expert S/zortfzrma.’ Speed Course, the
authors felt that the maximum number of shortcuts and shortcut prin-
-ciples necessary or desirable to bring the student up to approximately
160 words a minute was about one hundred—and that is the number
that has been included (not counting derivatives).

These one hundred shortcuts and shortcut principles are introduced
in the first twenty—one assignments at the rate of about ﬁve to _an
assignment. They are selected from the practice material in that assign-
ment. Each shortcut, or its derivative, appears in a minimum of ﬁfteen
different assignments. Many of the shortcuts, of course, occur in a
greater number of assignments.

The assignments are graded in accordance with the shortcuts that
have been introduced. Assignment 1 contains only the shortcuts intro-
duced in that assignment—’all other shortcuts have been eliminated;
Assignment 2 contains only the shortcuts introduced in Assignments
1 and 2—all others have been eliminated. This grading avoids the
undesirable learning situation in which the student writes a word in
full in one assignment and then is introduced to a shortcut for it in
the next.

Every eleventh assignment is a “review” assignment in which all
the shortcuts or derivatives of the shortcuts usedup to that assignment
are used. In Assignment 11, all the shortcuts studied in Assignments 1
through 10 are used intensively; in Assignments 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, and
77, the entire one hundred shortcuts, or their derivatives, are used.
These review. assignments should be dictated again and again until the
students are able to write them" at speeds considerably above their
normal writing rate.

indeﬁnitely” .and as long as the enemy pleases; and the longer it con-
tinues, the more rapid will be our approach, ﬁrst toward that parity
and then into that superiority” in the air upon which, in a large
measure, the decision of the war depends.

The gratitude of every home in our island, in our empire, and”
indeed throughout the world, except in the abodes of the wicked, goes
out to the British airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their
constant challenge and mortal” danger, are turning the tide of world
war by their‘ prowess and by their devotion. Never in the ﬁeld of
human conﬂict was so much owed by so many to so few.

A1119 hearts go out to the ﬁghter pilots whose brilliant actions we
see with our own eyes day after day; but we must never forget that all
the time, night after night, month after month,2° our bomber squad-
rons travel far into Germany; ﬁnd their targets in the darkness by
the highest navigational skill; aim their attacks—-often‘ under the
heaviest” ﬁre, often with heavy loss—with deliberate, careful discrim-
ination; and inflict shattering blows upon the whole of the technical
and war-making structure” of the Nazi power.

On no part of the Royal Air Force does the weight of the war fall
more heavily than on the daylight bombers, who will play an inval-
uable23 part in the case of invasion and whose unﬂinching zeal it has
been necessary in the meanwhile, on numerous occasions, to restrain.

We are able to verify“ the results of bombing military targets in
Germany, not only by reports. which reach us through many sources,
but also by photographs. *

I have no25 hesitation in saying that this process of bombing the

military industries and communications of Germany, and the air bases
and storage depots” from which We are attacked——‘and which will
continue upon an ez/er—z'ncrea:z'ng scale until the end of the war, and
may in another year attain dimensions hitherto” undreamed of——
affords one, at least, of the surest, if not the shortest, of all the roads
to victory. (829 standard words) (Concluded in Par. I04)

103; High-Speed Ta.ke No. 21-—-Agriculture

Mr. Chairman, there is so much to be said on bot/2 sides of this bill
that it isdifﬁcult to be brief. 1 hope Members will permit me to make
a brief statement without1 interruption. Before the debate shall have
been concluded, some of us on the committee favoring the bill will
undertake to answer any questions that may2 be propounded and to
supply such information as may be desired.

The cotton-control program in the United States was intended to
benefit and improve?’ the pure/zasing power of the farmers of the Na-
tion and the people who produce cotton. That vital purpose should be
borne in mind in the consideration of this4 bill.

Approximately 100,000,000 bales of cotton have been grown since”

the beginning of the cotton program. Something like 90,000,000 bales
have been marketed5 by the farmers independently of the Government-
loan programs. When the program was inaugurated, the price of cot-
ton was running around 5 cents a pound. The“ cotton that has been
marketed has averaged something like 10 cents a pound, which means
that this program has probably resulted in an additional income for
the7 cotton farmers during this period amounting to something like
half a billion dollars. .

As contrasted with this result for the producer: of the Nation, it is8
shown in the record before the committee that the losses of the Corpo-
ration on cotton do not exceed $25 million. As a matter of fact there
have9 been only two appropriations setting up thecapital of the Cor-
poration which totaled SSZOO million, and they have made a profit of”
$43 million. The book value of the cotton owned by the Corporation

is $364 million; and there is outstanding $238 million” in producer

loans, making a total book value of about $600 million.

When cotton-is marketed from time to time by the farmer, new
take: it to town to the local warehouse. In many instances such ware-
houses are farmer—owned. The local warehouseman is the friend and
counselor of the farmer. He” lives in the same community as the
farmer with whom he deals. There is a relationship there that should
not be disturbed unless there exists some impelling reason for“ such
action.

What happened? Cotton was being stored at rates sometimes as

30’s]‘ 93

high as 50 cents a bale a month. When the cotton program was in-
augurated, warehousemen foundwsthemselves having storage of large.
amounts of cotton. The program enacted after the last election enabled
the farmers to hold their cotton instead of dumping it in” seasonal
periods at whatever price might be offered, as had been the custom
theretofore. So the, warehouses with large stocks of storage cotton
were able to make” larger proﬁts on their businesses. It naturally
followed that storage charges could be and were reduced more than
50 per cent.

As storage stocks went up, storage charges” came down from 50
cents to 25 cents and then to an all—time low of 15 cents, including in-

 surance. If you will read the hearings, you will ﬁnd that the oﬁ‘icials19

themselves told the Committee that the accumulation of this cotton
helped the warehouseman serving the farmers to reduce the rates on
cotton stored by the farmers.”

WINSTON CHURCHILL (Concluded)

Even if the Nazi legions stood on the Black Sea, or indeed upon
the Caspian——even if Hitler was at the gates of India—it would proﬁt
him nothing1 if at the same time the entire economic and scientiﬁc
apparatus of German war power lay shattered and pulverized at
home. . . .

A good many people2 have written to me to ask me to make on
this occasion a fuller statement of our war aims and of the kind of

peace we wish to make than is contained in the very?’ considerable

declaration which was made early in the autumn. . . .

I do not think it would be wise at this moment, while the battle
rages and the war is still in4 its earlier stage, to embark upon.elaborate
speculation about the future shape which should be given to Europe
or the new securities which must be5 arranged to spare mankind the
miseries of a third world war.

The ground is not new. It has been frequently traversed and ex-
plored, and many ideas are held in common6 by all good men and all
free men. But before we can undertake the task of rebuilding, we have

94 [30’s

not only to be convinced ourselves but to convince all other countries7
that the Nazi tyranny is going to be ﬁnally broken.

The right to guide the course of world history is the noblest prize
of victory. We are still toilings up the hill. We have not yet breasted
the crest line. We cannot survey the landscape or even imagine what
its condition will be in that longed-for hour. _

The task which lies9 before us immediately is at once more simple
and more stern. I hope, indeed, I pray, that We shall not be found
unworthy of our victory if after toil and” tribulation" it is granted to
us. For the rest we have to gain the victory. i

There is, however, one direction in which we can see a little more
clearly ahead.“ We have to think not only for ourselves but for the
lasting security of the cause and principles for which we are ﬁghting.

Some months ago we came to the” conclusion that the interest: of
the United States .and of the Empire both required that the United
States should have facilities for the naval and air defense of the13
Western Hemisphere against the attack of a Nazi power which might
have acquired temporary but lengthy control of a part of Western
Europe and its resources.“

We have therefore decided, spontaneously and Without being asked
or offered any inducement, to inform the Government of the United
Strztesm that we should be glad to place such defense facilities at their
disposal by leasing suitable sites in our transatlantic possessions for
their greater security” against the unmeasured dangers of the future.

The principle of association of interests for common purposes be-
tween Great Britain and the United” States had developed even
before the war in the various agreements reached about certain small
islands in the Paciﬁc Ocean which have become important” as air-
fueling points. In_all this line of thought we found ourselves in very
close harmony.

Presently we learned that anxiety was also felt in the United States”
about the air and naval defense of their Atlantic seaboard, and the
President has made it clear that he would like to discuss with us and
with the Dominion of Canada” and with Newfoundland the develop-

ment of American naval and air facilities in Newfoundland and in_

the West Indies.
There is of course no question 0

30’s] 95

£21 any transference of sovereignty

or of any action being taken against the wishes of the various colonies A

concerned; but for our part His Majesty’s22 Government isentirely
willing to accord defense facilities to the United States on a ninety-
nine—year leasehold basis, and we feel sure that our interests23 no less
than theirs and the interests of the colonies themselves and of Canada
and Newfoundland will be served thereby.

Undoubtedly this process means that these two24 great organiza-
tions of the English—speaking democracies, the Empire and the United
States, will have to be somewhat mixed up together in some of their
aﬁ'airs25 for mutual and general advantage. A

For my own part, looking out upon the future, I do not View the
process with any misgivings. No one can stop it. Like” the Missis-
sippi, it just keeps rolling along. Let it roll. Let it roll on in full ﬂood,
inexorable, irresistible, to broader lands .and better days. (809 standard

106. High-Speed Take No. 22—Review
(This take reviews all the shortcuts introduced in Assignments 1-21.)

Mr. S pealier, whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, whether
you come from a community devoted to agriculture or whether you
come from1 a community whose prosperity and purchasing power are
provided by industrial production, you undoubtedly receive a constant
stream of letters2 from your constituents. '

Sometimes a taxpayer writes to you for an explanation of some
amendment to an appropriation bill. Sometimes it is a constituent?’
who wishes to establish himself in Washington as an employee of the
Federal Government, preferably in the Civil Service. Sometimes it is
a4 request that you ask a colleague who serves on some committee to
provide some means to compensate someone for a loss without ta/(in g

96 [30’s

the matter to court. Sometimes you are5 requested to consult with
some bureau of the governm-entlof the United States to determine what
amount of money may be available for expenditure“ in some emer—
gency.

This morning I was asked to introduce a resolution for the purpose
of regulating and reducing the expenses of the N ationall Government.
As I told my friend, everyone is in favor of some limitation of the
expenses of the National Government during the election.8 That is the
one time when «economy really becomes popular. It seems to me that
everybody becomes very economical during the election ;9 but, as soon
as that emergency is over and the American people go back to their
accustomed tasks, it soon becomes apparent that no practical provision”
is made in the legislation introducedlon the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives’. It is a fact that the average member of the House of
Representatives“ has good intentions to carry out his election promises
of economy——but this economy must not involve the interests of his
constituents.” As a result, it is seldom that circumstances permit any-
thing but increases in appropriations. In other words‘, nobody is
against13 economy; nobody is for larger expenditures; but, when the
legislation comes to conference, nobody will take the responsibility of
refusing” requests for larger appropriations.

Economy in general is always popular with the administrator and

with those in charge of the legislation;15 but you will notice that, when

it comes to economy in particular, the administrator or the bureau head
can always point out some good reason why the service” in question
must be carried on for the beneﬁt of the taxpayer. I have observed this
process from time to time during my many years of service as one of”
the members of the House, and in my judgment it is not fair to blame
the Department of, I ustice or the Secretary of the Treasury or the Sec-
retary of” Agriculture or the gentleman from New York or the
Senator from Michigan or the Chairman of this committee or that
committee. ‘

We must bear in mind that this” situation will be observed in the
House and in the Senate. In every case that I have been informed of,
Whether by following the debate on the floor of this” House or by my
accumulated correspondence, the responsibility for failing to take deﬁ—
nite action to stop the constant increases in appropriation“ bills like

30’s] 97

the pending bill may be divided equally between ‘the Senate and the
House of Representatives. And at the'moment it seems to me that it
would” be fair tovsay that this responsibility may be divided equally
between both sides of the House of Representatives and both sides of
the Senate. _

Now this” does not make up a very pretty picture,“ but we might as
well be practical about these things and admit that these practices have
been standard in most legislative“ houses all over the world. We have
tried in every way possible to stop unnecessary expenditures and to re-
duce the expenses of the National” Government. We have tried to
regulate the increases that seem necessary if we are to carry on services
that are desirable under the circumstances.” A year ago this same
matter was debated on the floor. The gentleman from Michigan at
that time pointed out that it would be wise to put some effective”
limitation on the expenditures of the government of the United States.

He was very emphatic .in pointing out that we cannot have prosperity

if” wages do not keep up with prices and that the purchasing power of
wages is strongly inﬂuenced by the appropriations made by the Con-
gress of the U nited29 States and by the expenses of the National Gov-
ernment.

At that time, however, the members of the House were more inter-
ested in debating the issues involved3° in the treaty in regard to agri-
culture. Of course, this treaty was important; but, as the gentleman
from Michigan said then, and as he has repeated so31 often, the legisla-
tion we pass and the activities of the administrators and bureau heads
right here in the Districtvof Columbia will have more effect” on the
prosperity and purchasing power and production of the American peo-
ple than almost anything else that might happen. In my judgment no
treaty33 can compensate for our failure to establish the necessary limi-
tations of expenditures here and now. .

The average taxpayer is a very practica citizen and will accept no
explanation of our failure to provide for full production—no matter
what the reason and no matter where the actual35 responsibility may
lie. When election time comes again, he will not ask whether you are
discussing a treaty with some foreign power. He will not ask why
you failed“ to make provision for the prosperity that would insure an
increase in his wages and a decrease in his taxes. He is not interested

98 [3Q’s

Z34

in being informed?” of the reasons why no jobs are available or why
he cannot earn a fair amount of money, so that he may provide for his
family. In my judgment he” will vote on the facts as they affect him
at the moment of the election. In other words, the taxpayer wants re-
sults rather than explanations. If you don’t take notice39 of this situa-
tion, your constituents will ﬁnd someone better informed and more
practical than you are, someone who will carry out the wishes of the
community4° with less debate and more action. (1,207 standard words)

110. High—Speed Take No. 23—Government Personnel

Mr. President, as a new member of the committee, I wish to join

I in the report of the chairman and in the statement he has made with
‘reference to continuing1 the various committees under the emergency

. resolutions which have been reported.

I wish to state also that I appreciate the attitude of2 the committee
in approving the appropriation for the Small Business Committee. I
happen to be a member of that committee, and I join with the junior3
Senator from Montana in stating to the membership of the Senate that
We need such a practical committee of the Senate. We need it in order
to help the small-business‘ men throughout the country to interpret
the orders of the various executive agencies. I endorse everything the
Senator said. V

I also agree with5 what has been stated by the senior Senator from
Illinois. As I looked at the different proposals pending at the ﬁrst meet—
ing of the committee, it occurred“ to me that they were conclusive
evidence of the need for the adoption of the resolution I presented last
August.

I am convinced that the Small Business7 Committee needs all the
personnel it has in order to carry on its work. I think it is one of the
most important committees of the Senate. I am also of8 the opinion
that, if the employees were employed directly, they would be loyal
beyond any question. I do not mean to say they are not loyal now; but,

30’s] 99

being9 employed by a department, they have a certain loyalty to that
department which otherwise they might give to the Senate committee
in a study of the problems” covered in the investigations.

The junior Senator from Montana appointed me on a subcommit-
tee, together with the junior Senator from Tennessean. If I am cor-
rect, we have had about 50 subcommittee investigations, and we have
done a tremendous amount of work in helping to amend and” clarify
Executive orders. ' *

I wish to commend the Senator from Illinois and the committee for
the action they have taken. They have served notice on the13 Senate
that it should recognize this practice, and thatiwe should investigate
it. The life of most of the committees has been extended to Iuly 1,
and they go before” the Committee on Appropriations and establish
their justiﬁcation for an appropriation if they need more employees.

Last August I raised a question” about Senate committees borrow-
ing persons‘ from Government agencies in the District of Columbia,
Those I had in mind are most often provided by” departmental agen-
cies of Senate committees. They are not paid oﬂicials of the Senate,
and they are not regular employees of the Senate committees.

Almost" every Senate committee has at some time had the services
of experts and clerical assistants lent to them by Government depart—
ments. ,Some of these individuals” often serve with Senate committees
for months at a time. The practice of borrowing Government person-
nel is a longstanding one. I know that there are many” reasons why
the practice is continued, and I do not arbitrarily condemn it.

However, there are aspects of this practice which have appeared to
be questionable.” ‘

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT

(Fourth Inaugural Address, January 20, 1945.)

Mr. Chief Iustice, Mr. Vice—President, My Friends:

You will understand and, I believe, agree with my wish that the
form of this inauguration be simple and its1 words brief.

100 V [30’s

We Americans of today, together with our Allies, are passing
through a period of supreme test. It is a test of our courage—-of our
resolve—-of2 our wisdom-of our essential democracy. '

If we meet that test—successfully and honorably—we shall perform
a service of historic importance, which men?’ and women and children
will honor throughout all time.

As I stand here today, having taken the solemn oath of oﬂice in the
presence of my fellow countrymen—-in4 the presence of our God—I.
know that it is America’s purpose that we shall not fail.

In the days and years that are to come we shall work for a just
and honorable5 peace as today we work and ﬁght for a total victory in
war.

We can and we will achieve such a peace.

We shall strive for perfection. We shall not achieve it“ immediately
—but we still shall strive. We may make mistakes—but they must

never be mistakes which result from faintness of heart or abandon»-

ment of moral principles.

I remember7 what my old schoolmaster, Dr. Peabody, said in days:
that seemed to us then to be secure and untroubled; he said:

“Things in life will not always run smoothly. Sometimes8 we will
be rising toward the heights—then all will seem to reverse itself and
start downward. The great fact to remember is that the trend of civi-
lization itself is9 forever upward; that a line drawn through the middle
of the peaks and the valleys of the centuries always has an upward
trend.” .

Our Constitution of 178710 was not a perfect instrument; it is not
perfect yet. But it provided a ﬁrm base upon which all manner of
men, of all races and colors and“ creeds, could build our solid struc-
ture of democracy. ,

And so today in this year of war, 1945, we have learned lessons-
at a fearful cost—and we shall” proﬁt by them.

We have learned that we cannot live alone, at peace; that our own
well—being is dependent upon the well—being of other nations, far
away. We have” learned that we must live as men, and not as os-
triches, nor as dogs in the manger.

We have learned to be citizens of the world, members of the human
community.

We” have learned the simple truth, as Emerson said, that “t/ze only
way to have a friend is to be one.” '

We can gain no lasting peace if we approach it with suspicion and”
mistrust——or with fear. We can gain it only if we proceed with the
understanding and the conﬁdence and the courage which flow from
conviction. ’

The Almighty God has blessed” our land in many ways. He has
given our people stout hearts and strong -arms with which to strike
mighty blows for our freedom and truth. He has given to our coun-
try a faith which” has become the hope of all peoples in an anguished
world. _ ,

fellow men—to the achievement of His will to peace on earth. (555

4114. High-Speed Take No. 24—Cooperatives

Mr. Speaker, 100 years ago in a little English village 27 men and 1
woman worked out a new method of meeting the economic needs‘
of the common people of the world. These people met together be-
cause they and their fellow citizens were in want of the common
necessities of life. They had tried2 to obtain an increase in their wages
and failed. In searching for some_method of relieving their families’
hardships, they hit upon the idea of pooling their?’ resources and par-
chasing power and going into business for themselves. In other words,
if they bought together the things they all needed, they thought they
could reduce’ the cost of the necessities of life.

It took them a whole year to accumulate a capital of 28 British
pounds with which to pay three months’ rental on a5 little shop and
to purchase their ﬁrst supplies. At ﬁrst people made fun of them, but
that did not stop them. They had rediscovered the one basic principle

102 [30’s

upon which all“ human society must in the end be based, the principle
of group loyalty. On that principle they built their little business, and
out of that principle has grown7 the most solid single hope of human
betterment that this world knows.

For that little shop in England gave birth to the cooperative move—

ment which today claims the actives support of more than 100,000,000.

people throughout the world. In England today the original group
has 30,000 members and a capital of” 558,000 British pounds, while
one sixth of all British retail trade is handled by cooperatives.

The light of this movement spread to other countries. In1° Sweden,

in Switzerland, in Finland, and in'30 or more other countries the
cooperative movement developed.

In our country small cooperative societies“ began to develop almost
a hundred years ago. Many failed and then revived again. Later the
cooperative movement spread to the farms and resultedwin the tre-
mendous Grange movement of the nineteenth century. After another
period of decline there began to grow the cooperative movement of
today,” perhaps the strongest united movement among the American
people.

It is difficult to obtain accurate estimates of membership in this

country,” but it is fair to say that pretty nearly 12,000,000 of our people .

are associatedwith cooperatives of various kinds. At least one third
of American” farmers belong to some type of cooperative. More than
one third of the food supplied to our armed forces has been sent
through cooperatives. Thousands of our” city people have been organ-
ized into cooperative societies which include farm.ers and city workers
alike, for the cooperative movement is” one which abolishes class lines
of all kinds and brings together men of all classes.

Cooperatives ‘once established are strong institutions. Even opposi-
tion” of the cruelest kind cannot kill them. ~

At this moment, cooperatives are of the utmost importance to the

ABRAHAM LINCOLN

(Second Inaugural Address, March 4, 1865.)

Fellow Countrymen: At this second appearing to take the oath of
the presidential oﬂice, there is less occasion for an_extended address
than there was at the1 ﬁrst. Then a statement, somewhat in detail, of
a course to be pursued, seemed ﬁtting and proper. Now, at the expira-
tion of four years, during which public declarationsz have been con-
stantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which
still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation,
little that?’ is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon
which all else chieﬂy depends, is as well known to the public as to
myself; and it is, I trust, reasona'Z7ly4 satisfactory and encouraging to
all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is
ventured.

On the occasion corres ondin to5 this four ears d 0, all thou hts .

were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it——-
all sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was“ being deliv-
ered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without
war, insurgent agents in the city were seeking to destroy it Without
war—7seeking to dissolve the Union, and divide effects, by negotia-
tion. Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war
rather than let the nation survive,8 and the other would accept war
rather than let it perish. And the war came.

One—eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not dis-
tributed generctlZy9 over the Union, but localized in the southern part
of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All
knew that this interest was, somehow,” the cause of the war. To
strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for
which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the“
Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the terri-
torial enlargement of it.

Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration”
which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the
conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should
cease. Each looked for an easier” triumph, and a result less funda-

mental and astounding. Both read the same Bible, and pray to the
same God; and each invokes his aid against the other. It may” seem
strange that any men should dare to ask a just God’s assistance in
wringing their bread from the sweat of other men’s faces; but let us
judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers” of both could not
be answered——that of neither has been answered fully.

The Almighty has his own purposes. “Woe unto the world because
of offenses! for it must needs” be that offenses come; but woe to that
man by whom the offense cometh.” If we shall suppose that American
slavery is one of those oﬁ‘enses which, in the providence" of God, must
needs come, but which, having continued through his appointed time,
he now wills to remove, and that he gives to both North and South
this terrible war, as them woe due to those by whom the offense came,
shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes
which the believers in a living God always ascribe” to him? Fondly
do we hope—fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war
may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the
wealth piled2° by the bondsman’s two hundred and ﬁfty years of
unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn
with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with“ the sword, as was
said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, “The judgments
of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.”

With malice toward none, with charity for” all, with ﬁrmness in
the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to ﬁnish the
work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who
shall have borne2‘°’ the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do
all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among our-
selves, and with all nations. (716 standard words)

Mr. President, I think it unfortunate, in connection with this mat-
ter, that Member: of the Senate and of the House seem to feel that it is

30’s] 105

important for them1 to defend the original positions which they took
instead of acting on the facts as they are now. I refer, for example, to
the members of the Civil Service‘? Committee in the House. I read the
debate on the floor of the House the other day; and I ﬁnd that the Rep-
resentative from Minnesota, feeling that his3 committee was right in
recommending this extension, is now pursuing the policy of letting
the country understand the reasons which moved him. I can under-
stand‘ that. T

I feel that the Senator from Virginia today has taken a personal
view of the argument. Probably he was entitled to take a personal5
view because of some language that I used; but before he recently
took the floor I disavowed any intention to cast any personal reflection
upon the6 Senator from Virginia. I do so again. That was not my pur-
pose then; it is not my purpose now.

When I rose to take the ﬂoor today to speak about this matter,7 it
was for the purpose of applauding the notice given by the Senator from
Kentucky that it is his purpose to seek early repeal°of this provision. I8
believe that the fundamental arguments which the Senator from Vir-
ginia has made. are correct. I believe that elective oﬂicers who must
submit themselves9 to the vote of the people should realize that, under
our system, they must go to the people from time to time for a new
commission. They do not fall into“) the same category as civil service

I employees who take an examination and acquire a permanent status

as permanent employees. I can see” a difference between a civil serv-
ice clerk and a Member of Congress. I can see a difference between a
Federal Court judge, who receives retirement at” full pay without
payment into a retirement fund, and a Member of Congress. There
ought to be a difference; and, for my own part, I am content to appear
before my1‘°’ constituents and have my right to speak for them renewed
or withdrawn. I do not ask any special compensation or any retirement
for that service.”

However, Mr. Presia’ent, because I am jealous of the good reputa-
tion of Members of this body and of Members of the House, I think it
is very” unfortunate that statements such as that just read by the
Senator from Virginia do not present the picture as it actually is. Of
course, the Senator is right.” If a Member of this body has served
since 1915, is 62 years of age, and meets the other qualiﬁcations, he is

106 [30’s

entitled to a pension” of $3,000 or ‘$4,000, or whatever it may be; but
Member: of the Home or Senate who have served 25 or 30 years are
no longer” young men, in the ﬁrst place, and constitute only a small
proportion of the entire membership in the second place.

My point is that the fact: have not been made clear to19 the people
of the United States who think that the maximum retirement beneﬁts
can be obtained by every Member of Congress; whereas, that is not
the fact.”

The fact that silence is golden may explain why there is so little left
of it. ‘

WOODROW WILSON

(An appeal to the country to make the election of 1920 an expression
of the Nation’s opinion on the League of Nations, October 3, 1920.)

The issues of the present campaign are of such tremendous impor-
tance, of such far—reaching signiﬁcance for the influence of the country
and the development1 of its future relations, and I have necessarily had
so much to do with their development, that I am sure you will think
it natural and proper that I2 should address to you a few words con-
cerning them. I

Everyone who sincerely believes in government by the people must
rejoice at the turn affairs have taken in?’ regard to this campaign. This
election is to be a genuine national referendum. The determination of
a great policy upon which the influence4 and authority of the United
States in the world must depend is not to be left to groups of poli-
ticians of either party, but is to be referred5 to the people themselves
for a sovereign mandate to their representatives. They are to instruct
their own Government what they wish done.

The chief question that is put to“ you is, of course: Do you want
your country’s honor vindicated and the Treaty of Versailles ratiﬁed?
Do you in particular approve of the League as organized7 and empow-
ered in that treaty? And do you wish to see the United States play its
responsible part in it? ,

You have been misled with regard to the treaty, and particularly8
with regard to the proposed character of the League, by those who

30’s] s 107

have assumed the serious responsibility of opposing it. They have
gone so far9 that those who have spent their lives, as I have spent my
life, in familiarizing themselves with the history and traditions and
policies of the nation must stand amazed” at the gross ignorance and
impudent audacity which have led them to attempt to invent an
“Americanism” of their own, which has no foundation whatever“ in
any of the authentic traditions of the Government.

Americanism, as they conceive it, reverses the whole process of the
last few tragicalm years. It would substitute America for Prussia in
the policy of isolation and deﬁant segregation. Their conception of
the dignity of the1‘°’ nation and its interest is that we should stand apart
and watch for opportunities to advance our own interests, involve
ourselves in no responsibility for” the maintenance of the right in the
world or for the continued vindication of any of the things for which
we entered the war to ﬁght.

The conception of the great” creators of the Government was abso-
lutely opposite to this. They thought of America as the light of the
world as created to lead the world in the assertion” of the rights of
peoples and the rights of free nations; as destined to set a responsible
example to all the world of what free government is and can do" for
the maintenance of right standards, both national and international.

This light the opponents of the League would quench. They would
relegate the United States to a13 subordinate role in the affairs of the
World.

Why should we be afraid of responsibilities which we are qualiﬁed
to sustain and which the whole of our history” has constituted a
promise to the world we would sustain! v

‘This is the most momentous issue that has ever been presented to
the people of the U nited2° States; and I do not doubt that the hope of
the whole world will be veriﬁed by an absolute assertion by the voters
of the country of the determination of“ the United States to live up
to all the great expectations which they created by entering the war
and enabling the other great nations of the world to bring” it to a
victorious conclusion, to the confusion of Prussianism and everything
that arises out of Prussianism. Surely we shall not fail to23 keep the
promise sealed in the death and sacriﬁce of our incomparable soldiers,
sailors and marines who await our verdict beneath the sod of France.

Those who do not“ care to tell you the truth about the League
tell you that Article X of the Covenant of the League would make it
possible for other nations to lead us into war,25 whether we will it by

 our own independent judgment or not. This is absolutely false. There

is nothing in the Covenant which in the least interferes with or im-
pairs” the rights of Congress to declare war according to its own inde-
pendent judgment, as our Constitution provides.

Those who drew the Covenant of the League were careful” that
it should contain nothing which interfered with or impaired the con-
stitutional arrangements of any of the great nations which are to con-
stitute its members.” They would have been amazed and indignant
at the things that are now being ignorantly said about this great an
sincere document. . '

would wait for an intimation of what its future is to be. (886 standard

Mr. President, it has become increasingly obvious that Congress
helped to create an unfortunate situation when it provided that Mem-
bers of Congress‘ should be permitted to participate in the beneﬁts of
the Civil Serz/ice Retirement Act. I do not mean to apologize for the
Act itself, or for2 the inclusion of elected oﬂicials, because I think the
legislation was justified. What has happened since that time, however,
indicates that the passage of?’ the bill in its existing form was unfor-
tunate. For that reason, I desire to associate myself with those who
feel that the part of the law dealing with Members‘ of Congress
should be immediately repealed.

It is of no great importance now that people do not clearly under-
stand it. It matters not at all now that no special5 favoritism was
granted to Members of Congress under the legislation or that much of

30’s] 109

what has been printed about it has been in error. All that matters,“

‘it seems to me, is that many people in the country have lost faith in

the Congress——and that faith must be quickly restored. Only Members
of Congress can completely7 restore it.

For a long time past Congress has been the “whipping boy” for
certain individuals or small groups of our population. I do not refer to
criticisms8 of Congress, because it is best for Congress that it be criti—
cized when it deserves criticism. We shall do our best work under
the lash of fair criticism,9 and I welcome constructive criticism; but,
Mr. President, a danger is created when Congress is held up to ridicule.

I have been a Member of Congress” for about nine years. Two
years ago ‘II was a candidate for reelection; and at that time I stated
over and over again that, if I were again called” upon to act on any
of the proposals of the previous eight years, I would not change a
single vote. It is with deep regret that I now ﬁnd myself in the posi—
tion” of being no longer able to make that statement. In my recent
campaign for reelection I went through the unique experience of not
having had to” suffer a single word of open criticism of my service.
‘Insofar as I know, no newspaper in my State criticized a vote I had
cast; and my opponent“ in the election did not offer a single word of

V criticism of any act or any vote of mine during my years of service

here. Now I would change 2115 vote, and I am hopeful that I may
be afforded the opportunity to do so within the next few days.

A part of the reason for the criticism Congress” received over the
retirement bill is due to a suspicion that Members of Congress enjoy
many special privileges. Members of Congress know that this is not
the case." Some think that we are free from the payment of taxes and
thus enjoy greater purchasing power. Some people think that we are
given free transportation when we travel” to and from our States,
and elsewhere. The truth of the matter, of course, is that we have one
round‘—trip for each session, while some of us make the trip dozens of
times each year.”

Some people feel that Senators enjoy free telephone service, when
as a matter of fact we pay substantial amounts from our own pockets
for the use of the telephone.”

WoRKER’s TIME IN DOLLARS AND CENTS

Whenever I hear oﬂice employees complain because their managers
check up on their time, I think of the words of a manager I once
worked for. '

He was not a very1 popular man in the oﬂice, and on this particular
occasion one of the employees had either resigned, or had threatened
to, on the ground that the manager2 was nothing better than a “slave
driver.” In defense, he replied:

“Imagine yourself in a meter taxicab. You are responsible for the

fare. Your driver hails?’ a friend, stops, gets out, and starts to chat,

leaving the meter still registering. Two minutes pass and he is still
chatting. Three minutes—ﬁve minutes—still he goes on. The charge
against4 you is mounting. You are not moving. Wouldn’t you get
‘bothered’ about it?” he asked us.

We had to admit we might, even though we suspected a moral.

“ ‘Bothered’ because5 you are being charged for a service you are
not receiving?” he persisted.

“Precisely,3’ said we. Whereupon he declared he had proved our
complaint against him as out“ of order‘. .

“Every minute from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,” he explained, “registers
a charge against the ﬁrm for your service. I represent the ﬁrm; and
when you fail7 to give this service, I have to act, for I am responsible.”

But he really won us over when he showed us our lost time in dol-

-lars and cents. We were amazed. Here8 are some of the things he

brought out.

We have twenty clerks in our oﬁice, averaging about ‘$20 a week,
which, ﬁgured on the basis of an eight-hour day,9 is approximately 45
cents an hour. Of this daily eight-hour service, how many hours will
clerks work? Say seven, that means that an hour per clerk is lost
daily. Is1° seven hours reasonable? Let us see how easy it is to ac—
count for an hour’s lost time: 15 minutes late in the morning, 10 min-
utes late back from lunch, 10 minutes“ early closing, 10 minutes to
make .a personal telephone call, 10 minutesto tell a joke, 5 minutes to
watch an airplane from the window——and the hour is gone.

Twenty” clerks, earning ‘$20 a week and losing an hour each day
for a year. Figure it out and you’ll ﬁnd that it amounts to over $2,000!

Now let us” turn to our more ‘advanced employee5—department
-heads and the like. Suppose we have ten on our staff az/erczging about
$50 a week, which is approximately” eight hours a day at $1.15 an
hour. Will they lose an hour a day? They might not knowingly, but
let us see.

They make and receive a number of telephone” calls, and now
and again they feel chatty; ﬁfteen minutes pass without being noticed.

They are not very strict as to who gets in to see them. Salesmen
with whom they” will never do business come in and take up their
time; ﬁfteen minutes lost.

A fellow member of the oﬂ-ice has been somewhere and has seen

‘or heard something. He drops in to” talk about it; ﬁfteen minutes

lost. .

They go out during the morning for coffee or leave early at night
to avoid the crowd at the garage—another ﬁfteen minutes“ cut from
the working day. The hour is gone.

These practices are not uncommon. Well, then, ten senior employ-
ee: earning $50 a Week, losing an hour each day for a19 year. What
does it amount to ?——nearly $3,000. Add this to the previous $2,000 and
we have $5,000 to charge to “time not made”!

When our2° manager had put down, in black and white, an esti-
mate of time needlessly lost, we no longer resented his efforts to check
up on our time. 5

And when we look at21 employees’ time from this angle, do we not
also ﬁnd ourselves placing a different value on timesaving methods
and equipment? Employees’ time has become something” more to
us than so many seconds. We see it in ﬁgures-—in dollars and cents.

— Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the membership of the committee, I
want to express to the gentleman from Michigan our sincere»-thanks
for the impartial and patient1 manner of conducting the hearings held

_in regard to the pending bill. I think every man on this subcommittee,

whether he belonged to the minority” or to the majority, was given
ample opportunity to present anything he desired to present or to
interrogate any Witnesses he desired3 to interrogate. The chairman
was most fair. He did not place any limitations on anyone. As a
result, full and free opportunity was given to bring out all sides of4
every question that was presented here.

Something was said a moment ago about the fact that the very
eﬂieient clerk, who has been of service to this committee5 for a number
of years, is about to resign and enter the naval service of this country.
I Want to join those who have spoken in saying that Iack Brown is as
most eﬂicient and effective clerk.

This bill covers three executive departments. Consequently, it is
made up of a multitude of items, some of which are large7 and some
of which are small. But it did not make any difference What part of

the bill the chairman or any member of the committee desired infor'- ‘

mation about,8 our clerk had it and had it immediately. It is going
to be a decided loss, a loss that I do not see how we are going to ﬁll,
when we lose Jack Brown9 as clerk of this committee. We all wish
him the best of luck.

Another man is retiring from Congress. He was a member of the
Appropriations Committee——the1° gentleman from Washington who
has been called to ﬁll a judgeship in the Federal Court. The gentleman
from Washington is not on this subcommittee, but it has been” my
privilege for a number of years to serve on other subcommittees with
him. He is a hard worker. He has high standards. He has always
been courteous, and” I am sure we all wish him a long and successful
career on the bench in the State of Washington.

Mr. Chairman, the provisions of this bill have been well covered
by” the chairman of the subcommittee. I am one of the minority
members of this subcommittee. I feel very sincerely that we must cut
these appropriation“ bills as deeply as We can and trim all items as

30’s] 113

much as possible in order that the taxpayers of this country may be
able to carry the load. This bill15 and all other bills that come from
appropriation: subcommittee: keep growing year after year. When you
look at""the resume of this bill on page 2 of the report,” you may say
it is $150 million under that bill for these same departments last year.
That is what the ﬁgures show; but in reality the ﬁgures” do not tell
the exact story. In last year’s bill we had an item for the development
of landing ﬁelds throughout the country. This item. does not appear
in this year’s18 bill; so, if you go through the bill item by item, you
will ﬁnd that there is actually a gradual increase in the appropriation:
granted by this committee.”

I made the statement before the full Committee on Appropriation:
yesterday morning that the appropriation bill: that we were bringing
in here were all bad.2°

Always do right; you will gratify some people and astonish the rest.

A CITIZEN ARMY

Since the War of 1812, most of our military unpreparedness and V

most of our enormous military expenditures have been chargeable to1
two conﬂicting views as to the merits of two mutually antagonistic
types of military organization. One of these may be characterized as2
the citizen—army type, the other as the standing-army type. In the
War Department’s plans for a postwar military, structure, which of
these two styles of architecture3 should the planners follow?
Fortunately, this fundamental question _has been answered by
General Marshall, Chief of Staﬁ‘ of the Army. He has directed the4
General Staff and all other planning agencies under his jurisdiction to
adapt their plans to the citizen—army formula. It will help us to grasp

the5 full signiﬁcance of this important decision if we will consider the _

origins and places of these two military types in our past history.
Generai6 Marshall is not proposing anything new. He is simply
directing his planners to make a modern adaptation of the plan that
President Washington7 submitted to the First Congress in January, 1790,
as one of the essential foundations of the new American republic. This

114 [30’s

0
17908 plan was prepared by Major General Henry Knox, our ﬁrst Secre-
tary of War, and was revised to meet the President’s views before he
transmitted9 it to the Congress. It was based upon the fundamental

democratic principle that every citizen in a free state should be trained

to defend his country.” It contained simple and economical machinery
for the orderly mobilization of all or any necessary part of the nation's
man power“ in ample time to meet any military emergency.

The Washington—Knox plan was very simple and may be outlined
brieﬂy as follows.

For a few” weeks in their nineteenth summer, again in their twen-
tieth summer, and ﬁnally in their twenty-ﬁrst summer, all young
Americans were to be trained as citizen soldiers” of what Knox called
“Camps of Discipline.” During these three years, all these citizen
soldiers in each community were to be enrolled in local units of what
Knox called” the “Advanced Corps” of the national citizen army, held
in readiness for a call to arms if necessary. "

In addition to his citizen soldiers, Washington” insisted that there
must also be enough highly ‘trained Regular oﬁicers and soldiers to’ do
those things that obviously cannot be done by citizen soldiers.“ In
Washington’s day, this meant the national military overhead, teachers
in the military schools, guards for the national arsenals, and troops to
garrison” the posts on the Indian frontier.

In the event of an Indian war or other emergency that would re—_
quire a temporary reinforcement of the“ normal Regular Army, each
community was to furnish its equitable quota of citizen officers and
soldiers. If any community should fail” to ﬁll its quota with volun-
teers, the shortage would be filled by what we would call a selective
draft within that community. .

In the event of a great national” emergency, all citizen soldiers
under the age of twenty—two would be mobilized immediately in their
local units of the Advanced Corps. (629 standard words) (Continued in

Mr. Chairman, in my judgment, Congress will not be the same to
me when Mr. Smith leaves. It has been a privilege for me for the past
30 years to be able .to call him‘ my personal friend. My contact with
him has been almost daily. When I had a diflicult problem, I would
always consult him. His counsel and advice have been2 extremely
beneﬁcial. I

I do not feel that anyone who knows him will challenge the state-
ment that he is as well informed on the fiscal regulations of the3 Gov-
ernment as any individual. Aside from that, his knowledge of the
workings of the various departments and independent agencies of the
Government4 is not surpassed by anyone. This, together with his sense
of responsibility and his integrity, has made him a most important part
of our establis/zment.5

If the people were aware of how the Appropriations Committee
functions and the part the clerk of the committee ta/(es, they would
better understand how indispensable6 Mr. Smith has been to the mem-
bers of that committee. Take the bill now before the House. Deficiency
and supplemental appropriation requests are7 sent to the House by the
President. Each item is separate and is printed. The clerk is charged
with putting the requests in bill form. Mr. Smith, having a thorough
knowledge8 of law, is capable of preparing a tentative bill, the legality
of which cannot be questioned. For two weeks or more member: of
the committee question9 the oﬂicials as to previous appropriation: and
how they were spent.

When the hearings are over, the permanent bill is then prepared.
When agreed upon by the” subcommittee, it is presented to the full
committee and then to the House. The Members, I am sure, have
noticed the many books on the committee table when the“ bill is
under consideration. Whenever a Member raises a point of order, you
will ﬁnd Mr. Smith‘ reaching for a book and‘ then pointing out the
authority” to the member of the committee in charge. When Mem—
bers question the advisability of an appropriation again you will ﬁnd
Mr. Smith pointing outl?’ to member: of the subcommittee the hear-
ings marked with additional information, to answer the attack on the
appropriation.

After the House acts on the” bill, the clerk follows it to the Senate

and then prepares it for conference. He sits with the conferees and I

ﬁnally writes the conference report. It is a job that“ one cannot learn

« overnight.

I know that Mr. Smith did not come to a ﬁnal decision in regard
to leaving the Congress, taking his own welfare solely into” considera-
tion. He had told me that as long as he remained as clerk of the
committee his loyal associateson the committee had no opportunity?’
for advancement. He was thinking of his subordinates; and it was not
until he was assured that, if he left the committee, the other clerks
would be promoted that” he announced to the chairman his determi-
nation to retire.

We are going to miss Mr. Smith, and I am sure that he leaves with
the best wishes of every Member” of this House. He is not the type
of man that can long be inactive, and I understand he is going to do
some writing. For this I know he is well qualiﬁed.” ’

A CITIZEN ARMY (Continued)

Washington attached great importance to trained leadership. In '

an address to the Congress, less than four months after his inaugura-
tion, he urged that war-experiencedl veterans of the Continental Army
should form the original oﬂicer corps of .this new citizen army. These
war veterans were to.be replaced2 gradually by the graduates of a
system of military schools. In 1783, he proposed the establishment of

~ “one or more” military?’ academies. A year later, he indorsed General

Steuben’s proposal that there should be a minimum of three such
academies, one‘in New England, one in‘ the middle states, and one
south of the Potomac—and this when our total population was less
than 4,000,000. Later Knox incorporated Steuben’s proposal in5 his
own plan. It is obvious that these three military academies would train
many more officers than would be needed for the little Regular "Army
of“ about 2,500 men with which Washingtonproposed to guard the
Indian frontier. A great majority of their graduates would therefore
return to their homes7 to become the trained leaders of this citizen
army.

30’s]   . 117

But this was not to be. After two years of debate and agitation, the
Congress ﬁnally adopteds Washington’s scheme for a nation—wide
citizen army, but not until it had carefully eliminated every provision
for training its soldiers and for providing” it with qualiﬁed olﬁcers.

In a message to the Congress shortly after the outbreak of World
War I, President Wilson said that the traditional” foundation of our
military system was a “citizenry trained and accustomed to arms.”
This hint from its commander in chief made no perceptible impres-
sion upon“ the General Staﬁr, for it immediately proceeded to make
plans for an expansible standing army on a large scale. As at result,
when a great war army” of citizen soldiers was required a little later,
it had to be extemporized, as in the past. Again, as at the beginning
of the Civil War, many” trained professional officers who should have
become leaders and staff oﬂicers in the wartime citizen army were
tied up in new Regular Army regiments.“

After World War I,'there was a widespread popular opinion that
the citizen army, developed at such ‘enormous cost during the recent
war, should be perpetuated” as a permanent national institution
through a system of universal military training. This policy was advo-
cated by the citizen-army” veterans who were then establishing the
American Legion, and was indorsed by many Regular Army oﬂicers,
including General" Pershing. Unfortunately, the War Department
recommended another policy based upon a large standing army, with
no provision for the development” of our traditional citizen army.
But for these divided counsels, the National Defense Act of 1920 might
well have contained a complete” legislative solution of our national
military problem based upon universal military training. (591 standard

134. High—Speed Take No. 29—Government Personnel

Mr. Speaker, 43 years ago today Allister Cochrane, a young man
from Detroit, was called upon as a substitute to report the debates in
this House. From1 that day, Mr. Speaker, without interruption, Mr.
Cochrane has continued to render invaluable and faithful service to the
House of Representatives? He has endeared himself to every Member
of the H oase on both sides of the aisle in this and every one of the 23
Congresses he has so ably served, from3 January 31, 1902, down to the
present. "

It is doubly ﬁtting, Mr. Speaker, that we should pause for a few
moments today to acknowledge‘ our indebtedness to this faithful serv-
ant of the people. In addition to marking the forty—third anniversary
of Mr. Cochrane’s employment by the House,5 this day also marks the
seventy-sixth anniversary of his birth. It is regrettable, Mr. Speaker,
that Mr. Cochrane cannot be present today to receive“ our personal
felicitations, but he is now at home recovering from a severe operation.
Fortunately, I am informed that his recoVery7 is such that he expects
to carry on his duties as Oﬂicial Reporter of Debates in the near future.
I am sure I speak for every Member of this House ins saying that we
rejoice in the prospect of his early return.

Mr. Cochrane came to this House on January 31, 1902, as a substitute9
reporter and served in that capacity for two years. He was then ap-
pointed Oﬂicial Reporter of Debates by the Speaker of the House. At
the time of his initial1° appointment he was employed in Detroit as
oflicial reporter of Wayne County. He had obtained a leave of absence
from that position to accept a special” assignment in Washington.

‘He was called in as a House reporter suddenly and without an oppor-

tunity to prepare. In the opinion of his early” associates, he handled
the job like a veteran from the first day; and hewas induced to con-
tinue his service. .

Since that time he has served under 10 speakers. In” addition to
reporting debates in the House, Mr. Cochrane was called upon to
render like service at international conferences and special congres-
sional” proceedings at times when the House was not in session. Out-
standing among these special assignments was the Hague International
Conference in 1907.15

30’s] 119

I deem it a very special privilege, Mr. Speaker, to be able to call
these facts to the attention of the House. Like most of the Members
of this House, especially” those of us who have had the honor of serv-
ing here for any length of time, I have always held Mr. Cochrane in
the highest esteem. I have admired him for" his devotion to the
Congress and to our great Nation. Without employees like him the
National Government could not function effectively, and it might well
be that” its reputation as the greatest parliamentary body in the world
would never have been acquired.

We in Michigan are proud indeed of the fact that Mr. Cochrane”
was raised and educated in our schools, working his way through the
Detroit College of Law.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud indeed to ‘call Allister Cochrane my
friend.” .

A CITIZEN ARMY (Concluded)

Failure to establish a sound system after the last war found us in
dire straits at the beginning of World War II. Again it became neces-
sary to extemporizel the national citizen army with which we have
fought all our great wars. In accomplishing this tremendous construc-
tive task, General Marshall and his assistants2 have demonstrated on
battleﬁelds throughout the world that the American army of the
people is superior in sheer military might to the much—vaunted3 armies
«of the Axis powers. General Marshall’s office directs all planning
agencies under his jurisdiction to make that Army the basis of their
plans for4 a future peace establishment. As Washington did before
him, he bases his military policy upon the democratic principles that
in a free state5 every able-bodied ‘citizen should be trained to defend
his country and that every citizen soldier should be eligible for promo—
tion to any“ rank for which he is able to qualify under sound and
equitable standards.

The Army of the future would comprise a relatively small Regular
Army,7 subject to prompt reinforcement, when necessary, from a great
4citizen—army reserve composed of trained citizen officers and soldiers.
The oﬂicer corps of8 this national army as a whole would comprise

.120 [30’s

relatively few professional oﬂicers and "a relatively great number of
citizen oﬂicers. But the” efficiency of the whole would depend pri-
marily upon the eﬂiciency and the devotion of these professionals.
There can be no effective citizen” army without them.

The citizen army advocated by General Marshall would meet our
military requirements, whatever the future world organization” may
be. It would not be provocative of war, as great standing armies are.
It would be organized for the prompt reinforcement of a relatively
small Regular” Army in the formation of such expeditionary forces,
great or small, as would enable us to do our part in suppressing law-

less aggression. It would” thus assure our friends and warn our poten— ‘

tial foes that hereafter America will be not only willing but able and
ready to do her part in maintaining a“ peaceful world order.

It would also form the basis for a military system of maximum
economy. Under a system of universal military” training, the money
required to maintain one oﬂicer or man on the permanent establish-
ments of our armed forces would maintain several trained reserve oili-
cers.16 With such a reserve system, our peace establishment would be
capable of rapid expansion and, therefore, a relatively small and inex-
pensive permanent” establislzm-ent would meet our needs. Without

such trained reserves, there would be no such power of rapid expansion, .

and a much larger and more expensive Regular” establishment would
be necessary in order to give us a reasonable degree of security. It may
therefore be laid down as a fundamental principle” that,‘ whenever we
maintain one ofﬁcer or man on the permanent establis/zments of our
ground, sea, or air forces to perform a duty that can be performed”
effectively and in time by trained reserve oﬂicers, we increase the per-
capita cost of our national-defense system unduly and reduce its ulti-
timatem capacity to meet the nation’s requirements in war.———]o/in

The high—speed takes are given in two forms: in shorthand in
Parts I and II; in type in Parts III and IV. By ‘giving Parts I and II
in shorthand—the parts in which all the shortcuts are introduced—the
authors have provided the student with the maximum opportunity to
learn and automatize the shortcuts by practicing them intensively in
context written in shorthand. The key to the shorthand in these takes
is given in this Teacher’s Handbook.

The takes in Parts III and IV are given in type, and a shorthand
preview is given at the beginning of each take.

Length and Dictation Rates of Takes. Part 1. Each take con—
tains 500 words. The key is counted in groups of 25 standard words so
that the material may be dictated at 100, 125, 150, and 175 words a
minute. '

Part II. Each take contains 600 words. The key is counted in
groups of 30 standard words so that the material may be dictated at

.90, 120, 150, and 180 words a minute.

Part III. Each take contains 700 words. The material in the text-
book is counted in groups of 35 standard .words so that the matter may
be dictated at 105, 140, and 175 words a minute. '

Part IV. Each, take (except Assignment 80) contains 800 words.
The material in the textbook is counted in groups of 40 standard words
so that the matter may be dictated at 120, 160, and 200 words a minute.

138. High-Speed Take No. 30—Proposed Legislation

Mr. President, on January 5, I gave notice to the Senate generally
that it was my purpose to call up for Senate action at the earliest1 op-
portunity the so-called treaty amendment to the Constitution. Since that
time I have conferred with the leaders of the Senate. I have also con-
ferred with the2 leaders of the House of Representatives. I have re-

ceived numerous telephone calls" and telegrams from Senators who, ,

for suﬂ-icient reasons, are absent from the?’ city.

I do not share the worry of those who feel that as large a Senate
membership as possible should be present when this amendment is
considered. While I agree4 that that is desirable, the fact should be
borne in mind, Mr. President, that this is simply the initial action to be
taken by this body on the proposal5 for an amendment to the Consti-
tution. This action would be followed by action by the other body, as
everyone knows; and the proposed amendment‘; would then be sent
to the States for their action. If it receives the ratiﬁcation of three
fourths of the States, it will become a part of the Constitution.

Nevertheless,7 Mr. President, I am indeed reluctant to take advan-
tage of the fact that some Senators are absent because they have made
engagements to deliver speechess or have other obligations which pre-
vent their attendance at this time. Consequently, I do not expect to
call up the measure at this particular time. I hope” that it can be
called I up at an early date, however.

I merely wish to say before I take my seat, Mr. President, that the
fact that the announcement was made has“) brought a volume of pro-
test and a volume of support. This, of course, always appears when-
ever we are considering important legislation. Personally, I11 am ready
to submit to the people of the United States any proposal which has
substantial support, regardless of whether I personally approve of” it
or not. I do not have such conﬁdence in the infallibility of my own
judgment on matters of this kind that I should hesitate to present it
to the” people.

This particular proposed constitutional amendment has the.endorse-
ment of both major parties in their platforms. It was introduced in the
Senate with” the support of twenty—four Members of this body. With
that volume of support, it is a matter on which the people should pass,

122 [30’s

regardless of one’s own views. I should belé willing to submit to the
people any proposal which had such support, even a proposal to elim-
inate me from public life. Of course, I would oppose such am pro-
posal when it was presented in my own State, but I would be willing
to submit such a matter to the people.

Let me say in closing that the pending constitutional” amendment
was the result of the labors of a subcommittee headed by the distin-
guished senior Senator from Vermont and is not the measure which”

was originally introduced. Many of those who have protested are not‘

at all familiar with the proposal now before the Senate. Some who
have cited the19 legal opinions of eminent lawyers cannot cite a legal
opinion which applies to the pending measure.

The proposed amendment is completely different.2°

WINSTON CHURCHILL

(Extracts from an address to the Congress of the United States on
December 22, 1941.)

Member: of the Senate and of the Home of Representatiz/es of the
United States: I feel gratefully honored that you should have thus
invited me to enter the‘ United States Senate chamber and address
the Representatives of both branches of Congress.

The fact that my_American forebears have for so many generations2
played their part in the life of the United States and that here I am,
an Englishman, welcomed inyour midst makes this experience one
of the most thrilling in my life,3 which is already long and has not
been entirely uneventful.

I wish that my mother, whose memory I cherish across the vale of
years, could have been here to see‘ me. By the way, I cannot help re-
ﬂecting that if my father had been American and my mother British,
instead of the other way around, I might have got here5 on my own.

. In that case, this would not have been the first time you would
have heard my voice. In that case I would not have neetled any invi-
tation; but if I had, it is hardly“ likely that it would have been unani-
mous. So, perhaps things are better as they are. I may confess, how—

_ 30’s] 123

ever, that I do not feel quite like a ﬁsh out of water7 in a legislative
assembly where English is spoken.

I am a child of the House of Commons. I was brought up in my
father’s house to believe in democracy? trust the people, that was his

I message. I used to see him cheered at meetings and in the streets by

crowds of workingmen way back in those aristocratic Victorian9 days
when Disraeli said, “The world was for the few and for the very few.”
Therefore, I have been in full harmony with the tides which have
ﬂowed on both side: of the Atlantic” against privileges and monop~
oly; and I have steered conﬁdently towards the Gettysburg ideal of
government of the people, by the people, for the people.

I“ owe my advancement entirely to the House of Commons, whose
servant I am. In my country, as in yours, public men are proud to
be the servants of the State and would be” ashamed to be its masters.
On any day, if they thought the people wanted it, the House of Com-
mons could, by a simple vote, remove me from my ofﬁce. But I am
not” worrying about it at all.

As a matter of fact, I am sure they will approve very highly of my
journey here, for which I obtained the King’s permission, in order“
to meet the President of the United States, and to arrange with him for
all that mapping of our military plans and for all those intimate meet-
ings of the” high oﬂicers of both countries which are indispensable

for the successful prosecution of the war.

I should like to say, first of all, how much I have been impressed”
and encouraged by the breadth of View and sense df proportion which I
have found in all quarters over here to which I‘ have had access. Any-
one who did not understand” the size and solidarity of the foundation
of the United States might easily have expected to ﬁnd an excited,
disturbed, self-centered atmosphere, with” all mind: ﬁxed upon the
novel, startling, and painful episodes of sudden war as it hit America.

After all, the United States has been attacked and set upon” by
three most powerfully armed dictator states, the greatest military
power in Europe and the greatest military power in Asia—]apan,
Germany,” and Italy have all declared and are making war upon you,
and the quarrel is opened which can only end in their overthrow or
yours. (626 standard words) (Continued in Par. I42)

141. High-Speed Take No. 31—Proposed Legislation

Mr. President, I shall be very glad to have the Senator explain his
statement. It seems to me, in view of the fact that a standing commit—
tee of the Senate1 has direct jurisdiction of the subject matter and has
reported the bill, that to appoint a special committee would be a direct
reflection on every2 member of the committee. May I say further that,
soifar as I am concerned, if the proposal of the Senator from North
Carolina is not wise, we should oppose3 it by an overpowering vote.

Mr. President, on what ground has the committee abandoned its
own section 2? Frankly, I cannot answer that question. They have4
not come here and told us why. They held the bill up to the Senate
in our last debate as having been considered at great length and hav-
ing been perfected as far as5 possible. They asked the Senate to sup-
port the bill as- a whole. It was iecommitted, and only that part of
the bill which the Senate approved ,has been left out of the bill.“ I do
not quite understand it. It was certain that section 2 was approved by
the Senate; it was certain that section 1 was disapproved. The ‘bill
was recommitted,7 and that portion which the Senate approved is
left in the committee and that portion which the Senate disapproved is
brought forward again, notwithstanding the vote of 628 to 17
against it. A

Mr. President, those are the facts. What is the explanation P. I con-
fess I cannot explain. It is possible that an explanation9 was made; but
if so, I did not hear it, and I do not know of anyone who has heard an
explanation. l

Mr. President, that is the situation with” regard to this matter. My
substitute is approved as an amendment by the chairman of the com-
mittee. It has been approved by the Senate, and it has all the support“
any man could wish for it. Yet we are met now with the argument
that it will not be considered unless we first agree that the dual system
shall be abolished” in advance. I

30’s] , I 125

,Mr. President, I do not profess to know anything about the dual
system or the single system. All in the World that»I ask is that the13
thing be investigated. Give me the facts. I hold no brief for either
side. That is all that my substitute calls for—a committee appointed
by the President to” investigate afgreat question and to inform the
Senate what the facts are. _

So I say I think that my proposition is reasonable. It has the ap-
proval of15 the chairman of the committee, and it has the approval of
the Senate by a formal vote. So I ask for its passage on its standing in
the Senate. I do not” remember a single amendment in the five years
that I have been here that came before the Senate with that amount of
approval.

But, Mr. President, that is not the" whole question. The United
States has a great stake in its merchant marine. I am not interested in
the prosperity of any_ particular shipping company;18 but I do want
‘to be sure that my country is properly defended in time of peace and
in time of war. We will agree that the Army is needed, we will
agree” that the Navy is needed, and I think we will also agree that
the great auxiliary of the Army and Navy is the American merchant
marine.”

WINSTON CHURCHILL (Continued)

Here‘ in these memorable days, I have found .an Olympian forti-
tude which, far from being based upon complacency, is only the mask
of an inﬂexiblel purpose and the proof of a sure, we1l—grounded conﬁ-
dence in the ﬁnal butcome.

’ We in Britain had the same feeling in our darkest days. We, too,
were sure that in the end2 all would be well. You do not, I am certain,
underrate the severity of the ordeal to which you and we have still
to be subjected. The forces ranged against us3 are enormous. They
are bitter. They are ruthless. The wicked men and their factions,
who have launched their peoples on "the path of war and conquest,
know that they will be called to terrible‘ account if they cannot beat
down by force of arms the peoples they have assailed.

They will stop at nothing. They have a vast accumulation of war

126 y [30’s

Weapons of all5 kinds. They have highly trained and disciplined
armies, navies, and air services. They have plans and designs which
have long been contrived and matured. They will stop at nothing that
violence6 and treachery can suggest. It is quite true that on our side
our resources in man power and materials are far greater than theirs.
But only a portion7 of your resources are as yet mobilized and devel-
oped, and we both of us have much to learn in the cruel art of war.

We have, therefore, without doubt, a time of8 tribulation before us.
In this same time ground will be lost which it will be hard and costly
to regain. Many disappointments and unpleasant surprises await us.
Many‘) of them will afﬂict us before the full marshaling of our latent
and total power can be accomplished.

For the best part of twenty years the youth of Britain and“) Amer-
ica have been taught that war was evil, which is true, and that it would
never come again, which has been proved false. For the best part of
twenty years the youth of Germany,“ Iapan, and Italy have been
taught that aggressive war is the noblest duty of the citizen and that it
should be begun as soon as the necessary weapons” and organization
have been made. We have performed the duties and tasks of peace.
They have plotted and planned for war. This naturally has placed us,
in Britain, and now” you, in the United States, at a disadvantage
which only time, courage, and untiring exertion can correct.

We have indeed to be thankful that so much time has“ been
granted us. If Germany had tried to invade the British Isles after the
French collapse in Iune, 1940, and if Japan had declared war on the
Empire” and the United States at about the same date, no one can
say what disasters and agonies might not have been our lot. But now
at the end of December,” 1941, our transformation from easygoing
peace to total war eﬂiciency has made very great progress.

The broad flow of munitions in Great Britain has" already begun.
Immense strides have been made in the conversion of American indus-
try to military. purposes; and now that the United States is at war,”
it is possible for orders to be given every day which in a year or

eighteen months hence will produce results in war power beyond any--

thing which has been” seen or foreseen in the dictator states. . . .
V Many people have been astonished that Japan should,’ in a single
day, have plunged into war against the United States and the iEmpire.2°

30’s] _ 127

We all wonder why, if this dark design, with its laborious and intri-
cate preparations, had been so long ﬁlling their secret minds, they did
not choose our moment” of weakness eighteen months ago.

Viewed quite dispassionately, in spite of the losses We have suf-
fered and the further punishment we shall have to take, it certainly
appears” an irrational act. It is, of course, only prudent to assume

that they have made very careful calculations, and think they see their
way through. (686 standard words) (Concluded in Par. I45)

144. High-Speed Take No. 32—Socia1 Security

Mr. President, ﬁrst, I desire to offer my apology to our distinguished
leader for my impatient acts and words to him.'I regret that I spoke
sol hastily and extremely. I dislike to add to his burdens in any way.
However, that is unimportant. I may have been inconsiderate, but a
rather2 serious question of fact has arisen on the floor of the Senate.
I realize that it is unfortunate that I am compelled to present this
pension measure in3 this way. But for three long years I have en-

. deavored to obtain a careful investigation of pensions by the Finance

Committee. For three long years this issue has not4 had the attention of
a committee in such a manner as to result in hearings. ‘

Failing in that, Mr. President, I succeeded in having a special com-
mittee5 appointed to investigate old—age pensions. That committee and
its members worked for months, and I accumulated voluminous data
from the Social Security6 Board. I hold in my hand letters and docu—
ments from them corroborating the ﬁgures which I have given to the
Senate.

Our distinguished leader tells me that over7 the telephone the Social
Security Board gave him totally diﬁerent ﬁgures. The distinguished
chairman of the Finance Committee states totally different’; ﬁgures
from mine. The distinguished senior Senator from Illinois began to
read aloud from the report of our special committee, in which it is said

128 [30’s

that the plan9 which that committee recommended would cost about
$3,600,000,000 a year. That plan was totally different from the one now
proposed. That plan“) called for social dividends for all persons not
gainfully employed; and our ﬁgures indicated that 10,000,000 persons
would be eligible for that kind of all pension, while only 3,000,000
people would be eligible on the basis of need.

So, when the Senator from Illinois stated that the ﬁgures therein ‘

are in” opposition to what I have said on the floor, he was reasonable,
but he was not accurate, because the ﬁgures given in the report apply
to a plan of13 social dividends and not to one based on actual need. '

The distinguished Senator from Georgia and I diﬂer radically

e upon another question.“ Ourtpeople are distressed to see the misery

and the insecurity of large numbers of our old people. I'do not believe
the American people will resent” our seeking some reasonable way
to alleviate suffering. The people of California will not do so, at least.

Mr. President, today, under” the Social Security Act, the workers
and employees of this Nation are paying over a billion dollars into the
pension fund. If others of us have to" be taxed a triﬂe more in order

to give old people a little more purchasing power, I am in favor of

doing so; and I say that the American” people want to do it. The

American people do not want to exist in a land where agriculture

Nevertheless, there may be another explanation. We know that for
many years past the policy of Japan has been dominated by secret
societies1 of subalterns .and junior officers of the army and navy who
have enforced their will upon successive Iapanese cabinets and parlia-
ments by the assassination‘? of any Iapanese statesman who opposed or
who did not sufficiently further their aggressive policies. It may be
that these societies, dazzled?’ .and dizzy with their ownschemes of
aggression and the prospect of early victory, have forced their country

30’s] 129

against its better judgment into war. They have certainly embarked‘
upon a very considerable anderta/(ing. \

After the outrages they have committed upon us at Pearl Harbor, in
the Paciﬁc islands, in the5 Philippines, in Malaya and the Dutch East
Indies, they must know that the stakes for which they have decided to
play are mortal. When we look at the resources of the United“ States
and the Empire, compared to those of Japan, when we remember
those of China, which have so long valiantly withstood invasion and
tyranny, and when also7 we observe the Russian menace which hangs
over Japan, it becomes more difﬁcult to reconcile Japanese action with
prudence or even with sanity. '

Whats kind of a people do they think we are? Is, it possible that
they do not realize that we shall never cease to persevere against them
until they have been taught a9 lesson which they and the world will
never forget?

M em hers of the Senate and M embers of the H ouse of Representatives,
I will turn for one moment more from the turmoil” and convulsions
of the present to the broader spaces of the future.

Here we are together facing a group of mighty foes who seek our
ruin. Here we are together“ defending all that to free men is dear.

Twice in a single generation the catastrophe of war has fallen
upon us. Twice in our lifetime has the long arm” of fate reached out
across the oceans to bring the United States into the forefront of the
battle. If we‘ had kept together after the last war, if we had ta/{enlg
common measures for our safety, this renewal of the curse need never
have fallen upon us. - '

Do we not owe it to ourselves, to our children, to tormented man-
kind,” to make sure that these catastrophes do not engulf us for the
third time? It has been proved that pestilences may break out in the
Old World which carry their destructive ravages” into the New
World from which, once they are afoot, the New World cannot escape.

Duty and prudence alike command, ﬁrst, that the germ centers of
hatred and revenge” should be constantly and vigilantly curbed and
treated in good time and that an adequate organization should be
set up to make sure that the pestilence can be” controlled at its earliest
beginning before it spreads and rages throughout the entire earth.

Five or six years ago it would have been easy without shedding a

130 . [30’s

drop of” blood for the United States and Great Britain to have insisted
on the fulﬁllment of the disarmament clauses of the treaties which
Germany signed after the Great” War.

And that also would have been the opportunity for assuring to
the Germans those raw materials, which we declared in the Atlantic
"Charter should not2° be denied to any nation, victor or vanquished.

The chance has passed. It is gone. Prodigious hammer strokes
have been needed to bring us together today. . . .

It is not given” to us to peer into the mysteries of the future. Still
I avow my hope and faith, sure and inviolate, that in the days to come
the British and American people” will for their own safety and for the
good of all walk together in ’majesty, in justice, and in peace. (679

149. High-Speed Take No. 33—Review

Mr. President, I am happy that, as a result of the prompt action the
Senate of the United States has taken today on the treaties submitted
by the1 President of the United States, time is still available to consider,
from the floor of the Senate, amendments to the legislation that was
introduced just2 before the last election.

In my judgment, the amendment of my friend, the junior Senator
from Michigan, to the pending bill for the economic relief of3 agricul«
ture is of interest not only to the citizens of his community but also to
the people of the United States in general. This amendment"‘ is fa-
vored by Repuhlicans and Democrats alike, both in the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate of the United States. It provides for in—

Building High Speed Through Reading. A desirable feature
of any shorthand course, whether elementary or advanced, is plenty of
reading and copying from printed shorthand plates. Abundant practice
of this type increases the student’s shorthand vocabulary, provides an
automatic review of the principles of Gregg Shorthand, and tends to
improve the student’s penmanship because of the constant reading and
copying of expertly written outlines.

Three types of material were selected for this practice——inspirational,
informational, and historical. The material covers a wide variety of
subjects, thus providing the student with the maximum opportunity
for vocabulary develo ment.

In Assignments 7 , 76, 78, 79, and 80, the “Building High Speed
Through Reading” sections have been written by “guest” writers who
have made a reputation as high—speed shorthand writers and who now

hold reporting or other positions requiring expert shorthand skill. .

‘These guest writers have written their takes in a regular Spiral—bound
reporter’s notebook, and those notebook pages have been photographed
and slightly reduced in order to get them on the text page. Thus the
.student has an opportunity to see how the writing of these experts
looks in a shorthand notebook.

Penmanship Drills. No penmanship drills have been woven into
the assignments in Expert S/zort/zrmd Speed Course. Assumably the
student has had training in penmanship before he reached his present
shorthand speed; and, consequently, his main penmanship problems
will be of a remedial nature.

On pages xi and xii of the textbook is a series of penmanship drills
covering the major joinings in Gregg Shorthand. When the student’s
daily reading back and written transcripts indicate a penmanship
deﬁciency, the proper drill should be selected from this series, for
remedial practice.

creased5. prices for farm products;,and it has the support of the chair-
man of the Committee on Agriculture, the chairman of the Appropria-
tions Committee and also,“ I am informed, of the President of the
United States, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Com-
merce.

I should explain that the inclusion7 of this amendment will mean
an expenditure from the Treasury of the United States of several mil-
lion dollars of the taxpayers’ money, but bear in8 mind that it will in-
crease considerably the purchasing power and add to the general pros-
perity of the average farmer. It will be an amount of9 money well
spent. It seems to me that in the present emergency the Federal Gov-
ernment is justiﬁed in passing legislation to carry out this program.”

I hope that, as a result of the facts that will be brought up in the
debate, those Members on both sides of the aisle who at the present
moment are against this appropriation“ may change their minds. The
passage of the pending bill as amended by the junior Senator from
Michigan will mean the establishment of a bureau that will” probably
require about ten civil service employees to carry on the work. The
President of the United States will appoint an administrator, who will”
have the responsibility for organizing the bureau. His compensation
will be $10,000 a year. As a practical matter, it might be wise for”
the administrator of this new bureau to have his oﬂices in the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, as he will have to work pretty closely with the
Secretary” of Agriculture. If the Department of Agriculture cannot
provide space, however, I am informed that oﬂices are available in
other buildings” owned by the National Government in the District
of Columbia.‘ In any case, that problem need not concern Members of
the Senate at this moment. I

While I am” on the ﬂoor, let me give you a complete picture of
this legislation. Several years ago, shortly after the election in which
the constituents of my18 community sent me to the House of Repre-
sentatives, the gentleman from New York and I brought up a similar
bill which, in my judgment, would have helped agriculture” without
involving too great an expense to the Treasury of the United States.
The amount of money called for at that time was $100 million. But
after” several hearings, at which taxpayers were heard for and against
the legislation, the committee reduced the amount to $50 million.

132 [30’s

Under those“ circumstances, the membership of the Senate and of the
House of Representatives passed the bill and had reason to believe that
the President of the United States Would” sign it. From time to time
in the past he had shown interest in legislation that would establish
such a bureau in the Federal Government. He gave notice, l’lOWCVCI‘,23
that he was against the bill because he observed in it a number of
unwise regulations and limitations as Well as several- provisions which
Would24 not pass the Supreme Court of the United States. I

I pointed out that, unless those limitations and provisions were
taken out, the American people in general25 would not approve such
legislation. Enough Republicans joined the Democrats in the House
to override the veto; ‘but, in the Senate, the Republicans succeeded” in
stopping a Vote on the Veto by passing a resolution to refer the bill to
the Committee on Agriculture. I am informed that the chairman” of
the committee let the legislation die by not presenting it on the floor
of the House until that session of Congress expired.

Before bringing up the present” pending bill, I had a conference‘

with the President of the United States,’ and he has promised to. sup-
port the legislation if the unwise provisions to‘ which” he objected
some years ago were removed. For the purpose of the record, I want to
establish the fact that the economic value of the pending legislation“
will not be weakened in any way by the elimination of those provi—
sions. In other words, in its present form the pending bill will carry
out the plan to31 relieve agriculture and at the same time meet the
standards of the President of the United States. I haveevery reason to
believe that this legislation,” with the amendments of the junior Sena-

‘tor from Michigan, will pass the Supreme Court of the United States.

Many of my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats,” agree
that of the vast accumulation of bills brought up from time to time on
the floor of the Senate to bring prosperity to agriculture in the smaller“
communities, the pending bill is the most promising. Every Senator
who votes for'the bill will be renderinga real service not only to agri-
culture35 in general but also to all the people of the United States.

In my judgment, Mr. President, the Congress of the United States
has not considered” more important‘ legislation since it debated the
resolution offered by the senior Senator from Illinois and the senior
Senator from Texas a37 few years ago to regulate increases in wages

151. High-Speed Take No. 34—Federal Projects

Mr. Speaker, later on I shall yield 30 minutes to the minority rep-
resentative of the Committee on Rules, the gentleman from Illinois,
or to1 any other minority member of the Committee on Rules who may
desire time.

Mr. Speaker, this is the same bill that the House passed in the last
session of Congress.2 As I understand, it was agreed to by the con-
ferees; but, unfortunately, during the last day or so of the sessions of
the other body the bill was3 not called ap and failed to pass. I do not
wish to be understood as criticizing the gentlemen in the other body,
because I never do; I only -call4 attention to the situation.

This bill contains 291 projects. The total amount authorized is $300
million. Of the entire amount,5 so far as I have been able to ascertain,
only $13 million is urgent and required by the Army and the Navy at

' this time. As to most of the“ amounts authorized in the bill, there is

no real urgency; and no appropriation need be made at this time.

Mr. Speaker, just as I started to speak, I was7 interrupted by a point
of order which was made in good faith, I know, by the minority leader.

I know that the minority leader has the well-being and the8 interest
of his party at heart, and that. was the reason he made the point of
order. He did not wish to deprive the membership on that side, and
even many on9 this side who were not present, of listening to informa-
tion and the presentation of the cause of the great river and harbor
bill. _

So I have been trying to impart” this information‘ to the member-
ship of the House. The rule is an open rule. It provides for two hours’
general tleoate and makes in order the Senate bill, as“ I stated before,

which was unanimously agreed to by the conferees in the last session

134 [30’s

and passed by the House. As I stated, it provides for 29112 projects at
a cost of $300 million, but only $13 million of this amount need be
appropriated at this time. I am informed” that other projects should
not receive appropriation: until actually needed for war purposes. This
bill includes nearly all those matters that the original“ bill provided
for. The only exception is the Central Valley project of California,
which has been taken out of the bill.

I am pleased that, due to the” intelligence and hard work of our
Democratic colleague from Illinois, a member of that committee, and
due to the efforts of a new member from Illinois,” provision has been
made for three projects in the great State of Illinois, which are actu-
ally needed. I congratulate both of these gentlemen on the splendid
work they" have done in bringing about the adoption of these projects.

This would have been impossible, however, had it not been for the
able, intelligent, and hard—Working18 chairman of the Committee on
Rivers and Harbors, the young man who has reached the age of
eighty—four, who before he became chairman of the Committee on
Rivers and” Harbors, was forimany years a member of that commit-
tee, and who has been in public life for 57 years. I hope he willremain
with us for many more years.2°

IT WAsN’T MY FAULT

Returning from a recent journey, I left the railway station with so
reckless a taxi driver that I had to ask him to stop and let me Walk

home. All my remonstrancesl had proved in vain, and I preferred

ambulation to an ambulance. “You’re going to have a bad accident
some day,” I warned the driver; and we parted.

Four or2 ﬁve blocks farther along, I found the taxi half on the side-
walk. Recognizing me, the driver rushed over to explain that this was
due to our system of signals. “The3 red light ﬂashed so quick I couldn’t
stop,” he said, “and I had to turn up here or hit another car.”

The ability to look one’s self in the eye and admit, “That was‘ my

. own fault,” demands courage and introspective integrity. Can you

remember ever witnessing a collision in which both motorists did not
protest that they5 had the right of way? Or have you ever directed

V 303] 135

attention to bad work or a blunder without being told that the respon-
5z'17z'lz'ty rested elsewhere?

A friend“ of mine has a cook he calls Alibi Agnes. If the meat is
overdone, she blames the oven; when she arrives late in the morning,
it’s because the streetcar brokedown. The7 idea that she might have
made allowance for flaws in a stove or delays ‘never occurred to her.

A personnel manager of a big shop told me that he divides all8 its
employees into two classes: those who never make mistakes, and those
who make them’ rarely. “Of course,” he explains, “there is no such ani-

mal as I have grouped in the ﬁrst9 class. These are merely the people .

who never admit a failing or a failure. Since no one can correct what
doesn’t exist, they are beyond hope of improvement or” advancement.
The men or women who say, ‘Yes, I did that, and I’ll try not to do it
again,’ compose the second class; and they are the clerks who get ahead.
Believe it or not,“ we once raised the salary of a girl who replied to a
complaining customer, ‘That was stupid of me.’ We felt she had what
it takes to proﬁt by eXperience.”12

An extremelyvlarge share of success in every ﬁeld is due to such
plucky and honest" self—scrutiny. The superintendent of one of the
largest apartment” buildings in New York told me, “I began as a
house painter, and pretty much everything I did had to be done over
again. I always blamed my brushes, or paint,” or the wood, or the
weather, until I got wise to myself, and said, ‘All the brushes and all
the paint in the world can’t be wrong; maybe there’s a chance that
I’m wrong.’ The following” Saturday I gave up painting and found
something I could do.”

That’s one way. Another is that of a prominent attorney in the
Middle West. When he started practicing” years ago, he lost most
of his cases. Instead of blaming the judges _or his clients, he “cross-
examined” himself. “I decided that, however much I knew” of law,
I knew far too little of everything else. I got another job, enrolled in
a night class at a local college, and prescribed for myself a year’s gen-
eral” reading. After that, I went back to law, and, as you see, I’m
doing well.”

It is the most natural thing on earth that we should like to be
patted on the shoulder, but” it is a mistake to do all our own patting
and attribute the necessity to the blindness or bias of the rest of hu-

A 136 [l30’,s r

manity. An acquaintance who has lost” ﬁve positions in the last three
months has given me various reasons, but none of them have to do
with any shortcomings in him. He may be providing himself With”
self-conﬁdence; but it would be more helpful to conclude, “Employ-
ers just don’t ﬁre desirable assistants. What’s the matter with me, and
What can I do about it?”

The man” who seeks a whipping boy for every mishap or misfor-
tune is only whipping himself. If I write what I deeply believe—that
about 90 per cent of so—called23 bad luck is attributable to ourselves
——I shall get dozens or hundreds of letters of protest. It would be inter-
esting to learn how large a proportion of the24 writers have gone on
having bad luck, and how large a proportion of those who blame them-
selves have less reason now for blaming anybody.

154. High-Speed Take No. 35—Antitrust Legislation

Mr. President, if I may have the attention of the Senate for only a

few minutes, I promise not to trespass unreasonably upon its patience.

We1 all know that last Iune the Supreme Court of the United States
held that the insurance business came within the interstate—commerce
clause of the Constitution, and that therefore2 the Clayton Act and the
Sherman Antitrust Act were applicable to such business.

Mr. President, an effort was made by Senators and Representatives,3
while this case was pending in the Supreme Court, to enact legislation
which would have exempted the insurance business from the Sherman
and Clayton Acts. However, the4 legislation which had been sub-
mitted was not adopted by the Senate, although, I believe, it was
adopted by the House. Since the decision of the Supreme C ourt,5 legis-

303] 137

lation has been initiated in both Houses of the Congress to void in
one way or another the Supreme C ourt’s decision. I feel that the adop-
tion6 of the conference report which embodies such legislation would
have the effect of weakening the Supreme Court's decision. That is
the exact point to which I wish7 to address myself.

I am not complaining about any other provision of the conference
report. In other sections of the conference report it is8 provided that
the States shall have the power to regulate and tax the business of insur-
ance. I am not complaining about that. In another part of the confer—
ence9 report it is provided that there shall be a moratorium on the ap-
plicability of the antitrust laws to the business of insurance until”
January 1, 1948. In ot/zer words, none of the four Federal acts would
be applicable to the business of insurance until Ianuary 1,11 1948. That
would be a considerably longer time than the President would prefer,
but I am not complaining even about a three—year period.” There is
considerable justification for the States being given an opportunity to
modify their laws respecting the insurance business sol?’ that they shall
not be in conflict with the four Federal laws enumerated in the provi-
sion to which I have referred. But I do object, Mr. President, to” the
provision, which I read, providing that for all future time the antitrust
laws shall not apply to the business of insurance except in a State

‘ which has not” regulated the insurance business.

Mr. President, if that language had contained‘ the limitation that
the State regulation, in order to be valid, must not” be inconsistent
with the Clayton Act or the Sherman Act, I should have no objection
to it. But under the language which I have read, and to which I am
addressing” my criticism, the State would be given the right to deter-
mine to what degree those laws were applicable to the business of
insurance.

In a recent letter” to me, the President of the United States indi-
cates the point I am trying to make at the present time; namely, that
he thought it was proper to give the insurance” companies time to
readjust themselves to the decision of the Supreme Court and give the
States time to adjust their laws so they would conform to the antitrust

laws.2°

WHAT STAR SHALL GUIDE OUR COUNTRY?

Today there is an increasing need for all of us to think clearly and

realistically.

Innumerable plans for the future are in the making by business1
and government. And we hear much of a brave new world served by
scientiﬁc marvels of every kind.

But with all the worth-while gains that will be made, the days that
are to2 come will also bring. formidable problems, problems that will
affect the lives of every one of us. ' ’

]obs must be found—good jobs—for all who want to work.

Means must be provided3 to keep in operation some at least of the
vast war plants in which so much private and public money is invested.

Continuing high taxes, a staggering‘ public debt, and the upward
pressure on prices——all must be faced.

These problems will not solve themselves. A few new laws, formu-
las, or theories will not cause them to disappear.5

For these are personal problems . . -. and as such they are the per-
sonal responsibility of every one of us. Out of the courage and good
sense and fundamental“ decency of 130,000,000 Americans, the all-
important answers must be forged.

What speciﬁcally, then, can we, as individual Americans,7 do to
help solve these problems?

We can exercise our franchise intelligently and vote for the ablest
and most conscientious public servants and representatives.8

We can obey the law in letter and in spirit, thus helping to set
an example of stability for the entire world.

We can pay our debts and spend9 our money carefully and wisely
to keep prices down, for the ﬁnancial health of the nation depends
upon the ﬁnancial health of its citizens.

We can deliver” honest value in our business or at our job, and
thereby contribute to lasting prosperity.

We can support our religious institutions, which are fundamenta
in the moral life of the community. '

We can be tolerant of other races, other ideas and beliefs, while we
hold fast to our American” ideals.

111

C

30’s] 139

And last but not least, we can take interest and pride in our family
life.

It isin the home that character is bred and nourished. Our homes
should be the fountainhead” of honor and decency.

With the youth of America lie our hopes. If a better America is
to be built, they must build it. To this great task they must” bring
strength and courage and determination and all the inspiration we can
give them.‘ _

The history of our country is a history of united struggle . . . of15
dangers and difﬁculties faced together and ‘overcome. In her hour of
need, America has always found the answers to her problems in the
mind: and hearts of her” people.

It is there she must look for the answers today.—Fora' M otor Com-

HEARING

The layman little appreciates the importance of acute hearing to
the shorthand writer. Yet, of the mechanical diﬂiculties that the re-
porter must. overcome, the question of‘ hearing is perhaps foremost,
and the one over which he /_za5 the least control. The average person
who is listening to an oration, to dialogue on the stage, or to a witness
-.speaking2 from the stand isrbarely conscious of slurred words or lost
syllables. He is dealing in ideas, not in words. If he can comfortably
follow the thought of the speaker, he is not conscious of the3 little
connective words that become lost in the shuffle. If you were to ask
him after the meeting how much of it he heard, he would probably
aﬂirm without hesitation that he had heard‘ every word of it; whereas,
as a matter of fact, he probably missed from ﬁve to ten words out of
every hundred.

But the reporter, whose duty it is to follow the speaker, to catch
every5 word as it falls from his lips and translate it into shorthand,
will tell you that, although his position was close to the front of the
room, he missed perhaps two words out of ahundred. Notwithstand-
ing6 the fact that his hearing is even more acute—undoubtedly more
highly trained to hear separate words—than that of the average lis—
tener, yet he frequently ﬁnds it impossible either7 to hear or to com-
prehend each word spoken. -

This problem of hearing is so vitally important that it should be
given special consideration by the young shorthand reporter. There is

’ probablys little that he can do to improve the organ in a purely physi-

cal way, outside of caring for it according to the most approved
methods of hygiene. But by his method of shorthand9 practice and by
concentrating on the matter, he can so train his ear that its .defects
will be minimized. I

Perhaps the sense of hearing is the least acute of all our senses. This
is not so in” the lower animals, whose hearing is sometimes developed
to an uncanny degree.  the other hand, our keenness of eyesight
today far outstrips that either of primitive man or of the“ animals.
With the progress of civilization, we have more and more depended
on our sight, with the consequent development of that organ to its
present high degree. To that same extent” our hearing has been neg-

TEACHING PROCEDURES

Theory Review. This review list_ should be disposed of very
quickly at the beginning of the period, as it is intended for rapid recall
of material with which the student is already familiar. No new learn—

ing is involved. The following procedure should dispose of the list in

two or three minutes:

1. Write the Words in line oz on the blackboard, one outline at a
time, and have the entire class read in concert each outline as you
write it. '

2. After the entire line is on the blackboard, point to the outlines
rapidly and at random, as the entire class reads in concert.

3. Repeat this procedure for lines b, e, and d.

4. After the entire drill is on the blackboard, review the entire list
in concert, pointing rapidly and at random to outlines from all four

lines of the drill.

(Note: It is not necessary to dictate the words to the students after the black-
board drill has been completed.)

High-Speed Shortcuts. All the high—speed shortcuts used in
Expert S/zort/zcma’ Speed Course are introduced in the first twenty-one
assignments. The shortcuts are introduced at the rate of about ﬁve or
six to an assignment, so as not to place too great a burden on the
student’s mind. Every measure should be taken to insure that the
students learn the shortcuts thoroughly, as half-learned shortcuts are
a great hazard to the attainment of shorthand speed.

The following procedure is recommended for the initial presenta-
tion of the shortcuts:

1. Select a portion of your blackboard space on which to place the
high—speed shortcuts and derivatives that accompany each group of
shortcuts at the beginning of the period, and leave them there for the

greater trust in an impression received through the eyes than by means
of the ear. Many, indeed,” cannot grasp a distinctly oral impression,
but must have it transmitted through the eyes before it is completely
and fully comprehended.

But the oral impression is the only one that the shorthand“ writer
receives. He must get his whole impression from the sound of the
voice. Furthermore, he must catch each word as it falls—or enough
of each Word to identify it for what it is and what it” means.

HEARING (Concluded)

Sometimes a good speaker will deliberately slur over a word simply
for oratorical effect, leaving the unhappy reporter stumped for a mo-
ment while the talker goes merrilyl on with his oration. Of course,
the reporter eventually gets the word in the same manner that the
ordinary listener gets it—from the context as the speaker proceeds. But

perhaps2 by that time the reporter is ten, ﬁfteen, or more words behind,"

which calls for an extra spurt of speed to catch up. If he is fortunate
enough to command that extra spurt, why, no harm is done3——unless,
perchance, another word is missed in the meantime! The possibilities
are very interesting. This is just one more proof of the need, so oftsn

reiterated, of being able4 to handle the mechanical problems of short-
hand automatically, the better to concentrate on the more elusive one
-of hearing. , K t

Your application of principles in writing the5 common run of
matter should be absolutely mechanical. Needless to say, if you have
to‘think consciously all the time of outlines, phrasing, and such mat-
ters, your hearing will be necessarily“ less acute than ever, because it
is less alert. Hearing is the one element in shorthand that cannot, as
a rule, be carried on mechanically. Emergencies will always be7 aris-
ing in connection with it that we never have to meet in the more
mechanical routine of recalling outlines; hence, the necessity of favor-
ing it in all your practice.

To this end,8 every bit of practice that you do, every word that
you add to your vocabulary, every item of information that comes
into your possession is a contribution to9 solving the problem of hear-
ing. The smaller, more common words, mostly of one or two sylla-
bles, would be the hardest of all to hear, because of the unconscious
manner in which they are slurred in all” speech, were it not for t/.ze
fact that they are so common. A word that is familiar to us is, by
reason of its familiarity, usually readily grasped even though part of
it may” become lost in transmission.

This is especially true if we are not engrossed in the mechanics of
shorthand but are following the context and the thought of the subject
we are reporting. The” word may be slurred, it may be amputated

~at the front or at the rear—it may be completely lost sometimes—.but,
because we have met it so often before in just such context, we recog— l

nize it” instantly. It is when we meet the unusual word, or the
familiar_ word in a new dress—in some unusual combination, or mas-
querading under a strange pronunciation——that14 our ears are put to
the test. Even if the word is distinctly articulated, if we are not alert,
very frequently we miss it. If we are properly set, as we should be,
to meet just” such an emergency, we will recognize the word from the
context and properly label it in our notes. But if we have not been
concentrating on either the hearing or the context, the word” is lost
forever.

Sometimes, of course, the context is of no help, in which emergency

you should write the sounds phonetically, as you hear them, depending
on your own method of research to supply” the word later, in tran-
scribing. In case the word is slurred by the speaker, and you are wholly
uncertain of its phonetics, even ‘then an effort should be made to write

exactly what you heard, sense” or no sense. Do not leave a blank..

Write something, encircling it or identifying it in some manner in
‘your notes—and more often than not, in transcribing, a single correct
syllable that” you have caught will give you the clue to what was said.
As a last resort, if you cannot reconstruct the word, but ifiyou have
been following the thought of the speaker, the surrounding context
will enable2° you to supply an adequate substitute, and no great harm
will be done.—The Technique of Shorthand Reporting, by Charles L.

TACT THAT HoLDs PEOPLE

During butter rationing in the World War, I was in a store where
the customers were huﬂing and pufling against the restrictions. The
clerk at the dairy counter told each customer he could have only1 half
a pound of butter. '

A few days later I was in Jim Walsh’s store. When I asked Jim
for butter, he smiled and said, “We can let you have as much as half‘
a pound.” That sounded like a lot more than2 “only half a pound.”

‘ Wanted to cut down on the overhead costs per sale. He set up a limi-

tation on the size of the piece goods?’ to be sold. The ﬁrst few weeks
this backﬁred and cut into sales volume. Investigation showed this
unexpected result was due to the way the sales girls gave this informa-
tion to the customers.“ ' '

“You can’t buy less than a yard,” they were telling customers. That
was negative. -

They were instructed to say, “You can buy as little as one yard.”
That produced a change in the customers’ attitude toward5 the limi-

If you wished to ask a favor, would you depend upon your dignity
and position, or a smile? ,

The ﬁsh-market boy, reared in the slums, who became the first citi-

ease trying situations. During hearings on a bill for the appointment,
solely by the Governor, of an important board one speaker raised7

» strong objection.

“We should have a provision to make sure that both political parties
will be represented on this board,” he urged.
“I don’t think that is necessary,” replied former Governors Smith,
a Democrat. The hearing chamber was tense; this seemed like the
start of a ﬁght. But the Governor went on, “There is no danger of
my appointing a commission made up entirely of” Republicans!” There
was nothing epoch making about this joke, but it tactfully paved the
way for a nonpartisan board. Al Smith won many of his victories over
opposition by this tactful” use of smile words.

THE STEADYING INFLUENCE 01: WORK

It is, perhaps, fortunate for the happiness and well—being of the
World in which we move and live that work is necessary for our exist-
-ence. If, for a moment, we try to visualize1 a land freed from this
necessity, a land Where everything would come to us without effort
on our part, We should quickly realize that, in a very short space of
time, all of us would become2 weary of living. There would be no
‘pleasure in doing anything, for the secret of pleasure lies in the effort
-of achievement. The whole basis of civilization would crumble. We3
should become unbalanced and unstable. Our equilibrium would be
lost, and We should be heading for disaster.

At times we may grumble at work, we may say to ourselves that
the distribution4 of labor seems unfair, that so many are forced to work
so much harder than others. We may be inclined to murmur against
routine, wondering why our hours of employment cannot be more
varied.5 Possibly most of us feel like this at times. The remedy, of
course, lies with ourselves.

Work is definitely necessary for the well—being of the individual.’

It is a steadying6 inﬂuence on the conduct of his life. It is responsible
for bringing him the wherewithal to enjoy his leisure hours, to indulge
in his particular hobby. Furthermore, if he has a7 bit of self—respect,
he will derive much pleasure from carrying out his duties to the very
best of his ability.

Work is what one makes it. It can be dull and colorless, looked
‘tuporis merely as a necessary evil to be cast aside at the ﬁrst moment
possible. On the other hand, it can be turned into a daily adventure,
a game to be played with enthusiasm” and spirit, something to be
enjoyed and appreciated to the full. Without the incentive to progress
—which implies work or effort—there would be little object in living.

EXECUTIVE TRAINING FOR YOUNG MEN

Not long ago a redheaded, grinning oﬂice boy stood on a table and
entertained eighty other members of what is known as'the Iuniors’
Organization with an imitation of George1 A. Martin, the company’s
president. The boy’s efforts were greeted with hearty laughter. Mar-
tin’s mannerisms, his peculiarities of speech, his changing facial expres-

‘sions, his gestures, were2 all faithfully reproduced.

A company oﬂicial, watching the performance from another room,

chuckled and reported what he had seen to Mr. Martin himself. The .

president was silent3 for a moment and then muttered, half .to him-
self, “I must see that at the next meeting.”

When the Juniors met again Mr. Martin was present. At the con-
clusion of the meeting he arose and said,4 “I want to see that take-oﬁ
on myself—that young redhead over there does it.” And he pointed
an accusing ﬁnger in the direction of a lad who by then was looking
desperately, around5 him for the nearest exit.

“Come on, ‘young man,” the president commanded, “get up on that
table and show-me to myself—as I look to you.”

The youth was quaking, but orders were orders and this order‘;
had come from the big boss himself. Reluctantly he climbed on the
table. '

But he did his stuff, and did it well; and Mr. Martin laughed as

.148 ' [35’s

he recalled the incident. “It was the best imitation7 I ever saw of
anyone. I complimented the youngster and told him that if he would
be equally observant on his own job, he might become president of the
company and enjoys seeing himself imitated by one of his own olﬁce
boys. . . ’

“I am interested in that lad just as much as I am interested in every
other young man in our organization.9 Perhaps I am more interested
in the redhead than in some of the others. I’d say he has brought him-
self rather forcibly to my attention. If he stays with this organization,”
and works, he will become, in not so many years, an important execu-
tive. That is not a prediction. It is a fact.

“How could it be otherwise? Consider his equipment, his powers
of” observation, his courage. I’m certain he has courage. He’s not
very old—still in his teens—'and I know it required courage for him
to climb on that table and imitate me before nearly a12 hundred other
young men and myself. He has the ability to observe. Observation
demands attentiveness, and attentiveness is a fairly positive indication
of ‘an ability” to think. It isn’t expecting too much of him to predict
that some day he will be occupying, ﬁguratively, the chair in which I
am sitting. ‘

“If I were a young man again, just” starting in life, my ﬁrst step
would be this: I’d ﬁnd a job in a big corporation. I know from expe-
rience that the average young man—and by average I mean average
in everything,” in inclination to work, in study, in ambition, and in
desire——by starting out with a big corporation and staying with it, is
99 per cent likely to wind up as an” important executive of the same
ﬁrm. . ,

“Nor does it matter where he starts, in the factory or in the oﬂice.
The ﬁrst requisite is to start, and the second requisite is to stick. On
the way" upward pride takes many a wallop; but, bolstered by deter—
mination, it will carry on. In the course of thirty—ﬁve years with this
company my own pride has takengmany severe buﬁ'etings.18 There
have been plenty of times when I wanted to quit, plenty of times when
pride demanded that I quit. My predecessor in the presidency of this

2. Place the first shortcut on the blackboard, telling the students its
meaning. »

3. Have the entire class read the shortcut in concert.

4. Place the second shortcut on the blackboard, telling the students
its meaning. -

5. Have the entire class read this second shortcut.

6. Then have the entire class reread both shortcuts that are on the
blackboard.

7. Repeat this procedure until the ﬁve or six shortcuts are on the
blackboard, reviewing in concert all the shortcuts that are on the
blackboard at the time.

8. Next, have one or two students read the shortcuts as you point
to them at random.

9. Dictate the entire list of shortcuts to the students once, having
them write the outlines for them in their notebooks. ‘

This procedure shouldtake about two or three minutes.

In presenting the shortcut derivatives that follow each group of
shortcuts, use the following procedure: V

1. Write each derivative on the blackboard, having the class read
each form as you write it. In most cases, the students will be able
to read the derivatives without your assistance, as they have already
learned the primitive. If, however, there is not even one student who is
able to read the derivative immediately, give the meaning to the
class without delay. a

2. Place each natural group on the blackboard, as the class reads

in concert before rereadin . For exam le when resentin the deriva-.

tives in paragraph 4 of Expert S/zort/zand Speed Course, place the
outlines inform, informs, informing, uninformed on the blackboard
as a group before rereading; then place the outlines for productive,
product, products, produce, produced, and producer on the blackboard
as a group before rereading. ‘

3. When the entire list is on the blackboard and has been drilled
on in concert, have one or two students read back as you point at
random. ,

It is not necessary to dictate these derivatives to the students.

After the high—speed shortcuts and derivatives have been presented .

is to learn a list of shortcuts, practice some phrases, and then by having
an experienced reporter whisper a magic word in their car they will
acquire the status of2 a reporter. It isnot done that way, it never was
done that way, and if we may presume to forecast the future, it never
will be done that way. Reporting requires less outside assistance and
more3 individual effort than almost any other endeavor that can be
named. Scarcely any other craft or profession possesses such a delicate
co—ordination of skill and4 experience that comes only with personal
and individual practice. Instruction is, of course, essential; advice and
encouragement are important and helpful; but‘ the one absolutely5
indispensable requisite to reporting skill is the capacity of the student
for serious, concentrated eﬁfort on his own behalf.

A few schools today teach reporting and“ graduate satisfactory re-
porting talent directly from the classroom to the court, but the vast

' majority of practicing reporters today acquired their skill solely on

their own initiative.7 Some of them never had an hour’s personal in-
struction after they learned the system, but they did possess ambition
and the capacity to work by themselves without guidance. Many8 of
them did not at the beginning have the essential education for the job;
but that, too, they acquired by the same singleness of purpose and

_ effort that they applied to the job of speed9 building.

What we wish to stress is that, by whatever means they are ac—
quired, reporting skill and knowledge are not a mushroom growth.
Any student who directs his ambition toward that goal must recon-
cilem himself or herself to many months of personal practice and
effort, with little or no help from outside sources. The shorthand speed
that he must acquire will come only by the speed practice that he“
himself must do, and not what somebody else talks or writes about.
The knowledge and the experience that are equally a part of the job
he must pack in his own head, by his own reading and his” own
processes of mental digestion. Book learning, so called, will help; but
common observation and a general knowledge of many things will do
a great deal more——such an education as is13 picked up by an alert, in-
quiring mind which gleans for itself rather than accepts perfunctorily
the mental labors of others. Reporting skill is essentially a combination

. of mental” alertness and manual dexterity, plus the co—ordination that

152 - [35’s

makes the two a practical instrument of recording, a coordination that
is the result of personal,” individual exercise and nothing else.

The ﬁrst essential, of course, to reporting skill is shorthand speed.
Since reporting is the rapid writing of speech, the mere mechanical
ability” to write fast is the basis of all reporting ability; and almost
any eﬂcort on the part of the ambitious student directed toward improv-
ing his speed capabilities is” an effort in the right direction. There
is no substitute for speed practice. (609 standard words) (Concluded

TRAINING 1:011 SHORTHAND REPORTERS (Concluded)

Some reporters have acquired their initial skill by following, month
in and month out, a rigid program of writing from dictation——a
monotonous routine of writing and reading back for hours1 at a time,
day after day, with no other guide to their training but their native
intelligence and the texts on shortcuts and phrases.

Dictation has a twofold value as a means to reporting2 skill. It is
the backbone of speed work; but it is also an important item in devel-
oping that all—round knowledge and vocabulary so essential to the
reporter. When we use the?’ term “dictation” in connection with speed
work, we have in mind a dictation program designed to embrace a
wide variety of material, such a program as will provide shorthand

35’s] 153

practice on‘ all the words and phrases that the reporter will be likely
to meet in average work. Such dictation cannot and should not be
restricted to one type of material or to one subject matter.5 It must
provide the widest possible range of subject and terminology; other-
wise it is useless for speed building or for any other purpose. Speed
building in its simplest terms is“ nothing more nor less than the ac-
quiring of a wide and ready vocabulary, plus the manual skill and

muscular co-ordination to reproduce such vocabulary instantly7 into

shorthand symbols. The wider the shorthand vocabulary, the greater
the resultant shorthand speed; also, incidentally, the wiser the head
that contains such vocabulary.

Its is impossible to follow such a routine of dictation practice with-
out at the same time adding to mental capacity. An improved short-
hand vocabulary of necessity9 induces an enhanced English vocabu-
lary. A shorthand outline or phrase is but a picture of its English
equivalent; to know one is to know and understand the other. Word
sense, or the“) ability to assess and discriminate between similar ex-
pressions, is also a product of such a routine of training, to say nothing

_ of a growing familiarity with“ English grammar and diction. But,

above all, there comes that smattering of information on many sub—
jects that is so helpful to a practicing reporter. Of necessity, in any
such routine” of subject matter after subject matter passing through
the brain channels, some of it is bound to “stick” as gleanings of
information and knowledge; and it is these continual deposits that
help” to make the reporter not only the capable artisan that he is, but

usually the u/ell-informed student of practical education that he

must be.

Thus the striving for reporting” skill is in itself an all—round prac-
tical education and an effort not to be undertaken lightly or by one
lacking in mental endurance. The advantages to be derived“ from
such a training are distinctly worth while. But before one reaches the
goal, many hours and months must be spent in a weary routine of dic-

tation and word—building practice. That is why, for every thousand”

or more shorthand writers in the country, there is but one shorthand

reporter. Only a few ever reach the goal of reporting, and those who
do reach it are usually those, not necessarily” of greater intelligence or"

greater ambition, but those who can depend upon their own efforts,

189. High-Speed Take No. 44—Review

Mr. Speaker, like my colleagues in the House, I receive on an aver-
age about 100 letters a day. Some are from taxpayers in general; some
are from constituents; some are from Civil1 Service employees who
have been in the service of the Government of the United States for
many years. A few moments ago I ﬁnished reading the mail that
accumulated while I2 was absent from the District of Columbia, in the
interests and in the service of the constituents of my community. The
letters discuss various government departments and3 bureaus, including
the Treasury Department, the Department of fustice, the Civil Service
Commission, and the Supreme Court.

I notice from many of the letters that the people of the United“
States are showing more and more interest in the coming elections.
The average citizen wants to know our attitude on the ever—increasin g
number of Federal bureaus that have5 been established in the past few
years. He wants to know whether the affairs of the National Govern-
ment could not be carried on with fewer bureaus and with more econ-
omy. He wants to know one whom to place the responsibility for the
ever-increasin g appropriations from the Treasury of the United States
being- made by the Congress of the United _States. As Members7 of the
House of Representatives, we must face the facts. In other words, We
must cut the expenses of government in this emergency or find our
constituents voting against us in the8 coming election.

Many of the letters show deﬁnite interest on the part of the Ameri-

can people in the new emergency regulations established by the Secre-

tary9 of Agriculture to maintain the purchasing power and the wages
of those engaged in agriculture. Many Democrats as well as many
Republicans have written me; and, in my jud gment,1° both sides bring
up pertinent facts and information bearing on the matter. Some take
the position that the regulations have many limitations and that pur—
chasing power and prosperity” will be reduced as a result of them;
others feel that the Secretary of Agriculture could take no other action
under the circumstances,‘ still others say that this is a matter” for the

35%] 155

House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States to con-
sider and enact legislation to take care of the matter. Still others point
out that the President of” the United States has the power to appoint
an administrator to cope with the matter.

In view of all the interest that has been shown in these regulations,
I agree with the gentleman” from Illinois and the gentleman from
Massachusetts that my friend, the chairman of the Committee on
Agriculture, should provide some time on the floor of the House for
general debate of15 the matter. The chairman of the. committee is
pretty well informed of the feelings of the people of the United States
on these regulations. From time to time in the past he has pointed
out” to the Secretary of Agriculture the practical problems they would
involve.

Another _constituent Writes to ask me to explain the reason why an
amendment to the Federal” Constitution was not passed many years
ago giving the House of Representatives a voice in making treaties. I
am sure I need not remind you that, when the Constitution of the »
United” States was framed, it provided that only the Senate of the
United States shall have treaty—mal{ing powers. My constituent feels
that this provision is unwise and that Members of the H ouse19 as Well
as Members of the Senate should be consulted when a treaty is consid-
ered. Members of the House must come up for election every two years,
while Members of the Senate come up for2° election every six years.
In other words, Members of the House are closer to the people of the
United States; and, consequently, when a treaty is brought up for con-
sideration, they21 have a pretty fair understanding of the feelings of th
people. i '

It seems to me that this is an appropriate time for an amendment
of this type to the Federal Constitution; and I22 hereby serve notice
that the gentleman from Connecticut, the gentleman from Louisiana,
and I will oﬁcer a resolution to have the proper committee draw up
practical” legislation that will enable the House of Representatives to
share the responsibility of treaty makin g. Some Members of the House
point out that Senators, whether they are Republicans“ or Democrats,
would be against such an amendment to the Constitution of the United .
States; and, if that is the case, any further discussion would be pretty
much a Waste of time. My25 colleagues will be interested to know that

156 [353

I had a conference with the Senator from Minnesota, and he told me
be was in favor of legislation of this type and that be has discussed”
the matter with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Commit-
tee, the Senator from Texas. '

Mr. Speaker, while I have the ﬂoor, I shall take just a moment
longer for the purpose” of discussing another matter that one of my
constituents brings up—the compensation of Civil Service employees
and other employees of the National Government. He insists” that
Congress carry out its pre-election -pledges to increase Federal salaries.
He observes that the Congress of the United States has made large
amounts of money available for29 other purposes but thus far it has
done nothing to help the Civil Service employees raise their living
standards in any way. He mentions the two pending bills as exam-
ples. He pictures the3° Civil Service employees as stepchildren and
observes that adjustment of their compensation should have taken
place years ago. V

Sometimes it is diﬂicult for Members of Congress to determine
just what the people of the United States Want. One constituent will
implore us to practice economy and stop making unnecessary expendi—
tures; another will insist that we make” additional appropriations for

31

~ the purpose of increasing production standards, or living standards, or

other kinds of standards. Under the circumstances, every Member of
Con gress33 must follow the course that he deems wisest. (1,162 stand-

THOMAS E. DEWEY l

(Extracts from his Lincoln Day speech in Washington, D. C.,
February 8, 1945.)

It is increasingly clear to everyone that neither justice nor freedom
can long continue to exist in a world beset by periodic total wars. Mod-
ern warfare strikes down the youth1 of the world. It also strikes at
the heart of freedom itself. By its very nature it forces even freedom—
loving countries to regiment their people in order to ﬁght total war.

/ Moreover,2 the terrifying developments of science have made war no
longer a matter between next-door neighbors. We have learned to our
sorrow that aggression anywhere in the world endangers all3 the rest
of the world. We now know that, in the future, aggression will be
possible by air from bases thousands of miles away. If there is an
aggressor anywhere in the world, all of us are4 his imperiled neighbors.

It is obvious that we cannot and must not risk another great war.’

It is equally obvious that, aside from adequate military forces and bases
for5 our defense in the future, our only hope of avoiding war lies in
effective international co—operation for peace.

War is an evil thathas scourged mankind from the beginning of‘;
time. It is not likely suddenly to disappear from the earth of its own
accord. As I have said so often, peace must be waged with all the vigor
and skill with which we wage war, or we shall always7 be having to
wage war. g T

We have nailed to our masthead one principle to which I believe
we must everlastingly adhere, or principles will count no more in.the
face of force. That is that we, as8 a nation, can, we will, and we must
take a full, responsible part in the establishment of collective security
among nations.

The opinion of our people has crystallized. They want9 the United
States to accept its responsibilities for the vital decisions affecting the
future of the world. Those who speak for our country need no longer
hide behind ﬁne phrases and” glittering generalities. There need no
longer be any doubt anywhere that the American people are prepared
to exercise their great power actively, continuously, and effectively“ in
the interest of a just and a lasting peace. . . .

158 W   [35’s

As a nation, we have strong views concerning the freedom of the
peoples of Europe. We want to know that those views are represented
in12 the decisions concerning the future of the people who have suf-
fered so much through conquest and reconquest and ﬁnal liberation.
We want to know that it is liberation in truth——that we13 have, in fact,
crushed out war-breeding totalitarianism wherever it infected those
nations. We want to know that we have not fought this war in vain.

As, in the name of Lincoln, we take” stock of our purposes in the
world, we must also inquire whether we are upholding his ideals at
home. _

Our nation was founded upon theclassic, liberal principle that gov-
ernment” is the servant of its people and not their master. Hand in

hand with this political idea of human freedom went the belief that B

men may be free politically only so long as” they are free economi-
cally. These were the contagious, compelling, exciting truths out of
which our country was established and became great.

These were not our ideas alone. They were in response" to the
clarion call to human freedom that swept over the western world in
the eighteenth century. During that century the French Revolution
and the American Revolution” were fought to establish the right of
people to rule themselves and the right of the individual to be free.
By evolution the same principles were then also being established in
Great” Britain and elsewhere. (669 standard words) (Concluded in

THOMAS E. DEWEY (Concluded)

Today these principles are under challenge. They are no longer
self—evident to a large portion of the world. It is said that individual
freedom can no longer exist in a modern1 industrial society; that gov-
ernment must be supreme, and the people must be its dependent
servants.

The wheel has had a full‘ turn between the eighteenth and twen-
tieth centuries. The2 intrusive idea today is again that all wisdom is in
government, and that it should exercise all power. Even as we ﬁght a
total war against that idea, it infects the?‘ minds of people every-
where. . . .

Here is the real battle of the years to’ come. Must the people of
America deny their own heritage and surrender to an absolute state?
Must we, too,“ when peace comes, join the march backward 200 years
to individual subservience to the master state?

Let us on this occasion proclaim our faith in a better way. It is the
way of progress5 not only toward ez/er—ii2crea5ing security but also
toward ever greater freedom of the individual. At times it may be the
slower, harder road. But it is the only road“ for Americans to take.

It is perfectly obvious to the rest of the world, and it ought to be to
us, that America has staggeringly outproduced every other nation in7
the world. Our 130,000,000 people have produced many of the winning
instruments of war for Great Britain, Russia, and China, as well as for
ourselves. It is obvious to the rest8 of the world, and it ought to be to
us, that this is because of the enormous initiative and inventive genius
that springs from the very heart of our system. Ours is a system which
rewards9 achievement, in which men can create and build with the
full knowledge that they and their families will beneﬁt, as well as
society as a whole. Ours has been a system whereby labor ism free to
work, to organize, and to share to the limit of its productive capacity
in the good things of life that are produced by all.

The very heart of that system is the classic libera concept that
every man is his own master and that government exists to keep him
free. It is in the natural development of that system that we assert
that neither accumulations” of great wealth nor monopoly—that

160 , [35’s

neither government nor any individual—shall control the lives of other
Americans. It is that system which guarantees and must make effec-
tive” equal rights for all, regardless of race, creed, or national origin.

These are the principles for which Lincoln lived and died. (479

CORDELL HULL

(On the occasion of his receiving the Woodrow Wilson Foundation
Peace Award on April 5, 1937.)

I was deeply moved when I was informed that the Directors of the
Woodrow Wilson Foundation had decided to confer upon me the
Foundation’s medal and to cite my efforts to bring about1 a lowering
of international economic barriers as the reason for this award. I accept
the honor with heartfelt gratitude. It evokes in me many memories of2
the long years during which the problem of improvement in the eco-
nomic relations among the nations has been of absorbing interest to me.

Among these memories, none is more vivid?’ than that of the eighth
day of Ianuary, 1918, on which the ideal of economic peace among the
nations received the formal championship of one of the greatest‘ states-
men our country has ever produced. It was on that day that Woodrow
Wilson laid before the world his historic peace program, Point Three
of which called for “the removal, so far as possible, of5 all economic
barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among
all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for
its“ maintenance.” ’

on the blackboard, they should be quickly reviewed several times dur-
ing the period through rapid reading in concert.

High-Speed Takes. The primary purpose of the high-speed take
is to develop the student’s shorthand speed and endurance.

High-Speed Takes Nos. 1-35 are in shorthand, and the key is given
in this handbook. The material should first be assigned for homework
practice and then used for practiced—matter dictation. The following
procedure is one that you may suggest to your students for their home-
work practice:

1. Read the entire high-speed take, to be sure that you know the mean-
ing of every outline.

2. Make one copy of the take in your best shorthand, dictating the
material to yourself aloud.

3. Practice the words or phrases that you did not write smoothly and
quickly.

The following period, after the student has practiced the high-speed
take at home, the material should be used for practiced—matter dicta-
tion. (See Chapter III, “Dictation.”)

High—Speed Takes Nos. 36-79 are in type, and each take is preceded
by a shorthand preview that is divided into two groups: a contains the
shortcuts that appear in the take; b contains the more diﬂicult words
and phrases, Written according to regular principles, words and phrases
that might cause some hesitation on the part of the student when
writing the take from dictation. The shortcuts in group a are listed
in the order in which they appear in the take. For convenience in
location, they are given in italics in the take. In group b, the words
and phrases are also listed in the order in which they appear; but they
are not given in italics in the take, as the student should have only
occasional necessity to lookup the meaning because of the review
nature of the _words and phrases.

This preview should be assigned for home practice. The following
practice procedure for the student is suggested:

1. Read through group at, referring to the take for any outlines that you
cannot read immediately.
2. Write one copy of the shortcuts in the preview.

I well recall the gratiﬁcation and joy that this clear—sighted appeal
to constructive statesmanship aroused in those of us who, like myself,
had watched the developments of the War years with a heart7 growing
ever heavier and more despondent.

President Wilson’s call was addressed alike to our friends and to our
foes in the stupendous conflict in which nearly the whole civilized
world was engaged8 at that time. On both side: of the battle front,
plans had been perfected for an indeﬁnite continuation of warfare in
the sphere of economic relations after the cessation‘) of armed hostili-
ties. The political and military alliances, the lines of which had been
drawn so sharply for the all-embracing purposes of the war, were to
be perpetuated” in the form of economic alliances. The world was to
continue to be divided into hostile camps. It was against this “war after
the war” that President Wilson raised his powerful“ voice. .

We have witnessed the spectacle of some nations, already in the
throes of economic poverty, straining their meager resources for the
creation of unprecedented armaments.” We have seen other nations
drawn into the suicidal race. The construction of armaments on so
vast a scale gives the impression of intensive economic activity. But”
that activity is like the unhealthy flush of fever. It destroys rather than
builds. It sows the seeds of disaster, either in the form of a military
explosion or of an economic” collapse.

There is only one way to avert this impending doom. It is for the
nations which today bend their major effort toward preparation for
war to join with those other nations which are” intent upon a, policy of
peace, in a determined and concerted effort to rebuild international politi-
cal and economic relationships upon a basis of16 friendliness and co-oper~
ation. No outcome of an armed conflict can possibly bring the nations
concerned greater beneﬁts than they can derive from a peaceful and
fruitful exchange of goods and“? services‘, developing in a liberal spirit
upon a basis of fair dealing and mutual regard for each other’s needs
and rights.

It was this type of economic peace that Woodrow Wilson” urged

‘upon the world. The acceptance by the nations of the basic -ideas

which underlie it is even more desperately needed today when the dark
clouds of a possible new war”) or of another economic catastrophe
gather .on the horizon. ‘

162 [35’s

As this is an intimate occasion, permit me to end these brief re-
marks on a personal note. I have never2° faltered, and I never will
falter, in my belief that enduring peace and the welfare of the nations
are indissolubly connected with friendliness, fairness, equality, and the
maximum” practicable degree of freedom in international economic
relations. I have never doubted the ability of statesmanship to create
conditions in which relations” of this type will become ﬁrmly estab-
Zis/zca’. I earnestly hope that no development will arise which will
impel me to relinquish this belief. . . . (796 standard Words)

“M1DnLETowN”—AND THE WAY OUT

The picture presented of a typical American community, based
upon careful research, is little short of devastating. Here is a town
(with an anonymous name) of1 38,000 people, carefully selected be-
cause of typical features which it shares with nearly a hundred and
fifty other communities in the United States of more or less the same2
size. Its population is largely native-born of native parentage. It has
participated generously in all the material comforts which in the last
forty years have come to be3 a distinguishing mark ‘of our American
civilization.

Its homes are equipped with electric lights, radios, bathrooms, tele-
phones, electric irons and toasters, and other laborsaving“ devices. Two
out of every three families own an automobile. Nine motion picture
theaters operate continuously seven days a week from 1 to 11 p. m.5

35°s_] 163

Finally, there is a Chamber of Commerce and a Country Club and a
Rotary Club and a belief that Middletown is “the best place on earth.”

But here is a population, too, when men read less than6 they did
forty years ago; where one hears little or no discussion of books; where
an appreciation of music or poetry or the other arts is almost non-
existent among the men.7

-Here is a town in which money is pre-eminently the measure of

value; in which worth is measured by ability to hold one’s own or get
ahead in the competitive, pecuniarys race in" which men and women
rush at so feverish a pace that there is no time left to think of the
purpose and meaning of life. Here is a town that at bottom is domi-
nated by fear—a9 fear of offending against the group, a nervous anx-
iety to run with the crowd, the keying—down of spiritual force to the
general level. . . .

Middletown is a town where everyonell’ conforms; one does not
vary from the standard. One joins the Country Club, if one can afford
it, and thus permanently ﬁxes his social status in the upper register.
One joins every” conceivable kind of organization or committee de-
voted to the improvement of this or that and spends frantic hours rush-
ing from one engagement to another. A successful lawyer” is likely
to belong to the Bar Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the
Rotary Club, one of the two or three leading churches, a high order of
the Masons, and the Country Club, while” his wife joins the more
fashionable women’s clubs, the group directing the local charities, and,
of course, the Country Club. . . . (476 standard words) (Concluded

“M1DDL1:rowN”——AND THE WAY OUT (Concluded)

In trying to understand the reasons for the dullness of the town, the
first obvious fact that stares us in the face isthat a common pattern
runs through the lives of all the people. There is little1 place for
variety. There was talk when one well—to-do family moved a little way
out of the city and built its house back from the road, partially hidden
by a grove of trees. There are few individual2 hobbies in Middletown.

Men and women dance, play cards, and motor as the crowd does.
A decreasing number is interested in gardening, a few turn to books,
one or two Write?’ a little. But being “different” is diﬂicult business in
Middletown.

And there is another reason for the dullness of the town which is
obvious to anyone who studies the community/4 life. Everybody is

busy. Idleness is a vice. To be continually busy, to ﬁll one’s days with!

exacting engagements, to rush from one organized activity to another5
-—in brief, to keep going-—-this is the supreme virtue in Middle-
town. . . .

Granted that it is dull because it lives a standardized life and be-
cause it exhausts itself in keeping busy with“ superﬁcial things, what
can we do about it? . . . I should like to suggest that the only life
worth living at any time in any age is the adventurous life. Now, by
the adventurous life I7 mean primarily a life that has a capacity to be
different. I mean a life that is willing to cut loose from the past for the
sake of the future, that will take chances in casting off from8 old tra-
ditions and old techniques. I mean by the adventurous life a life
unwilling to remain "tied up in any port, preferring to ride the high
seas in search of fairer lands—a life that finds9 serenity in growth.

Of such a life the dominant characteristic is that it is unafraid. It
has banished the word “fear” from its vocabulary. In the ﬁrst place,
it is unafraid” of what other people think. Like Columbus, it dares
not only to assert a belief but to live it in the face of contrary opinion.

35’s] 165

It builds its house back from the road, hidden by a grove“ of trees.
It does not adapt either its pace or its objectives to the pace and objec—
tives of its neighbors. It does not fear solitude, either physical or intel-
lectual. It thinks its own” thoughts, it reads its own books, it develops
its own hobbies, it establishes its own standards, it is governed by its
own conscience. It mortgages the integrity of its mind to no political”
party, to no ecclesiastical organization, to no groups whatsoever. Its
mind is its own. The herd may graze where it pleases or stampede
when it pleases, but he who lives the” adventurous life will remain

unafraid when he ﬁnds himself alone.—Raymond B. Fosdiek (502

Too SooN TO QUIT

Young persons sometimes ask Henry Ford, “How can I make my
life a success? ”—as if anyone could answer that question half as well
as the one who asks it. But occasionally Mr. Ford does give1 a valuable
tip, even if at the moment the young person receiving it fails to appre-
ciate it. One such tip would be, “If you start a thing, finish it.” It
sounds rather familiar, a2 piece of old—fashioned advice—but it is part
of an engineer’s design for living—-ﬁnish it!

“Yes,” one says, “but the thing may not be worth ﬁnishing.” Of
course, when he says, “Finish it,” Mr. Ford isn’t3 thinking about the
thing at all; he is thinking about you. In the preparatory time of life
the real job is not what you are workingion, but what it is doing to

166 [353

you. You start it with4 a great gush of z'nterest—you miss your meals
for it—then suddenly it goes stale—and you quit. Or you ﬁnd that your
plan is wrong—and you quit. And all that you have as proﬁt from
your effort is the knowledge5 of how to quit! “Well,” you say, “the
thing wasn’t worth it!” Quite probably; but you are, and that’s the
Whole point.

Plausible reasons for quitting arealways at hand. Mr. Ford said
one day that, when he was“ making his ﬁrst car in that little brick
house on the alley in the rear of his home, he worked with all the

ardor of young enthusiasm looking forward to great results. Then the

thrill and the interest7 simply evaporated. Why? He said he had gone
far enough on that ﬁrst car to see how he could build a second and a
better one, and the glowing new vision got in the way of his8 work.
What was the use of ﬁnishing the car he had started? Some untaught
inner wisdom must have warned him, for he forced himself on. He
soon discovered he was learning more and more about his second” car
by going on to complete his ﬁrst. But so strong was the temptation to
quit that he realizes now it was precisely that—a temptation to quit,
not merely an urge to do better——and1° had he yielded, he might have
failed to ﬁnish the second car, too. So, here is one‘ plausible reason for
dropping a thing unﬁnished—the chance to start something better.
Another handy reason“ for quitting is just the opposite—we want
to quit, not because we think we see something better, but because we
see nothing at all; so, why continue? Why not 1.‘/zrow up the sponge?

Well, that depends. Was” this thing laid on you to do? Were your j

motives sound? Had you a clear right and a clear reason to start it?
Very well——what has happened?  cloud has settled down and you

cannot see? Well, many a man has13 never seen the light he needed,

or the work he needed, until he entered that cloud and walked through
it. Following faithfully on never leads anyone into permanent dark-
ness. But for the quitter,” all he is likely to get is a stronger habit of
quitting and a lower place to begin again. The man who will not
give up, even if he fail of his objective, is led through to another”
objective; the man who hangs on as if he were paid to hang on can
always start again at par or better—-/ze has strengthened himself.
Most of us are where we are for a very good reason. This” is our
post, which has no one to hold it but us. If we abandon it, we dis-

35’s] 167

cover that it is something in ourselves we abandon. Iust keeping on,
through the most hopeless aspect of keeping on,” may be the impor-
tant act of one’s career. The last dejected effort often becomes the
winning stroke! After years of observation one is ready to say that
most of the people one has seen18 quit, have quit too soon. Another
Week, a few more good licks, standing by just a little longer—and the
whole situation would have opened into a larger phase. But, no! they

_ were more practiced in quitting” than in staying. . . . .

’ Quitting makes a dead end of any road——often just as it was ready
to open. Transfer if you must; catch another wave length; change
your level to a higher one, but don’t quit——2° it is always too soon to
quit.———W. I. Cameron (706 standard words)

‘GIVING WORRY‘ THE BRUSH—OFF

You may have noticed that as you grow older you are more inclined I

to worry. You look with envy on young children because they, as you
say, “have no worries.” What you mean to say is that you envy them1
because they have not learned to worry.

I know one man who has worked out his own formula for match-
ing worry ‘with intelligence. When he begins to Worry, here is what
he does. 4

He takes a pencil2 and paper and writes down the cause of his
worry. Then he writes down all the consequences that might ‘result

168 T ‘ [35’s

from the worst that could happen from the cause of his worry. On
another sheet of paper he?’ writes ‘down the chances of the thing’s not
occurring at all.

His next step is to put down a remedy for the situation. He knows
what he is ﬁghting against by this time; and if he is convinced4 that
his worry is just a silly quirk of his mind, he tear: up the papers and
laughs at himself for being foolish.

If you are worried over your physical condition, see a doctor; if
over5 your ﬁnancial affairs, see a banker; if over your mental states
that engulf you, see a psychologist. But do something to get rid of
those worries.

The next time a worry besets you, do“ not give way to it. Fight!
Fight by going out and doing something, with your hands, with your
feet, with your head—but do something!

Psychiatrists have come to recognize another cause for worry. It is
physical.7 We are under par physically, tired from lack of sleep, or

maybe have an’ upset digestion. See if your habits may be to blame. -

Perhaps the ﬁnal bit of advice which wise and competent8 psychia-
trists give those who worry is the best of all. . . . ‘

They urge them to cultivate the habit of laughter.

Without exception those who infest clinics and doctors’ oflices with
troubled minds9 are persons who cannot or will not laugh. They are
gloomy, never give voice to an honest, genuine laugh; and the disease
of worry has an easy time getting inside their lives. Those who can
laugh,” however, can shake oﬁ‘ the worst form of gloom, get over the
most worrisome days, and regain mental calm——merely by laughing.

Here are some suggestions to overcome worry and its effect:

1. If you“ have anything worrying you, have it out and be done
With it. ,

Bring your worries out into the open, face them, and decide what
to do about them. If you analyze first and worry after in” those cases
where you have something really to worry about, you will not make
the mistake of unreasonin g worry. .

2. Laugh a little more—not hysterically, but intelligently, like13 a
person who is philosopher enough to see that laughter is an important
side of life.

’ Seek out amusing things and laugh at them. Laugh much with

I

35’s] 169 -

others, never at others. Laugh much at yourself.” If you can laugh
at yourself, you’ll never take yourself seriously enough to Worry about
yourself.

3. Give your physical habits and practices a going-over to see if they
need15 improving.

Walk more; eat less; drink more water; go to bed earlier; get up
earlier. Iust pretend you are in training and live like an athlete.-

CAPITALIZING ONE’s LEISURE TIME

On the application blanks for employment of some of the largest
business houses today appears the question, “How do you spend your

leisure time?” The employer of labor knows that the way in whichl.

workers waste or utilize the interval between 5 or 6 p. m. and 8 or 9
a. m., and Sundays and holidays, may determine entirely their useful-
ness or uselessness in the long2 run, so far as their employment is con-
cerned. Dull heads and unsteady hands, no matter what the cause, are
no asset in any work whether it be mechanically routine or of the sort
that requires?’ judgment and adaptability.

How few of us ever take an inventory of our leisure time! What do
I do with the hours that are not spent in sleeping or working or
eating? What becomes4 of “the terrific wealth of forty—four hours”
between 1 p. m. Saturday and 9 a. m. Monday? What becomes of the

170 [35’s

hours between seven and eleven at night? Do they drop back into the‘?
silent, irrevocable past—unaccountably lost forever—without having
added one thing toward improving the mind or the body?

The wastefulness of the hours and hours spent in fruitless6 conver-
sation, in idle gossip, in the repetition of useless and derogatory stories
and incidents, outside of the misuse of time in overeating, foolish and
proﬁtless amusements,7 and the more loathsome miscellaneous vices-
the thought is, to say the least, appalling. t A

The problem is of such importance that present—day educators are
spending much thought and efforts on how to teach children to use
their leisure hours proﬁtably. The attempt is expressed by settlements
where young and old spend their evenings under proper guidance in
constructive games and amusements.9 Large business houses have day
and evening “welfare” work of various sorts, and free lecture courses
for adults are given in the public schools. The Boy Scout and Girl
Scout movement, too, is an attempt to1° solve the same problem.

However, these efforts cannot reach every adult worker. Therefore
the adult employee who has no welfare club or settlement or lecture
course to employ a part of“ his leisure hours successfully must work
out his own salvation.

Any method of employing leisure time in such a way that it in-
crease: a person’s knowledge, broadens his outlook, improves his”
eﬂiciency in any way, indirectly capitalizes it. We talk of capitalizing
experience, of capitalizing good habits, of capitalizing eﬂiciency” and
all that sort of thing; but little has been said of capitalizing leisure
time. We have motion study, occupation habit study—but what of the
study of utilizing the wealth of” leisure hours?

History abounds with illustrations of persons who have contributed
to the advance of civilization and the welfare of mankind. Too little
emphasis has been put upon” the fact that, in most of the lives of
these persons, the utilization of leisure hours in experimenting, in solv-
ing problems, in concentrated thought was a prominent feature of their
daily” lives. Lincoln and Edison are among the most commonly

known illustrations. (575 standard words) (Concluded in Par. 225)

3. Read through group b, referring to the take for any outlines that you
cannot read immediately.

4. Make one copy of group b.

5. Make one copy of the entire preview.

6. If necessary, rewrite any part of the preview that you cannot write

ﬂuently.

The better students need do nothing with the high-speed takes.
that appear in type. The teacher, however, may wish to have the
slower students make a shorthand copy of the takes as extra home
practice. This extra practice can be discontinued when the students
“catch up.”

The following period, after the students have practiced the preview,
the material should be used for previewed dictation practice. (See
Chapter III, “Dictation.”)

Building High Speed Through Reading. The primary pur-
pose of this _material is to develop vocabulary. Consequently, the
student will derive the greatest benefit from it through home practice.
The material should not be dictated to the students, except occasionally
for variety. The following procedure for handling this material is
suggested:

1. Before assigning each exercise for home practice, glance through it
quickly and pick out the words and phrases that might cause the students
diﬂiculty. Place these words and phrases on the blackboard as a preview.

2. Have the students read the entire exercise.

3. Have the students make one copy of the entire exercise.

4..In class, the following period, have individual students read
back portions of the exercise. Have each student read back a sentence or
two as a check that he really did the assigned work. Skip around in the
assignment, having students read back a paragraph from the first page of
the exercise; another paragraph or two on the second page, and so on.
In this Way, students will never know which portion of the take they may
have to read back and consequently will have to complete the entire assign-
ment in order to be prepared.

Because reading from printed shorthand plays such an important
part in the student’s skill—development program, many teachers ﬁnd
it desirable to supplement the shorthand textbook with the following:

1. The Gregg Writer, which contains each month more than ﬁve thou-

CAPITALIZING ONE’s LEISURE TIME (Concluded)

The methods all differ; it really makes little difference what the
method is as long as it is continuous, thorough, and definite. Watt,

as a boy, spent his leisure hours watching the‘ escaping steam lift the /

teakettle cover and thinking what utilization might be made of the
energy thus wasted. Sam Brown spent his leisure hours watching
spiders spinning webs, and his conclusions2 on their methods later led
to the building of the world’s ﬁrst suspension bridge. There was no
idle dreaming in his use of leisure time.

Richard Arkwright, whose name is among the greatest of those
Who helped?’ to bring about the eighteenth-century Industrial Revolu-
tion, supplies another illustration of the capitalization of leisure hours.
He was a barber early in life. His‘ leisure time was spent in crudely
experimenting in various ﬁelds, as he was of an inventive turn of
mind. He produced the spinning frame, by which it was possible, for
the ﬁrst time in history,5 to manufacture perfect warp threads with
great rapidity. Wealth and fame came to him; but in spite of that,
when Arkwright was over ﬁfty years of age, “feeling that the defects
of his education“ placed him under great diﬂiculty and inconvenience
in conducting his correspondence, and in the general management of
his business, he encroached upon his sleep, in order to7 gain an hour
each day to learn English grammar, and another hour to improve his
writing and orthography!”

172   S [35’s

The American office boy, the machine tender, the salesman on the
road who rises8 to the position of president of a corporation, each is
an illustration of a person who capitalized his leisure time. Of course,
you may say that this is not enough, that there must9 be native ability
and capacity. True, too, but remember that many a gifted person with
unlimited opportunities has gone down the ladder and not up.

A machine is so constructed“) that it does _certain routine operations
in a certain unchanging fashion until it breaks down. When it cannot
be repaired or is no longer needed for a particular job, it“ is ﬁt only
for the scrap heap. S ' T

A man, too, may be trained so as to do certain routine operations in
a particular way. The difference, however, between man and machine
is that the” man may adjust himself to changing conditions. To do
this, he must know more than one thing, and he must have the ability
to a certain extent to form judgments—in other words, he must have
“common” sense.”

i If a man cannot or does not change or improve his methods to ﬁt
changing conditions and is incapable of absorbing new experiences or
does not want to take the trouble” to do so, he is ﬁt only for the scrap
heap. He has the great, glorious golden wealth of leisure hours to
utilize proﬁtably; and if he will not, he must pay the inevitable pen-
alty.15 When a man of intelligent attainments like Hamilton Mabie
considered it necessary in maturity to study a new language every ﬁve
or six years—how very” necessary it is for those who have not attained
a position of note at least to make some effort at knowing their “jobs”
thoroughly in every bearing. This applies not only to the" employee
but to the executive as well.—Lee Galloway (604 standard words)

Hrs GREATNESS GRows

Samuel Langhorne Clemens was born to an impoverished family
on November 30, 1835. ‘ H

The infant developed into a boy with a frail body and a head1
which seemed always too large for the rest of him. For the sake of
posterity it would be nice to record that he was a studious youth, but
truth forbids it. His schooling at best was sketchy and insufﬁcient.2
With his friends, Will Briggs and Tom Blankenship (later to be
immortalized as Ioe Harper and Huck Finn), /26 was forever playing
hooky from school. The neighbors did not evidence surprise.3

“Like father, like son,” they said. The elder Clemens was a man
of considerable intellectual attainments-———a shiftless dreamer of great
dreams that never came true. Sam was eleven when his4 father died,
leaving the small family destitute. His school days‘ now deﬁnitely past,
the boy became a printer’s apprentice.

The transition from student to breadwinner changed young Sam
not one whit.5 He was an indifferent apprentice, spending more of his
time chasing about the streets than in learning the mysteries of type-
setting. Thus it was that he came to a turning point in his life, a6
turning point literally engineered by the winds of chance. Running,
boylike, after a swirling piece of paper, he discovered that it was a page
from some old history of Ioan of Arc. Something7 in her tragic story
kindled the ﬁres of ambition in his youthful heart. The books he had
hitherto despised became his greatest love, and with his reading there
came to him the desire to write. V

His8 work began to improve, and he was soon well on the way to
becoming a real printer. His elder brother had become owner of the
Hannibal (Missouri) Iournal, and Sam worked there for a time.9 Dis-
satisﬁed with his prospects, he started roving about the country, ﬁnding
jobs on various papers as he went. He was a youth of less than nine-
teen when he reached New York. Homesickness drove him“) back t
his beloved Mississippi Valley. ‘

174 S _ [353

Setting out again——this time to become a traveler in South America
—he booked passage on a river boat. A boyhood_urge to become a
pilot“ returned in full force, and for the next four years he scarcely
left the river. Here it was that he subconsciously became “Mark
Twain.” He heard the leadman cry it in the vast silence of the night
while the waters” of the mighty river slid beneath him. “Mark
twain” meant 2 fathoms (12 feet). It meant “safe water,“ and Sam
loved it.

Later, he joined the staff of Virginia City’s Territorial Enterprise.
‘The pay13 was $25 monthly-—just enough to hold off starvation. But
the job was an open door to fame, wealth, renown. It was also the
open door to some of his bitterest disappointments” and sorrows.

His sketch of “The Iumping Frog” launched his meteoric career.
He wrote proliﬁcally. Yet all too frequently his huge earnings were
devoted to paying off debts resulting from his” unfortunate business
ventures. ‘

ures of his pen will endure forever. The richness of his bequest to

231. High-Speed Take No. 55——Review

‘Mr. Chairman, it seems to me it is time that the Senate of t/ze
United States should take some deﬁnite action on the pending bill.
We have been debating the pending bill for some time, and in1 my
judgment we should begin by voting on some of the amendments at
once. I regret to say that some of the facts broug/zt up in the debate
seem to have increased the confusion in the minds of some Senatorsz
over the provisions of the legislation.

At the present moment we have on the ﬂoor of the Senate the bill
passed by the House of Representatives. We have the amendment
oﬁered3 by the committee; and we have the resolution offered by the

35’s] T   175

Senator from Nevada after his conferences with the Secretary of War,
the Secretary of the Navy,4 and the Secretary of Labor.

Up to the present moment, neither the chairman of the committee
nor any other membe-r of the committee has taken the floor to point

out and explain5 the differences between these three measures. So far, A

the debate has done nothing but increase the confusion; and, as a re-
sult, we have no practical suggestions to offer to the conference6.com-
mittee. I must warn you, my friends and colleagues, that your con-
stituents are observing your actions with much interest; and, under the
circumstances, you will be wise to produce _a bill that will7 be accept-
able to industry and agriculture.

Need I remind you that election time is near and that the American
people in general, and the constituents of your community8 in particu-
lar, will want to know the reason why Members of the Senate delayed
so long in acting on this emergency measure.

The gentleman from New Hampshire suggested that I9 undertake
to bring about a limitation of debate. Under ordinary circumstances I
would be against such action, as I have demonstrated from time to
time in the past. But, unless” we take appropriate action to carry out
our responsibilities in connection with this legislation, no other course
will be available tome.

I notice that the Senator“ from Ohio has an amendment that pro-
vides for the inclusion of Federal Civil Service employees in this bill.
He was in the Senate Chamber a moment ago but apparently” had
to leave for some reason. Let us take up that amendment now. The
Senator’s amendment, as I said, would bring Civil Service employees
under the provisions of this bill. In my jud gment,13 this is no time.to
establish a precedent of this type; and I hope that Democrats and
Republicans alike will vote it down. Keep in mind that the inclusion
of employees of the Federal” Government would put an added expense
on the Treasury of the United States at a time when the people of the
United States are calling for economy. This amendment would neces-
sitate” the establishment of another Federal bureau, with an adminis-
trator appointed by the President of the United States. The compensa—
tionof this administrator” would be at least ten thousand dollars a
year. It seems to me that it is time to stop these unnecessary expendi-
tures by the National Government.

176 - [352

The Senator from Ohio says" that he has made a pretty complete
survey of the opinions of Federal Civil Service employees in several
government services in the District of Columbia. He found that” most
Civil Service employees were well informed about this legislation and
are interested in it. I do not deny that the amendment would increase
the purchasing power of the Civil” Service employees and perhaps
raise their standard of living. But let us look at the other side of the
picture. If we appropriate this amount of money to take, care of the
Civil Service2° employees, what reason are we going to give for not
permitting increases to employees in industry? Their wages have not
been increased since two years ago. The standard of living for“ those
people has been reduced. Because of the accumulation of emergency
taxes that he must pay to the Federal Government, the average tax-
payer ﬁnds it difﬁcult to carry” on his regular affairs. Until the Con-
gress of the United States is ready to relax regulations affecting all
wage earners, I think it should not consider any legislation” of this
type. In other words, it is our responsibility to treat the American peo-
ple fairly; otherwise, our legislation might not.be able to stand up
under the scrutiny“ of the Supreme Court of the United States.

I hope that Members of the‘Senate will not say that I am against
the employees of the Government of the United States, that I am not25
interested in their prosperity, that I think more of the amount of money
in the Treasury of the United States than I do of the general interests
of the Civil Service employees.” Mr. Chairman, nothing is farther
from the case. The fact is that from time to time in the past I have
offered resolutions in the House to increase the appropriations for the
Civil” Service Commission. On each of those occasions, however, there
were no regulations governing the wages and salaries of non-Govern-
ment employees.

I notice that the Senator from” Ohio has now returned, and I know
that he will ‘want the floor for the purpose of defending the provisions
involved in his amendment. He has been interested in this matter ever
since he was” a member of the Department of Commerce several years
ago. I know that Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle will
derive much useful information from his contribution to3° the debate
even though I cannot at this time agree with him. After the Senator’s
remarks, I hope the way will be cleared so that Members of the Senate

353] 177

may vote on the amendment and then proceed‘°’1 to the consideration of
the treaties sent to us by the President of the United States. (1,103

WHAT ABOUT EcoNoMY?

The most economical person I ever knew was an inveterate spender
—-investor would be a better word, perhaps. He never let his money
lie idle, but was forever ﬁndingl ways and means to make his money
earn a good income.

The man realized that economy is the careful and judicious use of
anything. So many people think of economy as refraining2 from spend:
ing. V

Realize, then, that to develop that quality of economy you must

learn to spend wisely, and you are on the high road to becoming truly

economical.

There?’ are more kinds of economy than economy of money. There’s
economy of time and energy; these two are most important, for, unless
you use your time and energy properly, you’ll4 have no money on
which to practice economy!

To economize on time means to use your time to the best advan-
tage. To do this you must economize on energy, and that, in turn,

- means5 working to a plan and a schedule.

Do this:
178 S [35’s

List all the jobs you have to do in order of importance and begin
with number one. By so doing, you will do the most important job the
first‘; thing in the morning when your energy is greatest. If anything
has to be left undone, it is naturally something of lesser importance.

Of course, you cannot always do this, for the7 convenience of others
must be considered; but if you plan your work ahead, you will be able
to atcomplish much more than if you go ahead from one job to an-
other in a happy—go—lucky8 fashion.

Now a word as to economy of money. If you’ve never had to earn
money, it’s hard to economize on it, for you must appreciate the value
of a thing to use it9 judiciously—economicaZly. *

I’ll suppose that you have worked hard for what you have and real-
ize how easy it is to spend money and how hard it is to get it. A

Laxity in money” matters can be overcomeonly by continually
criticizing your expenditures. V —

Learn economy in your personal aﬁfairs. A good plan by which to
cultivate personal economy” is to divide your income into several parts,
one of which must be a savings account.

Allow yourself so much for carfares, so much for lunch, so much
for amusements, and so on until” all your salary is accounted for.
Then keep each item of expenditure within its prescribed limit.

Suppose you do not spend your full allowance on lunches, let us
say—save the unspent fund.” If you spend it on something else, you

have not saved it.‘ It is a good idea to put these small savings into an

“emergency” account in the bank to be used only in sickness or as a”
last extremity. p

Systematize your spending, for it is careless spending of a dollar or
two here and a dollar or two there that makes all the difference be-
tween getting ahead or getting“ into debt.

Nothing stiffens a man’s moral backbone so much as the knowledge
that lie has a few hundred dollars in the bank. He feels, and is, inde-
pendent. He works better and more happily on” that account. He
realizes that money works twenty-four hours of the day, while he
works only eight or ten hours.—Har0ld Whitehead (580 standard

JOURNEY INTO DESTINY

The year was 1804. The date, May 14.

Poised on the banks of the Missouri ‘River, near St. Louis, were
Captain Lewis and Lieutenant Clark, leaders of twenty—nine intrepid
men, prepared1 to set forth on a hazardous and toilsome journey. "Not
a man in the camp had reason to believe that he would ever be heard
from again after their three boats were launched on the broad breast
of the2 river. '

The epic venture had its beginnings in the vision and wisdom of
alert, imaginative Thomas Jefferson, third President of the United
State: of America. The greatest3 achievement of his administration
had but recently been conclu_ded—-the purchase by his envoys of the
million square miles of territory hitherto claimed by France, all of it
WestWard4 of the Mississippi River. The purchase price was $15,-
000,000, and Napoleon must have smiled when the deed was signed.
He thought he had driven a shrewd bargain.

Of even greater importance,5 countless numbers of ]eiferson’s .fel-

low citizens felt the same way. The_President was roundly abused for
a flagrant waste of public moneys. The tirade left him unmoved.
Boldly he went before6 the Congress with a demand for $2,500 to
ﬁnance exploration of the new domain- There was much debate, but
the money was appropriated. Whereupon »]efferson7 selected his own

180 [35’s

private‘ secretary, twenty—nine-year—old Captain Lewis, to lead the
“journey into destiny.”

The President charged Lewis to seek out and explore the unknown
empires with minute care, and added: “And search out even that
which lies beyond.” It was a man-sized order, but the young army
captain was equal to the task. He chose his best friend, Lieutenant
William Clark,9 as alternative commander.

When the small ﬂotilla poled out on to the Missouri, it was manned
by a hard—bitten, grizzled crew. Most of them were veterans of scores
of battles with the wilderness.” All the men had been carefully
selected. It made possible the amazing record of the loss of but two
men during the entire journey, one by death and one by desertion.

Few men have“ lived through more or greater perils in so short
a time. There was constant danger from drowning, from sunstroke,
from reptiles and wild beasts.

As the group struck deeper and deeper into the heart of the vast
Wilderness,” the men grew silent. Lewis was worfied about this. He
feared that it might portend wholesale desertions, even mutiny. A
sergeant sickened suddenly and died in agony. Lewis proved the13
quality of his leadership then. He told the men to elect their own

choice as successor to the dead man’s rank. This democratic gesture.

won over the "men completely.

“We hoisted sail and set” out in high spirits for the western expe-
dition,” the leaders wrote in their journal on May 14. It is this journal
which gives to Lewis and Clark their most tenacious hold on immor-
tality.15 Few of the entries are in such cheerful vein. The main point
is that they kept it—faithfully, unsparing of themselves, dutifully, and
completely. Its wor_ds laid a foundation for the development” of the
splendid new land /more enduring than granite, stronger than steel.

do much to increase the student’s shorthand vocabulary.

CHAPTER III
DICTATION

The topic of dictation will be treated under three headings—prac—
ticed matter, previewed matter, and new matter.

Practiced Matter. The term “practiced matter” means material
that the student has practiced at home, reading and copying it from
printed shorthand before it is dictated in class. Practiced-matter dicta-
tion should constitute the work of the greater part of the class period
while the student is in the elementary stages of his high—speed short-
hand study. As he progresses, the amount of this type of dictation
should be decreased and the amount of previewed material, which will
be discussed later, increased.

When the student has reached 120 words a minute, practiced-
matter dictation should be given only occasionally to:

1. Encourage the students by showing them that they have the
capacity to write faster than their present writing rate. Because stu-
dents have practiced the material a number of times and are conse-
quently familiar with it, they are able to write it at a higher speed
than their new—rnatter writing rate. A student who can write new
matter at, say, 120 words a minute will probably be able to write
practiced matter at 140 or even 160 words a minute. When this prac-
ticed material is dictated, a minimum of reading back by the student
should be done.

2. Develop’ a high degree of automatization on the vocabulary of
the practiced matter. This is especially true of review takes such as
Nos. 11, 22, 33, etc.

Previewed Matter. The term “previewed matter” means mate-
rial that the student has not practiced at home. He is, however, given

ILLUSTRATION or SHORTCUTS DEVISED DURING D'ICTATION

Mr. President and fellow members of the Association, for the past
twelve months our institution has been assigned to the training of
storekeepers for the Navy. This was a completely new venture for all
of us——-lnone of us had had any experience either as storekeepers or
as instructors in the subject. As the storekeeping was being offered
for the first time, of course no suitable materials were available.

The2 director appointed a committee of six members of the staff
to- work out material for storekeepers and put it in mimeographed
form. In the first weeks the going was not easy. The instructors had
to teach six3 classes of storekeepers during the day and prepare their
lesson plans at night. When the mimeographed materials were avail-
able, our troubles were not completely over. No sooner did we get a
set of sheets into4 the students’ hands than regulations were changed
or more were added.

In general, the storekeeper’s duties consist of typing numerous

-forms, tables, and reports in the office of the Supply Department. Al-

though much of the5 time is devoted to speciﬁc jobs required of store-
keepers, some time is provided for the development of skill and accu»
racy in typing from straight copy.

After the girls receive their indoctrination and training6 as store-
keepers on our campus, they are assigned to naval stations all over the
United States. Every six weeks a group is graduated and a new group
comes in. There seems to be no sign of a letup in this7 program. When

the program was instituted, we were told that we would receive 100

storekeepers every six weeks. The number was increased to 200 a few
months after the program was under way, and at the present8 time. . . .

PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT

Perhaps the best way of acquiring a good personality is to learn in
an active fashion the social attitudes and skills for which well-liked‘
people are noted. In addition to improving our poor qualities, we1 can
acquire the ways that people with ﬁne personalities have of dealing
with their acquaintances.

We know, for example, that popular persons are, as a rule, friendly,.

sympathetic with their friends’ problems, enthusiastic2 about doing
things, and usually cheerful. These are qualities that stand for deﬁnite
things that one does and that can be learned step by step by the young
man or woman who means business.

Socially desirable ways that3 make one liked are, of course, those
that “turn out” the energy of the individual into channels of action
in behalf of people. Such actions are the opposite of the way of self-
concern and inaction. There are perfectly4 natural reasons u//zy we
prefer persons who remember our names, who send us cards on our
birthdays, who ask us how we are getting along, and who are willing
to help us whenever they can. We like such people because5 they have
generous social tendencies that make us feel that we are worth some-
thing, that we have real value in their eyes.

There is no secret about why some people are regarded as having

40’s] 133*

such good personalities.“ The “boss” who, while expecting honest work
from his oﬂice employees, shows a sincere regard for their needs and
problems is invariably well liked. His staff calls him a “good scout.”

In fact, it is a common observation that7 well—liked people are
those who show an interest in the problems of even their casual ac-
quaintances, such as newsboys, elevator men, oﬂice clerks, and the pro-
verbial milkman. It would surely pay unpopulars people to learn these
simple but important social skills whether they feel like it or not.

Psychologists have learned that unhappy individuals are the very
ones whose extreme self-concern has prevented them from develop-
ing9 the warm social outlook described. (367 standard words) (Con-

PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT ( C ontin aecl )

A noted psychologist in New York City has reported what appear
to be the qualities of personality possessed by a large number of high
school students who made excellent scores on his Personalityl Quotient
Test. The youths in question rated approximately as follows:

1. Those who used a reasonable amount of their energy duringithe
day in constructive sports and games, and who slept well at night as a
result, made2 higher personality scores than did those who were not
physically active.

184 ’ a [40’s

2. Students who took part in school activities—musical organiza-
tions, dramatic plays, and clubs of various kinds—were more socially3
effective than those who avoided these activities continually in favor
of such inactive hobbies as reading and listening to the radio.

3. Young people who belonged to social organizations4 earned
higher ratings on the personality test than did others. Students who
attended Sunday school and whose parents make a habit of going to

church also tended to make excellent scores. S

4. Youths who were sociable,5 who enjoyed mingling in groups,
who introduced people to one another, who paid well—worded compli-
ments on appropriate occasions, who were careful about hurting other
people’s feelings, and who avoided what is commonly6 called “frank
criticism” were almost always high on the various personality tests.

5. High school students who enjoyed mixed parties, who had
learned to dance, who found wholesome pleasure in social affairs, and

who were inclined7 to associate to a reasonable extent with members '

of the opposite sex made higher personality scores than those who
cared little for any of these things.

6. Those who were willing to work at various8 jobs in order to help
support themselves had much better personalities than did those who
refused to work when they did not feel like it. Willingness to help
the family ﬁnancially is a very important factor9 in personality.

7. Boys and girls who had deﬁnite moral standards, and who would
frequently do unenjoyable things because they were right or because
they were expected, were much higher in the personality” ratings than
were the unpopular youths who would do only what they pleased and
when .they pleased. The conscientious boys and girls also possessed
the ﬁnequalities of being friendly with people whom they disliked
and of staying by“ tasks even at the expense of their fun.

From this list of qualities and social skills we can see about What

’ the personality of a desirable high school or younger college student

is like. Such a person is (1)12 active physically, (2) sociable, (3)
friendly, (4) interested in community organizations, (5) attracted to
persons of both sexes, (6) willing to work, and (7) much inclined to
be both diplomatic” with people and respectful of moral and ethical
codes. (531 standard words) (Concluded in Par. 252)

PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT (Concluded)

These are excellent qualities and represent a pattern of personality
that all of us might well try to achieve; they are effective in the busi-
ness world if used with sincerity and discretion. Employersl every-
where are looking for applicants with such qualities.

The reader can easily see why a person who has the majority of the
seven aspects of personality just described is happy within himself2
and popular with people. But what is more important is the fact that
the qualities and skills involved are the kind that can be singled out
and learned like any other skills.

In short, any student who so desires can use the3 seven points (and
others similar to them) as a personal program of improvement‘. Step
by step and point by point he can practice the various skills involved.
This is why we are so sure that good personality can be4 developed.
Such development is a matter of doing certain desirable things that
can be understood and learned. There is no mystery about the matter.

The builder of personality may begin, for example,5 by paying an
occasional sincere compliment to someone who has done well. He
should then go on developing cheerfulness, good humor, and sociable
way: at school gatherings and with his teachers. In connection with“
these personality exercises, the student should always make it a point

186 E [40’s

to do what he can to contribute to whatever school work or program
is being carried on. Under no circumstances should one who is try-

' ing7 to improve his personality go to social or school affairs for the

purpose of seeing what he can get out of them in the way of proﬁt or
fun. Good personality is not won that way. Well-liked people ares
those who first consider the interest: of others and give to the welfare
of the group. This is really the heart of the problem of good person-
ality. ,

Psychologists have found that well-liked young people are those
who” are fair and generous to people whether they feel like it or not,
and who are willing to deny themselves frequently for the good of
their school or other institution.

Personality building will be a different” problem for every indi—
vidual. Some will proﬁt greatly by learning to play a musical instru-
ment (as many have) or by going in for some form of athletics. Both
these skills bring their possessors into“ interesting activities with other
people and thus offer ﬁne opportunities for personality development.
Other students may need to improve their dress, their manners, or
their attitude toward members of the” opposite sex. Still others may
well begin to earn part of their expenses, become more independent
in planning their careers, or learn to stay by their duties even when
these interfere with pleasures.

Business education” students might well begin practicing the
active social abilities that are regarded as essential to success in business
relations. These would include, in addition to some of the skills just
mentioned, regard for the” welfareof an employer’s business, willing-
ness to adapt one’s self to various working conditions, and diplomacy
in dealing with the people upon Whom the success of a business de-
pends.

Those who work steadily15 on, learning one skill after another until
they have overcome the original feeling of self-consciousness, soon ﬁnd
both their popularity and their happiness improving. The important
thing is to make a realm start and then to do something active and
constructive every day.—-Louis P. T/zorpe (653 standard words)

TEN TRAITS THAT MAKE A LEADER

Some time ago I decided to ﬁnd out just what qualities are inherent
in leadership. The best way I know for ﬁnding out what kind of man
it takes to do any job is tovstudy the men who are successfully1 doing
the job. So I decided to study a group of outstandingly successful
employers. « .

Of course,.you can’t take a successful leader and put him under a
microscope or dissect him to see what makes him tick. But you2 can
put him under the scrutiny of men who know him well and use their
ﬁndings to cut through to his essentials.

And so I asked thirty of the outstanding personnel experts of the
country, men who have hired a good portion3 of the key executives
of American industry, to analyze ten business and industrial leaders
who by common agreement are tops in ability. The experts were
asked to pull no punches; all names would be4 kept secret. They were
to rate the ten great leaders on a score sheet on which were listed all
the mental qualities, personality traits, and behavior habits I could
imagine being of any importance.

Was the leader5 cheerful, friendly, popular, courteous, modest,
thrifty, well groomed, even-tempered? I asked them to rate him on
each quality as outstanding, above average, below average, or seriously
deﬁcient.

The same for“ a long list of other qualities—forty characteristics in

all. 1 A c
188 [40’s

The results were unmistakable and surprisingly consistent. From
these ﬁndings it can be said deﬁnitely that there are ten basic traits of?
leadership that successful leaders have abundantly, and that mediocri-
ties have in slight degree or lack completely. ’

Surpassing all other qualities to be found in real leaders is good
judgment—the ability8 to make decisions upon the basis of facts
instead of emotion. The next most important trait is the ability to plan.
The third is justness, fairness in dealing with all men.

These are the essentials of leadership.9 Men who possess these
traits and little else will make leaders, though, of course, they should
have many other qualities. Men who lack these three abilities will
never make leaders, no matter what other prepossessing qualities they“)
may. display.

The next three traits in which successful leaders excel are, again in
order of importance, open-mindedness, initiative, and decisiveness.

The ﬁnal four are enthusiasm, courage, ingenuity,” and its close
cousin, resourcefulness. “Ingenuity” was deﬁned as the ability to ﬁnd
new methods for solving problems, and “resourcefulness” as the ability
to meet emergencies promptly. 7

Please do” not misunderstand—these ten traits are not all that a
man needs to ﬁt him to do any and every job. Obviously, there are
many jobs where punctuality and industriousness are supremely im-
portant. But” they are not supremely important in a boss, and so they
are not the traits that will push you to the top or keep you there.

Some of the qualities that are vices in the leader are virtues in the
ranks, and vice versa. An” employer was complaining to me about
one of his assistants. “He’s the most pigheaded man in the oﬂice,” he
ranted. “If he hadn’t been so loyal to me during the depression, I’d
ﬁre hirn tomorrow.”

I told him” simply, “He couldn’t be loyal without being stubborn;
stubbornness is the basis of loyalty.” Similarly, an enthusiastic man is
seldom a modest man. You can’t have everything. (636 standard

TEN TRAITS THAT MAKE A LEADER (Concluded)

A manufacturer said to me the other day, “I’d make Bill Smith
foreman if I could depend on him to get out the work. The men trust
and respect him, but he himself isn’t such a good workman. He doesn’t
produce half as1 much as some of the other men.”

I made a check and found that, just as I suspected (having run into
such cases before), Smith spent a good portion of his day helping
other men. ,They came to him with their problems, and he2 solved
them. His own production rate suffered as a result.

“Appoint him,” I said. “He’s already the leader of the groups unoﬂi—
cially.”

Leaders rarely stand on dignity. One of the most successful indus-
trialists I3 know walked into his shipping department at the height of
the busy season and asked a-civil question of a shipping clerk.

The clerk wheeled suddenly and gave the president of the company
a stinging slap on the face; then stood there4 pale and frightened wait-
ing for the words of dismissal.

There were a few seconds during which the chief executive had his
little conﬂict between emotion and judgment. Then he quietly walked
to the foreman’s oﬂice and made5 inquiries. He found the clerk had
been working sixteen hours a day for more than two weeks, and
ordered an immediate two—week vacation for the clerk with full pay.

Turning the other check is not recommended unreservedly,6 but
this particular executive is the idol of his workers. They recognize
the fact that he has judgment. A

190 [40’s

Judgment, the ability to make decisions based on facts, not emo— _‘

tions, is a rarer quality7 than we realize. Even the most choleric execu-
tive will assure you that his decisions, made during violent ‘fits of
anger, are wholly factual and not emotional. By contrast, I know the
head of8 a great utility company who has taught himself never to
make a decision while he is high or low emotionally.

Iustness ﬁgures largely in leadership, and I recently ran into a vivid
illustration.9 Two companies in the same city got some urgent war
orders requiring immediate attention and plenty of overtime.

In the first company, the master minds got together and decided
the thing could” be done by cutting the lunch period to 15 minutes.
A brief order to this effect. went out, without explanation.

The president of the other company got all his men together—on
company time-—read the”- War Department letter, and said:

“We can only do the job if you men are willing to cut your lunch
hours and work Saturday afternoons and Sundays for the next month.
The things they want are urgently needed in the Pacific——12some of
you have sons there. What do you say?”

In the ﬁrst plant, labor turnover increased by leaps and bounds; in
the second production leaped.

It is only just, as real leaders know, that the little people in any
organization” understand why drastic changes in policy are made.
These are the things that should be considered in selecting leaders,
for leadership can be hidden behind graceless fagades. But many of
these leaders will never“ be uncovered if we adhere to the baseless
doctrine that a well-shined shoe, a polite smile, and an ability to get to
the office on time are excellent reasons for pr0motion.—C/zarle: C.

an opportunity to practice a shorthand preview of the more diﬂicult
words and phrases in the material before he takes it from dictation.
By far the greatest bulk of the students’ class dictation should be on

T previewed matter after they have passed the elementary stages of high-

speed development. The “preview” method of dictation is the most
effective and most economical teaching procedure yet devised for the
development of shorthand speed.

1. Because the preview eliminates mental hesitation on the part of
the student, he can write more ﬂuently and with greater conﬁdence.
The elimination of mental hesitation prevents discouragement, an
important factor in the failure of many students to attain higher speeds.

2. The use of the preview saves time, as it concentrates on the
words and phrases that are new or that might cause difficulty during
dictation.

3. The preview method is a steppingstone to our ultimate objective
—the writing of new matter. I

New Matter. The term “new matter” means material that the
student has not practiced and for which no preview of any kind is
given. New matter should be used only for testing purposes, to test
the student’s growth as a result of his training on practiced and pre-
viewed material. New matter should be used only when the student’s
growth has been suﬂicient to test.

Suggested Dictation Procedures. There are, of course, various
successful methods of developing high speed in shorthand. While
these methods differ in procedure, they have features in common:

1. They utilize the shorthand preview, to eliminate mental obsta-
cles for the student. »

2. They constantly press the student to write beyond his present
writing speed. « I

3. They place the greatest burden of speed building on many short
spurts rather than on long takes.

Two of these successful methods are given here in considerable
detail. It is recommended that the teacher try them both and determine
which he prefers. The teacher can be assured that both plans have
been tested under classroom conditions and will produce gratifying
results when the plans are followed as outlined.

As a small boy, Lee was taught the ideals, the patriotism, and the
courage of the Father of his Country. Many long2 winter evenings the
boy listened to famous stories of his country’s history, told to him by
his father; and the boy grew up in an atmosphere full of historic
achievements.

» In his later years, Robert"E. Lee became?’ one of the most famous
general: the world has ever known. With the teachings of his father
uppermost in his mind, with the noblest blood of southern aristocracy
ﬂowing through his veins, and with the tune of “Dixie” ringing‘ in his
ears, Robert E. Lee led men to defend a noble cause. His courage, his
simplicity, and his military genius made him loved and admired, not
only by the men of his army, but by generations to come.5

For nearly siXty—ﬁve years, Lee yielded his life to helping others. His
heart knew many heartbreaks, and he knew life’s greatest lesson:
“Life is made worth living by sacrifice.” Silent and deeply religious,
and a marvelous master6 of military strategy, he became one of the
greatest heroes of the Civil War (if not the greatest). When he sur-
rendered to Grant, he turned to his soldiers after his conference with
the northern general, and said:7 “We have fought through the war
together. I have done the best I could for you. My heart is too full to
say more.” Great tears rolled down his cheeks—-not because he had
lost. No! Lee was too much of a man to portray his feelings to his
already8 disheartened soldiers. It was the great heart of Lee. He was
seeing his soldiers—the men who had become endeared to his heart
during the years of struggle——tired and hungry, returning to a deso-

— OUR COURTS

Courts are established by the Government» to perform the judicial
functions of interpreting the law and determining the rights of society
and of individuals.

The enforcement of the law is the duty1 of the executive depart-
ments of government. The President is the head of the United States
marshals, who carry out the orders and decrees of the Federal courts.
The enforcement of the laws of each state is carried2 out by the gov-
ernor through the county sheriffs.

Municipalities do not make laws; they enact ordinances. The mayor
is the chief administrator of his municipality, and the police have the
same relation?’ to him as the United States marshals have to the Presi-
dent and the sheriffs have to the governor of a state.

There are two distinct systems of courts: the Federal Court system
and the state system. They are essentially4 the same in plan and opera-
tion, differing slightly in some respects only.

The type of cases allowed to be heard by a court depends upon the

402] s » 193

jurisdiction that the court has had conferred on it by the5 Constitution
and by the statutes of the respective states. '

All courts fall into one or the other of two classiﬁcations: those
having original jurisdiction and those having appellate jurisdiction.
Originale jurisdiction is the power to hear the first presentation of the
case; appellate jurisdiction is the power to review cases previously heard
in a lower court. Some courts have both original and appellate7 juris-
diction. , V

The principal Federal courts are: the United States District Courts,
the United States Circuit Courts of Appeal, and the Supreme Court of
the United States. ’

The United States District Courts are the lowest8 courts in the
Federal system; they have jurisdiction over civil, equity, and criminal
cases.

Each state in the Union has a Federal District Court, and densely
populated states have more than one. ‘There are9 ninety districts in
the states and territories of our nation.

There are ten Circuit Courts of Appeal throughout the United
States, each one usually supervised by one Supreme Court justice; in
some cases, however, one“) justice is assigned to two circuits. The
District of Columbia is a separate circuit administered by the justice
of the Fourth Judicial Court. By recent Congressional action, Puerto
Rico has been added“ to the First Iudicial Circuit, and Alaska and
Hawaii have been added to the Ninth.

Each Supreme Court justice has administrative control over his
particular circuit but has nothing to do with deciding” cases, which
are heard by a group of three to six circuit justices. Witnesses do not
appear before the Circuit Court of Appeals, as the case is conﬁned to
the record; but attorneys appear and give oral argument.”

The Circuit Court of Appeals reviews the case, as previously tried
in the Federal District Court, by studying the record and the transcript
of the hearing in the lower court. It decides whether the decision is
correct” or not and hands down its written decision, either upholding
or reversing that of the lower court.

The Supreme Court of the United States, like the highest courts of
the various states, has appellate jurisdiction“ over all cases originating
in lower courts. Some appeals go direct from the District Court to the

194 [40’s

Supreme Court of the United States, while other appeals to the Su-
preme Court can be taken only from the Circuit C ourtm of Appeals.
The. Constitution of the United States, in Article 3, Section 2, Clause
2, reads:
“In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and
Consuls, and those in which a State shall be a Party," the supreme

Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all other Cases before men- ‘

tioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Iurisdiction, both as to
Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations”
as the Congress shall make.”

Congress is constantly making changes in the laws governing juris-
diction of Federal Courts.

The Supreme Court of the United States has jurisdiction over all
Federal questions and” over the interpretations of the Constitution of
the United States.

The Supreme Court of the United States is the most powerful
judiciary body in the World; it has the power to declare the acts” of
the legislature unconstitutional. (809 standard words) (Concluded in

U OUR COURTS (Concluded)

The principal state courts are: justice—of—the—peace, civil, and district
courts; county courts, or probate courts; circuit courts, appellate courts;

40’s] 195

and Supreme Court. State judges are elected at stated periods by popu-
lar vote. ’

 The courts1 of the lowest jurisdiction in the state judicial system are
the justice-of-the-peace, the civil, and the district courts. These courts
have jurisdiction over civil and criminal cases. In civil cases, the jus-
tices’2 courts are limited to hearing cases involving small sums of
money, the maximum amount varying in different states. The limita-
tion of justices’ courts in criminal cases is to the hearing of3 misde-
meanor cases.

The trial before a justice of the peace is not ﬁnal; it can be appealed
to a higher court, where an entirely new trial is conducted.

The justice—of-the-peace court is not a court of record; that is,4 no
shorthand notes are required to be taken of the testimony, except in
certain instances. When no regular reporter takes notes, the justice
writes the substance of the testimony in longhand.

The county court, or5 probate court, has jurisdiction over the pro-
bate of wills and the administration of estates and related matters. This
court determines the validity of wills, both as to manner and form of
execution and“ as to the testator’s capacity. Its jurisdiction may also
include administration of trusts under wills and guardianship of in-
fants and incompetents. Each county has at least one of these courts.

-The general’ trial courts in the state judicial system are the circuit
courts. Each county has a circuit court. One judge, however, may
serve several counties; or one large county may have many branches of
its circuit court. This court, having8 what is termed “general jurisdic-
tion,” is empowered to try civil, equity, and criminal cases. Some states
call these courts district courts, superior courts, or courts of common
pleas. ‘
In heavily populated counties,9 special courts have been created by
the legislature to take over the criminal work that otherwise would be-
long to the justices’ courts and the circuit courts. One of these specially
created courts, frequently called“) the municipal court, hears criminal
cases involving felonies, which are ordinarily heard by the circuit
court. The other, sometimes known as the district court, hears cases

involving misdemeanors that otherwise“ would be heard by the jus- .

tice court. The court that hears felony cases has appellate jurisdiction
over the court hearing misdemeanor cases.

196 a [403

The decisions of the lower courts, such as the circuit and the county
courts,” are not ﬁnal; cases may be appealed to a higher court. In the
larger states special appellate courts have been created to prevent the
overcrowding of the state supreme court with appeals. The decisions
of such intermediate” appellate courts are ﬁnal, unless the state su-
preme court decides to hear the cases appealed.

The state court of last resort is usually known as the Supreme
Court, but sometimes by other names, such as the Court of” Appeals
and the Court of Errors and Appeals. The designation “supreme”
does not indicate that the court has jurisdiction over the other state
courts; for example, in New York the highest court is the Court of
Appeals, and” below it is a court known as the Supreme Court. The
constitutions and statutes of the various states must be consulted for
the exact status of the various courts.

The jurisdiction of the highest court is generally” limited to review—
ing cases from the lower courts and to superintending the work of
those lower courts. On reviewing the case, the higher court reads the
record of the lower court and decides whether any mistakes” were
made in the trial of the case. If error is found, the case is remanded to
the lower court for retrial, or the decision of the lower court may be
reversed or modiﬁed by the appellate court.-—Adaptea' from The Legal

275. High-Speed Take No. 66—Review
(This take reviews all the shortcuts.)
Mr. Chairman, the legislation before the House of Representatives

today appropriates more than $400 million for four departments of the
Government of the United States—-the Department of1 Agriculture,’

403] p 197

the Department of State, the Civil Service Commission, and the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation. The legislation provides a deﬁnite amount
of money for these departments to carry on for2 another year. Alo
though these expenditures are only a part of the appropriations ap-
proved by the committee, you will observe that they total more than
$260 million. I want to "point out, however,3 that these departments

‘have taken on new responsibilities‘ from time to time since the last

appropriation a year ago. Part of the increase in responsibilities is due
to circumstances beyond the control4 of the Congress of the United’
States and the American people. I

As Members of the House well know, the Appropriations Com-
mittee is one of the most powerful committees of the House of Repre-
sentatives.5 This committee regulates the amount of money that shall
be made available for any given bureau or agency. Members of the
House know that, when the Appropriations Committee presents legis-
lation such6 as the pending bill to the floor of the House, the bill takes
into'consideration the interests of the Treasury as well as those of the
taxpayers. Mr. Chairman, I am conﬁdent that Members of the House
will7 agree that under all the circumstances our committee has done a
pretty good job. If you stop to consider the pressure and the limitations
under which the various subcommittees must work in obtaining accu-
rate“ information, you may wonder how the committee continues to
meet the high standards it set up many years ago.

Mr. Chairman, I should like to point out some practical changes
that in my judgment should be made9 at the earliest possible moment.
I bring up these mattersas a «result of several conferences I had soon
after the election with my colleagues, both Democrats and Republi-
cans. The Committee on1° Appropriations established the policy some
years ago of carrying on its deliberations behind closed doors. In other

words, Members of Congress are not invited to take part in the debate. -

The only way“ by which the average Member of Congress can learn
about the provisions of these bills is to wait until they are brought up
in the House for consideration. He has no other way to obtain infor-
mation. Consequently,12 he has no opportunity to prepare amend-
ments.

In my judgment, there is no reason why these meetings, which have
a direct bearing on the purchasing power and the prosperity of every

198 _ [40’s

community” and every constituent, should be closed to all Members
of Congress except those on the Appropriations Committee. Another
fact we must bear in mind is that most testimony with respect to ex-
penditures comes” from the administrators of the Government serv—
ices. These administrators may be interested in economy, but I have
yet to hear one explain that his department would welcome a reduction
in its” appropriation. Of course, the administrator, whose responsi-
bility it is to run a department, should know the amount of money
required to take care of its expenses and the compensation and wages
of its” Civil Service employees in the District of Columbia and else-
where. Nevertheless, I think the establishment of an independent
bureau set up for the purpose of gathering facts for the Appropriations”
Committee would bea wise step, a step that should have been taken
years ago. The information that this bureau would accumulate would,
it seems to me, increase the general eﬂiciency of the Appropriations
Committee.” I shall offer a resolution on the floor to create such a
bureau. There is no similar problem facing Senators in the Senate of
the United States, as, of course, that body is not concerned with appro—
priations” any more than the House of Representatives is concerned
with the making of treaties.

Furthermore, it seems to me that the Appropriations Committee
and the Ways and Means Committee, another powerful2° committee
of the National Government, should work more closely in the produc—
tion of appropriation bills. That committee must provide the money
for the expenditures that the Appropriations Committee“ authorizes.
At the present moment, no provision is made for conferences between

these two committees. My friend, the gentleman from New York, who

is the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, explained that
he has tried” many times to convince Members on both sides of the
House that these conferences were necessary; but he was not successful
in getting any action. These two committees should meet from time to
time so that each will have a23 complete picture of the involved and
diﬂicult work of the other.

Mr. Chairman, during the few moments that are still available to
me, I should like to discuss generally some of the items of the pending
bill.“ You will notice that one item provides for the appropriation of
$450,000 for the improvements on Federal Court buildings in the

4095] 199

United States, including the Supreme Court of the United25 States.
Our committee was informed that that amount of money would be
ample to carry out all improvements planned a year ago. In any case,
we can make an emergency appropriation if more funds are needed”
for any reason.

Another item calls for an expenditure by the Department of State
of $600,000 for entertainment in foreign countries. This represents an
increase of $100,000” over a year ago. Personally, I thought that a
reduction rather than an increase should be made in that appropriation;
but the majority decided that the Secretary of State should have the
amount of28 money he asked for. They reasoned that he has always
exercised economy in the past and that he would carry on in the same
way in the future. Perhaps, in view of the new responsibilities that the
Secretary” of State and his colleagues must soon talqe on when the
peace treaties are considered, this additional appropriation is justified.
When I told the committee I was against this appropriation, I was

thinking of“ the interests of the taxpayer. (1,206 standard words)

THANK GOD, I’M AN AMERICAN!

All of us should turn our thoughts occasionally to that adven-
turous group of our ancestors who set aside a day each year for
Thanksgiving. Anyone who has stood on the wind—swept coast at
Plymouth, where the hard black granite1 of New England yields as
slowly to the hoe and the plow as it does to the restless beating of a
tireless sea, can well wonder what the Pilgrims had to be thankful for,
On the one side, it was only an arrow’s ﬂight to a2 wilderness ﬁlled
with savages. On the other, it was three months’ sailing to the com-
forts of civilization. There was hunger to the point of starvation. Yet
the humble survivors knelt and fervently thanked God. For what?
NQt3 for well-ﬁlled cupboards, but for the courage to face temporary
adversity, for conﬁdence in the future, for faith in ultimate achieve-
ment of the ideal that led them to the New World.

We have many real4 advantages for which to be thankful. I thank
God I was not born into a caste system that places one human being

either above or below any of his fellows. I inherited no aristocratic .

rank of duke or5 lord that entitles me to special privilege of any sort;
nor was I doomed to serfdom or peasantry by the accident of birth.
It was one of the first concepts of American government “that all men
are created6 equal.”

I thank God for the American schools that made available to me a
share in the intellectual and cultural heritage of mankind. Education
l1as checked and will eventually defeat tyranny7 Wherever it manifests
itself in this land. Free schools are the only guarantee of a free people;
they are the only means whereby every individual may prepare him-
self for Whatever service hes is capable.

I thank God for American freedom to earn a living in a job I myself
selected.‘ No social traditions dictated that I should follow the occupa-
tion of my father. No agency of9 the state told me Where or at what
I must labor. The option was wholly my own, and I was given abun-
dant opportunity to prepare for the profession of my choice. V

I thank God for American rights—for the right” to think; to
speak; to write and to print what I think; for the right of peaceable

Plan A—The Pyramid Plan} The pyramid plan is a plan for
breaking down a “take” into parts of varying lengths and dictating
each part at a certain speed. The objective of the plan is to increase
the student’s speed 20 words a minute on the take.

In order to describe the plan in detail, let us assume that the class
has reached a speed of 100 words a minute for 5 minutes on new
matter, and that we wish to increase that speed to 120 words a minute
on matter that has been liberally previewed.

We know that a student can write for at least a half minute at a
speed 20 words a minute faster than he can for 5 minutes; also, that
he can write for 2 minutes at a speed of at least 10 words a minute
faster than he can for 5 minutes. The students in this class, therefore,
already can write for a half minute at 120 words since they can write
for 5 minutes at 100 words.

Our ﬁrst goal is to raise the students’ speed to 140 words a minute
for a half minute, then to 130 words for 2 minutes, and ﬁnally to 120
words for 5 minutes. ‘

Here are the steps in the pyramid plan applied to a class already
writing 100 words a minute: ‘

Step I. Selectfrom the students‘ text the high—speed take for the day
or a take from 200 Take: (see schedule on page 17).

Step 2. Prior to the dictationperiod, assign for study a preview con-
sisting of the more dilﬁcult words and phrases in the take. This preview
should consist of about 60 words and phrases (10 per cent of the take).

Step 3. (This is the first step in class following the study assignment.
The step should be preceded always by a 2-minute warmup on easy brief-

‘form matter. The purpose of this warmup is to get every student in readi-

ness to write.) Place the entire preview on the blackboard in large out-
lines. Have the students read them once rapidly and write them once from
dictation at the rate of one outline a second. Leave this prez/iew on the
board throughout the period so that any student who desires to check his
outlines against the correct ones may do so without wasting the time of
other students. (2 minutes)"

Step 4. Dictate 500 words of the take at 100 words a minute. The pur-
pose of this initial dictation is to give each student the satisfaction of

assembly to discuss with my fellows the way out of diﬂiculties which
harass me as an individual or beset us collectively“ as a people; for
the right to protest and to petition those in authority for the removal
of grievances and of obstacles to the happiness and welfare of my
neighbors and my family; for the right to” subscribe to any creed in
which I believe and to worship as seems to me most ﬁtting. I am
grateful for the right to uncover truth and to proclaim it. I am glad
to have these rights guaranteed to me in the most sacred” instrument
of our government—the fundamental law of the land——so they cannot
be taken from me by pretext or annulled at the will of some dictator.
And so, I thank God I’m an American. All may not be right
with“ America. There is still.with us some of the social injustice and
pestilence to the removal of which we dedicated ourselves as a young
nation. But the fundamental human rights that are the essence of”
Americanism are still held sacred by our people and by our responsible
leaders. ‘We have much more than the Pilgrim fathers expected to
secure for their posterity in the New World. Every one of us can say”
with even more meaning and fervor than the Pilgrims said, “Thank

WOODROW WILSON

(Extracts from his address at Columbus, Ohio, September 4, 1919,
supporting the League of Nations.)

Mr. Chairman, Governor Campbell, my fellow citizens, it is with
very profound pleasure that I ﬁnd myself face to face with you. I have
for a long time chafed at the conﬁnement of Washington. I have for
a ‘long time1 wished to fulﬁll the purpose with which my heart was
full when I returned to our beloved country; namely, to go out and
report to my fellow countrymen concerning those affairs of the world
which now need to be settled. The only people I owe any report2 to
are you and the other citizens of the United States.

And it has become increasingly necessary, apparently, that I should
report to you. After all the various angles at which you have had the3
treaty Izela’ up, perhaps you would like to know what is in the treaty.
I ﬁnd it very difﬁcult in reading some of the speeches that I have read
to form any conception of that great document. It is a document‘
unique in the history of the world for many reasons, and I think I
cannot do you a better service, or the peace of the world a better serv-
ice, than by pointing out to you just what this treaty contains and what
it5‘ seeks to do.

In the ﬁrst place, my fellow countrymen, it seeks to punish one of
the greatest wrongs ever done in history, the wrong which Germany
sought to do to the world and to civilization; and there ought to be
no“ weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment.
She attempted an intolerable thing, and she must be made to pay for
the attempt. I can testify that the men associated with me at the7 Peace
Conference in Paris had it in their hearts to do justice and not wrong.
But they knew, perhaps, with a more vivid sense of what had happened
than we could possibly know on this side of the water, the many sol-
emn covenantss which Germany had disregarded, the long preparation
she had made to overwhelm her neighbors, and the utter disregard
which she had shown for human rights, for the rights of women, of
children, of those who were helpless?

They had seen their lands devastated by an enemy that devoted

40's] V ‘ V 203

himself not only to the effort at victory, but to the effort at terror-
seeking to terrify the people whom he fought. And I wish to testify”
that they exercised restraint in the terms of this treaty. They did not
wish to overwhelm any great nation. They acknowledged that Ger-
many was a great nation, and they had no purpose of overwhelming
the German” people; but they did think that it ought to be burned
into the consciousness of men forever that no people ought to permit
its government to do what the German Government did.

This treaty was not intended merely to end this war. It was in-
tended to prevent any similar war. I wonder if some of the opponents
of the League of Nations have forgotten the promises we made our
people before we went to that peace table. We” had taken by proc-
esses of law the ﬂower of our youth from every household, and we told
those mothers and fathers and sisters and wives and sweethearts that
we were taking those men to ﬁght a war which would end business

of that13 sort; and if we do not end it, if we do not do the best that

human concert of action can do to end it, we are of all men the most

unfaithful. . . . (647 standard words) (Continued in Par. 287)

thought Great Britain1 was going into it, and that she most certainly
would never have gone into this war if she dreamed America was
going into it. And they all admitted that a notice beforehand that
the greatest powers of the2 world would combine to prevent this sort
of thing would prevent it absolutely. When gentlemen tell you, there-
fore, that the League of Nations is intended for some other purpose
than this, merely reply this to them: If we do not3 do this thing, we
have neglected the central covenant that we made to our people, and
there will then be no statesmen of any country who can thereafter
promise their people alleviation from the perils of war, The passions‘
of this world are not dead. The rivalries of this world have not cooled.
They have been rendered hotter than ever. The harness that is to unite
nations is more necessary now than it ever was before, and unless
there is5 this assurance of combined action before wrong is attempted,
wrong will be attempted just so soon as the most ambitious nations
can recover from the ﬁnancial stress of this war. . . .

The heart of this treaty then, my fellow6 citizens, is not even that
it punishes Germany. That is a temporary thing. It is that it rectiﬁes
the agelong wrongs which characterized the history of Europe. There
were some of us who wished that the scope7 ofthe treaty would reach
some other agelong wrongs. ‘It was a big job, and I do not say that we
wished that it were bigger, but there were other wrongs elsewhere than
in Europe and of the same kind which no doubt ought to be righted,
ands some day will be righted, but which we could not draw into the
treaty because we could deal only with the countries whom the war
had engulfed and affected. But so far as the scope of our authority
went, we rectiﬁed the9 wrongs which have been the fertile source of
war in Europe. '

We of all peoplesin the world, my fellow citizens, ought to be able
to understand the questions of this treaty without anybody explaining
them to us, form we are made up out of all the peoples of the world.
I dare say that in this audience there are representatives of practically
all the people dealt with in this treaty. You do not have to have me
explain national“ aspirations to you. You have been brought up on
them. You have learned of them since you were children, and it is
those national aspirations which we sought to release and give an

WOODROW WILsoN (Concluded)

If I were to state what seems to me the central idea of this treaty,
it would be this: It is almost a discovery in international conventions
that nations do not consist of their governments but consist1 of their
people. That is a_ rudimentary idea. It seems to us in America to go
without saying, but, my fellow citizens, it was never the leading idea
in any other international2 congress that I ever heard of; that is to say,
any international congress made up of the representatives of the gov—
ernments. They were always thinking of national policy, of national
advantage,3 of the rivalries of trade, of the advantages of territorial
conquest. There is nothing of that in this treaty. You will notice that
even the territories which are taken away from Germany, like her
colonies,4 are not given to anybody. There is not a single act of annexa-
tion in this treaty. Territories inhabited by people not yet able to govern
themselves, either because of economical or5 other circumstances, are
put under the care of powers who are to act as trustees—trustees re-
sponsible in the forum of the World at the bar of the League of
Nations, and the terms upon which they are to exercise6 their trustee-

ship are outlined. They are not to use those people to ﬁght their wars’

206 t [40’s

for them. They are not to permit any form of slavery among them,

or of enforced labor. They are to see to it that there are humane condi-._

tions7 of labor with regard not only to the women and children but
to the men also. . . . V

I said at the opening of this informal address, my fellow citizens,
that I had come to make a report to you. I want8 to add to that a
little bit. I have not come to debate the treaty. It speaks for itself, if
you will let it. The arguments directed against it are directed against
it with a radical misunderstanding of9 the instrument itself. Therefore,
I am not going anywhere to debate the treaty. I am going to expound
it, and I am going to urge you in every vocal method you can use to
assert the spirit of“) the American people in support of it. Do not let
men pull it down. Do not let them misrepresent it. Do not let them
lead this Nation away from the high purposes with which this war was
inaugurated and fought.“ As I came through that line of youngsters
in khaki a few minutes ago, I felt that I could salute them because I
had done the job in the way I promised them I would do it; and when
this treaty is accepted, men will not” have to cross the seas again.
That is the reason I believe in it.

I say “when it is accepted,” for it will be accepted. I have never
entertained a moment’s doubt of that, and the only thing I have been
impatient” of has been the delay. It is not dangerous delay, except
for the temper of the peoples scattered throughout the world who are
waiting. Do you realize, my fellow citizens, that the whole world is
waiting on America?“ The only country in the world that is trusted
at this moment is the United States, and the peoples of the world are
waiting to see whether their trust is justified or not. That has been
the ground of my impatience. I15 knew their trust was justified, but I
begrudged the time that certain’ gentlemen wish to take in telling
them so. We shall tell them so in a voice as authentic as any voice in
history, and in the years to come men will be” glad to remember that
they had some part in the great struggle which brought this incom-
parable consummation of the hopes of mankind. (664 standard words)

CONFERENCE—FEBRUARY 14, 194—

Chairman: I called this meeting this morning to see if we couldn’t

year ago, but we haVen’t done a thing1 for him so far. Yesterday I
Visited his office, and I must say his request is justiﬁed.

Mr. Brown: Smith also talked to me about more space about a Week

was—whether more space was available in that building, but he said
there was not an inch to be had. The question now is whether we
Want to move right in the midst of the rush season.

Mr. Frank: Is Smith in favor of moving3 now?

Chairman: He doesn’t like the idea of moving rightnow, but he
is desperate for more space. He wants it so badly that—

Mr. Brown: But even if we decide to move, it will probably be
several weeks before we ﬁnd a suitable4 place and a few more weeks
after that before we actually get in.

Mr. King: I suppose the most sensible thing we can do is to make
the best of it in the present quarters until this rush season is over, but
authorize5 Smith to ﬁnd a suitable location and negotiate a lease so
that the office can be moved at the earliest moment possible.

Chairman: Perhaps the wisest thing is to havehim ﬁnd several
places and consult us6 before signing any lease. Do you remember the
trouble we had when we moved into this building?

Mr. King: Will I ever forget that headache. It took me about six
months to get things straightened out. (274 standard words. The

THE LESSON or THE “DEAD LINE”

I was calling upon one of the country’s great general: of industry.
He was a big, genial, friendly man, chief of a $50 million factory group
commanding an army of employees. He was famed for‘ his accom-
plishments. ’

“I began as a reporter on a daily newspaper,” he said. “What I
learned in those days has helped me through all my life.”

“What was it you learned?” I asked.

“Dead lines,” he replied. “I learned early in those days to respect
the dead line. I learned that at a certain moment each day all my
work had to be done. At that unchangeable fraction of time the job
must be over. It could not be missed.

“At a certain minute the copy had to be in.3 At a certain minute
the type had to be set, the proof read, the forms locked up. At a cer-
tain minute the presses had to start. Trains never waited. The papers
had to go on.

“When I got into business life I found that few men4 knew the
meaning of the dead line. It was not a thing in their consciousness.
They did not finish. Tasks piled up. Correspondence and masses of
details were left over to the next day. Tomorrow was always a good
day, or the next.5

“It came to me that I possessed something that thesepother men did
not have.

“So all my life I have mapped each day’s course, worked to the dead
line, swept my desk clean. Every day, all my life, the dead line has
been the policeman that has guided“ my conduct.

“If any man should come to me and ask me for my most—prized
secret, this one thing I would say to him:

THE VITAL THREE FEET TO ACHIEVEMENT

For many years I have kept a magic rule on my desk. It has liter-
ally been worth more than its weight in gold to me. When I have an
impulse to quit, this rule keeps me at work. When I become discour-
aged, it whispers encouragement.‘ _

It all started back in the Colorado gold rush. An Easterner was
bitten by the gold bug. The man made the long trip to Colorado and
started to dig for his fortune.

And he did strike gold—an unusually” rich vein. His ﬁnd was so
large that pick—and—shovel digging was inadequate. He needed ma-
chinery.

He hurried back to the East, breathlessly told his friends of his
strike, of the great opportunity, and of the need for3 money to install
machinery. He took their money back to Colorado, and soon the
machines were loosening the richest ore yet discovered.

210 x r [40’s

Then one day the ore suddenly failed. The. new machines were
bringing out just plain4 dirt. So the mine was sold to a dealer in sec-
ondhand machinery, and the disillusioned prospectors returned to the
East.

The secondhand machinery man left the machines intact and called
in some experts who understood5 the peculiarities of the mountains.
They discovered that, centuries before, the crust of the earth had
slipped at the very spot where the disappointed easterners halted dig-
ging. Dig a little more, the experts said,“ and you will pick up the
vein of ore again. '

The new owner started the machinery and dug one foot, two feet,
three feet, and, lo! there was the rich ore again. If the original owners
had only stuck to it for three more7 feet! .

The original owner was made bankrupt by the mine, but it also
made him rich. It made him rich by the lesson it taught-—to stick to
it, not to quit at the ﬁrst discouragement. Those three vital feet that
he neglected8 to dig in Colorado haunted him. ,'

Back East, he became a salesman. Those three vital feet had made
him a star salesman. When he was given “No” for an answer, he
would come back to the prospect later and dig another foot,9 then an-
other, and usually he made a sale.-—Domzld A. Laird (370 standard

Step‘ 5. Have the first half of the dictation read back by one or two
students. Assist the readers as much as necessary. (2 minutes)

Step 6. Dictate four 1/2-minute takes at exactly 140 words a minute,
stopping a few seconds between each dictation. Instruct the students to
ﬁnish each take, even though they must write after you‘ stop dictating.
Have only one of the takes read back, preferably the third half minute.

Step 7. Redictate the four 1/2-minute takes at 130 words a minute with-
out stopping. (21/2 minutes)

Step 8. Have the last half of this take read back. (1 minute)

Step 9. Repeat the procedure in Step 6, giving four more 1/2-minute
takes. Have the last half—minute take read back. At this stage it may be
necessary to “borrow” from the next high-speed take or repeat from the
beginning in order to be able to complete the 5 minutes. (3 minutes)

Step 10. Redictate these four E/2-minute takes at 130 words a minute
without stopping and have the first half read back. (2/2 minutes)

Step 1]. Have the students rest a minute or two and then redictate the
entire 600 words at 120 words .a minute——the goal for which you are striv-
ing. (7 minutes)

Step 12. Have the students read approximately 300 Words of the last
take, starting in the middle of their notes. (2 minutes)

Total time for the 12 steps———30 minutes.

Step 12 completes the pyramid plan. The plan may be used for any
speed and will result in an increase of 20 words a minute in nearly
every case. Please keep in mind that this plan is a teaching plan and
not a testing plan. It must not be used for every take. As the stu-
dents approach the point at which their 20—word increase in speed is
almost assured, less repetition of the same take is necessary and the
time spent on each take should be cut in half.

As soon as the student has reached the new speed level, which is
20 words above his former speed level on familiar matter, the pyramid
plan must be set aside and a suflicient number of takes of previewed
matter dictated to establish the student more ﬁrmly on this new
level. These takes should be dictated not more than twice, and the
only advanced preparation permitted should be the practicing of a

T shorthand preview.

HARRY S. TRUMAN
(Extracts from his V-E Day Speech, May 8, 1945. The shorthand

notes were written by Jack Romagna, the President’s press—conference
reporter.) E

This is a solemn but a glorious hour. I only wish that Franklin D.
Roosevelt had lived to witness this day. General Eisenhower informs
me that the forces of Germany have ‘surrendered to the United Na-
tions} The ﬂags of freedom ﬂy all over Europe.

For this victory we join in offering our thanks to the Providence
which has guided and sustained us through the dark days of adver-
sity. .

Our rejoicing is sobered and subdued2 by a supreme consciousness
of the terrible price we have paid to rid the world of Hitler and his
evil band. Let us not forget, my fellow Americans, the sorrow and the

heartache which today abide in the homes of so3 many of our neigh-‘

bors—neighbors whose most priceless possession has been rendered as
a sacrifice to redeem our liberty.

We can repay the debt which we owe to our ‘God, to our dead, and \

to our children only by work—by4 ceaseless devotion to the responsi-
bilities which lie ahead of us. If I could give you a single watchword
for the coming months that word is—work, work, and more work.
We Amust Work to ﬁnish the war. Our victory is but5 half won.
The West is free, but the East is still in bondageto the treacherous
tyranny of the Japanese. When the last Japanese division has sur—
rendered unconditionally, then only will our ﬁghting job be done.
We6 must work to bind up the wounds of a suffering world-to
build an abiding peace—a peace rooted in justice and in law. We can

build such a peace only by a hard, toilsome, painstaking work—by ‘

understanding and working with7 our allies in peace as we have in
war.

THE TAXES WE PAY

It is clear that government performs many necessary serz/ice:—does
work that is indispensable to our welfare and that can be done better
or cheaper by the community than by private enterprise. That’s why1
we have government.

It should be equally clear that this work has to be paid for, like
any other work We hire people to do.

We pay for it in taxes.

When pioneer families built blockhouses to protect themselves
aguinst2 Indians and when they constructed roads and bridges, they
knew they had to pay for them. For the most part, they did the work
themselves, so that their payment for community services. was in the
form of direct labor. When they?’ hired others to build and maintain
their roads and supervise their community governments, they paid
taxes.

, In the United States there are more than 175,000 governments or
divisions of government.‘‘ No matter where one lives, or how, he must
make payments in the form of taxes to some of these governments.

Who pays taxes? The answer is: Everybody.

Here are the main kinds of taxes:

The general property tax furnishes5 the main support for local gov-
ernments, and is used to some extent also by many state governments.
It is levied principally on real estate——land and improvements.

40’s] s 213

In some states there are taxes on personal“ property also——household
goods, jewelry, art collections, and_the like.

The general property tax became long ago the normal means of
supporting both state and local governments. Tangible property, prop-
erty7 in sight, was then considered a fair measure of both ability to
pay taxes and beneﬁts received from public services. Now a great
many people live on salaries and wages rather than on income from
land,8 and neither wealth nor income depends solely on the ownership
of real estate. This tax, therefore, is no longer so reliable or suitable
a basis for the support of either state or local government, and9 is being
supplemented more and more by taxes of other kinds. Some state gov-
ernments now levy no general property tax for state purposes.

Where local government services, especially for education“) and
highways, have expanded beyond what can be supported by the gen-
eral property tax, state and Federal aid is often furnished. It is de-
rived from taxes, which of course must be paid by the people of the
commanitiesfl but the state and Federal governments collect their
revenue by forms of taxation other than those that local governments
use.

The National Government and many state governments levy taxes
on the incomes” of individuals and corporations.

The personal income tax is levied on all but the smallest incomes.

The corporation income tax, used by both Federal and state gov-
ernments, has been prodacin g more” revenue even than the personal
income tax. Corporations must pay special taxes also on proﬁts above
a certain level and on the amount of their capital stock, besides the
property taxes, previously“ mentioned, in states and localities.

There are taxes on the manufacture, sale, or consumption of cer-
tain goods. These are called “excise” taxes. Those that bring in the
most revenue are on tobacco, liquors,-and gasoline. But“ many other
excise taxes are paid—as, for example, on motor vehicles, tires and
tubes, entertainment tickets, and telephone and telegraph messages.
Many states and some cities levy sales taxes on nearly” all kinds of
retail sales.

Some of the excise taxes are on retail purchases. The seller col-
lects the tax for the government. (664 standard words) (Concluded in

THE TAXES WE PAY (Concluded)

Other excise taxes may be paid by manufacturers—some by re-
tailers—but in most cases they are included in the prices paid by the
customers who use the goods or services. We call these “hidden” taxes.
Besides‘ the tax on the ﬁnished product——or even if there is none-—
manufacturers may have had to pay hidden taxes on parts or mate-
rials, so that many taxes may have entered into the total cost. Nobody2
can ﬁnd out just what he pays in taxes of this sort—which are involved
somehow in the prices of most of the goods he buys. .

For many years the main source of revenue for the United States
Treasury was customs duties; that3 is, taxes levied on goods imported
from foreign countries. The consumers of the goods, of course, must
eventually pay the duties—sometimes in the prices of the goods im-
ported, sometimes in the prices of other goods that‘ the imported
goods are used for making. It may be in the price of a garment that
contains imported yarn, or a machine that contains an imported metal
or alloy, or a candy that contains imported sugar.

This5 type of tax, or tariff, is levied not only for the revenue but
also for protection of our industries and agriculture against foreign
competition. b If the Federal Government did not provide this protec-
tion,“ many products of our own people would be crowded out of our
own markets by goods produced in countries where the standard of
living is low and the costs of production are kept down by low wages.

Estate or inheritance’ taxes are imposed by the National Govern-
ment and by all states on the property of persons who have died.

It is an estate tax if it is levied on the estate before it is divided
among the heirs.8 It is an inheritance tax if it is levied separately on
the portion of each heir.

These taxes are graduated so as to reach a high percentage of the
value of large estates. There are also taxes on9 gifts to reach prop-
erty distributed before death occurs. ’

Social Security taxes are paid both by employed persons and by em-
ployers for the beneﬁt of their workers.

There are also various business, license,” and privilege taxes. One
oil company,‘ for example, pays as many as 200 different taxes. And a
company publishing magazines states in an annual report that during
the year it ﬁled 44,000“ tax returns‘with Federal, state, and local gov-
ernments.—From Taxes and What They Buy (452 standard words)

SHORTHAND REPORTING AS A PROFESSION

(The shorthand notes were Written by Miss Anna Pollmann, ﬁrst

. Woman ever to be appointed as oﬂicial reporter to the Supreme Court

of the State of New York.)

The court reporter’s record is to the courts what accountancy and
bookkeeping are to business. The. reporter’s Work is full of interest.

216 a [40’s

No two cases are alike. There are different problems and personali-
ties involved} different motives of action, different situations and
details. Many of the cases reported in court outrival the most brilliant
novels or plays in action, in humor, and in dramatic climaxes. Everyz
phase of human life comes within the purview of the shorthand re-
porter. The verbal combats of lawyers with witnesses and with one
another; the rulings and charges of judges; the science and art of pre-
senting3 cases; the logic of law; the spell of oratory, of pathos, of
humor, are all for the reporter to witness and feel and put down on
paper.

Charles Dickens found reporting to be the great school of human
nature, from4 which he drew the characters that made him immortal.

S The reporter who adds general reporting to his courtroom activities

enjoys even a wider range of interests.

318. High-Speed Take No. 77—Review

(This take reviews all the shortcuts.)

Mr. President, if my friend, the Senator from New York, will per- T

mit me, I should like to comment on one of the matters he brought
up on the ﬂoor a moment ago. The Senator pointed out that, as a
result of the1 war, the states are at the present moment in a better
position to carry out some of these practical projects than is the Federal
Government. The expenses of the Government of the United States
have increased2 rapidly since a year ago. In my judgment, if the Sena-
tor’s observation is not true now, it will be true pretty soon unless we
stop appropriating large amounts of money for bureaus that are carry-
ing on3 activities of debatable value.

40’s]   217

I am glad that the Senator made such a practical speech on econ-
omy. I am glad that he has given the constituents in his community,
as well as the people of‘ the United States, a clear picture of what is
happening with the large expenditures from the Federal Treasury. But
I must remind the Senator that Members of the Senate and Members
of the House of Representatives5 have a deﬁnite responsibility to pro—
vide work for every returning soldier, either under the Civil Service
or in private industry. The Senator seems to think that in general the

states6 are in a better position than is the National Government to take ’

care of this matter. Under ordinary circumstances, I agree that it
would be wise to leave this to the states. Keep in mind, however, that
we7 are now faced with an emergency; and it seems to me that the only

.way to meet this emergency is for the Federal Government to under-

take a plan that will beneﬁt every community alike.

I8 need not inform Members of the Senate that the future prosperity
of the American people depends on whether or not the Congress of the
United States passes legislation such as the pending bill.

Mr.9 President, every Senator is in sympathy with our colleague’:
efforts in the interests of the taxpayer. I might explain that, as chair-
man of the committee that brought up this legislation, I called special
meetings” from time to time during the past few months for the pur-
pose of reducing expenditures in all Government departments and
bureaus, including the Department of State, the Department of Agri—
culture, and the Department” of Commerce. '

In this case, however, both Democrats and Republicans on our com-
mittee were convinced that these appropriations were justified; and a
resolution recommending the passage of this legislation” has been in-

troduced on the ﬂoor of the Senate.

-A fact that we must bear in mind is that we must build up the
average wages and purchasing power of every employee, as well as
raise his standard of living.” When our committee framed this bill
before the last election, after many conferences with the Secretary of
the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of Labor,
it was convinced that” it was tal{in g a wise step. In other words, the
pending bill is the product of many minds. Administrators in the Dis-
trict of Columbia as well as Members of the Senate on both sides of
the Chamber contributed” their ideas.

218 S [40’s

The Senator from Minnesota, who is against the pending legisla-
tion, indicated that he was convinced that, unless some of the involved
regulatory amendments and provisions are removed” from the bill, he
has reason to believe that the Supreme Court of the ‘United States will
declare it unconstitutional. He served notice that he would vote against
the bill. However, we must not overlook the fact that” the Senator
from Montana, who rendered valuable service to the committee and
who sat on the bench of the Federal Court in his state several years
ago, takes a contrary view. Nothing in the pending billls places any
limitations on the states; but, as the gentleman from West Virginia
explained yesterday, most states are helpless to take any action. They
cannot borrow any amount of money except for speciﬁc” emergencies.
This fact was recently established by a decision of the Supreme Court
in a case involving my state.

By our action we are not undertaking to bind any future Congress
of the United States.2° We are only making available an amount of
money that the states can use for the purpose of improving roads in
their communities. If the next Congress decides that this legislation is

'unu/ise, it can reduce the“ appropriation or abolish the bureau that

Was established to supervise the expenditure of the funds.

Mr. President, no man either in the Senate or in the House has
raised his voice against the constantly” increasing expenditures of the
Federal Government and the great debt that the National Government
has accumulated. No man has preached economy in the Federal Gov-
ernment more forcefully than I. In23 fact, a year ago some of my col—
leagues in the Senate wondered whether I was more interested in the
taxpayers’ purse than in providing our armed forces with the supplies
they need. I had my reasons for keeping down“ expenditures from
the Federal Treasury at that time. But, Mr. President, at the present
moment, in my judgment, we should be more interested in creating
employment than‘ in economy—and that is the reason25 for the action
of our committee. I hope the Senate will agree to reduce the appro-
priation for this road program.

Before I leave the ﬂoor of the Senate, let me remind Members of
the Senate that two vital pieces” of legislation are waiting to be acted

‘_ upon—the treaty between the United States and Mexico involving an

appropriation fora proposed new highway to Mexico; and the adjust-

40’s] 219

ment of the27 compensation of Senate employees. I might explain that
both bills have been pending a long time and in my judgment should
be passed without amendment as soon as we dispose of the pending
bill. (1,114 standard words)

WOODROW WILSON

(Opening of Peace Conference in Paris, Ianuary 18, 1919. The short-
hand notes were written by Charles L. Swem, President Wilson’s per-
sonal secretary and reporter.)

Mr. Chairman, it gives me great pleasure to propose as permanent
chairman of the conference M. Clemenceau, the president of the coun-
cil. I would do this as a matter of custom. I would do it as a tribute1
to the French Republic. But I wish to do it as something more than
that. I wish to do it as a tribute to the man. France deserves the
precedence not only because we are meeting in her capital and because
she has2 undergone some of the most tragical sufferings of the war,
but also because her capital, her ancient and beautiful capital, has so
often been the center of conferences of this sort upon which the for-
tunes?’ of large parts of the world turned. It is a very delightful thought
that the history of the world, which has so often centered here, will
now be crowned by the achievements of this conference. More nations
are represented here than4 were ever represented in such a conference
before. The fortunes of all peoples are involved. A great war is ended

220 a [40’s

which seemed about to bring a universal cataclysm. The danger is
past. A victory has5 been won for mankind, and it is delightful that
we should be able to record these great results in this place.

But it is the more delightful to honor France because we can honor
her in the person of so distinguished a servant.6 (240 standard words)

EDWARD R. STETTINIUS, IR.

(Extracts from his address at the Pan—American Conference held in

Mexico City on February 22, 1945. The shorthand notes were written '

by Lee Blanchard, personal stenographer to Mr. Stettinius.)

I reviewed the achievements of the Crimea Conference with the

President of the United States when I met him again three days after

we had left the Crimea. It is the President’s ﬁrm conviction that the

results1 of the Crimea Conference have‘ greatly advanced the basic

objectives of United States foreign policy.

My purpose tonight is to speak to you of our hopes of what may
be accomplished here in Mexico City2 and of these basic objectives of
our foreign policy.

The earliest possible ﬁnal defeat of the aggressors who plunged the

e world into war and so gravely threatened the security of this hemi-

sphere is, I3 am sure, the ﬁrst objective of the other American repub-
lies, as it is of the United States.
Military matters are, of course, not in my field, but it was generally

When the student has consolidated his gains at his new writing
speed, as determined by a new—matter test (see Chapter V, “Testing”),
the pyramid plan may be resumed at the next goal, which in this case
would be 140 words a minute.

Plan B—The Minute-Step Plan.‘ Assuming that the class is
able to write a first reading of a 1-minute dictation at about 100 words
a minute and that we are reading one of the 100-word Congressional
takes in 200 Takes, the procedure would be about as follows:

1. Place on the blackboard the preview indicated for the first 200 words,
or approximately 2 minutes of the dictation, taking not more than 60 to 90
seconds to get the preview on the blackboard and to have a quick reading
drill. These previews are read as the teacher points quickly at random;
they are not written. _ '-

2. Dictate the ﬁrst 100 words in 1 minute. Have the pupils who got
the dictation raise their hands after each dictation. Each time that more
than half the pupils raise their hands, the piece may be redictated about
10 words a minute faster. -

3. Take perhaps 15 seconds to have the pupils reread the preview
quickly from the blackboard. ‘

4. Dictate in a minute 110 words—that is, the 100 words previously
dictated and an additional 10 Words. (A Conversion Table, showing how
material counted at one speed can be dictated at a higher or a lower speed,
is given on page 16.) Ask how many students got the dictation. Have
students read back.

5. Have the pupils read again from the blackboard the preview in not

_more than 10 to 15 seconds.

6. Redictate the material, this time 120 words in the minute.

7. Have the preview reread from the blackboard and redictate the
material, this time 130 words in the minute. All students may not get this
fourth dictation, but urge them to keep on and write as much as they can
get.

8. Repeat steps 1-7 for the next 200 words of the 5-minute dictation.

9. Then dictate at 120 to 130 words a minute the ﬁrst 400 words of the
take. Have students read back about half of this dictation.

10. Repeat steps l—7 for the next 200 words. (This will carry you part

way into the next take.) v_

agreed at the Crimea4 Conference that the military plans‘ completed‘
there in the closest co—operation by the chiefs of staff of the three powers
—and the continuing three-power staff meetings there providedfor—
will shorten the war and5 thus save the lives of tens of thousands of
United Nations ﬁghting men. .

Here at Mexico City the American republics have met to consider
What further steps we can take together to that same end—helping
to6 shorten the war.

The solid foundations of the wartime collaboration of the Ameri-
can republics Were laid at the conferences of Montevideo and Buenos
Aires in 1933 and7 1936, and at Lima in 1938.

We have acted together in accordance with the Declaration of
Havana that an act of aggression against any American state is8 an
act of aggression against all of us. -

The American republics since 1940 have succeeded together in
building up the defenses of‘ this hemisphere to an extent never before
dreamed of.9 Their military forces have co—operated in the War. They
have increased greatly the military might of the United States and
other United Nations armed forces through their production. . . .

each group in 17 seconds. The ﬁgures below 17 indicate the point on the watch where

have been carried through the first two minutes.

Schedule of Supplementary Dictation. The amount of sup-
plementary dictation for which the teacher will have time will depend,
of course, on the length of the class period, the number of times each
week the class meets, the amount of time devoted to the subject at
home by the student, and so on. The following table lists the take in
200 Takes which may be used with each assignment in Expert S/tort-
/zand Speed Course. The supplementary takes from 200 Takes for
Assignments 1 through _22 have been graded so that no shortcuts are
used that the student has not yet studied.

No supplementary take is assigned on the days that the high-speed
review takes are taken up. It is suggested that on those days the entire
period be devoted to building up speed on these review takes, to pro-
vide the student with an opportunity for automatizing the-shortcuts
that these takes contain.

Provision is also made for a test period every ten periods or so, at
which time students should be given either a practice new-matter test

or an official Gregg Speed Test.

If more supplementary material is needed, it can be obtained,
counted, from the two books, Dictation for Transcription and Dictation
at ln—Betu/een Speeds} Uncounted material can be obtained from the
Congressional Record, which may be obtained through your local
congressman or by subscription from the Government Printing Oﬂice
in Washington, D. C. The subscription price is $1.50 a month. Inas-
much as copies of the Congressional Record are delivered shortly after
each day’s session of Congress, the material they contain will enable
you to dictate material that is “hot off the griddle.” The material, how-
ever, is not counted and the type is rather small for dictation purposes.

CHAPTER IV
SUGGESTED LESSON PLAN

The time devoted to shorthand varies in different types of schools.
In high schools, shorthand classes generally meet ﬁve days a Week, the
period averaging 40 to 60 minutes, with a homework assignment of
equal length; in private business schools, two or more periods of 40
to 60 minutes a day are devoted to the subject, with a corresponding
homework assignment; in junior colleges and universities, two to ﬁve
days a week, with periods of 40 to 180 minutes, are devoted to short-
hand, plus homework assignments. Then, of course, in all three types
of schools, there are evening classes where still other time schedules
prevail.

Regardless of the time schedule under which your shorthand classes
must operate, every effort should be made to insure regularity of prac-
tice. The student who practices shorthand two or three days (or eve-

nings) a week and gets no practice the remaining days of the week ’

will do well if he retains what speed he has. His chances of making
any substantial gain under that practice schedule are slight. If the
school schedule will permit only two or three days or evenings a week
to be devoted to shorthand, students should be urged to utilize at home
the practice procedures suggested in the speed pointers in Assignments
12 and 33. In addition, they should be urged to form little practice
groups, meeting, if possible, at one another’s homes for extra dictation.

Assuming that your class is of 50 minutes’ duration, here is a typical
breakup of the time:

Theory Review, 3 minutes. This drill should be disposed of quickly,
as its primary purpose is to give the student a rapid recall of material
with which he is already familiar.

High-Speed Shortcuts, 3 minutes. The shortcuts can be presented
effectively in 3 minutes or less. They should be kept on the blackboard
and periodically reviewed through rapid reading in concert. After

19

Assignment 21, when all the shortcuts have been presented, this time
may be added to the dictation time. A

Derivatives, 2 minutes. These derivatives of the high—speed short—
cuts should also be left on the blackboard and reviewed occasionally

throughout the class period, along with the shortcuts themselves. After _

Assignment 21, this time may also be added to the dictation time.

Reading from previous day’s homework, 3 minutes. Have individ-
ual students read a sentence or two at the most, as a check on the
thoroughness with which they did the assignment.

Dictate according to Plan A or Plan B (described in Chapter III,
“Dictation”), 35 minutes. The material to be dictated will come from
this handbook or from the textbook itself or from the supplementary
take from 200 Take: suggested in the Schedule for New-Matter Dic-
tation. (See page 17 of this handbook.)

Review of shortcuts on pages 427-428 of the textbook, 2 minutes.

Give the students the preview of the more difﬁcult outlines in the
next day’s assignment, 2 minutes.

The foregoing schedule may be adapted to a shorthand ‘period of
any length by increasing the amount of time devoted to dictation.

CHAPTER v
VTESTING

Testing, when properly administered, should:

1. Show whether the student’s skill has increased, and thus enable
the teacher to gauge the dictation speed accordingly.

2. Serve as an incentive to the student to reach higher speeds.

Tests should not be given too often—most of the class time should
be devoted to teaching with previewed material. Tests given at short
intervals provide no signiﬁcant information, as the student’s skill has
had little time to grow between tests. Also, we should not overlook
the harmful psychological effect on the student that frequent failure
produces. The authors feel that a test every two or three weeks will
provide a suﬂicient check on the student’s progress.

20

Gregg Expert Shorthand Speed Tests. The most satisfactory
measure of a student’s shorthand skill is a test of 5 minutes’ duration,
such as the Gregg Expert Shorthand Speed Tests, which are issued
regularly by the Gregg Publishing Company. The expert tests at 120
and 140 words a minute are available monthly in the Gregg News
Letter. The tests at 160, 175, and 200 words a minute appear during
the months of November, Ianuary, March, May, Iune, and ]uly-
August, and will be sent by the Gregg Publishing Company on request.

These tests consist of 5 minutes of material that is dictated as new
matter——u/it/z no preview of any l(ind——-and marked only on the accu-
racy of the transcript. On the 120 test, the student is allowed one hour
to transcribe; on the 140 and 160, one hour and ﬁfteen minutes; on the
175 and 200, one hour and a half. ‘

Each student who passes the Gregg Expert Shorthand Speed Tests
within the prescribed time and with an accuracy of 95 per cent or
better is entitled to a Gregg award. At 120, the award is an attractive

’ certiﬁcate; at 140 and 160, a gold and enamel pin; at 175, a gold medal;

and at 200, a diamond medal. , .

These awards constitute one of the most powerful incentives known
to shorthand teaching. They provide a series of goals, not too far
apart, for the student to aim at. When a student wins one of these
awards, it not only creates in him an urge to work harder for the
next award, but it also stimulates renewed effort on the part of those
of his classmates who have not yet earned the award. The authors,
who have trained many diamond-medal winners, have used these

' awards in their Hunter College classes and recommend them highly.

Taking Shorthand Tests} As shorthand teachers, we have all
given shorthand tests by the score. But how many of us have taught
our students how to take a test?

It has been my experience that many students who fail Civil Service
tests or'placement-department tests or even the Gregg Shorthand Speed
Tests fail, not because they don’t possess the required skill, but because
they have not acquired the technique of taking tests. The technique
of taking a test should be taught to every pupil before he is turned
loose on the business world. I

A teacher may feel that a student should pass a test at a given
speed because he has always read back orally in class dictations at that
speed or perhaps at a higher speed. But the student’s oral reading may
not always be indicative of what he can do on a written test, as there
are many factors that must be considered in the written transcript that
do not come up in an oral reading back. For example:

1. A written transcript will show up such little mistakes as the mis-
transcription of in for at, oz for the, of for 0n—mistranscriptions that
can easily be slurred over in oral reading.

2. In a written transcript, the student must make a choice between
principle and principal; their and there,‘ correspondent: and corre-
5p0ndence—and you could probably add many more. If he chooses the
wrong one in the written transcript, he is charged with an error that
would not show up in oral reading. ‘

3. In oral reading in a shorthand class, the student seldom, if ever,
reads back an entire take. The factors of time and consideration for the
other students will not permit it. Consequently, while the part he
reads back may be perfect, the part that he does not read back may
be full of holes. These holes show up—oh, so painfully—on a writ-
ten test.

We must bear in mind that in a test the student must work under a
certain amount of tension—tension that even the most calm and staid
individual will experience. When he takes a test, he knows that he
must do a speciﬁc thing with a certain accuracy in a certain length of
time.

In preparing students to pass the Gregg Expert Shorthand Speed
Tests from 160 to 200 words a minute, I have found some of the
following points helpful:

1. Teach students the importance of checking up on their physical
tools, such as notebooks, pens, and ink, immediately before the test.

22

This sounds elementary, but it has been my sad experience to see ﬁne
writers lose out because they ran out of ink or paper in the middle of
a test. So:

~ (a) Suggest to students that they ﬁll their fountain pens immedi-
ately before taking a test. In addition, if they are wise, they will have
another fountain pen——or mechanical pencil, if another pen is not
available—-just in case the gremlins sabotage the ﬁrst pen.

(5) Have them check to see that they have ﬁve or six consecutive
clean pages in their notebook and that the pages are not stuck together,
so that they turn easily. One of my students caused himself a lot of
unnecessary grief on a test because he had forgotten that he had pre-
viously used a couple of pages in the middle of'his notebook. After he
had written part way through the test, he ran into three or four pages
that were already full. Before he ﬁnally got to a clean page, he was
well behind the dictator, and this upset him emotionally so that he
never did catch up! i

It is a simple matter to leaf through ﬁve or six pages of the notebook
immediately before taking the test. This foresight may save much
anguish during the test. V

In the days of the championship contests of the National Shorthand
Reporters Association, the experts went a step farther; they not only
looked to be sure that the pages on which they were going to W1‘ltC’

‘ were blank and that they turned easily, but they also examined each

page closely for specks in the paper that might be misread for dots.
They then encircled such specks lightly with a lead pencil.
2. Quite some time before the actual test, the student should be

A given an opportunity to take a number of sample tests under the iden-

tical conditions, if possible, under which the actual test will be admin-
istered. If he must transcribe the actual test in longhand, he should
transcribe the samples in longhand. If he will be given ﬁve minutes to
read over his notes before transcribing the actual test, he should be
given ﬁve minutes to read over his notes on the samples. If he will be
given a warmup on the actual test, he should be given a warmup on
the samples.

If the student is preparing for a Civil Service examination, he will
have to take the dictation of a strange voice; hence, to accustom him

23

to taking dictation from a voice he has not heard before, outsiders
might be invited to dictate occasionally—perhaps another teacher, or a
businessman, or even a student.

In other words, the student should experience every step of the
examination so that it is stripped of all possible elements of surprise.
He can then give his entire attention to the actual taking of the die-
tation. '

3. The student should be told what constitutes an error and what
does not; whether different weights are given to different kinds of
errors; whether spelling will be counted, and if so, whether a dictionary
will be available; whether longhand corrections may be made or
whether erasers must be used.

4. The student should understand that, if he can’t read an outline,
he should not linger over it overly long. By taking too much time to
decipher one or two words, he may ﬁnd that he hasn’t time to ﬁnish
the take. Whenever he can’t ﬁgure out an outline in a fairly short
time, he should go on with the take and come back later to the spot
that he can’t read. It is wise for the testee to have a watch on the desk
to keep himself constantly posted on how much time is left.

5. Perhaps one of the most important steps in taking a test is the
checking after the transcribing has been completed. Many testees are
so relieved at getting to the end of the test that they look with distaste
on going back over it ‘again. It is this checking that is often the un-
doing of those who fail.

I still recall with some bitterness the experience of one of my stu-
dents who took the 200 Gregg Expert Shorthand Speed Test. After
the dictation, he was all smiles; he was sure he had it this time. He
transcribed and handed in his paper fully ﬁfteen minutes before the
time was up.

As there was no premium for handing in the paper before the full
time had expired, I timidly suggested that he go over the paper once
more. But he felt that he had done all he could with the paper and
handed it in. You know what’s coming! When I corrected his paper,
I found that he had apparently taken his eye off his shorthand notes
at a certain word and when he returned it, it picked up that same
word three or four lines below the line on which he was transcribing.

24

When the smoke cleared away, he was charged with 22 errors——and
you don’t lose 22 errors at one clip and still pass an examination!
If there is no premium on time, insist that your students take every

minute that is available to them and utilize it in checking. If there

is a premium on time, a check—even though a cursory one—will still
pay dividends.

This procedure is suggested for checking:

Have your students place the index ﬁnger of their left hand on the
shorthand outline in the notebook; have them place the index ﬁnger

of their right hand on the transcription of that outline on the test‘

paper. Check eae/z outline in the shorthand notes against the written
transcript to be sure that every shorthand outline is represented in the
transcript. '

Tell your students that at no time—either in the original transcrip-
tion or during the checking—should they write over‘ their shorthand
notes. By writing over an outline that cannot be read, the student
destroys any possible chance he may have of deciphering it later.

General Comments. The student must realize that he cannot cram
for a shorthand examination. A student may be able in two or three
nights to swallow enough economics or history or mathematics to
enable him to pass an examination successfully in these subjects, but it
does not work that way in shorthand.

To pass a shorthand examination requires skill, and the develop-
ment of skill takes time! I see this demonstrated again and again in
my speed classes at Hunter College. Whenever a Civil Service exami-
nation at the reporting speeds is announced——usually several months
before the actual examination—students flock to my classes. When the
examination is over, they ﬂock away. Of course, the time to get into
trim for the test is months before it is announced. The practice that
the student obtains in the short time before the test is of little value
to him. In fact, during the week or two immediately preceding an
examination, the student might well rest and practice only enough
to keep his hand warmed up.

If_ time permits, overtrain the student. That is, if the test will be at,
say, 100‘ words a minute, train him to write perhaps 110 or 120 words
a minute—for a minute or two at least. The knowledge that he has

25

ten or twenty words more than the speed at which he will be tested
often relieves some of the nervousness that accompanies the taking of
a test. This reserve speed also enables him to catch up should he fall
behind becauseof an unusual word or the inability to hear.

I always warn students to maintain a 15—second silence after the
test has been dictated. This silence often gives those students with a
long memory a chance to get down sometimes as much as a sentence
at the end that they might otherwise lose. '

There are always some students who will tighten up at the very
mention of the word test. Consequently, the question has been raised
whether it might not be wise to “sneak up” on these students; that is,
instead of announcing that a given piece of dictation will be a test, just
dictate the material and have the students transcribe.

My own feeling would be against this procedure. Part of the train-
ing that we owe our stenographic student is to develop in him the
ability to work under pressure. By withholding the announcement that
a given dictation will be a test, we lose an opportunity to train him
along these lines.

Of course, no matter how well we train some students in the tech-
nique of test-taking they will never be able to pass—~they just won’t
have the skill that it takes!

CHAPTER VI

SHORTHAND WRITING POSTURE
AND HAND POSITION

Most teachers and pupils are much more concerned than they need
be about writing posture and hand position. One thing that has been
demonstrated by scientiﬁc research is that almost any writing posture
or hand position that is easy ‘and comfortable for the writer will give
good results.

It is true that one position or another has certain advantages, but
those advantages are dearly bought at the expense of any feeling of
strangeness or constraint while writing. Photographs in Expert Short-

26

hand Speed Course show the wide variations that may be found in the
writing posture and hand position of the most expert writers. If the
writing posture or hand position of the learner is within the rangeyof
differences shown in these illustrations, there is no need to attempt any
remedial work. ‘

These comments do not condone the slouchy position of the lazy
or inert student. Nor do they justify a position sometimes seen in the
classroom, in which the pupil rests his head wearily on one hand while
writing lackadaisically with the other. We wish to emphasize, how-
ever,'that, if the pupil has already acquired the habit of writing in a
certain position, any attempt to change that position is likely to do
more harm than good.

On page 55 of the textbook are shown the hand positions of two
world champions. Martin I. Dupraw won the championship three

times in succession; Charles Lee Swem won it -twice in succession. i

These two hand positions are given together because they show the
two extremes.

Mr. Swem keeps the wrist high, not permitting it to touch the
paper. The pen is held lightly between the thumb and ﬁrst ﬁnger.

The hand glides along on the nail and upper knuckle of the little‘

ﬁnger. The pen is kept almost in a vertical position.

Mr. Dupraw, on the contrary, permits the wrist and the whole side
of the hand to touch the paper and lets a large part of three ﬁngers.
touch the paper as the hand slides along. The back View of Mr. Du-
praw’s hand shows clearly that the little ﬁnger is tucked completely

.under the hand, whereas similar views of Mr. Swem’s hand show that

the little ﬁnger hardly touches the paper.

Notice how differently Mr. Swem and Mr. Dupraw hold a pen.
Mr. Swem holds his pen lightly, but deﬁnitely, between the thumb
and ﬁrst ﬁnger; whereas Mr. Dupraw allows his pen to rest in the
“step” formed between the ﬁrst and second ﬁngers and allows his
thumb to fall naturally part way up the barrel of the pen.

A careful study of the hand positions shown on page 151 of the
textbook will show that the three right—handed writers may be ar—
ranged in order on a graduated scale between the hand position used
by Mr. Dupraw and that used by Mr. Swem. Mr. Leslie’s position

27‘

is the nearest to that of Mr. Dupraw. Mr. Zoubek’s hand position is -

just about halfway between that of Mr. Dupraw and that of Mr. Swem.
Miss Pollmann’s hand position is much closer to that of Mr. Swem.

The photograph of Mr. Rifkin’s hand may be a source of amaze-
ment to those who have never seen an “upside down left-hander” in
action. His right hand and arm would ordinarily be holding the note—
book (he moved them aside for this picture) without changing the
writing position of the left hand and arm, as may be seen from a
study of Mr. Rifkin’s picture on page 430 of the textbook.

When a left—handed child is forced to keep his paper on the desk
at the same angle used for the right—handed writer, he is compelled
to write upside down. Having written in this fashion for ten years
or more, he is actually better off to continue doing so than to attempt
to break all the old habits and form new ones.

Mr. Rifkin’s picture has been included especially for the encourage-
ment of the upside down left—handed writer and also as a clinching bit
of evidence in conﬁrmation of the contention that the exact posture
or hand position is not too important. If the upside down left-hander
can write 200 words a minute successfully under that handicap, it is
diﬂicult to imagine any writing position that would make much dif-
ference for the’right—handed writer. Shorthand is written more with
the mind than with the ﬁngers, and the student’s attention must con-
stantly be kept on that fact without diverting his efforts toward
attempts at improvement of hand position that may actually do more
harm than good.

The illustrations on pages 315, 358, 410, 419, 426, and 430 show
these writers at their desks. Extended comment on their posture is
unnecessary because their posture follows closely their hand position.
Mr. Swem and Mr. Dupraw are again the two extremes.

Mr. Swem sits erect with his arms close to his body. Mr. Dupraw
bends over more than Mr. Swem and uses much more “elbow room”
while he is writing.’ The other writers again form a scale between
these two extremes.

Even these experts, however, will bend over more and more as the
speed gets higher and higher. Shorthand speed is relative. Therefore,
do not be alarmed if your students who are just beginning to write

28

I

120 start to get their noses pretty close to the paper. That 120 to them
is as much as 280 to Mr. Swem or to Mr. Dupraw; and it is perfectly
natural that the pupil, like the expert, should exhibit signs of distress
as the dictation gets too fast for comfort.

There is no one posture or hand position that is best for everyone.
The variations shown here are used by writers who are all experts.
The writing postures and hand positions vary greatly among these
experts. None of them, however, holds the pen tightly. The ﬁrst
ﬁnger always rests lightly on the pen and never “pinches” it. Pinching
the pen is fatal to high speed. '

Another thing in which these experts are all alike is a mastery of
shorthand. Each of these writers has automatized a large vocabulary
of shorthand outlines and, in addition, has acquired the ability quickly
to construct an acceptable outline for any new word. If your students
will do likewise, they will have no cause to worry about Writing pos-
ture or hand position.

CHAPTER VII
“GUEST” WRITERS

A feature that the authors feel will add much to the interest of this
course is the inclusion of specimens of the notes of prominent Gregg
writers who are using their shorthand in important posts. The notes
of these writers are used for the reading exercises in the latter part of
the book so that the student will have an opportunity to study the
distinctive, ﬂuent style of each Writer. 9

The notes were written in a regular Gregg Spiral—bound reporter’s
notebook; and, as was said previously, the actual page in the notebook
has been reproduced, slightly reduced, in the text.

Before these “guest” notes are assigned for home study, it is wise
to explain to the students that the outlines that these experts use are
not always the same as those in their textbook. This is because most
of them learned Gregg ‘Shorthand from early editions of the Gregg

29

S/zort/zand Manual, editions in which some outlines were not written as
they are in the Anniversary Edition, and in which some preﬁxes,
suﬂixes, brief forms, and principles were employed but omitted from
the Anniversary Edition. Having once thoroughly learned the out—
lines of the early editions, so that they are completely automatic, these
writers naturally continue to use them today.

Also, they have devised their own shortcuts for certain expressions
that are common in their work, although not frequent in other lines
of work. The student will ﬁnd a number of these “homemade” short-
cuts in the notes of the experts.

As the student may have a little difficulty “getting acquainted”
with the practical, ﬂuent notes of the experts, the teacher may wish to
spend a few minutes in class in a study of the notes before they are
assigned for home study. It might be desirable to place on the black-
board the words and phrases for which the experts use outlines dif-
ferent from those in the text. A list of these outlines follows.

in Assignment 80. Inasmuch as the notes are on testimony and jury-
charge material, and consequently contain a goodly number of short-
cuts commonly used in the reporting of that ‘type of material, the key
for the entire exercise has been included in the textbook. No preview,
therefore, need be given.

CHAPTER VIII
GENERAL SUGGESTIONS‘

1. Substitute shorthand for longhand. The personal use of short-
hand is one of the most potent shortcuts for building shorthand skill
for vocational use. The student who uses shorthand in his personal
writing adds to the daily period of shorthand instruction and the usual
home—study period a considerable amount of time spent in writing and
reading shopping lists, diaries, memoranda, lectures, and the like,
written in shorthand.

2. Eliminate pen pinching. One of the most serious drawbacks to
high speed is pen pinching. The bad effects of pen pinching as a rule
do not become evident until the student approaches the higher speeds.
Then they are felt in a tightening of the muscles in the entire arm,
which makes writing not only difficult but also painful. Pen pinching
is easy to remedy. The easiest way is to wind around the knuckle of

the index ﬁnger of the writing hand several inches of gauze——just
tightly enough to keep that knuckle from bending.

The elimination of pen pinching will do much to increase the
student’s writing comfort.

3. Make no eﬁort to standardize the size and slant of your students’
notes. Any effort to mold the writing style of your students into one
standard size is likely to retard the progress of some and set up a
hurdle that may always impede their writing speed. You will notice

by a comparison of the notes of the experts in Assignments 76-80,

that each writer has individual peculiarities of style that the others do
not possess. . -

Some writers naturally write a small style of shorthand; others, a
large style. Any style is satisfactory as long as it can be written com-
fortably and legibly by the writer. - ‘

4. Vary your daily speed—building lessons. It is very easy for the
advanced shorthand teacher to teach the same way day after day,
changing only his dictation material. Both teacher and students, how-
ever, become weary from this constant repetition of the same proce-
dure. Monotony retards speed.

5. Increase your students’ power to concentrate. Psychologists tell
us that the average person ﬁnds it diﬂicult to concentrate upon a single
subject for more than two or three minutes. This perhaps accounts for
the fact that many students who can transcribe accurately the ﬁrst two
or three minutes of a 5-minute dictation fall down ‘on the ﬁnal two
minutes. An important step in building up the student’s concentra-
tion to the point where he will not lose out in the ﬁnal minutes is to
see that he is exposed regularly and often to 5-minute dictations. The
student should take advantage of every means possible to take 5—min-
ute dictations outside of class, to supplement those given in class.

6. Write one more word every three seconds. If you can write at
the rate of 120 words a minute, how difficult do you think it would be

for you to write 1 more word every 3 seconds? Would you need to

know any more shorthand? The additional word would not neces-
sarily be a diﬂicult word; it might be a brief form or just an average
word. That is all you would have to do to increase your speed from
120 words a minute to 140 words a minute.

32

When you write 120 words a minute, you write 2 words a second
or 6 words every 3 seconds. To increase that speed to 140 words, you
must write 20 more words a minute, or 1 more word every 3 seconds.
Instead of writing 6, you would write 7 words every 3 seconds.

Stated this way, the problem of increasing the student’s speed from
120 to 140 words a minute is not diﬂicult. ~

7. Dictate sympathetically and clearly. Remember that when you
are dictating, you are teaching. When you are developing speed, the
dictation should be smooth and clear, without any undue emotion or
attempt at oratory; otherwise the students’ attention may be distracted
from their writing to the subject matter of the material or to your ora-
torical outbursts.

8. Have no more than half the dictation read back in class. Every
minute spent in reading in class is a minute that can be used for dicta-
tion. Consequently, a minimum of reading back should be done in
class——just enough to be sure that students put forth their maximum
efforts on each take, never knowing what part they may be called
upon to read back. No more than half of any take need be read
back.

9. Be a constant inspiration to your students. Inspiration is a power-
ful aid in teaching. Often the “mediocre” student will accomplish
wonders mainly because he has been highly motivated by an enthusi-
astic teacher; and, contrariwise, a “bright” student will fail miserably
because of indifferent, uninspired teaching.

Constantly keep a not—too-diﬂ-icult-to-reach objective before the stu-
dents; and, through encouragement and inspiration, help them attain
that objective. Whenever possible, demonstrate the skill you are teach-
ing. Nothing creates more conﬁdence in the teacher than the knowl-
edge on the part of the students that the teacher can not only preach,
but can also practice what he preaches!

10. Change your methods for evening-school teaching. Iust a few
thoughts for teachers teaching high-speed shorthand in evening school:
The methods used in teaching high-speed shorthand in day school,
where the students are fresh and arenot, as a rule, burdened with
other responsibilities, may not work with more mature students who
have put in a full day on their job and who are generally tired by the

33

time they get to class in the evening but who, nevertheless, are willing
to put in the time and energy and often a considerable amount of
money to improve. The study of any subject after a day’s work is a
drain on a student’s energy; this is especially true in high—speed short-
hand, where the student must constantly strain every muscle, every
sinew, every nerve, to increase his speed. .

Consequently, the night—school high-speed shorthand teacher must
be a constant source of inspiration and encouragement, especially on '
those tiring nights when the student has had a diﬂicult day on the job
and comes to class “washed out.” This is not always easy, especially
when the teacher himself has had a diﬂicult day on /22': day job!

Here are a few do’s and don’ts, based on experience!

1. Don’t be cross when students don’t hand in homework assign-
ments. Urge the desirability of doing them, but don’t lose too much
sleep when they are not handed in!

2. Don’t be cross when students-

a. Come late to class.

b. Leave early.

c. Yawn at you during the entire period.
d. Fall asleep.

3. Don’t let them puzzle too long on outlines they cannot read.
Prompt them fairly quickly—it is not fair to keep the whole class wait-
ing while one student struggles with an outline.

4. Give frequent rest periods, especially if the class period is an
hour or longer.

5. Take time out for a good story every now and then—-it helps
ease tension and does wonders to morale! .

6. In night—school teaching, the students must be kept satisﬁed and
happy—they are footing the tuition bill!

7. Always try to send the students home with the feeling that they
have written a little faster, even if only for half a minute.

8. Help your students in every way you can. Real teaching means
helping, not testing.

Mr. President, in this crucial era of American history it is necessary
that the people be intelligentlyl informed, so that they may be fortiﬁed

' in approaching crucial problems. More than half of our citizens reside

on farms or in small commmzitiesz which are served by weekly news-
papers. These weekly newspapers have a greater inﬂuence over farmers
than any other media.3

Weekly newspapers go into nearly every farm home in America.
They are more closely read by the farmer‘ than any other4 publication
which he receives. Unquestionably the effect they have on formulating
the opinions of farmers is tremendous.5 In this respect they are pos-
sessed of a great privilege and a great opportunity. They are in a posi-
tion to influence the6 American farmer for good or ill as is no other
instrument in our land.

25’s] 35

Over 53.6 per cent of our people are either7 farming or are directly
dependent on farm trade for a livelihood. Here is the place where
most of the new wealth of the Nation is8 created. National prosperity
is dependent on the production of this wealth. A

The foundation of this prosperity lies among these9 53.6 per cent— I

the very people who are served by most of the weekly press.

Anything which assists the production of this wealth“) and the
prosperity of this segment of our people is to the national beneﬁt, while
that which retards its production will not only“ destroy the prosperity
of 53.6 per cent but will also bring disaster upon the whole Nation.

As obvious as” it is, and as simple as it sounds, many in our urban
centers fail to recognize these basic truths. They contend that our
prosperity” depends on cheap food, often priced below cost, without
regard to the effect on the 53.6 per cent who are the very foundation”
of prosperity. These people are the last stronghold of our free-enter—
prise system. Here is found our strongest opposition to centralization“
of Government.

Unfortunately, moreioften than not the great metropolitan papers
and national news magazines have not” understood the problems and
the diﬂiculties which our farmers are facing. Radio commentators with
a city background also have” failed to appreciate what American
agriculture has done to maintain our American manner of life.

Consequently, the thousands” of weekly newspapers throughout
the Nation must carry the burden of telling the truth aboutthe prob—
lems of our basic industry :19 Agriculture.

During these years the threat to our constitutional government is
growing day by day. The danger from external foes has welded us
together.”

What counts in knowledge is that which you learn after you reach

' the point where you know ‘it all.

6. Building High Speed Through Reading

RADAR

In the ﬁnal stages of the great victory that our naval forces won in
the battle of the Solomon Islands in the South Paciﬁc} one of our

36 [25’s

battleships was standing by waiting for the next phase of the action.
In its radio room, the operator was occupied” with his instruments,
when suddenly he announced to his superior_ ofﬁcer that there was a
lap ship 8 miles out; and he gave the3 exact position of the ship. In
no time at all, the battleship’s big guns were elevated and aimed, and
on the second salvo the,]ap4 ship was sunk. -

How did that radio operator know that the ]ap ship was present?
How could he tell so accurately where it was that the5 guns of his ship
were able to hit it on the second try? The answer is radar—short for
radio detection and ranging——one of the6 greatest developments of the
war. Here, are a few of the miracles that radar performs:

1. It transmits a screen of radio waves from7 shores, ships, and
military positions. It is impossible for the enemy to launch an attack
through this screen without being detected.8

2. It ﬁnds targets that cannot be seen by the human eye when these
targets are hidden by darkness or clouds.

3. It aims naval guns at” targets that the gunner cannot see, deter-
mining the range to those targets.

4. Itmakes possible the ﬁring of those guns at the corr_ect1° split

l second to insure hits or near misses on their targets, making full allow-

ance for movement of the target and atmospheric variations.“

5. It shows bombing planes where they are going and the broad out-
lines of the terrain that lies below them, even when the earth’s surface
is” hidden by night or clouds.

6. Coupled with automatic pilots, it makes possible the ﬂying of

. planes to invisible targets.

7.13 Coupled with bomb sights, it makes possible the release of
bombs at the precise second to insure remarkably accurate bombing.

8. Radar“ performs its ﬁnal miracle by showing the pilots the road
home, leading them in for blind ﬂying and the landings on home air—-
ports at night” or when visibility on the ground may be zero. (385

10. High-Speed Take No. 2—Home Ownership *

Mr. Speaker, it has been my privilege for the past two months to

_-give a considerable part of my time to the study of this1 legislation;

.and I am frank to admit that, to begin with, I held considerable doubt
as to its desirability and soundness. However, the2 further I went into
.a study of the bill and the more thought and consideration I gave its
purpose, the stronger I began to feel3 that the bill was Worth while.
I therefore ﬁnd myself now strongly in favor of the bill. It is the last
item in the President’s program for4 economic development and is, in
my opinion, the best proposal which has been suggested by him as far
as the ordinary5 citizen is concerned.

With certain improvements to be oﬁ'ered by the committee, I can
recommend the bill to you as socially and“ economically sound and
«desirable. It gives us the opportunity to carry out what we have been
preaching with respect to our faith7 in home ownership and its whole-
some eﬂect upon American life. Protection to the home means protec-
tion to the Nation. Wreck it and8 you wreck the structure which has
been erected through years of planning. Remember, without the home
‘there is nothing left worth while.

This bill is designed’) primarily to foster the development of the
American home. No elaboration is needed to show the importance
of them home in our social, political, and economic life. It is universally
recognized that one of the fundamental steps to” be followed in pro-
moting progress in this country is to foster home ownership in every
possible manner.

The ambition of12 every worthy American is to be a home owner.
It is our obvious duty, as representatives of the Nation, to provide”
the means whereby this ambition may be realized. It is an idle waste
of words and time for us to stress the desirability” of home ownership
in one breath and in the next leave the home owner to struggle with
the threat of foreclosure in times of business depression.” We cannot,
in fairness to the citizen, urge him to become a home owner without
attempting to protect and safeguard him in that” ownership as far as
possible.

Home ownership cannot be encouraged on a short—term credit
basis. The complaint of commercial bankers" today that their real-

38 [252

estate loans are frozen emphasizes the need for adequate credit facili-
ties. "

It is obvious that, i credit is to be most economically advanced to
the‘ home owner, it must not be for 60 days or 90 days, or 1 year” or 3
years or 5 years. The ordinary purchaser of a home cannot expect to
be able to pay off the loan completely in that tirne.2°

RADAR (C onzinued )

Just what is radar and how does it work? A complete radar station
consists of a combination transmitter and receiver. The transmission1
portion sends out high—frequency waves that travel at the speed of
light——186,000 miles a second. These waves travel until2 they strike an
interfering object, which may be a plane, a ship, a shore line, or even
a tall building. The waves then “bounce back” to the radar3 receiver
and indicate the shape of the interfering object on the radar “scope.”
The image is not perfect, but it is suﬂ5ciently4 clear so that the operator
can determine whether the object is a plane or a flock of planes, a ship
or a ﬂeet of ships. Each5 object will be a separate speck on the scope.
The time that it is necessary for the waves to travel to the interfering
objects and return to the receiver can be accurately measured and
instantly translated into the distance of that object from the7 receiver.

United States Army and Navy radar operators got in some of the
ﬁrst effective licks with their new superweapon ins the Solomons.
They were able to spot enemy ships and planes and thus enable our
gunners to be ready for them. During one battle,9 radar operators dis-
covered enemy planes approaching. United States planes were sent
out to meet them. The operators were able1° to follow the entire battle
in their scopes. They could see the planes mixing it up; they could
even see the bombs explode. They had a ringside seat” to a battle
being fought a number of miles OE.

Postwar uses of radar and the radar principles are even more fan-
tastic than” its wartime applications.

Radar will become an absolutely essential piece of equipment, per-
haps even more valuable than” a compass, on every ship at sea. Radar
will pierce night and fog, so that a, ship will be able to locate accu—

25’s] 39

rately icebergs, shore” lines, and other ships on its course. The danger
of collision will thus be almost eliminated for all ocean traﬂic.

Further, radar” will be able to guide ships safely into fog—bound
harbors; and that old curse of ships—having to lie at anchor outside
a harbor mouth, sometimes” waiting days at a time for the fog to lift
—will disappear as a shipping hazard and delay. At sea, ships in a fog
will not have to" slow down their engines. Radar will permit them to
proceed at normal speeds. Even small craft on the Great Lakes, on
the larger rivers, or in coastal” waters may ﬁnd the investment of a
few hundred dollars in a postwar radar set well worth while as a
safety device for night or19 bad-weather navigation. (480 standard

15. High-Speed Take No. 3—Civi1 Service

Mr. Speaker, I have introduced a bill which, in my opinion, will go
very far toward correcting a defect that has existed in1 the operation of
the civil service laws for a long time.

The bill has for its purpose the creation of a Civil Service Court of2
Appeals, a tribunal to which any civil service employee may appeal
when, in his opinion, he is unjustly cut in salary,3 suspended, or re-
moved from the service. I

The creation of such a court would not only strengthen the civil
service law but would also4 inspire the employees with conﬁdence. The
employees would know that not only would they be supplied with a
copy of the charges inf’ writing and given an opportunity to answer
them, but also they would be given an opportunity to examine all
the“ evidence.

Under existing conditions civil service employees have charges pre-
ferred aguinst them in writing, and they answer such charges7 to their
immediate superior. Too often, after the employees have answered the
charges, additional accusations ares made of which the accused em-

40 [25’s

\

ployee has no knowledge whatsoever. Of course, when the matter
reaches the head of the department and no answers9 are found to these
accusations, the natural assumption is that the employee is guilty and
has no answer to make. In many” cases the ﬁnal decision on the mat-
ter is influenced by the failure of the employee to answer fully all the
charges and” accusations. “ i

_ This situation has been one which has given the employees a great
deal of concern for some time. They feel that, as the Government”
has safeguarded itself by throwing very rigid requirements around
their entrance into the civil service, the Government should see” to it
that there is an impartial body to whom they could appeal if anunjus-
tiﬁed attempt were made to cut them in salary,“ suspend them, or
remove them from the service.

It seems manifestly unfair and unjust that any employee should be
cut, suspended, or15 dismissed on the judgment of one person, regard-
less of how fair that person might be. The employee should have the
right to have the evidence” in the matter reviewed by an unbiased
board whose decision would be ﬁnal.

It is my conviction that, when this suggested Civil Service" court
had rendered its decision, all parties concerned would be satisﬁed.
This procedure would have a tendency to create a feeling of“ good
will and bring about a better understanding between the workers and
their employer, the Government of the U nitea’ States.

Charges,” as a rule, originate with the employee's superior; and,
after the charges are answered, they are sent to the head of the depart-
ment.2°

For postwar commercial and private ﬂying, radar will have even
Wider applications. At airports, the presence of all approaching planesl
may be detected by radar. In airport control towers, planes will be
seen on the radar scopes even in bad weather or at night, and the2
progress of planes coming into the field from all angles can be watched.

PREFACE

The textbook, Expert Shorthand Speed Course, is the crystallization
of the teaching plans and materials that the authors have used success-
fully in training shorthand students to pass the Gregg Expert‘ Short-
hand Speed Tests at 140 through 200 words a minute in the Evening
Session of Hunter College of the City of New York over a period of
more than ten years. The material used for the high—speed takes and
the reading exercises represents the cream of literally millions of words
of material on a great variety of subjects. The material used will be
just as “up to date” ten years from now as it is today.

As evidenced by the number of Gregg Expert Shorthand Speed
awards that have been issued in the last few years, a good many schools
already have classes set up to bring students to the expert stages. Those
schools will welcome the textbook, Expert Shorthand S peed Course, as
it will provide them with fresh dictation and homework material
organized into deﬁnite assignments. The authors hope that the publi-

-cation of Expert Shorthand Speed Course will encourage other schools

to institute high—speed courses and thus train stenographers and secre-
taries who will be equipped to handle the highest types of shorthand
positions.

The authors are conﬁdent that, with the aid of the suggestions

’ given in this Teacher’s Handbook, any teacher who has been successful

in bringing students up to 100 words a minute or beyond can teach the
course. The authors will be happy to assist any school interested in
organizing such a high—speed course.

trol3 tower may signal some of them to circle the ﬁeld until others have
landed.

Radar makes itvpossible for the control tower to4 know exactly
where every plane is even when the pilots themselves are lost,

The use of radar for bringing planes in for blind landings at5 night
or in zero visibility has already been developed to a high degree in
military flying. This use of radar“ will be developed further after the
war.

Also, radar installations in the planes themselves will be more and
more essential as commercial7 aviation develops, in order to prevent
collisions. Radar will give pilots and copilots an extra pair of eyes,
which cans see in all directions at the same time and report the presence
of all planes within the horizon of the plane, The radar scope will
show planes9 above, below, ahead, behind, on the side-—and~, further-
more, which direction they are going.

Radar, in fact, is the one device that, as an” aid to navigation and
as a control over traﬁic, will make it possible to ﬁll the skies with
planes without the constant danger of“ their crashing into one another.

For transoceanic air-line operation on regular scheduled ﬂying, radar
offers the perfect” answer for planes cruising above the clouds to dis-
tant airports, just as long—range bombers now ﬁnd their targets on
bombing raids.

In its present13 stage of development, radar does not aid aerial navi-
gation over land to the same extent that it does navigation over” the
‘ocean. Details of landmarks do not show so plainly on the radar
scopes as do ships at sea. - Further improvement may, however, over-
come” this diﬂ-iculty and give to radar the perfection of detail found
in television. '

Other land applications of radar are” being worked out in the
scientists’ brains for useful postwar projects. Radar can be used on
railroads to control traﬂic. It can catch bank robbers," match false
teeth, inspect razor blades—make your own list.

The industry is developed and ready to go. It was created during
the war,” one of the most constructive things to come out of the war.

20. High-Speed Take No. 4-—Parliamentary Procedure

Mr. Speaker, I have not forgotten the oath that I took as a Repre-
sentative of the people of this Nation to support the1 Constitution of
the United States. '

As soon as I ﬁnd a bill before this body that I believe is unconstitu-
tional, from that time2 on you will find me strenuously opposing it.
There was a time when I voted for some measures that I thought were
unconstitutional.‘°’ You could not stop them by a point of order, be-
cause under our rules that is a matter for the House to decide by its
vote. It is a matter4 for the Supreme Court ultimately to decide under
our system of Government.

I realized that the President of the U nited5 States was elected by the
people to carry out a certain program. I felt that our President was
entitled to have a chance to“ put his policies into effect. When bills
were brought up here that I felt were unconstitutional, I voted for
them; but I am not going7 to do so any more. The time has come

when Members must vote in accordance with their judgment on these '

bills, and that is exactly what I8 expect to do in the future.

I have no apologies to make toranybody for doing anything and

everything to stop9 this bill, because I know that it is unconstitutional.

Mr. Speaker, who has been fair about this business? The gentle-
man from New Yorl{1° has been here a long time. He is one of the
most valuable legislators who ever sat on the floor of this House. He

_is one of then most valuable Members on that side of the House. He

did what he sincerely thought was his duty under his oath to stop this
bill, whether” it took roll calls or not. We Members who have been
here a long time, and who know the business of this House, know that

Mr. Speaker, when this matter first came up, we went to the gentle—
man from Pennsylvania and tried to” have a fair division of time in
order to discuss this measure properly. We could not get an agree-

our only recourse. We were determined that this bill should be fully

Mr. Speaker, again today we tried to get a reasonable agreement

OUR CONSTITUTION

The American Constitution is today the oldest written constitution
in the world. It has served as the model for many other1 constitu-
tions since adopted. It has been copied both in Europe and in the
Americas. At the time of its adoption it was2 unique; it was based on
a new conception of the relationship existing between those who gov-
ern and those who are governed.

The framers?’ of the older constitutions had proceeded on the theory
that the ultimate power resides in the government, and that the people4
have only such rights and privileges as the government, through the
constitution, is willing to grant or is forced to yield.

The men who sat5 in Philadelphia in 1787 had an entirely different
idea. They drew their inspiration from the revolutionary“ doctrine
enunciated in the Declaration of Independence that “all governments
derive their just powers from the consent7 of the governed.”

Sovereignty, they held, resides in the people. Governmental pow~
ers originate in the people, and a governments therefore can exercise
only such powers as the people yield. Thus, while other constitutions
had been grants from the government to the people,9 ours was a grant
from the people to the government. Consequently, the government
formed by the Constitution was one of limited” powers.

In order to safeguard the liberties of the people, the framers of the
Constitution set up a system of checks and balances“ by distributing

44 [253

the powers of government among three distinct departments. They
were determined to preserve the gains the people had” won by hun—
dreds of years of struggle, and therefore they were careful to enu-
merate the separate powers of the three departments of13 government.
The fathers then wrote into the Constitution a bill of rights. They
ﬁxed boundaries beyond which the people ‘themselves could not go
in” transgressing upon the freedom of the individual.

So today, if we follow the fathers and heed the Constitution that
they wrote,” we shall put an end to the wholesale conﬁscation, regi-
mentation, and destruction of our social and economic order. We

' shall” seek to answer our social questions, not in the dead leveling of

society but in the removal of artiﬁcial handicaps” and the withdrawal
of special privileges; we shall ﬁnd the solution of our economic prob-
lem, not in tearing down our neighbor’s18 house, but in building one
of our own. There is enough sporting blood in every American to
make him willing to assume a risk if” he is given a fair ﬁeld where
he may receive just reward for his labors.

There are some who have declared that the “horse and buggy”
Constitution” adopted in 1787 is outmoded and that we should ex
change it for an up—to-date model. Those who offer the” suggestion

and thereby inferentially offer themselves for the role of Constitution _

maker cannot claim the trait of modesty.

They” are bold men who would venture to write a new basic law
to ﬁll the place of the one framed by that galaxy of statesmen that by
the grace of23 God or by an unusual fortuity was. assembled at Phila-
delphia more than 150 years past.

It is said that, on“ the night before his departure for the Far East
on his career of conquest, Alexander of Macedon had an interview with

‘his tutor,25 Aristotle, and that Aristotle said to his pupil: “You are

about to embark_ upon a great enterprise that will lead you into”
many lands and amongst many peoples, some already celebrated in
arts and in arms, some savage and unknown. This last counsel I27
give you, that whithersoever your victories lead_ you, do not forget that
you are a Greek.” '

America needs the advice of Aristotle” today.

25. High-Speed Take'No. 5——Taxation

Mr. President, I fully appreciate the diﬂiculty that confronts any
man who is not a tax expert and who has not spent1 his whole life
in writing and interpreting tax bills when he attempts to understand a
complicated tax bill.

I think I speak the truth when2 I say that all of us regret that it
was necessary. to consider a tax bill at this session of Congress. I,
myself, in one or3 two public statements at thebeginning of this ses-
sion, said that I did not believe any new tax law would be required at
this session of4 Congress in order to meet the requirements of the
Government.

We were unable, however, to foresee what either the Congress of
t}ze5 United States or the Supreme Court of the United States would
do. This bill is here because of the action of the Supreme Court of the“
United States in a certain case with which we are all familiar, and of
the action of the Congress of the United States in the passage7 of new
legislation that will require immediate appropriations.

Those who heard or read the message of the President will recalls
that he set out in detail the needs of the Treasury for both permanent
and temporary increases in the revenues of the” Government. Neither
the House bill nor the Senate bill attempted to raise as much money
as the President requested in his message to the” Congress.

The House bill did provide necessary permanent revenue and also
provided the temporary revenue for one year.“ The President, how—
ever, had suggested that this temporary revenue be spread out over a
period of three years at therate” of about $170 million* a year. The
House bill provided the permanent revenue over and above the

amount” now being collected or estimated for this year as the income
of ‘the United States Treasury.

It will be recalled that the” President, in his message, called atten—
tion to the fact that a large number of corporations in the United
States were, as a matter of15 fact, escaping taxation by reason of their
failure to distribute any of their earnings or any large proportion of
their earnings.” By the refusal of these corporations to make distribu-
tion of their income to their stockholders, the United States Govern-
ment was” consequently losing a large amount of revenue.

What the President of the United States was seeking in his sug-
gestion, and what the House” was seeking in its bill, was to provide
a tax system by which the total earnings of all corporations would pay
into the Treasury” the same amount that the Treasury would collect
if all their earnings were distributed. '

I grant that the proposal was a new one.”

THE Goon MEN Do

How often have you heard the saying, “The evil that men do lives
after them; the good is oft interred with their bones”?
It is not for me to quarrel1 with Shakespeare. But it has always

seemed to me that Shakespeare went wide of the mark when he

penned that cold and somber line, for the philosophy2'it expresses
denies the very history of man’s long and agonizing climb out of
darkness. It is also at variance with the?’ personal stories of the devoted
men and women who have led us in that climb.

You need but to run down the list. The names that sing from4
history’s pages are the names of men of good will who, forgetful of
themselves, dedicated their lives to worth—while ideals. Their good
deeds remain5 to give us heart for what is ahead. I L

George Washington had little to gain when he threw in his lot
with the Revolution. Washington was of6 the Colonial aristocracy. He
had assured position, respect, and money enough for his needs. The
Revolution could not adVance7 his personal fortune, but might well
destroy it. Defeat——-and the odds often seemed insurmountable-
would bring ostracism and contempt,8 the loss of all heheld dear, and

25’s] 47

perhaps death. He did not hold back. He threw everything in the
scales. In so doing, he brought a great nation9 into being. The shrines
and monuments erected to his memory are only outward symbols of
esteem. The centuries may erase” them. But so long as Americans sur-
vive, his memory will remain fresh and alive. The good he did lives
after him. V

Lincoln could have let“ the tide carry him. He might have com-
promised. If he had, he probably would have escaped agony of heart
and soul. He might even have been” spared a martyr’s death. But
his simple nobility kept him to his great task. Has the good he
Wrought been forgotten? Go to Washington and watch” people
standing reverently before his statue to ﬁnd solace and courage.

These men won through. But success is not the measure of great-
ness.” Many great men did not attain their goals. Some faltered on
the way. Some failed greatly and tragically. Yet it is what they tried
to do that counts.” For example, I have had occasion in the last two
years to familiarize myself thoroughly with the career of Woodrow
Wilson. In” one sense he, too, was a failure. He failed at a crucial
time in the history of his country and the world. He went out of
oﬂice a broken” man. The ideal for which he had fought, a world
organized for peace, lay in the dust. His countrymen had turned
against him. But his spirit did” not waver. And he did not ﬁght and
die in vain. The leaders of the world and the great mass of human-
kind have come to realize the greatness” of his spirit and the im-
mensity of his dream for a peaceful world. He is now in the gallery
of immortals.

Goodness is never2° lost—no matter who performs it, or where.

I Your name may not live in history books——but your inﬂuence can live

in the memories of your“ family, your friends, and your community.
Whether he is a success or a failure, every man has the opportunity to
leave that” great heritage. He can light the path to a better world.

30. High-Speed Take No. 6-Taxation

Mr. President, perhaps the most satisfactory income-tax law is that
in force in England. I am not citing it for the purpose‘ of commend-
ing it to the Congress. Not at all. I am citing it for another reason.
Under the English tax law, it does not matter2 actually whether the
earnings of a corporation are all distributed or whether they are not
distributed. The tax paid by3 the‘ individual stockholder is the same
as the tax paid upon the earnings if withheld by the corporation. Bear
in mind that England4 has had long experience with her tax laws, and
hear in mind also that on the whole they have worked very satisfac-
torily. I '

I5‘ now come to a point which in my opinion the Treasury officials
have not properly considered. It is a point which it seems to me“ they
either overlooked or did not properly weigh. The English corpora-
tions have withheld a greater percentage of their earnings than the7
American corporations. How is that accounted for? It is accounted
for by one fact: dividends or earnings are notpnecessarilys withheld for
the purpose of tax avoidance; they are withheld because, as a matter
of judgment and of sound business, it is of actual9 proﬁt in the admin-

.istration of the corporations to do so. Let the Senate bear that fact in

mind. Under the nearest“) comparable system to ours, there is no

inducement to avoid taxes because the tax on the earnings must be -

paid if they are distributed“ to the individuals, and it must be paid by
the corporation if the earnings are withheld. Indeed,‘ under the Eng—
lish system,” the tax in principle is charged by the corporation to the
individual. There are some adjustments; but their rates do not pre-
sent reasons” for tax avoidance, as in our case. I freely confess that.
However, the point I make is that in England there is a greater with-
holding” of corporation earnings than in the United States. Hence,
it cannot rightly he concluded that all corporate earnings are with-
held” for the purpose of avoiding taxes. It is a well—known fact, of
course, that some are. If it were possible to single out corporations,”
and if it were possible to make a rule which would be applicable to
those who withhold earnings for the purpose of avoiding taxes," no
one would object.

But I repeat that no study has been made which will enable the

25’s] A 49

committee or the Senate of the United States” to reach any fair con-
clusion carrying into effect the principle stated in the House bill. No
suﬂicient study of the entire” matter has been made up to the present
time. No complete picture of the corporate structure in this country
has been laid before us to date.2°

“You can’t live in that tangled mess of wilderness,” said the people
who came down to the docks to see them off in 1620.

“Sez who?” said the1 Americans-to—be—and did it.

“You can’t ignore my taxes,” said a king, not many years later,
“even though you had no voice in framing2 them.”

“Sez who?” said the Americans of 1776-and set off the most
momentous revolution in history.

“You can’t3 keep that hemisphere all for yourselves,” said a big
European coalition. “You’ve got to cut us in.”

“Sez who?” said the Americans of4 1823——and announced the
Monroe Doctrine.

“You can’t unite east and west,” said the shortsighted. “They are
too far apart.”

“Sez who?” said the5 Americans of 1869—and threw a railroad
across the continent.

“You can’t pay laborers 60 cents an hour,” some said.

“Sez who?”6 said the twentieth-century mass—pr0duetion Ameri-

cans. And proceeded to pay labor even more.

“You can’t get over the Depression,” said some weak ones. “Amer-
ica is mature, It is full grown. All you can do now is divide what you
already have.”

And Americans—8a little frightened, a little timid—made no an-
swer. _Until three dictators, seeing our plight, said, “America is degen-
erate,9 anemic, afraid.”

35. High-Speed Take No. 7—Taxation ‘

Mr. Chairman, like my good friend from Texas, I am not proud.
I learned long ago that, if I were against a bill a committee brought
out, it1 was a diﬂicult matter to get time from the majority side of the
committee. So I usually go over2 to the minority side, because I believe
in trying to present my views. Today I was rewarded by their cour4
tesy and received3 some time to oppose this measure, although denied
such time by the Democratic side.

Mr. Chairman, I voted against this bill the last4 time it was up here

_ for consideration; and I intend to vote against it this time. I cannot

begin to compete with the arguments5 of some Members in reference

' to the technicalities of tax liability. Personally, I feel that most of the

arguments6 are designed to confuse the issue. I do not think that, if
We pass this legislation, we take away a right from the States that they
now enjoy.7' I think I am enough of a Democrat to oppose ta/(in g any
more rights from the States. As a matter of fact, I would like to sees
the States get back some of the rights that have been taken away from
them in the last 10 years. That is the only principle upon which I
am9 going to vote against the bill.

25’s] 51


Mr. Chairman, the thing that interested me today was the pro-
cedure by which this issue is again” raised in this House. I was under
the impression that we had disposed of this matter previously. I ﬁnd,
however, that, even though I11 have once registered my vote on this
same issue and same principle, it is brought up again. If I had not
been here to protect my record,” I would have been placed in the
unfair position of not standing by my record and principles in this
bill. I would like to know about the1‘°’ procedure. Supposing the same
procedure were followed by all committees that has been followed in
the case of this bill. Suppose that the“ committee of which I am a
member bring: up a bill for consideration in this House and it is
defeated. Suppose further we have in” the committee a similar Senate
bill. Suppose we wait until all the Members. who voted against our
bill are absent from the House and” then bring it up again. The impli-
cation is quite obvious, and the result, is quite obvious, although the
result would not be the true” voice of the House.

Mr. Chairman, there is another question I would like to propound
in connection with the procedure that brings this bill before” the
House again after having once been defeated. Does it infer that those
Members who defeated this issue about 10 days ago” and have since
changed their views did not know what the bill was all about? If they
change their vote at this time, are they confessing that they made a
mistake ?2° .

S1-:z WHO? (Concluded)

Not through government handouts-——which would only pile up
more debt and higher and higher taxes. But by using our productive
capacity1 to give Americans more for their money in the things they
buy, so they can buy'more—and thus create more jobs and _more earn-
ings for all.

In short,2 by making full use of this country’s limitless energy and
ambition, we can help lead the world into a11 era of peace and plenty?’
greater than any yet seen.

Business is pledged to do its part——ﬁrst, by increasing the oppor-

52 ‘ , [2S’s

tunities for all to earn, and, second, by4 increasing the opportunities
for all to buy.

To increase the opportunities for all to earn, business pledges a just
and enlightened5 economic policy, and the opening of every possible
avenue of advancement for the worker.

It proposes to“ proceed at the earliest possible time with the starting

of new ventures and the expansion of old in order to provide more

jobs for7 more people. _

It proposes to put into workers’ hands the most eﬂicient tools obtain-
able——so that a worker, by increasing hiss production, may add still
further to his earnings. _

To increase the opportunities for all to buy, business proposes to
make full use of the9 technological knowledge it has gained during
the war to put on the market the finest products that can be made,
at the lowest prices” for which they can be sold.

It proposes to seek, through unending study and research in the
ﬁelds of production and distribution, every“ possible means for lower-
ing prices still further over the years, so that more of the good things

40. High-Speed Take No. 8—Taxation

Mr. Chairman, my understanding is that the only tax they pay is
the tax upon real.estate and ﬁxtures. I know that in my own1 State,
under our system of taxation, the law provides for an income tax but
not for a tax on intangible property. We tax only2 tangible property.
All intangible property, under the laws of my State, is exempt from
taxation; and the income tax is?’ substituted in lieu of that source of
taxation. So, in my State, under our present law, the only property of
branch banks subject to‘ tax under this bill would be their real estate

253] 53

and ﬁxtures. That perhaps is true in other States having an income
tax, and it is true in5 every State where intangible property is taxed.

There is another objection which has received no discussion except
the assertion“ by the Senator from Virginia in the debate the other day
that, if the branch-banking system were authorized, the result would7
be that the States would authorize branch banking for the State banks.
That would put the State banks on a parity with the banks operated
under8 the National Government. But let me call attention to this
very pertinent fact, which the Senator did not discuss; namely, that
under9 this bill the parent bank may establish a branch bank outside
the boundaries of the State in which the parent bank is located.

I want” to suggest and seriously call to the attention of the Senate
the fact that this is just another step to the ﬁnal end, that branch”
banking will be permitted in this country, without respect to any
territorial area whatever. Assuming, however,” that that may not
occur, under this bill a parent bank may establish branch banks outside
of the State where the parent bank is located. It” is well known to

every lawyer that a State cannot authorize its banking institutions

to do business beyond its own boundaries.” In other words, there is
no State in the Union that can authorize a banking institution organ-
ized under its laws to go into15 another State and there engage in the
banking business. It has no control over banking institutions in other
States. If a bank in” any State has connections with a bank in another
State, the States where the respective banks. are located have exclu-
sive jurisdiction” in each case. Therefore, it is impossible under our
fundamental law to place the States of the Union on a parity with
the” Federal Government in connection with branch banking. I think
that is a serious objection to the establishment of branch banking, as
proposed” by this bill.

I have brought out these two situations. I think the objections are
valid. I have examined this problem carefully?“

DoN’T DIE ON THIRD

It ‘was quite a long time ago, when the Detroit Tigers were play-
ing the team from Cleveland. The score was tied. It was the last

54 [25’s

half of the ninth, and1 two men were out. The fate of the game rested
with Moriarty, the white-bloused ﬁgure that shuttled back and forth
at third base. As the (.lCCiSiVC2 moment approached, all the players
stood up at their benches; and 18,000 spectators bent forward in tense
expectancy. Moriarty3 was on third.

M He had come there in the ordinary‘ way. He had singled, the next
batter had sacriﬁced him to second, and then a “long ﬂy”4 had ad—
vanced him to third. There he stood, alert in every nerve.

Much as it meant to have advanced that far, third—base runs are
not marked up on the5 scoreboard. Third base is not a destination-
it is the last stop on the road “home.” The world is full of third
bases. To leave school, to earn your college6 degree, to enter a profes—
sion, is only to start toward third base. To get the job you want, even
to become the head of your business,7
Third base is opportunity, and opportunity is not arrival, it is only
another ‘point of8 departure. Attain the White House itself, and you
have only got as far as third base. The test of all you have is yet to
come. No time for9 self-applause at third—many a promising run has

died there.

And there stood Moriarty. If he failed, the team failed with him.
Concentrated on him” at that moment were the hopes and fears of
thousands who seemed to hold their breath, and so still was the great
park that even the breeze seemed to forget to“ blow.

One way to get oﬂ? third is to wait for someone to get a hit. An-
other is to get away on your own initiative—M0riarty12 chose that.
He knew his game. He knew the catcher’s signals called for a ball

45. High-Speed Take No. 9—Taxation

Mr. Speaker, I am informed that the bill has been unanimously re-
ported from the Judiciary Committee and unanimously‘ reported by
the Rules Committee to the House.

The practical position in which the ordinary Government employee
ﬁnds2 herself is this: The ordinary employee enters the Government
service at a small salary. She comes from a State where there is a3
State income tax. She considers the State she has left as her home.

She ﬁnds herself a room in the District of Columbia. She may be
sent‘ to work in the State of Virginia, for instance, or in one of the
Government establis/zments in Maryland, or in some other location.5

After a short time she receives a notice to pay the District of Colum-
bia income tax. Then she receives notice to pay income“ taxes in either
the State of Virginia or the State of Maryland. She also receives
notice to pay her income taxes from7 the State of her domicile. She
pays her home State tax. She disputes the tax of the District of Colum-
bia; it is a small tax, maybes $25, maybe ‘$50. She cannot afford to liti-
gate. The same is true of the State of Virginia or Marylandf’ Conse-
quently she may be compelled to pay three different State income
taxes. She cannot afford to litigate the matter.

Let me call” your attention to one further step in the matter of
income tax, which is the situation that has developed in Philadel-
phia.“ In 1939, Philadelphia passed an ordinance to add a compensa-
tion tax to any person who works in Philadelphia” whether he is a
resident or not. There are literally thousands of people from the
States of New Jersey and Delaware who travel” back and forth be-
tween their State and Philadelphia to work. Their tax is imposed

56 [25’s

upon them, although they have no use or beneﬁt of” the facilities of
that city.

Now, it is perfectly right and proper that the Government employee
should pay the income tax in her” home State. It is rather shocking
that she has to pay the District of Columbia’ and the Virginia or
Maryland tax, in one of” the examples I have cited.

The question is a ‘Federal question. Without desiring in any way
to offend anyone’s feelings," the State courts have a tendency to sup-
port their own laws, and they have a tendency to support the taxing
authorities of their own State.”

It is suggested in the report of the Department of Iustiee that there
are many people besides the Federal employees” who occupy the same
unfortunate position. To me that is not a valid answer to the problem
nor an objection to the bill.2°

DoN’T DIE ON THIRD (Concluded) ‘

One opening remained; make “home” between the moment the

pitch was begun past all recall and the moment the ball struck the
catcher’s mitt——make “home”1 in the fraction of time Mullin’s hit or
miss hung in futurity. That would be a contest in speed between a
5-ounce ball delivered with2 all the force of a superb pitching arm and
the 170-pound body of Moriarty! An unequal contest, for the pitched?‘
ball travels only 60 feet while the runner from third must hurl his
body over a distance of 90 feet.

Moriarty is on third.‘ He builds his prospective run as an engineer
builds a bridge across a river, with inﬁnite pains. Now the Cleveland
pitcher is poising himself5 for a throw. Moriarty is crouched like a
tiger ready to spring—Now! There is a white streak across the field!
A cloud of dust at the home6 plate! The umpire stands over it with

be put out, but it need not be by your inaction. If the run must die,
let it die trying. All of us are on bases. Some of us are waiting” for
someone to bat us farther. Suppose he misses! Mullin missed the ball
that day—had Moriarty waited, he would not have scored.

50. High-Speed Take No. 10—Proposed Legislation

Mr. President, I desire to be just as fair about the matter as the
Senator from Nebraska has been. I do not think I can1 give absolute
assurance that this matter will be carried out in a way that would be
satisfactory to all of us. I do feel, however,2 that there is an excellent
chance that it will bring back to Congress such information as might
enable us to act intelligently?‘ on thematter.

I desire to explain that I think nothing at all will be gained in the
presentation of a constitutional4 question here. At the time of the
original enactment of these bills the question of unconstitutional dele-
gation of legislative5 powers by the Congress was not as well under-
stood as it is now. Senators who have investigated the subject will
remember6 that until the past year the question of delegation of powers

had been carried to the Supreme Court a great number of times; I7

58 [2519

have heard students of law say more than 40 times. I am not certain
just how many times that matter has been considered by the Court;
but, until8 last year, never in the whole history of the Nation had the
Court found that an amendment was void upon the ground of uncon-
stitutional” delegation of legislative power. It came nearest to it in the
case which related to the Tariﬁ' Act of 1890,10 where it gave very seri-
ous consideration to the question. At that time it deﬁned the rule;
but, having deﬁned the rule, it” did not hold that the legislation was
unconstitutional. The question never was ﬁnally determined, and the
rule never was ﬁnally” laid down until the Court considered the oil
case last year. At that time the Court unanimously determined that
section 9 of the1‘°’ act was unconstitutional.~ They then again deﬁned
the power and responsibility of Congress in words so very clear that
no” person could reasonably escape the force and effect of that decla-
ration.

Under these opinions by the Supreme Court I submit that” here
is one thing that stands out with remarkable clarity:

Congress cannot delegate legislative powers unless at the «time it
ﬁxes” a standard by which the executive agency is to be guided.

This proposal is utterly unconstitutional. It is" completely in vio-
lation of the rule as laid down for our guidance by the Court, and it
cannot be sustained. I

In view of these considerations” I do not think it wise to give my
support to the proposed legislation. I am utterly indifferent to the
disposition” of the amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.
I hope, however, that a reasonable solution may soon be reached.”

ARGUMENTS ARE COSTLY

Oliver Wendell Holmes once said: “An argument is a device which
puts wise men and fools on the same ground.” In an argument, as in
war,1 everyone loses.

Our eventual success in selling depends on our ability to get along,

well with people. We may not” be salesmen in the professional sense,
yet we all must “sell” good will in whatever work we are doing.

25’s] 59

When we are drawn into arguments?’ we are being led into a trap, ‘

in which, unfortunately, it is easy to become entangled. We all know
the fellow who “never4 lost an argument .and never won a friend.”
He could silence the other fellow by argument—but did he ever cause
him to change his mz'na’?5 In the heat of an argument reason usually
ﬂies out of the window. Both parties get stubborn. The situation
often take: on“ the ﬂavor suggested in the story of the Arab whose
neighbor asked to borrow his rope. V

“I cannot lend it,” said the Arab. “I need it7 to tie up my goat milk.”

“What nonsense,” retorted the neighbor. “That is no reason. One
does not tie up milk with a rope.”

“Brother,” said the Arab,8 “when one does not Want to do a thing,
one reason is as good as another.”

The story illustrates why people may fail in their objective,9 even
when winning arguments. Superior arguments may ridicule the rea-
soning of another person, display his lack of knowledge,” cause him
embarrassment—but they also build up his resentment. V The person

vanquished in an argument subconsciously says to himself:11 “So you_

think you can make me look foolish? Well, I’ll show you that you
can’t have your way in everything.” One of the most valuable lessons”
we can learn is that we can’t argue good will into anyone.

People are attracted for other rea.von5—because someone pays them
a sincere” compliment or goes out of the way to please them. When
we argue, we simply advertise to the other fellow that we value our”
opinions more highly than we do his. Consequently, we lose his con-
ﬁdence, co-operation, and good will.

There is no need to be a door mat,” however. We have every
right to voice our own views, but it can be done in a dignified way
which gives no oﬁ’ense.

We can estimate” in our own mind: Why the other person wants
to argue. Perhaps he’s just in a talkative mood. All right—let him
talk. It won’t hurt us to” listen, for we learn by listening. More
important, it makes him feel good to have an appreciative audience.
He wants to impress us. A1118 right——be impressed. It pleases him to
think that we value his ideas. He will respect us because we display
self—control.—Confederation Life (472 standard words)

53. High-Speed Take No. 11—Reviewp

(This take reviews all the shortcuts introduced in Assignments 1-10.) _

Mr. Speaker, I understand that the Department of Agriculture and
the Treasury Department object to the amendments offered1 by the
gentleman from New York to the pending legislation, amendments
designed to provide economic relief to those communities2 that depend
for their prosperity mainly on agriculture.

It seems to me that the Department of Agriculture and the Treas-
ury3 Department could have sent their economic experts before the
House Committee on Agriculture when those amendments were
brought up and4 could have had them explain then the reasons why
these departments were against the amendments and why they con-
sidered them unwise. As the gentleman5 from New Mexico said, we
gave ample notice to those departments that these amendments would

, bebrouglzt up and that hearings would be held in.“ the District of
Columbia for the purpose of providing an opportunity for all inter-
ested departments of the Federal7 Government to be heard. The
Department of Iustice, the Civil Service Commission, and several other
departments of the Nationals Government that had no direct respon-
sibility in the matter were represented by competent employees, who
explained the9 views taken by their departments on the pending legis-
lation. There is no reason why the Department of Agriculture and

' the Treasury“) Department could not have taken similar action if

they wanted to present reasons for stopping the adoption of the
amendments” of the gentleman from New York.

I I might say that these amendments to increase the appropriation
for the purpose of providing economic” relief to agriculture were
debated on the floor of the House. The arguments against the legis-
lation were answered by our13 Democratic leader, the gentleman from
Kentucky, Who has rendered invaluable service to agriculture. Please
bear this fact in” mind—the gentleman from Kentucky fought for
agriculture even after the Supreme Court of the United States declared
unconstitutional” the legislation which the Congress of the United
States had passed a year or two ago to carry out the agricultural” pro-
gram of the President of the United States. In other words, we may
take it for granted that if the pending legislation has the” support of
the gentleman from Kentucky, who has established such a ﬁne reputa-
tion as a friend of agriculture, the legislation” will help agriculture.

I think that it is the responsibility of the Congress of the United
States to pass this legislation,” with the amendments of the gentleman
from New York; and I am confident that we willtake favorable action
on it. -

I notice2° that the Senate is also taking up the case of agriculture,
and Senators on the Democratic side will soon bring some practical“
legislation to the ﬂoor of the Senate. The Senate Committee on Agri-
culture is engaging the services of a staﬁ" of civil” service employees to
deal with this subject. A special appropriation to take care of the com-
pensation of these civil service23 employees will be asked for as soon as
possible. When the House and Senate conclude their deliberations, I
have reason to believe that“ we shall have legislation of a high stand-
ard.

One fact is certain—the economic picture looks much brighter for
agriculture.

Mr.25 Speaker, while I still have the ﬂoor, I wish to express my
thanks for the excellent service rendered by the staff of the committee.
Without that” service, the committee would never have been able to
produce a bill so quickly. These employees carried out their responsi-
bilities27 faithfully and took a deep interest in the work they were

62 [25’s

doing. It seems to me that these employees, as well as a great many
other28 civil service employees of the Government of the United States,
deserve an increase in salary. I am informed by the gentleman” from
Louisiana that civil service employees in the District of Columbia have
not received an increase since the civil3° service salary schedules were
established in 1942. It seems to me it is our responsibility to see31 that
these employees are adequately compensated. I hereby serve notice on
the Congress of the United States and the people of” the United States
that I shall bring up legislation in the interest of these employees in
the near future.

The gentleman from33 California reminded me that the Treasury
of the United States is against an increase atithe present time. It has
given‘ notice“ that an additional appropriation by the Congress of the
United States for the purpose of increasing the rate of compensation35
for civil service employees would not be wise. The Treasury maintains
that the Congress of the United States will have to assume“ complete
responsibility for the effects of such an increase on the economy of the
country. Mr. Speaker, was there ever?” a time that ‘the Congress of
the United States has not taken complete responsibility for any appro-
priations it has voted?‘°’8 I want to inform the people of the United
States that, if the Congress of the United States decides to increase the
salaries39 of civil service employees, it will assume complete responsi-
bility for the effects of that action on our national economy.” (1,000

Mr. Chairman, during the last two days we have been discussing
and commenting upon the War Department appropriation bill for the
ﬁscal year. We have heard many‘ interesting comments upon the bill;
and, before we commence to read it, I wish to add a few remarks as to
my position on the measure.

In the first place,2 may I make it clear that the bill represents a
unanimous agreement on the part of the subcommittee. In some in-
stances, of course, there are features in the bill3 which we individually
wish might have been changed and do not agree to entirely; but the
bill represents a compromise which I believe is satisfactory"‘ and will
permit our War Department to function in the manner desired.

At the outset I wish to compliment the very eﬂicient and able
chairman of our5 subcommittee on the manner in which he has pre-
pared the bill and on the energy which he has given to it in our vari-
ous hearings. With his energy, and with“ the assistance of the able
clerk of the committee, we have a measure which we recommend to
the House for its favorable consideration.

While I am mentioning7 the chairman, who has worked untiringly
on the measure since the middle of December, I also wish to compli-
ment the members of that committee on theirs activities in connection
with War Department matters. In the hearings you will ﬁnd a report
of a trip of inspection which the subcommittee made last9 fall. They
traveled through and inspected many of our military establishments;
and I think the interest which has been manifested by these Members
in the hearings“) is an indication of the value of their study. As a mat-
ter of fact, I was not able to make that trip, and I regret it; but I think
the value which“ has been obtained from that trip is something of
immediate good to the public.

I make especial mention of that feature of the bill because of the
fact that the public” is all too apt to consider any appropriation for
the War Department as an appropriation for national defense. In this
instance we have at13 least one—third of the bill which is essentially

64 [303

nonmilitary in character and has nothing to do with the purposes of
our military establis/zments.” However, I do want to comment on
these nonmilitary activities brieﬂy. I intend to conﬁne my remarks
pretty much to the military part of the” bill. In the nonmilitary activi-
ties, for which $168 million have been appropriated, we ﬁnd a rather

unusual situation” this year—we ﬁnd a very large increase in the

appropriation. During the past two‘ or three years the appropriation:
for these purposes have been supplied" almost entirely from other
funds. This year $100 million will be made available for improvements.
on rivers and harbors by the Director of the Budget.” It is that thought
that I wish to convey to the Member: of the House; namely, that that
vast sum has nothing to do with our military activities.

At this point, I19 wish to compliment the War Department for the
splendid job it has done in making our Army the finest in the world.
We now have an Army of which We may be proud.”

WE PROVE THEM INNOCENT

In a lonely shack in Alaska, an old prospector lay dead—murdered
by a bullet through his head. The still-falling snow had obliterated
all tracks around the cabin;1 but it didn’t take investigating oﬂicers
long to ﬁnd the obvious suspect near by: a rival prospector, long-time

enemy of the victim. The fact2 that the suspect was also an ex—criminal

added nothing to the evidence against him, of course; but that seemed
hardly necessary.

First, the ofﬁcers found the?’ bullet that killed the murdered man.
It had lodged in the window sill of the cabin. And when they came

‘upon the suspect, he possessed a rifle of the same caliber as‘ that which

had ﬁred the fatal bullet. The riﬂe had recently been ﬁred. And the
man’s socks were covered with blood. ‘

He denied his guilt, of course, as murderers usually5 do. He
admitted he had ﬁred the rifle, but insisted he had shot at a reindeer.
That was how he got the blood on his socks, he said. But he couldn’t
produce the reindeer.6 It seemed to have vanished into thin air. An
ofﬁcer summed it all up grimly: “That old fellow is as good as hanged
right now.”

30’s] H 65

Scrupulously, however, the oHicers7 gave him the beneﬁt of the
doubt—little as the doubt was in their minds. They pae/(eel up the
riﬂe, bullet, and socks, and started them to the nearest city by dogsled.8
There a plane picked them up and carried them all the way down and
across the continent to Washington, D. C., where they were ﬁnally
delivered to our men. . »

A scientist9 made exhaustive tests of the bloodstained socks, while
experts tested the riﬂe and checked the bullet--and the tests proved
conclusively that the bloodstains were made by reindeer blood1° and
that the murder bullet could not possibly have been ﬁred by the sus-
pect’s riﬂe.

In due time, other similar tests pinned the crime on a different’

suspect. But the“ point I want to make here is that an innocent man,
who might well have been found guilty by a jury, was exonerated.
With only the details differing, this happens” all the time. That
is the American way of law enforcement. (372 standard words) (Con-

63. High-Speed Take No. 13—Appropriations

Mr. Speaker, few of our constituents realize the vast amount of
work that it is necessary for a Member of Congress to perform which
is in no waryl reﬂected in our districts. We are expected by some to
have a personal knowledge of all pending legislation. If those who
expect this of us, however, stopped2 to realize that this Congress, when
it adjourns in a few weeks, will have considered 20,000 bills and other
measures since Ianuary, they would better understand3 the situation
that confronts us. /

Cur tasks are diversiﬁed. Because the hour of meeting is twelve
noon, many feel that a Congressman’s life is a round of pleasure.4 If
those people would be at our oﬁice early in the morning and see the
dozens of letters that come to our desk, then watch us run to a com-

mittee meeting or around“ to various Government departments scat-
tered over a great city, they would have a more intelligent ‘understand-
ing of what their Representatives do.

The“ standing committees of the House, where all legislation and
matters that affect the conduct of the Government are considered, are
the places where all well-informed people_7 know that a vast amount
of work is done. Take as an example the hearings on the deﬁciency

- bill. That bill contained about two billion dollars in appropriations8

for various Government agencies. Several thousand pages of testimony
are found in the hearings. A complete analysis of the activities9 of
this organization is found in one volume, How many of our citizens
know that members of the committee sat for months, while the gentle-
man from Texas and” his 38 associates obtained information relative
to expenditures in the past and made Government oﬂicials justify their
request for additional“ money. When the statement is made, “the
amount is below the Budget estimate,” it means that the oﬁ’-icial could
not justify the demand for the full amount.” In that hearing you will
even ﬁnd pages of testimony regarding expenditures for telephone,
telegraph, automobiles, and typewriters, to say nothing” of the more
important activities. Everything, however, is covered.

It was at night that the members of the committee were required

' to remain in their offices“ looking after the mail from their constit-

.Z£€72t.$'.

It so happens that the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive

Departments is charged with certain” duties; and, as chairman of the
committee, I feel that it is only proper that some attention be given to
claims bills. It is not a pleasant una’ertal(ing for one” to disagree with

_one’s colleagues on private bills. The Government departments nat-

urally watch the action of Congress in handling claims growing out of
Government contracts."

My contention has been that Congress should give more than ordi-
nary attention to the principle involvea’ in some of these claims, no
matter how small the amount. Onels Member has gone so far as to say
that I have no sympathy for the disabled servicemen because I opposed
a bill providing for the payment of insurance“) in a veteran’s case. The
principle involvea’ was whether Congress desired to adopt a policy of
overruling a decision of the Veterans’ Bureau.”

IWE PROVE THEM INNOCENT (Concluded)

When people are guilty of offenses against society, we prove them
guilty, if we can. But for every one proved guilty, we prove many
more innocent.

On1 the night of December 27, 1936, ten-year—old Charles Fletcher
Mattson was kidnaped from his home in Tacoma, Washington. Dc-
mands were made2 for $28,000 in ransom, but all efforts to effect his

’ return failed; and almost a month later, his dead body was found.

Since that December night, the3 F.B.I. has investigated more than
twenty thousand suspects. in the attempt to bring the guilty ones to
justice. It is one of the two kidnap cases on the“ books of the F.B.I.
which have not yet been solved. Naturally, jealous as we are of our
record, we should like few things. more than to see the case solved and
closed. Yet when people5 have actually confessed to the crime—as they
have——we have proved them innocent—and deprived ourselves of the
satisfaction of closing the case.

I am not boasting“ about the F .B.I. when I say this. I am boasting
about the country under whose rules the F .B.I. operates. I know very
Well that the F.B.I. would not7 last long—-or, at least, its director
wouldn’t—-—if it began to operate with the methods of the police of
some other countries that are more concerned with putting peoples

. in jail, or of disposing of them by more drastic methods, than with

cstablis/zz'ng the fact: by which not only are the wicked punished but
the innocent protected.” ~

Some time after the kidnaping of the Lindbergh child, a man
signed a confession admitting that he commzftea’ the crime. Our inves-
tigation showed that a little group,” led by a small-town police oﬂicial,
had been so overanxious to solve the case and get a conviction that they
had kidnaped their suspect, held him captive in a cellar,“ tortured
him, and finally shut him in .an institution for feeI7le—mz'ndca’, in order
to get him to sign the confession. This ﬂagrant attempt to railroad
an” innocent man to the electric chair not only failed but the per-
petrators were themselves arrested and convicted. This country won’t
stand for that kind of police work.”

68 [303

Personally, I cannot understand why any police oﬂicial would want ‘

to operate that way. Any reader of detective stories knows that one
great satisfaction” in solving a mystery is the clearingfrom suspicion
of innocent people. It is as true in real life as in fiction.

Not long ago, an airplane” factoryon the east coast reported find-
ing fragments of glass in the hydraulic systems. of a number of planes
just before the ﬁnal tests. Automatically,” everybody working on the
planes who might have placed the foreign material in the systems was
under suspicion of sabotage. It was, for me, a moment" of supreme
satisfaction when I could report, on the basis of an exhaustive investi-
gation, that the whole aﬁfair was an industrial accident and that“;
none of those American workers had betrayed his country.

Modern science has developed many new aids for the investigation
of crime. Yet, even more than aids” in ﬁnding the criminal, they are
aids in ﬁnding who is not the criminal. If you have the ﬁngerprints
of a person who committed a crime, nobody else’s2° ﬁngerprints will
match them. Scientiﬁc tests prove what the facts are, not what some-
body’s theory is. And while theories may be dangerous to innocent
persons, enough farts” can always save them. I am glad I live in a
country where that is the chief aim of the law.——]. Edgar Hoover (646

68. High-Speed Take No. 14—Education

Mr. Speaker, I am delighted that the bill bearing my name, calling
for an appropriation of $50,000 to advance a program of national1
safety and accident prevention, passed the House of Representatives
on June 1. I

For many, many months I have been deeply interested in the acci—
dent situation2 in this country, particularly from the standpoint of
highway safety. In this Congress I introduced another measure author-
izing the Seeretary of3 A grieulture to investigate and report on traffic

303] . - 69

conditions, with recommendations for corrective legislation. I hope
that this bill will also pass.

The4 man in the street in the United States is becoming more and
more accident conscious. Accidents, their causes and possible remedies,

have become a topic5 of serious conversation. The newspapers, radio

systems, local and national organizations, all have come to show great
interest in the movement.

The6 bill whichpassed the House today provides an appropriation
of $50,000 to meet current costs, mostly of a clerical nature, of the
Accident7 Prevention Conference, a group of patriotic citizens who are
volunteering their time in behalf of accident prevention. This group
was formed as a consequence of8 the conference called together by the
President of the United States to consider ways and means of making
life safer on land and sea and in the air. The9 conference was headed
by our able and eﬂicient Secretary of Commerce.

It was not the intention of the conference to attempt to set up
another large” Government department to combat the accident prob-
lem. Committees of patriotic men and women were formed as a
clearinghouse for accidenbprevention” ideas. Their time was given
without remuneration, and committees were formed to study various
types of accidents. These committees and subcommittees are even”
now carrying on the work; but they have been handicapped because
of lack of funds for clerical help, printing, and so forth.

The conference agreed that it should not seek” to displace any of
the activities of existing safety bodies but rather augment and en-
courage their activities.

The committees are seeking to meet” immediate problems with
educational material. Accident-prevention methods which have been
used successfully are being emphasized rather than resorting” to pro-
longed research and thus delay much—needed results.

Safety studies are being introduced in the schools of the country
on a broad scale, and the importance” of safety as a part of the cur—
riculum of all schools is being emphasized. In some parts of the coun—
try wonderful progress has been made in school teaching of safety.”
The young mind has proved to be more receptive to safety teaching
than that of the adult. I hope, therefore, that the efforts of the con-

70 0 , [30’s

ference to have safety education,” dealing with all types of accidents,
meet with success.

The high point in the conference program which appeals to me is

A the attempt to obtain uniform vehicle” regulations throughout the

United States. During the past year I have spoken many times on the
floor of the Home of the serious importance of such uniformity.”

FULToN’s IDEA

Robert Fulton is commonly credited with having invented the
steamboat. Actually, he did not invent it. The steamboat had been
launched and used before Fultonl ever trod the deck of one. The
modern world now places a man named Iohn Fitch first among Ameri-
can inventors and experimenters with the steamboat, for historians?
say he made a screw—propelled craft that worked in 1796. Neverthe—
less, Robert Fulton’s achievement was just as great and as important
as?’ if he had been the inventor. Of what use is an idea if it is allowed
to die? » r ' T‘

Heedless eyes saw the steamboat and paid no attention to it. It
took Robert“ Fulton to recognize its value and proﬁt—making possi-
bilities. With splendid enterprise and courage and fortitude, he

launched the steamboat and a fortune—making5 business simultane-'

ously.

Fulton’s steamboat was duly launched and started on its first New
York—to-Albany trip on August 17, 1807. The“ success of that historic
trip marked a new era in American transportation. Soon scores of

. imitators and shrewd businessmen in all parts of the world followed7

his example. Fulton possessed not only the vision and creative genius
to bring a new'industry into existence, but also the practical ability8
of the careful, common—sense businessman. Fulton was that great
rarity, the creative genius with his head in the clouds but his feet on
the ground. _

F ulton’s father died” when the great inventor was only three years
old, and the family moved from their poverty—stricken farm to Lan—
caster, Pennsylvania. As a boy, Fulton liked to” sketch, paint, and

303] 71


(tinker with anything mechanical, but was a laggard at his school

lessons.

Forced by his family’s situation to become self-supporting at seven— ‘

teen,“ Robert Fulton went to Philadelphia to earn £1 living at paint-
ing. He worked hard and earned enough to support himself and also
send money to his mother,” brothers, and sisters. There, as in Europe
later, he grew in tact and poise and made many friends in important
places. But his hard work broke down his health. He went abroad
1:013 study art and enjoy a holiday. '

While traveling in Devonshire, he became acquainted with the
Duke of Bridgewater and the Earl of Stanhope. Both noblemen took”
an interest in the young artist, particularly because of his cleverness
with the lathe as well as the easel. They were canal engineers and
inventors and“ the vast estate of the Duke of Bridgewater abounded
in coal, together with other mineral deposits. The Duke was building
a system of canals to transport” these minerals cheaply, and the Earl
of Stanhope told Fulton he meant to equip a boat with a steam engine.

Undoubtedly, F ulton’s association with these men had" much to do
with his dropping art for the hazards of an inventor’s life. He became
enthusiastic over the problems of water transportation. Said he, “I
contemplate“ a time when canals shall pass through every vale, wind-
ing around each hill, and bind the whole country together.”

F ulton’s prophetic vision was sound, but national” uniﬁcation came
through railroads rather than through canals.‘ Fulton had lived abroad
for several years and had, while in Paris, discussed steamboat projects
with Chancellor” Livingston, then Minister of the United States.
Livingston had built steamboats before, but of disappointing speed.
The discouraged Fitch had turned over his patent drawings“ to the
American Consul on leaving France at the outbreak of the French
Revolution, and the New York Legislature offered Livingston the
exclusive right of22 the Hudson River for steam navigation if he could
accomplish a successful voyage on that river. Livingston and Fulton
became partners.

F ulton. is quoted23 as having said, “When I was building my first

steamboat, the project was viewed by the public either with indiffer—

ence or with contempt as a visionary scheme. The Clermont“ was a

72 [30’s

success from the day of its launching.” (729 standard words) (Con-

73. High-Speed Take No. 15—Tariff

Mr. President, I desire to ask a question of the Senator from Maine
who is oﬂering this resolution. As I understand it, the resolutionl has
for its objective the protection of industries of the United States against
the advantages which are supposed to be given to foreign nations now2
operating on a cheap—currency basis. The question which presents
itself to me is this: How can we remedy that situation by tariff legis-
lation? How?’ can we accommodate the tariff schedules to the changes
which may take place in those countries with reference to the currency
they are using?

We estahlish a4 certain tariff rate, which is supposed to be in har-
mony with the situation as we see it now. But a week from today or
a month from today the currency5 basis is entirely changed, with the

result that. we may be at the same disadvantage as we were before the

rates were increasea’. In fact, we may be at a greater“ disadvantage.

I am in entire accord with What the Senator seeks to accomplish;
that is, to protect our industries against the effect of the cheap curren-
cies7 in foreign countries. I do not see, though, how it is possible to do
that except by arranging a stabilization of the currency itself through a

~treaty8 between nations. If he could point out a method of accom-

plishing it through the tariff, I certainly would want to accomplish it
in that way. I readily concede” the advantages. which accumulate to
the country using cheap currency. I cannot agree with those who
insist that the advantage is of little consequence.” However, I do not
believe we can meet the situation through tariﬁ‘ legislation.

I do not know to what extent they have adopted this practice in
other countries.“ Whether or not they have adopted it, however, I

do not see how it is possible to work effectively in this manner to-

303] ‘ 73

accomplish what we desire to” accomplish. A month from now the
currency‘ situation may be so changed that the tariff rates will be no
more effective for our protection than they were before we13 increased
them. Only last week Great Britain increased her exchange fund, the
purpose of which was to enable Great Britain to hold the pound down,
if necessary, and to increase” the price of the dollar, if necessary. They
will thus be able to take advantage of the situation which we are trying
to cureby a tariff.

I know” that at the present moment most of the countries com-
peting with us have adopted this method of protecting themselves
against depreciated currencies. But this” does not mean that we must
follow their lead. I am glad to know that the Senator agrees with me
that the stabilization of the money of the world is the best cure for

the" condition which we desire to correct. I know, too, that there are .

a great many countries ‘using the method suggested by the Senator
from West Virginia. It” is a well—known fact that only this week one
of the South American countries put into effect a special tariff against
us. But that does not change the contention” which I_made that we
cannot cure the condition by a tariff.

I am glad to note that the Senator realizes that the resolution of-
fered is temporary.”

FULTo»N’s IDEA (Concluded)

Fulton was well aware of the riches to be reaped with steamboats
and wrote a friend, “My steamboat voyage to Albany and back turned
out more favorably than I had1 calculated. The distance from New
York to Albany is 150 miles. I ran it up in 32 hours and down in 30.
I had a light breeze against me2 the whole way, both going and com-
ing, and the voyage had been performed wholly by the power of the
steam engine.  overtook many sloops and schooners and parted with3
them as if they had been at anchor.

“The power of propelling boats by steam is now fully proved. The
morning I left New York, there were about 30 persons in the city‘
who believed that the boat would ever move one mile an hour or be

74 [30’s

of the least utility; and while we were putting off from the wharf,
which was crowded with spectators,5 I heard a number of sarcastic
remarks.

“Having employed much time, money, and zeal in accomplishing
this work, it gives me great pleasure to see it fully answer my6 expec-
tations. It will give a cheap and quick conveyance to the merchandise
on the Mississippi, the Missouri, and other great rivers which are now
laying open7 their treasures to the enterprise of our countrymen, and
although the prospect of personal emolument has been some induce-
ment to me, yet I feel infinitely8 more pleasure in reflecting on the
immense advantage that my country will derive from the invention.”

Fulton was building the first steam warship for the Government
when9 he died in 1815. Before his death, he had built seventeen boats,
including the ﬁrst torpedo boat and the first steam ferryboats. Fulton
was the first man” who had suﬂicient vision, courage, and patience to
make the steamboat a commercial success.—Nz'c/zols Field Wilson (316
standard words) I

AN EMPLOYEE SPEAKS

‘p‘I have something to give to our company which it doesn’t seem to
want. The management is somewhere way up in the clouds, and I
have no contact with it. At first I tried1 making suggestions, but soon
learned to keep my mouth shut and do as I was told. The few salary
increases I’ve got I’ve had to beg for. But, more than money, I want2
recognition, freedom, and a sense of being really in on the company’s
aﬂairs. The aloofness of the /rig/zer—up5 makes a lot of us younger men
fall into a3 ‘don’t care’ attitude. I think it does the firm more harm
than a sit-down strike.”

Thus we quote from an employee who resents being “kept in his
place.” He lzas_ told an investigator“ all about it, airing his views upon
the shortcomings of business management. He wants us to realize that
a wise management might readily enlist hearts5 as well as heads; that
there are rich reserves of energy, enthusiasm, initiative, and originality
ready to be tapped if only businessmen“ would be wise enough to har—
ness them. He suggests that employers too often show a reluctance to
step down, strangely content to use half of their employees’ intelli-
gence7 when they might use the whole.

78. High-Speed Take‘ No. 16-—Agricu1ture

Mr. President, I should now like to be recognized again. I realize
that I have lost the ﬂoor twice by yielding to questions, but I invite the
attention of Sencztorsl to the fact that that seems to have been the cus-
tom this afternoon. I hope that, under the circumstances, no one will
invoke the rule to take me off the ﬂoor, which, I2 admit, could be done,
because I have already spoken twice on this emergency when I had
intended to speak only once. If I may get back to where I was when
I,was3 interrupted and continue the chain of my thought, I shall en-
deavor to do so. '

As I said at the beginning, the argument is not all on one side; but
when it4 develops from the evidence, as it has in this case, that direct
buying takes competition away from. the public market, which has a
tendency to increase the5 price, I do not care what someone else says.
If I say two and two equal four and somebody else says that they
equal ﬁve, he may be persistent in his view; but still I6 believe two and
two equal four.

When we take competition away from a public market, no matter
how great the man may be who says that this does not affect the price,7
I cannot believe it. I may have respect for his judgment, but I am

76 [303

unable to understand how we can reduce competition at a public mar-
ket withouts depressing prices and wages. _ .
I readily admit that the man who ships direct sometimes gets a

’ temporary advantage. The public markets have to be supported? If
“I ship to the public markets, there are certain charges that must be paid

to maintain the public market. If I ship direct, I avoid that expense.
I can see“) how a whole system may get an advantage for the time
being out of direct shipping, but a continuance of it strikes. down the
fundamental structure that would afford“ a price sufﬁcient to com-
pensate the stockman for his troubles. In other words, he is undermin-
ing the business. I do not mean he has no right to do it. I am” not
complaining. However, if he keeps on doing that, eventually he will
have stricken down his public market; and the farmer who produces
stock will sufI'er.1‘°‘

It is very much like the cooperative organizations in certain com-
mz/znz'tz'es. If we could get all the producers of certain articles together”
and have them operate collectively, which could be done at one time
before we had some of the regulations we now have, the result would
be the same. Farmers would form” milk associations or butter asso-
ciations or other kinds of associations to take the products of the mem-
bers and ship them collectively.

In t/zem ease of creamery organizations, as I remember very well,
the private parties interested would come into a community and tem—
porarily" pay a price larger than the cooperative organization could
afford to pay. Thus the cooperatives would be broken down. Perhaps
money was lost in” paying the higher prices, but it was only tempo-
rary and was done to drive the cooperative out of business. Prices were
raised and losses recovered. It seems” to me this is a similar situation,
and it is quite natural that commission men favor it. I maintain, how-
ever, that it is not fair to the farmers.”

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT -
(The President’s war message delivered December 8, 1941.)

Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Senate and the
H oase of Representatiz/es:

30’s] 77

Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date1 which will live in infamy-
the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked
by naval and air forces of the empire of Japan.2

The United States was at peace with that nation, and, at the solici-
tation of Japan, was still in conversation with its government and its
Emperor looking3 toward the maintenance of peace in the Paciﬁc.

Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons. had commenced
bombing in the American island of Oahu4 the Japanese Ambassador to
the United States and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State
a formal reply to a recent American5 message. And, while this reply
stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic nego—
tiations, it contained no threat of war or of armed attack.“

It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes
it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even
weeks ago.7 During the intervening time the Japanese Government
has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements
and expressions of hope for8 continued peace.

The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands has caused severe
damage to American naval and military forces. I regret to tell9 you
that very many American lives have been lost. In addition, American
ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San
Francisco and“) Honolulu.

Yesterday the Japanese Government also launched an attack against
Malaya. ~

Last night Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong.

Last night Japanese forces” attacked Guam.

Last night Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands.

Last night the Japanese attacked Wake Island.

And this morning the Japanese attacked Midway” Island.

Japan has therefore ana’ertal(en a surprise offensive extending
throughout the Paciﬁc area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for
themselves.” The people of the United States have already formed
their opinions and will understand the implications. to the very life
and safety of our nation.

As Commander“ in Chief of the Army and Navy I have directed
that all measures be taken for our defense.

78 [30’s

Always will we remember the character of the onslaught”
against us.

No matter how long it’may take us to overcome this premeditated
invasion, the people of America, in their righteous might, will win

through to” absolute victory.

I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people
when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the” uttermost
but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never
again endanger us.

Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our” people,
our territory, and our interests are in grave danger. . —

With conﬁdence in our armed forces, with the unbounding deter—

mination of our people, we will” gain the inevitable triumph. So help:

us God. .

I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and

dastardly attack by Iapan on Sunday, December” 7, 1941, a state of
war has existed between the United States and the Japanese Empire.

83. High-Speed Take No. 17—Agricu1ture

Mr. President, I desire to speak brieﬂy on the pending bill. I feel

i that the statement which was submitted by the c/zairman of the com-

mittee, the Senator from1 South Carolina, and read by the Senate clerk
yesterday presents a very fair picture of the bill. I feel also that the very
able discussion by the2 Senator from New Mexico yesterday dealt par-
ticularly well with the matter of soil conservation and soil erosion as
the basis of the bill.

Formerly?’ I felt that there was very grave doubt as to the consti—
tutionality of the Soil Conservation Act; in fact, I felt about the same
doubt concerning soil‘ conservation as the basis for a bill that I felt

30’s] 79

in connection with the regulation and control of agricultural produc-
tion.

I regard farm legislation5 of more importance to the welfare of the
country than anything with which the Congress has to deal. The
prosperity of the farmer is vital to the prosperity6 of the entire country.
In fact, as agriculture lies at the base of our entire economic structure,

the well-being of this industry is essential7 to the economic well-being '

of all the American people. So clear has this become that for many
years the Congress has been striving to enact legislation8 that will

establis/z the farmer in a just relation to other industries in our national

economy.

The enactment of the act was an effort to9 accomplish this pur-
pose. The administration of the act was experimental in some respects
and attended with faults that were not expected, but it has gone am
long way toward accomplishing the desired object. The establishment
of a fair exchange value for agricultural products was attained to a
considerable“ degree. It helped to take care of farm surpluses, and it
stimulated farm organization. That it met with the approval of a great
majority of the farmers” of the country is certain. The decision of the

Supreme Court, ﬁnding the act unconstitutional, has made it necessary,‘

itseems to me, for Congress to13 act to preserve the gains that have
been made.

Since the decision of the Supreme Court, I have received letters
from about 13500 farmers in my State. These letters” are in response
to a request that I made for their opinions and advice. About 85 per
cent of them urge that Congress act in their behalf. About 7515 per
cent of them are in favor of an amendment to the Constitution, if
necessary, to limit the power of the Supreme Gourt or to enlarge the”
power of Congress to permit eﬂective legislation.

There is no question that the farmers are better OE than they were
even a year ago. Surely the Congress" will not let them down now.
I am going to take the liberty of reading a letter that is typical of
hundreds that I received from farmers of my State. This” farmer
observes:

“I feel that this act has been the greatest help that agriculture has
ever received and that, unless something is done to replace it, agricul-
ture will surely19 suffer.” ~

My Fellow Americans: The sudden criminal attacks perpetrated by A

the Japanese in the Paciﬁc provide the climax of a decade of interna-
tional1 immorality.

Powerful and resourceful gangsters have banded together to make
war upon the whole human race. Their challenge has now been ﬂung

.violated the long—standing peace between us. Many American soldiers

and sailors have been3 killed by enemy action. American ships have

CHAPTER I

TEACHING FEATURES OF
EXPERT SHORTHAND SPEED COURSE

Theory Review. The experience of the authors, from the obser-
vation of the writing of hundreds of students in their classes, has been
that, even though students may reach 100 or even 120 words a minute,
their ability to apply the elementary principles of Gregg Shorthand
can proﬁtably be developed further in the acquisition of greater legi-
bility and the elimination of mental confusion. Also, constant review
of the brief forms, special forms, and the analogical word-beginnings
and word-endings is desirable. To provide for this desired improve-
ment, most of the assignments begin with a paragraph of Theory
Review consisting of four parts:

1. A list of words illustrating a major principle of Gregg Shorthand.
Assignment 1, for example, reviews the 565 blend; Assignment 2, the letter x,
and so on.

2. A list of brief—form or special—form derivatives.

3. A list of words illustrating an analogical word-beginning or -ending.

4. A list of phrases illustrating elementary phrasing principles.

The key to these Theory Reviews is given in this Teacher’s Hand-
book.

High-Speed Shortcuts. Shortcuts are a double—edged tool. If
they are learned thoroughly, they become a deﬁnite speed asset. If they
are only half learned, so that they cause even the slightest hesitation

would be much better off to write the shortcuts in full. Up to perhaps
100 words a minute, the use of shortcuts cannot be justified. The

The course that Japan has followed for the past ten years in Asia
has paralleled the course of Hitler and Mussolini in Europe and Africa.
Today it” has become far more than a parallel. It is collaboration-
actual collaboration—so well calculated that all the continents of the
world, and all” the oceans, are now considered by the Axis as one
gigantic battleﬁeld.

In 1931, ten year: ago, Japan invaded Manchukuo—without warn-
ing.“

In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia—-without warning.

In 1938, Hitler occupied Austria—without15 warning.

In 1939, Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia—without warning.

Later in 1939, Hitler invaded Poland——16without warning.

In 1940, Hitler invaded Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, Bel-
gium, and LuXembourg—without warning.

In 1940, Italy” attacked France and later Greece-—without warn-
ing.

And this year, in 1941,‘the Axis powers attacked Yugoslavia and
Greece and they dominated” the Balkans—without warning.

In 1941 also, Hitler invaded Russia——without warning.

And now Iapan has attacked Malaya and Thailand——19and the
United States——without warning.

It is all of one pattern.

We are now in this war. We are all in it——all the way. Every sin-

88. High-Speed Take No. 18—Agriculture

Mr. Chairman, the next provision is that the price of the land shall
not exceed $160 an acre. It occurred to me that there might be locali-
ties‘ in the vicinity of cities or of large markets where the land would

82 » ’ [30’s

be more valuable than that in remoter sections. Of course, that would

be true; but there ought2 to be a limitation even as to that. Where we,

as a government, are undertal(in g to set people up in business, it ought
to be on some sort of rational3 standard, and there should be some sort
of rational limitation. It occurred to me that, for the purpose, a limi-
tation of $160 an acre would not be‘ out of alignment. I do not want
the gate left wide open so that scandal may creep in. We ought to
safeguard the administration all we can against that possibility.5

One or two other standards are ﬁxed. It is provided that no higher
price shall be paid in any one case for land than twice the amount for
which it was assessed“ for taxation purposes last year. That would be-
a protection to the .administrative officers, those who shall be charged
with the purchase of the land. They will be subjected7 to all sorts of
pressure. I should like to ﬁx a limit to the extent to which they can
yield to such pressure. The owners of farms and lands who have
declared them for8 taxation under the laws of their own States have
made the declaration under oath. When they receive twice that
amount of money, it seems to me that that is enough. It would pro-
2/ide9 an essential safeguard.

There is another limitation: that no price shall be paid in excess of
50 per cent over and above the price at which the land1° has sold since
1944. If the land has sold since that time for $100 an acre, this would
mean that the owner could sell it for $150“ an acre. It provides a‘
boundary which would safeguard the administrative office and the
Treasury of the United States against abuse.

There is” another limitation: that, if the property has been mort-
gaged since 1944, then the same limitation shall apply—the purchase

. price shall not exceed” 50 per cent over and above the value of the

mortgage on the land.

I believe these limitations would provide reasonable safeguards,
although the diﬁ'erent14 points are subject to discussion and, for -that
matter, correction. My paramount point is to ﬁx limits which shall
protect the good name of Congress.

I was anxious for the” bill to be recommitted because I had in
mind one or two instances which I thought ought to be investigated

. before we took a ﬁnal vote. The transactions” may be entirely inno-

cent. I refer to a project where 23 thousand acres have been bought
30’s] . 83

by the State, I believe, from two or three owners. My information"
is that the State administrator was at one time in the employ of one
of the landowners from whom some of these purchases were made.
The plan is to erect seven” hundred houses on this land. There is
already a store and post office on it. I believe the average acreage is
about 40 acres. It is cotton” land, suitable for the raising of ﬁne cot-
ton; and that may be one reason for the limitation. V

This legislation will change the economic structure of the South.2°

We must share together the bad news°and the good news, the de-
feats and the victories—the ‘changing fortunes of war.

So far the news has all been bad. We have suffered a serious1 set—
back in Hawaii. Our forces in the Philippines, which include the
brave people" of that commonwealth, are taking punishment, but are
defending themselves2 vigorously. The reports from Guam and Wake
and Midway islands are still confused, but we must be prepared for
the announcement that all these three outposts have been seized.

The casualty3 lists of these first few days will undoubtedly be large.
I deeply feel the anxiety of all families of the men in our armed forces
and the relatives4 of people in cities which have been bombed. I can
only give them my solemn promise that they will get news just as
quickly as possible. ,

This government will put its trust5 in the stamina of the American
people, and will give the facts to the public as soon as two condition-s
have been fulﬁlled: ﬁrst, that the information has been6 deﬁnitely and
oﬂicially conﬁrmed; and, second, that the release of the information
at the time it is received will not prove valuable to the enemy.7

Most earnestly I urge my countrymen to reject all rumors. These
ugly little hints of complete disaster ﬂy thick and fast in wartime. They
have to be examined8 and appraised.

As an example, I can tell you frankly that until further surveys

84 . [30’s

are made, I have not suﬂicient information to state the exact damage
which has9 been done to our naval vessels at Pearl Harbor. Admit-
tedly the damage is serious. But no one can say how serious, until we
know how much of this damage” can be repaired and how quickly
the necessary repairs can be made. . . .

We are going to win the war and we are going to win the peace
that follows.

And in the dark“ hours of this day—and through dark days that
may be yet to come—we shall know that the vast majority of the
members of the human race are on our side. Many of them are”
ﬁghting with us. All of them .are praying for us, for, in representing
our cause, we represent theirs as well—our hope and thC1I‘ hope for

liberty under God. (388 standard words)

TEN POINTS OF WISDOM

Although Lincoln uttered the following thoughts during the Civil
War, they might well apply to present conditions:

You cannot bring about prosperity by discouragingl thrift.

You cannot strengthen the Weak by weakening the strong.

You cannot help small men by tearing down big men.

You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich.

You cannot2 lift the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer.

You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than your in!

COITIC.

You cannot further the brotherhood of man by i_nciting3 class
hatred.

You cannot build character and courage by takin g away a man’s

. initiative and independence.

You cannot help men permanently by‘ doing for them what they
could and should do for themselves.

“Prosperity,” Lincoln also said, “is the fruit of labor; property is
desirable, it is a positive5 good in the world. That some should be
rich shows that others may become rich, and hence is just encourage-
ment to industry and enterprise. I take it that it is best for all‘; to leave
each man free to acquire property as fast as he can. Some will get
wealthy. I don’t believe in a law to prevent a man from getting rich;
it would do more harm7 than good.” (212 standard words)

93. I.-Iigh-Speed Take No. 19—Agriculture

Mr. President, I may say in answer to my friend’s inquiry that the
National Government has been in the land business ever since it was
founded, and if it goes1 into the business of buying land and reselling
land now, it will not be far aﬁeld. The fact of the matter is we own
a tremendous amount of land today known as7 public domain, and if
we-extend our activities in that ﬁeld ‘a little, we shall not be out of
harmony with our past history. I hope the gentleman has?’ not for-
gotten our homestead and entry laws for the sale of land to purchasers.

I would like to yield further, but I must complete my remarks in a
reasonable length4 of time.

courtesy of listening to my remarks, and two other Republican Mem-

American tenancy. I want to go i.nto that report for a few minutes. I
want to remind the House“ that, in my judgment, there are some very
outstanding characteristics of the problem that are signiﬁcant, as this
report prepared and signed by all three members of’ the committee
will show.

I want to remind you that during the 40-year period for which com-
plete census ﬁgures are available the group of owner—operators8 who
were free of mortgage debts steadily declined. As a result, today they
represent less than one third of all the farmers. The number of farms
operated9 by tenants increased» rapidly. Farm mortgages grew by leaps
and bounds from a total of slightly over three billion dollars in 1910

to nine billion dollars“) in 1930. These are ﬁgures which the gentle— V

man from Georgia and I compiled from the United States census
reports.

We ﬁnd that no legislation“ of a basic nature relating to a national

86 [303

land policy has been enacted since the adoption of the homestead law
of 1862. At” that time there was a -total of over one billion acres of
land in the public domain, a major portion of which was suitable for
farm purposes.

So long as13 free farm lands were available to the public, farm
families operating their own homesteads free of debt composed the
major group of the Nation’s farmers.

The farm mortgage“ was a minor feature of the farm structure.
Such tenancy as existed was of a voluntary nature. Years ago, how-
ever, all the desirable farm” lands passed into private ownership and
the homestead law of 1862 has become inoperative. Since that time
farm mortgages and tenant rentals” have occupied places of increasing
importance in the Nation’s economy. The plight of the tenant farmer
and the owner—operator has. created a" serious social problem, differ-
ent from any heretofore confronting our people. The reason for this
rapid decline in the number of owner-operated farms“ free of mort-
gage debt and a corresponding increase in the number of tenant farms
is readily found through an analysis of the income of the Nation’s
farmers.” _

In my judgment, you cannot expect to solve this difﬁcult tenancy
problem unless you couple with it a stable income for the farmer who
is buying theland.2°

(Statement to the House of Commons. upon his appointment as Prime

Minister, May 13, 1940.)

On Friday evening last I received from His Majesty the mission to
form a new administra-tion.

It was the evident will of Parliament that this should be conceived‘
on the broadest possible basis and that it should include all parties.

I have already completed the most important p-art of this task.
A war cabinet of2 five members has been formed.

It was necessary that this should be done in one single day on
account of the extreme urgency and rigor of events. Other key?’ posi-

30’s] , 87

tions were ﬁlled yesterday. I am submitting a, further list to the King
tonight. I hope to complete the appointment of principal Ministers
during tomorrow}

The appointment of other Ministers usually takes a little longer.
I trust when the Parliament meets again this part of my task will be
completed and that5 the administration will be complete in all respects.

I considered it in the public interest to suggest to the Speaker that
the House should be summoned today.“ At the end of today’s pro-
ceedings, the adjournment of the House will be proposed until May 21
with provision for earlier meeting if need be.

I now invite7 the House by a resolution to record its approval of
the steps taken and declare its conﬁdence in the new government. The
resolution :

“That this House8 welcomes the formation of a government repre-
senting the united and inﬂexible resolve of the nation to prosecute the
war with Germany to a9 victorious conclusion.”

To form an administration of this scale and complexity is a serious
undertaking in itself. But we are in the preliminary” phase of one of
the greatest b-attles in history. We are in action at many other points—
in Norway and in Holland—and we have to be prepared in“ the
Mediterranean. The air battle is continuing, and many preparations
have to be made here at home.

In this crisis I think I may be pardoned if” I do not address the
House at any length today, and I hope that any of my friends and
colleagues who are affected by the political reconstruction will make”
all allowances. for any lack of ceremony with which it has. been neces-
sary uo act. ‘ I

I say to this House, as I said to Ministers who have joined this gov-
ernment,“ I have nothing to oﬂer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.
We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have
before us many, many months of struggle” and suffering.

You ask, what is our policy? I say it is to wage war by land, sea,
and air. "War with all our might and with all the strength God has
given us, and to wage war” against a monstrous tyranny never sur-
passed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of ‘human crime. That
is our policy. ‘

You ask, what is our aim? I can answer" in one word. It is vic-

tory. Victory at all costs—victory in spite of all terrors—victory, how-
ever long and hard the road may be, for without victory“ there is. no
survival. Let that be realized. No survival for the Empire, no survival
for all that the Empire has stood for, no survival for the urge, the im-

0 pulse” of the ages, that mankind shall move forward toward this goal.

I take up my task in buoyancy and hope. I feel sure that our cause
will not be suffered to fail among men. 0

and to say, “Come then; let us. go forward together with our united

98. High-Speed Take No. 20—Agricu1ture

Mr. Chairman, I am going to address myself during the next 15
minutes to matters pertaining to this bill.
As a member of the subcommittee that‘ participated in the writing

of the bill, I do feel that I have at least a little understanding of it; ‘

but I feel greatly handicapped in that I do not have2 a more general
knowledge of this unusual piece of legislation.

Our committee began hearings on this bill on January 7. We con-
tinued hearings?’ almost daily until February 25. That is seven long
weeks. The members on the majority and minority sides attended the
committee hearings4 with unusual regularity, and each of us gave the

- best he had to a better understanding of a diﬂicult and complex piece

of legislution.5

Our subcommittee is fortunate in being headed by the gentleman
from Missouri, who is undoubtedly the best parliamentarian in the
House today,6 and who can make a record in an orderly and intelligent
manner. The record that we made in the bill covers almost 2,000
printed pages. I commend it7 to the Members of the House and to the
country at large. It is well arranged. It is carefully and intelligently
indexed. I have had the honor of participating8 in the writing of ﬁve
of these bills during the past ﬁve years; and, in the Appropriations

30’s] A 89

Committee as a whole, I have participated in the writing9 of many
appropriation bills. With no thought of ﬁnding any fault with the

work of any of the other subcommittees, may I say to the Members of

the House“) that we have a record in these pages that is so complete
that any taxpayer interested in this subject of agriculture can easily
ﬁnd the subject” he desires for examination. '

To the clerks of our subcommittee much credit must go, of course,
in the preparation of this record, in the preparation of” the report, and
likewise in the preparation of the bill. They are faithful, industrious,
and intelligent; and, without their help, our committee would not have
been able13 to have given you this record.

Again may I say that, if there is any phase of agriculture in which
you are interested, you can take these hearings and find“ your subject

- matter in the index and then you can ﬁnd the testimony given "in

support.

This year, when the bill was written, we had before us the new
Secretary” of Agriculture. He was before our committee for almost-
two days. He was subjected to a very searching examination and cross-
examination.16 Every view that he might entertain concerning the
great subject of agriculture was questioned in some form_ or other, and
he presented himself and his objectives" in a manner that should con-
vince anyone that the American people have at the head of that great
Department a man whose heart beats in tune with the American”
farmer.

The unusual thing about this Secretary is that he never held public
office in his life until he came to the Department of Agriculture,”
coming there from an Indiana farm. He has never himself engaged
in any other occupation than that of farming. He has been a real
farmer all his life.” i

W1NsToN CHURCHILL
(Extracts from the Prime Minister’s speech to the House of Commons,
August 20, 1940.)

Almost a year has passed since the war began. It is natural for us,
therefore, to pause on our journey at this milestone and survey the

90   [30’s.

dark, wide ﬁeld. It is also useful1 to compare the ﬁrst year of this
second war against German aggression with its forerunner a quarter
of a century ago.

Although this war is, in fact, only2 a continuation of the last, very
great differences in its character are apparent. In the last War millions
of men fought by hurling enormous masses3 of steel at one another.
Men and shells was the cry, and prodigious slaughter was the conse—
quence.

In this war nothing of this kind has yet appeared. It is a conﬂict“'
of strategy, of organization, of technical operators, science, mechanics,
and morale.

The British casualties in the first twelve months of the great war“
amounted to 365,000. In this war, British killed, wounded, prisoners,
and missing, including civilians, are about 92,000; but6 of these a large
proportion are alive as prisoners of war. Throughout all Europe for
one man killed or wounded in this first year, perhaps ﬁve were killed
or wounded in7 1914-1915. '

The slaughter is but a fraction, but the consequences to the bel-
ligerents have been even more deadly. We have seen greats countries
with powerful armies dashed out of coherent existence in a few weeks.
We have seen the French Republic and the renowned French Army

beaten into complete9 and total submission with less than the casual— _

ties which they suffered in any one of the half dozen of the battles of
19l4-1918.1‘)

The entire body——it might almost seem at times the soul—of France
has succumbed to physical effects incomparably less terrible than those
which were sustained“ with fortitude and undaunted will power
-twenty—ﬁve years ago. .

Although up to the present the loss of life has been mercifully
diminished, the decisions reached” in the course of the struggle are
even more profound upon the fate of nations than anything which has
ever happened since barbaric times. . . .

The enemy is, of course,” far more numerous than we are. But
our new proa'uctz'on already largely exceeds his, and the American
production is only just beginning to How in. Our” bomberand ﬁghter
strength after all this ﬁghting is larger than it has ever been.

We hope and believe that we shall be able to continue the struggle
