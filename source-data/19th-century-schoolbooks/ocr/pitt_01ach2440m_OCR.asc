God intrusts to all
Talents, few or many;
None so young or small
That they have not any.
Thouglh tile great and wise
Have a greater number,
Yet my one I prize,
And it must not slumber.
God will surely ask,
Ere I enter heaven,
Have I done the task
Which to me was given?
Little drops of rain
Bring the springing flowers,
And I may attain
Mulch by little powers.

The Stars are coming.
See, the stars are coming
In the far blue skies;
Mother, look! they' brighten,
Are they angels' eyes?
No, my child; the lustre
Of the stars is given,
Like the hues of flowers,
By the God of lheaven.
Mother, if I study,
Sure he'll make me know
Why the stars he kindled
O'er our earth to glow.
Child, what God created
Has a glorious aim;
Thine it is to worship;
Thine to love his name.

To TEACHERS. - The child should have a slate and
pencil, and use them in trying to make letters, almost
as soon as he begins to go to school. Let him draw
any thing, -it keeps him from being idle, if nothing
more. But the teacher will find that he will learn to
print and write, and will do better in his other studies,
and will be more orderly, if so nemployed a part of the

This Reader is recommended, in the highest terms,
by all the most distinguished publickand private teachers of Boston and its vicinity, as'e1ll as by the most
eminent of Philadelphia. Its daill increasing popularity, and its adoption"'9a- take book in the State

and utility. Some who have bee?he most successful,
as teachers of elocution, in impartihg a distinct articulation and a correct pro      y that they cannot
in any other way, than by the use of these Exercises,
produce even an ordinary degree of excellence in these
most essential points. They have been found so indispensable, that they are extensively used even in high
schools and academies. These Exercises are presented
in the only proper form, as practical teachers assert, to
be of any use to the pupil. The public can here find
arranged for daily practice, in one book, what has since
been scattered by others through a wuhole series of
Readers. Committees and teachers are requested to
call or send for copies of the " Improved Edition," and
examine for themselves, before they have poorer books

DAVID B. TOWER, A. M.,
Formerly Principal of the Eliot Grammar School, Boston,
and late Principal of the Pennsylvania Institution for the
Instruction of the Blind, Author of the "Gradual Reader, or
Exercises in Articulation," and of the "Gradual Primer, or
Primary School Enunciator."
The rapid and extensive sale of this Algebra is the
best testimonial of its merit. A great number of the
most eminent teachers, as may be seen by reference to
the book, have expressed a high opinion of its value,
and of the need of such a book. Although intended
for common schools, it has already been adopted in
some of the best hig.-scchools in the state.
"The exercises of this Algebra gradually lead the
pupil, step by step,, from the simplest to more complicated reasoning;'teahin"'only one thing at a time,
and rendering that one thing familiar, before the attention is called to another."
c" Oral Exercises in Algebra, in which all the operations are limited to such small numbers as not to embarrass the reasoning powers, but, on the inductive
plan, to lead the pupil understandingly to higher mental efforts."
Teachers say " this work holds the same position in
reference to Algebra that' Colburn's First Lessons
does to Arithmetic."  Written Algebra can also be
taught from it. A KEY has been published for the
convenience of teachers, contaiting a solution of
each questionGRADUAL PRIMER.11

NOTE. TO TEACHERS. -The small letters are here Coupled from
some similarity in shape, that, by the teacher's aid, the pupil may
observe in what respects these letters resemble each other, and
whereiin they differ. The capital letters, which have been taught
in the preceding lessons, are placed over the small letters, to assist
the pupil in learning the latter, and to enable him to study the lesson
by himself, after the points of resemblance and difference between
any two have been pointed out by the teacher. Thisewill be his
first effort to study by himself; and he should be encouraged and
assisted in doingl it; at tlle same tilne, he should,rnderstand distinctly that it snust be done. No time, attention, nor exertion, on
the part of the teacher, should be spared, that will contribute to the
success of the pupil's first attempt to stuidy. The importance of a
correct begitmuing, in this respect, is often sadly overlooked.

NOTE TO TEACHERS.- The above, and the following lessons,
in making the'small letters familiar, are intended for an exercise on
the long or'name s.ound of the vowels. No reading lesson of phrases,
With short.words, canl beaddetd till the pupil has learned a few of the
poiwers;of the vowels, as the different soun'ds of thle same; vowel
wou'id on'ly confuse him, and render.the exercise worse.than useless.
In teaching only one tlhing at a tim'e, it is as preposterous as unphilosopihlical, to jtlmble,'as some -have done, in an exercise on'one
piarticular s6und, the various powers of the vo.wels, especially to use
indiscriliminately' different powers, of the same vowel, before the child
has been introduced to them, and to inflict themn upon him  under
the name; of an easy reading lesson, composed, it is true, of little
words,; but:.coUtaining an. awful complication of heterogeneous
sounds, entirely out. of place, inasmuch as the chlild is first supposed
to knowz them, and afterzwards. lessons are given. expressly for him to
learn those very sounds, one by one. As "soon'as -the cifild is prepared for an exercise in slhort phrases it will be introduced..

REMARKS TO TEACHIERS. -The pupil should sound the vowe,
element in the word first, anid then by itself, till hie can give it clearly,
fully, and distinctly. He should be tauglit that e,',at'the end bf.these
words, preceded as it is by a vowel and. a consonant, hlas.no sound.
The caption is for the teacher, whoi will do'well to refer'to the'" Exercises in Articulation," in the:"' Gradual Reader,"' from which
these lessons are taken: those.' Exercises,' will aid him in attaining tle pure sounds of the elemelltis.:  
The first sound of'a and of i, each, ends in e.' Thiis will be seen
by prolonging tle sound of each.- See note, p. 19.
If. the.first sound of o:be prolonged, it will be found that it closes
with the sound of oo, or of o in the word move. It is necessary to
observe this,. and nicely to regulate the- duration of time' uponthe
commencing and the closing sound of -the elernelit; because its purity must depend upon giving each the just and due proportioh of time,
without drawlinig either.
The first sound of- u, as given in Lessonl XV., on the next page,
is seldom given witli purity. It is like ew in the word snew; commencing with the first sound of e, as may be observed by prolonging

REMARKS TO TEACHERS. - The abbve table is intended to
exercise the organs of articulation, in al review of the first or long
sounds of the vowels, with greater facility, by bringing them together.
The pupil should first utter the element alono, thlen the words containing it, and lastly the elemnient again.:This may often be done simlultaneously by a class, and it will encourage the. pupil to utter the elements in a fuller tone, when lhis own is bleilded withl other voices.
The teacher must give frequent illustrations of these sounds with his
own voice, as they are best learned by imitation. Constant recurrence to this table will bejmet by a corresponding inmprovement in
the pupil.' See "Exercises in Articulation,':' in the " Gradtual Reador," published in 1841, in. which all the elementary sounds of the
vowels anid consonants, both alone and in tlheir various comnbinations,
are, for the first time, fully illustrated by exaimples for practice. Those
"Exercises" are said to be so useful, that no teacher sllould be
witlhout them.
The teacher-should give the element forcibly, by itself, and then in
the word, and the pupil: should do the same after him. As fast as
the ele?nentary sounds are learned, they will be set'before the pupil in
short and simnple sentences, containing no vowel element on the sound
of which he has not been previously exercised.  uticlh are theph7 ases
given on p. 21, as in the "Exercises" of the "Gradual. Reader,",.which te teacher should consult for the correct sounds of the elements, particularly the table oi p. 22.
* Make the pupil lhere observe, that c has tile sound of s before e,
i, and y; but, before all other letters,-it has the sound of k; thus, can
on the next page is pronounced kan.
In the word have, on the next page, a has its short sound., although
it is succeerled by a consonaint and silent e. This is one of the e:ccep
tions to the,.-.neral rule.GRADUAL PRIMER.    21

Let him    go if he will.
We will go to the mill.
To THE TEACHER. - The forcible utterance of thle
short vowels is the onlly way to attain excellence in
these sounds. There is no fear that the voice will be
too effectually drilled in any of the elements; but there
is much reason to fear that they will be slighted,GRADUAL PRI MERR.

To TEACHERS.- All indistinctness in nreading arises from disregarding the true sound of.ui'accente}d vowvels, and from inability
to give combinations of consonants their proper sound. But accuracy
and force in uttering combined sounds can, only, be attained by the
mechanical labor of drilling the voice tht'roughly on' the individual
elements, first separately, and then togetl!er.
It will be observed th,tt all the lines in these lessons are to be read
across the page. The samne course is.to'be pursued as.in'the preceding lessonl. Give the short vozwel, then the syllable, anid lastly the
consonant element alonle. After tuttering each weord, give'the consonant element by itself, proceeding. across the page. By giving the
element forcibly, the pupil will soon. acquire distinctness in uttering it...
In giving the elementary soutnd,of the vocal consonant m, the lips
are closed, and the voice passes through the nose; as mnay be noticed
in the alteration of the sound when the nose is compresed.'Hence
it is called a nasal, and by some a labial, from the'peculiar position
of the lips. (See Lesson XXXIV.)
* Sound the short,vowel, then the syllable, prolonging the sound so
as to observe the positions of the organs, and then, with the tongue
and lips retaining the same position,'sound, alone. Do this repeatedly. In sounding 1, the tip of the tongue presses the upper gums,
near th. te'tt; hence it is called a dental.GRAD)UAL PRiMIER.    33

To TEACHERS. --The sound of the aspiratef is made by merely
expelling the breath through tile teeth with a portion of the under lipl
between them. It has a sharp sound, and is called a labial, from tllhe
poSition of tie lip.
Let the teacher utter the short sound of e, then the syllable ef, then
time elementf, dlone; and let the ptpil repeatsthe same after him. Do
tllis with all the short vowel elements given at the head of these
I fsons, just as in the preceding. Then let the pupils together give
the woords, repeating the element under practice, before or after each
word, according to its position. The teacher, will never be at loss
for the true sound of the element, if he prolongs the syllable, and
~ notices the closing sound.
The sound of the vocal consonant v is made by placing the under
lip between the teeth, and then uttering the voice, which makes a
modified murtnuring, mixed with breath, as it.passes the teethl.
Care must be taken to avoid the sound of the sharpelementf. This
can easily be done by giving it as much voice as possible. The

TO TEACHERS. - The elementary sound of the aspirate s is made
by placing the tip of the tongue against the gums of the upper teetl,
and expelling the breath, thereby producing a. hiss. This element is
called an aspirate, because it is made by the breath; and a dental,
from the position of the tongue in respect to the teeth. Care must be
taken not to prolong this element, bult to make -the sound as short,
and to give it as quickly, as possible. This should be insisted on.
At the same time, the element should be uttered forcibly, as well as
suddenly. From a disregard of these precautions, or perhaps a total
ueglect of practice on the true sound of the consonant, the reading
of many is highly disagreeable.
To give the sound of the vocal consonant z, (see Lesson XL., next
page,) the tip of the tongue, as in uttering sharp s, must touch the
gums of the upper teeth, and the voice-must pass only between the
tongue and gums, consequently with a mixture of breath. Care
must be taken in uttering this element, lest it should too much resemble the sound of shlarp s. The best way to avoid this error is, to
give as much voice as possible to the element, and to utter it with
greatforce. The sound of this consonant may be prolonged at first,
in order to get it correctly; but the pupil should-afterwards be accustomed to give it a short and quick sound, as far as he can contsistently, without sacrificing its distinctive purity. From the position of the organs in its utteranse it is called a dentalGRADUAL PRIMERI      3i,I E!~   I'.,

To TEACHERS.- The sharp sound of the consonant t is formed
by pressing the tip of the tongue against the gums of tlle upper
teeth, so ass momentarily to.stop the issue of voice, or rather breath,
and then, by a sudden withdrawal of the tongule fioln that position,
suffering it to escape. Hence it is called' a dent:l. Tihis element
cannot be prolonged. The purity of its sounid depends upon the
celerity with which this movement of the toingue is execulted. Too
much breath must not be mingled with the sound. Ift' this be properly guarded against, abrupt force mayi.be profitably expended on its
utterance.; Consonatit sounds require the most active and forcible
exertion' of the organs, and the vocal consonants shoulld be uttered
with as much voice as the position of the organs will allow.
The consonant d (Lesson XLII) is the flat souind of t.  The
organs must be in the situation to give the sound of t; tthen the
voice must be suddenly propelled, and at the withdrawal of the
tongue a little fronn its position against the teeth of tl-le upper gums,
the sound is completed. It is heard, however, before the withdrawal. Care must be taken that the sound of t is not too prominent in giving this eleument, when fi,al. When initial in a syllable,
it glides easily into' the sound of the succeeding vowel, and, like
many other consonants, it loses all its roughnmess in the sound of the
vowel. This element can be prolonged with great effect, but it
chiefly requires a strong impulse of the voice. In order to acquire
a distinct entmnciatioin of the consonants, each of them in turn must
be made the object of exercise.GRADUAL:'RIM:d t..4

TO TEACHERS. -The sound of the consonant k is formed by
raising the middle-of the tongue towards the roof of the mouth near
the throat. This enables us to let the voice rush out, or to stop it, at
will. The consonant c has the sound of this eletnent before a, o, ts,
1, r, or t, and the sound of the element s, before e, i, and y. The
pupil should be often reminded of this, by appropriate questions%
such as, What sound has cG before -? - naming the letter,- and
why?  Some care is requisite to avoid too great an emission of
breath in giving this element; yet much explosive force may well be
applied to it.
The sound of the consonant element g (Lesson XLIV.) is made
with the organs in the same position as in uttering k, it being thefiat
sound of k. At the same time, the voice must be heard coming from
the throat till the organs separate. This sound may be prolonged,
and much force should be employed in its utterance, till it can
be given clearly and distilnctl.  It is the hard or gmmttural sound
of g. Before e and i, or its equivalent y, g has a soft sound, the
same as j, which is composed of two elements, d and zh. The pupil
should be questioned on the sound of g, as required in reference to
the consonant c, which sometimes represents k, and sometimes s,
but has no distinctive elementary sound.

To TEACHERS. - The sharp sound of the consonant element tP
is produced by placing the tip of the tongue between the teeth, and
breathing, or trying toopronounce the consonant s, with the.'organs
in that situhation. Care mtust be taken not to touch the gutms witlh
the tongue before placing it between the teeth, in sounding this ele
ment. Words ending in tlh, except verbs, have'generally the sharp
sound. This sound is seldom givein correctly by foreigners, tlhough,
by observing the directions given above, it will be found very simple
and easy. Defective articulation is generally the consequence of
early inattention or bad examssple, confirmed into a habit. Let the
directions for the proper position of the organs, under the respective
lessons, be duly observed, and the defects will be eradicated.
The Jlat sound of the element th7 (Lesson XLVI.) is formed by
placing the organs iii the same situation as in sounding th sharp,.and
then uttering thevoice, or trying to sound the element z. A sudden
and forcible impulse of the voice will make this vocal element clear
and prominent. It can be prolonged, to illsure accuracy in the position of the organs, and purity in its utterance. At the end of verbs,
when followed by silent e, and in some other situations, th has its gat
or vocal sound. Articulating the elements separately is, and'ought
to be, the child's first step; aind the righjt place or time for taking this
step is at the very outset. The labor of uindoing is greater, far
greater, than any.effort of acquisition.GRADUAL PRiMER.      45

To TEACHERS. -In uttering the simple' element ng, the voice
passes through the nose, as in giving the consonant n, butthe middle
of the tongue is elevated towards the roof of the mouth, while the
nasal sound is going on. This element is generally sounded correctly when under accent, and as generally incorrectly when not under
accent. The word running is uttered as if written runnin. This is
a great blemish; and yet jno habit is more difficult to be overcome
than a defective enunciation of this element. JMinutes spent in
practice on its trite sound, will save hosrs ahd days of reiterated and
often fruitless effort to remedy the evil, by correction in the ordinary
course of instruction in reading.
In giving the sound of the consonant s, the tongue is applied to
the gums of the upper teeth:; but to pronounce the element-'sh, (see
Lesson XLVIII.,) the tongue is drawn farther inwards than in
sounding s, and is directed towards the palate, not so close, however, as to touch it. Thus more space is left for the propulsion of
the breath, and the aspirated element sh is produced. This sound
should be prolonged, that the pupil may attain correctless in its
utterance; but he should also be well exercised in making it as
short as possible, and giving it abruptly, especially when final. Facility in placiug the organs in the right position must depend entirely upon their flexibility; and this can only be secured -by continued
practice on the elements singly.GRADUAL PRIMFR      47

To TEACHERS., - In drilling a pupil on the element p, let himn
join the lips with a'strong compression, and then let hin separate
them again; the slight noise caused'by separating the organs is all
that will be heard. If a vowel follow p, the lips are separated with
a kind of explosion, which glides into the Vowelsound, and'which
is evidently the effect of the consonant, resulting from the position in
which it has required the organs to be placed for its formation. Exercises on this element alone, then, can only have reference to the
proper position of the organs; but the pupil'will be benefited not a
little by separating the lips, and letting the explosive effect be given,
without union with a vowel. Let him be chiefly exercised on this
elesment in combination with some vowel sound.
The consonant b (Lesson L.) is considered as the fpat sound of p.
The lips should be in the same position, but with less compression
of the organs. In the mean while, an' obscure sound of voice will be
heard within the mouth, as if striving to force a passage, but it will
cease as soon as the organs separate. This sound should' be prolonged, for exercise, as much as possible - and all the force in our
power should be given to it. Much time can be profitably spent in
practice on this element.'It is extremely difficult to utter it in some
of its combinations with other consonants; and this difficulty can-be
removed only by first practising olt it alone. It should be done
thoroughly and efficiently, till each pupil has acquired a reasonable
degree of facility in its execution.GRADUAL PRIMER.     4.9

5--PREFACE C E
SINCE the publication of the "Gradual Reader," 0' Exercises in Articulastion," the author has been repeatedly urged to prepare a set of Primary Readers on
the same principle, using only such of the "' Exercises"
as are especially adapted to beginners,. and suiting
them to their progress. To supply the demand for
such a series, the want of which has been so often seen
or so extensively felt by others, this little book has
been prepared; which, it will be seen, is but an epitome
of the first part of those Exercises. The vowel or consonant element has been set forth' as an exercise by
itself, then the same element in words, and finally these
words in sentences, suited to the progress of the pupil,
on the-plan of the "' Gradual Exercises," to which the
teacher is respectfully referred. These Exercises were
published before teachers were generally prepared for
them; but public opinion now requires that they should
be understood and taught, as the " first step" in reading. Their utility has been so clearly demonstrated, that
teachers now ask for them to be used at the very outset;
that the "first step." may be taken in--the right place.
Hence, easy examples have beein' culled from those
" Exercises," and the Primer is  w offered with the
hope that it will prove as useful in its place, as the
original " Exercises " are daily found to be by the most
accomplished and successfulteachers. Since the " Exercises" were put forth,'other books have been constructe'd on the very same plan; affording a strong
confirmation of the utility and necessity of this method
of instruction. The author claims an improvement on
his original " Exercises," in giving full and explicit
directians for the utterance of these elementary sounds,50

Let us read in this new book
TO TEACHERS. - The rolgh or triled sound of the consonant r
Is made by placing the tongue in much the same position as in giving
the element s, but at a little distance from the upper gums; and then,
by propelling the voice and breath with violence, the top part of the
tongue will be jarred against them, making a rolling or whirring
noise. This is its sound when it precedes avowel.' Great care must
be taken, in executing this element, that too much roughness or trill
is not given to it. There is a nicety in its utterance which is seldom
attained, and yet it must be sought for earnestly. Overdone, it is
peculiarly harsh and disagreeable. One clip of the tongue, or one
trill is the safest coulrse to be adopted as a general rule. It is given
snore easily in combination, preceded by some consonant, than as an
initial sound.
Y, (Lesson.JI.,) at the beginning of a word or syllable, is the
representative of a consonant, and is formed by a forcible action
of the organs when in the position for uttering the vowel souhd,
long e. The action must be quick as well as forcible. This may be
exemplified by sounding', and uniting it with ou; at first, giving e
its full quantity, then gradually shortening the sound, and making
it quicker and quicker, till the elements coalesce, and the word yout;s produced. It will be difficult for the pupil to give the element
atsne, but it is best that he should try to do so. At any rate, he
should practise it -in conjunction with a vqovel sound, as in the
words of the exercise given';onnext'page.GRADUAL PRIMER.     51

John is too weak to run far.
He will come as soon as lie can.
We may as well wait for him.
He can wear my coat.
I will take it with me.
TO TEACHERS. - W, at the beginning of a word or syllable, is
the representative of a consonant, and is formed, by a quick and
forcible action of the organs, when in the pposition for uttering the
vowel sound oo. The same directions will apply to it as were given,
for uttering y. Sound oe, and then unite the sound' with the word
all; at first slowly; and then, shortening the sound of o, make it
quicker and quicker, till it coalesces with the vowel sound in all,
and the word wall will be produced.' This will show the true sound
of this element, and on what it is based. The pupil may thus learn
the proper position of the organs for the correct and easy utterance
of this elementary sound.
The sound of the consonant h (Lesson LIV.) is merely a forcible
expulsion of the breath. Hence it is called an aspirate. It can be
best exemplified for the pupil, by first uttering the syllable at, and
then uttering it again while emitting the breath, and the word hat
will be clearly heard. The propulsion of the breath should be quick
and forcible. This impulsive emission of breath easily unites with
the sound'of the succeeding vowel, thus losing much of its natural'
harshness.
Each teacher can best regulate for himself the amount of practice
on these elements. Unfortunately the child speaks, and often reads
words, before he has acquired a correct utterance of the separate
elements. To these he must go back, before fundamental errors can
be eradicated.GRADUAL PRIMER.-    53

You have made a queer pen.
I will get you a new                    quill.
To TEACHERS. - For the sound of q, see Exercise XLIIT., on
the element k. This is not given as an exercise on a, new elementary
sound, but as an element already illustrated,,and only represented
here by a differently shaped letter. It -was represented, in the
Exercises of the Gradual Reader," under the same head as k and
hard c; but for the child it is better, perhaps, that it should here be
given in a separate lesson.' The sound of the combination kswcan be
found at once, by taking the word queen, and pronouncing it atfirs,
slowly, thus, koo-een; then the first pas-t more and more rapidly, till
Vse sound is suddenly or.explosively joined with that of the vowel S.
This combination, or diphthoigal consonant sound,; will require
attention to insure an easy and efficient utterance.
In forming the eleinent zli, (Lesson LVI.,) the organs must be in
the position to sound sh, asnd the voice must issue with the breath.
Let the pupil give utterance to his voice with an open mouth, asnd,
while doisng this, place his tongue'as if he were to'.sound sh, the
voice still flowing, and the right sosunsd of this element'will be heard.
This is the fjat sound of sh, and it.should be prolonged, at first, to get
it correctly; afterwards let it be given quickly and forcibly. The
word roluge closes with the sound of this element, and should be
pronounced as if it were written seoozh. The consonants z and s
generally represent this element, when they are followed by long u
or a diphthollg, and preceded by a vowel under accent.GRADUAL PRIMER.       55

TO TEACHERS.-The consonantsj and soft g, it will be seen,
are not simple elements, but representatives of a combination of the
two elements d and zh. Let them be uttered with one impulse of
the voice.
The consonant z (Lesson LVIII.) is not a simple element, but it is
compounded of the elements k and s, as they are separately given in
Lessons XLIII. and XXXIX. respectively. The combination ks
requires a quick and short, but forcible souhd, without any prolongation of the closing element. The combination should be practised

Now we will feed the pigs.
These rags are for her doll.
I love to see dogs run.
Do not roll these logs.
By the air we exist.
TO TEACHERS. - Theflat sound of x is compounded of the elements g and z, as they are separately given in Lessons XLIV. and
XL. respectively. The combination gz must be uttered with quickness and force, that the elements may coalesce, and form one sound,
as nearly as possible. Try the elements separately, and then in
combination, till the organs can be chanlged from one required position to the other almost instantaneously, and with perfect ease.
In sounding swh, (Lesson LX.,) the order of the letters is always
reversed, even when they precede the vowel o;.but then, as the
sound of w is founded on that of oo, it coalesces with the succeeding
vowel sound. With this exception, both letters shouild be heard,
thus, when and wheel will be pronounced as if writtell hoo-en and
hoo-eel; butt the oo should be uttered so forcibly as to change the
vowel sound into that of a consonant.'3RADUAL PRIMER.    59

whereby the teacher may attain, as well as communi(ate, tl;e correct sound of each. These directions are
essential, especially to those whose early education
has been deficient in this respect, and who have consequently found it impossible to impart a distinct
articulation. Some teachers, very probably, are not
fully aware of their own deficiency and failure in this
important point.
Amid the conflicting opinions on the best method of
teaching a child to read, - whether letters or words
shall take precedence,--the author hopes that his
new plan, while it escapes the objections advanced
against either, will be found to imbody the advantages
of both. If reasonable and philosophical, it will commend itself to the common sense of the practical teacher
and the public, even though it should conflict with the
opinions of theorists, or the prejudices of those who
will keep the beaten track, crooked though it be, and
however rough to the unshod child.
The wisdom of forcing down a whole unmeaning
alphabet at once may well be questioned; but that
the rernedy hitherto applied is less objectionable, needs
practical confirmation.
The ntew feature in this little book consists in giving
the child only a few letters before he is called upon to
read words composed of those few letters. Thus the
child is taught words long before he has. learned the
whole.alphabet; and yet no -words are given him, of
which he 4has not previously learned the letters.
Another equally obvious advantaoge in this book, is
coupling letters which resemble each other, and teaching them together, that the. points of resemblance and
difference in their forms may be more easily recognized
fromn juxtaposition.  The author has fully tested the
value of the nezw method above, and of this last-mentioned
advaxntage, in teaching the blind. A blind boy, under
his charge, six years of age, w'th all his disadvantages,
has thus been taught, in six months, to read with facility in any part of the Bikle.60         GRADUAL PRIMER.

HEMARK    TO TEACHERS.--The pupil should be required to
give excluisive attention, for the time, to the letters iunder consideration; and let the time thus occupied be short.  The power of
giving undivided attention to any subject, is as invaluable as it is
difficult of attainment; but the difficulty is greatly increased if
habits of inattention are first acquired, to be. afterwards overcome

Safe watch will keep.
