distinguished for great ﬁrmness of character in general, and
alike remarkable for inflexible integrity and steadfast loyalty
to his king. 2. Such was the reputation he sustained, that,
even when the most violent antipathies against royalism
swayed the community, it was still admitted on all hands,
that farmer Stedman, though a tory, was honest in his opin-
ions, and ﬁrmly believed them to be right.

3. The period came when Burgoyne was advancing from
the north. It was a time of great anxiety with both the
friends and foes ofthe revolution, and one which called forth
their highest exertions. The patriotic militia ﬂocked to the
standard of Gates and Stark, while many of the tories resort-
ed to the quarters of Burgoyne and Baum. Among the lat-
ter was Stedman. 4. He had no sooner decided it to be his
duty, than he took a kind farewell of his wife, a woman of
uncommon beauty, gave his children, a twin boy and girl, a
long embrace, then mounted his horse, and departed. He
joined himself to the unfortunate expedition of Baum, and
was taken, with other prisoners of war, by the victorious Stark.

5. He made no attempt to conceal his name or character,
which were both soon discovered, and he was accordingly
committed to prison as a traitor. The gaoll, in which he
was confined, was in the western part of Massachusetts,
and nearly in a ruinous condition. 6. The farmer was one
night waked from his sleep, by several persons in his room.
“ Come,” said they, "‘ you can now regain your liberty: we
have made a breach in the prison, through which you can
escape.” 7. To their astorlislirricnt, Stedman utterly refused
to leave his prison. In vain they expostulated with him ; in
vain they represented to him that his life was at stake. 8. His
reply was, that he was a true man, and a subject of King
George; and he would not creep out of a hole at night, and
sneak away from the rebels, to save his neck from the gal-
lows. Finding it altogether fruitless to attempt to move him,

- . his friends left him, with some expressions of spleen.

9. The time at length arrived for the trial of the prisoner
The distance to the place where the court was sitting was
about" sixty miles. Stedman remarked to the sheriff, when
he came to attend him, that it would save some expense and
inconveriience, if he could be permitted to go alone, and on
foot. 10. “ And suppose,” said the sheriff, “that you should
prefer your safety to your honour, and leave me to seek you

in the British camp ’I’’ “I had thought,” said the farmer,
reddening with indignation, “that I was speaking to one
who knew me.” 11. “I do know you, indeed,” said the
sheriﬁ”; “I spoke but in jest; you shall have your Way.
Go, and on the third day I shall expect to see you at S .”
7*‘ * * "* The farmer departed, and, at the appointed
time, he placed himself in the hands of the sheriff.

152. I was now engaged as his counsel. Stedman insisted,
before the court, upon telling his whole story; and, when I
would have taken advantage of some tech’nical points, he
sharply rebuked me, and told me that he had not employed
me to prevaricate, but only to assist him in telling the truth.
"£23. I had never seen such a display of simple integrity. It
was affecting to witness his love of holy, unvarnished truth,
elevating him above every other consideration, and presiding
in his breast as a sentiment even superior to the love of life.
14. I saw the tears more than once springing to the eyes of
his judges. Never before, or since, have I felt such an inter-
est in a client. I pleaded for him as I would have pleaded
for my own life. I drew tears, but I could not sway the
judgment of stern men, controlled rather by a sense of duty,
thaii the compassionate promptings of humanity. 15. Sted-
man was condemned. I told him there was a chance of
pardon, if he would ask for it. I drew up a petition, and re»-
quested him to sign it; but he refused. 16. “ I have done,”
said he, “ what,I thought my duty. I can ask pardon of my
God, and my king; but it would be hypocrisy to ask forgive-
ness of these men, for an action’ which I should repeat, were

 

I placed again in similar circumstances. 17. No I ask me not "

tr. sign that petition. If what you call the cause of Ameri-
can freedom requires the blood of an honest man, for a con-
scientious discharge of what he deemed his duty, let me be
its victim. 18. Go to my judges, and tell them, that I place
not my fears nor my hopes in them.” It was in vain that I
pressed the subject; and I went away in despair.

19. In returning to my house, I accidentally called on an
acquaintance, a young man of brilliant genius for painting.
$38. This led him frequently to take excursions intp the coun-
try, for the purpose of sketching such objects and scenes as
were interesting to him. 21. From one of these rambles he
had just returned. I found him sitting at his easel, giving

the last touches to a picture. He asked my opinion of it.“
‘.‘ It is ‘a fine picture,” said I; “is it a zrfaiicy piece? or are ,

they portraits ?” 22. “ They are pm-trai,‘€‘s,”,said he, “ and,

save perhaps a little embellishment, they are, I think, strik—
mg portraits of the wife and children of your unfortunate cli-
ent, Stedman. 23. In the course of my rambles, I chanced
to call at his house in H I never saw a more beautiful
group. The mother is one of a thousand; and the twins
are a pair of cherubs.” 24. “ Tell me,” said I,- laying my
hand on the picture, “tell me, are they true and faithful por~
traits of the wife and children of Stedman ?” 25. My earn--
estness made my friend stare. He assured me that, so far
as he could be permitted to judge of his own productions,
they were striking representations. I asked no further ques-
tions ; I seized the picture, and hurried with it to the prison
where my client was confined. 26. I found him sitting, his
face covered with his hands, and apparently "wrung by keen
emotion. I placed the picture in such a situation, that he
could not fail to see it. I laid the petition on the little table
by his side, and left the room.

27. In half an hour I returned. The farmer grasped my
hand, while tears stole down his cheeks; his eye glanced
first upon the picture, and then to the petition. He said
nothing, but handed the latter to me. I took it, and left the
apartment. He had put his name to it. The petition was
granted, and Stedman was set at liberty. "

LESSON LX.
Surtday .7lI0rning.——-II. WARE, J R.

1. Mn. BENSON had informed me of the Sunday regulations
of his house, and I was, therefore, not surprised to ﬁnd the
family risen and assembled at an early hour. 2. It is a cus-
tom with many to indulge themselves with a later sleep than
usual on this day; and I have not been inclined to censure
it in those whose severe toils, during the week, have been

A unremitting, and whose bodies need the kindly rest of the

seventh day. 3. But I have often wondered that religious
people, who can plead no such excuse, and who know the
value of religious exercises, should so frequently squander
hours of Sunday morgnng in sleep, which, on other mornings,
would have been devoted to active duties. 4. Not so my
friend. “IfI can rise for gain,” said he, ‘,‘‘I can rise for
devotion; and I W7 my children to learn that teligioniits‘ a

5. The same mode of thinking seemed to be consistently
acted upon throughout the operations of the day. I have
never seen a household which seemed to me better ﬁtted to
be a model, or where the Sabbath seemed at once to be so
truly a delight, and so perfectlyto answer the purposes of its
institution. 6. The morning devotions, though longer than
I have sometimes known them, yet were not made tedious.
The master of the house interested his little audience by
making remarks as he read, by asking questions of the chil-
dren, and entering into conversation on the subject of the
chapter. 7. This saved it from being a merely formal ser-
vice; and I have seldom known so evident and deep inter-
est taken in the Scriptures, as was expressed in the attentive
eyes and pleased countenances of the family group.

8. After breakfast was over, Mr. Benson assigned the tasks
for his children, who quietly sat down to their study; and,
to my surprise, as well as gratiﬁcation, Mrs. Benson also en-
gaged herself with reading, which she interrupted only for
the purpose of instructing the children, until the bell rang
for worship. 9. I was charmed with the quietness of this
hour, and wondered how it had been redeemed from the
hustle and confusion by which it is marked in many families.
But I found the secret a very simple one. 10. It was the
resolution to relieve the day from all labour not absolutely
necessary, and to devote it to mental and religious improve-
ment. In the first place, no time had been lost in bed, so
as-to shorten the morning, and waste its hour in the hurry
of preparation for church. 11. In some families, there is
nothing but washing and changing clothes, and brushing
coats and shoes, and, perhaps, even the last stitches to be put
into some rent garment, or a button or a string to be replaced,

~' to make all “ tidy.” 12. And, in the midst of these various

operations, which bear the aspect, in the children’s eyes, of
being the most important of the day, and which are- just ﬁn-
ished in time for meeting, the affairs of the kitchen are to
be attended to, and the mistress must give directions for

dinner, and see that the pudding is prepared, and the sauces i

made ready. 13. So that, instead of quiet, it might seem a
little bedlam, and but a miserable preparation is made for
mingling in the worship of God’s house.

14. This was managed better at my friend's. “ All that
relates to cleanliness and clothing,” said Mrs. Benson, “is
done the day before, and the children are dressed for the day
on rising. Thus, the hour preceding service is without inter-

9 ’* ‘ i

1052 I; "I‘RODUC'I‘ION TO THE

ruption, and neither our thoughts nor tempers are disturbed
by unseasonable cares. 15. This I consider an excellent
habit for my children, as it teaches them to value the day
for its true objects, and prevents them from thinking, as ma--
ny do, that they go to church to show their clean clothes.
16 It redeems time, also, for their studies. For their tasks
are thus learned, the first thing, before their litt.le minds have
been distracted or wearied ; and then, for the remainder of
the day, pleasant books are put into their hands, as a reward
and an encouragement. 17. Much is done, in this way, to
form a taste for reading, and to make all their associations
with religion delightful.” ’

“ And you succeed in this '2” said I.

“Perfectly, thus far,” she replied; “I believe it is the
happiest day in the Week to them. 18. Nothing is suffered
to occur which shall irritate them, all occasions of annoyance
are removed, and we study a variety in their occupations,
which prevents any thing from becoming tedious.”

19. “ But there is still another advantage in this arrange-
ment,” said her husband. “ It redeems time for our own im-
provement, as well as for that of our children and domestics.
This quiet interval, in the cool of the morning, is a golden
opportunity. 20. Many are the volumes which we have
read together, which we never should have opened, if we
had passed our Sabbath mornings as many of our neighbours
do. Even my wife,” continued he, “has thus been able to
acquaint herself with books on divinity, which few men have
read?’

21. I wish that this hint might be enforced upon the at-
tention of our female friends. It happens with many ladies,
that, after they are at the head of families, they fancy they
have no time for the further improvement of their minds.
22. Their domestic cares are as much as they can attend to;
and, submitting to this as a sort of necessity, they lose what

I taste for books they once had, and dwindle down into very

common-place and ignorant women. 23. Now there seems
to me a great fault in this; and; without enlarging on the
subject, I will only say, that, if they will follow Mrs. Ben-
son’s plan, and redeem the Sabbath morning from waste,
they will ﬁnd it sufficient to keep alive their taste for proﬁta-
ble reading, at the same time that it will form, or at least
help them to, retain, their devotional taste. 24. And how
much might be gained, both tothe relish and the proﬁtof
the sanctuary, by the calm state of feeling, and the prepared

LESSON LXI.
Sunday Evem'ng.--Tm; SAME.

1. THE cheerful quietness and entire consistency of my
friend’s arrangements for the day, put my mind into a frame
peculiarly favourable for its religious enjoyments. It produ-
ced a more than usual portion of that

holy CALM within the breast,

of which the hymn speaks, and which, though so seldom
found, seems so truly the appropriate privilege of holy time.
2. How much depends on the state of our minds! At an-
other time, I might have fretted at the preacher as common-
place, dull, and wanting in matter; but now, every thing
sounded well, and I received it with interest. 3. The com-
plexion of my friend’s home had passed into my heart ; I was
in good humour with every thing about me; and was ready
to resolve, that, if such’, serenity could flow from a wise ar-
rangement of the day, I would not fail to put in practice the
hints I had received.

4. I had fallen into a musing posture, as thoughts like these
passed through my mind, when we had just returned from the
afternoon service. I was interrupted by the cheerful voices
of the children walking in the garden, near the window where
I was sitting. 5. I looked at them for some time, as they
passed backward and forward, playfully, but not noisily, and
thought that I had never seen happier countenances. They
were glowing with “ the sunshine of the soul.” 6. There
was evidently a restraint upon their movements, and they did
not indulge in loud and violent pleasure. But the restraint
was plainly voluntary, dictated by their own feelings, and
with no harshness in it to render it galling to them.

'7. “ This is their time for recreation,” said Mr.‘ Benson,
observing that I watched them. “Constant conﬁnement
and silence might lender the day tiresome to them, and its
return unwelcome,—and God forbid the Sabbath should be
so to a child of mine. 8. No——let it be a delight; and in
order to render it so, there must be recreation. I, however,

:04 INTRODIJCTION To i'rrn:‘<:

rnake a distinction between the pleasures of this and other
days, in order to ooriziiect with every hour of it a sacred asso-
ciation. Make it both pleasant and sacred, and it never will
lose its hold upon the heart.”

9. ‘We pursued the conversation, and the children were
left to themselves till we were summoned to an early supper.
“ 'We neither fast nor feast to-day,” said Mrs. Benson; “ but
we have one small luxury at tea. 10. We think it well to
connect as many pleasant associations with the day as possia
ble. Our children never see this dish at any other time.”
= '11. “ But, will you not lead them,” said I, “ to set an undue
‘E-'a:l‘11e on the gratiﬁcation of appetite?” i

1.53. “That might happen,” she replied, “-if we seemed to.
value it highly, or talked about it as a thing of consequence,
or ever used it by Way of reward or punishment. 13. But
we do neither; we simply introduce it as a matter of course,
because it is Sunday; they regard it as doing honour to the
day; and it seems to mingle itself in their minds with the
pleasant recollections of the season, and be lost among them.”

14. But I should never cease, were I to record all the good
hints which were dropped in the course of conversation, or
repeat every thing which made an impression on my mind.
I must hasten to the end. .

I5. Wheri this happy meal was ﬁnished, I had an oppon-
tunity of witnessing the mode in which the day was closed
by these careful parents. First, questions were asked re»
specting the religious exercises of public worship, and the
instructions of the day were recapitulated and enforced in
familiar conversation. 16. Then the brief lessons which had’
been learned were recited,—not from memory only, but care
was taken that all should be understood; and what the chi};-
dren did not appear to understand was patiently explained to
them ; and thisin so kind and familiar a way, that it exeia
ted their interest, and produced no fatigue upon their minds.

.17. It was done much more in the way of conversation

than of formal recitation. The subject was talked about, and
the children seemed to feel that they were partalters in what
concerned themselves. 18. VVhen this wasover, each was
called upon to repeat some hymn; and I never shall forget
the feelings which were excited by the manner in which one

of them was closed. 19. I had never seen the hymn before ;
but its simplicity and beauty, and appropriateness to the cir~.- ,
. ole in which the little lisper recited it, won my heart from the

very first verse. 20. And when she came. to the end, and

NATIONAL READER. 105

took her brother by the hand, while all the brothers and sis-
ters joined in a circle, and repeated together With her the
closing lines,-
Brothers and sisters, hand in hand,
_ Our lips together move;

Oh, smile upon this little band,
And join our hearts in love,—-

I cannot describe how affecting it was. 21. I was overcome.
I was melted. And I saw that tears stood even in the eyes
of the parents, who had heard it repeated a hundred times.
22. I felt as if such a prayer, from such a cherub band, must
indeed have a prevailing power; and I could almost fancy
that I heard a kind voice whisper, “ of such is the kingdom
qf heaven.”

23. After a rninute’s pause, the father read from the family
Bible as on the preceding evening, and then all united in
singing an evening hyrnn,———which, I found, always made a
part of the worship at this season. A fervent, but brief, act
of supplication and praise followed. 24. As it closed, the
setting sun poured his last iays upon the Wainscot, and disap-
peared beneath the horizon,—as if to cast his parting smile
upon such a scene, and rejoicing to carry with him the record
sf a family so employed. 25. And thus the day ended,--..»to
me a’ memorable one,———to be numbered with those which I
Sontemplate with satisfaction, and on which I never look
hack without being ready to exclaim, I have gained a day.

1. THE white ant is an insect of so curious and in’terest-
ing a description, and so little known, that I am induced to
offer a few particuiars, respecting its wonderful labours and
sagacious habits, to the attention of my young readers.

2. The works of the white ant as much exceed those of
the common ants, of bees, of wasps, and beavers, as the
buildings of the Europeans excel those of the Africans and
other uncivilized people.

3. The structures which the white ants erect rise toiten
or twelve feet in height above the surface of the earth.
These buildings are divided into separate compartments, the
most striking of which are the royal apartments, the nur-

series, magazines for provision, the arched chambers and
galleries, with their Various communications, the ranges of
Gothic-shaped arches, some of which are two or three feet
high, and the numerous roads and avenues, sloping stair-
cases, and bridges, which latter are constructed in such a
manner as to shorten the distance between the several parts
of the building. 4». In some parts of Senegal, the number,
magnitude, and closeness of these buildings, make them ap«-
pear in the distance l,il«:e the villages of the natives; and yet
the labourers employed in this service are not more than a
quarter of an inch in length. 5. There are three distinct
ranks or orders among them, constituting a well-regula.ted
economy. They are as follows : first, the labourers, or work-
ing insects; next, the soldiers, or ﬁghting order, who do no
kind of labour themselves, but super-intend the work of the
labourers, and are larger than the former, being equal in bulk
to about ﬁfty of them; lastly, the Winged, or perfect insect,
which may he termed the nobility of the state, for they nei-
ther ﬁght, give orders, nor work, being incapable of defending
themselves. 6. They are capable, however, of being elected
kings and queens; and nature has so ordered i.t,’that they
emigrate, shortly after they have been elevatedto this state,
and _ei,th_er ‘found new kingdoms, or perish, in the course of 3.
feW““da*'ys,-h‘y' becoming the prey of innumerable birds, fishes,
and reptiles. The first order, or labourers, are hy far the
most numerous, being in the proportion of a hundred to one
of the soldiers.

7. As soon as the labourers have elected. a king and queen,
they protect them from t.heir enemies, by enclosing them in
a chamber of clay, where the queen soon begins to lay l.l€‘l’
eggs, sometimes to the surprising number of eighty thousand
in the course of four-and-twenty hours. 8. These  are
instantly removed by her attendants, ofwhom there is always
a suﬁicient number, waiting in the royal chamber and adja-
cent galleries, and carried to the nurseries, which are some-
times five feet distant. 9. Here, after they are hatched, the
young insects are attended upon with the greatest care, and
provided with all things necessary for their support, till such
time as they are able to shift for themselves, and in their
turns take part in the labour of the community in general.

10. Many curious and striking particulars are related by
naturalists, of the devastations committed by these singular
insects, who occasion great loss to the cultivators of the soil,
by reason of the covered roads which they construct, diverg-

 ‘:2

NA'I_‘IONAL READER.‘ 107

big in all directions from the nest, and leading to every ob-
ject of plunder within their reach. 1].. Yet, such is the econ-
omy of nature, that the mischief they commit is sufficiently
counterbalanced by the good produced by them. 12. How
many things there are, that, at ﬁrst sight, appear to us as great
evils, or useless in the scale of creation, but which, on ma-‘
ture reflection, are found to be perfectly consistent with the
wisdom and goodness of that merciful Being, who planned
the beautiful world we inhabit!

13. These ter’mi’tés, or ants, indeed, are frequently perni-
cious to mankind; but they are also very serviceable, and
even necessary, in destroying dead trees and decayed sub-
stances, which, if left on the surface of the ground, in these
hot climates, would, in a short time, pollute the air.

 Such is the alacrity of these insects, in this office, that

they will, in the space of a few weeks, destroy and carry
away the bodies of large trees, without leaving a particle be-
hind them; thus clearing the place for useful vegetation,
which soon ﬁlls up every vacancy. 15. In places even where,
two or three years before, a populous town has ﬂourished,
(if the inhabitants have abandoned it from any cause, as is
frequently the case,) there shall spring up a thick wood, and
all trace of habitation disappear ; the ter’més not leaving even
the vestige of a post or beam, to encumber the face of the
earth. ' -
16. Such is the strength of the buildings erected by these
puny insects, that, when they are raised to little more than
half their height, it is the practice of the wild bulls to take ad-
vantage of their elevation, and stand as sentinels upon them,
while the rest of the herd are ruminating below. 17. When
at their full height, which is from ten to twelve feet above
the surface, they are used by the natives, and also by the
Europé’ans, as places to look out from, over the tops of the
long grass, which here grows to the astonishing height of
thirteen feet upon an average, so as entirely to obstruct the
View of distant objects.

18. The conduct of these creatures, if an attack is made
on their buildings, is very remarkable. At the first stroke
given by a hoe or pickaxe, a soldier immediately appears,
and walks about the breach, examining minutely the point
from which the attack was made. 19. in a short time, he is
followed by two or three more, who anxiously examine the
injury; these are quickly joined by others. and, in a short

a time, the whole body rush out as fast as the 'j:':::::.ch wiliotpcn

way of halter. 4. He came clattering up to the school-door
with an invitation to Ichabod to attend a merry-making, or
“quilting frolic,” to be held that evening at Mynheer Van
Tassel’s; and, having delivered his message with that air of
importance, and eﬂbrt of ﬁne language’, which a negro is apt
to display on petty embassies of the kind,—..he dashed over the
brook, and was seen scarnpering away‘ up the hollow, full of
the importance and hurry of his mission.

5. All was now bustle and hubbub vvi~r1,_j;:,,the late quiet school-
room. The scholars were hurried through their ' lessons
without stopping at triﬂes; those who were nimble skipped
over half with impunity, and those who were tardy had a
smart application, now and then, of the birch, to quickenitheir
speed, or help them over a tall word. 6. Books were thrown
aside without being put away on the shelves; ink-stands
were overturned, benches thrown down, and the whole school
was turned loose, an hour before the usual time, bursting forth
like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing about the
green, in joy at their early emancipation.

7. The gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half- '

hour at his toilet, brushing and furbishing up his best, and
indeed only, suit of rusty black, and arranging his looksghy a

A bit of broken looking-glass, that hung up in theschool-house.

8. That he might make his appearance before his mistress
in the true spirit of a cavalier, he borrowed a horse from the
farmer with whom he was d6micil’iated,-—a choleric old
Dutchman, of the name of Hans Van Ripper,——ai1d, thus
gallantly mounted, issued forth, like a knight errant in quest
of adventures.   ._

a story, give some account of the looks and equipments of my

hero and his steed. The animal he bestrode was a broken
down plough-horse, that had outlived almost every thing but
his viciousness. 10. He was gaunt and shagged, with a ewe
neck, and a head like a hammer; his rusty mane and tail
were tangled and knott.ed with burrs; one eye had lost its
pupil, and was glaring and spectral, but the other had the
gleam of a genuine demon in it. 11. Still he must have had
ﬁre a.nd mettle in his clay, if we may judge from his name,
which was Gunpowder. He had, in fact, been a favourite
steed of his master’s, the choleric Van Ripper, who was a
furious rider, and had infused, very probably, some of his
spirit into the animal; for, old and broken down as he look-
ed, there was more of the spirit of evil lurking in him than
in any young ﬁlly in the country.

12. Ichabod was a suitable ﬁgure for such a steed. He
rode with short stirrups, which brought his knees nearly up
to the pommel of the saddle; his sharp elbows stuck out
like grasshoppers’; he carried his whip perpendicularly in
his hand, like a sceptre, and, as his horse jogged on, the
motion of his arms was not unlike the ﬂapping of a pair of
Wings. 13. A small wool hat rested on the top of his nose,
--—for so his scanty strip of a forehead might be called,—and
the skirts of his black coat ﬂirted out almost to the horse's
tail. Such was the appearance of Ichabod and his steed, as
he shambled out of the gate of Hans Van Ripper, and it was
altogether such an apparition as is rarely to be met with in
broad day-light.

LESSON LXIV.
The Dog and tkc Fast.-GAY.

1. A SHEPHERIYS dog, unskilled in sports,
Picked up acquaintance of all sorts.
Among the rest a fox he knew;
By frequent chat their friendship grew.

Says Ren’ard, “ ’Tis a cruel case,
That man should stigmatize our race.
No doubt, among us, rogues you ﬁnd,
As among dogs and human kind;
And yet (unknown to me and you,)
There may be honest men and true.
3. “ Thus slander tries, whate’er it can,
‘ To put us on the foot with man.



NA FIONAL READER. Ill

Let my own aetions recommend;

No prejudice can blind a friend :

You know me free from all disguise;

My honour as my life I prize.”

By taik. like this, from all mistrust

The dog was cured, and thought him just.
As on a time the fox held forth

On conscience, honesty, and worth,

Sudden he stopped; he cocked his ear;
Low dropped his brushy tail with fear.

“ Bless us’! the hunters are abroad:

What’s all that clatter on the road ii”

‘‘ Hold,” says the dog; “ we’re safe from harm:

’’]‘was nothing but a false alarm.

At yonder town, ’tis market day;

Some farmer’s wife is on the way :

’Tis so (I Know her pie-bald mare,)

Dame Dobbins, with her poultry-wa,re.”

Reward grew huff. Says he, “ This sneer,

From You, I little thought to hear.

Your meaning in your looks I see ;

Pray, what.’s dame Dobbins, friend, to me?
Did I e’er make her poultry thinner?

Prove that I owe the dame a dinner.”

“ Friend,” quoth the cur, “I meant no harm.

Then why so captions’? why so warm’?

My words, in common acceptation,

Could never give this provocation ;

No Zamb=(for ought I ever knew)

May be more innocent than you.”

At this gelled Reward winced, and swore

Such language ne’er was given before.

“ What’s lamb to me ?—-—the saucy hint;
Show me, base knave, which way you squint.
If, t’other night, your master lost

Three lambs, am I to pay the cost?

Your vile reflections would imply

That I’m the thief. You dog, you lie.”

“ Thou knave, thou fool,” the dog replied,

“ The name is just, take either side;

Thy guilt these applications speak; V
Sirrah, ’tis conscience makes you squeak.”
So saying, on the fox he flies :—--

The self‘-convicted felon dies.

The Swallow and the T0rtoz'se.—EvENINGs AT llama.

1.

O‘!

A TORTOISE in a garden’s bound,
An ancient inmate of the place,
Had left his winter quarters under ground,
And, with a sober pace,
Was crawling O’er a sunny bed,

And thrusting from his shell his pretty toad-like head.

. Just come from sea, a swallow,

As to and fro he nimbly ﬂew,
Beat our old racer hollow:

At length he stopped direct in view,
And said, “ Acquaintance, brisk and gay,
How have you fared this many a day ?”

. “Thank you,” replied the close house-keeper;

“ Since you and I last autumn parted,
I’Ve been a precious sleeper,
And never stirred nor started;
But in my hole I lay as snug
As ﬂeas within a rug; _
Nor did I put my head abroad
Till all the snow and ice were thawed.”

“ But~I,” rejoined the bird,
“ VVho love cold weather just as well as you,
Soon as the warning blasts I heard,
Away I ﬂew,
And, mounting in the wind,
Left gloomy winter far behind.
Directed by the mid-day sun,
O’er sea and land my vent’rous course I steered,
Nor was my distant journey done,
Till Afric’s verdant coast appeared.

. “ There, all the season long,

I chased gay butterﬂies and gnats,
And gave my negro friends a morning song,
And housed, at night, among the bats.
Then, atthe call of spring, ‘V
I northward turned my wing,
And here again her joyous message bring.”

NATIONAI. READER. 113

C} “ Pshaw! what a deal of needless ranging,”
Returned the reptile grave ;
“ For ever hurrying, bustling, changing,
As if it were your life to save!
Why need you visit foreign nations?
Rather, like me, and some of your relations,
Take out a pleasant half-year’s nap,
Secure from trouble and mishap.”

7 “ A pleasant nap, indeed!” replied the swallow:
“ ‘When I can neither see nor fly,
The bright example I may follow:
Tillthen, in truth, not I!
I measure time by its employment,
And only value life for lif'e’s enjoyment :
As good be buried all at once,
As doze out half one’s days, like you, you stupid dunes 3”

LESSON LXVI.
The Hare and the Tortoise.--LLOYD.

I IN days of yore, when time was young,
When birds conversed as well as sung,
When use of speech was not conﬁned
Merely to brutes of human kind,
A forward hare, of swiftness vain,
The genius of the neighbouring plain,
Wollld oft deride the drudging crowd,
For geniuses are ever proud:
He’d boast, his ﬂight ’twere vain to follow;
For dog, and horse, he’d beat them hollow;
Nay, if he put forth all his strength,
Outstrip his brethren half a length.

2 A tortoise heard his vain oration,
And vented thus his indignation :—
“ O puss! it bodes thee dire disgrace,
When I defy thee to the race. A
Come, ’tis a match; nay, no denial;
I lay my shell upon the trial.”
’Twas “ Done !” and “ Done!” “All fair 3" “A bet E”
Judges prepared, and distance set. ,

3 The scampering hare outstripped the Wind;
The creeping tortoise lagged behind,

30 ll‘

H4 IN TRODUC'l‘I0r\" TO THE

And scarce had passed a single pole,
When puss had almost reached the goal.
“ Friend tortoise,” quoth the jeering hare.
“ Your burden’s more than you can bear ;
To help your speed it were as well

That I should ease you of your shell :

Jog on a little faster, pr’ytl1ee;

I’ll take a nap, and then be with thee.”

4. So said, so done, and safely, sure;

For say, what conquest more secure?
Whene’er he waked, (that’s all that’s in it,)
He could o’ertake him in a minute.

The tortoise heard his taunting jeer,

But still resolved to persevere ;

Still drawled along, as who should say,

“ I’ll win, like Fabius, by delay ;”

On to the goal securely crept,

While puss, unknowing, soundly slept.

5. The bets were won, the hare awoke,
When thus the victor-tortoise spoke :—-— .
“ Puss, though I own thy quicker parts,
T kings are not always done by starts ,-
You may deride my awkward pace,

But slow and steady wins the race.”

LESSON LXVII.

On the Zlligration and Habits of Birds of Passage.-—
A. WILSON.

l. To the philosopher, as well as the naturalist, and to
en:ry man of feeling, the manners, migration, a.nd immense
ITlultltUCl8S of birds in this country, are subjects of interesting
and instructive curiosity.

2. From the twenty-ﬁrst day of March to the ﬁrst of May,
it might with truth be asserted, that, at least, one hundred
million of birds enter Pennsylvania from the south; part on

their way farther north, and pa.rt to reside, during the season.

3. This is no extravagant computation, since it is allowing
only about four hundred individuals to each square mile;
though even those resident for the summer would, probably,
average many more. 4. Our forests are, at that season,
every where stored with them; and even the most gloomy
S\ViU¥l§),.~1 and morass’es swarm with their respective feathered

NATIONAL READER. 115

tenants, and the seats of cultivation contain a still greater
proportion. ll‘ ‘ll *‘ ll‘ ‘)5 *

 That these migrations are not performed in one con-
tinued journey, but in occasional and leisurely progression,
seems highly probable, from the length of time that usually
elapses,-between their ﬁrst entering the southern boundaries
of the United States, and their appearance in the Northern
and Middle States. 6. In 1809, the purple martens arrived
at Savannah on the second day of March, but did not reach
Philadelphia until the twenty-fifth day of the same month.
The cat-birds were first heard at Savannah early in March,
ha’: did not arrive in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia until
la‘s:e in April. 7. Many other species, whose arrivals were
rmtetl in the same season, at both places, varied from three
tr.) five weeks; among which latter number was the hum-
ming-bird, which arrived at Savannah about the twenty—third
of March, but rarely reaches Philadelphia before the first of
May’.

 In short, these little winged pilgrims, some of whom
have several thousand miles of country to pass over, in their
progressive advances north, seem to follow in the joyous
train of Spring, hailing her with their melody, while she un-
folds the infant leaves, spreads a carpet of living green over
the smiling ﬁelds, and diffuses warmth and balmy fragrance
over the face of nature. 9. By the ﬁrst of May, the whole
woods are vocal, and the great business of building and
incubation is going rapidly forward. The sexual attach-
ments are frequently formed before the arrival of the parties,
and some, doubtless, exist for several years. 10. During

"their continuance, the most perfect ﬁdelity seems to be ob-

served ; each being wholly devoted to the other. A spot is
selected, and mutually agreed on, for the site of their nest,
which is constructed by the joint labour and ingenuity of
both. 11. At this interesting season, how assiduous are their
labours! How patient does the zealous female sit, for days
and weeks, while the habitual love of activity, the charms of
the season, and every object around, seem to tempt her away !
12. And with what vigilance does her faithful partner stand
sentinel on some pinnacle near the spot, to guard her from
surprise, and to enliven the tedious hours with his cheerful
and animated song; visiting her in her conﬁnement, as an
affectionate husband would a beloved wife, feeding her from

. his mouth, and warbling to her in strains of soothing gratu-

lation! 13. When the naked, feeble, andchelpless brood

l 16 . INTRODUCTION TO THE

first. appear, every sensation of affection becomes more ex»
quisite, more ardent and active. They are never left for a
moment alone; oneparent usually watches their slumbers,
while the other is in search of food for their support. 14. All
night long, as well as during the cool damps of morning, and
on the appearance of the least inclemency of weather, the
mother covers them with her body, to secure them from the
slightest cold. 15. Should her mate fall by the cruelty of man,
she redoubles all her care, seems wholly engrossed by her
charge, and is herself their sole supporter, friend and protect-
or. VVhen, at last, danger comes suddenly, her affection is
never taken by surprise; she instantly throws herself be-
tween her young and their enemy, invites all his attention to
herself, and saves their lives at the expense of her own.

16. Is it possible for a rational and intelligent being to
contemplate-these scenes Without interest, and without ad-
miration? Innocency has charms that arrest almost every
beholder; and can we survey the sportive and endearing
manners of these creatures with indifference? 17. Men
join, with reverence, in praises to the great Creator; and
can they listen, with contempt, to the melodious strains, the
hymns of praise, which these joyful little beings offer up,
every morning, to the Fountain of light and life’! 18. VVho
can contemplate, unmoved, the distress of a fond mother for
her dying infant ’! And has that tender mother no claims on
our sympathy, who, unprotected herself, chooses death rather
than that her young should suffer? Are tenderness of heart,
ﬁdelity, and parental affection, lovely only when they exist
among men’! 19. 0 no: it is impossible! Those virtues,
that are esteemed the highest ornaments of our nature, seem
to be emanations from the Divinity himself, and may be
traced in many of the humblest, and least regarded, of his
creatures. —

LESSON LXVIII.
Sagacity Qf An-im.aZs.

1. To the instances of extraordinary sagacity in animals,
which we have already furnished for the amusement and in-
struction of our young readers, we add the following. from
the Cabinet of Curiosities. .

_ ‘.3. A gentleman, residing at Gosport, England, was, when
visiting Portsmouth, usually accompanied by his dog, in

NATIONAL READER.. 117

the ferry-boat. One day, it so happened, that the dog
lost his master somewhere in Portsmouth, and, surmising
that he had re-crossed the water for Gosport, sped his way
to the house of a bookseller in High Street, and, by every
possible means, intimated his misfortune. 3. “ What 1” ex-
claimed the shopman, “ you have lost your master, have you’!
Well, here is a penny, for your fare across the water.” The
dog snatched up the coin, ran directly to Point Beach, drop-
ped the penny into the hand of the Waterman, and was fer-
ried across with the other passengers. '

4. A dog, having been run over by a carriage, in one of
the streets of Paris, had his leg broken. A humane surgeon,
passing, had the animal brought home, set hisleg, and, hav-
ing cured his patient, discharged him, aware that he would
return to his old master. 5. The dog, whenever he met the
surgeon afterwards, never failed to ré’cognise him, by wag-
ging his tail, and other demonstrations ofjoy. One day, a
violent barking was heard at the surgeon’s door, which was
found to be occasioned by this dog, who, it appeared, was
striving to procure admittance for another dog, that had just
had his leg broken. _

6. We do not think that the records of iizstinct ever con-
tained a more extraordinary instance than the one which we
are now about to relate, and for the truth of which we pledge
ourselves. A few days since, Mr. J. Lane of Fascombe, in
Gloucestershire, on his return home, turned his horse into a
ﬁeld, in which it had been accustomed to graze. 7. ‘A few
days before, this horse had been shod all-fours, but, uniuckily,
had been pinched in the shoeing of one foot. In the morn-
ing, Mr. Lane missed the horse, and caused an active search
to be made in the vicinity, when the following singular facts
transpired. 8. The animal, as it may be supposed, feeling

lame, made his way out of the ﬁeld, by unhanging the gate

with his mouth, and went directly to the same farrier’s shop,
a distance of a mile and a half. The farrier no sooner open-
ed his shed, than the horse, which had evidently been stand-
ing there some time, advanced to the forge, and held up the
ailing foot. 9. The farrier instantly began to examine the
hoof, discovered the injury, took off the shoe, and replaced
it more carefully; on which the horse immediately turned
about, and set off, at a merry pace, for his Well known pas-
ture. IO. While Mr. Lane’s servants were on the search,

- they chanced to pass by the forge, and,.on mentioning their
I supposed loss, the farrier replied, “Oh, he has been here,

LESSON LXIX.
Example qf Perseverance.——W. SCOTT.

1. ROBERT BRUCE, after various unsuccessful attempts to
ascend the throne of Scotland, had been driven, by his ad-
verse fortunes, to retire, for a season, from his family and his
country, to the little island of Rachrin, on the coast of Ire-
land. Here, with the few men who had faithfully followed
him, he~=spent the winter of 1306. 2. In the mean time, his
youngest brother, whom he had left to defend the only castle
that remained to him in Scotland, was taken, and cruelly put
to death, by the English. His queen, too, with the ladies
that attended her, was thrown into strict conﬁnement, and
treated with the utmost severity. This news reached Bruce
while he was residing in a miserable dwelling at Rachrin,
and reduced him to the point of despair.

3. It was probably about this time, that an incident took
place, which, although it rests only on tradition in the fami
lies of the name of Bruce, is rendered probable by the man~
ners of the times. After receiving the last unpleasing intel-
ligence from Scotland, Bruce was lying one morning on his
wretched bed, and deliberating with himself whether he had
not better resign all thoughts of again attempting to make
good his right to the Scottish crown, and, dismissing his fol~
lowers, transport himself and his brothers to the Holy Land,
and spend the rest of his life in ﬁghting against the Saracens;
by which, he thought, perhaps, he might deserve the forgive-
ness of Heaven for the great sin of stabbing Comyn in the
church at Dumfries.

4. But then, on the other hand, he thought it would be '

both criminal and cowardly to give up his attempts t.o restore
freedom to Scotland, while there yet remained the least
chance of his being successful in an undertaking, which,
rightly considered, was much more his duty than to drive
the inﬁdels out of Palestine, though the superstition of his
age might think otherwise. ,

5. While he was divided betwixt these reﬂections, and
doubtful of what he should do, Bruce was looking upward
to the roof of the cabin in which he lay, and his eye was
attracted by a spider, which, hanging at the end of a long

N z1'I‘I()NAL READER, . 1 1

thread of his own spinning, was endeavouring, as is the fash-
ion of that creature, to swing himself from one beam in the
roof to another, for the purpose of ﬁxing the line on which
he meant to stretch his web. 6. The insect made the at-
tempt again and again without success; and at length Bruce
counted that it had tried to carry its point six times, and been
as often unable to do so. It came into his head, that he had
him self fought just six battles against the English and. their
allies, and that the poor persevering spider was exactly in the
same situation with himself, having made as many trials, and
been as often disappointed in what it aimed at. '7. _“ Now,”
thought Bruce, “ asI have no means of knowing What IS best
to be done, I will be guided by the luck which shall attend
this spider. If the insect shall make another effort to ﬁx its
thread, and shall be successful, I will venture a seventh time
to try my fortune in Scotland; but,if the spider shall fail, I
will go to the wars in Palestine, and never return to my na-
tive country again.”

8. While Bruce was forming this resolution, the spider
made another exertion with all. the force it could muster, and
fairly succeeded in fastening its thread on the beam, which it
had so often, in vain, attempted to reach. Bruce, seeing the
success of the spider, resolved to try his own fortune; and,
as he never before gained a victory, so he never afterwards
sustained any considerable check or defeat. 9. I have often
niegfwith people of the name of Bruce, so completely persua-
dediof the truth of this story, that they would not, on any
account, kill a spider, because it was such an insect which
had shown the example of perseverance, and given a signal
of good luck, to their great namesake.

Notch in the W’/tite ZlI0un.taz'ns.——J. T. BUCKINGHAM.

]. Tim sublime and awful grandeur of this passage baffles
all description. Géoin’etry may settle the heights of the
mountains; and numerical ﬁgures may record the measure;
but no words can tell the emotions of the soul, as it looks
upward, and views the almost perpendicular precipices which
line the narrow space between them; while the senses ache
with terror and astonishment, as one sees himself hedged in
from all the world besides. 2. He may cast his eye forward,
or backward, or to either side ;=~—~he can see only upward,

1:30 I3€’l‘itODUC'I'ION T0 'l‘HE

and there the diminutive circle of his vision is cribbed ant .

conﬁned by the battlements of nature’s “ cloud-capped tow-
ers,” which seem as if they wanted only the breathing of a
zephyr, or the wafting of a straw against them, to displace
them, and crush the prisoner in their fall. 3. Just before our
Vlslt to this place, on the twenty-sixth of June, 1826, there
was a tremendous awalanche, or slide, as it is ‘there called,
from the mountain which makes the southern wall of the
passage. An immense mass of earth and rock, on the side
of the mountain, was loosened from its resting place, and
began to slide towards the bottom. 4. In its course, it divi-
ded into three portions, each coming down, with amazing
velocity, into the road, and sweeping before it shrubs, trees,
and rocks, and ﬁlling up the road, beyond all possibility of
its being removed. With great labour, a pathway has been
made over these fallen masses, which admits the passage of
a carriage. 5. The place from which the slide, or slip, was
loosened, is directly in the rear of a small, but comfortable
dwelling-house, owned and occupied by a Mr. Willey, who
has taken advantage of a narrow, a very narrow intervale,——
where the bases of the two mountains seem to have parted
and receded, as if afraid of coming into contact,———to erect his
lone habitation: and, were there not a special Providence

A in the fall of a sparrow, and had not the ﬁnger of that Prove-

idence traced the direction of the sliding mass, neither he,
nor any soul of his family, would ever have told the"_tale.
6. They heard the noise, when it ﬁrst began to move, and
ran to the door. In terror and amazement, they beheld the
mountain in motion. But what can human ‘power effect in

such an emergency? Before they could think of retreating, _

or ascertain which way to escape, the danger was passed.
7. One portion of the awalanche crossed the road about ten
rods only from their habitation; the second, a few rods be-
yond that; and the third, and much the largest, portion took
a much more oblique direction. The whole area, now cov-
ered by the slide, is nearly an acre ; and the distance of its
present bed from its‘ former place on the side of the moun-
tain, and which it moved over in a few minutes, is from three
quarters of a mile to a mile. 8. There are many trees of
large size, that came down with such force as to shiver them
in pieces; and innumerable rocks, of many tons’ weight, any
one of which was sufficient to carry with it destruction to
any of the labours of man. The spot on the mountain, from

which the slip was loosened, is now a naked, white rock; i

NA TIONAL READER. 121

and its pathway downward is indicated by deep channels, or
furrows, grooved in the side of the mountain, and down one
of which pours a stream of water, suﬁicient to carry a com-
mon saw-mill.

9. From this place to the Notch, there is almost a continua.
ascent, generally gradual, but sometimes steep and sudden.
The narrow pathway proceeds along the stream, sometimes
crossing it, and shifting from the side of one mountain to the
other, as either furnishes a less precarious foot-hold for the
traveller tha.n its fellow. 10. Occasionally it winds up the
side of the steep to such a height, as to leave, on one hand or
the other, a gulf of unseen depth; for the foliage of the
trees and shruhsis impervious to the sight. 11. The Notch
itself is formed by a sudden projection of rock from the moun-
tain on the right or northerly side, rising perpendicularly to
a great height;-probably seventy or eighty feet,———and by a
large mass of rock on the left side, which has tumbled from
its ancient location, and taken a position within twentg/feet
of its opposite neighbour. 12. The length of the Notch is
not more than three or four rods. The moment it is passed,
the mountains seem to have vanished. A level meadow,
overgrown with long grass and wild ﬂowers, and spotted
with tufts of shrubbery, spreads itself before the astonished
eye, on the left, and a swamp, or thicket, on the right, con-
ceals the ridge of mountains which extend to the north : the
road separates this thieltet from the meadow. 13. Not far
from the Notch, on the right hand side of the read, several
springs issue from the rocks that compose the base of the
mountain, unite in the thicket, and form the Saco river. This
little stream runs across the road into the IIl8~'.t(l€)W, where it
almost loses itself in its meandering among the hogs, but again
collects its waters, and passes under the rock that 1".=1Z3.l{tZ‘S the
southerly wall of the Notch. 14. It is here invisible for sev-
eral rods, and its presence is indicated only by its noise, as
it rolls through its rugged tunnel. In wet seasons and fresh-
ets,probably aportion of the water passes vow" the fraginents
of rock, which are here wedged together, and form an arch,
or covering, for the natural bed of the stream.

L3. The sensations which affect the corporeal faculties, as
one views these stupendous creations of Omnipotence, are
absolutely afflicting and painful. I t’ you look at the sum-
mits of the mountains, when a cloud passes t.owar(_ls them, it
is impossible for the eye to distinguish, at such a height,
which is in mloltion, the mountain, or the cloud; and this

1253 INTRODUCTION TO T HE

deception of vision produces a dizziness, which few spectaa
tors have nerve enough to endure for many minutes. 16. If
the eye be ﬁxed on the crags and masses of rock, that project
from the sides of the mountains, the ﬂesh involuntarily quiv-
ers, and the limbs seem to be impelled to retreat from a scene
that threatens impendent destruction. If the thoughts which
crowd upon the intellectual faculties are less painful than
these sensations of flesh and blood, they are too sublime and
overwhelming to be described. 17. The frequent alterations
and great changes, that have manifestly taken place in these
majestic masses, since they wereeﬁrst piled together by the
hand of the Creator, are calculated to awaken “thoughts be-
yond the reaches of the soul.” 18. If the “ everlasting hills”
thus break in pieces, and shake the shaggy covering from
their sides, who will deny that "

This earthly globe, the creature of a day,

Though built by God’s right hand, shall pass away '!—-~

The sun himself, by gatherin clouds oppressed,

Shall, in his silent, dark paviﬁon rest;

His golden um shall break, and, useless, lie

Among the common ruins of the sky;

The stars rush headlong, in the wild commotion,
And bathe their glittering fore’heads in the ocean ’!

1!). Reflection needs not the authority of inspiration to

, war ‘ant a belief, that this anticipation is something more than

postical. History and philosophy teach its truth, or, atleast,
its probability. The melancholy imaginings which it ex-
cites are relieved by the conviction that the whole of God’s
creation is nothing less
Than a capacious ré'servoir of means,
Formed for his use, and ready at his will 3.

and that, if this globe should be resolved into chaos, it will
undergo a new organization, and be re-moulded into scenes
of beauty, and abodes of happiness. 20. Such may be the
order of nature, to be unfolded in a perpetual sé’riés of ma-
terial production and decay,—of creation and dissolution,—
a magniﬁcent procession of worlds and systems, in the march
of eternity. ‘

tains, from notes taken during a ramble among their crags,
cliffs, and glens. Our readers will, perhaps, remember that
we mentioned, in that sketch, a family, by the name of Wil-
ley, which resided about two miles below the Notch, and six
miles from any other human habitation. 2. There was an
appearance of rural neatness, simplicity and content, mani-
fested by all the members of‘ this family, thus secluded from
all the rest of the world, except the traveller whom curiosity
or «necessity might induce to call, that excited in us no ordi-
nary sensations of pleasure. If the situation of these appa-
rently innocent and happy beings produced, at that time, an
uncommon interest, the fate, which has since overwhelmed
them, has been no less powerful in exciting emotions of sym-
pathy. ,

3. Several days since, there were reports that an accident
had overtaken the family, and it was feared that they were
either drowned by the swelling of the waters, which rush
through the narrow deﬁle, or down the almost perpendicular
sides of the mountains, or buried beneath the falling earth
and rocks; but nothing certain was known of the fact, till the
receipt of the Portland Advertiser of Tuesday, which con-
tains the following account, and which puts an end -to all
hope that fears previously entertained were unfounded :—-—-

4. “ A gentleman from this town, who has recently return-
ed from Conway, has favoured us with some of the particu-
Fars of a disaster, near the Notch of the Wliite Hills, which
nappened last week. The afternoon had been rainy, and
the weather continued so till eleven o’clock in the evening,
when it cleared away. About the same hour, a great noise
was heard, at the distance of several miles, like the rushing
down of rocks and much water from the mountains. 5. The
next morning, the people, at Conway, could perceive that
some disaster, of no ordinary character, had happened, by
the appearance of the mountains on each side of the road.
On repairing to the spot, they found the house of Mr. Willey,
standing near the Notch, unhurt, but destitute of any of the
family. 6. It is supposed that. they left it in their fright, and
were instantly swept away, and buried under the rocks and
earth which were borne down by the freshet. This family
consisted of Mr. Willey, his wife, ﬁve children, and two
hired men, all of whom were suddenly swept from time to
eternity, by this lamentable disaster. 7. Had they remained
in the house, they would, probably, have been safe. Three
of those unfortunate persons have since been dug’ out from

_ 1:24 _lN'I‘RODUCTION TO THE

under the earth and rocks which were carried aiong with
them. .

8. “ All the out-buildings were destroyed, with the horses
in the stable. The oxen were saved. The road is ﬁlled up,
several miles, to that degree, that it is thought impracticable
to repair it, or make another. 9. It is supposed that a water-
spout gathered, and burst against the mountain, which pro-
duced so great a freshet, instantaneously, as to carry every
thing before it. Rocks, of several tons, were swept away.
The Saco river had risen at Fryeburg, the next morning, ten
feet.”

10. Thus is stricken from the face of the earth a group,
which the virtuous and the happy could not but admire,—-
which the rich and the proud might envy. No mortal eye
was permitted to witness and survive the agonies of the aw-
ful moment,-—-no mortal ear caught the expiring groan of the
sufferers. 11. The horrors of the catastrophe are imprinted
on the memory of no child of the earth. Yet were the very
hairs of their head all numbered; and who is there that
would not admire the kindness of that Providence, which
left no “ bruised reed” standing amidst a scene of bereave-
ment,—-—no parent to weep over the mangled and faded ﬂow-
er,—no infant bud cut from the parent stock, to wither and
die in the blast !

The I‘Ie7'mZ't.---PARNELL.

1. FAR in a wild, unknown to public view,

From youth to age, a reverend hermit grew;
The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell,
His food the fruits, his drink the crystal well:
Remote from man, with God he passed the. days; .
Prayer all his business, all his pleasure praise.

2. A life so sacred, such serene repose,

' Seemed heaven itself, till one suggestion rose,—-
Tliat vice should triumph, virtue vice obey ;
Thus sprung some doubt of P.rovidence’s sway.
His hopes no more a certain prospect boast,
And all the tenor of his soul 1S lost.

3. So, when a smooth expanse receives, impressed,
Calm nature’s image on its watery breast,
Down bend the banks, the trees depending grow,
And skies, beneath, with answering colours glow ;

But, if a stone the gentle sea divide,

Swift rufﬁing circles curl on every side ;

And glimmering fragments of a broken sun, ~
Banks, seas, and skies, in thick disorder run.

To clear this doubt, to know the world by sight,

To ﬁnd if books or swains report it right,

(For yet by swains alone the world he knew,
VVhose feet came wandering o’er the nightly dew,)
He quits his cell; the pilgrim-staff he bore,

And ﬁxed the scallop in his hat befoit ;

Then, with the rising sun, a journey went,

Sedate to think, and watching each event.

. The mom was wasted in the pathless grass,

And long and lonesome was the wild to pass;
But, when the southern sun had warmed the day,
A youth came posting o’er a crossing way ; _
His rairnent decent, his complexion fair,

And soft, in graceful ringlets, waved his hair.

. Then, near approaching, “ Father, hail!” he cried ;

And, “Hail, my son !” the reverend sire replied;
Words followed words, from question answer ﬂowed,
And talk of various kind deceived the road ;

Till, each with other, pleased, and loath to part,
VVhile in their age they dilfer, JOIII in heart.

Thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound ;

‘ Thus youthful ivy clasps an elm around.

N ow sunk the sun; the closing hour of day
Came onward, mantled o’er with sober gray;
Nature, in silence, bid the world repose,
VVhen, near the road, a stately palace rose.
There, by the moon, through ranks of trees they pass,
Whose verdure crowned their sloping sides with grass,
It chanced, the noble master of the dome
Still made his house the wandering stranger’s home ;
Yet, still, the kindness, from a thirst of praise,
Proved the vain ﬂourish of expensive ease.

. The pair arrive; the liveried servants wait;

Their lord receives them at the pompous gate ; ‘

A table groans with costly piles of food;

And all is more than hospitably good.

Then, led to rest, the day’s long toil they drown,

Deep sunk in sleep, and silk, and heaps of down.
At length ’tis morn; and, at the dawn of day,

Along the wide canals the zephyrs play;

Fresh o’er the gay parterres’ the breezes cree ,

And shake the neighbouring wood, to banish s eep.

Up rise the guests, obedient to the call ;

An early banquet decked the splendid hall ;

Rich, luscious wine a golden goblet graced,

‘Which the kind master forced the guests to taste.

INTRODUCTION TO THE

Then, pleased and thankful, from the porch they go,
And, but the landlord, none had cause of we;

His cup was vanished; for, in secret guise,

The younger guest purloined the glittering prize.

As one, who sees a serpent in his Way,

Glistening and basking in the summer ray,
Disordered, stops, to shun the danger near, ,
Then Walks with faintness on, and looks with fear,-—
So seemed the sire, When, far upon the road,

The shining spoil his wily partner showed.

He stopped with silence, walked with trembling heart,
And much he wished, but durst not ask, to part:
Murmuring, he lifts his eyes, and thinks it hard

That generous actions meet a base reward.

Wliﬂe thus they pass, the sun his glory shrouds ,

The changing skies hang out their sable clouds ;

A sound in air présaged approaching rain,

And beasts to covert scud across the plain.

. Warned by the signs, the wandering pair retreat,

To seek for shelter in a neighbouring seat:

’Twa! built with turrets, on a rising ground,

And strong, and large, and unimproved around;
Its owner’s temper, timorous and severe,

Unkind and griping, caused a desert there.

As near the miser’s heavy doors they drew,
Fierce rising gusts with sudden fury blew ;

The nimble lightning, mixed with showers, began,
And o’er their heads loud rolling thunder ran.
Here long they knock, but knock or call in vain,
Driven by the wind, and battered by the rain.

At length, some pity warmed the master’s breast;
(’Twas then his threshold ﬁrst received a guest ;)

- Slow-creaking, turns the door, with jealous care,

18.

19.

20.

And half he welcomes in the shivering pair.

One frugal fagot lights the naked walls,

And nature’s fervour through their limbs recalls ;
Bread, of the coarsest sort, with meager wine,
(Each hardly granted,) served them both to dine ;
And, when the tempest ﬁrst appeared to cease,
A ready warning bid them part in peace.

With still remark, the pondering hermit viewed,

In one so rich a life so poor and rude : t

And why should such (within himself he-’cried2
Lock the lost Wealth, a thousand want beside .
But what new ma.rks‘of wonder soon take place,
In every settling feature of his face,

When, from his vest, the young companion bore
That cup the generous landlord owned before,
And paid profusely, with the precious bowl,

The stinted kindness of this churlish soul!

But now the clouds in airy tumults fly;

The sun, emerging, opes an azure sky:

A fresher green- the smiling leaves display,
And, glittering as they tremble, cheer the day;
The weather courts them from the poor retreat,
And the glad master bolts the Wary gate.‘

VVHILE hence they walk, the pilgrim’s bosom wrought
With all the travail of uncertain thought.
His partner’s acts Without their cause appear ;
’Twas there a vice, and seemed a madness here :
Detesting that, and pitying this, he goes,
Lost and confounded with the various shows.

N ow night’s dim shades again involve the sky;
Again the Wanderers want a place to lie ;
Again they search, and ﬁnd a lodging nigh:
The soil improved around, the mansion neat,
And neither poorly low, nor idly great;
It seemed to speak its master’s turn of mind,-—-
Content, and, not for praise, but virtue, kind.

i

. Hither the walkers turn, with weary feet;

Then bless the mansion, and the master greet;
Their greeting fair, bestowed with modest guise,
The courteous master hears, and thus replies :-—-
“ Without a vain, without a grudging heart,

To him who gives us all, I yield a part;

From him you come, from him accept it here,----
A frank and sober, more than costly, cheer.”

. He spoke, and bade the Welcome tables spread;

Then talked of virtue till the time of bed,

When the grave household round his hall repair,

Warned by the bell, and close the hour with prayer.
At length the World, renewed by calm repose,

Was strong for toil; the dappled morn arose.

Before the pilgrims part, the younger crept

Near the closed cradle, where an infant slept,

And writhed his ‘neck ; the landlord’s little pride-

O strange return !—grew black, and gasped, and died.

. Horror of horrors! What! his only son!

How looked our hermit when the deed was done !
Not hell, though hell’s black jaws in sunder part,
And breathe blue ﬁre, could more assault his heart.
Confused, and struck with silence at the deed,
He ﬂies; but. trembling, fails to ﬂy with speed

LESSON LXXIV.
The Village Funerals»--H. Wane, JR.

1. IT was toward the close of a ﬁne day, in the beginning
of autumn, that I drew near a pleasant, retired village, on

tziis 1Z\’TP;0iTrt_?.£?’i‘1(3?a‘ T0 ’FHE

the banks of the river. The setting sun shone obliquely on
the pure landscape, which was already changing its green
leaves for the various  of autumn, and seenied to vie
in splendour with the glorious beauty of the Western sky.
2. The air was mild and still, and the interrupted cry of the
birds, that answered one another plaintively, from the ﬁelds,
rendered the hour yet more impressive. My mind took an
impression from the season; and, as I passed pensively and
slowly along, I was not sorry to find, on the edge of the vil-
lage, before I entered it, a graveyard, by the way-side.

5’. I had been musing on the changes of nature, the close
of the day and of the year; end I was just in a suitable
frame to contemplate the end of man. I a-lighted, and tied
my horse, and went in to read the epitaphs, and learn how
short a thing is life, and reflect on the worthlessn-ess of post-'-
humous praise. 4.. I found a new—made grave, just opened,

and waiting for its tenant. My thoughts ﬁxed themselves ,

upon it. F01‘Wl’}GI}3 can this be? And I stood revolving
the possible answers to this question, until approaching steps
disturbed me, and a procession entered the yard.

5. I stepped aside to observe it. First came tvzelve young
girls, in white dresses, and with wreaths of evergreen in their
hands. Then followed an old men, who proved to be the
‘minister of the place, and who ininjiediately preceded the
bier, which was borne by four young men. 6. Mourners,
and a numerous train, succeeded. The procession moved
on to the grave; they gathered close around it; those that
bare the body stood still, and placed it on the ground. Rev-
erently the pall was tal~:en off’, and, in sad silence, the coffin
descended to its place. 7. The girls in white approached,‘
and cast their wreaths upon it, and then lifted their voices
in a low and mournful song, which gradually grew ﬁrmer,
and swelled louder, till it closed in a full peal of triumph.

8. I never had witnessed such a scene before, and every

thing was done so simply, so quietly, so naturally, that it touch-

ed me to the heart. I perceived that others were affected also;
and it was not without evident emotion, that the venerable
pastor uncovered his white locks to the wind, and lifted his
trernulous voice. 9. “ It is well,” said he, “ it is well, it is
ﬁtting, that the fair and innocent should go to their home
upon the wings of song, and that Christians should thus bid
adieu to those whom they loved. ‘While their spirits are

‘welcomed by the hymns of angels above, it is right that our

voices below should join the consoling and enrapturing strain.

  LESSON Lxxvj.  
Execution of Captain Natlzavz’ H. ADAMS,

  retreat of General>W'ashington left the British‘ i-n
complete possession of I Long I_slan'd. What would be?-their
future operations, remained uncertain, To gain exact knowl-
edge of their situation, theirfstrength, and future movements,
was of high importance. . T.2.“'?~For this purpose, General VVash-
ington applied to Colonel Knowlton, who commanded a re-

“giment of light infantry, which formed the Vaniof the Ameri-

can army,iand desired to adopt somemode of gaining
the necessary information. Colonel KnoWlton-',communica-
ted this request to Nathan Hale, of Connecticut, who was
then a captain in his ‘regiment.’ 3. This young oﬂicer, ani-
mated by a sense of duty, and considering that an opportunity
presented itself, by which he might be useful to his country,
at once ‘offered himself a volunteer for this hazardousiservice.
He passed in disguise to Long Island, examined every part

of the British. army, and obtained the best possible informa-

tion" respecting their position and future operations.

4; In his attemptito return, he -was apprehended, carried.

before Sir William Howe, and the proof. of_,his object was-"so
clear, that he franltly-"acknowledged who he was, and what

_ were his v_,iews_,,, c-Sir VVilliam Howe at once gave an order

to the pr6ii7ost marshal to executehim the next morning.

xv‘ -

134 INTRODUCTION TO THE

5. The order was accordingly executed in a most unfeel-Eng
manner, and by as great a savage as ever disgraced humanity.
A clergyman, whose attendance he desired, was refused him;
a Bible, for a moment’s devotion, was not procured, though
he requested it. 6. Letters, which, on the morning of his
execution, he wrote to his mother, and other friends, were de-
stroyed; and this very extraordinary reason was given by the
provost marshal, “that the rebels should not know that they
had a man in their army, who could die with so much
ﬁrmness.”

7’. Unknown to all around him, wi*hout a single friend to
offer him the least consolation, thus fell as amiable and as
worthy a youngman as America could boast, with this as his
dying observation, that he only lamented he had but one
life to lose for his country. 8. How superior to the dying
words of Andre! Though the manner of his execution will
ever be abhorred by every friend to humanity and religion,
yet there cannot be a question but that the sentence was
conformable to the rules of war, and the practice of nations
in similar cases.

9. It is, however, a justice due to the character of Captain
Hale, to observe, that his motives for engaging in this service
were entirely different from those which generally inﬂuence
others in similar circumstances. Neither expectation of pro-
motion, nor pecuniary reward, induced him to this attempt.
10. A sense of duty, a hope that he might, in this way, be
useful to his country, and an opinion which he had adopted,
that every kind of service, necessary to the public good, be-
came honourable by being necessary, were the great motives
which induced him to engage in an enterprise, by which his
connexions lost a most amiable friend, and his country one

"of its most promising supporters.

11. The fate of this unfortunate young man excites the
most interesting reflections. To see such a character, in the
ﬂower of youth, cheerfully treading in the most hazardous
paths, inﬂuenced by the purest intentions, and, only emulous
to do good to his country, without the imputation of a crime,
fall a victim to policy, must have been wounding to the feel-,
ings even of his enemies.

12. Should a comparison be drawn between Major Andre
and Captain Hale, injustice would be done to the latter,
should he not be placed on an equal ground with the former.
Whilst almost every historian of the American revolution
has celebrated the virtues, and lamented the fate, of ;A,nd_re,,

NATIONAL READER. .135

Hale has remained unnoticed, and it  scarcely known that
such a character ever existed.

13. To the memory of Andre his country has erected the
most magniﬁcent monuments, and bestowed on his family
the highest honours and most liberal rewards. To the mem-
ory of Hale not a stone has been erected, and the traveller
asks in vain for the place of his long sleep.

LESSON LXXVI.
jlfurclereﬂs Creek.

1. LITTLE more than a century ago, the beautiful region
watered by this stream’7"‘ was possessed by a small tribe of
Indians, which has long since become extinct, or incorpo-
rated with some other savage nation of the west. Three’ or
four hundred yards from where the stream discharges itself
into the Hudson, a white family, of the name of Stacy, had
established itself in a log house, by tacit permission of the
tribe, to whom Stacy had made himself useful by his skill
in a variety of little arts highly estimated by the savages.
2. In particular, a friendship subsisted between him and an
old Indian, called Na6’man, who often came to his house, and
partook of his hospitality. The Indians never forgive inju-
ries, nor forget benefits. The family consisted of Stacy, his
wife, and two children, a boy and a girl, the former five, the
latter three, years old.

3. One day, Nao’man came to Stacy’s log hut, in his ab-
sence, lighted his pipe, and sat down. He looked very seriv
ous, sometimes sighed deeply, but said not a word. Stacy's
wife asked him what was the matter_.—--if ne was sick. He
shook his head, sighed, but said nothing, and soon went
away. 4. The next day, he came again, and behaved in the
same manner. Stacy’s wife began to think strange of this,

and related it to her nnsband, who advised her to urge the

old man to an explanation. the next time he came. Accord-
ingly, when he repeated his visit, the day after, she was more
iniportunate than usuai. 5. At last, the old Indian said, “ I
am a red man, and the pale faces are our enemies: why

“ should I speak ’."’——“ But my husband and I are your friends;

you have eaten salt with us a thousand times, and my chil-
dren have sat on your knees as often. If you have any thing

on your mind,‘telI it me.”--6. “ It will cost me my life, if it
is known, and the white-faced women are not good at keep-
ing secrets,” replied N a6’man.——“ Try me, and see.”-.-“ Will
you swear, by your Great Spirit, that you will tell none but
your husband ?”——“ I have none else to tell.”——“ But will you
swear ?”--—“ I do swear, by our Great Spirit, I will tell none
but my husband.”——“ Not if my tribe should kill you for not
telling’?”———“ Not if your tribe should kill me for not telling.”

7. Na6’man then proceeded to tell her, that, owing to some
encroachments of the white people below the mountains, his
tribe had become irritated, and were resolved, that night, to
massacre all the white settlers within their reach; that she
must send for her husband, inform him of the danger, and,
as secretly and speedily as possible, take their canoe, and
paddle with all haste over the river to Fishkill for safety.-—
“ Be quick, and do nothing that may excite suspicion,” said
Na6’man, as he departed. 8. The good wife sought her
husband, who was down on the river ﬁshing, told him the
story, and, as no time was to be lost, they. proceeded to their
boat, which was unluckily ﬁlled with water. It took some
time to clear it out, and, meanwhile, Stacy recollected his
gun, which had been left behind. He proceeded to the
house, and returned with it. All this took up considerable
time, and precious time it proved to this poor family. 9. The
daily visits of old 'Na6’man, and his more than ordinary grav-
ity, had excited suspicion insorne of the-tribe, who had, a(:—
cordingly, paid particular attention to the movements of Stacy.
One of the young Indians, who had been kept on the watch.
seeing the whole family aboutto take to the boat, ran to the
little Indian village, about a mile off, and gave the alarm.
10. Five Indians collected, ran down to the river, where
their canoes were moored, jumped in, and paddled after filter-
cy, who, by this time, had got some distance out into the
stream. V They gained on him so fast, that twice he dropped
his paddle, and took up his gun. I]. But his wife prevented
his shooting, by telling him that, if he ﬁred, and they were
afterwards overtaken, they would meet with no mercy from
the Indians. He accordingly refrained, and plied his paddle
till the sweat rolled in big drops down his forehead. All
would not do; they were overtaken within a hundred yards
from the shore, and carried back, with shouts of yeliing tri-
umph. I

12. When they got ashore, the Indians set ﬁre to Stacy’s
house, and dragged himself. his wife and children to their

them, assembled to deliberate on the ‘ affair. 13. The chief

Tlzefacetious Story of John Gz'€pin.--—COWPER.

 

1. JOHN iGII.PIN was a citizen of credit and renown;
A train—band captain, eke, was he, of famous London town.
John Gilpin’s spouse said to her dear, “Though wedded we
have been ,
These twice ten tedious years, yet we no holyday have seen.

 2. To-morrow is our Wedding-day, and we shall then repair

‘ Unto the Bell at Edmonton, all in a chaise and pair.
My sister and my sister’s child, myself and children three,
VVill fill the chaise ; so you must ride on horseback after we.”

3. John Gilpin said, “I do admire, of woman-kind, but one,
And you are she, my dearest dear; therefore it shall be done.
I am a linen~draper bold, as all the world doth know ;
And my_good«frien»d, Tom Callender, will lend his horse to go.”

4. Quoth-Mrs. Gilpin, “ That’s well said; and, for that wine is
dear
We will be furnished with our own, which is both bright and
clear.”
f John Gilpin kissed his loving Wife; o’erjoyed was he to ﬁnd,
That, though on pleasure she was bent, she had a frugal mind.

5. The morning . came, the chaise was brought, but yet was not
allowed
To drive up to the door, lest all shouldsay that she was proud.
So three doors off the chaise was stayed, where they did all
get in — _
Six precious s’ouls,—-and all agog to dash through thick and
thin! V

Smack went the whip, round went the wheels ; were never
folks so glad;
The stones did rattle underneath, as if Cheapside were mad.
John Gilpin, at his horse’s side, seized fast the ﬂowing mane,
And up he got, in haste to ride, but soon came down again '

Then, over all, that he might be equipped from top to toe,

But, ﬁnding, soon, a smoother road beneath his well-shod feet,
The snorting beast began to trot, which galled him in his seat.
“So! fair and softly!” John he cried; but John he cried in
vain; .
The trot became a gallop soon, in spite of curb and rein.

So, stooping down, as needs he must, who cannot sit upright,

He grasped the mane with both his hands, and, eke, with all

his might. .
Away went Gilpin, neck or naught ; away went hat and wig;
He little dreamed, when he set out, of running such a rig.

His horse, who never had, before, been handled in thisikind,
Affrighted fled; and, as he flew, left all the world behind.

And still, as fast as he drew near, ’twas wonderful to view,
How in a trice the turnpike men thelr gates wide open threw.

. And now, as he went bowing down his reeking head full low,

The bottles twain, behind his back, were shattered at a blow.

Down ran the wine 1nto the road, most piteous to be seen,

VVh1ch rgade hls horse’s ﬂanks to smoke, as they had bested
een.

But still he‘ seemed to carry weight, with leather girdle

braced ; i V,
For all might see the bottle necks still dangling at his waist.
Thus, all through merry Islington, these garnbols he did play,
And till he came unto the Wash of Edmonton so gay.

. And there he threw the Wash about on both sides of the way,

Just like unto a trundling-mop, or a wild goose at play.
At Edmonton, his loving wife, from the balcony, spied
Hertender husband‘, wondering much to see how he did ride.

“Stop, stop, John Gilpin! here’s the house 1” they all at once
did cry ' 

“ The dinner waits, and we are tired!” Said ,,Qilpin, “So

. But yet his horse was not a whit inclined to tarry there ;

For? hisowner had a house, full ten miles oﬁ’, at Ware.

So, an arrow, swift he ﬂew, shot by an archer strong;
So did he ﬂy—-which brings me to the middle of my song.
Away went Gilpin, out of breath, and sore against his will,

. Till at his friend’s, Tom,Ca1lender’s, his horse at last stood still.

Tom Callender, surprised to see his friend in such a trim,
Laid down hispipe, ﬂew to the gate, and thus accosted him :--
“ VVhat« njews? .What news ?, Your tidings tell ! Make haste,
and tellme all !

Say, why bare-headed are you come? or why you come
i at all?”

Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit, and loved a tunely joke ;

And thus unto Tom Callender, in merry strains, he spoke :—-~—

“I came because your horse would come ; "and, if I well
forebode,

My hat and wig will soon be here ; they are upon the road 3”

Said John, “ It is my wedding day; and folks would gape

If wife should dine at Edmonton, and I should dine at Ware.”

So, turning to his horse, he said, “ I am in haste to dine :

’Twas for your pleasure you came here ; you shall go back for

For while he spake, a braying ass did sing most loud and

Now talked of this, and then of that,
Discoursed a while, ’mongst other matter,
Of the chameleon’s form and nature.

“ A stranger animal,” cries one,
“ Sure never lived beneath the sun!
A lizard’s body, lean and long,
A ﬁsh’s head, a serpent’s tongue,
Its foot with triple claw disjoined,
And what a length of tail behind!
How slow its pace? and then its huc——
Who ever saw so ﬁne a blue!”

“ Hold there!” the other quick replies :
“ ’Tis green; I saw it with these eyes,
As late, with open mouth, it lay,
And warmed it in the sunny ray :
Stretched atits ease, the beast I viewed,
And saw it eat the air for food.”

“ I’ve seen it, sir, as well as you,

And must again aﬂirm it blue.

At leisure I the beast surveyed.

Extended in the cooling shade.”

“ ’Tis green, ’tis green, sir, I assure ye.”--

“Green 1” cries the other in a fury ;

“ VVhy, sir, d’ye think I’ve lost my eyes T”

“ ’Twere no great loss,” the friend replies;

“ For, if they always serve you thus,

You’ll ﬁnd them but oflittle use.”

So high, at last, the contest rose,

From words they almost came to blows;
When,'1uckily, came by a third,

To whom the question they referred,

And begged he’d tell them, if he knew,
Whether the thing was green or blue.

“ Sirs,” cries the umpire, “ cease your pother:

The creature’s—-neither one nor t’other.

I caught the animal last night,

And viewed it o’er by candle-light;

I marked it well-—’twas black as jet.

You stare; but, sirs, I’ve got it yet,

And can produce it.”—-—-9. “ Pray, sir, do;

I’ll lay my life the thing is blue.”--

“ And I’ll be sworn, that, when you’ve seen
The reptile, you’l1 pronounce it green.——-

“ ‘Well, then, at once to end the doubt,”

Replies the man, “ I’ll turn him out;

And, when before your eyes I’ve set him,

If you don’t find him black, I’ll eat him.”

He said; then full before their sight
Produced the beast——-and, lo !——’twas white.

Both stared; the man looked wondrous wise z--—--

‘‘ My children,” the chameleon cries,-—— '
(Then first the creature found a tongue,)~—-
“ You all are right, and all are wrong.

Think others see, as well as you ;

Nor wonder if you ﬁnd that none

Prefers your eye-sight to his own.”

The Righteous 2267362‘f07‘sct]cert.—+-ANONY1vIt)US.

1. IT was Saturday night, and the widow of the pine cot-
tage sat by her blazing fagots with five tattered children at
her side, endeavouring, by listening to the artlessnessof their
juvenile prattle, to dissipate the heavy gloom that pressed
upon her mind. For a year, her own feeble hands had pro-
vided for her helpless family; for she had no supporter, she

thought of no friend, in all the wide, unfriendly world around.“ 

2. But that mysterious ilrovidence, the wisdom of whose
ways is above human comprehension, had visited her with
wasting sickness, and her little means had become exhausted.
It was now, too, mid-winter, and the snow lay heavy and
deep throughout all the surrounding forests, while storms
still seemed gathering in the heavens, and the driving wind
roared amidst the bending pines, and rocked her puny
mansion. ‘

3. The last herrincr smoked upon the coals before her; it
was the only article of, food she possessed; and no wonder
her forlorn, desolate state brought up in her lone bosom all
the anxieties of a mother‘, when she looked upon her chil-
dren; and no Wonder, forlorn as she was, if she suﬂered the
heart-swellings of despair to rise,even though she knew that
He, whose promise. is to the widow. and to the orphan, cannot
forget his word. 4. Many years before, her eldest son went
from his forest home, to try his fortune on the high seas;
since which, she had heard no note or tidings from him;
and, in the latter time, Providence had, by the hand of death,
deprived her of the companion and staff of her world] y pil-
grimage, in the person of her husband. Yet,‘to this hour,
she had been upborne; she had not only been able to pro-
vide for her‘ little flock, but had even an opportunity of

_ ministering to the wants of the miserable and the destitute.

5. The indolent may well bear with poverty, while the

. ability to gain sustenance remains. The individual, who has

only his own wants to supply, may suffer with, fortitude the

.winter of want; his affections are not wounded, his heart is

not wrung,’ The most desolate, in poptilous cities, may
hope; for Charity has not quite closed her hand and heart,
and shut her ‘eyes on misery. But the industrious mother of

. helpless and dependingichildren, far from‘ the reach of hu-

man charity, has none of these, to console her. 6:. Such a

LESSON LXXX. H
Danger of robbing Birds’ Nests.——A. WrLsoN

1. TIIE red-headed Woodpecker is, properly speaking, a
bird of passage; thdugh, even in the Eastern States, indi-
viduals are found, during moderate winters, as well as in the
states of:;l\,le\v York and Pennsylvania. In Carolina, they are
someu*lfat'imore numerous during that season; though there
are not one tenth as imany, even there, as are found in sum
mer.  p .  

2. They make their appearance, in Pennsylvania, about the
ﬁrst of May, and leave it about the middle of October. They
inhabit from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico,.and are also found
on the Western coast of North America. ii 3. About the mid-
dle of May’, they begin to construct their nests, which they
form in the body or large limbs of trees, taking in no materials,
but smoothing the hole within to the proper shape and size.
The female lays six_ eggs, of a pure white, and the young
make their appearance abeut the twentieth of June.

4. Notwithstanding the care which this bird, in common
with the rest of its kind, takes, to place its young beyond
the reach of""enemies, within the hollows of trees; yet there

is one», deadly foe, against whose depredations neither the

height of the tree, nor the depth of the cavity, is the least
security. 5. This is the black snake, that frequently glides
up the trunk of the tree, and, like a skulking savage, enters
the Woodpecker’s peaceful apartment, devours the eggs, or
helpless young,‘in spite of the cries and ﬂutterings of the
parents; and, if the place be large enough, coils himself up
in the spot they occupied, where hewill sometimesrremain

his neck to reach the woodpecker’s hole, at the triumphant

moment. when he thinks the nestlings his own, and strips
his arm, thrusting it down into the cavity, and grasping what
he conceives to be the callow young, starts with horror at
the sight of a hideous snake, and almost drops from his giddy
pinnacle, retreating down the tree with terror and precipita-
tion. 7. Several adventures of this kind have come to my
knowledge ; and one of them was attended with serious con-
sequences, where both the robbers-—the snake and the boy
--—fell to the ground; and a broken thigh, and a long con-
ﬁnement, cured the young adventurer completely of his am-
bition for robbing woodpeckers’ nests.

LESSON LXXXI. '
Flight of the Bald Eagle.——THE SAME.

1. THE ﬂight of the bald eagle, when taken into consider

' ation with the ardour and energy of his character, is noble

and interesting. Sometimes the human eye can just discern
hirn, like a minute speck, moving in slow curvatures, along

the face of the‘ heavens, as if reconnoitering the earth at that

immense distance. 2. Sometimes he glides along, in a di-
rect, horizontal line, at a vast. height, with expanded and
unmoving wings, till he gradually disappears in the distant
blue ether. Seen gliding, in easy circles, over the high shores
and mountainous cliffs, that tower above the Hudson and the
Susquehanna, he attracts the eye of the intelligent voyager,
and adds great interest to the scenery.

3. At the great cataract of Niag’ara, there rises from the
gulf into which the fall of the Horse—shoe descends, a stu-
pendous column of smoke, or spra , reaching to the heavens,
and moving off in large black clouds, according to the direc-
tion of the wind, and forming a very striking and majestic ap-
pearance. 4. The‘ eagles arehere seen sailing about, some-
times losing themselves in this thick column, and again re-

appearing in another place, with such ease and elegance of

motion, as renders the whole truly sublime.

5. High o’er the watery uproar, silent, seen

Sailing sedate in majesty serene, v

New, midst the pillared spray sublimely lost,
And now, emerging, down the rapids tossed,
Glides the bald eagle, gazing, calm and slow,
Q’er all the horrors of the‘ scene be-low ;

Dress of an Indian Beau.-—T. FLINT.

1. A YOUNG Indian warrior is, notoriously, the most thor-
ough-going bean in the world. Broadway and Bond Street
furnish no subjects, that will spend so much time, or endure
as much crimping and conﬁnement, to appear in full dress.

2. We think that we have observed such a character, con-
stantly employed with his paints and his pocket-glass, for
three full hours, laying on his paints, arranging his tresses, and
contemplating, with visible satisfaction, from time to time,
the progress of his attractions. 3. The chiefs and warriors,
in full dress, have one, two, or three clasps of silver about
their arms; generally jewels in their ears, and often in their
nose ; and nothing is more common than to see a thin, cir-
cular piece of silver, of the size of a dollar, hanging from
their nose, a little below their upper lip. 4. Painted porcu-
pines’ quills are twirled in their hair, and tails of animals
hang from it behind. A necklace of bears’ or alligators’
teeth, or claws of the bald eagle, or common red beads,
or, wanting these, a kind of rosary of red thorn-berries,
hangs about the neck. From the knees to the feet, the
legs are ornamented with great numbers of little perfora-
ted, cylindrical pieces of silver or brass, that tinkle, as the
person walks. 5. If, to all this, he add an American hat,
and a soldier’s coat of blue, faced with red, over the custom-
ary calico shirt, he steps ﬁrmly on the ground, to give his
tinklers a simultaneous noise, and, apparently, considers his
person with as much complacency as a human bosom can
feel. This, is a very curtailed View of an Indian beau, but

faithful, as far as it goes, to the description of almost every

young Indian at a great public dance.

the ﬁrst French iwriters, or even the fall of ﬁfty feet, assigned
to them by moremodern authorities, the real fall of the Mis-
sissippi, here, is between sixteen and seventeen feet of per-
pendicular descent. Though it has not the slightest, claim
to compare with Niagara in ‘grandeur, it furnishes an impres-
sive and beautiful spectacle in the loneliness of the desert. _
2. The adjoining scenery is of the ‘most striking and ro-
mantic character‘; and, while the traveller listens to the sol-
emn roar of the falls, as it sinks into feeble echoes inthe
forests, a thrilling story is ‘told him of the love and despair
of a young Dacéta Indian woman,‘ who, goaded‘ by jealousy

towards her husband, that had taken another wife, placed

her young" children in a canoe, and, chantingthe remembran-
ces of loveland broken vows, precipitated herself and her
infants down the falls. _ L A ~—

that she is ‘seen, on sunny mornings, carrying her, babes, in

, 4. The hér’6ine had, that very morning, learned how the
double trigger of a riﬂe was set. Fortunately, the children
were not awakened by the ﬁring; and she took care not to
awaken them. She shut the door, and barred it with bench-
es and tables, and took down the well-charged rifle of her
husband. 5. She placed herself directly opposite to t.he
opening which would be made by forcing the door. Her
husband came not, and she was but too well aware that he
was slain. She was alone, in the darkness. The yelling
savages were without, pressing upon the house. She took
counsel from her own magnanimity, heightened by affection
for her children, that were sleeping, unconsciously, around
her. 6. The Indians, pushing with great violence, gradu-
ally opened the door suﬂiciently wide to attempt an entrance.
The body of one was thrust into the opening, and just ﬁlled
it. He was struggling for admittance. Two or three more,
directly behind him,—were propelling him forward. 7. She
set the trigger of the riﬂe, put the muzzle near the body of
the foremost, and in such a direction that the ball, after pass-
‘ing through his body, would penetrate those behind. She
ﬁred. The ﬁrst Indian tell. The next one uttered the scream
of mortal agony. 8. This intrepid woman saw the policy of
profound silence. She observed it. The Indians, in conse-
quence, were led to believe that armed men were in the
house. They withdrew from the house, took three horses
from the stable, and set it on ﬁre. It was afterwards ascer-
tained, that this high-minded widow had saved herself and
her children from the attack. of twenty-ﬁve assailants!

“ you ought not to have placed so much conﬁdence in a man,
of whose ﬁdelity you were not sulhciently assured. It will
be ditlicult to compel this cheat to restore a deposit which
he received when no witnesses were present. Go to him
again,” added he, “ address him in a friendly manner, with-
out informing him that I am acquainted with the affair, and
return to me to-rnorrow at this hour.”

3. The merchant obeyed; but, instead ofgetting his men-
ey, he received only abuse. ‘While the debtor and creditor
were disputing, a slave arrived from the cadi, who invited
the dervis to pay a visit to his master. The dervis accept-
ed the invitn.tion. 4. He was introduced into a grand apart-
ment, received with friendship, and treated with the same
respect as if he had been a man of the most distinguished
rank. The cadi discoursed with him upon diﬁferent subjects,
among which he occasionally introduced, as an opportunity
presented, the highest encomiums on the Wisdom and knowl-
edge of the dervis. 5. Wilden he thought he had gained
his conﬁdence by praises and ﬂattery, he informed him that
he had sent for him in order to give him the most convincing
proof of his respect and esteem. “ An affair of the greatest
in’1portan$ce,” says: he, “obliges me to be absent for  few
months. I cannot trust my slaves, and I am desirous of put-
tingmy treasures into the hands of a man, who, like you,
enjoys the most unspotted reputation. 6. If you can take
the charge of them, without impeding your own occupations,
I shall send you, to-morrow night, my most valuable eﬁiectsg
but, as this affair requires great secrecy, I shall order the

. faithfulest of my slaves to deliver them to you, as a present

which I make you.’’ , -

7. At these words, an agreeable smile was diffused over
the countenance of the treacherous dervis. He madea thou-
sand reverences to the cadi ; thanked him for the conﬁdence
which he .r,e,posed,in him; swore, in the strongest terms, that
he would pr-e.ser,vei his treasures as the apple of his eye; and

retired, hugging himself with joy at the thoughts of being,
. able to overreachthe’ judge. '

8. Next morning, the merchant returned to the cadi, and
informed him of the obstinacy of the dervis. “Go back,”
said the judge, “ and, if he persist in his refusal, threaten
that you will complain to me. I think you will not have
occasion to repeat your men’ace.”

9. The merchant immediately hastened to the house of
his debtor, and no sooner had he mentioned the name of the
cadi, than the dervis, who was afraid of losing the treasure
that was about to be intrusted to his care, restored the purse,
and said, smiling, “ My dear friend, why should you trouble
the cadi’! Your money was perfectly secure in my hands;
my refusal was only a piece of pleasantry. I was desirous
of seeing how you would bear disappointment" 10. The
merchant, however, was prudent enough not to believe what
he had heard, and returned to the cadi, to thank him for the
generous assistance which he had given him.

11. Night approached, and the dervis prepared to receive
the expected treasure; but the night passed, and no slaves
appeared. As soon as it was morning, the dervis repaired
to the judge’s house. “ I am come to know, Mr. Cadi,”
said he, “why you have not sent your slaves, according to
promise?”

12. “ Because I have learned from a merchant,” said the
judge, “ that thou art. a perﬁdious Wretch, whom justice will
punish as thou deservest, if a second complaint of the same
nature is brought against thee.” The dervis, struck with
this reproof, made a profound reverence, and retired with
precipitation, without offering a single word in his own vin-
dication. .

LESSON XC.
The Grizzly Bcctr.———.i. D. GODMAN.

1. THIS bear, justly considered as the most dreadful and
dangerous of North American quadrupeds, is the despotic
and sanguinary monarch of the wilds over which he ranges.
Gigantic in size, and terriﬁc in aspect, he unites to a fig-
rociously blood-thirsty disposition ‘a surpassing strength of
limb, which gives him undisputed supremacy over every
other quadruped tenant of the wilderness, and causes man
himself to trembleat his approach, though possessed of de-

fensive weapons unknown to any but the human race. 2; To

156 INTRODUCTION TO THE

the Indians, the very name of the grizzly bear is dreadful, and
the killing of one is esteemed equal toa great victory. The
white hunters are almost always willing to avoid an encoun-
ter with so powerful an adversary, and seldom, or never,
wantonly provoke his anger.

3. This formidable bear,‘ unhesitatingly, pursues and at-
tacks men or animals, when excited by hunger or passion,
and slaughters, indiscriminately, every creature whose speed
or artiﬁce is not sufiicient to place him beyond his reach.
The bison, whose size and imposing appearance might seem
to be a suflicient protection, does not always elude his grasp,
as the grizzly bear is strong enough to overpower this ani-
mal, and drag its carcass to a convenient place, to be depos-
ited, and devoured at leisure. if * * if * *"‘ * * 3“

4. This hear, at present, inhabits the country adjacent to
the eastern side of th_e Rocky Mountains, where it frequents
the plains, or resides in the copses of wood, which skirt along
the margin of water-courses. There is some reason to be-
lieve, that the grizzly bear once inhabited the Atlantic regions
of the United States, if We may be allowed to form any in-
ference from traditions existing among the..Delaware Indians,
relative to the big naked bear, which was formerly found on

the banks of the Hudson. The venerable Heckewelder in--

forms us, that Indian mothers used to frighten their children
into quietness, byspeaking to them of this animal. *3 * *

5. Two cubs of the grizzly bear were, some time since,
kept alive in the menageriel of Peale’s (now the Philadel-
phia) Museum. When first received, they were quite small,
but speedily gave indications of that ferocity, for which this
species is so remairkable. As they increased in size, they
became exceedingly dang_erous, seizing and tearing to pieces
every animal .they could lay hold of, and expressing extreme
eagerness to get at those accideritally brought within sight
of their cage, by grasping tvhfeiron bars with their paws, and
shaking them Violently, to the great terror ofspectators, who
felt insecure while witnessing such displays of their strength.
6. In one instance, an unfortunate monkey was walking
over the top of their cage, when the end of the chain, which
hung fromyghis waist, dropped through within reach of the
bears: theylimmediately seized it, dragged the screaming
animal through the narrow aperture, tore him limb from
limb, and devoured his mangled carcass almost instantane-

ously. 7. .At another time, a small monkey thrust his arm
through an opening in the bear-cage, to reach after some
object: one of them immediately seized him, and, with a
sudden jerk, tore the whole arm and shoulder-blade from
the body, and devoured it before any one could interfere.
8. They were still cubs, and very little more than half grown,
when their ferocity became so alarming, as to excite contin
ual apprehension, lest they should escape; and they were
killed, in order to prevent such an event. ”* * 5" 3‘ *

9. The grizzly bear is remarkably tenacious of life, and,
on many occasions, numerous riﬂe-balls have been ﬁred into
the body of an individual, without much apparent injury.
Instances are related by the travellers, who have explored
the countries in the vicinity of the Rocky Mountains, of from
ten to fourteen balls having been discharged into the body
of one of these bears, before it expired. In conﬁrmation of
these statements, we shall here introduce some sketches
from narratives given in the journals, of Lewis and Clark,
and Long’s Expedition to the Rocky Mountains. V,

10. One evening, the men in the hindmost of one of Lewis
and Clark’s canoes, perceived one of these bears lying in the
open ground, about three hundred paces from the river, and
six of them, who were all good hunters, went to attack him.
Concealing themselves by a small eminence, they were able
to approach within forty paces unperceived. Four of the
hunters now ﬁred, and each lodged a ball in his body, two
of which passed directly through the lungs. 11. The bear
sprang‘ up, and ran, furiously, withopen mouth, ‘upon them.
Two of the hunters, who had revservedaaiheir ﬁre, gave him
two additional wounds, and one, breaking h.is,shoulder-blade,
somewhat retarded his motions. Before they could again
load their guns, he came so close upon them, that they were
obliged to run towards the river, and, before they had gain-
ed it, the bear had almost overtaken them. 12. Two men
jumped into the canoe; the other four separated’, and, con-
cealing themselves among the willows, ﬁred as fast as_ they
could load their pieces. ‘ Several times the bear was struck,
but each shot seemed only to direct his fury towards the
hunter. At last, he pursued thernlso closely, that they threw
aside their guns and pouches, and jumped from a perpendic—
ular...bank, twenty feet high, into the river. 13. The bear
sprang after them, and was very near the hindmost man,

_ when one of the hunters, on the shore, shot him through the

head, and, ﬁnally, killed him. ;When they dragged him on

shore, they found that eight balls had passed through his
body in differeiit directions.

14. On another occasion, the same enterprising travellers
met with the largest hear, of this species, they had ever
seen. Wlien they ﬁred, he did not attempt to attack, but
ﬂed with a tremendous rear; and such was his tenacity of
life, that, although five balls had passed through the lungs,
and ﬁve other wounds were inﬂicted, he swam more than
half across the river, to a sand bar, and survived more than
twenty minutes. 15. This individual weighed ﬁve or six
hundred pounds, at least; and measured eight feet seven
inches and a half, from the nose to the extremity of the hind
feet; ﬁve feet ten inches and a half, around the breast; three

, feet eleven inches, around the middle of the fore-leg; and

his claws were four inches and three-eighths long.
16. In fact, the chance of killing the grizzly bear by a

 single shot, is very small, unless the ball penetrates the
brain, or passes through the heart. This is very dillicult to

effect, since the form of the skull, and the strong muscles on
the side of the head, protect the brain from every injury, ex-
cept. one from a very truly aimed shot; and the thick coat
of hair, the strong muscles and ribs, make it nearly as diffi-
cult to lodge a ball fairly in the heart.

17. Governor Clinton, in the notes to his discourse deliv-
ered before the Literary and Philosophical Society of New
York, says, that Dixon, an Indian trader, told ‘a friend of
his, thatthis animal had been seen fourteen feet long; that,
notwithstanding its ferocity, it had been, occasionally, do-
mesticated; and that an Indian, belonging to a tribe on the
head waters of the Mississippi, had one in a reclaimed state,
which he, sportively, directed to go into a canoe belonging to
another tribe of Indians, then returning from a visit : the bear
obeyed, and was struck by an Indian. As the animal was con-
sidered one of the fainily, was deemed an insult, resent-
ed acc.ordin.<1l}’, and produced'"a war between these nations.”

18. Mr. Jolin Doughertyl, a very experienced and respect-
able hunter, who accompanied Major Long’s party during
their expedition to the Rocky Mountains, s.everal~tir_nes very
narrowly escaped from the grizzly bear. Once, while hunt-
ing, with another person, on one of the upper tributaries .of
the Missoiiri, he’ heard the report of his companion’s rifle,
and, when he looked round, beheldhini, at ’a shortdistance,

endeavouring to escape from one of these bears, which he
had wounded as it was coming towards him. 19. Dougher-
ty, f?.)rgetf'ul of every thing but the preservation of hisiriend,
hastened to call off’ theiattention of the bear, and arrived in
riﬂe-shot distance, just in time to effect his generous purpose.
He discharged his ball at the animal, and was obliged, in
his tun. to fly; his friend, relieved from immediate danger,
prepared for another attack, by charging his rifle, with which
he again wounded the bear, and sayed Mr. Douglierty from
further peril: neither received any injury from this encoun-
ter, in which the bear was, at length, killed.

20. 011. one occasion, several hunters were chased by a
grizzly bear, who rapidly gained upon them.  boy of the
party, who could not run so fast as his companions, perceiv-
ing the bear very near him, fell-with his face toward the
ground. The bear reared upon his hind feet, stood for a

moment, and then bounded over him in pursuit of the more 

distant fugitives.

9:1. Mr. Dougherty, the hunter before mentioned, relates
the following instance of the great muscular strength of the
grizzly bear. Having killed a bison, and left the carcass for
the purpose of procuring assistance to skin and cut it ll), he
was very much surprised, on his return, to find that it had

been dragged off‘, Whole, -toga considerable distance, by a  ii

grizzly bear, and was then placed in a pit, which the animal
had dug with his claws, for its reception.

The C'0ugar."*——THE swim.

I. Tim cougar is the largest animal, of the cat kind, found
in North America, and has, occasionally, received the name
of the American Zion, from "the similarity of its proportions
and colour to those of the lion of‘ the old world. ’ 2. It is very
little inferior in size, and not at all in the qualities of magna-
nirnity, clemency, and generosity, which have been‘; so lav-
ishly, yet so falsely, attributed to the “king of beasts?’ whom
we might believe to’ have been distinguished as royal, in de-
rision of some of the human species, who despctically rule
over their fellow‘-creatures, by virtue- of the “right divine”
of power. ‘ -

generally, is giaznaar, evidently a corruption ofpcmtfier.

iiao INTRODUCTION TO THE

3. The cougar may be stated to be about one third less in
size than the lion, and has no mane, nor tuft at the extremity
of the tail, which is about half the length of the body and
head_ as as as as are a‘(< at are as

4. The cougar was, at an early period, distributed, in con-
siderable numbers, over the whole of the warm and temper-
ate regions of the continent; and is still found, though by
no means abundantly, in the southern, middle, and north-
western parts of the Union; becoming, however, gradually,
more rare, a.s the population increases, and cultivation is ex-
tended. 5. lt is a savage and destructive‘animal,_yet timid
and cautious. In ferocity, it is quite equal to most of its
kindred species, and kills ‘numbers of small animals, for the
sake of drinking their blood ; and, when pressed by hunger,
attacks large quadrupeds, thoughmot always with success.

6. VVhen the cougar seizes a sheep or calf, it is by the
throat, and then, ﬂinging his victim over his back, he dashes
off, with great ease and celerity, to devour it at his leisure.
Deer, hogs, sheep, and calves, are destroyed by the cougar,
whenever they are within reach; and, occasionally, one or
two of these animals have committed extensive ravages
among the stock of the frontier settlers. 7. They climb, or,
rather, spring up large trees, swiithrsurprising facility and vig-
our; and, inthat way, are enabled, by dropping upon deer
and other quadrupeds, to secure prey, which it would be im-
possible for them to overtake. i

8. In the day time, the cougar is seldom seen; but, at
night, the experienced traveller frequently thrills with horror
at its peculiar cry, or he is startled to hear the cautious ap-
proaches of the, animal, stealing, step by step, towards him,
over the crackling brush andleaves, in expectation of spring-
ing uponﬁan unguarded or sleeping victim, whom nothing but
a rapid ﬂight can save.  9. That the cougar will attack ani-
mals of large size and Lgreat strerigth, is well known to those

who have resided where this beast is found. In proof of this, .

We here insert an extract from a letter, received in 1826, from
a scientiﬁc friend in Lexington, Kentucky, who, during twen-
ty-ﬁve or thirty years, has resided in the state of Ohio, and
made the study of natural history his chief amusement.

10. “ At the close of the late war, a merchant of Piqua,
named Hersey, received a considerable sum of money in
small bills, which made it appear-of still greater magnitude
to several suspicious looking persons, who were present
when it was received. 11. Hersey, being unarrned, was

NATi,GNAL ltii./§DEl?i,. 161

apprehensive that an attempt would be made to rob him, at
the camping ground, and expressed his apprehensions to a
single fellow traveller, who was, also, unprovided with arms.
IQ. In consequence, they resolved not to go to the camping
ground, but to pass the night in the woods, without ﬁre,—-
where, turning their horses loose, they lay down in their
blankets, on the leaves. 13. In the night, they were arous-
ed by hearing the horses snort, as they are apt to do on the
approach of lndians; and, shortly after, they were heard to
inake several bounds through the woods, as if some one had
unsuccessfully attempted to catch them. 14. After some
time had elapsed, they both distinctly heard what they sup-
posed to be a man, crawling towards them on his hands and
feet; as they could hear, first, one hand cautiously extended
and pressed, very gently, on theleaves, to avoid making a
noise, then the other, and, finally, the other limbs, in like
niarrner', and with equal care. 15. "When they believed that
this felonious visiter was within about ten feet of them, they
touched each other, sprang up simultaneously, and rushed
to some distance through the woods. where they crouched,
and remained Without further disturbance. 16. A short time
after, they heard the horses snorting and bounding furiously
through the woods; but they_did. not ‘venture to rise until
broad day-light, being still ignorant of the character of their
enemy.

17. “‘When it was sufliciently light for them to see, by
climbing a sapling, they discovered the horses, at a consid-
erable distance, on the prai’rié. On approaching’ them, it
was evident that their disturber had» been nothing less than
a cougar. 18. It had sprung upon the horses, and so lacer-
ated the poor creatures with its teeth and claws, that, with
the greatest difiiculty, they were able to drive them. Sev-
eral other instances of annoyance to travellers had happened
at the same place, and, as it was believed, by the same
cougar.” 3* * ""‘ ii‘ ' if‘ i l‘‘ if. ’i‘ ""‘

E9. In the remote and thinly-settled parts of Pennsylva-
nia, the cougar is still, occasionally, found; and the following
relation of the manner in which two of these animals were
recently killed, will be read with interest, from the singular-
ity of the attendant circumstances.

Mr. John Mitchell, on the eighth of December, 1825, shot

at a buck, and wounded him in the shoulder. He followed

the animal for some time, and, at length, perceived. him, at
14 ""

16:-2 T INTRODUCTION TO THE

the distance of about forty yards, lying with his heels up-
ward, and a cougar holding him by the throat. 21. The hun-
ter discharged his riﬂe at t.he cougar, and shot him through
the heart, when this animal relinquished the buck, advanced
four or ﬁve yards, and fell lifeless. 9'3. Having again char-
ged his riﬂe, and believing the panther to be dead, Mitchell,
turning towards the wounded buck, was surprised to see

V A. j another cougar, in the act of pulling down his head ; for, as
y it now appeared, the buck had been held down by the throat
: by both cougars, at the moment the first was killed. 23. The

body of the buck was between the hunter and the second
cougar, nothing but the head of which was visible. At this,
Mitchell levelled his riﬂe, and the ball entered atethe angle
of the eye. 24. The beast remained still for a few minutes,
and then, for the first ti1ne,'relinquished his hold of the buck,
and walked over it towards the hunter, who ﬁred his riﬂe
a second time, and shot him through in the neighbourhood
of the heart. 25. At this moment, the buck recovered his
legs, stumbled over the body of the cougar, finally extricated
himself, and ran off. 26. A third discharge of the riﬂe
pierced the cougar with another ball; yet he still remained
on his feet: and'_it Was not until the riﬂe was again charged,
and a fourth ball“'driven through the back part of the under
jaw, that the animal fell and expired. 5'“ * * *7‘

27. The following account of the destruction. of a large
cougar, whose skin is still preserved in the New York Mu-
seum,was given by the late Mr. Scudder. Two hunters, ac-
companiefg ,by:j.two, dogs, went"o‘ut in quest of game near the
Kaatskill Mountains- 28. At thefoot of a large hill, they
agreed .to go round it, in opposite"di'rectio.ns,._and, when either
discharged his-riﬂe,itihegotlier was to hasten towards him to
aid insecuring‘?itheagiame. {j529. Soon after parting, the re-
portof’ ariﬂe ‘was heardbyofne of them, who, hastening

towards spot, aiter” some search, found the dog of the _
‘-other, dreadfully7‘lacerated, and dead. 30. He now be-

came much -ialarmeid for the fate of his companion, and,
while anxiouslyilooking around, was horror-struck by the
harsh growl of a cougar, that he perceived, on a large limb 0!
a tree, crouching upon the body of his friend, and, apparent-
ly, meditating an attack on himself. 31.. Instantly he levelled
his riﬂe at the beast, and was so fortunate as to wound it

mortally, when it fell to the ground along with the body of H
a his slaughtered companion. His dog then rushed upon the.

wounded cougar,which, with one blow of its paw, laid the

7. Vi7hat more delightful theme can occupy our thoughts,
or animate our souls, than that which this occasion inspires’!
It is in vain that we attempt to pursue the ordinary current
of every-day enipioyrnent. Fruitless and unavailing are all
the intrusions of personal aﬁhirs and selﬁsh concerns. 8. The
power of association is too. strong to allow us to rest upon
the present. VVe are, irresistibly, carried back to the past,----
to the day ofour fa'thers,———and) irnagination is busy in calling
up the forms of departed warriors and sages, clothing them

again in their garments rolled in blood, and delineating the

scenes where heroes “met, and met to die.”

9. Not half a century has yet elapsed since these inde-
pendent states Were British colonies. , VVhat changes have
been wrought in that short period ! Then, the thirteen states
could muster but a handful of men, and those few they could
with difliculty feed and clothe, and still more poorly arm, for
the defence of the country. 10, Now, the number of our
independent states is almost doubled, our population increas-
ed beyond all precedent, our militia armed and equipped for
any emergency, and our navy bearing our flag triumphant
over every sea. 11. Then, we were oppressed and feeble;
now, free and unconquerable. Then, we were conﬁned to
a narrow strip of land, bordering on the Atlantic Ocean,

 now, the wilderness, which hemmed us in, has been convert-

ed to the abodes of plenty and=.a- peace. 12. Then, we were
scarcely numerous enough to heat back the invader from the
shore, and had no bond of union but that. common one, which
unites the feeble against the strong; now, we are seeking
new regions inwhich to plant cities, and sending forth our
thousands and/tens’ of thousands, to diffuse the blessings of
arts, literature, and civilization. 13. Then, even our pov-

erty was the prey of a foreign tax-gatherer, and ‘we were

indebted to foreign merchants for loans to carry on a defen-
sive warfare; now, our citizens are bestowing a portion of
their wealth upon nations struggling for independence. 

 Fearless, our merchant now pursues his gain,
T And roams, securely, o'er the boundless main:

Now, o’er his head, the polar hear he spies,
And freezing spangles of the La uland skies :
Now swells his canvass to the sultry line, _
VVith glittering spoils where Indian grottoes shine;
Where fumes of incense glad the southern seas,
‘Ami waited cétnin seems the ba,l.my- breeze.

LESSON XCHI.
Tkc s(.mze,——c0ntz'nued.

1. THERE is, probably, no man living, whose history par-
takes so largely of the spirit of romance and chivalry, as that
of the individual who is now, emphatically, the guest of the
people. At the age of nineteen years, he left his country,
and espoused the cause of the American colonies. 2. His
motive for this conduct must have been one of the noblest
that ever actuated the heart of man. He was in possession
of large estates; allied to the highest orders of French no-
bility; surrounded by friends and relatives; with prospects

I of future distinction and favour as fair as ever opened to the

ardent view of aspiring and ambitious youth. 3. He was
just married to a lady of great worth and respectability, and
it would seem that nothing was wanting to a life of afiluence
and ease. Yet, Lafayette left his friends, his wealth, his
country, his prospects (if distinction, his wife, and all the
sources of domestic bliss, to assist a foreign nation in its
struggle for freedom,‘ and at a time, too, when the prospects
of that country’s success were dark, disheartening, and almost
hopeless. 4. He fought for that country, he fed and clothed
her armies, he imparted of his wea.lth to her poor. He saw
her purposes accomplished, and her government established
on principles of liberty. He refused all compensation for
his services. He returned to his Ilu.lLlVC land, and engaged
in contests for liberty there.;[5. He was imprisoned by a
foreign government, suffered every indignity and every cru-

elty that could be inflicted, and lived, after his release,
almost an exile on the spot where he. was born. 6. More

than forty years after he first embarked in the cause. of
American liberty, he returns tosee, once more, his few
surviving companions in arms, and is met by the grateful
salutations of the whole nation. 7. It isnot possible to
reﬂect on these facts, without feeling our admiration excited
to a degree, that almost borders‘ on reverence. Sober his-
torg, it is hoped, will do justice to the name of Lafayette.
It is not in the power of ﬁction to embellish his character
or his life. , ,

which he loved to retreat, to view the World he had im-
proved and blessed, are the sacred depository of his relies.

its spiry crest, points out, to the traveller, the ‘spot where the
hero sleeps; although no sculptured monument preserves
the name, no inscription records the achievements, of “ the
sole heir of unrebuked applause ;” yet is the spot dearer to
the souls of. the free, more familiar to the steps of the grate»

can boast. 14. The path is trodden by hermit feet; the

LESSON VI.
Danger of Dz's0bedz'ence.-—-—ANoNYMoUs.

1. A GENTLEMAN, who lived in the country, had a very
ﬁne piece of water, in his gard’en1, on which there was a
pleasure-boat. Very fréquently, in ﬁne weather, he used to
take his children with him, and row them about for a good
while, as they were all fond of the amusement.

2. Sometimes he would indulge his two eldest sons, Hugh?
and Robert, with the oars when he was pres’ent, and let
them row the boat; but he gave them a strict charge never
to attempt to do so when he was not with them; nor were
they, upon any3 account, ever to go into the boat by them-
selves, and without‘ leave.

3. But these boys were sometimes so naughty4, when they
thought they were not seen, as to venture5 in, and move the
boat about as much as they could, whilst it was moored, that
is, tied to a post by the shore. '

4. Two or three times they had been caughtﬁ, and even
punished for doing so; yet one day, when they thoughgtheir
father and mother were both out, they agreed theyggould
venture again into the boat. , 

5. “ There can be no harm init,” said Hugh; “ we shall
be quite safe; and even’ if we should overset her, and fall
out, at the worst, it would only give us a ducking, and»; If am
sure it could not hurt these old clothes7; so come along.”

6. Robert could not feel so easy about the matter. “ I do

and mamma’ are not with us.”

7. “ Pooh! nonsense !:’ replied Hugh; “what a fuss you
make about your gmte rzgiztt.’ What harm 1S there in it?
If they do not see us, they cannot be uneasy‘; so come along;
it is a ﬁne afternoon, and we will have a nice row.”

8. “ You don’t mean,” rejoined Robert, “to unmoor the
boat, do you ?”———“ Yesl, indeed do I,” replied his brother;
“I can push her off from the land, for I understand how to
do it very well ; so come along, I say, and do not waste any
more time with your scruples and non’sen.se.”

9. So sayinrr, he scrambled into the boat, and helped his

brother in. ﬁobert then, though his mind did not feel at all
easy, assisted to loosen. the boat from the post it was chained
to, and they soon pushed oﬁ" from the land.
. 10. “There, now,” said Hugh; “I told you I could do
it, and I wonder what the mighty harm IS of our taking a
nice row, and enjoying ourselves this delightful afternoon.
Don’t you ﬁnd it very pleasant?”

11. “It is pleasant enough, to be sure,” replied Robert,
“ but I cannot say I enjoy It much. I am sure we are doing
wrong. We were? told not toget into the boat at all; there-
fore we ought not to do it. I wish, with all my heart, I had
not come. But let us row back again, a.. c I will get out
directly.” '

12. “Indeed, I shall not go back for a long time,” said
Hugh. “Now we have disobeyed3, and got into theboat,
we may as well stay and enjoy ourselves, for an hour or two.

If my father knows of our being in it for only a minute4, he

will be just as angry as if We stay in ever so long.”

13. “ But I think,” resumed5 Robert, “that the longer we
are naughty, so much the worse boys we are5. If we have
done a wrong thing, the sooner we do right again the better

weshall be; therefore I am resolved not to stay here; so’

pray put back again.” A

14. “ Not I, indeed,” said his brother, “ for I am resolved
to stay till it is dark ;_ so row away, my lad.”——“ I will row
to the shore,” said Robert.-—-—“ And I will row into the mid-
dle,” said Hugh; “ so pull away, let us both tug at our oars,
and see which will gain his pur’pose ﬁrst.”

15. They then both exerted7 their utmost strength, but

Robert, ﬁnding it impossible to get back again, threw down a

the oar, and, bursting into tears, said, “ I see you are resolved
not only to be wicked yourself, but to make me wicked also.
I think it is ve-ryiinkind to compel me to stay here, when I
wish so very much to go back-."” I .

16. “Well, come along,” said -Hugh, rather pettishly,
“take up your oar again, and go back, if you will ; but I
think it is you that are unkind, not to stay out when I wish
it sowmuch. . But you shall not say I made you wicked.”
Robert then gladly took up his oar, and in a -few minutes
waswagain safe on‘ shore. I

17. No sooner did Robert ﬁnd" himself out of the‘ boat,
than his eyes sparkledl with joy, and he tried all he could to
persuade his brother to get out also. But Hugh positively

refused, and pushed himself off from the land, as he had I

done before. -— t -

into the water, isunikt»-to:3the bottom, -to rise no more.

The Horse.—LEc'rUnEs ON NATURAL HISTORY.

  

1. THE various ex’cellences of this noble animal, the gran- I

deurg of his stature, the elegance and proportion of his parts,
the beautiful smoothness of his, skin, the vari’ety and grace-

fulness of his motions, and, above all, his usefulness, enti’tle

him to a precé’dence in (“the history of the brute creation.

2. A horse is a very sagacious creature; he knows his
own ‘stable; and can smell it afar off;' when he—.-‘"sees"" or smells
any horse that he knows, he neighs3 togit, and often gets an
answer in _the same way. * I ' ' c

3. This animal never forgets any place where he hasonce

been; and he willvﬁnd his way home froma "great. <lJistia‘n5;'e,
even by a road on ‘which he has nevergone before, " 

4. Heis also a very doci1e4 creature; and, whent .
carry a person on his back, his rider governs him by his*s‘e‘n‘se

of feeling, that is, by the curb, which he gives him, with the

bit, by a touch with his spurs, or by a stroke with his
whip.

5. The horse is quick-sighted; he can see things in the

night, which his rider cannot perceive; but when it is too
dark for his sight, his sense of smelling is his guide. VVhen
he smells a ditch, a pond, or a lake, he will start back, to the
great surprise of his master.

6. A horse sleeps much less than we do. He requires so
much time to feed in, that (if we allow for the hours which
he has to work, often twelve in the day, and sometimes
more) he seldom rests above three or four hours out of the
twenty—four; yet he is not soon tired, though his work is
often hard, and his time of fasting often long.

7. In summer, horses, in the country, feed on grass, or on
grass and oats; and in winter, they eat oat.s, corn and hay.
When grazing in the pasture, they always choose the shortest
grass, because it is the sweetest; and, as they have cutting
teeth in both their jaws, they can eat very near the ground.

8. The age of a horse may be known by his teeth until he
is six or seven years old, but with certainty no longer; yet
horse-dealers, by an art well known to themselves, caﬁ"‘make
a horse appear to be four or five years old, when he is not
more than three, or three and a half. By this trick, they not
only deceive the buyer, which is very wrong, but also ruin
the horse, by making him subject to harder labour than his
strength can bear.

9. A horse, if properly treated, commonly lives to the age

-of twenty-five or thirty years; and, when he dies, his skin

is taken off, and sold to the tanner, to be made into leather
for shoes and boots, and for many other purposes. The
leather made from it, however, is not so strong as that made
of the calf-skin.

10. The ﬂesh of a horse is not good for us to eat; his
mane and tail are made into very good coverings for chair

bottoms and -sofas, and answer a good purpose for ﬁshing-

lines.

11. There are many varieties of the horse. Among those
in a domestic state, we ﬁnd the 7'd’cer, slender, with elegant
limbs, and capable of great speed ; the truck Izorse, heavy and
clumsy, but very strong and useful; the carriage horse, with
his beautiful and smooth skin, polished by high feeding; and
the c/Larger, or war horse, of which we have the following

spirited and highly poetical description in the thirty-ninth

0

chapter of the book of Job 1--

?3’{A'i‘i0NAL £{E£i&DEE§’n 19

12 " Hast thou given the horse his strength “I.
Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder"!
Canst thou make him afraid, as a grasshopper?
The glory of his nostrils is terrible I

13. “ He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength:
He goeth on to meet the arm’éd men :
He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted ;
Neither turneth he back from the sword‘.

14. “ The quiver rattleth against him,
The glittering spear and the shield.
He swalloweth the ground with ﬁérceness and rage:
He standeth not still when the trumpet soundeth.

15, “ He saith among the trumpets, aha’, {rhea 1
And he smelleth the battle afar off-—
The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.”

16. Horses are found in a wild state, in the extensive
plains of Arabia and Africa, where they range without con-
trol. They are also found wild in the immense plains west
of the Mississippi river, and in South America, having been
originally brought from Europe by the Spaniards.

17. In these plains, the wild horses may be seen feeding
together in herds of several hundreds, and sometimes thou-
sands; one of them acting as a sen’tinel to give notice of the
approach of an enemy. This he does by a kind of snorting
noise, upon which they all set off at full speed, making the
very ground tremble with the noise of their hoofs. The wild
horses of Arabia are esteemed the most beautiful in the
world.

LESSON VIII.
Anecdotes of the II0rse.——-_TrIE SAME.

, 1. THERE are many anecdotes, which prove that the horse
is not only very sagacious, but, what is much more interesting
and pleasing, that he has feelings of honour, gratitude, and
kindness, which should always ensure to him the gentlest
treatment, and which greatly heightens the guilt of those in-
human persons, who unmercifully beat and abusehim.

2. VVe will select a few of the best authenticated anecdotes

C

The ﬁ'z'endly Iforse.

3. “There was a team of horses belonging to the Earl1 of
Madclesﬁéld, in Oxfordshire, England: one of the horses
was naturally vi’cious and ill-tempered, and one quite the
reverse’.

4. “ Next to the good-natured horse, there was placed, in
the stable, another, that had the misfortune to be blind. In
the summer season, they used to be turned out to grass with
other horses, and this very good-tempered creature constantly
took his blind friend under his protection.

5. “ If, when they were turned loose, the blind horse hap-
pened to take a wrong direction, and got at a distance from
hiscompanion, he would discover the greatest distress, by
neigh’ing and running about the ﬁeld, where his friénd’ly
guide used to place himself in such a position that he might
run against him, when, after rec’ognising his friend, he would
begin to feed with the greatest conﬁdence and composure.

6. “ But, what appears still more extraor’dinary, this horse
was naturally of so peaceable a disposition, that he had in-
curred the character of being a coward, when only himself
was concerned ; but if any of them made an attack upon his
blind friend, he would ﬂy into so great a fury, that not a
horse in the ﬁeld could stand against him.

7. “ ‘Whenever it happened that the other horse broke the
fence, and went astray, this faithful creature never once left

‘his unfortunate companion, thoughhe sometimes conducted

him through the gap into the adjoining ﬁeld; nor did he ever
sustain an injury from several deep pits, to which he was
exposed.

8. “ Might not this conduct put to the blush many to whom
the Almighty has given more knowledge than to the beasts
that perish ?”

9. Bewick, in his History of Quadrupeds, relates the fol«
lowing: _ i

“ Until of late years, pack-horses were employed, in the
northern counties of England, to carry the different mam’;-

’ fac’tures and articles of traﬂick from one part of the kingdom
to another; but the improved state of the roads in that
a country has caused that mode of conveyance to be almost

entirely laid aside.

10. ‘‘In their journeys over trackless moors, the pack-
horses strictly adhere to‘ the line of rorder and regularity,
which custom has taught them to observe. The leading
horse, which is always chosen for his sagacity‘ and stéad’iness,

being furnished with bells, gives notice to rest, -who fol-'

sometimes at a considerable distance. 

.11. “The following anecdote will show with what obsti-

of their order. Some years ago, ‘oneof these horses,‘ which
had been "long accustomed to follow his leader, by accident
or fatigue was thrown into an inferior rank.‘ . E i

LESSON XI.
A faction to Parents rewardecl.——ANoNYMoUs.

l. FREDERICK, the late king of Prussia, having rung his
bell one day, and nobody answering, opened the door where
h1s_servan_t was usually in waiting, and found him asleep on
a sofa. He was going to awake him, when he perceived
the end of a billet, or letter, hanging out of his pocket.

2. Having the curiosity to know its contents‘, he took and
read it, and found that it was a letter from his mother,
thanking him for having sent her a part of his wages, to
assist her in her distress, and concluding with beseeching
God to bless him for his ﬁlial attention to her wants.

3. The king returned softly to his room, took a roll of
di’ic’ats, and slid them, with the letter, into the page’s pocket.
Returning to his apartment, he rung so violently, that the
page awoke, opened the door, and entered. .4. “ You have
slept well,” said the king. The page made an apology, and,
in his embar’rassment, happened to put his hand into his
pocket, and felt with astonishment the roll. He drew it out,
turned pale, and, looking at the king, burst into tears, with
out being able to speak a word.

5. “ What is the matter ?” said the king; “ what ails you '5”
“Ah! sire,” said the young man, throwing himself at his
feet, “somebody has wished to ruin me. I know not how
I came by this moneyin my pocket.” 6. “ My friend,” said
Frederick, “ God often sends us good in our sleep: send the
money to your mother; salute her in my name; and assfrre
her that I shall take care of her and you.”

7. This story furnishes an excellent instance of the gratitude
and duty, which children owe to their aged, inﬁrm, or unfor-
tunate parents. And, if the children of such parents shall
follow the example of Frederick’s servant, though they may
not meet with the reward that was conferred on him, they

‘shall be amply rec’ompensed by the pleasing testimony of

their own minds, and by that God who approves, as he has
commanded, every expression of ﬁlial love.

LESSON XII.
The honest JlI0ravz°an.——'I‘HoMsoN’s COLLECTION.

1. IN the last war in Germany, a captain of cavalry was out
on a foraging party. On perceiving a cottage in the midst

of a solitary valley, he went up and knocked at the door.
Out came one of the Moravians, or United Brethren, with a
beard silvered by age. 2. “ Father,” says the officer, “ show
me a ﬁeld where I can set Inytroopers a for’aging.” “Pres-
ently,” replied the Moravian. The good old man walked
before, and conducted them out of the valley.

3.. After a quarter of an hour’s march, they found a ﬁne
ﬁeld of barley‘. “There is the very thing we want,” says
the‘ captain. “Have patience for a few minutes,” replied
his guide ; “ you shall be satisfied.” 4. They went on, and at
the distance of about a quarter of a league farther, they arrived
at anotlier ﬁeld of barley. The troop immediately dismounted,
cut down the grain, trussed it up, and remounted. 5. The
officer, upon this, says to his conductor, “ Father, you have
given yourself and us unnecessary trouble: theﬁrst ﬁeld was
much better than this.” “Very true, sir,” replied the good
ild man, “ but it was not mine.” I '

Br. F2'an.Zclin’s_ﬁrst Entrance into Pltilacletyiitia.———FnANnLIN.

I. I HAVE-entered into the particulars of my voyage, and
shall, in like manner, describe my ﬁrst entrance into this-city,
that you may be able to compare beginnings so iittle auspi-
cious with the ﬁgure I have since made.

‘2. G11 my arrival at Philadel’_phia, I was in my working
dress, my best clothes being to come by sea. I was covered
with dirt; my pockets were ﬁlled with shirts and stockings;
I was unacqu-ainted with a single soul in the place, and knew
not where to seek a lodging. 3. Fatigued with walking,

rowing, and having passed the night without sleep, I was “

extremely hungry, and all my mon’ey consisted of a Dutch
dollar, and about a shilling.’s worth of coppers, which I gave
to the boatmen for my passage. I 4. As I had assisted them
in rowing, they refused it at ﬁrst; but I insisted on their
taking it. A man is sometimes more generous when he has
little, than when he has much mon’ey; probably because, in
the first case, he is desirous of concealing his poverty‘.

5. I walked towards the top of the street, looking eagerly
on both sides, till I came to Market Street, Where I met with
a child with a loaf of bread. Often had I made my dinner
on dry bread. I inquired where he had bought it, and Went
straight to the baker’s shop, which he pointed .out. to me.

26 I INTRODUCTION TO THE

6. I asked for some his’cuits1, expecting to find such as we
had at Boston; but they made, it seems, none of that sort at
Philadelphia. I then asked for a threepennyg loaf. They
made no loaves of that price. 7. Finding myselfignorant
of the prices, as well as of the different kinds of bread, I
desired him to let me have threepenny-worth of bread of
some kind or other. 8. He gave me three large rolls. I
was surprised at receiving so much: I took them, however,
and, having no room in my pockets, I walked on with a roll
under each arm, eating a third. 9. In this manner I went
through l‘t/Iarket Street to Fourth Street. and passedithe house
of Mr. Read, the father of my future wife. She was stand-
ing at the door, observed me, and thought, with reason, that
I made a very singular and grotesque?’ appearance.

I0. I then turned the corner, and went through Chestnut
Street, eating my roll all the way; and, having made" this
round, I found myself again on Market Street wharf, near
the boat in which I arrived. 11. I stepped into it to take a
draught of the river water; and, ﬁnding myself satisﬁed with
my first roll, I gave the other two to a woman and her child,
who had come down with us in the boat, and was waiting to
continue her journey4. 12. Thus refreshed, I regained the
street, which was new full of well-dressed people, all going
the same way. I joined them, and was thus led to a large
Q;.uakers’ meeting-house near the market place. 13. I sat
down with the rest, and, after looking round me for some
time, hearing nothing said, and being drowsy from my last
night’s labour and want of rest, I fell into a sound sleep.
14. In this state I continued till the assembly dispersed,
when one of the congregation had the goodness to wake me.
This was consequently the first house I entered, or in which
I slept, at Philadelphia.

LESSON XIV.
Tire Rose.——Mi-is. SIGOURNEY.

1. I saw a rose perfect in beauty; it tested grﬁigfiilly
upon its stalk, and its per’fume ﬁlled the air. Many stopped
to gaze upon it, many bowed to taste its fragrance, and its
owner hung over it with delight. 2. I passed it again, and,

behold, it was gone—-—its stem was 1eaﬂess—-its root had with-

ered ; the enclosure which surrounded it was broken down.
3.‘ The spoiler had been there ; he saw that many admired
it; he knew it was dear to him who planted it, and beside
it he had no other plant to love. 4. -Yet he snatchedit
secretly from the hand that cher'ished it; he wore it on his
bosom till it hung its head and faded, and, when he saw that
its glory was departed, he ﬂung it rudely away. 5. But it
left a thorn in his bosom, and vainly did he seek to extract

’ it; for now it pierces the spoiler, even in his hour of mirth.

6. And when I saw that no man, ‘who had loved the

beauty of the rose, gath’ered again its scattered leaves, or

bound up the stalk which the hands of violence had broken,
I looked earn’estly at the spot where it grew, and my soul
received instruc’tion. 7. And I said, Let her who is full of
beauty and admiration, sitting like the queen of ﬂowers in
1na’jesty among the daughters1 of womeng, let her watch lest
vanity enter her heart, beguil’ing her to rest proudly upon her
own strength; let her reineniber that she standeth upon
slippery places, “ and be not high-minded, but fear.”

Story  Gofe, the Ré”g'Zcide.*--—PREsiDENT DWIGHT.

1. IN the course of Philip’s war, which involved almost
all the Indian3 tribes in New England, and among others
those in the neigh’bou1-hood of Hadley, the inhabitants
thought it proper to observe the ﬁrst of September, 1675, as
a day of fasting and prayer,-» 2. While they were in the
church, and employed in their wor’ship, they were surprised
by a band of savages. The people instantly betook them-
selves to their arms,———which, according to the custom of the
times, they had carried with them to the church;--and, rush-
ing out of the house, attacked their invaders. 3. The pan’ic,
unﬂer which they began the conﬂict, was, however, so great,
and, their number was so dispropoﬂtioned to that of their
enemies,‘ that they fought4~doubtfully at ﬁrst, and in a short
time began evidently to give way. '

differing from that of the inhabitants, appeared suddenly at
their head, and, with a ﬁrm voice and an example of un-
daunt’ed resolution, reanimated their spirits, led them again
to the conflict, and totally routed the savages. 5. When the
battle was ended, the stranger disappeared; and no person
knew whence he had come, or whither he had gone
6. The relief was so timely, so sudden, so unexpected, and
so providential; the appearance and the retreat of him who
furnished it were so unaccountable ; his person was so digni-s
ﬁed and commanding, his resolution so superior, and his
interference so decisive, that the inhabitants, without any
uncommon exercise of credulity, readily believed him to be
an angel, sent by Heaven for their preservation. 7. Nor
was this opinion seriously controverted, until it was discover-
ed, several years afterward, that Goffe and Whalley had been
lodged in the house of Mr. Russell. Then it was known
that their deliverer was Goffe; Whalley having become
superannuated some time before the event took place.

LESSON XVI.
The Camel.-——From BIGLAND.

1. THE cam’el is a native of Arabia, and is chieﬂy conﬁned
to that and the adja’cent countries, where it has, from time
immemorial, been usedlin trav"ersing those immense deserts
of burning sand, which are irriirassable to every other quad’-
ruped except the drom’edary, which, although distinguished
by a dilferent name, and by having two hunches on its back,
while the camel has only one, is supposed to be originally of
the same race.

2. The camel is, to the Arabian, what the rein-deer is to
the Laplander. Its milk is rich and nutritive; its ﬂesh,
when young, is excellent food, wholesome and invigorating ;
and its hair,‘ or ﬂeece, which falls of? always in the spring, is
manufactured into ﬁne stuffs, and almost every article neces-
sary for elothing, bedding, and the covering of their tents.

3. To comprehend the full value of this animal, we must
figure to ourselves a country without verdurel and without
water, where a clear sky and burning "sun above (from

which no friendly shade affords a shelter’) parches every_

living creature with intolerable thirst; while an immense

w

1 Pron. ver’-jﬁr

NATIONAL READER. -29

expanse of scorched. sands, beneath, presents to the eye a
dreary scene of barren uniformity, in which no object re»
minds the traveller of -the existence of animated nature.
4. Such are those immense deserts which the camel and the
dromedary alone can traverse. It is, therefore, no wonder
that the Arab regards the camel as an ines’tim:‘ible present
from Heaven——a sacred animal, without the aid of which he
could not subsist in those frightful deserts, which secure his

independence, and surround him with an impreg’nable ram-.

part. 5. In Turkey, Arabia, Persia, and Eygpt, their whole
commerce is carriedion by means of those useful animals.

6. Of all the quadrupeds with which the earth is replen-
ished, this is the most tame and_ submissive: he kneels down
to be loaded and unloaded, and, even when overbur’dened,
often makes the most piteous‘ complaints without offering
the least resistance. 7. He is, at the same time, so ex-
tremely sensible of injustice or ill treatment, that, whenthis
is carried too far, the inﬂicter will not ﬁnd it easy to escape
his vengeance. 8. It is said he will retain the remembrance
of an injury, till ‘an opportunity offers for gratifying his
revenge. Eager, however, to express his resentment, he
no longer retains any rancour when once he is satisﬁed.
9. When an Arab, therefore, has excited the rage of a cam-
el, he throws down his garments in some place near which
the animal is to pass, and dispéses them in such a manner
that they appear to cover ,_a man sleeping under them.
10. The animal rec’ognises ‘the clothesg, seizes them in his
teeth, shakes them with violence,‘and tramples on them in a
rage. ‘When his anger is appeased, he leaves them, and
then the owner of the garments may make his appearance
without any fear, and may load and guide himias he pleases.

11. In viewing the singular conformation of this animal,
we cannot fail toitrace the evident markswhich it bears. of a
regular design, in an organization so wonderfully adapted to
the pur’poses for which he is used, and to the place which
he isappointed to hold in the system of animated nature.
12. iHis feet are peculiarly adapted to «me soil on which he
is to tread. They are liable to be injured by travelling on

stones; and he cannot well support himself on. moist and.

slippery clays; but his broad ‘hoofs are perfectly calculated
for travelling on‘ the dry and parched sands of Arabia.

13. But the peculiar and distinguishing characterist’ic of the,‘ ,

1 Pram. pitsh’-e-us. 9 cloze

30 lN'I‘R()DUC'1‘I()N T0 Tris.

camel, is its faculty of abstaining from Water longer than any
other animal—~—a property so necessary in those immense
deserts. 14. For this the God of nature has provided by a
singular internal conformation ; for, besides -the four stomachs
which he has, in common with other ruminating animals, he

is also furnished with a fifth bag, that serves as a reservoir"

for water, where it remains uncorrupted, and without min-
gling with the other aliments. 15. Wlieii the camel is
pressed with thirst, or has need of water to moisten his
aliinent, in chewing the cud, he draws up into the stomach,
or even into the throat, a part of this reserve. 16. Furnished
with so capacious and so convenient a receptacle, he can
take a prodigious quantity of water at once, and remain many
days without drinking. . .

17. It is remarkable, that all attempts to introduce either
the camel or the rein-deer into other countries than those
to which they originally belong, have completely failed.
18. Both the one and the other appear evidently designed
by Providence for the service and solace of man, in those
countries where no other animals are qualified to supersede
their utility.

LESSON XVII.
The Half is better than the W/hole : an Eastern TaZe.—

ANONYMOUS.

1. THE sun was pouring his merid’ian rays upon the Arabian
des’ert, when a caravan halted for refreshment and repose.
2. The tents were arranged for shade, the camels were un-

' laden, and each tired Mus-’sulman, reclining upon the sand,

enjoyed his favourite luxury of the pipe, or listened to one
of those long, dull tales, with which the inhabitants of the
East are wont to amuse each other in their journeyings
through the desert. ,

3. Two little boys, the only children in the whole com»
pany, alone were restless, active, and impatient of restraint.
4. As they were not allowed to smoke, and had no taste for

the tedious1 stories that amused their elders, they wandered.

among the camels, and climbed upon their backs together,
and, at last, for want of other entertainment, quarrelled and

then separated. to ﬁnd each his own amusement apart.

19. Each the two brothers hastened to the rocks. Selina
enjoyed the surprise, the delight of Ali, at the sight of the
fountain and the tree. He found his own pleasure doubled
in witnessing that of his brother. 20. The Water seemed
cooler, the fruit had a higher flavour, when Ali joined his
praises of both. The glare of the sun was less regarded.
They talked, arid laughed; they atel, and drank; 21. Se-
lirn’s enjoyinent was now perfect; and from that day to the
end of his life, he never forgot, that, of whatever fountains
of pleasure, or fruits of joy, we may find on our pil’grimage
through the world, the haif is better———-much better——-than the
whole. ‘

LESSON XVIII.
The Ifistoiy of J0se]7.7t.’*

L Jiieoe had twelve sons, Reuben, Simeon, Lé’vi, Judah,
ls’sachar, and Zeb’uli”in; Dan and Naph’tali; Gad and
Asher; Joseph and Benjamin; and a daughter, Dinah.

2. Most of these were the cause of much grief to their
father. Reuben was guilty of great wickedness; Simeon
and Levi murdered a whole city, for the crime of the
prince’s son towards their sister; and they all behaved very
ill to Joseph, though Reuben and Judah were not so bad as
the rest.

3. Joseph and Benjamin were the sons of Rachel, the
favourite wife of Jacob, and were born when he was old.
For these reasons, and perhaps because he was better than
they, his father loved Joseph, and dressed him in finer
clothes than the others.

4. But it is very foolish for parents to show partiality to
any of their children, except for some great and plain differ-
ence in their beha’viour ; for that makes children hate their
parents, and abuse the brother or sister who is treated better
than the rest.

5. Thus did the sons of Jacob to Joseph. They were
envious of his father’s fondness for him ; and, because he told
their father when they aeted wrong, and related to them some

dreams, which they conceived foretold that he would after-
wards be superior to them, they hated him.

6. One day, when he came to see them, at a distance
from their father’s house, they took him, and resolved to
kill him; but Reuben persuaded} them to throw him into
a dry pit, intending to take him out, and restore him to his
father.

7’. But a company of slave merchants passing by, Judah,
who knew not Reuben’s designg, proposed, in his absence,
‘that, rather than kill him, they should sell him for a slave.
The merchants, having bought him, carried him into Egypt,
and sold him to Potiphar, a chief officer of Pha’ra6h3 king
of Egypt. A

8. In the mean time, the brothers brought home the coat
of Joseph, which Jacob had given him, having ﬁrst dipped it
in the blood of a kid which they had killed; and Jacob
mourned exceedingly for his son, supposing that a Wild beast
had devoured him.

9. In all this they acted with great wickedness; for it is
the duty of children to love their brothers and sisters, and

not to quarrel with and hate one another, but to forgive and A

forget the offences of each other, and to strive to help and
please, and make each other happy.

10. Joseph knew his duty in this respect much better than
his brothers ; for, when they came to be in want, he did not
keep in mind what they had done to him, but kindly took
care of them, and fed them.

11. Potiphar, to whom he had been sold in Egypt, was
greatly pleased with him, and made him steward over all his
house. His wife, however, who was a bad woman, would
have tempted Joseph to very great wickedness. But faithful-

ness to his master, and piety to God, preserved him from it. ‘

12. This enraged her so, that she accused him to her hus-
band, and he was thrown into prison. But God was kind to

, him, and gave him favour in the eyes of the keeper of the

prison ; nor will God ever forsake those who are steadfast in
their duty, though he may suffer them to be afflicted for their
ood.
g 13. It happened that two of Ph{.’ra6h’s servants were with
him 111 the prison, and dreamed each a dream in the same
night. God enabled Joseph to explain their ‘dreams, and
what he foretold came to pass; one was hanged, andithe

other restored to his place. But this man did not remember,
in his prosperity, the kindness he had received in his afflic-
tlon.

14. At length the king had two dreams ; and God enabled
Joseph to show him, that they meant, that, after seven years
of great plenty, there would be seven years of grié’vous
famine. So he advised the king to lay up all the spare corn
in the country, till the years of famine should come, that he
and his people might not perish.

15. The king was so pleased with Joseph’s advice, that
he made him the chief governor of his kingdom, and gave
him power to gather the spare corn, and to lay it up against
the seven years of famine. 16. This trust he faithfully dis-

‘ charged, and, when the years of famine came, he sold it out

to the people, while their money lasted, and afterwards made
an agreement with them for their ﬂocks and lands, to hold
them as Pha’ra6h’s tenants, on the payment of a fifth part
for rent.

LESSON XIX.
The same, concluded.

I. THUS there was plenty of food in Egypt, while the
neighbouring countries were in great distress. For the fam-

 ine was grievous in all lands, reaching even to the land of

Canaan, where Jacob and his sons lived.

_ 2. And Jacob sent them into Egypt to buy corn of Joseph;
but they little thought that he was the poor boy, their
brother, whom they had so long before sold for a slave.

3. But he knew them, and was glad; yet he thought it i

right at first to treat them roughlyl, and order them to prison

, as spies, that he might bring them to repentance for their

former crimes, and learn from them a true report of his
father and Benjamin, whom, as he did. not see him with
them, he might think they had put to death. ‘

4. In this distress they remembered their former cruelty,
and said, VVe are verily guilty concerning our brother. For,
when persons are in trouble, they reflect upon their sins, and
are sorry for them. Joseph, hearing this, could not keep
from tears, but went out from them, and wept.

5. At length, after several more trials, his brother Judah

came near to him, and said—-“ Oh, my lord, let thy servant,
I pray thee speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine
anger burniagainst thy servant‘, for thou art even as Pha’ra6h

6. “ My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father,
or a]l()iro—ther’! (i/Ind }V1t7i3dSa;dh1lnt()1(iny lord,1W1e3 have a fashler,
an o man, an a c 1' o is 0 age, a itte one; an is
brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his
father loveth him.

7. “ And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down
unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. And we said
unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for, if he
should leave his father, his father would die. -

8. “ And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your
youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my
face no more. And it came to pass, when we came up unto
thy servant my father we told him the words of my lord.

9. “And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little
food. And we said, We cannot go down. If our youngest
brother be with us, then will we go down ; for we may not
see the man’s face except our youngest brother be with us.

10. “ And thy servant, my father, said unto us, Ye know
that my wife bare me two sons; and the one went out from
me, andI said, Surely he is torn in pieces, and I have not
seen him since: and if ye take this also from me, and mis’-
chief befall him ye shall bring down my gray hairs with
sorrow to the graive.

11. “Now, therefore, when I come to thy servant, my
father, seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life, it
shall come to pass, when he seéth that the lad is not with
us, that he will die; and thy servants shall bring down the
gray hairs of thy servant, our father, with sorrow to the grave.

12. “ For thy servant became suretyl for the lad unto my
father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear
the blame to my father for ever.

y 13. “Now, therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide, i
instead’ of the lad, a bondman to my lord, and let the lad go

up with his brethren. For how shall I go up to my father,
and the lad be not with me? lest, peradverrtureg, I see the
evilthat shall come upon my father.”

14. And Joseph could refrain no longer, but iiiadehimself
known to his brethren, saying, “I am Joseph.” And when
they were greatly troubled at the thoughts of what they had

done, and afraid lest he would punish them, he kindly com-
forted them, by reminding them of the good which God had

‘ V brought out of their evil deed in selling him into Egypt.

.15. VVhen he had made a feast for his brethren, and given
them many presents, he sent them back to fetch their father,
their wives, and their little ones, their ﬂocks and herds, and
all their substance, to dwell with him in the land of Egypt.

16. But théugh he had so kindly forgiven them himself,
he could not forget what sort of spirit they had formerly
shown, and feared lest they should quarrel with and upbraid
one another for their cruelty to him, and accuse thoseiito
their father who had been most guilty; therefore he sent
them ofl""with this kind advice, “ See that ye fall not out by
the way.” i '

17. Jacob, at ﬁrst, could not believe that Joseph was
alive; but when he saw the presents, and the wag’ons which
he had sent to carry their goods, he was ﬁlled with joy, and
set out to join his long-lost son. 18. And he lived many
years in Egypt under the care of Joseph, who also was good
to all his brethren, whom he settled in the land of G6’shen,

- where there was much pz”is’ture1 for their cattle.

19. Thus Jacob had been greatly mistaken, when he
grieved so much for the loss of Joseph. For, while he
thought he had been dead, he was only sent into another
country, to provide for preserving his father’s life, and to do
good to many nations. 20. Thus God sees not as man sees.
'We can only see a little way before us ; but God sees every
thing that will happen. 21. We ought not, then, to grieve
for our afllictions, as if there were9 none to help us, but wait
with patience for the end of things, and trust in God that the
end will be good to those who do their duty.

LESSON XX.
The River J5r’dan.-—-—CHA'rEAUBRIAND3.

1. I WAS desirous of seeing the Jordan at the place where
it discharges, itself into the Dead Sea; but the Arabs refused
to conduct me to it, because the river, near its mouth, turns
off to the left, and approaches the mountains of Arabia. I
was,'therefore, obliged to make up my mind to proceed to the
curve of the river that was nearest to us. 2. We broke up

our camp, and advanced, for an hour and a half, with exces-
sive difficulty, over a ﬁne white sand. We were1 approach-
ing a grove of balm trees and tamarinds, which, to my great
astonishment, I perceived in the midst of this sterile? tract.
3. The Arabs all at once stopped, and pointed to something
that I had not yet remarked at the bottom of the ravinei’.
Unable to make out What it was, I perceived what appeared
to be sand in motion. 4. On drawing nearer to this singular
object, I beheld a yellow current, which I could scarcely
distinguish from the sands on its shores. It was deeply sunk
below its banks, and its sluggish stream rolled slowly on.
This was the Jordan.

5. I had surveyed the great rivers of America with that
pleasure, which solitude and“ nature impart; I had visited
the Tiber with enthusiasm, and sought, with the same inter-

‘est, the Ef1r6’tas and the Céphis’us ; but I cannot express

what I felt at the sightof the Jordan. 6. Not only did this
river remind me of a renowned antiquity, but its shores like-
wise presented to my view the theatre of the miracles of my
religion. 7. Judea is_ the only country in the World, that

revives in the traveller the memory of human affairs, and of ‘

celestial things, and which, by this combination, produces in
the soul a feeling and ideas, which no other region is capable
of exciting. ‘

8. The Arabs stripped, and plunged into the Jordan. I
dared not follow their example, on account of the fever by
which I was stilltormented; but I fell upon my knees on
the bank, with my two servants, and the drogoman"" of the
morﬁistéry. _ I took up some water from the river in a leathern
vessel : it did not seem to me as sweet as sugar, according to
the expression of a pious missionary. 9. I thought it, on the
contrary, rather brackish ; but, though I drank a considerable
quantity, I felt no inconvenience from it_: nay, I eventhink

it would be very pleasant, if it were puriﬁed from the ,_sand.

I9. About two leagues from the place Where we halted, I
perceived, higher up the river, a thicket of considerable ex-
tent. I determined to proceed thither, for I calc,uLla.ted that
thismust be nearly the spot where the Is’raelitesw?passed the
river, facing Jericho, where the man’na ceased to. fall, where

Christ was baptized by St. John. 11. Towards this place
we advanced, but as we drew near to it, we heard the voices
of men in the thicket. Unfortunately the human voice,
which cheers you every where else, and which you would
love to hear on the banks of the Jordan, is precisely what
most alarms you in these deserts. 12. The Bethlehemites
and the drogoman proposed an immediate retreat; but I
declared that I had not come so far, t.o be in such a hurry to
return; that I agreed to go no higher up the river; but that
I was determined to examine the river facing the spot were
we then stood. -

13. They yielded with reluctance to my resolution, and
we again repaired -to the bank of the Jordan, which a bend
of the river had carried to some distance from us on the right
I found it of the same width and depth as a league lower
down, that is, six or seven feet deep close to‘ the shore, and
about ﬁfty paces in breadth.

LESSON -XXI.
The Lz'0n.i“
1. A LION of the largest size measures from eight to nine
feet from the muzzle to the origin of the tail, which last is

of itself about four feet long. The height1 of the larger spé’ci-
mens is four or ﬁve feet. 2. The smallest-sized are about

_ ﬁve feet and a halflong, and three and a half in height, with

the tail proportionally short. The lioness,‘ in all its dimen-

. sions, is about one fourth less than the lion, and wants the
mane. ' I ’

3. The form and gait of this striking quad’ruped‘~3 are bold
and majestic. His head is large, his ears are rounded, his

v eye-brows ample, his eye-balls round and ﬁery, and‘ glowing,

on. the least irritation, -with peculiar lustre. 4. His chest is
shaggy, his tail bushy at the extremity, and a yellowish-brown
mane, nearly two feet long, flows on the sides of his head
and neck. His predominant colour is pale-tawny, with a
lighter shade, approaching to white, on the ﬂanks and belly.
5. The structure of his frame, and his astonishing move-
ments, bespeak a singular combination of bones, nerves, and
mus’cles, destined to‘-act with wonderful effect in pursuing

and destroying the creatures on which he feeds. -6. Not» I

withstanding his portly dimensions, he is so far from appear-
ing clumsy or unwieldy, that he may justly be regarded as a
model1 of strength and activity. 7. When provoked, he
erocts his mane, darts fire from his eye-balls, contracts the
muscles of his cheeks and forehead into hid’eous wrinkles,
shows his formidable teeth, and exhib’its a spectacle of savage
grandeur, which beggars description. 8. His piercing eyes
are furnished with a mem’brane, which he can extend over
them at pleasure, and which, perhaps, has given V rise to the
common opinion, that he always sleeps with his eyes open.
9. His teeth, which are disposed like those of the cat, are
extremely hard; his jaws are large and strong; and ‘the
prickles of his tongue are sufﬁciently sharp to la’cerate the
skin of most animals. 10. As he puts his mouth to the
ground when he roars, the sound is equally propagated to a
considerable distance on all sides, so that it is impossible to
discover the precise’ spot whence it issues. 11. This cir-
cumstance increasing the alarm, the intimidated animals ﬂy
backwards and forwards; and, in the dark, they often run
to the very place from which the noise’ proceeds, and which
they are so anxious to avoid.

12. The lion isa native of the hottest parts of Asia, but
more abounds in the interior of Africa, exercising his reign?
over the weaker quadrupeds. '

13. His habitation is usually in the thickest part of the
forest; and he is seldom seen by day, as too much light is
apt to incommode him; but, on the approach of night, he
quits his den, and prowls about for prey, roaring hideously,
and terrifying most of the animals within his hearing. 14. A
single stroke of his paw will break a horse’s neck ; the sweep
of his tail will throw a strong man on the ground; and he
can carry off, with apparent ease, a middle-sized ox, or even
a buffalo, when lightened of its entrails. 15. He does3 not
openly attack any animal, unless provoked, or oppressed with
hunger ; but, in the latter case, he is said to fear no danger,
and to be repelled by no resistance. 16'? His usual method
of taking his prey is, to spring, or throw himself ‘on it, with
one vast bound, from the place of his concealment : if, how-
ever, he miss his aim, he seldom attempts another spring at
the same object, but d‘e4l=ibera.tely returns to the thicket in
which he lay in ambush. 17.».-Vflien‘ he seizes his victim,

, he knocks it down, and seldom bites. it till‘ he inflicts tliie

mortal blow, which he generally accompanies with a tremen-
dous4 roar. He seems to prefer the flesh of a -Hottentotto

40 INTRODUCTION TO THE

that of a European, probably because the former is not en
curnbered with clothes. 18. The horse, next to the H0tten-
tot, is reputed his favourite prey; and the elephant and
camel are both highly relished; while the sheep, owing,
probably, to its woolly ﬂeece, is seldom molested. With his
strong teeth he breaks bones with the greatest ease; and
he often swallows their fragments along with the ﬂesh.
19. ‘When enraged, or goaded by famine, he rears his mane,
and beats his tail against his back and sides, when it is
extremely hazardous to approach him; but when the mane
and tail are at. rest, and the animal is in a placid mood,
travellers may generally pass pretty near to him in perfect
safety.

20. The female, though physically weaker, and, for the
most part, more timid than the male, is more ferocious than
he in defence of her young; making her incursions with
greater boldness, destroying every animal that falls in her
way, and carrying it, reeking, to her offspring. 21. When
attacked in their presence, she seems to be insensible to her
own Wounds; and, with her head to the ground, and her
eyes ﬁxed on her assailants, she seldom fails either to save
her progeny, or to perish in the conflict.

 

LESSON XXII.
The Tiger.

1. THE term tiger, in the Armenian language, is said lite-
rally to signify an arroro, and denotes the rapidity with which
the animal, so denominated, bounds or darts on its prey.
2. The length of this quadruped, from the upper part of the
forehead to the origin of the tail, is about nine feet, and the
height about four or five feet, which is, also, the length of

the tail. 3. The prevailing colour of the body is a deep

tawny, or orange-yellow; the face, throat, and lower part
of the belly, are nearly White; and the Whole is traversed by
numerous long black stripes, forming a bold and striking
contrast with the ground colour.

4. The tiger is a native of Asia, occurring from China and
Chinese Tartary to Armenia, but chieﬂy frequent’ing the hot
climates of India and the Indian Islands, particularly the
hilly and wooded districts; lurking in jungles and thickets.
from which it issues to spread its ravages all around, attack-

ing the ﬂocks and herds, unterriﬁed by the sight or resistance

of man, and closing even with the lion in such ﬁerce en- -

counters, that the com’batants1 have. been known‘ to fall
together. 5. ‘When undisturbed, the tiger plunges his head
into the body of his victim, and quaffs large draughts of

blond, the sources of which are generally exhausted before

his thirst is allayed. So prodigious, too, is his muscular
strength, that he is capable of carrying off a dead buffalo, of
nearlyidouble the weight of a common ox. 6. In his native
wilds, he conceals himself from view, and springs on his prey
with a most hideous roar; but, if he miss his aim, he is apt,
like the lion, to shrink away, without repeating the attempt.
'7. Though he seldom makes an open attack on any creature
that is capable of resistance, he seems to prefer men, when

- he can procure them by surprise, to any other prey. 8. In

some parts of India, tigers are particularly. fatal to wood-
cutters and labourers about the forests ; and they have even
been seen to swim out to boats at anchor, at a little distance
from the shore, and drag 05' the men from on board. 9. As
in Java they frequently carry 05 travellers, when any person

i of consequence goes out into the country, he is attended by

men, who incessantly blow a sort of small French horns, the
shrill sound of which is said to frighten them entirely away.
10. The number of persons killed by tigers, every year, in
Sigma/tra, is almost incredible; for there whole villages have
at times been depopulated by them; whilst ideas of supersti-
tion, connected with the doctrine of transmigration, render
the natives very remiss in their endeavours to destroy them.
1_l. The roar of the tiger is said to be tremendous, com-
mencing with, deep, slow, and melancholy inﬂections, then

becoming more acute, and terminating in aviolent cry, in-V

iterrupted by long, tremulous intonations, which distract— the

imagination, especially when these roarings, which are utter-

ed chieﬂy in the night, are reverberated by the echoes of the

mountains. 12. When. robbed of her young, the rage of the
female knows no bounds; and, braving every danger, she
will pursue the plunderer to the sea-shore, or into the gates
of cities; and, when the hope of recovering her offspring is
lost, she expresses her grief and indignation by the most fear-
ful hiowlings. . .   '
 Neither gentleness nor constraint‘ has, it is alleged,

hitherto ‘succeeded in taming the full grown tiger, which

LESSON XXIII.
The Alligator and the Tz.'ger.’*

I. THE bosom? of the river was extremely tranquil, and the
heat, which was i11tol’erable, had made us so languid, that
almost a general wish overcame us, on the approach of the
evening, to bathe in the waters of the Congo. 2. Johnson
and myself, however, were deter’red from it by the appre-
hension of sharks, many of which, and those en6r’mously
large, we had observed in the progress of our voy’age.

3. At length, Campbell alone, who had been making too
free with his liquor3-case, was ob’stinately bent on going
overboard ; and, although we used every means in our power
to persuade him to the con’trary, he dashed into the river,
and had swum some dis’tance from the vessel, when we, on
the deck, discov’ered an alligator making towards him from
behind a rock, that stood a little way from the shore.

4. His escape’ I now considered impossible, his destruc-
tion iné’vitable; and I asked Johnson what we should do.
He, like myself, thought it impossible to save him, and in-
stantly seized a loaded musket, to shoot the poor fellow
before he should fall into the jaws of the monster.

5. I did not, however, consent to this, but waited with
horror to see the tragedy that we ant‘1”cipated. Yet, willing
to do all in my power, I ordered the boat to be let down, and
we ﬁred two shot at the approaching alligator, but without any
effect. 6. They glanced off’ from his scales like hailstones

atom a slated roof, and the pr6’gress of the creature was by

no means impeded. _
'7. The report of the pieces, and the noise of the blacks

-from the sloop, soon made‘ Campbell acquainted with his

danger. He saw the creature pursuing him, and, with all
the strength and skill that he was master of, he made for the
shore.

8. And now the moment arrived, in which a scene was

exhibited beyond the power of my pen iid’equately to dé-_

scribe’.
9. As our friend approached within a very short distance

of some canes and shrubs, that covered the river’s bank, the
alligator being close upon his heels, a ﬁerce tiger, that was
crouching in the reeds, sprung towards him, at the instant
that the jaws of his first enemy were open to devour him.

10. This was’ an awful moment for Campbell :——-but he
was preserved! The tiger, in his eagerness, leaping over him,
encountered the gripe of the amphib’ious monster. A dread-
ful conﬂict ensued. 11. The water was coloured with the
blood of the tiger, whose efforts to tear the scaly covering of
the alligator were unavailing ; while the latter had also the
advantage of keeping his adversary under water, by which
the victory was soon declared in the alligator’s favour.

12. They both sunk to the bottom, and we saw no more
of either. Campbell was taken into the boat, and instantly
conveyed on board. He spoke not, while in the boat, al-
though his fright had completely sobered him. 13. But, the
moment he leaped on the deck, he fell on his knees, and
returned thanks to the Pr6v’idence that had so wonderfully
delivered him from his danger; and, what is most singular,
from that moment to the time I am writing, liehas never
been seen in the least intoxicated, nor has he been heard to
utter a single oath. If there ever was a man perfectly re-
formed, Campbell is the man.

LESSON XXIV. _
The Elephant.——ANEcDo'rEs on ANIMALS.

1. THE elephant, a native of Asia and Africa, is the
largest, the strongest, the most saga’cious, and the most
do’cile of all wild beasts. The usual height of this unsightly
creature is from eight to twelve or fourteen feet. 2. The
colour is nearly black; the eyes, which are very small, are
lively, bright, and expressive ; the ears are broad, and much
longer, in proportion to the body, than those of the ass.

3. It has two long ivory tusks, thicker toward the head
than a stout man’s arm, and a trunk, which it can contractor
lengthen, as need requires. 4. The latter is as useful to the
animal as our hands are to us. With this singular organ it
can take up the smallest object; it serves itself with it ; land,
in case of an attack, ﬁghts with it. It can also untie knots
of ropes, and open and shut gates. _ -

l 5. The legs of this st.upen’dous quad’ruped “are like col-‘
umns of from twelve to eighteen inches in diameter, and from

44 INTRODUCTION TO THE

four to six feet high. The feet are short, and divided into
five toes each, and are armed with nails of a horny substance,
but which are so covered with skin, that they are scarcely
visible.

6. The elephant, in a state of nature, is neither ﬁerce nor
mischievous. It is peaceable, mild, and brave; and exerts
its powers only in its own defence, or in defence of those of
its own kind, with which it is social and friendly.

7. Elephants often assemble in large troops; and as they
march, which is mostly in quest of food, the forests seem to
tremble under them. In their passage they bear down-the
branches of trees, which, together with roots, herbs, and
leaves, are their common food: they have no objection,
however, to grain and fruit, but will not eat either fish or
flesh. 8. In a state of captivity, they will drink ale, wine,
and sprituous liquors; fcr which, indeed, they seem to have
a particular predilection.

9. The elephant is thirty years old..bef'ore it attains its full
growth. The young animal sucks with its trunk, and when-
ever the dam Wants to cross a river with it, she takes it up
in her trunk, and carries it safely over.

18. Elephants are always caught by a regular kind of ‘

stratagem, in which art the natives are very expert. When
once tamed, they are the most gentle, obedient, and patient,
as well as the most do’cile and sagacious, of all quadrupeds.
Their attachment to their masters is remarkable, and they
seem to live but to serve and obey them. 11. They know
their voices, and also whether they speak in anger or in good
humour, and regulate their own actions accordingly. They
will caress those with whom they are acquainted, and are
quickly taught t.o kneeledown to receive their riders, or any
load which they may have to carry.

1'2. The common pace or walk of the elephant is not
quicker than that of a horse; but, when pushed, it assumes a
kind of arnbling pace, which in fleetness is nearly equal to a
gallop; but it has great difficulty in turning, and, therefore,
requires a pretty large circuit for the purpose.

13. ‘Whether they live longer in their wild, or their do-
mestic state, is uncertain. The common age of the tame
ones is from a hundred to a hundred and thirty or forty
years.

14. This animal, if not the most useful, is one ofthe most

* wonderful in the brute creation; being, as an eminent autnor

expresses himself, “a monster of matter, and a miracle of

NATIONAL READER. 45

intelligence.” 15. Heis sometimes seized with a kind of
phrensy, which renders him extremely formidable; so that,
on the first symptoms of madness, he is commonly killed to
prevent mischief: yet, in these fits, he has often been known
to distinguish his benefactor : so strongly are gratitude and
magnanimity impressed on the nature of this astonishing
mass of animated matter. '

LESSON XXV.’
Anecdotes of the EIep7e.ant.—-THE SAME.

1. AMONG several well authenticated anecdotes of the ele-
phant, we are told, that one of those which was used by the
French forces in India for drawing their cannon, was prom-
ised, by his conductor, a reward for having performed some
painful service; but, being disappointed of the expected re-
muneration, and impatient of being thus mocked, he instantly
slew the offender in a fury. 2. The conductor’s wife, who
was a spectator of this shocking scene, could not restrain her
madness and despair; but instantly running with her two
children in her arms, threw them at the elephant’s feet, cry-
ing out, “Since thou hast killed my husband, kill me and».
my children also.” 3. The elephant, seeing the children at
his feet, immediately stopped, as if stung with remorse, and
took up the elder boy with his trunk, and placed him upon
his neck, whom he then adopted for his conductor, and
obeyed ever after with great punctuality.

4. A soldier of Pondicher’ry, who frequentiy carried.‘ an
elephant a certain measure of arrack, being one day a little
intoxicated, and seeing himself pursued by the guard, whose
orders, he knew, were to conduct him to prison, took refuge
under the elephant. The guard, soon ﬁnding his retreat,
attempted in vain to take him ‘ from his asylum; for the ele-
phant vigorously defended him with his trunk. 5. As soon
as the soldier became sober, seeing himself placed under
such an unwieldy animal, he was so terriﬁed, that he scarcely
dared to move either hand or foot; but the elephant soon
caused his fears to subside, by caressing him with his trunk,
and thus tacitly saying, “,Depart in peace.”

6. “One evening,” says the author of the Child’s Monitor,
“being invited to see the elephant fed that belonged to Mr.
Piddock, in Scarborough, with the beasts accompanying him,
I readily accepted the invitation. 7. About nine o’clock,

46 INTRODUCTION To TI-IE

one of the persons in waiting offered the elephant a pail of
water; the creature, when unprovoked, very courteously

put his trunk over the rail in the front of his apartment, to .

take up the pail, when the man lowered it, and disappointed
him; he did the same a second time; and, in handing it
up a third time, the twice-deceived animal. gave the fellow
such a stroke over one side of the head with his trunk, that
it made him reel to and fro like a drunken man. 8. The
company laughed so audibly at the unexpected revenge, that
i believe the offender will never more attempt to amuse
any company in the same manner, lest he should meet with
a similar return.”

 A painter was desirous of drawing an elephant in an
unusual attitude, with his trunk erect, and his mouth open;
and, in order to induce the beast to show himself to more
advantage, engaged a person to stand by, and throw fruit
into his mouth. 10. The person, however, partly to amuse
himself, and partly to deceive the unsuspecting animal, often
kept in his hand the fruit which he pretended to give to the
elephant; who, not liking the mockery, and supposing the
innocent painter to be the cause, threw out of his trunk- such
a quantity of -Water upon his paper, as entirely spoiled his
sketch, and prevented him from proceeding in his work.

11. Some years ago, an elephant was passing a tailor’s
workshop, and, seeing part of the window open, put the end
of his trunk within the room; upon which one of the tailors,
wishing to have a little sport at the expense of the harmless
L’)ru«te, pricked the trunk with his needle. 12. The animal,
resolving to avenge this unprovoked insult, went in search
of some dirty water, which he soon found, and with which
he ﬁlled his trunk; then returned to the shop, and, ﬁnding
the window open, as before, directed his trunk to the open
part, and spouted. out the contents upon the offender and his
companions, who no doubt had enjoyed the shop-board

' prank, and then took his farewell, leaving the poor drenched

tailors to reflect upon theejustness of the revenge.

13. “I .was,” says Mr. Phillipe, “ an eye-witness to the
following facts :——At Goa there are always some elephants
employed in the building of ships. I one day went to the
side of the river, near which a great one was building, where
there is a large area ﬁlled with ‘beams for that purpose.
14. Some men tie the endsof the heaviest with arope, which

after: twisting it round his trunk, draws it, without any con-

ductor, to the place where the ship is building, though it may
only once have been pointed out to him. 15. One of these
sometimes drew beams so large, that twenty men would have
been unable to move them. But, what surprised me still
more, when other beams obstructed the read, he elevated the
ends of his own beams, that they might run easily over those
which lay in his way. Could the most enlightened man do
more T” .

16. At Ma’hié, on the coast of Malabar’, Mr. Toreen’ tells
us, he had an opportunity of admiring the sagacity of an ele-
phant. Its master had let it for a certain sum per day; its
employment was to carry, with its trunk, timber for a build~
ing, out of the river; which business it despatched very dex-
terousiy, under the command of a boy, and afterwards laid
the pieces one upon another, in such exact order, that no
man could have done it better.

17. In many parts of India, the elephants are made the ex-
ecutioners ofjustice; for they will, with their trunks, break
every limb of a criminal, trample him to death, or transﬁx
him with their tusks, as they are directed.

18. In India, they were once employed in the launching of
ships 2 one was directed to force a very large vessel into the
water: the work proved superior to his strength: his mag-
ter, with a sarcastic tone, said, “Keeper, take away this lazy
beast, and bring another :” the poor animal instantly repeated
his efforts, fractured his skull, and died on the spot.

19. In the Philosophical Transactions, a story is related of
an elephant’s having such an attachment for a very young
child, that he was never happy but when it was near him.
The nurse used, therefore, very frequently, to take the child
in its cradle, and place it betwixt his feet. 2;‘). To this he
became, at length, so much accustomed, that he would never

eat his food except when the child was present. VVhen it
slept, he used to drive off the flies with his pr6bos"cis, or »

trunk, and when it cried, he would I move the cradle back-
wards and forwards, and thus again rock it to sleep.

21. A sentinel, belonging to the present rnéna’gerié at
Paris, was always very careful in requesting the spectators
not to give the elephants any thing to eat. This conduct par-
ticularly displeased the female, who beheld him with a very
unfavourable eye, and hiid several times endeavoured to cor-
rect his interfé’rence, by besprinkling his head with Water
from her trunk. 22. One day, when several persons were
collected to view these animals, a hy’stander* oﬂhred the fe-

male :1 bit of bread ; the sentinel proscribed it, but the mo-
ment he opened his mouth to give the usual admonition, she
placing herself immediately before him, discharged in his face
a considerable stream of water. 23. A general laugh en-
sued’; but the sentinel, having calmly wiped his face, stood
a little on one side-, and continued as vigilant as before. Soon
afterwards, he found himself under the necessity of repeating
his admonition to the spectators; but no sooner was this ut-
tered, than the female lai_d hold of his musket, twirled it round
with her trunk, trod it uiider her feet, and did not restore it
till s_he_had twisted it into, the form of a screw.

24. it has been observed that dogs, though entirely unac-
quainted with lions, will tremble and shudder at their roar;
and an elephant that has never seen a tiger will, in the same
manner, show the strongest symptoms of horror and affright
at the smell of it. 25. The late Lord Clive exhibited a com-
bat.‘ between t.wo of these animals at Calcutta ; but the scent
of the tiger had such an effect upon the elephant, that nothing‘3
could either force or allure him to go along the road, where
the cage in which it was enclosed had passed, till a gallon of
arraokii‘ was given him, when, his horror suddenly turning
into fury, he broke down the paling to get at his enemy, and
killed him without difficulty.

26. _Mr. Hervey, having occasion to purchase an elephant,
was offered a most majestic one, in point of size,*at a very
low price ; but he declined the bargain,on account of a wound
the creature had received in the trunk, from the cruel ra.<:«:h-
ness of its keeper, by which it was greatly disﬁgured. and
entirely disabled from the functions that member usually per-
forms. 27. It hung down, as if incapable of motion, and had
lost the power of suction, or of grasping ; consequently, the
poor elephant was deprived of the power of procuring his
own subsistence, and was wholly dependent on the attention
of others. 28. In this pitiable situation, one of its own spe-

cies, a male elephant, sympathized in its distress, compassion-

ated its sufferings, and constantly prepared for it bunches of
grass, and fresh leaves, and put them into his mouth.

29. Can any thing be more amiable than this conduct, or
more similar to an act of reason’! Rats are said to show a
degree of pity and sagacity nearly equal, in case of one of

‘ their community’s becoming blind?” they have been seen to

and a rat at each end of it, to guide their companion to the
water.

30. An elephant, which, a ‘few years ago, belonged to Mr.
Cross at Exeter ’Change, attained to the practice of a curious
trick, which, by repetition, might be said to have acquired, if,
indeed, instinct could be acquired, something of an instinctive
character ; but which, the first time it occurred, at least, seems
attributable to nothing short of reason. 31. It is the usual
part of the performance of an elephant at a public exhibition,

to pick up a piece of coin, thrown within his reach for the '

purpose, with the ﬁnger-like appendage at the extremity of
the trunk. On one occasion a sixpence was thrown, which
happened to roll a little out of the reach of the animal, not far
from the wall. 32. Being desired to pick it up, he stretched
out his proboscis several times to reach it; he then stood mo-
tionless for a few seconds, evidently considering-—we have
no hesitation in saying evidently considering——h0w to act.
 He then stretched his proboscis in a straight line as far as
he could, a little distance above the coin, and blew with great
force against the wall; the angle produced by the opposition
of the wall, made the current of air act under the coin, as he
evidently supposed that it would '; and it was curious to ob-
serve thesixpence travelling towards the animal, till it came
within his reach, and he picked it up. 34. This complicated
calculation of natural means at his disposal, was an intellect-
ual eﬁiort beyond what a vast number of human beings would
ever have thought of; and it would be considered as a lucky
thought, a clever expedient, under similar circumstances in
any man. -

35. Some young camels were travelling withthe British
army, when they had occasion to cross the Jumna in ﬂat-bot-
tomed boats. The novelty of the thing‘ excited their fears to
such a degree, that it seemed impossible to lead or drive
them into the boats, upon which one of the mohouts, or
elephant keepers, called to his elephant, and desired him to
drive them in. 35. The animal immediately put on a furi-
ous appearance, trumpeted with his pr6b6s’cis, shook his
ears, roared, struck the ground to the right and left, and blew
the dust in clouds towards them; and so effectually subdued
one great fear in the refractory camels, by exciting a greater,
that they bolted into the boat in the greatest hur%—when

50 INTRODUCTION TO THE

LESSON XXVI.
The 0a;.—THE SAME.

I OXEN is the general name given to horned cattle.
These animals differ much in size. A large, full grown bul-
lock is usually about ﬁve feet in height, and seven feet in
length, from its forehead to the end of its back. It has
a stout head, ‘bulky body, long tail, and rather short legs.
2.,The skin is tough‘, and covered with thick, soft ha.ir.
The ox is of a sluggish nature, very strong, yet gentle.
There are oxen in all parts of the world. Tho-se of Egypt,
about the river Nile, are as white as snow, and of a very
large size. '

 The cow is the female of the animal before mentioned.
She resembles the bull in shape and appearance, except that
her head is smaller; and some cows are without horns.

4. The cow, perha.p-s, is more useful to mankind than any
other animal. In fact, she has, with great propriety, been
called our second mother, because she supplies us with such
great quantities of milk, from the use of which mankind in
general, but particularly children, derive the greatest nourish»
ment. The milk, when churned, is made into butter; and,
when curdled, is pressed into cheese. ,

5. These animals are of various coloursg: they also
differ much in the appearance of their heads; and some have
short, while others have long horns, with which they can
easily toss up into the air a large dog, or other weighty
thing. i

6. The flesh of these animals affords that most nutri’tious
food called beef, so much valued and desired by mankind at
large. Their skins, when properly prepared, become leath-
er3, which serves for boots, shoes, and many other useful pur-
poses. 7. Of their horns are made combs, boxes, handles for

‘knives, and drinking vessels; and,jwhen softened and cut

thin, they are used to make the transparent ‘sides of lanterns.
8. The large bones are used to form many articles, which, in
the whiteness of their appearance, nearly resemble ivory, and
the small bones produce an oil, which is much used to clean

harness, and -the trappings belonging to a coach. 9. Their "

blood is an excellent manure’ for fruit‘-trees, and is the chief
ingredi,%1t employed in manufacturing that ﬁne colour called

’ Prussian blue; it is also much used in reﬁning sugar.

10. Glue is made of the gristles and ﬁner pieces of cuttings
and parings of the hides, boiled in water till they are reduced
to a jelly, and then dried. 11. In short, the blood, fat, mar-
row, skin, hair, horns, hoofs, liv’er, gall, bones, and milk,
have all their particular uses in manufactures, commerce,
and medicine.

12. The natural dwelling places of these animals are
the ﬁelds, which supply them plentifully with various kinds
of grass and herbage, on which they contentedly feed.
13. There they ru’minate, or chew the cud: in other words,
after they-have swallowed the grass down into their stom-
achs, it rises up, and returns into their mouths, where they
slowly chew it over again. 14. Oxen have two kinds of
voices: the one is called lowing, which is a moderate sound;
the other is called bellowing, which is a roaring noise.

LEssoN XXVII.
The furious Bull subdued ‘by I{z'na7ness.—-THE SAME.

1. A FARMER had a bull, so wild and ferocious that he was
kept constantly chained, except when led to water, at which
time he was never suﬁ"ered to be out ofthe hands of a trusty
person. 2. This animal seemed to have conceived a partic-
ular antip’athy against the farmer’s brother, who assisted him
in his business, and had probably irritated him on some occa-
sion, without being aware of the consequences. 3. He never
saw him approach the open shed in which he was kept, with-
out beginning to bellow most dreadfully, which he continued
as long as the object of his dislike was in view; at the same
time tearing up the earth with his horns, and showing every
symp’tom of the utmost aversion. 4. On two occasions,
he very cunningly watched an opportunity, while his keeper
was leading him to water, and made a sudden spring at his
enemy, who was standing in the yard.

5. Wliilst the bull was under the inﬂuence of this hostility
and resentment, one of the most tremendous thunder-storms,

ever remembered. in the country, occurred. The lightning

resembled sheets of ﬁre, and each ﬂash was instantly suc-
ceeded by a thunder-clap, as loud as if a volley of ten thou-
sand cannon had been discharged. 6. The pit’eous roarings
of the bull, during this convulsion of the elements, were quite

’aﬁ’ecting. Being exposed, in an open shed, to all the fury of
.. the storm, he sent forth, every instant, a yell of terror, hid’e-

52 INTRODUCTION TO THE

ous beyond description. '7. Imagining that it was the light-
ning that chieﬂy alarmed the animal, the farmer proposed to
the men-servants to go and remove him into the barn, but in
vain; they were so much terriﬁed at their own danger, that
the roarings of the bull made no impression upon them, nor
could any of them be persuaded to move. 8. The farmer’s
brother, who was a humane, generous young man, undertook
the task; facing at once the double danger of the lightning,
and the fury of the bull. He accordingly put on his great
coat, and went into the yard. 9. The moment he approach-
ed the bull, which he found lying, trembling, on his back,
having almost torn his chain through the gristle of his nose,
in his eﬁorts to get loose, he rose, and, by his fawning ac-
tions, expressed the delight he felt at the sight of any thing
human, amidst such a scene of terror. 10. Fear had disarm-
ed him of his feifﬂcity. Witli the utmost quietness he suf-
fered himself to be untied, and led to the barn, by the very
man whom, a few hours before, he would have torn in
pieces, if he could have got at him. i

11. The next morning, as his deliverer was crossing the
yard, he remarked that the bull, which had been placed in
his shed, no longer saluted him with his accustomed bellow.
It struck him that the animal might remember his kindness
to him the night before. 12. He accordingly ventured, by
degrees, to approach him; and found that now, so far from
showing any dislike to him, he suffered him, with the utmost
gentleness, to scratch his head. From that very day, he con-
tinued, to him, as tame as a lamb; sufiering him to play all
manner of tricks with him, which no other person about the
farm dared attempt, and seeming even to take pleasure in
being noticed by him.

LESSON XXVIH.
Chase of the wild Oz in Soutlz Amerz'ca.*

1. AFTER a ride of three or four miles on a large open
plain, we found about four hundred head of cattle. We rode
gently round, to bring them into a more compact’ body, and
ignade the animal, which was to be chased, distinctly known
‘to every individual of the party. 2. Our settled object was-
to drive him to the house; and, to render the sport as com-

plete as possible, the lasscfll‘ was not to be used until there
“appeared a probability that he would otherwise escape.
3. Seine of the people then dashed into the midst of the herd,
attentively observing the selected animal. One half of the
e.'~:en were thus driven at once from the spot, and others,

Vwhicli chose to do so, were permitted to follow without mo-

lestation; but, wherever the victim turned, a horseman met
him, and stopped his career. .4. The work was easy until the
remaining group1 was reduced to about twenty, which then
made vioient attempts to rejoin their comradesg, and fiercely
attacked the huntsmen who intercepted them. 5. In a short
time, four of them, being hard pressed, plunged into some
w-.i*:ery ground, about two miles from the house, and among
them was the object of the chase. 6. When driven from the
water, this small number were more harass’ed than before,
and, perceiving their danger, exerted themselves with redou-
bied violence. '7. Sometimes we wereobliged to ride hard;
and great «coolness and address were necessary to prevent
their escape behind us, and into a wood, which we were now
approaching. In this last respect, our efforts were vain : they
gained this refuge, and we could no longer act in concert.
8. The wood was full of thick bushes of myrtle3, and many
trees spread their arms horizontally seven or eight feet from
the ground. It was matter of high gratiﬁcation, as well as
wonder, to observe how our huntsmen rounded the bushes,
and bent under the branches, so as sometimes to hang on the
sides of their horses. 9. Though unable to follow, I soon
encountered our chief, who had made an unsuccessful cast
with his lasso, and was disentangling it from the branches of
a tree.’ 10. I shall never forget the ardour and rapidity, with
which he afterwards darted and wheeled among the trees;

and, on reaching the beach, I saw, at a distance, our young

* “ The lasso is made of narrow thongs, plaited in the same way as the bridles,
and is about seven or eight yards long. One end of it is ﬁrmly ﬁxed to the binder
part of the saddle, generally on the right side : at the other end is an iron ring,
about two inches in diameter. The horseman, about to use the lasso, forms a
sort of running-noose, by passing a portion of it through the ring; this is taken in
the right hand, so as that the ring may be at the opposite part of the circle; the
noose is then swung with care over the head, until the extreme part of it, inclu-
ding the ring, acquires a considerable force. The instrument, thus prepared, as
the main advances towards his selected victim, is in due time discharged,carries
oil‘ the remainder of the string, which before hung loosely in coils on the ﬁng.
of the left hand, and seldom fails to entangle the beast. A well-trained horse,
though at full speed, when the lasso is thrown, instantly stops, and turning round,

pulls against the animal, which is now attached to him."

h'ero,.,with tl1e§.‘_o3< securely attached to his horse by the lasso,
and leading the captive towards the house. Tl1e‘instrun1ent
had gone round his horns, and was fixed close to the crown
of his head. 11. The animal, thus entangled, advanced with
the most malicious vexation, and made many ferocious efl'orts
to gore the horse, which had before pursued, and now led
him; but the wary creature, which had often before been
yoked to an unnatural and violent ‘mate, kept his eye upon
the ex, and pulled at the lasso so as to keep it always on the

"stretch, and himselftwo springs in advance. 12. In his pre-

cautions he was greatly assisted’ by his rider, who, with equal
care, watched the maddening spirit of the beast, and gave
signals to the horse. Convinced, at length, that his attempts
to gore his leader were vain, the ox became sullen, and was
partly dragged onward. 13. ‘While he was in this mood, the

horse passed to the right of a detached bush, and the ox, by
A a sudden spring, got -nearly abreast of ‘him on the left: thus,
‘ ‘the lasso was brought over his back, and he was enabled to

employ his utmost might to draw the horse round the bush ;_
the horse also used" all his power to counteract this manoeu-
vrel; and thus the great strength of the lasso was proved.
14. By this time the whole party was again collected, and
another lasso applied to assist in conducting the captive,
which, seemingly conscious that he was completely subdued,
walked along quietly.‘ 15. A boat had just reached the
beach; and the people were still on board, when the treach-

erous animal, as soon as he came near enough, made an un-

expected attack, and caused them to tumble, one over anoth-
er, into the water, to the great amusement of the spectators.
16. Returning to the hut, after a chase of three hours,

"milk and fruitwere served to us in abundancegw-hile the

beast was taken from his former bondage, and tied to a post,
where I found him bellowing with madness, and still furi-

carving-knife and a short sword ; and, warning -every one to

oured, by a backhanded stroke, to houghg him. 18. The
attempt was clumsily made, and the beast, though wounded,

,yvas not disabled. Another took the instrument, and used
 with greater effect; when the ox gave a desperate kick at

the‘ operator, and, snapping the tendon, fell on his haunches3.

LESSON XXIX.
Against the Abuse of Cattle.-i--ORIGINAL.

1 IT was wisely said, by the wisest of kings, that a righte-
ous man regardeth the life of his beast; but that the tender
mercies of the wicked are cruel?‘ And yet it may be doubt-
ed whether there is any species of cruelty, or any kind of
wickedness whatever, more cornmonthan that which is here
reproved by Solomon. ‘2. We see man, on all sides of us,
and at all periods of his life, from childhood to old age, prac-
tically forgetting, or showing that he has never learned, that
a part of ‘righteousness consists in doing his duty to the brute
beasts, which the Maker of all things has subjected to his
power. ' " ' ' - 

3. That boy, whom, in the mind’s eye, we see in the

morning, ex’ercising himself in throwing clubs and stones, is .

throwing them at the cow that he is driving forth to pas-
ture. 4. And why does he treat her thus unmercifullyi
Does he feel that his time is valuable, or that it is short when
compared with his other duties, and that he, therefore, must
hasten her’? 5. 0 no :———it is a trial of his skill; he would
see how often he can hit her. It is a trial of his strength;

‘he would see with how large a stone he can reach her.

6. And now, having opened the gate, or the bars, he stands

‘by, with a stone or a club, to give her proof of his strength,

in a blow under which shemust pass. ._

'7. Stop, my boy! have you forgotten that this meek and

LESSON XXX.
The same ;S"u?gject.——THE SAME.

1.  that young ploughman. Vfith what vigour he plies
the lash! with what energy he urges the goad ! And why’!
Are not his oxen moving on with all their strength, and
turning overthe furrows as fast as they can be turned well?
2. Or has a rock, or the root of a “ gnarled oak,” stopped
the plough, so that it is beyond the power of his cattle to go
onward’? Perhaps either, perhaps neither, of these is the
case. 3. Perhaps, and quite as probably, the young man has
got a new whip; and its singing, as it goes through the air,
is music to his rustic ear : or he may have sharpened up his
goad, and is trying it: or, perhaps, like the man in the para-
ble, he has bought a yoke of oxen, and he must needs go out
and prove them.

4. Pause, then, young man ! let your plough stand a while
in its furrow. Lay down that instrument of ‘ torture, and come
forward, a moment, and do as you propose. Prove one of
these your oxen. 5. Look at this animal ! ‘With what strength
is his neck clothed! yet, see, how submissively he bows it
down to you, and how quietly he expends his strength in
your servicei 6. Could you plough your ﬁeld without him?
could you gather in your harvest without him’! could you

this skin of his, that you are so cruelly cutting,—-«this skin, by
which you are hereafter to be shod; nothing of these horns,
which, when taken from his head, where they are an emblem
of honour and strength, shall be transferred to the heads of

ing oflthis mass of ﬂesh, which shall hereafter smoke upon
your .tabl.e,3and become a part of your own ﬂesh :—but, look

at“*thes,e,,-eyes!——as you pat him kindly upon the shoulder,
how‘ generously they roll round upon you! what an expresue

~ sion is there in them, of quiet and benevolent dignity! 9. It

was intended as a compliment by the idolatrous Greeks, and
it was afgcomplimeiit, to the queen of their gods, when they
called he?“ the venerable, ox-eyed Juno.” Here is an eye, in
which you may see the benevolence of the true God, who
has made this animal your slave. 10. Consider, too, how
faithful a servant he is! how readily he rouses himself from
his rest at your bidding, and gives his days, and too often a
part of his nights, to your service! ll. And what does he
demand for all his patient and faithful toil’! Nothing but
that which will enable him still better to serve you--food,
shelter, rest, and kind usage. This is all he asks: and ought
he not to have this? 12. This is all: and, though his own
lips cannot plead for this reasonable return for his labours,
remember, God pleads for it in his stead,—pleads for it in
the look with which the dumb beast regards you,—pleads
for it in your own sense of dependence on his labours,—-
pleads for it in that. benevolent ordinance, which, of old, he
gave by Moses; “Thou shalt not muzzle the ox, when he
treadeth out the corn ;’’’'’-“——--and pleads for it, where, by his
holy prophet, he has declared, that “ he will judge between
the fat cattle and the lean cattle.”

13. “ What! then,” do you ask, “ doth God take care for
oxen T’ Assuredly he does. And, believe me, if you per-
severe’ in a wanton and cruel abuse of these objects of his
care, he well knows how to take them out of your power,
and to make you feel how dependent -you are upon the_m.

4‘ ‘ PREFACE.

I ought, in justice to myself and another, to advise the public, that,
in the present’ selection, I have been aided by the taste and judgment
of a gentleman, who is, practically and professionally, a teacher of
the young ;—to whom they are already indebted for several interesting
and useful works for their improvement; and who is entitled to a
part of the credit for Whatever the book contains that is good. For
all that is bad, as it goes under my name, I am responsible.

Rules or directions for reading, I have entirely omitted. Children
can never make any thing of them. These it is left forthe teacher to
give, and to illustrate by his own example ;—-—the only way, I suppose,
in which the art of reading can be well taught. I have, however,
endeavoured to relieve the teacher of a part of his labours, by oc-
casionallyprnarking the pronunciation of a word, at which a beginner
might stumble,~:_a_n_d by indicating what have appeared to be suitable
stopping-places’ ‘iforlpthe successive members of a class. The first I
have done, byplacing over a syllable the common mark of accent (’),
or that of the long (—) or short (') sound over a doubtful vowel, or by
the different spelling of a word in the margin; and the last I have done

»~ by introducing the common arithmetical ﬁgures, rather than by break-

ing up each lesson into short paragraphs, which would often do vio-
lence to -the sense, and injustice to the author. These last marks,
may be observed or not, according -to the pleasure of theteacher.

- 4 The labour of collecting, the materials for this little book would

have been much less-' than it has been, could I have selected freely
from the highest efforts of rhetorical genius—-the most impassioned pas-

sages of the poets and oratorls that have enriched our language. But"

this the nature_of' my humble enterprise forbade; and I cannot but
hope,_that, where passion and splendour would have been out of place,
the absence of them maybe forgiven. I have Wished to make the
book useful to children To this endit must be interesting to children.

58 IN "I‘RUBUCTiON TO 

~ man; his attachment is warmer, his fideiity more unshaken;

he is ever alive to the interests of his master, and seems to
have no enjoyment equal to his society. 2. Itis not surpris-
ing, if a creature possessing such properties has sometimes
been rewarded with reciprocal regard ; and that unEi’sual care
should be taken to teach him, in preference, peculiar feats of
address, which seem denied to the powers of others. 3. Our
limits prevent us from here entering on what would be an
amusing narrative, except to remark, that Plutarch has pre-
served an account of a dog exhibited to the emperor Vespe-
sian, which has scarcely been rivalled in any example of
modern tuition. 41. This dog belonged to an actor; and
nothing could be more skilful in scén’ic representation, and
in imitating various circumstances and situations. 5.» It ex-
hibited in itself the execution of a malefactor, feigned the
taking of poison, and the tremor following its sudden opera-
tion; then, falling down, its limbs were stretched out in per-
fect resemblance of death; and so it remained for a certain
time, until, by a Word from its master, it graduaily opened its
eyes, looked languidly around, and at length recovered.

6. But, in the course of the last century, an exhibition some-
what simiiar took place in Britain, where the storming of a
fort was imitated by dogs, attended by the feigned destruction
of some of the party; and we have witnessed the perform-
ance of many tricks by these animals, such as the solution of
arithmetical questions, and the selection of certain cards, from
a pack spread out, to denote the hour of a watch. 7‘. A dog
has also been taught to carry a glass of wine on a salver witl -
out spilling it; in which we are reminded of a female wolf,
shut up with a companion, that could take up a platter of
food with her teeth, and run round the kennel, preserving the
whole in safety. 8. The account of a dog that was taught
to speak, which has often been incorrectly referred to, should
not be omitted here; and we shall quote the original de-
scription entire from the memoirs of the French academy.
9. "Without the testimony ‘oil such a person as Leibnitz,
an eye-witness, we should not have ventured to mention, that
near Zeitz, in Misnia, there is a dog which speaks. It belongs
to a peasant; is of the most ordinary kind, and of middling
size. 19. A young child, having heard it utter some sounds,
which he thought resembled German words, took a fancy to
teach it to speak. The master, having nothing better to do,

spared neither time‘ nor trouble; and, happily, the pupil had,

dispositions diﬁicultto be found in another. 11. At length,

NATIONAL aspen. 59

after some years, the dog could pronounce aboutthirty words,
among which were tea, cofee, assembly, adopted from the
French into the German language. Its tuition commenced
when it was three years old. 12. The expressions of its
master are only echoed, that is, after he has pronounced a
word,” he compels it, apparently unwilling, to follow his ex-
ample, though no severity be required. We repeat, that it
has been seen and heard by Leibnitz.” 13. Certainly this
is a very astonishing faculty; but the account of the French
academician derives support from other examples, though it
must be acknowledged, that the circumstances are not de-
tail’ed with sufficient distinctness and accuracy.

LESSON XXXII.
Supple and Trusty.-—ANoNYMoUs.

1. THE following anecdote was communicated to a respect-
able English author, by a friend, whom he named Supple,
and who assured him that every word in the narrative was
literally true.

2. Crossing a ferry noted for the barbarism of the ferry-
men, the gentleman observed them to seize a little black dog,'4
ofKing Charles’s breed, for which no one appeared to pay
the fare, and toss him into the water. 3. Supple instantly
took it up, caress’ed and protected it from the brutality of the
boatmen, and answered the demand for his passage. The
creature gratefully clung to his protector, and a strong feel-
ing of mutual amity immediately commenced between them.
4. The passengers were struck with the fondness they sud-
denly conceived for each other. Supple patted the little
stranger, and made so much of him, that he was quite trans- ,
ported: Trusty, in return, frisked and fawned about his kind
benefactor, and would at intervals look him in the face, and

. howl with apparent kindness.

5. “ I should be sorry,” said an old-clothesman, who was
on the other side of the barge, and to whom the dog belong-.
ed, “ to part so loving a couple.”--“ VVill you sell your dog ’!”
asked Supple.-6. “ There is not a better dog of his size and
kind in England,” answered the Jew. Supple demanded his
name. “ He answers,” replied the Jew, “ to Trusty, and will
prove, on trial, how well he merits the title.”

'7. The terms of the bargain were instantly adjusted, and
Supple brought Trusty along with him; and it was not long

60?  I.NTRODUC’1‘I()N TO THE

before an epportunity occurred, which satisﬁed him that the
Jew had’ not deceived him in his character.

8. Supple, being on a tour1 through the west of England,
was benighted on a road that he knew not, and, losing his

way, unfortunately fell into a coal-pit, ten fathoms deep.’

9. All night long did poor Trusty run about the mouth of this
frightful abyss, howling, and deploring the Inisfortune of his
master. In the morning, he retired, and went directly back
to the house which they had left the preceding evening, at
the distance of some miles from the place where the acci-
dent happened.

IO. Here he did every thing but speak, to excite the atten-

tion of the domestics. He was restless and importunate,

looking up at every one piteously; he threw himself on his
back, held up his feet in a supplicating attitude, refused all
sustenance, and howled and fawned, running to and from the
door in such visible distress as nobody could overlook.

11. The h6st’ess, a good-natured Woman, struck, at last,
by the painful importunity she perceived in Trusty’s conduct,
ordered a servant to follow him out. The dog led the way
directly to the pit, where his master remained in a state of

despair, more easy to be conceived than described. 12. The .
‘ servant returned for assistance; and Supple, by the ﬁdelity

of his dog, was happily delivered, though in a conditiongrnore
like death than life. i
13. From that day Supple and Trusty became more insep-
arable companions than ever. What a pity, that ties, thus
reciprocal, sincere, and endearing, should not last for ever!
One morning, as Supple stepped out of his bed, he found
his intimate and faithful Trusty lying dead at his feet.
14. Supple, in great distress for the loss he had sustained,
said, with a sigh, as he hung over the dead body, “ I will do
justice to thy memory, my dog. Thou shalt be buried in my
garden, and thy grave shall be honoured with a stone.”
A 15. He was as good as his word; he graced the funeral
ob’sequies‘~’ of Trusty with a tear, and inscribed this borrow-
ed couplet on the recording stone :--

“Here little Trusty, best of dogs, is laid,
Who fawped like man, out ne’er, like man, betrayed.”

LESSON XXXIII.
The French ZVIerchant.——CHILn’s MONITOR.

1. A FRENCH merchant, having some money due from a
correspondent, set out on horseback, accompanied by his dog,
on purpose to receive it. Having settled the business to his
satisfaction, he tied the bag of money before him, and then
set off for home. His faithful dog, as if he entered into his
master’s feelings, frisked round the horse, barked and jump-
ed, and seemed to participate in his joy.

52. The merchant, after riding some miles, alighted to re-
pose himself under an agreeable shade, and, taking the bag
of money in his hand, laid. it down by his side under a hedge,
and, on remounting, forgot it. The dog perceived his lapse
of recollection, and, wishing to rectify it, ran to fetch the
bag ; but it was too heavy for him to drag along. 3. He then
ran to his master, and, by crying, barking, and howling, en-
deavoured to remind him of his mistake. The merchant did
not understand his language; but the assiduous creature per-
severed in his efforts, and, after trying to stop the horse, in
vain, at last began to bite his heels.

4. The merchant, absorbed in some reverie, wholly over-
looked the real object of his affectionate attendant’s impor-
tunity, but awaked to the alarming apprehension, that he was
gone mad. Full of this suspicion, in crossing a brook, he
turned back to look if the dog would drink. The animal
was too intent on his master’s business to think of himself: he
continued to bark and bite with greater violence than before.

5. “ Mercy!” cried the afflicted merchant; “it must be
so; my poor dog is certainly mad: what must I do? I must
Kill him, lest some greater misfortune befall me; but with
what regret! Oh, could I ﬁnd some one to perform this cruel
oflice for me! but there is no time to lose; I myself may

i become the victim, ifI spare him.”

6. With these words, he drew a pistol from his pocket, '

and, with a trembling hand, took aim at his faithful servant,
turning his face away in agony as he fired ; but hisﬁiprn was
too sure.

The poor animal fell wounded, and, welteirixiggiin‘

his blood, still endeavoured to crawl toward his master,-faisrif

to tax him with ingratitude.

had taken a journey which had cost him so dear. Still, how-
ever, the money never entered his mind; he thought only
of his poor dog, and tried to console himself with the reﬂec-
tion, that he had prevented a greater evil, by despatching a
mad animal, than he had suffered by his loss.

8. This opiate to his wounded spirit was ineffectual: “I
am most unfortunate,” said he to himself; “ I would almost
rather have lost my money than my dog.” Saying this, he

stretched out his hand to grasp his treasure. It was missing ;'

no bag was to be found. 9. In an instant, he opened his eyes
to his rashness and his folly. “ Wretch that I ‘am ! I alone
am to blame. I could not comprehend the admonition which
my innocent and most faithful friend gave me, and I have
sacriﬁced him for his zeal. He wished only to inform me
of my mistake, and he has paid for his ﬁdelity with his
life.”

10. He instantly turned his horse, and went off at full gallop
to the place where he had stopped. He saw, with half-avert-
ed eyes, the scene where the tragedy was acted; he perceiv-
ed the traces of blood as he proceeded; he was oppressed
and distracted; but in vain did he look for his dog-——he was
not to be seen on the road. '

11. At last, he arrived at the spot where he had alighted.
But what were his sensations! His heart was ready to
bleed; he cursed himself in the madness of despair. The
poor dog, unable to follow his dear, but cruel master, had
determined to consecrate his last moments to his service.
He had crawled, all bloody as he was, to the forgotten bag,
and, in the agonies of death, he lay watching beside it.

12. When he saw his master, he still testiﬁed his joy, by the ,

wagging of his tail—he could do no more—he tried to rise,
but his strength was gone. The vital tide was e'l:ibi._ng fast;
even the caresses of his master could not prolong his life for
a few moments. 13. He stretched out his tongue to lick the
hand that was now fondlinghim in the agonies of regret, as

if to seal forgiveness for the deed that had deprived him of I

life. He then cast a look of kindness on his master, and
closed his eyes for ever. Poor dog! I regret thy untimely
end!

LESSON XXXIV.
The Dog and the Lab0m~er.--ANEcDoTEs on ANIMALS.

1. AT the parsonage house at Eden, in Staffordshire, Eng-
land, was kept a large house-dog, which, like most of his
kind, was a very sagacious animal. He was kind to his
friends, but formidable to those whom h_e regarded as the
enemies of the family to which he belonged, and, as the fol-
lowing account will show, he was a faithful servant. 2. This
dog, though gentle, was always kept in chains in the day,
and let loose in the night, as the nocturnal guard of his
mas’ter and his property.

3. A labourer, who had gained the conﬁdence of both his
employer and his dog, was intrusted with the key of the barn
door, and had frequently been employed to bring sacks of
corn from the barn to the house, for the use of the family.

4. Thinking himself perfectly secure, by the trust reposed in .

him, and having no fear of being molested bythe dog, although
he knew he was then unchained, he ventured, one night, to
take a sack of corn out of the barn, for the use of some other
person or family. 5. The dog attended him very quietly, as
long as he pursued the path that led to his master’s house :
but, on leaving the road, he caught hold of his coat, and would
not suﬁer him to stir from the place. 6. The man, very un-
expectedly ﬁnding himself a prisoner, endeavoured to return
to the barn with the corn he had stolen ; but the dog, as if
acquainted with his design, would not let him return. 7. In
this unpleasant posture, the unhappy man was obliged to
remain all night, standing by the sack of corn and the dog:
the latter held him fast, though he did not bite or hurt him
in‘ the least; and, to his great regret. and mortiﬁcation, in
this strange situation he was found in the morning. 8. This
very extraordinary circumstance soon led to a discovery of
his wicked intention; for, on being asked how he came

there, and what he was going to do with the corn, conscious

of his guilt, he made an open confession of his dishonesty;
and, at the same time, threw himself at the foot-stool of
mercy.  What an intolerable load has that man to carry,
who is weighed down with a guilty conscience! r
10; The sagacity of this faithful dog not only saved his
master’s corn, but was the means of reclaiming the man, by

an early exposure of his faults; for, by evil communications,

it seems, he had got his manners so corrupted,\that, through

64 ‘ INTRODUCTION TO ’I‘HE

the persuasion of some bad companions, he had committed
the crime above mentioned. 11. Had it not been through
the lenity of a merciful justice of peace in the neighbour-
hood, (a Mr. Palmer,) he would doubtless havexsuﬂlered the
rigour of the laws of his country, which he had so unguard-
edly broken. 1?. Instead of thus exposing him, the worthy
magistrate took great pains to convince him of the danger of
such associates, and the enormity of his offence; and, the
more effectually to preserve him from any further intercourse
with the former, and to remove him from a place where his
character was lost, he prevailed with a friend of his in Shrop-
shire to take him on trial, having ﬁrst informed him of his
misconduct. 13. This last act of kindness entirely overcame
him ; he wept like a child, and made the most solemn prom-
ises of amendment. 14. As he was young, and not harden-
ed in vice, he found it not difficult to keep his word, and
afford his benefactor the satisfaction of having, by well-timed
lenity, saved a fellow-creature from inevitable ruin. 15. How
superior was this merciful conduct, to that unfeeling severity,
wlriclrjinﬂicts the penalty of the law on the ﬁrst offence, and
gives""no opportunity to the novice in vice to recover the false

‘ steps which he has taken!

16. l\’Ir. Palmer was not only merciful, but so considerate
as to make proper allowances for beginners; but with old
offenders, especially those who misled the young and un-

.w€1ry, he was ﬁrm in punishing as the law prescribed.

17. “ Mercy to them,” he said, “is cruelty to the rest of
,2:

society, adding, that he thought it his duty to prevent the‘
repetition of crimes by the certainty of punishment.

LESSON XL.  
The Snow-St07‘m.——PORTLAND Angus.

1. IN the month of December, 1821, a Mr. Blake, with
his wife and an infant, was passing over the Green Mountain,
near the town of Arlington, Vermont, in a sleigh with one
horse. The drifting snow rendered it impossible for the
horse to proceed. Mr. Blake set off on foot in search of as-
sistance, and ‘perished in the storm, before he could reach a
human dwelling. 2. The mother, alarmed (as is supposed)
at his long absence, went in quest of" him with the infant in
her arms. She was found, in the morning, dead, a‘ short dis-
tance from the sleigh. The child was wrapped in her cloak,
and survived the perils of the cold and the storm.

3. The cold winds swept the mountain’s height,
And pathless was the dreary wild,
And, ’mid the cheerless hours of night.
A mother wandered with her ehild. "s
As through the drifted snows she pressed,
The babe was sleeping on her breast.

4 And colder still the winds did blow,
And darker hours of night came on,
And deeper grew the drifts of .snow—-- , ,
Her limbs were chilled, her strength was.gone—-
“ O God,” she cried, in accents wild,
“ If I must perish, save my child !”

5 She stripped her mantle from her breast,
And bared her bosom to the storm,
And round the child she wrapped the vest,
And smiled, to think her babe was warm. -

With one cold kiss, one tear she shed,
And sunk upon a snowy bed.
6. At dawn, a traveller passed by :
She lay beneath a snowy veil;
The frostof death was in her eye;
Her cheek was cold, and hard, and pale :--
He moved the robe from off the child ;
The babe looked up, and sweetly smiled.

LESSON XLI.
" Remarkable ;S'e(f-possessz'0n.——-DETno1'r- GAZETTE.

1. ON the banks of the N augatuck’, a rapidistream, which
rises in, and ﬂows through, a very mountainous part of the

. state of Connecticut, a few years since, lived a farmer, who,

though not a wealthy, was a respectable man. 2. He had
fought the battles of his country in the revolution, and, from
his familiarity with scenes of danger and peril, he had learn-
ed, that it is always ’ more prudent to preserve and affect the
air of conﬁdence in danger, than to betray signs of fear; and
especially so, since his conduct might have a great in’ﬂuence
upon the minds of those about him. 3. He had occasion to
send a little son across the river to the house of a relative,
on an errand, and, as there was then no bridge, the river
must be forded.

4. The lad was familiar with every part of the fording
place, and, when the water was low, which was at this time
the case, could cross without danger. 5. But he had scarcely
arrived at his place of destination, and done his errandfiivhen
suddenly, as is frequently the case in moun’tainous countries,
the heavens became blackwith clouds, the winds blew with
great violence, and the rain fell in v torrents; it was near
night, and became exceedingly dark. 6. By the kindness of

" his friends, he was persuaded to relinquish his design of re-

turning in the evening, and to wait  morning. The
father suspected the cause of his‘.delay‘a;;’and was not over
anxious on account of any accident thatmight happen to hirn

during the night. ,7. But he knew that he had taught his”

son to render the most obséquiofls obedience1 to his father’s
commands; that, as he possessed? a daring and fearless spirit,

and would never be restrained by force, he Would, as soon

as it should be suﬂiciently light in the morning, attempt to
ford the river on his return. 8. He knew ‘also, that the im-
mense quantity1 of water, that appeared to be falling, would,
by morning, cause the river to rise to a considerable height,
and make it dangerous, even for a man, in full POSSBSSIOIIQ of
strength and fortitude, to attempt to cross it. 9. He there-
fore passed a sleepless night; anti’cipating, with all a father’s
feelings, what might befall his child in the morning.
1().~The day dawned; the storm had ceased; the wind
was still, and nothing was to ‘be heard but the roar of the
river. The rise3 of the river eggceeded even the father’s ex-
pecta’tions: and no sooner was it sufficiently light to enable
him to distin’guisl.1 objects across¢it,,‘ than he placed himself
on the bank, to watch for the approachof his son. 11. The
son arrived on the op’posfte shore at the same moment, and
was beginning to enter the stream. All the father’s feelings
were roused into action; for he knew that" his son was in
the most imminent danger. 12. He had proceeded too fat
to return; in fact, to go forward or return was to incur the
same peril. 13. His horse had got into the deepest part
of the channel, and was struggling against the current, down
which he was rapidly hurried, and appa’rently making but lit-
tle progress toward the shore. The boy became alarmed, and,
raising his eyes towards the landing-place,‘he discovered his
father: he exclaimed, almost frantic with fear, “ Oh! I shall
drown, I shall drown l” 14. “No!” exclaimed the father,
in a stern and resolute tone, and dismissing, for a mornent,
his feeling of tenderness: ‘‘ if ou do, I’ll whip you todeath :
cling to your horse.” 15. T e son, who feared a father
more than the raging elements, obeyed his command; and
the noble animal, on which he was mounted, struggling for
some time, carried him safe to 1 ore. 16. “My son,” said
the glad .father, bursting into te rs, “remember, hereafter,

that, in danger, you must possess f6r’tit1'ide, and, determining ’

to survive, cling to the last hope. 17. Had I addressed you
with the tenderness and fear which I felt, your fate was in-
evitable; you would have been carried4 away in the current,
and I should have seen you no more.” 18. What an exam-
ple is here! The hér’oism, bravery, philos’ophy, and pres.
ence of mind of this man, eclipse the conduct even of Caesar,
when he said to his boaﬂman, “ What are ydﬁafraid of ’! you

M. 72 INTRODUCTION To THE

LEssoN XLII.
Anecdote of John Ledg/a7'd.——SPAR1{s

1. AFTER abandoning his missionary schemes, young Led-
yard began to grow weary of college, and the more so, ‘prob-
ably-, as his unsettled habits now - and then drew from the
president a salutary“admonitionﬁin the importance of a right

‘use of time, and a regard for the regulations of the establish-

ment. _ Such hints he conceixved to be an indignity, and «fan-
cied himself ill treated.  ‘That there was value in rules of

_ order and discipline, he did not pretend to deny,,but seemed
‘at a loss to imagine’ \Vol‘1y§th€y should apply to him. That

the whole subject-_ ‘might ‘be put at "rest, without involving
any puzzling questio"ns of cas’uistry, he resolved to escape.
3. On the margin of the Connecticut river, which runs
near the college,’’‘ stood many majestic forest. trees, nourish-
ed by a rich soil. One‘*of these Ledyard‘ contrived to cut
down. He then set himself at work to fashion its trunk into
a cancel, and in this labour he was assisted. by some of his

fellow students. , 4. As the canoe was ﬁfty ‘feet long, and 3

three wide, and was to be dug out and constructed by these

, unskilful workmen, the task was not a triﬂing one, nor such

as could be speedily executed‘. Operations were cgi*i'ied on

‘with sp.irit, however, till Ledyard wounded himself with an

axe, and was disabled for several days. 5. When recovered,
he applied himself anew to his-work; the canoe was ﬁnish-
edflaunched into the stream, and, by’ the further aid of his
companions, equipped and [prepared for a voy.?.ge. 6. His

ijwishes were now .at their consummation, and, bidding adieu
A to these haunts of the muses; where he had gained a dubious

fame, he set off alone, w'itli_fa light heart, to explore river,

with the navigation of . w7lii°ch he had not the slightest ac-

quaintance. '7. The distance to Hartford was not less than
one hundred and forty miles; much of the way was through

"a‘ wilderness, and in several places there were dangerous"

falls and rapids- , , A
8.’iWith a bearskin for a covering, and his canoe well

, stocked with provisions, he yielded himself to =...the current,

and floated leisurely down the stream, seldom using his pad-
dle, andstopping only in the night for sleep. 9. He told

V Mr. Jefferson-in Paris, fourteen ‘years afterwards, that he
took only t\,\,7,_(),'7=re1.*<;i7J,O0l{S with him, a  Testament, and

€)‘vid, one of which he was deeply engaged in reading, when
I ’ ' ‘.
his canoe approached Bellows s Falls, where he was sudden-
ly roused by the noise of the waters rushing among the rocks
through the narrow passage. 10. The danger was Immi-
nent, as no boat could go down that fall without being in-
stantly dashed in pieces. ‘v-Vith difliculty he gained the shore
in time to escape such a c§.tas"trépl1e, and, through the kind

assistance of the people in the neighbourhood, who were .

astonished at the novelty of such a voyage down the Con--
necticut, his canoe was drawn by oxen around the fall, and
committed again to the water below. 11. From that time,
till he arrived at his place of destination, we hear of no acci-
dent, although he was carried throughyseveral dangerous
passes in the river. 12. On a bright spring morning, just as
the sun was rising, some of Mr. Seymour’s family were stand-
ing near his house on the high bank of the small river, that
runs through tlleﬁlty of H.ar,tford, and empties itself into the
Connecticut riv,ei4, when they espied at.‘ some distance an ob-
iect of i1i1uf's{iz‘3.l appearance, moving slowly up the stream.
.13. Others were attracted by the sihgularity of the sight, and
all were conjecturing what it could be, till its questionable
‘shape assumed the true and ‘obvious form of a canoe; but
by what impulse it was moved fo1‘ward none could deter-
mine. Something Vvas seen in the sfiirn, but apparently
without'lif‘e or motion. 14. At length thercanoe touched
the shore directly in front of the house; a person sprang
frorn the stern to a rock in the edge of the water, threw oil‘

» a bearskin in which he had been enveloped, and behold John
,. Ledyard, in the presence of his uncle and connexions, who

were ﬁlled with w_onder at this sudden apparition ; for they had

“i received no intelligence of his intention to leave Dartmouth,

but supposed him still there, diligently pursuing his studies,
and ﬁtting himselfto be a missionary, among the Indians.

15. However unimportant this whimsical adventure may
have been in its results, or even its objects, it was one of no
ordinary peril, and illustrated, in a forcible manner, the char-
acter of the navigator. The voyage was performed‘ in the
last part of April, or ﬁrst cf May, and of course the river was
raised by the recent” melting of the snow on the mauntains.
16. This circumstance, probably, rendered the rapids less
dangerous, but it may be questioned whether there aregmany
persons, at the present day, who would willingly run the
same hazard, even if guided by a pilot skilled in the naviga
tion of the river

17. We cannot look back to Ledyard, thus launching himw
self alone in so frail a bark, upon the waters of a river wholly
unknown to him, without being reminded of the only similar
occurrence, which has been recorded, the voyage down the
river Niger, by Mungo Park, a name standing at the very
head of those most renowned for romantic and lofty enter--
prise. 18. The melancholy fate, it is true, by which he was
soon arrested in his noble career, adds greatly to the interest
of his situation, when pushing from the shore his little boat
Joliba, and causes us to read his last affecting letter to his
wife with emotions of sympathy more intense, if possible,
than would be felt if the tragical issue were not already
known. 19. In many points of character, there was a strong
resemblance between these two distinguished travellers, and
they both perished, martyrs in the same cause, attempting to
explore the hidden regions of Africa. ‘

LESSON XLIII.
Cause of tire American Revolution.-—TUnoR.

C

1. WHEN the first President Adams was minister at the court
of St. James, he often saw his countrygiian, Benjamin West,
the late president of the royal academy, who always retained‘
a strong and unyielding afiiectiion for his native land. 2. Mr.
VVest one day asked Mr. Adams, if he should like to take a
walk with him, and see the cause of the ‘American revolu-—
tion. 8. The minister, having known something of this
matter, smiled at the proposal, but told him that he should

be glad to see the cause of that revolution, and to take a '

walk with his friend West any where. 4. The next morn-
ing he called, according to agreement, and took Mr. Adams
into Hyde Park, to a spot near the Serpentine river, where
he gave him the following narrative. 5. “The king came
to the throne a young man, surrounded by ﬂattering cour-
tiers; one of whose frequent topics it was, to declaim against

the meanness of his palace, which was wholly unworthy of"

a monarch of such a country as England. 6. They said that
there was not a sovereign in Europe, who was lodged so
poorly; that his sorry, dingy, old, brick palace of St. James,
looked like a stable, and that he ought to build a palace
suitable to his kingdom. 7. The king was fond of architec-=

ture, and would therefore more readily listen to suggestions, ’

which were, in fact, all true. This spot, that you see here,

N.i*rioNAL READER, 75

was selected for the site, between this and- this point, which
were marked out. 8. The king’ appliedito his ministers on

the subject; they inquired‘ what sum -would be wanted by
his majesty, who said that he would begin with a million;
they stated the expenses of the war, and the poverty of the
treasury, but that his majesty’s wishes .should be taken into
full consideration. 9. Some time afterwards, the king was
informed, that the wants of the treasury were too urgent to
admit of a supply from their present means, but that a rev’e-
nue might be raised in America to supply all the king’s wish-
es. "lﬁ. This suggestion was followed up, and the king was
in this way first led to consider, and then to adopt, the
scheme for taxing the colonies.”

LESSON .XLlV. '
Female Pair‘-iotz'sm.—-—ANoNmious.

1. Tue feilo_wing anecdote, which is too well authentica-
ted to be disputed, furnishes one instance, among thousands,
of that heroic spirit and love of liberty, which characterized

[the American females during the struggle for independence.

2. “ A good lady;-—we knew her when she had grown old,
——in 1775, lived on the sea-board, about a day’s march from
I5oston,wl_1ere the British army then was. By some upac-

. countable accident, a rumour was spread, in town and coun-
try, in and about there, that the riegulars were on a full march

for tliatplace, and would probably arrive in three hours“.
3. This was after the battle of Lexington, and all, as might

be well supposed, was in sad ‘confusion : "some were boiling

with rage, and full of ﬁght; some, in fear and confusion,
were hiding their treasures; and others ﬂying for life. 4. In
this wild moment, when most people, in some way or other,
were frightened from their property, our her’o‘1’ne,‘who had
two sons, one about nineteen years of age, the other about
sixteen,,was seen by our informant preparing them to dis-
charge their duty. 5. The eldest she was able to equip in

‘fine style: she took her husband’s fowling-piece, ‘made for

duck or ploverl,’ (the good man being absent on a coasting
voyage to Virginia,) and witli it the powder-horn and shot-
bag. 6. But the lad thinking the duck, and goose shot not
quite the size to kill regulars, his mother took a,chisel9,. ‘cut
up her pewter spoons, hammered them into 'slu'gs,_:“~_a?nd put

them into his bag, and he setoff in great earnest, but thought
he would call one moment and see the parson, who said,
‘Well done, my brave boy! God preserve you ;’ and on he
went in the way of his duty. 7’. The youngest was impor-
tunate for his equipments, but his mother could ﬁnd nothing
to arm him with, but an "old rustysword. The boy seemed
rather unwilling to risk himself with this alone, but lingered
in the street, in a state of hesitation, when his mother thus
upbraided him : 8. ‘ You John  what will your father
say, if he hears that a child of his is afraid to meet the Brit-
ish ’?—-go along: beg or borrow a gun, or you will ﬁnd one,
child: some coward, I dare say, will be running away: then
take his gun, and march forward ; and if you come back, and
I hear you have not behaved like a man, I shall carry the
blush of shame on my face to the grave.’ 9. She t_hen shut
the door, wiped the tear from her eye, and waited the issue.
The boy joined the march. Such a woman could not have
cowards for her sons. 10. Instances of reﬁned and delicate
pride and affection occurred, at that period, every day, in
different places; and, in fact, this disposition and feeling was

then so common, that it now operates as one great cause. of ' ’

our not having more facts of this kind recorded. 11. What
few there are remembered should not be lost. Nothing great
or glorious was ever achieved, which women did not act in,
advise, or consent to.”

LESSON XLV.
Skctc.7z of the Life of General Putiumz.-MORSE.

1. ISRAEL PUTNAM was born at Salem, Massachusetts,
January 7, 1718. His mind was vigorous, but it was never
cultivated by education. V‘/Ihen he for the first time went to
Boston, he was insulted for his rusticity, by a boy of twice

his size. After hearing his sarcasms until his good nature.

was exhausted, he attacked andvanquished the unmannerly
fellow, to the great diversion of a crowd of spectators. In

running, leaping and wrestling, he almost always bore away

the prize. i

2. In 1739, he removed to Pomfret, in Connecticut, where
he cultivated a considerable tract of land. He had, however,
to encounter many difficulties, and, among his troubles, the

’ depredations of wolves upon his sheepfold was not the least. I

‘In one night‘, seventy ﬁne sheep and goats were killed. 3 A

she wolf, who, with her annual whelps, had for several years

infested the vicinity, being considered as the principal cause.

of the havoc, Mr. Putnam entered into a combination with
a number of his neighbours, to hunt alternately, till they
should destroy her. 4 At length the hounds drove her into
her den, and a number of persons soon collected with guns,
straw, ﬁre and sulphur, to attack the common enemy. , _But
the dogs were afraidto approach her, and thefumes of brim-
stone could not force her from. the cavern. 5. It was now
ten o’clock at night. Mr. Putnam proposed to his black ser-
vant to descend into the cave, and shoot the wolf; but, as
the negro declined, he resolved to do it himself. 6. Having
divested himself of his coat and waistcoat, and having a long
rope fastened round his legs, by which he might -be pulled
back at a concerted signal, he entered the cavern, head

 foreinost, with a blazing torch, made of strips of birch bark,
"in his hand. 7. He descended ﬁfteen ‘feet, passed along

horizontally ten feet, and then began the gradual ascent,

. which is sixteen feet in length. He_ slowly proc_eeded_ on

his hands and knees, in an abode which was silent as
the ,house of‘ death. 8. Cautiously looking forwards, he

‘discovered the glaringeye-balls of the wolf, who started at
I‘ the sight ofhis torch‘, gnashed her. teeth, and gave a sullen

growl. He_,immediately_ kicked‘ the rope, and was drawn
out with a‘ friendly céler’ity and ’violence,'which not a little
bruised him. 9. Loading his gun with nine buck-shot, and
carrying it in one hand, while he held_,the torch with the
other, he desce'nded__a second time. As he approached the

‘wolf’, "she ,_howle‘d,' rolled her eyes, snapped her teeth, drops-

ped her head betv‘veeII1:-j-h‘_er legs, and was evidently on the
point of springing at him. ' 10. At this moment he ﬁred at

her~head,_and soon ‘found himself drawn out of’ the cave-..

Having refreshed himself, he again descended, and, seizing
the wolf by her ears, kicked the rope, and his companions
above, with- nog.small exultation, dragged them both out to-
gether. .  '" ' _, . 5  .

enemy. 13. Being ambuscéﬂded by a party of eqinil num-
bers, a general but irregular action took place. Putnam-had
discharged his fusee several times, but at length it missed
ﬁre, while its muzzle was presented to the breast of a savage.
14. The Warrior, with his lifted hatchet, and a tremendous
war-Whoop, compelled him to surrender, and then bound
him to a tree. In the course of the action, the parties chan-
ged their position, so as to bring this tree directly between
them. 15. The balls ﬂew by him incessantly; many struck
the tree,,and some passed through his clothes. The enemy
now gained possession of the ground, but, being afterwa.rds
driven from the ﬁeld, they carried their prisoner with them.
16. At night he was stripped, and a tire was kindled to roast
him alive; but a French officer saved him. The next day
he arrived at Ticonderoga, and thence he was carried to
Montreal. 17. About the year 1759., he was exchanged,
through the inﬂuence of his fellow-prisoner, Col. Schuyler.
VVhen peace took place, he returned to his farm.

LESSON XLVI.
The same ,—c0ncluded.

1. PUTNAM was ploughing in his ﬁeld, in 1775, when he
heard the news of the battle of Lexington. He immediately
unyoked his team, left his plough on the spot, and, without
changing his clothes, set off for Cambridge. He soon went
back to Connecticut, levied a regiment, and repaired again
to the camp. 2. In a little time he was promoted to the
rank of major-general. In the battle of Bunker’s Hill, he ex-
hibited his usual intrepidity. He directed the men to reserve
their ﬁre till the enemy was very near, reminded them of
their skill, and told them to take good aim. They did so,
and the execution was terrible. 3. After the retreat, he
made a stand at VVinter Hill, and drove back the enemy un-
der cover of their ships. ‘When the army was organized by
General VVashington, at Cambridge, Putnam was appointed
to command the reserve. 4. In August, 1776, he was sta

‘ tioned at Brooklyn, on Long Island. After the defeat of our

army, on thc..t*W1enty-seventh of that month, he went. to New
York, and was very serviceable in - the city and neighbour-
hood. In October or November, he was sent to Philadel-

phia to fortify that city. 5. In January, 1777, he was di-

rented to take post at Princeton, where he cont.inued until

.NATIQNAL REA.I)EP... 79

spring. At this place, a sick prisoner, a captain, requested
that a friend in the British army, at Brunswick, might be
sent for, to assist him in making his will. 6. Putnam was
perplexed. He had but ﬁfty men under his command, and
he did not wish to have his weakness known; yet he was
unwilling? to deny the request. He, however, sent a ﬂag
of truce, and directed the oiiicer to be brought in the night.
7. In the evening, lights were placed in all the college win-
dows, and in every apartment of the vacant houses through-
out the town. The oﬂicer, on his return, reported that Gen-
eral Putnanfs army couldnot consist ofless than four or five
thousand men. 8. In the spring, he was appointed to the
command of a separate army, in the highlands of New York.
One Pahner, a lieutenant in the tory new levies, was de-
tected in the camp. Governor Tryon claimed him as a Brit-
ish oﬁicer, threatening vengeance if he was not restored.
9. General Pntnani wrote the following pithy reply: “ Sir,
“Nathan Palmer, a lieutenant in your king’s service, was taken
inmy camp as a spy; he was tried as a. spy; he was con-
demned as a spy; and he shall be hanged as a spy. P. S.
Afternoon. He is hanged.” 10. After the loss of fort Mont-
gomery, the commander in chief determined to build another
fortiﬁcation, and he directed Putnam to ﬁx upon a spot. To
him belongs the praise of having chosen ‘West Point. The
eampaign of R779, which was principally spent in strength-
ening the works at this place, ﬁnished the military career of
Putnam. 11. A paralytic affection impaired the activity of
his body, and he passed the remainder of his days in retire-
ment, retaining his relish for enjoyment, his love of pleasant-
ry, his strength of memory, and all the faculties of his mind.
He died at Brooklyn, Connecticut, May 29, 1790, aged sev-
enty-two years.

‘ LESSON XLVII.
The Bald Eagle--A. WILSON.

.1. True distinguished bird, as he is the most beautiful of
his tribe in this part of the world, and the adopted emblem
of our country, is entitled to particular notice. 2. He has
been long known to naturalists, being common to both con-
tinents, and occasionally met with from a very high northern

latitude to the borders of the torrid zone, but chieﬂy. in the

vieinit.y of the sea, and along the shores and cliﬁisi-of our

St}. ll"‘«Y‘R€3I)I.lC’FlON TO TH}?

lakes and large rivers. 3. Formed by nature fo1‘l.si°a%i.ﬂg_4tl1e
severest cold; feeding equally on the produce of the sea and
of the land ;‘ possessing powers of flight capable of outstrip»
ping even the tempests themselves; unawed by any thing
but man; and, from the ethereal heiglitsrte which he soars,
looking abroad, at one glance,_on an immeasurable expanse
of forests, fields, lakes and ocean, deep below him ; he-
appears indifferent to local- changes of season, as, in a few
minutes, he can pass from summer to winter, from the lower
to the higher regions of the atmosphere, the abode of eternal‘
cold, and thence descend at will to the torrid or the arctic
regions of the earth. 4. He is therefore found at all seasons
in the countries which he inhabits, but prefers such places
as have been mentioned above, from the great partiality he
has for ﬁsh.

5. In procuring these, he displays, in a very sin-gular man--

ner, the genius and energy of hischaracter, which is ﬁerce,

contemplative, daring an._cl.,tyran’nical; attributes not exerted
but on particular occasions, but, when put forth, overwhelming
all opposition. 6. Elevated upon a high, dead limb of some
gigantic tree, that commands a wide view of the neighbours-
mg shore and ocean, he seems calmly to contemplate the
.mo,tions of the various feathered tribes that pursue their busy
avocations below,——the snow-white gulls, slowly winnov.*-
ing the air; the busy sand-pipers, coursing along the beach ;
trains of ducks, streaming over the surface; silent and watch»
ful cranes,,._intent and wading; clamorous crows, and all
the winged multitudesthat subsist by the bounty of this vast
liquid magazine of nature. '7. High over all these hovers
one, whose action instantly arrests his attention. By his wide
curvature of wing, and sudden suspension in air, he knows
him to he the ﬁsh-hawk, settling over some devoted victim
of the deep. His eye kindles at the sight, and, balancing
himself with half-opened wings on the branch, he watches

the result. 8. Down, rapid as an arrow from heaven, de-

scends the distan-t object of his attention, the roar of its wings
reaching the ear as it disappears in the deep, making the sure
ges foam around. 9. At this moment the looks of the eagle
are all ardour, and, levelling his neck for ﬂight, he sees the
ﬁsh-hawk emerge, struggling with his prey, and mounting

into the air with screams of exultation. 10. These are the _
signal for our hero, who, launching into the air, instantly,

gives chase, and soon gains on the ﬁsh-hawk. Each exer,t;;éi-+v¥i=

his utmost to mount above the other, displaying, in l.l1v.:S.:§‘§fT,.-“-ii

NATIONAL READER. s 81

rencounters, the most elegant and sublime aerial evolutions.
11. The unincumbered eagle rapidly advances, and is just
on the point of reaching his opponent, when, with a sudden
scream, probably of despair and honest execration, the latter
drops his ﬁsh; the eagle, poising himself for a moment, as if
to take a more certain aim, descends like a whirlwind, snatch-
es it in his grasp, ere it reaches the water, and bears his ill-
gotten booty silently away to the woods.

LESSON XLVIII.
The Zl/Ioclcing B£7't'l.——-—THn SAME.

I. THE plumage of the mocking bird, though none of the
homeliest, has nothing gaudy or brilliant in it, and, had he

nothing else to recommend him, would scarcely entitle, him" _

to notice; but his figure is well proportioned, and even hand-
some. The ease, elegance, and rapidity of his movements,
the animation of his eye, and the intelligence he displays in
listening, and laying up lessons from almost every species of
the feathered creation within his hearing, are really surpris-
ing, and mark the peculiarity of his genius. 2. To these
qualities we may add that of a voice full, strong and musi-
cal, and capable of almost every modulation, from the clear,
mellow tones of the wood thrush, to the savage screams of
the bald eagle. 3. in n easnre and accent, he faithfully fol-
lows his originals. In force, and sweetness of expression, he
greatly improves upon them. In his native groves, mounted
upon the top of a tall bush, or lialf-grown tree, in the dawn
of dewy morning, while the woods are already vocal with a
multitude of Warblers, his admirable song rises pre-eminent
over every competitor. 4. The ear can listen to his music

alone, to which that of all the others seems a more ac-.

companiment. Neither is this strain altogether imitative.
His own native notes, which are easily distinguishable by
such as are well acquainted with those of our various birds
of song, are bold and full, and varied, seemingly, beyond all
limits. 5. They consist of short expressions of two, three,
or, at the most, five or six syllables, generally interspersed
with imitations, and all of them uttered with great emphasis
and rapidity, and continued, with undiminished ardour, for
half an hour, or an hour, at a time. 6. His expanded wings

and" tail; glistening with white, and the buoyant gayety of-

his action, arrests the eye, as his song most irresistibly does

82 II‘lTEGDUC’1‘lUN TO ’I‘HI:Z

the ear. He sweeps round with enthusiastic ecstasy,---he
mounts and descends, as his song swells er dies away, and,
as Mr. Bartram has beautifully expressed it, “ he bounds aloft
with the celerity of an arrow, as if to recall his very soul,
which expired in the last elevated strain.” 7. ’While,thus
exerting himself, a bystander, destitute of sight, would sup-
pose that the whole feathered tribes had assembled together,
on a trial of skill, each striving tn produce his utmost effect,——-
so perfect are his iniitations.  He many times deceives
the sportsrnan, and sends him in search of birds, that, per-
haps, are not Within miles of him, but whose notes he exactly
imitates. Even birds themselves are frequently imposed on
by this admirabie niirnic, and are decayed by the fancied calls
of their mates, or dive, with precipitation, into the depths of
thickets, a.t the scream of what they suppose to be the sp-a.r~
row-hawk.

9. The mocking bird loses little of the power and energy
0f his song by confinement, In his doinesticated state, when
he commences his career of soiig, it is impossible to stand by
uninterested. 1%). He whistles ibr the dog: Caesar starts up,
wags his tail, and runs to meet. his master. He squeaks out
like a hurt chicizen; and the hen hurries about, with hang-
ing wings and bristled feathers, clncking to protect her in-
inred breed. 1}. He runs ever the qui\7e1°itigs of the czimiry,
and the clear vvliist,lings of the Vir,g__>;ii':i:3. niglitiiigale or red
bird, with such superior execntien end eﬂect, that the morti-
ﬁed songsters feel their own i.nfei'ierity, and become altogeth-
er silent, while he seems to trii;irniiii1 in their defeat, by re-
doubling his exertions. _

12. This e3-zcessive fbndness for variety, however, in the
opinion of some, injures his song;. His elevated imitations
of the brown thrush are freqnentiy interriipted by the crow-

ing of cocks; and the n*arlJlin_;;s of the hide bird, which he

exquisitely Iiianagfes, are mingled vvith the screaming of swal-
lows, or the ca.ekiiiig ofhens; ainidst the simple melody of
the robin, we are sirddenly Si1I"§f91‘iS€(i by the shrill reiterations
of the wliip-poor-will ; while the notes of the kildeer, blue
jay, marten, baitirnore, and ti. ’enty others, succeed, with such
imposing reality, that we look round for the originals, and dis-
cover, with astonishment, that the sole performer, in this sin-
gnlar concert, is the admirable bird now before’ us. 13. Du-
ring this exhibition of his powers, he spreads his wings, ex-

pands his tail, and throws himself around the cage in allthe ’

ecstasy of enthusiasm, seeming not only to sing, but to dance,

 .aT‘ION AL READER. 83

keeping time to the measure of his own music. 14. Both in
his mtive and domesticated state, during the solemn stillness
of the night, as soon as the moon rises in silent majesty, he
begins his delightful solo, and serenades us with a full display
of hs vocal powers, making the whole neighbourhood ring
withhis inimitable melody.

LESSON XLIX.
On Erizplzasis and Pauses.—BLAIR.

1. BY emphasis is meant that stronger and fuller sound of
voi:e, bywhich, in reading or speaking, we distinguish the
accented syllable of some word, on which we design to lay
paricular stress, in order to show how it affects the rest of
the sentence. 2. On the right management of the emphasis
depends the whole life and spirit of every discourse. If no
errphasis be placed on any word,..not only is discourse ren-
deed heavy and lifeless, but the meaning is often left ambig-
uois. If the emphasis be placed wrong, we pervert and con-
found the meaning wholly.

3. To give a common instance; such a simple question as
this, “ Do you ride to town to-day ‘P’ is capable of no fewer
than four different acceptations, according as the emphasis is
differently placed on the words. 4. If it be pronounced thus :
Dc you ride to town to-day’! the answer may naturally be,
N‘c: I send my servant in my stead. If thus: Do your ride
to town to-day? Answer,——-—No : I intend to walls. Do you
ride to town to-day ? No: I ride out into tkej2'7r:!tZ.~;. Do you
ride to town to-day .7 No : but I shall to-marrow.

5. In order to acquire the proper management of the em.-
phasis, the great rule, and indeed the only rule possible to
be given, is, that the speaker or reader study to attain a just
ccmception of the force and spirit of those sentiments which
he is to pronounce. 6. For, to lay the emphasis with exact
propriety, is a constant exercise of good sense and attention.
It is far from being an inconsiderable attainment. It is one
of the greatest trials of a true and just taste ; and must arise

from feeling delicately ourselves, and from judging accurately.

of what is fittest to strike the feelings of others.
7. Next to emphasis, the pauses in speaking demand at-
tention. These are of two kinds: ﬁrst, emphatical pauses :

-t a1i,df,next, such as‘ mark the distinctions of sense._ An em-

phatical pause is made after something has been said of pecu-

84 INTRODUCTION TO THE

liar moment, on which we want to fix the hearer’s attention
8. Such pauses have the same effect as a strong emphasis,
and are subject to the same rules; especially to the caution
of not repeating them too frequently.

9. But the most frequent and the principal use of pauses
is, to mark the divisions of the, sense, and, at the same ime,
to allow the speaker to draw his breath: and the prope: ad-
justment of such pauses is one of the most difficult artcles
in delivery. 10. In all reading and public speaking, the nan-
agement of the breath requires great care, so as not to be
obliged to divide words from one another, which have so nti-
mate a connexion, that they ought to be pronounced inthe

same breath, and without the least separation.

11. Many sentences are miserably mangled, and the frrce
of the emphasis totally lost, by divisions being made inthe
wrong place. To avoid this, every one, while he is rearing
or speaking, should be careful to provide a full supply of
breath for what he is to utter. 12. It is a great mistake to
imagine that the breath must be drawn only at the end 0' a
period, when the voice is allowed to fall. It may easily be
gathered at the intervals of the period, when the voice is cnly
suspended for a moment; and, by this management, we nay
always have a sufficient stock for carrying on the longest
sentence, without improper interruptions.

LESSON L.
L0vcZl’s F2'glet.——-HISTORICAL CoLLEcT1oNs."‘

1. ON the margin of a little lake in the township of F1'ye»
burg, in the state of Maine, is the spot where the pride of '
the once powerful tribe of the Pequawkets was broken, and
the scene of the desperate conﬂict, maintained by the gallant
and unfortunate Captain Lovell, and his little band, with the
red Warriors who formerly possessed the fertile and beautiful
intervales of the Sacol. _

2. Lovell had been long distinguished among the partisan
warriors of the times. His former successes had been great.
On one occasion, he surprised and killed a party of ten sav-
ages, whose scalps, stretched on hoops and elevated on poles,
were borne back in triumph. His reputation called, to the
ranks of so distinguished a commander, a band of brave men, J.

3. The fervour of patriotism was animated by the bounty
of . one hundred pounds each, offered ‘by the government for
those bloody trophies, not often taken’ from a living enemy;
In the month of May, in the year 1725, withbforty-six men,
he commenced the expedition which terminated his military
career. ‘ T _, ,_ - T '
‘ 4. Two of these soldiers, becoming lame", ,r='etu'rnedr; an-
other, falling sick, was left with the surgeon, anda’-guard and
eight men, in a stocldade fort, erected partly as a place of se-
curity for the sick, and partly, Witha wise providence against
misfortune, as a retreat; With the remaining _t-hi'rty-.fouf, he
continued his march northward, until the morning of the
eighth day of the month. V - ' _ '

5. It was While engaged_ in the devotional exercises. of
their morning worship_, that the report of a musket echoed
through the‘forest,,and they"'discovered an Indian, in pursuit
of‘ his game,—-5sta'n'di»ng‘ alone uponﬁa narrow point of land ex-

_t“encling“into the_'Péquaw’ket lake, on the. side opposite to‘

their encampment.  T

._ ‘ 6. T_,hus,appr_ized__of the neighbourhood of their foe, they
"laid aside theirpackis, and prepared for the encounter. They

advanced, _.en_co_mpass'ing. the lake in their course, andarrived

at thehead of. the peninsula. The savage had awaited them,

either ignorant of their approach, as, from the most authentic
accounts, is most probable; or, with thespirit of a Curtius, de-‘
voting himself, as some have supposed, to inevitable‘ destruc
tion, that -he mightallure the English to a pos~itio'n', where
defeat would be certain. , '
;\«.— He received their ﬁre; but, before he fell, returned it
with so deadly an effect, that the captain and another soldier

“were mortally wounded. The party, having secured their

victim," returned towards the spot where they had left their
packs. * But theircourse had crossed the path of the red

men, who had 3f'ollo.vved, and, having seized the spoil,.knew_
thenumber of their toes, and, when Lovell and his company"

approached, they rose from the earth with an exulting yell’,
and showered their death-shot fast upon the devoted band. -
8. The white men retreated, and, protected by the natural
defences ofthe» _situation to which necessity had driven them,
and ‘sheltered’ by’ those pines which still hear the scars’.-of the

battle,"fnaintaine,d thernselves for a Whole day, with heroic’

reso1ut._ion, _aga.inst an overwhelming, force. Although invited

to surrender, by the display of long ropes, which, in the ex

pressive language of signs, told them of the luxuries of cap- ‘

tivity, they fought with a determination to meet a quick’ and
honourable death, rather than toexpire amid the torments of
a protracted martyrdom. -

_ 9. Night at length arrived, a.nd the savages, weary of the
contest, and disheartened by the loss of their chief, and of
more than three fourths of their warriors, and despairing of
overcoming such obstinate resistance, retired, and the miser-
able remnant of their opponents, who survived the battle,
were suﬂered to escape. ,

10. It was no time then for indulging nice feeling% of del-
icacy. Of all those who had knelt before their Creator at the
dawn, sixteen only could bow in adoration at evening, to
pour forth their thanksgivings to their Preserver, that, amid
such perils, they had escaped unhurt; ten were gone to their
ﬁnal account, and eight were groaning with the agony of
rnnrtal wounds. .

l. The conjunoture did not admit of delay; while they
yet »aused, the bullet might be aimed at their own hearts——
they could not wait longer, to pay the last tribute of respect
to their dead companions, lest they, too, should sleep in~their
last repose——they could not delay, to sympathize with those
whose life was fast ebbing out, for they might share their
fate. Silently they retired, and abandoned both.

12. Some of the wounded gathered strength to crawl from
the spot where they fell, to perish more miserably from pu-
trefaction and starvation. A situation more miserable cannot
be imagined. They had sustained the labours of the day
without food, for their stores had been captured with their
packs, at the place of their morning repast, and they endured
the cold of night without a covering.

13. The moon shone forth brilliantly, and they lay, faint
and expiring, suffering the gnawings of hunger, the torment-
ings of thirst, and the agonies of pain, abandoned by their
friends, forsaken by the hope of escape, while the light dis-
iciosed the ghastly countenances and mangled forms of the
slain, and the wind bore to their ears the shouts of the sav-
ages, ﬁerce as the shrieks of ﬁends.

14. Heavily must that long, long night have passed, to
those who waited till death, stealing slowly over their ex-
hausted frames, should soothe their -miseries; and gloomily
rose the dawn on the eyes, which were yet unglazed and
unrlimmed by the thick ﬁlm.

NATIONAL READER, av

.15. Incidents occurred duringrthe conﬂict, which marked
the temper of the combatants. Such was the single combat
of Paugus, the chieftain, with Chamberlain, a soldier, both
men of undaunted courage of mind, and gigantic proportions
of body. Their guns had become too foul for further use,
and both went down to the water’s brink to. wash them, at
the same moment. "i ' , _

16. Standing near each. other, they exchanged words of
mutual deﬁance, and loaded their pieces with corresponding
motions. It*'is said, as Paugus forced down the ball, he
called out to his opponent, “ Me kill you quick.” “ May-be
not,” was the laconic reply; and the gun of Chamberlain
priming itself, gave him opportunity to falsify the prediction

' of the savage, whose ba.ll passed over the white ‘man with
the erring aim of a dying foe. . ' . .

17. It is also said, while Chamberlain was taking deadly
aim, the Indian called, to acquaint him that he had omitted
the motion, whos.e anticipation was so fatal_ to the chief: it
might have 'b_ee_’n from a magnanimity, notvery consistent
with the character of the red hunters ;‘ or it might have been
fromthe exultation of expected conquest, when he supposed
his enemy neglected what was so necessary, at a moment

1 when mistake or neglect could not be‘ retrieved. it i“ *

18. Captain Lovell, mortally wounded by the shot of the
single Indian, at the commencement‘ of the battle, received
another ball. He fell and expired, with eight more of his
~ company, killed by the first discharge, and the command .de-
volved on Lieutenant Wy'man, who‘ ‘sustained the conflict
during the day, and survived the hardships of thefmarch.

 19. The preservation of a soldier named Kies was little
less than miraculous. Covered with Wounds, exhausted with
fatigue, and faint from the loss of blood, he rolled himself
with diﬂiculty into a birch canoe, providentially lying by the
spot, not with the hope of escape, but that his remains might
be preserved from horrible mutilation. ' L _

88 INTRODUCTION TO THE

532. Such are the particulars of a battle, which was of in-
calculable advantage to the infant settlements. From that
period the slumbers of the cradle were no more broken by
the war-whoop, and the father, when he laid his head on the
pillow, no longer feared that the shouts of murderous savages
would rise around the cottage.

23. The place is now almost daily visited by strangers,
who, with a reverence due to departed valour, perform a pil-
grimage to the spot where its highest efforts have been per-
formed. On the shore of the pond, a sandy beach spreads
out, covered with aged trees, and bounded on one side by a
meadow, and terminated by an inconsiderable brook, which ,
being swollen, in the spring time, by the waters poured from
the dissolving snows of the mountains, forms a narrow pen-
insula.

24. Here the small company, engaged in this celebrated
and rash expedition, retreated, with the savages on their front
and ﬂank, and the waters on their right and rear, and con-
tinued the work of death, till the enemy, learning too late
that the desperation of the few is mightier than the courage
of the many, retired, leaving the survivors of the ﬁght to
enjoy a triumph gained by the loss of more than half their
number.

25. It is not by the inconsiderable forces engaged in this
battle, that we are to estimate its consequences. It should
be remembered, that the Indians, irritated by a long series of
injuries, and with a strong effort to stem the torrent of deso-
lation, which was sweeping over their hopes, had dug up the
hatchet, and, to the hardships of a settlement in the wilder-
ness, were added the horrors of a ruthless warfare.

26. The pilgrim of those days listened, in the still watches
of the night, for the footfall of the invaders; the musket was
the companion of histoils and of his pillow, and too often
the ﬁerce yells of unsparing foes came on the silence, and

the ﬂames rose from his dwelling, and his children were,

murdered, and himself carried into captivity, to expire in the
tortures inflicted in the sportiveness of cruelty.

27. The defeat of a hundred was, to them, even as the
slaughter of the thousands, on the blood-stained‘ field of Wa-

-. terloo, to the conqueror of Europe. It broke their spirit, and

from that hour the star of the nation grew pale, till it went
out in darkness. g.‘

were niany andi’melanielioly.. .He went down  ‘calmly on

the eve of that long day of carnage;-—the wind sighed as
mournfully through the evergreens of the forest-—the Waters
curled as gently——t.he murmur that came on the departing
twilight was as sad—-and the woods waved with a motion
as gracefulas they now do. . _' 4 _

29. But‘, then, the last rays of fading light" fell on eyes that

were soon. to be closed in eternal darkness——-the breeze minu-

gled its solemn wail with the groans of the dy_i,ng::__soldier—-
the waters-‘rolled along, stained‘ with the red current of life,
and the trees shaded. the cold c6r_ses of the slain. ' '
30. ,All around was so calm and still, that it were an insult
to nature to make so lovely a solitude the scene of conten-
tion. and to.ofi"‘er human sacriﬁces on the purpled altar of
violence. The sounds of merriment, the rejoicing of mirth,
the pleasant song, or the sprightly dance, were more.in..har-
mony with the quiet ‘beauty of the spot, than the rude con-
fusion of warfare., and the desolation of slaughter.-’ .-
‘31. It was Well that the ﬂoods had come,_and washed the
soil from the red stains, and the storms had‘ spread out the
white sands over the ‘spot where they had ‘fought. ‘ A hun-

dred years have gone by, and, as yet, no monument’ has been A

raised to preserve to posterity the memory of the pla e »of_

n  The gratitude of a century has done nothing to per; et~
nate the names of those who have ‘added to the inheritance
of ourhonours. Long after the warriors had fallen, and after
the eagle and the wolf had been gorged with their mortal re-
mains, thescattered relics weregathered, and buried at the
foot of anaged pine.

33. The ﬁre has since scathed its branches, and blasted its .
verdure; the trunk has decayed, and each traveller carries’

away a f1'agme11t ﬂ'orn its stump as a memen’to of his visit;
so that, ere long, no mark will remain to distinguish the
graves of the vfalleﬁn, and tofwarn us that we do not profane,
with our footsteps, the earth which covers their lowly’ beds.

Battle between two Sizdlces : related by an Amerz7ctm Farmer.-»
CABINET or CURIOSITIES. 5 - -

,1. As I was one day sitting in my arbour, my attention

was engagediby a strange sort of rustling noise at some paces i i
i ._ as i A  w 

90 I NTR.ODUC'I.‘l0N T0 'l‘.H'E

distant. I looked around, and to my astonishment, I beheld
two snakes, of considerable length, the one pursuing the other
with great celerity through -a hemp stubble-ﬁeld. 2. The
aggressor was of the black kind, six feet long; the fugi-
tive was a water snake, nearly of equal dimensions. They
soon met, and, in the fury of their first encounter, they ap-
peared in an instant ﬁrmly twisted together; and whilst
their united tails ‘beat the ground, they tried with open jaws
to lacerate each other. 3. What a fell aspect did they pre-
sent! Their heads were compressed to a verysmall size;
their eyes ﬂashed ﬁre; and, after this conflict had lasted about
ﬁve minutes, the second found means to disengage itself
from the first, and hurried toward a ditch. 4. Its antagonist
instantly assumed a new posture, and, half creeping and half
erect, with a majestic mien, overtook and attacked the other
again, which placed itself in the same attitude, and prepared
to resist. .5. The scene was uncommon and beautiful; for
thus opposed, they fought with their jaws, biting each other
with the utmost rage; but, notwithstanding this appearance
of mutual courage and fury, the water snake still seemed de-
sirous of retreating toward the ditch, to its natural element.
6. This was no sooner perceived by the keen-eyed black
one, than, twisting its tail twice round a -stalk of hemp and
seizing its adversary by the throat, not by means of its jaws,
but by twisting its own neck twice round that of the water
snake, it pulled the latter back from the ditch. 7. To pre-
vent a defeat, the water snake took hold likewise of a stalk
on the bank, and, by the acquisition of that point of resist-
ance, became a match for its ﬁerce antagonist. 8. Strange
was this to behold; two great snakes, strongly adhering to
the ground, fastened together by means of the writhings
which lashed ‘them to each other, and stretched at their full
length! 9. They pulled, but pulled in vain; and, in the mo-
ments of their greatest exertion, that part of their bodies
which was entwined seemed extremely small, while the rest
appeared inﬂated, and now and then convulsed with strong
undulations, rapidly following each other. 10. Their eyes
seemed on ﬁre, and ready to start out of their heads: at one
time, the conflict seemed decided; the water snake bent it-
self into two great folds, and, by that operation, rendered the
other more than commonly outstretched. 11. The next min-
ute the new struggles of the black one gained an unexpected
superiority; it acquired two great folds likewise, which na-

c..essa.rily extended the body of its adversary, in proportion as

NATIONAL READER. 91

it had contracted its own. 12. These efforts were alternate,
victory seemed doubtful, inclining sometimes to the one side,
and sometimes to the other; until, at last, the stalk, to which
the black snake was f‘astened, suddenly gave way, and, in
consequence of this accident, they both plunged into the ditch.
13. The water did not extirimiish their vindictive rage; for,
by their agitations, I could triice, though not distinguish, their
mutual attacks. 14., They soon re-appeared on the surface,
twisted together, as in their first onset; but the black snake
seemed to retain its wonted superiority, for its head was ex-
actly ﬁxed above that of the other, which he incessantly

ressed down under the water until it was stifled and sunk.
 The victor no sooner percieived its enemy incapable of
further resistance, than, abandoning it to the current, it re»
turned on shore, and disappeared.

LESSON LII.
Saturday Aft_crn0on.—N. P. WILLIs.*“

I LOVE to look on a scene like this,
Of wild and careless play,

And persuade myself that I am not old,
And my locks are not yet gray;

For it stirs the blood in an old man’s heart,
And it makes his pulses fly,

To catch the thrill of a happy voice,
And the light of a pleasant eye.

I have walked the world for fourscore years;
And they say that I am old, _

And my heart is ripe for the reaper, Death,
And my years are well nigh told.

It is very true; it is very true;
I’m old, and “ I ’bide my time ;”

But my heart will leap at a scene like this,
And I half renew my prime.

Play on, play on; I am with you there,
In the midst of your merry ring;

I can feel the thrill of the daring jump.
And the rush of the breathless swing.

I hide with you in the fragrant hay,

_ And I whoop the smothered call,

And my feet slip up on the seedy ﬂoor,
And I care not for the fall.

I am willing to die when my time shall come,
And I shall be glad to go;

For the world, at best, is a weary place,
And my pulse is getting low :

But the grave is dark, and the heart will fail
In treading its gloomy way;

And it wiles my heart from its dreariness,
To see the young so gay. I

Moses in the Bulrushes.-—ANoNYMoUs.

IN Judah’s hall the harp is hushed;
Her voice is but the voice of pain;
The heathen heel her helm has crushed;
Her spirit wears the heathen chain:
From the dark prison-house she cried,
“How long, 0 Lord, thy sword has slept l
O, quell the oppressor in his pride!”
Still Pharaoh ruled, and Israel wept.

The morning breezes freshly blow,
The waves in golden sunlight quiver;
A Hebrew mother wanders slow
Beside the mighty idol river;
A babe within her bosom lay——
And must she plunge him in the deep?
hhe raised her eyes to heaven, to pray——-
She turned them down to earth, to weep.

. She knelt: down by the swelling tide,

’Mid rushes dank, and flowerets wild;
Beneath the plane-tree’s shadow wide,
The weeping mother placed her child.
“Peace be around thee: though thy bed
A mother’s breast no more may be,
Yet III»: that shields the lily’s head,
Deserted babe, will watch o’er thee!”

NATIONAL READER. 93

4. She’s gone! that mourning mother, gone l--

List to the sound of dancing feet.,—-

And, lightly bounding, one by one,
A lovely train their timbrels beat.

’Tis she of Egypt———Pharaoh’s daughter-—
That, with her maidens, comes, to lave

Her form of beauty in the water,
And light with beauty’s glance the wave.

. Oh‘. woman’s heart is like the rose,
That glows beneath the tropic’s ﬂame,
That blooms as sweet ’mid northern snows,
For ever lovely, and the same.
VVhate’er her rank, whate’er her lot,
Where’er her gentle inﬂuence ranges,
The art to bless is ne’er forgot,
The will to comfort never changes.

6. The monarch’s daughter saw, and wept
(How lovely falls compassion’s tear l)
The babe that there in quiet slept,
Blessed in unconsciousness of fear.
’Twas hers to pity and to aid
The infant chief, the infant sage:
Undying fame the deed repaid,
Recorded upon heaven’s own page.

7. Years pass away——the land is free !-—-
Daughter of Zion, mourn no more!
The oppressor’s hand is weak on thee,
Captivity’s dark reign is o’er.
Thy chains are burst, thy bonds are riven;
On, like a river strong and wide!
A captain is to Judah given-E-
The babe that slept by Nile’s broad tide.

Which I should never like to losgg, if it belonged to me:
