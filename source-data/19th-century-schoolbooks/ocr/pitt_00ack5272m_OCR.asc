iv             The PREFACE.
tords, Sentences, and Speebches, are compofed.  As to their
Shape or Form, thofe commonly ufed in the Engli/h, Latin,
German, French, Spanij#, Portugueze and Italian Languages,
are defcribed in the firit Page of this Bock.  As to their Numter, in Bngyjh, they are F,wucn'-fx. As to their Divi/fon, they
are naturally divided into Yowvels and Cnlcbonants: and again
into fngle and double Letters.
As to SSyllables: A Syllable is the uniting one or more Confonants with a Vowel, by which each Letter receives its perfeat
Sound in Pronunciation; as you may find in the Examples of
the fecond and third Pages.
As to Woords: They confiR of one or more Syllables, and are
given us by the all-wife God, as a Means by which not only
one Man may make his own Thioughts known to another, but
that we thereby may alfo arrive to the Knowledge of the Will
of Him our Creator, revealed in the facred Oracles of his Divine Word. Wherefore,
Seeing that the Ufe of Letters, Syllables and'ords is of fo
great Confequence to human Creatures, what Care fhould be
taken to {hew that we have acquired a true Knowledge thereof,
by. giving each Letter its proper Place, each Syllable its right
Divifiorn and true Accent, and each Word its natural Sound;
which will certainly guide every one to a juft Cadence of their
Sentences; without which no one can pretend to write or read
intelligibly to others.  And,
Yet by daily Experience it is found that even many, who
lave attained to the Art of writing a good Hand, are fo unfortunate in Spelling, that neither themfelves, nor the more
knowing can guefs at the Meaning, couched under fuch a prepollerous jumble of Letters fet for V'ords.  Becaufe, having
never been taught the general Force or Power and Sound of the
JEnglijb Letters, nor the cutlomaiy and various Ufes of Diphthongs; not to rerltion their total Ignorance of the Deri.vatioen
cf Words, they neither fpell accolding to Cuja1m, Sound nur
Derirzaticn. Wherefore, for the fake of fuch unhappy Schoc.ars,
and as much as in me lies, to prevent the Growvvth of fuch an
Evil,
I have in the following Sheets colle&amp;Ecd as many different
Forms cf Spelling, as the Englzj'h Tcrgue affords in common
Pradtice.  And a,s Mlor:g/q.lables not only make the greateft
Part of our Tongue, but are the fubrtantial Parts of all Words
of more than one S)iiablk, I have been the more particularly
careful to reduce them into fuch an Order, as at the fame tinle

in the right Knowledge of the moft common and ufeful Parts of

it would be cruel in Behaviour, to bid a Child take Care how
it comes up Stairs, and then to beat it, becaufe it cannot firide
up feven or eight Steps at once.
Again: If-it be realbnable in the Order of Words to begin
with thofe of one Syllable, as all Spelling tiuthors agree: it mufl:
be alfo granted as realonable, that AMoo,yllables, which confift

Order, proceeding gradually from  Words of t'wo Letters to

Q. HZcwThe PREFACE.
thellefs I have kept up the true Senfe, tho' I have taken the
Liberty to a'lter the Expreffion.
d4gain: It muft be ackniowledged that the firft Si'x Le/~n do
but juft mnake Enzglzj'h: yet, I hope, whoever confiders the
Difficulty of compofing Sentences to be read -in Ly/'sns, wherein
each Word is confined to th2ree Letters, will readily over-lock
the Bafenefs of the Language, it not being our Province to teach
the Politenefs of Style, but only to pr-ovidie prope-r Materials, of
which all Didionot is coranpofed.  Yet great Care is takecn to
avoid all fuch Wilords in every, Par-t of this Boo,k, which milghtI
tend to excite loefe and difor-derly Thoughts, or put Youth or
Mvodetty to the Blufhi: and all miy Tables are filled wvithi the
ealieff Wford's in our Language; even frch aos a Child may have
fome id'ea of, at the firti P;ron unciation.  Moreo)Ver,1 as vve wrive
mnany Words in Eng/zi4whic'h agree with Or:ho,graphl  wu dIf~e
in Sounzd, I have adnioniflised the Learnier thereof, by inc~olhsg!10
fuch Wfords within a Par,enthefis, thius (done) (gone) (no-ne.) as
at the Bottom of Page so.  
Having thus with much Pain, colled'ed Mlon,'ilallies, wvhicla
are the moft ufeful Part of our Language,~ and reduce-d the is
ix (uch an Order-, as feem'd to me to f'erve the Proe  fa
eafy 1nfruJ'Iion, much better than any of thofe Co!iee&amp;?iOns pobliflV before this Time;, I mufft affuire you, that miy Care hais
beefflqually as much concerned how to facilitate the cornpouin'ding and dividing fuch Wfords as confiil of more Syllables
than one. For this Purpofe I have confulted the Method of
fpelling or dividing Syllables in long, Words, both) according to
their Sound, and to the Rules of Grammar: Anid thierefore in
the Perufal of this Effay towards Spelling, you will find that
whenever a WVord occurs that may be divided one way by Sound,
and another by Grammar; the Scholar is dir-eaed how to under-ftand the doub Jul Div Jo-n, by this Mlark (d)over the right
Sidle of the Vo'wel, whichl according to t-he Sounzd, ought to hejoined with the following Conifbniant, wvhic.h is neve theiellfs contrary to the Rules of Grammar; and therefore div$11ed in fuch
a Ma'nner as you find them printed.
A-nd as to the L~/7fes proper to each Table of Wo'rds of many.Syllailes, the fame Care has been continued, not to admit any
kVord to be read in the fame, but fuc1h only as fnall belonlg "_0
fome of the foregoing. Tables.  And I hople it wiil be e"lieemed
a Perfe7i'on, that I have om-itted al'l fupe:fluous HI4re:-w andt
o4n~eNames, and not detained, the Learnier from thle Attainment of mnore ufeful Words, by IIL.pping IhI6 P;oJ-grCfS in Sear-ca

Scholars in the moit neceffary Parts of Literature.  And,Here I fhould finifh my Accou*t of this firft Part of Spelling,
was it not my Province to explode that erroneous Pretence of
teaching Children to fpell altogether by the Ear. In Oppofitioa
to which, I will fairly afk thofe'eachers, Whether their Scholars
did ever attain to a right Judgment of Spelling by that Method,
till they were afterwards better inlfruEted according to Rule?
And if this be true, as moft certainly it is, that there can be
no true Method of Spelling without Rule, I will appeal to my
Readers, how inconfifent it is firf to teach by theforrmer Way,
thofe aThings which afterwards can never be attained but by
the latter.  Certainly every one will join with me in this Particular, that it ii the greateft Folly in the World to learn
Things, that afterwards mult he learned in an other Manner.
Co,ofequently I nlay prefume to be infirumental in teaching
Children to pronounce- their Words clear and diflin&amp;, without
t'ones or di/lorted Countenances, which ill Habits, it is well
known, are too frequently contra&amp;ed under fuch bad Methods
of Inflrution, which I have endeavoured to root out: HIits,.
which, it is too true to be concealed, as it were, perfecute; the
Learners thro' the different Stages of Life: For, having been
accutfomed to a bad Tone in their early Pronunciation,, arefcarce ever able afterwards to quit their lamentable Way of
reading with Hems and Hahs.
The Second Part contains fuch Words, which tho' they
agree in Sound, differ in Signifcation; and therefore the Learner
ought to be well acquainted with them, in order to prevent
his writing one Word. for another, of the fame Sound.
The Third Part is a Compendium of Englijh Grammar, defigned only.r Englij# Schools, to enable fuch as are intendedto rife no higher, to write their Mether-Tongue intelligibly,
and according to the Rules of Grammar: And 1 hope it will
anfwer the End propofed. But,
As Praatice in all Arts and Sciences, is the great Medium of
In irut?ion between Mafler and Scbolar, I would advife all. eachers, when they find their Learners relifh the Rales of this Part,

the Rules herein contained towards procuring a good Style, anit
an eafy Way of wiriting: and banifh from their Lyes fuch
Grubflreet Papers, idle Pam.phlets, lewcd Plays, filthy Songs, and
unfee   efls, which ferve oniv to corrupt and debauch the
Printples of thofe, who are fo unhappy as to fpend their Time
thereinr
The Fourth Part contains feveral divine, moral, and hiftorical Sentences, both in Profe and Verfe, and feveral ufeful and
eafy Fables, with their Morals; which may not only ierve the
Mafter to exercife hlis Scholars with, by way of Evening Copies;
but may render the Bufinefs of Reading as ufeful and pleaj/nt as
poflible to the Learner.
The Ffifh Part is founded upon that excellent Order of all
Charity Schools, in thefe Donminions, which obliges every Miayder
to join with his Scholars in Prayer, both Alorning and Evening;
teaching them thereby, as is intended, that all their I)epen -
dence is on God, by wuhom wve live and move, and have our
Being. Therefore, I have here publiffied feveral fhort Forms of
Prayer for their Afliftance in this Divine Exercife.
And now to conclude: " The Knowledge of Letters, -(fays
-' the celebrated Dr. WATTS) is one of the greateft Bleffings
g" that ever God bellowed on the Children of Men: By this
" Aieams, we preferve for our own Ufe, thro' all our Lives,.at our Memory would have loft in a few Days, and lay up
-rich Treafure of Knowledge for thofe that ihall come after, us. By the Arts of Reading and PWriting, we can fit at Home,i and acqsaint ourfelves with what is donein all the diitant,' Parts of the World, and find what our Fathers did long ago,
" in the firit Ages of Mankind. By this Means a Briton holds,' Correfpondence with his Friend in XAmerica or 7rapan, and,' manages all hisBufinefs.'Tis this which brings all the pail
" Ages of Men at once upon the Stage, and makes the molt di-, Rant Nations and Ages converfe together, and grow into,, Acquaintance. And it is this, by which God has difcovered
"' his Power and Juftice, his Providence, Mercy and Grace,
t" that we who live near the End of Time, may larn the Way
" to Heaven and everlafting HIappienfs."

A   Defie to e::cei others in NVirtue, is very commendable;
and a De'light in obtaining Praife, defcrves Encouragement, becaufe itdifcovers an excellent Mind: But he is wicket
who emplo;s his Thoughts only to out-going the nwor't in \;'
lanv.  Such a Ccntention is diabolical.
2. A wife Man values Pleafure at a very little Rate, becaufe
i5 is the Dane of the Mind, and the Caufe of all Miferv: Bau:
hle values no Pofi-?ion more than Vir-tue, becaufe it is the Fountain of all public an1d private Happinefs.
3- B.Lat not of thy Health and Strength too much: only,uhil'L thou enjoveli them, give Praife to him that befttoweth ai!
good Things upon all Men. Ufe them well, left Like deprive
thee of them. God doti give to thee, return Ihim not Evil.
4. By the Fall of,idamn from that glorious and happy State,
wh}erein he was created, the divine Image on his Mind is quite
changed and altered, arind he, who was created but a little int:rior to the Angels above, is now made but little fupcrior to
the Angels belo;i.
5. Children are fuch as their Inftitution: Infancy is led altogether by lmitation; it hath neither Words nor Adions but
what are infufed by others: If it have good or ill Language, it
is borrowed; and the Shaine or Thanks are only due to tleir.
that lent themn.
6. Coretoufnefs b;ings nothing Home.  Sometimes Men,
are fo blinded with Avarice, that they contradia theimfelves,
and lofi what is honeiily due to them, by coveting what is not
ju!ily their own, and thereby give others an OpEortunity of deceiving them.                                  t..
7. Do not the Work of God negligently; and -lpt not your
Heart bI upon the World, when your Fland is L.fted up in.
Prayer: For that Time, you may be confident, is gained, %,hieD
is prudently and Z:aiouL  y fpent in God's Service.

S. Divine Providence difpcfes.11 Things moft wif!ly; not
enly irn what concerns the WVorld in general, but c,,r)y one of
us in particular: So that inrt whon Condition foeer he puts us,
we may affure ourfelves that it is bell for us, fine He chufes it,
who cannot err.
9. Ever fince the Tranf'.refficn of our firl Parents, the Purity of lIuLn n Nature hath been miferably fained; its Facalties ha,ve been fadvy depraved; an-] its Aftec&amp;ions very liable ta
be deluded, ini;eliCed, and, barccme by the Wo.ld.
Io..Enquire nor into the Sc-rets ot God, bat be content to
karn youlr Dut' accord'ng  t t(  e QLality of your Perlon or
Employr.ment. -God's Com.n'andments were procla:inied to l,ll
the Wonrld   but his Counfet's are to. i'z;f'et, and his Secret
ones, when thle are adm.tted widtkn t'e Veil.
I. Flat-ter not t-e'lf that you have Faith t;o'nr s God,.
iFyou want Charity toward your Neighlbour; for the one is a.
certain Egfe&amp; of the other.  Neither follow a Multitude to Sin,.

1i. Gold' tho' the nsob.!e  of Metals, lolthll its Luftre when.

Water to one in a burning Fever; which does him more Hfrris.

14. IETap?y is he who allows himifel Time and Leifure to
make his Peace with God, and fign a Truce w,ith' Ileaven; but.
~nore ttL be admired is he, who is obliged to live in the midll of'i'emptatic,ns, and yet. can be in Love with Religion to the lait
M1oment of his Life.
-5-. He that only pleafes himfelf, does himfelf po Kindnefs,.
becaufe he difp!eafes G:,d hi, Creator, who comniands us to be
kind and good to all Men, and. to do to others thofe Things
w-hich we are willing ihould be done to ourfelves.
15. Ifthey go down to the Pit, that do not feed the Hungry,
aid. clothe the NakeXd; what wvill become of thofe that take
a:vay Bread from the Hungry, and Clothes from  the lnaked?
if W  irt of Charity he tLor.mrn.ted. in. elel,, what, will becolme

to the Study of good Letters; they will be always ufeful to him;
they will p:ocure him the Favour and Love of good Men,
which thofe that are wife, value nmocre than Riches and Pleafures.
iS. King Dariuj's Mother,, when fle heard of the Death of
d4]exa,ader, laid violent Hands upon herfclf; not that Ihe preferred an Enemy before a Son, but becaufe fhe had experienced
the Duty of a Son in him, whom Offe had feared as an Enemy.
i9. Let us never mcalure our Godlinefs. by the Number of
Sermons which we hear, but by the Fruit we bring forth; without which, all our Hearing will 1erve but to bring us into that
Portion of Stripes, which belorngs to him:h.at ras.ws bis Mnafer's

zo. Lazy Folks take the moft Pains.  Some People are fe
carelefs, that they will run all Hazard., rather than help tlher..1felves at the Expence of a little Trouble; and it generally happens, that they are the greateft Sufferci's in the Conclufion.
2. Men are generally governed more by Appearences than
Realities; and the impudent Man in his Air and Behaviour,
undertakes for himfelf that he has Ability and Merit, while thenlodelt or diffident gives himfelf up as one who is poffeffed of
neither.
2z. Many Men are grown fo negligent of feeking divine
Mvercy betimes, that they put that off to the laft, which fliould
have been the firit Part of their Bufinefs; and many Times.
their Life is at an End, before they begin their Repentance.
23. No Man is fo profperous and happy, but he has fome
unfortunate and fad Days; and on the centrary no Man is fo
miferahle, kuut he has fome Times of Refrefhmenr.  Profperity
and Adverfity, by turns, fucceed one another, as Rain does fair
WVeather, and fair Weather Rain.
24. Nothing i5 more abfurd than; to extend our Hopes and
Defires, our Projcds and Defigns for this World, beyond the
Term   of our living here: And it is unreafonable for us to.
t:ouble ourfelves about this World longer than we are like to
continue in it.
z5. Obedience comprehendeth the whole Duty of a Man,.
both towards God, his Neighbour, and himfelf; ye fbould.
therefore let it be engraven on our Hearts, that we may be ufef1l in the Common-Wealth, and loyal to our Magifirates.;6. Our Life is a Warfare,, and this'World a Place of Mai:ieics wherein the greateft Garlands are aloticd to them w ho
fOLainA Nrw G         I D E
ful'ain the greatefi Labours: For by the Smart of our Stripes
is augmented the Glory of our Reward.
27. Pride is a very remarkable Sin; and often'.meets with
very extraordinary Judgments, even in this Life; but will certainly be punilihed in the next: Forif God fpared not the Angels fbr this Sin, but cal th.eni into Hell, let no Man hope to
ipeed better.
28. Perfonal Merit is all a Man can call his own. lWhoever
ftriWldy adheres to Iionefty and Truth, and leads a regular an.i
virtuous Life, is mnore truly ncble than a debauched abandonz-d
Pr.ofligate, wele he de!fended fiorm tile molt illultrious Fa29. Riches are like Dung, which flink in an Heap; but
being fpread abroad, make the Earth fiuitful. It is but nicie
Fancy to defire and efleem Riches, except it be for the fake *f,
ufing them. The belR Metals lofe their Luftre, unlefs brighten'd
by Ufe.
30. Repentance, tho' it is not to be relied in as any SatisfaEtion for Sin, or any Caufe of the Pardon thereof, wvhich is
the Ait cf God's free Grace in Chrift; yet it is of fuch Neceffity to all Sinners, that none may exped Pardon without it.
3I. St. Beirnard, in his Youth being troubled with a Pain in
his Head, a certain VWoman profered to cure him, by reciting
a few Verfes by way of Charmin; but he refufed, faying, I had
rather endture the I-and of God, than be cbred ly the Hand of tbe
Devz.il.
32. Servants fhould not deal worfe with their Alalers far
dealing better with theln, but confcionablv do their Worlk, that
the Proverb may not be verified in them' He that/ys his Ser-'vant's Ciages a/freba,ad, cuti J   his rtight Arm; that is, occafions him to be flothful and lazy.
3.'fThe Lawfulnefs of our- Adions may not be judged by
the Events, but by the Grom.nds: The wife and holy Arbiter
cf the WTorld knows why, miiany times, the better Caute hath
the worfe Succefs: Many a juthilufinefs is croffred for a Puniillsent to the Agent.
34. Trade is i() noble a Maller, that it is willing to entertain all Mankind in its Service; and has fucli a Variety of Employments adapted to every Capacity, that all, but the Lazy,
niay lupport at lealt, if not enrich thenlmflves.
35. Time i. one of the moit precious I'alents in the World,
which the.iuthor of it has committed to our M.anagement! So
precious, thlat he gives it us by Drops; nor ever affords us two
Momnentsto the ENGLISH TONGUL.
13r
Moments at once; but always takes away one, when he lets us
lhave another.
36. Very wholefome Advice was that, which was given by a
Heathen Philofopher, viz. Make it no longer a Matter'f Di./ute,,what are the MAarks and Signr of a ri ghteous Man, but immediately
Jet about it, and endea-vour to become fuch an One.
37. Virtue ( faid a vicious Man on his Death-Bed ) as much
outlhines Vice in Splendor and Light, as the glorious Luminary of Heaven, which runs its daily Courfe in the lofty Sky, does
that fmall Rufli-Light which fiands glimmering by my Bed's
Side.
38. Vain Glory deftroys all the Fruits of a good A&amp;ion. He
that prays, or gives Alms to be feen of Men, muft take that
as his Reward; nor nuft he expeat any other from Heaven,
but the Portion of thofe Hypocrites that love the Praife of Men,
more than the Praife of God.
39. Upbraid no Man's Weaknefs to difcomfort him, nor re.
port it to him to difparage him; neither delight to remember it
to leffen him, or fet thyfelfabove him. And be fure never
to praife thyfe'i, or to difpraife any Man elfe, unlefs God's
Glory, or fomen good End do hallow it.
40. W'icked Breafits aie falfe to themrfelves; neither trufting
to their own Choice, nor making Choice of that, which they
dare to truil-. They'will iet a good Face upon their fecretly
unpleafing Sins; and had iather be felf-condemned, than wife
and prudent.
41. We ought neitli r to be fo eager ~fr hoarding up Trea.
fure, as to with-holJ cus Hand entirely fi-m giving; nor yet
fo care'efs and extravagant, as to let any Thing be unprofitably loit, which might be ufeful to ourfelves, or beneicial to
others.
42. Your.g Minds being fulleft of Ignorance want InflruAion
mcoit; are fitteft to receive it, as being freeft from Prejudices,
and w(orldiy Cares; and are apt to retain it belt, being void of
fuch Correntions as would otherwife expel it.

At the fame Time the Wolf happened to be behind the

Some Time after the Goat's Departure, the Wolf knocks
at the Door, and counterfeiting the Goat's Voice, demands
Entrance.
The Kid, fuppofing it to be her Dam, forgot to look out at

LEi:S SON   I.
IT is God that girdeth mie with Strength of War,
and ma'keth my Way perfe&amp;L
Hie -maketh my Feet like Harts Feet; anid fetteth
me up on higyh.
My Foe-s fhall cry, buit there mhall he none to help
them: Yea even unto the Lord fhiall they cry, but
he flhall not hear themi.
For this Caufe will I give Thlanks unto thee, 0
Lor~i, and fing, Praife unto thy Name.
L E:s so0NII
Unto thee, 0 Lord, will I lift up my Soul: My
God, I have put my Truff in thee.
Lead mie forth in thiy Truth, and learn me; for
thou ar-t the God of' mv Health: In thee. lath been
been my I-ope all the Day long.           Call,2 8Call to Mind, 0 I,ord, thy tender Mercy, which
hath been of old.
The Secret of the Lord is with them that fear
him; and he will fhew them his Law.
L ESSON      III.
Hear my Voice, 0 Lord, when I cry unto thee;
have Mercy on me, and hear me.
O hide not thou thy Face from me; nor caft thServant from thee in thy Wrath.
Teach me thy Way, O Lord, and lead me in the
right Way.
O my Soul, wait thou on the Lord; be ftrong,
and he ihall comfort thine lHeart; andi put thou thy
Truft in the Lord.
LE SSON I.s o N
Unto thee will I cry, O Lord, my Strength:
Think no Scorn of me, left if thou nmake as though
thou didff not hear, I be made like thenm that go
down into the Pit.
The Lord is my Strength and nmy Shield, my
Heart hath trufted in him, ani I am helped: Theirefore my I leart danceth for Joy, and in my Song
will I praife him.
LESS     N  V.
I fought the Lord, and he heard me: Yea, he
faved me out of all my Fear.
O tafte and fee how good the Lord is: Bleffed is
the Man that trufleth in him
O fear the Lord, ye that are his Saints: For they
that fear him, want no good Thing.
T'he Lions do want and fuffer much: But they
who feek the Lord, fhall want no Manner of Thing
that is good.

LESSON        VI.
What Man is he that lufteth to live, and would

he doth hear tihem when they pray.
The Lord doth fave the Souls of his Servants;
and all they that put their Truft in him, fhall not
want I-lelp.
