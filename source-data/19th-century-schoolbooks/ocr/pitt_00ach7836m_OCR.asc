77. TRUE SCIENCE OUGHT TO BE RELIGIOUS. -President Hitchcock
I AM far from maintaining that science is a sufficient guide in
religion. -On the other hand, if left to itself, as I fully admit,
"It leads to bewilder, and dazzles to blind."
Nor do I maintain that scientific truth, even when properly appreciated, will compare at all, in its influence upon the human mind, with
those peculiar and higher truths disclosed by Revelation. All I contend for is, that scientific truth, illustrating as it does the divine character, plans and government, ought to fan and feed the flame of true
piety in the hearts of its cultivators.  He, therefore, who knows the
most of science, ought most ppwerftllly to feel this religiou-s influence.
fHe is not confined, like the great mass of men, to the outer court of
Nature's magnificent temple; but he is admitted to the interior, and:allowed to trace its long halls, aisles and galleries, and gaze upon its
lofty domes and arches; nay, as a priest he enters the penetralia, the
holy of holies, where sacred fire is always burning upon the altars;
where hovers the glorious Schekinah; and where, from a full orchestra, the anthem of praise is ever ascending. Petrified, indeed, must
be his heart, if it catches none of the inspiration of such a spot. Ee
ought to go forth from it, among his fellow-men, with radiant glory
on his face, like Moses from the holy mount. Hle who sees most of'God in His works ought to show the stamp of Divinity upon his
character, and lead an eminently holy life.
Yet it is only a few gifted and adventurous minds that are able, froi
some advanced mountain-top, to catch a glimpse of the entire stream
of truth, formed by the harmonious union of all principles, and flowing on majestically into the boundless ocean of all knowledge, the
Infinite mind. But when the Christian philosopher shall be permitted
to resume the study of science in a future world, with powers of
investigation enlarged and clarified, and all obstacles removed, he will
be able to trace onward the various ramifications of truth, till they uni te
into higher and higher principles, and become one in that centre of
centres, the Divine Mind. That is the Ocean from which all truth
originally sprang, and to which it ultimately returns. To trace out
the shores of that shoreless Sea, to measure its measureless extent, and
to fathom its unfathomable depths, will be the noble and the joyous
work of eternal ages. And yet eternal ages may pass by, and see the
work only begaun!MORAL AND DIDACTIC. -JOHNSON.
78. TRIUMIPIIS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. - Rev. J. G. Lyons.
Now gather all our Saxon bards, - let harps and hearts be strung,
To celebrate the triumphs of our own good Saxopg tongue!
For stronger far than hosts that march, with battle-flags unfurled
It goes with FREEDOM, THiOUGHT and TRUTIH, to rouse and rule the
world.
Stout Albion hears its household lays on every surf-worn shore,
And Scotland hears its echoing far as Orkney's breakers roar;
It climbs New England's rocky steeps as victor mounts a throne,
Niagara knows and greets the voice, still mightier than its own.
It spreads where Winter piles deep snows on bleak Canadian plains;
And where, on Essequibo's banks, eternal Summer reigns.
It tracks the loud, swift Oregon, through sunset valleys rolled,
And soars where California brooks wash down their sands of gold.
It kindles realms so far apart, that while its praise you sing,
These may be clad with Autumn's fruits, and those with flowers of
Spring.
It quickens lands whose meteor lights flame in an Arctic sky,
And lands for which the Southern Cross hangs orbit fires on high.
It goes with all that Prophets told, and righteous Kings desired;
With all that great Apostles taught, and glorious Greeks admired;
With Shalcspeare's deep and wondrous verse, and Milton's lofty mind;
WVith Alfred's laws, and Newton's lore, to cheer and bless mankind.
Mark, as it spreads, how deserts bloom, and Error flees away,
As vanishes the mist of night before the star of day!
Take heed, then, heirs of Saxon fame, - take heed, nor once disgrace,
With recreant pen or spoiling sword, our noble tongue and race!
Go forth, and jointly speed the time, by good men prayed for long,
When Christian States, grown j ut and wise, will scorn revenge and
wrong;
When earth's oppressed and savage tribes shall cease to pine or roam,
All taught to prize these English words:-- FAIT, FREEDOM HlEAvW,

Drowsily flying, and weaving anew
Her dusky meshes o'er land and sea,
How gently, 0 sleep, fall thy poppies on me'
For I drink water, pure, cold, and bright,
And my dreams are of Heaven the livelong night.
So hurrah for thee, Water! hurrah! hurrah!
Thou art silver and gold, thou art riband and star
Hurrah for bright water! hurrah! hurrah!
80. TIE DAYS THAT ARE GONE.- Charles llackay
WHo is it that mourns for the days that are gone,
When a Noble could do as he liked with his own?  
When his serfs, with their burdens well filled on their backs
Never dared to complain of the weight of a tax?
When his word was a statute, his nod was a law,
And for aught but his " order " he cared not a straw?
When each had his dungeon and racks for the poor,
And a gibbet to hang a refractory boor?
rhey were days when the sword settled questions of right
And Falsehood was first to monopolize might;
I 00M60RAL.ND DIDACTIv.
When Law never dreamed it was good to relent,
)r thought it less wisdom to kill than prevent;
When Justice herself, taking Law for her guiae,
Was never appeased till a victim had died;
And the stealer of sheep and the slayer of men
Were strung up together, again and again.
They were days when the Crowd had no freedom of speech,
And reading and writing were out of its reach;
When Ignorance, stolid and dense, was its doom,
And Bigotry swathed it from cradle to tomb;
When the Few thought the Many mere workers for them,
To use them, and when they had used, to contemn;
And the Many, poor fools! thought the treatment their due
And crawled in the dust at the feet of the Few!
No! The Present, though clouds o'er her countenance roll
IHas a light in her eyes, and a hope in her soul;
And we are too wise like the Bigots to mourn
For the darkness of days that shall never return.
Worn out and extinct, may their history serve
As a beacon to warn us, whenever we swerve,
To shun the Oppression, the Folly and Crime,
That blacken the page of that Record of Time.
Their chivalry lightened the gloom, it is true,
And Honor and Loyalty dwelt with the Few;
But small was the light, and of little avail,
Compared with the blaze of our Press and our Rail;
Success to that blaze! May it shine over all,
Till Ignorance learn with what grace she may fall,
And fly from the world with the sorrow she wrought.
And leave it to Virtue and Freedom of Thought.

In tastes that breed their own delight.

Must all that raises man proceed!

For us shall duty make it good;

82. THEV WISE MAN'S PRAYER.-Dr. Samuel Johnson
INQUIRER, cease! petitions yet remain
Which Heaven may hear;-- nor deem religion vaine
Still raise for good the supplicating voice,
But leave to Heaven the measure and the choice
Safe in His power, whose eyes discern afar
The secret ambush of a specious pray'r;
Implore His aid, in His decisions rest,
Secure, whate'er He gives, He gives the best.
Yet, when the sense of sacred presence fires,
And strong devotion to the skies aspires,
Pour forth thy fervors for a healthful mind,
Obedient passions, and a will resigned~
For love, which scarce collective man can fill;
For patience, sovereign o'er transmuLted ill;
For faith, that, panting for a happier seat,
Counts death kind Nature's signal for retreat:
These goods for man the laws of Heaven ordain;
These goods He grants who grants the power to gwin
With these, celestial Wisdom calms the rmind,
And makes the happiness she does not find.
102PART SECOND.
MIARTIAL AND POPULAR.
1. SCIPIO TO IIIS ARMY. --Abridgment from Lzvy.
Before the oattle of Ticinus, B. C. 218, in which the Carthaginians, under Rannibal, were
victorinus. The speech of the latter, on the same occasion, follows.
NOT because of their colnage, 0 soldiers, but because an engagement
is now inevitable, do the enemy prepare fbr battle.  Two-thirds of their
infantry and cavalry have been lost in the passage of the Alps.  Those
who survive hardly equal in number those who have perished.
Should any one say, "Though few, they are stout and irresistible," I
reply,- Not so! They are the veriest shadows of men; wretch'es,
emaciated with hunger, and benumbed with cold; bruised and
enfeebled among the rocks and crags; their joints frost-bitten, their
sinews stiffened with the snow, their armor battered and shivered,
their horses lame and powerless. Such is the cavalry, such the infantry, against which you have to contend; - not enemies, but shreds
and remnants of enemies! And I fear nothing more, than that when
you have fought Hannibal, the Alps may seem to have been beforehand, and to have robbed you of the renown of a victory. But perhaps it was fitting that the Gods themselves, irrespective of human
aid, should commence and carry forward a war against a leader and a
people who violate the faith of treaties; and that we, who next to
the Gods have been most injured, should complete the contest thus
commenced, and nearly finished.
I would, therefore, have you fight, O soldiers, not only with that
spirit with which you are wont to encounter other enemies, but with a
certain indignation and resentment, such as you might experience if
you should see your slaves suddenly taking up arms against you. We
might have slain these Carthaginians, when they were shut up in
Eryx, by hunger, the most dreadful of human tortures.  We might
have carried over our victorious fleet to Africa, and, in a few days,
have destroyed Carthage, without opposition.  We yielded to their
prayurs for pardon; we released them from the blockade; we made
peace with them when conquered; anld we afterwards held them uilder
our protection, when they were borne down by the African war. It
return for these benefits, they come, under the leadership of a hotbrained youth, to lay waste our country.  Ah! would that the contest on your side were now for glory, and not for safety! It is notTHE STANDARD SPEAKER.
for the possession of Sicily and Sardinia, but for Italy, that you musl
fight: nor is there another army behind, which, should we fail to conquer, can resist the enemy: nor are there other Alps, during the
passage of which, fresh forces may be procured. Here, soldiers, here
we must make our stand. Here we must fight, as if we fought before
the walls of Rome! Let every man bear in mind, it is not only his
own person, but his wife and children, he must now defend. Nor let
the thought of them alone possess his mind.  Let him remember
that the lRoman Senate --the Roman People - are looking, with
anxious eyes, to our exertions; and that, as our valor and our strength
shall this day be, such will be the fortune of Rome--such the welare - nay, the very existence, of our country!
2. IIANNIBAL TO HIS ARMY..-Abridgment from Livy.
HERE, soldiers, you must either conquer or die.  On the right and
left two seas enclose you; and you have no ship to fly to for escape.
The river Po around you, - the Po, larger and more impetuous than
the Rhone, - the Alps behind, scarcely passed by you when fresh and
vigorous, hem you in. Here Fortune has granted you the termination of your labors; here she will bestow a reward worthy of the
service you have undergone. All the spoils that Rome has amassed
by so many triumphs will be yours. Think not that, in proportion as
this war is great in name, the victory will be difficult. From the
Pillars of Hercules, from the ocean, from the remotest limits of the
world, over mountains and rivers, you have advanced victorious
through the fiercest Nations of Gaul and Spain. And with whom
are you now to fight? With a raw army, which this very summer
was beaten, conquered, and surrounded; an army unknown to their
leader, and he to them! Shall I compare myself, almost born, and
certainly bred, in the tent of my father, that illustrious commander,myself, the conqueror, not only of the Alpine Nations, but of the
Alps themselves, - myself, who was the pupil of you all, before I
became your commander, - to this six months' general? or shall I
compare his army with mine?
On what side soever I turn my eyes, I behold all full of courace
and strength:--a veteran infantry; a most gallant cavalry; you, our
allies, most faithful and valiant; you, Carthaginians, whom not only
your country's cause, but the justest anger, impels to battle. The
valor, the confidence of invaders, are ever greater than those of the
defensive party. As the assailants in this war, we pour down, with
hostile standards, upon Italy.  We bring the war. Suffering, injury
and indignity, fire our minds. First they demanded me, your leader,
for punishment; and then all of you, who had laid siege to Saguntum.
And, had we been given up, they would have visited us with the
severest tortures.  Cruel and haughty Nation!  Everything must
be yours, and at your disposal! You are to prescribe to us with
104MARTIAL AND POPULAR. - REGULUS.
%.hom we shall nave war, with whom peace! You are to snut us up
by the bozmdaries of mountains and rivers, which we must not pass!
But you -you are not to observe the limits yourselves have appointed! "Pass not the Iberus! "--What next?  "Saguntum is on
the Iberus. You must not move a step in any direction! "- Is it a
small thing that you have deprived us of our most ancient provinces,
Sicily and Sardinia?  Will you take Spain also?  Should we yield
Spain, you will cross over into Africa.  i'Ill cross, did I say2 They
have sent the two Consuls of this year, one to Africa, the other to
Spain!
Soldiers, there is nothing left to us, in any quarter, but what we
can vindicate with our swords.  Let those be cowards who have
something to look back upon; whom, flying through safe and unmolested roads, their own country will receive. There is a necessity for
us to be brave. There is no alternative but victory or death; and, if it
must be death, who would not rather encounter it in battle than in
flight? The immortal Gods could give no stronger incentive to victory. Let but these truths be fixed in your minds, and once again I
proclaim, you are conquerors!
3. REGULUS TO TIIE ROMAN SENATE.- Original.
ILL does it become me, 0 Senators of Rome --ill does it become
Regiilus, - after having so often stood in this venerable Assembly
clothed with the supreme dignity of the Republic, to stand before
you a captive - the captive of Carthage! Though outwardly I am
free, - though no fetters encumber the limbs, or gall the flesh,-- yet
the heaviest of chains, - the pledge of a Roman Consul, - makes me
the bondsman of the Carthaginians. They have my promise to return
to them, in the event of the failure of this their embassy. My life
is at their mercy. My honor is my own; - a possession which no
reverse of fortune can jeopard; a flame which imprisonment cannot
stifle, time cannot dim, death cannot extinguish.
Of the train of disasters which followed close on the unexampled
successes of our arms, - of the bitter fate which swept off the flower
of our soldiery, and consigned me, your General, wounded and senseless, to Carthaginian keeping, - I will not speak.  For five years, a
rigorous captivity has been my portion. For five years, the society of
family and friends, the dear amenities of home, the sense of freedom,
and the sight of country, have been to me a recollection and a dream,
-- no more! But during that period Rome has retrieved her defeats.
She has recovered under Metellus what under Regilus she lost. She
has routed armies. She has taken unnumbered prisoners. She has
struck terror to the hearts of the Carthaginians; who have now sent
me Ihither. with their Ambassadors, to sue for peace, and to propose
that, in exchange for me, your former Consul, a thousand common
prisoners of war shall be given up. You have heard the Ambassa
105THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
dors, Their intimations of some unimaginable horror - I know not
vhat -- impending over myself, should I fail to induce you to accept
their terms, have strongly moved your sympathies in my behalf.
Another appeal, which I would you might have been spared, has lent
force to their suit. A wife and children, threatened with widowhood
and orphanage, weeping and despairing, have knelt at your feet, on the
very threshold of the Senate-chamber. - Conscript Fathers! Shall
not Regilus be saved?  Must he return to Carthage to meet the
cruelties which the Ambassadors brandish before our eyes?- With
one voice you answer, No! --Countrymen! Friends! For all that I
have suffered - for all that I may have to suffer - I am repaid in
the compensation of this moment! Unfortunate, you may hold me;
but, 0, not undeserving! Your confidence in my honor survives all
the ruin that adverse fortune could inflict. You have not forgotten
the past. Republics are not ungrateful! May the thanks I cannot
utter bring down blessings from the Gods on you and Rome!
Conscript Fathers! There is but one course to be pursued. AbanIon all thought of peace. Reject the overtures of Carthage! Reject
them wholly and unconditionally! What! Give back to her a
thousand able-bodied men, and receive in return this one attenuated,
war-worn, fever-wasted frame, - this weed, whitened in a dungeon's
darkness, pale and sapless, which no kindness of the sun, no
softness of the summer breeze, can ever restore to health and vigor?
It must not -it shahl not be! O! were Reguilus what he was once,
before captivity had unstrung his sinews and enervated his limbs,
he might pause,--he might proudly think he were well worth a
thousand of the foe; - he might say, " Make the exchange! Rome
shall not lose by it!"  But now--alas! now't is gone, - that
impetuosity of strength, which could once make him a leader indeed,
to penetrate a phalanx or guide a pursuit. His very armor would be
a burthen now. His battle-cry would be drowned in the din of the
onset. His sword would fall harmless on his opponent's shield. But,
if he cannot live, he can at least die, for his country! Do not deny
him this supreme consolation.  Consider: every indignity, every
torture, which Carthage shall heap on his dying hours, will be better
than a trumpet's call to your armies. They will remember only
Reguilus, their fellow-soldier and their leader. They will forget his
defeats. They will regard only his services to the Republic. Tunis,
Sardinia, Sicily, - every well-fought field, won by his blood and
theirs, - will flash on their remembrance, and kindle their avenging

befor: against the foe.

i LEONIDAS TO HIS THREE HUNDRED. - Original Translationfrom Pichat.
YE men of Sparta, listen to the hope with which the Gods inspire
LeSnidas! Consider how largely our death may redound to the glory
and benefit of our country. Against this barbarian King, who, in his
battle array, reckons as many nations as our ranks do soldiers, what
could united Greece effect?  In this emergency there is need that
some unexpected power should interpose itself; --that a valor and
devotion, unknown hitherto, even to Sparta, should strike, amaze,
confound, this ambitious Despot! From our blood, here freely shed
to-day, shall this moral power, this sublime lesson of patriotism, pro.
ceed. To Greece it shall teach the secret of her strength; to the
Persians, the certainty of their weakness. Before our scarred and
bleeding bodies, we shall see the great King grow pale at his own
victory, and recoil affrighted. Or, should he succeed in forcing the
pass of Therm6pylae, he will tremble to learn, that, in marching upoD
our cities, he will find ten thousand, after us, equally prepared for
death. Ten thousand, do I say? 0, the swift contagion of a generous
enthusiasm! Our example shall make G-reece all fertile in heroes.
An avenging cry shall follow the cry of her affliction. Country  
Independence! From the Messenian hills to the Hellespont, every
heart shall respond; and a hundred thousand heroes, with oTle sacred
accord, shall arm themselves, in emulation of our unanimous death.
These rocks shall give back the echo of their oaths. Then shall our
little band, - the brave three hundred, - from the world of shades,
revisit the scene; behold the haughty Xerxes, a fugitive, re-cross the
Hellespont in a frail bark; while Greece, after eclipsing the most
glorious of her exploits, shall hallow a new Olympus in the mound
that covers our tomnbs.
Yes, fellow-soldiers, history and posterity shall consecrate our ashes.
WVherever courage is honored, through all time, shall Therm6pylve and
the Spartan three hundred be rememlbered.  Ours shall be an immortality such as no human glory has yet attained.  And when ages shall
have swept by, and Sparta's last hour shall have come, then, even
in her ruins, shall she be eloquent. Tyrants shall turn away froin
them, appalled; but the heroes of liberty - the poets, the sages, the
historians of all time - shall invoke and bless the memory of the
gallant three hundred of Le5nldas!
5. BRUTUS OVER TIIE DEAD LUCRETIA. - Original and Comnpzea.
You are amazed, O Romans! even amid the general horror at
Lucretia's death; that Brutus, whom you have known hitherto only as
the fool, should all at once assume the language and bearing of a man!
Did not the Sibyl say, a fool should set Rome free? I am that fool!
Brutus bids Rome be free! If he has played the fool, it was to seize
the wise man's opportunity. Here he throws off the mask of madness.
XT ie Lucius Junius now, your countryman, who calls upon you, by
this innocent blood, to swear eternal vengeance against kings!CONTENTS.

Look, Romais! turn your eyes on this sad spectacle!-the
daughter of Lucretius, Collatinus' wife! By her own hand she died!
See there a neuie lady, whom the ruffian lust of a Tarquin reduced to
the necessity of being her own executioner, to attest her innocence:
Hospitably entertained by her as her husband's kinsman, Sextus, the
perfidious guest, became her brutal ravisher. The chaste, the generous
Lucretia, could not survive the outrage. Heroic matron! But ontr:
rnly treated as a slave, life was no longer endurable! And if?he,
with her soft woman's nature, disdained a life, that depended on a
tyrant's will, shall we-shall men, with such an example before
their eyes, and after five-and-twenty years of ignominious servitude
--shall we, through a fear of death, delay one moment to assert our
freedom? No, Romals! The favorable moment is come. The time
is ---now! Fear not that the army will take the part of their Generals, rather than of the People. The love of liberty is natural to all;
and your fellow-citizens in the Camp feel the weight of oppression as
sensibly as you. Doubt not they will as eagerly seize the opportunity
of throwing off their yoke.
Courage, Romans! The Gods are for us! those Gods whose temples and altars the impious Tarquin has profaned. By the blood of
the wronged Lucretia, I swear, - hear me, ye Powers Supreme! - by
this blood, which was once so pure, and which nothing but royal villany
could have polluted, - I swear that I will pursue, to the death, these
Tarquins, with fire and sword; nor will I ever suffer any one of that
family, or of any other family whatsoever, to be King in Rome! -
On to the Forum! Bear the body hence, high in the public view,
through all the streets! On, Romans, on! The fool shall set you
free!
8 REPLY OF ACHILLES TO THE ENVOYS OF AGAMEMNON, SOLICITING A REO
ONCILIATION. - Cowper's Homer.
I MUST with plainness speak my fixed resolve;
For I abhor the man, - not more the gates
Of hell itself! -whose words belie his heart.
So shall not mine! My judgment undisguised
Is this: that neither Agamemnon me
Nor all the Greeks shall move! For ceaseless toil
Winls heie no thanks; one recompense awaits
The sedentary and the most alert!
The brave and base in equal honor stand, -
And drones and heroes fall unwept alike'
I, after all my labors, who exposed
My life continual in the field, have earned
No very sumptuous prize! As the poor bird
Gives to her unfledged brood a morsel gained
After long search, though wanting it herself,
So I have worn out many sleepless nights,
And waded deep through many a bloody dayMARTIAL AND POPULAR. -- HOMEnr
In battle for their wives. I have destroyed
Twelve cities with my fleet; and twelve, save one
On foot contending, in the fields of Troy.
From all these cities precious spoil I took
Abundant, and to Agamemnon's hand
Gave all the treasure. He within his ships
Abode the while, and, having all received,
Little distributed, and much retained.
He gave, however, to the Kings and Chiefs
A portion, and they keep it. Me alone,
Of all the Grecian host, hath he despoiled!
3My bride, my soul's delight, is in his hands!
Tell him my reply:
And tell it him aloud, that other Greeks
May indignation feel like me, if, armed
Always in impudence, he seek to wrong
Them also. Let him not henceforth presume--
Canine and hard in aspect though he be -
To look me in the face. I will not share
His counsels, neither will I aid his works.
Let it suffice him, that he wronged me once, -
Deceived me once; --henceforth his glozing arts
Are lost on me! But, let him rot in peace,
Crazed as he is, and, by the stroke of Jove,
Infatuate! I detest his gifts! - and him
So honor as the thing which most I scorn!
And would he give me twenty times the worth
Of this his offer, - all the treasured heaps
Which he possesses, or shall yet possess,
All that Orch6m6nos within her walls,
And all that opulent Egyptian Thebes
Receives, - the city with a hundred gates,
Whence twenty thousand chariots rush to war,--
And would he give me riches as the sands,
And as the dust of earth, - no gifts from him
Should soothe me, till my soul were first avenged
For all the offensive license of his tongue.
I will not wed the daughter of your Chief, -
Of Agamemnon. Could she vie in charms
With golden Venus,- had she all the skill
Of blue-eyed Pallas, - even so endowed,
She were no bride for me!
Bear ye mine answer back.
JIECTOR'S REBUKE TO POLYDAMAS. -Cowper's Homer. Abrztged
POLYDIAMAS to dauntless Hector spake:
OAttimes in council, Hector, thou art wontTHE STANDARD IEAKER.
To censure me, although advising well'
Yet hear my best opinion once again.
Proceed we not in our attempt against
The Grecian fleet. The omens we have seen
All urge against it.  When the eagle flew,
Clutching the spotted snake, then dropping it
Into the open space between the hosts,
Troy's host was on the left. Was this propitioua
No. Many a Trojan shall we leave behind,
Slain by the Grecians in their fleet's defence.
An augur skilled in omens would expound
This omen thus, and faith would win from all.
To whom dark-louring Hector thus replied:
Polydamas! I like not thy advice;
Thou couldst have framed far better; but if this
Be thy deliberate judgment, then the Gods
MIake thy deliberate judgment nothing worth,
Who bidd'st me disregard the Thunderer's firm
Assurance to myself announced, and make
The wild inhabitants of air my guides,
Which I alike despise, speed they their course
With right-hand flight toward the ruddy East,
Or leftward down into the shades of eve!
Consider we the will of Jove alone,
Sovereign of Heaven and Earth.  Omens abound;
But the best omen is our country's cause.*
Wherefore should fiery war thy soul alarm?
For were we slaughtered, one and all, around
The fleet of Greece, thou need'st not fear to die,
IThose courage never will thy flight retard.
But if thou shrink thyself, or by smooth speech
Seduce one other from a soldier's part,
Pierced by this spear incontinent thou diest!. HECTOR'S EXPLOIT AT THE BARRIERS OF THE GRECIAN FLE2ET. - Idem
So hung the war in balance,Till Jove himself, superior fame, at length,
To Priamiian Hector gave, who sprang
First through the wall. In loiy sounds that reached
Their utmost ranks, he called on all his host:
Now press them! now, ye Trojans, steed-renowned,
Rush on! break through the Grecian rampart! hurl
At once devouring flames into the fleet!
Such was his exhortation. They, his vwice

patr)ts of slcceeding times.
lloMARTIAL AND POPULAR. -- HOMER.
All hearing, with close-ordered ranks, direct
Bore on the barrier, and up-swarming showed
On the high battlement their glittering spears.
But Hector seized a stone; of ample base,
But tapering to a point; before the gate
It stood. No two men, mightiest of a lanid
(Such men as now are mighty), could with ease
Have heaved it from the earth up to a wain;
He swung it easily alone, - so light
The son of Saturn made it in his hand.
As in one hand with ease the shepherd bears
A ram's fleece home, nor toils beneath the weight.
So Hector, right toward the planks of those
3Majestic folding-gates, close-jointed, firm
And solid, bore the stone. Two bars within
Their corresponding force combined transverse
To guard them, and one bolt secured the bars.
Hie stood fast by them, parting wide his feet
For'vantage sake, and smote them in the midst.
He burst both hinges; inward fell the rock
Ponderous, and the portals roared; the bars
Endured not, and the planks, riven by the force
Of that huge mass, flew scattered on all sides.
In leaped the godlike Hero at the breach,
Gloomy as night in aspect, but in arms
All-dazzling, and he grasped two quivering spearm
IIim entering with a leap the gates, no force
Whate'er of opposition had repressed,
Save of the Gods alone. Fire filled his eyes;
Turning, he bade the multitude without
Ascend the rampart; they his voice obeyed;
Part climbed the wall, part poured into the gate;
The Grecians to their hollow galleys flew,
Scattered; and tumult infinite arose.
9. HECTOR SLAIN BY ACHILLES.-C-owper's.Homer.
BRIGHT as among the stars the star of all,
MIost radiant Hesperus, at midnight moves,
So in the right hand of Achilles beamed
I-Iis brandished spear, while, meditating woe
To Hector, he explored his noble form,
Seeking where he was vulnerable most.
But every part, his dazzling armor, torn
From brave Patr5clus' body, well secured,
Save where the circling key-bone from  the neck
Disjoins the shoulder there his throat appeared
IlITHE STANDARD SPEArER.
Whence injured life with swiftest flight escapes.
Achilles, plunging in that part his spear,
Impelled it through the yielding flesh beyond.
The ashen beam his power of utterance left
Still unimpaired, but in the dust he fell,
And the exulting conqueror exclaimed:
But Hector: thou had'st once far other hopes,
And, stripping slain Patr6clus, thought'st thee safe,
Nor cared'st for absent me. Fond dream and vain!
I was not distant far. In yonder fleet
1-ie left one able to avenge his death,
And he hath slain thee. Tlee the dogs shall rend
Dishonorably, and the fowls of air,But all Achaia's host shall him entomb!
To whom the Trojan Chief languid replied:
By thy own life - by theirs who gave thee birth -
And by thy knees -O! let not Grecian dogs
Rend and devour me; but in gold accept
And brass a ransom at my father's hands,
And at my mother's an illustrious price.
Send home my body! - grant me burial rites
Among the daughters and the sons of Troy!
To whom, with aspect stern, Achilles thus:
Dog! neither knees nor parents name to me!
I would my fierceness of revenge were such
That I could carve and eat thee, to whose arms
Such griefs I owe; so true it is and sure
That none shall save thy carcass from the dogs!
No, trust me, would thy parents bring me, weighed.
Ten - twenty - ransoms, and engage, on oath,
To add still more;- would thy Dardanian Sire,
Priam, redeem thee with thy weight in gold, -
Not even at that price would I consent
That she who bare should place thee on thy bier.
With lamentation! Dogs and ravening fowls
Shall rend thy body, while a shred remains!
Then, dying, warlike Hector thus replied
Full well I knew before how suit of mine
Should speed, preferred to thee. Thy heart is steel
But, O! while yet thou liv'st, think, lest the Gods
Requite thee on that day, when, pierced thyself,
By Paris and Apollo, thou shalt fall,
Brave as thou art, before the Scman gate!

Original Abridgment.
FELLOW-SOLDIERS and confederated chiefs! I grant you, if ever
man deserved to have the weapon of stratagem and deceit turned
against him, it is he who has used it himself so often, - the faithless Adrastus! But shall it be said that we, who have united to punish the perfidy of this man,--that we are ourselves perfidious'
Shall fraud be counteracted by fraud? If we can adopt the practices
of Adrastus without guilt, Adrastus himself is innocent, and our
present attempt to punish him is unwarrantable.  You have sworn,
by all that is most sacred, to leave Venusium a deposit in the hands
of the Lucanians. The Lucanian garrison, you say, is corrupted by
Adrastus.  I do not doubt it. But this garrison is still Lucanian.
It receives the pay of the Lucanians, and has not yet refused to obey
them.   It has preserved, at least, an appearance of neutrality.
Neither Adrastus nor his people have yet entered it. The treaty is
still subsisting; and the Gods have not forgotten your oath.
Is a promise never to be kept but when a plausible pretence to
break it is wanting? Shall an oath be sacred onily when notlhing is
to be gained by its violation?  If you are insensible to the love of
virtue, and the fear of the Gods, have you no regard to your interest
and reputation? If, to terminate a war, you violate your oath, how
many wars will this impious conduct excite? Who will hereafter
trust you? What security can you ever give for your good faith?
A solemn treaty? - You have trampled one under foot! An oath? --
You have committed perjury when perjury was profitable, and have
defied the Gods! In peace, you will be regarded as treacherously
preparing for war. Every affair, based on a confidence in your
probity, will become impracticable.  Your promises will not be
believed. Nay, the very league which now constitutes your strength
will lose its cohesive principle. Your perjury will be the triumph of
Adrastus! He will not need to attack you himself. Your own
disensions, your own mistrusts, your own duplicity, will be your ruin.
Ye mighty chiefs, renowned for magnanimity and wisdom, expetieneed and brave, governing uncounted thousands, - despise not the
cunsel of a youth! To whatever extremity war may reduce you, let
your resources be diligence and virtue. True fortitude can never
despair. But, if you once pass the barrier 6f honor and integrity,
the ruin of your cause is irreparable. You can neither redstablish
that confidence without which no affair of importance can succeed,
nor can you bring men back to the reverence of that virtue which you
have taught them to despise. What have you to fear?  Is not your
courage equal t" victory, without the aid of fraud? Youtr own power

have sealed his ruin!
11. TITUS QUINTIUS AGAINST QUARRELS BETWEEN TILE SENATE AND IHB
PEOPLE. - Abridgment from Livy.
TiOUaH I am conscious of no fault, 0 Romans, it is yet with the
utmost shame I have come forward to your Assembly. You have
seen it-- posterity will know it - that, in my fourth consulate, the
AEquans and Volseians came in arms to the very gates of Rome, and
went away unchastised! IHad I foreseen that such an ignominy had
been reserved for my official year, - that Rtome might have been taken
while I was Consul, - I would have shunned the office, either by exile
or by death. Yes; I have had hraoors enough,- of liie more than
enough! I should have died in my third consulate.  Whom did these
most dastardly enemies despise? - us, Consuls, or you, citizens? If
we are in fault, depose us, - punish us as we deserve. If you, Romans,
are to blame, may neither Gods nor men make you suffer for your
offences!-only may you repent. No, Romans, the confidence of our
enemies is not from a belief in their own courage, or in your cowardice.
They have been too often vanquished, not to know both themselves
and you. Discord, discord amongst ourselves, is the ruin of this city.
The eternal disputes between the Senate and the People are the sole
cause of our misfortunes.
In the name of Heaven, what is it, Romans, you would have? You
desired Tribunes of the commons. For the sake of concord, we
granted Tribunes. You were eager to have Decemvirs. We suffered
them to be created.  You grew weary of Decemvirs.  WVe compelled
them to abdicate. You insisted on the restoration of the Tribuneship.
We yielded. You invaded our rights. We have borne, and still
bear. What termination is there to be to these dissensions?.VWhen
shall we have a united city?  When one common country?  With
the enemy at our gates,--with the Volscian foe scaling your rampart, - there is no one to hinder it.  But against us you are valiant,
--against us you cliligently take up arms! Come on, then. Besiege
the Senate-house. Make a camp of the Forum. Fill the jails with
our chlief nobles. Then sally out with the same determined spirit
against the enemy. Does your resolution fail? Look, then, to see
your lands ravaged, your houses plundered and in flames, the whole
country laid waste with fire and sword.
Extinguish, 0 Romans, these fatal divisions! Break the spell of
this enchantment, which renders you powerless and inactive I If you

12 CAIUS MARIUS TO THE RO0IANS, ON THE OBJECTIONS TO MAKING IIM
GENERAL. - Original Paraphrase from Sallust
You have committed to my conduct, O Romans, the war againlst
Jugurtha.  The Patricians are offended at this.  " He has no family
statues," they exclaim.  "' He can point to no illustrious line cf ancestors!"  What then?.Will dead ancestors will motionless -statues, help fight your battles?  Will it avail your General to appeal to
these, in the perilous hour?  Rare wisdom would it be, my countrylmen, to intrust the command of your army. to one whose only qualification for it would be' the virtue of his forefathers! to one untried
and unexperienced, but of most unexceptionable family! who could not
show a solitary scar, but any number of ancestral statues! who knew
not the first rudiments of war, but was very perfect in pedigrees!
fruly I have known of such holiday heroes,- raised, because of family
considerations, to a command for which they were not fitted, - who,
when the moment for action arrived, were obliged, in their ignorance
and trepidation, to give to some inferior officer--to some despised
Plebeian --the ordering of every movement.
I submit it to you, Romans,-is Patrician pride or Plebeian experience
the safer reliance?  The actions of which my opponents have merely
read, I have achieved or shared in. What they have seen written in
books, I have seen written on battle-fields with steel and blood. They
object to my humble birth. They sneer at my lowly origin. Impotent objection! Ignominious sneer! Where but in thle spirit of a man
(bear witness, Gods!), -where but in the spirit, can his nobility be
lodged? and where his dishonor, but in his own cowardly inaction, or
his unworthy deeds? Tell these railers at my obscure extraction, their
haughty lineage could not make them noble - my hulrble birth could
never make me base.
I profess no indifference to noble descent. It is a good thing to
number great men among one's ancestry.  But when a descendant is
dwarfed in the comparison, it should be accounted a shame rather than
a boast. These Patricians cannot despise me, if they would, since their
titles of nobility date from ancestral services sinmilar to those which I
myself have rendered.  And what if I can show no family statues?
I can show the standards, the armor, and the spoils, which I myself
have wrested from the vanquislhed.  I can show the scars of many

13. CAII'S GRACCHUS CITED BEFORE THE CENSORS, APPEALS TO THU
PEOPLE. - Original Adaptation from J. S. Knowles.
It appears
I am cited here because I have returned
Without my General's leave, and for the crime
Of having raised the tumult at Fregella.
First, with the first. I have remained my time;
Nay, I have over-served it by the laws, -
The laws which Caius Gracchus dares not break.
]But, Censors, let that pass. I will propose
A better question for your satisfaction: -
"How have I served my time?"  I'11 answer that:" How have I served my time? For mine own gain,
Or that of the Republic? "  What was my office?
Questor. What was its nature? Lucrative,So lucrative, that all my predecessors
Who went forth poor returned home very rich.
I went forth poor enough,
But have returned still poorer than I went.
Ye citizens of Rome, behold what favor
Your mlasters show your brethren! I have borne
My country's arms with honor; over-served
My time; returned in poverty, that might
Iave amassed treasures,- and they thus reward me:Prefer a charge against me without proof,
Direct or indirect; without a testimony,
Weighty or light; without an argument,
Idle or plausible; without as much
Of feasibility as would suffice
To feed suspicion's phantom! Why is this?
How have I bought this hatred? When my brother,
Tiberius Gracchus, fell beneath their blows,
I called them not assassins! When his friends
Fell sacrifices to their after-vengeance,
I did not style them butchers! - did not name them
The proud, perfidious, insolent Patricians!
Ye men of Rome, thlere is no favor, now,
For justice! Grudgingly her dues are granted!
Your great men boast no more the love of counitry.
They count their talents; measure their domains;
Enlarge their palaces; dress forth their banquets;
Awake their lyres and timbrels; and with their floo&amp;d
Of ripe Falernian drown the little left
Of virtue! - Roimans, I would be your Tribune.
Fear not, Censors! I would raise no tumiult;
This hand's the first to arm against the maur.
Whoe'er he be, that favors civil discord
116MARTIAL AND POPULAR. -T-ACITUS.
I have no gust for blood, nor for oppression!
I sacrifice to Justice and to Mercy!
The laws! the laws! Of common right the guard,The wealth, the happiness, the fireedom of
The Nation! Who has hidden them, defaced them,
Sold them, corrupted themi from the pure letter?
Why do they guard the rich man's cloak from a rent,
And tear the poor man's garment from his back?
Whly are they, in the proud man's grasp, a sword,
And in the hand of the humnble man, a reed?
The laws! The laws! I ask you for the laws
Demand them in my c'ountry's sacred name!
Still silent?  Reckless still of my appeal?
Romans! I ask the office of your Tribune!
14. GALGACUS TO TIHE CALEDONIANS. - Original Abrzdgment.from Tachtus
REFLECTING on the origin of this war, and on the straits to which
we are reduced, I am persuaded, 0 Caledonians, that to your strong
hands and indomitable will is British liberty this day confided. There
is no retreat for us, if vanquished.  Not even the sea, covered as it is,by the Roman fleet, offers a path for escape. And thus war and arms,
ever welcomed by the brave, are now the only safety of the cowardly,
if any such there be. No refuge is behind us; naught but the rocks,
and the waves, and the deadlier Romans: men whose pride you have
vaiinly tried to conciliate by forbearance; whose cruelty you have
vainly sought to deprecate by moderation. The robbers of the globe,
when the land fails, they scour the sea. Is the enemy rich, -they are
avaricious; is he poor, -they are ambitious. The East and the West
are unable to satiate their desires.  Wealth and poverty are alike
coveted by their rapacity.  To carry off, to massacre, to make seizures under false pretences, this they call empire; and when they make
a desert, they call it peace!
Do not suppose, however, that the prowess of these PRomans is equal
to their lust. They have thrived on our divisions. They know how
to turn the vices of others to their own profit.  Casting off all hope
of pardon, let us exhibit the courage of men to whom salvation and
glory are equally dear. Nursed in freedom as we have been, unconquered and unconquerable, let us, in the first onset, show these usurp~rs what manner of men they are that Old Caledonia shelters in her
bosom!   All the incitements to victory are on our side. Wives,
parents, children, - these we have to protect; and these the Romans
have not. They have none to cry shame upon their flight; none to
shed tears of exultation at their success.  Few in nunlbers, fearful
from ignorance, gazing on unknown forests and untried seas, the Gods
have delivered them, hemmed in, bound and helpless, into our hands.
Let not their showy aspect, their glitter of silver and gold, dismay
you. Such adornments can neither harm nor protect from harm. I

15. ICILIUS ON VIRGINIA'S SEIZURE.- T. B. Mfacaulay.
Now by your children's cradles, - now, by your fathers' graves,
Be men to-day, Quirites, or be forever slaves!
For this did Servius give us laws?  For this did Lucrece bleed?
For this was the great vengeance wrought on Tarquin's evil seed?
For this did those false sons make red the axes of their sire?
Ffor this did Scmv6la's right hand hiss in the Tuscan fire?
Shall the vile earth-fox awe the race that stormed the lion's den?
Shall we, who could not brook one lord, crouch to the wicked Ten 2
O for that ancient spirit which curbed the Senate's will!
O for the tents which in old time whitened the Sacred Hill!
In those brave days our fathers stood firmly, side by side;
They faced the Marcian fury; they tamed the Fabian pride;
They drove the fiercest Quinctius an outcast forth from Rome'
They sent the haughtiest Claudius with shivered fasces home.
But what their care bequeathed us, our madness flung away:
All the ripe fruit of threescore years was blighted in a day.
Exult, ye proud Patricians! The hard-fought fight is o'er.
We strove for honors, -'t was in vain: for freedom, --'t is no more.
No crier to the polling summons the eager throng;
No Tribune breathes the word of might, that guards the weak fiom
wrong.
Our very hearts, that were so high, sink down beneath your will.
Riches, and lands, and power, and state--ye have them: - keep
them still.
Still keep the holy fillets; still keep the purple gown,
The axes and the curule chair, the car, and laurel crown
Still press us for your cohorts, and, when the fight is done,
Still fill'your garners from the soil which our good swords have won.
But, by the Shades beneath us, and by the Gods above,
Add not unto your cruel hate your yet more cruel love!
Have ye not gracefll ladies, whose spotless lineage springs
From Consuls, and High Pontiffs, and ancient Alban kings?
Then leave the poor Plebeian his single tie to lifeThe sweet, sweet love of daughter, of sister, and of wife;
The gentle speech, the balm for all that his vexed soul endures,
The kiss, in which he half forgets even such a yoke as yours.
Still let the maiden's beauty swell the father's breast with pride
Still let the bridegroom's arms enfold an unpolluted bride'

16. THE SPARTANS' MARCH.--Felicia Hemans. Born, 1794; died, 1835.
The Spartans used not the trumpet in their march into battle, says Thucydides, because they
wished not to excite the rage of their warriors. Their charging-step was made to the Dorian
mood of.flutes and soft recorders.
wT WAs morn upon the Grecian hills, where peasants dressed the vines;
Sunlight was on Cithberon's rills, Arcadia's rocks and pines.
And brightly, through his reeds and flowers, Eur5tas wandered by,
When a sound arose from Sparta's towers of solemn harmony.
VWas it the hunter's choral strain, to the woodland-godd6ss poured?
Did virgin hands, in Pallas' fane, strike the full-sounding chord?
But helms were glancing on the stream, spears ranged in close array,
And shields flung back a glorious beam to the morn of a fearful day!
And the mountain echoes of the land swelled through the deep-blue sky
While to soft strains moved forth a band of men that moved to die.
They marched not with the trumpet's blast, nor bade the horn peal out;
And the, laurel-groves, as on they passed, rung with no battle shout!
They asked no clarion's voice to fire their souls with an impulse high
But the Dorian reed, and the Spartan lyre, for the sons of liberty!
And still sweet flutes, their path around, sent forth AEolian breath:
They needed not a sterner sound to marshal thein for death!
So moved they calmly to their field, thence never to return,
Save bringing back the Spartan shield, or on it proudly borne!
17. THE GREEKS' RETURN FROM BATTLE.--Ibid.
Io! they come, they come! garlands for every shrine!
Strike lyres to greet them home! bring roses, pour ye wine!
Swell, swell the Dorian flute, through the blue, triumphant sky!
Let the Cittern's tone salute the sons of victory.
With the offerings of bright blood, they have ransomed hearth and tomb,
Vineyard, and field, and flood;- Io! they come, they come
Sing it where olives wave, and by the glittering sea,
And o'er each hero's grave, - sing, sing, the land is free!
Mark ye the flashing oars, and the spears that light the deep!
HIow the festal sunshine pours, where the lords of battle swcep  
Each hath brought back his shield; - maid, greet thy lover home!
Mother, from that proud field,-Io! thy son is come!
Who murmured of the dead?     Hush, boding voice! We know
That many a shining head lies in its glory low.
Breathe not those names to-day! They shall have their praise ere lon,
And a power all hearts to sway, in ever-burning song.

1S. ODE. - lWTilliam Collins. Born, 1720; dzed, 17M6.
How sleep the brave, who sink to rest,
By all their country's wishes blest!
When Spring, with dewy fingers cold,
Returns to deck their hallowed mould,
She there shall dress a sweeter sod
Than Fancy's feet have ever trod.
By fairy hands their knell is rung;
-By forms unseen their dirge is sung;
There Honor comes, a pilgrim gray,
To bless the turf that wraps their clay;
And Freedom shall a while repair,
To dwell, a weeping hermit, there.
19. VIRGINIUJS, AS TRIBUNE, REFUSES THE APPEAL OF APPIUS CLAJ"DIUS.
- Original Paraphrase from Livy.
I AFFIRM, 0 Romans, that Appius Claudius is the only man not
entitled to a participation in the laws, nor to the comnmon privileges of
civil or human society. The tribunal over which, as perpetual Dece-mvir,
he presided, was made the fortress of all villanies.  A despiser of Gods
and men, he vented his fury on the properties and persons of citizens,
threatening all with his rods and axes. Executioners, not Lictors,
were his attendants.  His passions roaming from rapine to murder,
from murder to lust, he tore a free-born maiden, as if she were a
prisoner of war, from the embraces of me, her father, before the
eyes of the Roman People, and gave her to his creature, the purveyor
of his secret pleasures! Ye heard, my countrymen, the cruel decree,
the infamnous decision.  Ye beheld the right hand of the father armed
against his daugoliter. Armed against, do I say?  No, by the G-ods'
armed in her bels lrf,--since it was to rescue her, by death, from clishonor, that I sheathed in her innocent bosom the knife! Ye heard
the tyrant, when the uncle and the betrothed husband of Virginia
raised her lifeless body, order them to be taken off to prison. Yes,
Ronians, even at that tragical moment, the miscreant Claudius was
rfmore moved by the disappointment of his gross sensual appetite than
by the untimely death of the unoffendincg victim!
And Appius Claudius now appeals!    You hear his words. "1
appeal! "  This man, who, so recently, as Decemvir, would have consigned a free-born maiden to bonds and to dishonor, utters that sacred
expression that safeguard of Roman liberty, -" I appeal! " W'ell may
ye stand awe-struck and silent, O my countrymen! Ye see, at
length, that there are Gods who overlook human affairs; that there is
such a thillg as RETRIBUTION! Ye see that punishment must sooner
120lMARTIAL AND POPULAR. - LlVY1
r later overtake all tyranny and injustice. The man who abclished
the right of appeal now appeals! The man who trampled on the
rights of the People now implores the protection of the People!
And, finally, the man who used to call the prison the fitting domicile of
the Roman commons shall now find that it was built for him also.
Wherefore, Appius Claudius, though thou shouldst appeal, again and
again, to me, the Tribune of the People, I will as often refer thee to
a Judge, on the charge of having sentenced a free person to slavery.
And since thou wilt not go before a Judge, well knowing that justice
will condemn thee to death, I hereby order thee to be taken hence to
prison, as one condemned.
20. CANULEIUS AGAINST PATRICIAN ARROGANCE
Original Paraphrase from Livy.
Tiiis is not the first time, O Romans, that Patrician arrogance has
denied to us the rights of a common humanity. Wlhat do we now
demand? First, the right of intermarriage; and then, that the People
may confer honors on whom they please. And why, in the name of
Roman manhood, my countrymen, - why should these poor boons be
refused? Why, for claiming them, was I near being assaulted, just
now, in the senate-house? Will the city no longer stand, - will the
empire be dissolved,--because we claim that Plebeians shall no longer
be excluded from the Consulship? Truly these Patricians will, by
and by, begrudge us a participation in the light of day; they will be
indignant that we breathe the same air; that we share with them the
faculty of speech; that we wear the forms of human beings! But I
cry them mercy. They tell us it is contrary to religion that a Plebeian should be made Consul! The ancient religion of Rome forbids
it! Ah! verily? How will they reconcile this pretence to the facts?
Though not admitted to the archives, nor'to the commentaries ot the
Pontiffs, there are some notorious facts, which, in common with the
rest of the world, we well know. We know that there were Kings
before there were Consuls in Rome.  We know that Consuls possess
no prerogative, no dignity, not formerly inherent in Kings. We know
that Numa Pomnpilius was made King at Rome, who was not only
not a Patrician, but not even a citizen; that Lucius Tarquinius, who
was not even of Italian extraction, was made King; that Servius
Tullius, who was the son of a captive woman by an unknown father.
was made King.   And shall Plebeians, who formerly were not excluded fiom the Throne, now, on the juggling plea of religious objection, be debarred fiom the Consulship?
B-at it is not enc ugh that the offices of the State are withheld from
us. To keep pure their dainty blood, these Patricians would prevent,
by law, all intermarriage of members of their order with Plebeians
Could there be a more marked indignity, a more humiliating insult,
than this? Why inot legislate against our living in the same neigh

worhood, dwelling under the same skies, walking the same earth  
Ignominy not to be endured! Was it for this we expelled Kings?
WVas it for this that we exchanged one master for many      No!
Let the rights we claim be admitted, or let the Patricians fight the
battles of the State themselves. Let the public offices be open to
all; let every invidious law in regard to marriage be abolished; or,
by the Gods of our fathers, let there be no levy of troops to achieve
victories, in the benefits of which the People shall not most amply
and equally partake!
21. CATILINE TO IIIS ARMY, NEAR FAiSULA. -Ben Jonson. Born, 1574; died, 1637.
A paraphrase of the celebrated speech which Sallust attributes to Catiline, previous to the
erlngagement which ended in the rout of his army, and his own death.
I NEVER yet knew, Soldiers, that in fight
WVords added virtue unto valiant men;
Or that a General's oration made
An army fall or stand: but how much prowess,
1Habitual or natural, each man's breast
Was owner of, so much in act it showed.
Whom neither glory nor danger can excite,'T is vain to attempt with speech.
Two armies wait us, Soldiers; one from Rome
The other froer the provinces of Gaul.
The sword must now direct and cut our passage.
I only, therefore, wish you, when you strike,
To have your valors and your souls about you;
And think you carry in your laboring hands
The things you seek,- glory and liberty!
For by your swords the Fates must be instructed!
If we can give the blow, all will be safe;
We shall not want provision, nor supplies;
The colonies and free towns will lie open;
Where, if we yield to fear, expect no place,
Nor friend, to shelter those whom their own fortune
And ill-used arms have left without protection.
You might have lived in servitude or exile,
Or safe at Rome, depending on the great,
But that you thought those things unfit for men;
And, in that thought, my friends, you then were valiant,
F)r no man ever yet changed peace for war
But he that meant to conquer. Hold that purpose.
Meet the opposing army in that spirit.
There's more necessity you should be such,
In fighting for yourselves, than they for others.
He's base who trusts his feet, whose hands are armed.
Methinks I see Death and the Furies waiting
What we will do, and all the Heaven at leisureMARTIAL AND POPULAR.
For the great -pectacle. Draw, then, your swords,
And, should our destiny begrudge our virtue
The honor of the day, let us take care
To sell ourselves at such a price as may
Undo the world to buy us!
22. SPARTACUS TO THE GLADIATORS AT CAPUA - E. Kellogg.
IT had been a day of triumph in Capiia. Lentilus, returning vith
victorious eagles, had amused the populace with the sports of the
amphitheatre to an extent hitherto unknown even in that luxurious
city. The shouts of revelry had died away; the roar of the lion had
ceased; the last loiterer had retired from the banquet; and the lights
in the palace of the victor were extinguished. The moon, piercing the
tissue of fleecy clouds, silvered the dew-drops-on the corslet of the
Roman sentinel, and tipped the dark waters of the Vulturnus with a
wavy, tremulous light. No sound was heard, save the last sob of some
retiring wave, telling its story to the smooth pebbles of the beach'
and then all was still as the breast when the spirit has departed. In
the deep recesses of the amphitheatre, a band of gladiators were assembled; their muscles still knotted with the agony of conflict, the foam
upon their lips, the scowl of battle yet lingering on their brows; when
SpartAcus, starting forth fromn amid the throng, thus addressed them:
Ye cale i inme chief; and ye do -well to call him  chief who, for
twelve long years, has met upon the arena every shape of man or
beast the broad empire of Rome could furnish, and who never yet
lowered his arm. If there be one among you who can say, that ever,
in public fight or private brawl, my actions did belie my tongue, let
him stand forth, and say it. If there be three in all your company
dare face me on the bloody sands, let them come on. And yet I was
not always'thus, - a hired butcher, a savage chief of still more savage men! My ancestors came from old Sparta, and settled among
the vine-clad rocks and citron groves of Syrasella. My early life ran
quiet as the brooks by which I sported; and when,'at noon, I gathered the sheep beneath the shade, and played upon the shepherd's
flute, there was a friend, the son of a neighbor, to join me in the
pastime. We led our flocks to the same pasture, and partook together
our rustic meal. One evening, after the sheep were folded, and we
were all seated beneath the myrtle which shaded our cottage, my
grandsire, an old man, was telling of Marathon, and Leuctra; and
how, in ancient times, a little' band of Spartans, in a defile of the
mcuntains, had withstood a whole army. ~. I did not then know what
var- was; but' my cheeks burned, I'kifew not why, and I clasped the
knees of that venerable man, until my mother, parting the hair from
off my forehead, kissed my throbbing temples, and bade me go to rest,
and think no more of those old tales and savage wars. That very
night, the Romans landed on our coast. I saw the breast that had
nourished me trampled by the hoof of the war-horse; the bleeding
body of myv father flung ami,lst the blazing rafters of our (Iwelling!

" To-day I killed a man in the arena; and, when I broke his hel
met-clasps, behold! he was my friend. He knew me, smiled faintly,
gasped, and died; - the same sweet smile upon his lips that I had
marked, when, in adventurous boyhood, we scaled the lofty cliff to
pluck the first ripe grapes, and bear them hlome in childish tritmnlph.
I told the prmator that the dead man had been my friend, generous anld
brave; and I begged that I might bear away the body, to burn it

tals, and the rabble, shouted in derision, deeming it rare sport, forsooth,
to see Rome's fiercest gladiator turn pale and tlremble at sight of that
piece of bleeding clay! And the pra3tor drew back as I were pollution, and sternly said, -' Let the carrion rot; there are no noble
men but Romans!' And so, fellow-gladiators, must you, and so must
I, die like dogs.  0, IRome! PRome! thou hast been a tender nurse
to me. Ay! thou hast given, to that poor, gentle, timid shepherd

and a heart of flint; taught him to drive the sword through plaited
mail and links of rugged brass, and warm it in the marrow of his foe;

as a boy upon a laughing girl! And he shall pay thee back, until the

and cower like a belabored hound beneath his master's lash  0, comrades! warriors! Thracians! --if we must fight, let us fight for our-,

we must die, let it be under the clear sky, by the bright waters; in
noble, honorable battle!"
23. SPARTACUS TO TIIE ROMAN ENVOYS IN ETRURIA.--Origznai
EDvovs of Rome, the poor camp of SpartaTus is too much honored
by your presence. And does Rome stoop to parley with the escape]
gladiator, with the rebel ruffian, for whom heretofore no slight mas
been too scornfld? You have come, with steel in your right hand,
anLd with gold in your left.  What heed we give the former, ask
124MARTIAL AND POPULAR.
Gossinius; ask Claudius; ask Varinius; ask the bones of your legions
that fertilize the Lucanian plains. And for your gold --would ye
know what we do with thlat, - go ask the laborer, the trodden poor,
the helpless and the hopeless, on our route; ask all whom Roman
tyranny had crushed, or Ronman avarice plundered.  Ye have seen
me before; but ye did not then shun my glance as now.  Ye have
seen me in the arena, when I was Rome's pet ruffan, daily smeared
with bloocl of men or beasts.  One day -- shall I forget it ever? -
ye were present; - I had fought long and well. Exhausted as I was
your m    runerator, your lord of the games, bethoucght himn, it were an
equal match to set against me a new man, younger and iighter than
I, but fresh and valiant.  With Thracian sword ancl buck!er, forth he
came, a beautiful defiance on his brow! Bloody and brief the fight.
"lie has it!" cried the People; "lhafbet! habet!"  But still he
lowered not his arm, until, at length, I held himi, gzashed andt fainting,
in my power.  I looked around upon the Podiumn, where sat your
Senators and men of State, to catch the signal of release, of mercy.
But not a thumb was reversed.  To crown your sport, the vanquished
man must die! Obedient brute that I was, I was ai',out to slay him,
when a few hurried words- rather a welcome to death than a plea
for life--told me he was a Thracian.    I stood transfixed.  The
arena vanishled.  I was in Thrace, upon my native hills! TQhe sword
dropped from my hands.   I raised the dying youth tenderly in my
arms.  0, the magnanimity of Rome!    Your haughty leaders, enraged at being cheated of their death-show, hissed their disappointIment, and shouted, "Kill! "  I heeded them as I would heed the
howl of wolves.  Kill hin? - They might better have asked the
nmother to kill the babe, smiling in her face.  Ah! lhe was alrealdy
wounded unto death; and, amid the angry yells of the spectators, he
died. That night I was scourged for disobedience. I shall not forget
it.  Should memnoly fail, there are scars here to quicken it.
Woell; do not grow impatient.  Some hours after, finding myself,
with seventy fellow-gladiators, alone in the amphitheatre, the laboring
thoughnt broke forth in words.  I said, - I know not what.  I only
k-now thlLt, when I ceased, my comriades looked each other in the
face- and then burst forth the simultaneous cry -- "Lead on! lead
on, 0 Sya;rt'.cus! "  Forth we rushed, - seized what rude weapons
Chance thllrew in our way, alnd to the mountains speeded.  There,
day by day, our little band increased.  Disdainful Rome sent after us
a han(irul of her troops, with a scourge for the slave Spartacus.
Th eir weapons soon were ours.  She senlt an army; a-nd down from
old Vesuvilus we poured, and slew three thousand.  Now it was Spart.heus the dreaded rebel! A larger army, headed by the Proctor, was
sent, and routed; then anotlher still.  And always I remembered that
fierce cry, riving my heart, and calling me to "kill!"  In three
pitched battles, have I not obeyed it?  And now affrighted Rome
125THIE STANDARD SPEAKER.
sends her two Consuls, and puts forth all her strength by land and seat,
as if a Pyrraus or a Hannibal were on her borders!
Envoys of Rome!    To Lentillus and Gellius bear this message:' Their graves are measured! "  Look on that narrow stream, a silver
thread, high on the mountain's side! Slenderly it winds, but soon is
swelled by others meeting it, until a torrent, terrible and strong, it
sweeps to the abyss, where all is ruin. So Spart[cus comes on! So
swells his force,--small and despised at first, but now resistless!
On, on to Rome we come! The gladiators come! Let Opulence
tremble in all his palaces!  Let Oppression shudder to think the
oppress6d may have their turn! Let Cruelty turn pale at thought of
redder hands than his!  O! we shall not forget Rome's many lessons. She shall not find her training was all wasted upon indocile
pupils.  Now, begone! Prepare the Eternal City for our games!
24. MARULLUS TO TIHE ROMAN POPULACE. -Shakspeare.
WHEREFORE rejoice that Cresar comes in triumph?
What conquest brings he home?
What tributaries follow him to Rome,
To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things1
0, you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome!
Knew ye not Pompey? Many a time and oft
Have you climbed up to walls and battlements,
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
The life-long day, with patient expectation,
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome;
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
Have you not made an universal shout,
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
To hear the replication of your sounds,
Made in her concave shores?
And do you now put on your best attire?
And do you now cull out a holiday?
And do you now strew flowers in his way,
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?
Begone! Run to your houses, fall upon youtr knees
Pray to the Gods to intermit the plague
That needs must light on this ingratitude!
25.,IARCUS BRUT7US ON TIHE DEATH OF CMAR. -Shakpeare.
RoaMANs, countrymen, and lovers! Hle-uar me for my cause; and bi

respect to mine hquor, that you may believe.  Censure me in your
wisdom; and awake your senses, that you may the better judgoe. If
1'26MARTIAL AND'POPULAR. - SIAKSPEAR12
there be any in this assembly, - any dear friend of C(msar's, - to him ]
say, that Brutus' love to Cesar was not less than his. If, then, that
friend demand why Brutus rose against Cmsar, this is nmy answer:
Not that I loved Cm(sar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you
rather Caesar w6re living, and die all slaves, than that Cesar were
dead, to live all freemen? As Cmesar loved me, I weep for him; aMs
he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honor him, but
as he was ambitious, I slew him. There are tears, for his-love; joy,
for his fortune; honor, for his valor; and death, for his amlbition  
Who is here so base, that would be a bondman? If any, speak; for
hill have I offended.  Who is here so rude, that would not be a
Roman?    If any, speak; for him have I offended.  Who is here so
vile that will not love his country? If any, speak; for him have I
offended. I pause for a reply.
None? - Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
Cmsar than you shall do to Brutus.  The question of his death is
enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not extenu;ated, wherein he was
worthy; nor his offences enforced, for which he suffered death.
Here comes his body, mourned by MIark Aintny; who, though he
had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place
in the commonwealth: As which of you shall not?    With this I
depart: That, as I slew my best lover for the good of lRome, I have
the same dagger fobr myself, when it shall please mly country to need
iy death.
26 M4ARK ANTONY TO THE PEOPLE, ON CA,SARI'S DEATH. -Shakspeae.
FRIENDS, Romans, Countrymen! lend me your ears
I come to buiry Cmsar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones:
So let it be with Caesar! Noble Brutus
Ilath told you Cesar was ambitious:If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
And grievously hath Cmsar answered it!
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest -
For BruLtus is an honorable man!
So.are they all! all honorable men, -
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
lHe was my friend, faithful and just to me,But BruttLs sayvs he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man!
H[e hath brought many captives home to Rome,
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Cvmsar hath wept,
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff!Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;

"   Birthday of Was5bingtoB,..  39TH-IE STANDARD SPEAKER,
And Bratus is an honorable man!
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal,
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And sure he is an honorable man!
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke;
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once; not without cause:
What cause -withholds you, then, to mourn for him?
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And mnen have lost their reason! Bear with me:
Miy heart is in.the coffin there withl C(sar;
And I must pause till it come back to me.But yesterday, tle word of Cesar might
Have stood against the world; - now lies he there,
And none so poor to do him reverence!
O masters! if I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honorable men!I will not do them wrong: I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Than I will wrong such honorable men! -
But here's a parchment with the seal of Cxsar,
I found it -in his closet, -'t is his will!
Let but the commons hear this testament,Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,And they would go and kiss dead Cmsar's wounds
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood;
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it, as a rich legacy,
Unto their issue!
If you have tears, prepare to shed the-n now
You all do know this mantle:'I remember
The first timi ever C(esar put it on:'T was on a summer's evening, in his tent,--
That day he overcamne the Nervii! -
Look! in this place, ran Cassius' dagger through:
See what a rient the envious Casca made! -
Through this,- the well-beloved Brutus stabbed
And, as he plucked his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it!
As rushing out of doors,' to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knocked, or no!
For Brutus, as you know, was Cresar's angel
129MARTIAL AND POPULAR. - MILTON.
Judge, O ye Gods, how dearly Cosar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all!
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompe-y's statue, -
Which all the while ran blood! - great Ceesar fell
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Then I, and you, and all of us, fell down;
Whilst bloody treason flourished over us!
0, now you weep; and I perceive you feel
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops!
Kind souls! what! weep you when you but behold
Our Cresar's vesture wounded? - look you here!
Here is himself, - marred, as you see, by traitors!---
Good friends! sweet friends! let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny!
They that have done this deed are honorable!
What private griefs they have, alas! I know not.,
That made them do it: they are wise and honorable,
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
But, as you know me all, a plain, blunt man,
That love my friend, - and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him, -
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on.
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, --poor, poor, dumb nmlt~1
And bid them speak for me. But, were I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue
In every wound of C'asar, that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny!
27. MOLOCH TO THE FALLEN ANGELS. -Milton.
MY sentence is for open war: of wiles,
More unexpert, I boast not: them let those
Contrive who need, or when they need; not now,
For, while they sit contriving, shall the rest,
Millions that stand in arms, and longing wait
The signal to ascend, sit lingering here
Heaven's fugitives, and for their dwelling-place
9
12  THE STANDARD SPEARER.
Accept this dark opprobrious den of slhame,
The prison of His tyranny who reigns
By our delay?  No, - let us rather choose,
Armed with hell-flames and fury, all at once
O'er Ieaven's high towers to force resistless way,
Turning our tortures into horrid arms
Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise
Of His almighty engine He shall hear
Infernal thunder; and, for lightning, see
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage
Among His angels; and His Throne itself
Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire,
His own invented torments. But perhaps
The way seems difficult and steep, to scale
With upright wing against a higher foe.
Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench
Of that forgetful lake benumb not still,
That in our proper motion we ascend
Up to our native seat: descent and fall
To us is adverse. Who but felt of late,
WVhen the fierce Foe hung on our broken rear
Insulting, and pursued us through the deep,
With what compulsion and laborious flight
We sank thus low? The ascent is easy, then: -
The event is feared:- should we again provoke
Our Stronger, some worse way His wrath may find
To our destruction; if there be in hell
Fear to be worse destroyed. - What can be worse
Than to dwell here, driven out from bliss, condemned,
In this abhorred deep, to utter woe,
Where pain of unextinguishable fire
Must exercise us without hope of end,
The vassals of His anger, when the scourge
Inexorable and the torturing hour
Call us to penance?  More destroyed than thus,
WVe should be quite abolished, and expire.
What fear we, then?  What doubt we to incens
His utmost ire? which, to the height enraged,
Will either quite consume us, and reduce
To nothing this essential, - happier far,
Than miserable to have eternal being;Or, if our substance be indeed divine,
And cannot cease to be, we are at worst,
On this side nothing: and by proof we feel
Our power sufficient to disturb His Heaven,
And with perpetual inroads to alarm,
Though inaccessible, His fatal Throne:
Which, if not icetory is vet reven Te.

28. BELIAL'S ADDRESS, OPPOSING WAR.-AMilton
I SHOULD be much for open war, O Peers,
As not behind in hate, if what was urged,
Main reason to persuade immediate war,
Did not dissuade me most, and seem to cast
Ominous conjecture on the whole success;--
When he, who most excels in fact of arms,
In what he counsels, and in what excels,
MIistrustful, grounds his courage on despair
And utter dissolution, as the scope
Of all his aim, after some dire revenge!First, what revenge? - The towers of Heaven are filled
With armecd watch, that render all access
Impregnable: oft on the bordering deep
Encamp their legions: or, with obscure wing,
Scout far and wide into the realm of night,
Scorning surprise. - Or, could we break our way
By force, and, at our heels, all hell should rise,
With blackest insurrection, to confound
Heaven's purest light; yet our great Enemy,
All incorruptible, would, on His throne,
Sit unpolluted; and the ethereal mould,
Incapable of stain, would soon expel
Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire,
Victorious. Thus repulsed, our final hope
Is fiat despair: we must exasperate
The Almighty Victor to spend all His rage,
And that must end us; that must be our cure, -
To be no more. -Sad cure! -for who would lose,
Though fiill of pain, this intellectual being,
Those thoughts that wander through eternity,To perish rather, swallowed up and lost
In the wide womb of uncreated night,
Devoid of sense and motion? - And who knows,
Let this be good, whether our angry Foe
Ca, give it, or will ever? How He can,
Is doubtful; that He never will, is sure.
Niill He, so wise, let loose at once His ire,
Belike through impotence, or unaware,
To give His enemies their wish, and end
Them in His anger, whoIn His anger savm
To punish endless? -" Wherefore cease we, then  
Say they, who counsel war: "we are decreed,
Reserved, and destined to eternal woe:
lWhatever doing, what can we suffer more,
What can we suffer worse?"  Is this, then, worst,
Thus sitting, thus consulting, tlhus in arms 2
1831THE STANDARD SPEAKERi.
W hat! when we fled amain, pursued and struck
With Heaven's afflicting thunder, and besought
The deep to shelter us? this hell then seenled
A refuge from those wounds! or when we lay
Chained on the burning lake? that sure was worse,
What if the breath that kindled those grim fires,
Awaked, should blow them into seven-fold rage,
And plunge us in the flames? or, from above,
Should intermitted vengeance arm again
His red right hand to plague us? what, if all
Her stores were opened, and this firmament
Of hell should spout her cataracts of fire,
Impendent horrors, threatening hideous fall
One day upon our heads? while we, perhaps
Designing or exhorting glorious war,
Caught in a fiery tempest, shall be hurled,
Each on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey
Of racking whirlwinds; or forever sunk
Under yon boiling ocean, wrapped in chains;
There to converse with everlasting groans,
Unrespited, unpitied, unreprieved,
Ages of hopeless end? - this would be worse.
War, therefore, open or concealed, alike
My voice dissuades.
29. THE DEATH OF LEONIDAS. - Rev. George Croly.
IT was the wild midnight,- a storm was in the sky,
The lightning gave its light, and the thunder echoed by;
The torrent swept the glen, the ocean lashed the shore, -
Then rose the Spartan men, to make their bed in gore!
Swift from the deluged ground, three hundred took the shield
Then, silent, gathered round the leader of the field.
He spoke no warrior-word, he bade no trumpet blow;
But the signal thunder roared, and they rushed upon the foe.
The fiery element, showed, with one imighty gleam,
Rampart and flag and tent, like the spectres of a dream.
All up the mountain side, all down the woody vale,
A1. by the rolling tide, waved the Persian banners pale.
And King Leonidas, among the slumbering band,
Sprang foremost from the pass, lilce the lightning's living brand
Then double darkness fell, and the forest ceased to moan,
But there came a clash of steel, and a distant dying groan.
Anon, a trumpet blew, and a fiery sheet burst high,
That o'er the midnight threw a blood-red canopy.
A host glared on the hill; a host glared lby the bay;
But the Greeks rushed onward still like leopards iu thei play
132ARPTIAL AND- POPULAR. ---CiROLY.
The air was all a yell, and the earth was all a flame,
Where the Spartan's bloody steel on the silken turbans came;
And still the Greek rushed on, beneath the fiery fold,
Till, like a rising sun, shone Xerxes' tent of gold
They found a royal feast, his midnight banquet, there!
And the treasures of the East lay beneath the Doric spear
Then sat to the repast the bravest of the brave!
That feast must be their last, that spot must be their grave
They pledged old Sparta's name in cups of Syrian wine,
And the warrior's deathless fame was sung in strains divine.
They took the rose-wreathed lyres from eunuch and from slave,
And taught the languid wires the sounds that Freedom gave.
But now the morning star crowned (Eta's twilight brow,
And the Persian horn of war from the hill began to blow;
Up rose the glorious rank, to Greece one cup poured high,
Then, hand in hand, they drank, -" To Immortality!"
Fear on King Xerxes fell, when, like spirits from the tomb,
With shout and trumpet-knell, he saw the warriors come;
But down swept all his power, with chariot and with charge;
Down poured the arrowy shower, till.sank the Dorian targe.
They marched within the tent, with all their strength unstrung;
To Greece one look they sent, then:on high their torches flung;
To Heaven the blaze uprolled, like a mighty altar-fire;
And the Persians' gems and gold were the Grecians' funeral pyre.
Their King sat on his Throne, his Captains by his side,
While the flame rushed roaring on, and their paean loud replied!
Thus fought the Greek of old! Thus will he fight again!
Shall not the self-same mould bring forth the self-same men?
3  CATILINE TO THE GALLIC CONSPIRATORS. - Original Adaptatzon f-om Croly.
lMEN of Gaul  
What would you give for Freedom?For Freedom, if it stood before your eyes;
For Freedom, if it rushed to your embrace;
For Freedom, if its sword were ready drawn
To hew your chains off?
Ye would give death or life! Then marvel not
That I am here - that Catiline would join you!The great Patrician?  Yes - an hour agoBut now the rebel; Rome's eternal foe,
And your sworn friend! My desperate wrong's my pledge
There's not in Rome, - no - not upon the earth,
A man so wronged. The very ground I tread
i33THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
Is grudged me. - Chieftains! ere the moon be down,
My land will be the Senate's spoil; my life,
The mark of the first villain that will stab
For lucre. - But there's a time at hand! - Gaze on!
If I ha,d thought you cowards, I might have come
And told you lies. But you have now the thing
I am; - Rome's enemy, - and fixed as fate
To you and yours forever!
The State is weak as dust.
Rome's broken, helpless, heart-sick.  Vengeance sits
Above her, like a vulture o'er a corpse,
Soon to be tasted. Time, and dull decay,
Have let the waters round her pillar's foot;
And it must fall. Her boasted strength's a ghost,
Fearful to dastards; - yet, to trenchant swords,
Thin as the passing air! A single blow,
In this diseased and crumbling state of Rome,
Would break your chains like stubble.
But " ye've no swords "!
Have you no ploughshares, scythes?
When men are brave, the sickle is a spear!
Must Freedom pine till the slow armorer
Gilds her caparison, and sends her out
To glitter and play antics in the sun?
Let hearts be what they ought, - the naked earth
Will be their magazine; - the rocks - the treesNay, there's no idle and unnoted thing,
But, in the hand of Valor, will out-thrust
The spear, and make the mail a mockery!
31. CATILINE'S LAST HARANGUE TO HIS ARMY.--Id.
BRAVE comrades! all is ruined! I disdain
To hide the truth from you. The die is thrown!
And now, let each that wishes for long life
Put up his sword, and kneel for peace to Rome.
Ye are all free to go. - What! no man stirs'
Not one! - a soldier's spirit in you all?
Give me your hands! (This moisture in my eyes
Is womanish-'t will pass.)  My noble hearts!
Well have you chosen to die! For, in my mind,
The grave is better than o'erburthened life;Better the quick release of glorious wounds,
Than the eternal taunts of galling tongues;- -
Better the spear-head quivering in the heart,
Than daily struggle against Fortune's curse;Better, in manhood's muscle and high blood,
To leap the gulf, than totter to its edgeMARTIAL AND POPULAR. - BULWEIR1
In poverty, dull pain, and base decay.Once more, I say, - are ye resolved?
Then, each man to his tent, and take the arms
That he would love to die in,  for, this hour,
We storm the Consul's camp. - A last farewell!
When next we meet, we'11 have no time to look,
How parting clouds a soldier's countenance:--.
Few as we are, we'11 rouse them with a peal
That shall shake Rome! -
Now to your cohorts' heads, - the word's - Re,venge.
E2 THE BARD'S SUMMONS TO WARt.-Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton
LEANING against a broken parapet,
Alone with Thought, mused Caradoc the Bard,
When a voice smote him, and he turned and met
A gaze, prophetic in its sad regard.
Beside him, solemn with his hundred years,
Spoke the arch hierarch of the Cymrian seers:--
" In vain through yon dull stupor of despair
Sound Geraint's trump and Owaine's battle-cry;
In vain where yon rude clamor storms the air,
The Council Chiefs stem maddening mutiny;
From Trystan's mail the lion heart is gone,
And on the breach stands Lancelot alone!
" Drivelling the wise, and impotent the strong!
Fast into night the life of Freedom dies;
Awake, Light-Bringer, wake, bright soul of song!
Kindler, reviver, re-creator, rise!
Crown thy great mission with thy parting breath,
And teach to hosts the Bard's disdain of death! "
" So be it, 0 voice from Heaven," the Bard replied
" Some grateful tears may yet embalm my name;
Ever for human love my youth hath sighed,
And human love's divinest form is fame.
Is the dream erring? shall the song remain?
Say, can one Poet ever live in vain?"
Then rose the Bard, and, smilingly unstrung
His harp of ivory sheen, from shoulders broad
Kissing the hand that doomed his life, he sprung
Light from the shattered wall,- and swiftly strode
Where, herdlike huddled in the central space,
Drooped, in dull pause, the cowering populace.
Slow, pitying, soft it glides, - the liquid lay, -
Sad with the burth6n of the Singer's soul;
135THE STANDARD SPEAKtRER
[nto the heart it coiled its lulling wa.y,
Wave upon wave the golden river stole;
Hushed to his feet forgetful Famine crept,
And Woe, reviving, veiled the eyes that wept.
Then stern, and harsh, clashed the ascending strain,
Telling of ills more dismal yet in store;
Rough with the iron of the grinding -chain,
Dire with the curse of slavery -evermore;
Wild shrieks from lips beloved pale warriors hear,
Her child's last death-groan rends the mother's ear
Then trembling hands instinctive griped the swords;
And men unquiet sought each other's eyes;Loud into pomp sonorous swell the chords!
Like linked legions march the melodies!
Till the full rapture swept the Barcl along,
And o'er the listeners rushed the storm of song!
And the Dead spoke! From cairns and kingly graves,
The Heroes called;- and Saints fromn earliest shrine&amp;
And the Land spoke! - Mellifluous river-waves;
Dim forests awful with the roar of pines;
Mysterious caves, from legend-haunted deeps;
And torrents flashing from untrodden steeps; -
The Land of Freedom called upon the Free!
All Nature spoke; the clarions of the wind:
The organ swell of the majestic sea;
The choral stars; the Universal Mind
Spoke, like the voice from which the world begaln,
" No chain for Nature and the Soul of Ian! "
As leaps the war-fire on the beacon hills,
Leapt in each heart the lofty flame divine;
As into sunlight flash the molten rills,
Flashed the glad claymores, lightening line on line;
From cloud to cloud as thunder speeds along,
From rank to rank rushed forth the choral song.
Woman and child- all caught the fire of men;
To its own Heaven that Alleluia rang;
Life to the spectres had returned again;
And from the grave an armed Nation sprang!
S3 CARADOO, TIHE BARD TO TIIE CYMRIANS. -Sir E. Bulwer Lyttos.
No Cymrian bard, by the primitive law, could bear weapons.
HARK to the measured march! - The Saxons come!
The sound earth quails beneath the hollow tread'
Your fathers rushed upon the swords of Rome,
And climbed her war-ships, when the Coesar fled''36GMARTIAL AND POPULAR. --KNOWLES.
The Saxons come! why wait within the wall?
They scale the mountain: - let its torrents fall!
Mark, ye have swords, and shields, and armor, YE  
No mail defends the Cymrian Child of Song;
But where^ the warrior, there the Bard shall be!
All fields of glory to the bard belong!
His realm extends wherever godlike strife
Spurns the bas, death, and wins immortal life.
Unarmed he goes - his guard the shield of all,
Where he bounds foremost on the Saxon spear!
Unarmled he goes, that, falling, even his fall
Shall bring no shame, and shall bequeath no fear.!
Does the song cease? - avenge it by the deed,
And make the sepulchre - a Nation freed!
&amp;. ALFRED THE GREAT TO HIIS MEN. --Orig'inal Adaptationfrom Knowl~e
MY friends, our country must be free! The land
Is never lost that has a son to right her,And here are troops of sons, and loyal ones!
Strong in her children should a mother be:
Shall ours be helpless, that has sons like us?
God save our native land, whoever pays
The ransom that redeems her! Now, what wait we?--
For Alfred's word to move upon the foe?
Upon him, then! Now think ye on the things
You most do love!'Husbands and fathers, on
Their wives and children; lovers, on their beloved;
And all, upon their COUNTRY! When you use
Your weapons, think on the beseeching eyes,
To whet them, could have lent you tears for water!
O, now be men, or never! From your hearths
Thrust the unbidden feet, that from their nooks
Drove forth your aged sires - your wives and babes!
The couches, your fair-handed daughters used
To spread, let not the vaunting stranger press,
Weary from spoiling you! Your roofs, that hear
The wanton riot of the intruding guest,
That mocks their masters, - clear them for the sake
Of the manhood to which all that's precious clings
Else perishes. The land that bore you -!
Do honor to her! Let her glory in
Your breeding! Rescue her!   Revenge her,- -or
Ne'er call her mother more! Come on, my friends
And, where you take your stand upon the field,
However you advance, resolve on this,

35. RIENZI TO TI'E ROMANS. --lary Russell MIitford.
FRIENDS!
I come not here to talk.  Ye know too well
The story of our thraldom.  We are slaves!
The bright sun rises to his course, and lights
A race of slaves! He sets, and his last beam
Falls on a slave: not such as, swept along
By the full tide of power, the conqueror leads
To crimson glory and undying fame,But oase, ignoble slaves! - slaves to a horde
Of petty tyrants, feudal despots; lords,
Rich in some dozen paltry villages;
Strong in some hundred spearmen; only great
In that strange spell - a name! Each hour, dark fraud.
Or open rapine, or protected murder,
Cry out against them. But this very day,
An hofiest man, my neighbor, --there he stands, -
Was struck - struck like a dog, by one who wore
The badge of Ursini! because, forsooth,
IHe tossed not high his ready cap in air,
Nor lifted up his voice in servile shouts,
At sight of that great ruffian! Be we men,
And suffer such dishonor? Men, and wash not
The stain away in blood?  Such shames are common..
I have known deeper wrongs. I, that speak to ye,
I had a brother once, a gracious boy,
Full of all gentleness, of calmest hope,
Of sweet and quiet joy; there was the look
Of Heaven upon his face, which limners give
To the beloved disciple. How I loved
That gracious boy! Younger by fifte:n years
iBrother at once and son! He left my side,
A summer bloom on his fair cheeks - a smilt
Parting his innocent lips. In one short hour,
The pretty, harmless boy was slain! I saw
The corse, the mangled corse, and then I cried
For vengeance! Rouse, ye Romans! Rotse, ye slaveq
Have ye brave sons? - Look in the next fierce brawl
To see them die! Have ye fair daughters?.- Look
138MARTIAL AND POPULAR. - MONTGO(3ERY.
To see them live, torn from your arms, distained,
Dishonored; and, if ye dare call for justice,
Be answered by the lash!    Yet, this is Rome,
That sate on her seven hills, and from her throne
Of beauty ruled the world! Yet, we are Romans.
Why, in that elder day, to be a Roman
WVas greater than a King!    And once again -
Hear me, ye walls, that echoed to the tread
Of either Brutus! - once again I swear
The Eternal City shall be free!
36. THE PATRIOT'S PASS-WORD. --James MIontgomery
The noble voluntary death of the Switzer, Winkelried, is accurately described in the following verses. In the battle of Shempach, in the fourteenth century, this martyr-patriot, perceiv.
ing that there was no other means of breaking the heavy-armed lines of the Austrians than
by gathering as many of their spears as he could grasp together, opened, by this means, a
passage for his fellow-combatants, who, with hammers and hatchets, hewed down the mailed
men-at-arms, and won the victory.
"MAKE way for liberty! " he cried,--
Made way for liberty, and died!
In arms the Austrian phalanx stood,
A living wall, a human wood;
Impregnable their front appears,
All horrent with projected spears.
Opposed to these, a hovering band
Contended for their father-land;
Peasants, whose new-found strength had broke
From manly necks the ignoble yoke';
Marshalled once more at Freedom's call,
They came to conquer or to fall.
And now the work of life and death
Hung on the passing of a breath;
The fi&amp;e of conflict burned withinThe battle trembled to begin;
Yet, while the Austrians held their ground,
Point for assault was nowhere found;
Where'er the impatient Switzers gazed,
The unbroken line of lances blazed;
That line't were suicide to meet,
And perish at their tyrants' feet.
How could they rest within their graves,
To leave their homes the haunts of slaves?
Would they not feel their children tread,
With clanking chains, above their head 2
It must not be; this day, this hour,
Annihilates the invader's power!
All Switzerland is in the field,
She will not fly; she cannot yield'Till STANDARD SPEAKER.
She must not fall; her better fate
Here gives her an immortal date.
Few were the numbers she could bocst
But every freeman was a host,
And felt as't were a secret known
That one should turn the scale alone
While each unto himself was he
On whose sole arm hung Victory,
It did depend on one, indeed;
Behold him,- Arnold Winkelried!
There sounds not to the trump of Fame
The echo of a nobler name.
Unmarked, he stood amid the throng,
In rumination deep and long,
Till you might see, with sudden grace,
The very thought come o'er his face;
And, by the motion of his form,
Anticipate the bursting storml;
And, by the uplifting of his brow,
Tell where the bolt would strike, and how.
But't was no sooner thought than done,The field was in a moment won I
"Make way for liberty! " he cried,
Then ran, with arms extended wide,
As if his dearest friend to clasp;
Ten spears he swept within his grasp.
" Make way for liberty!" he cried;
Their keen points crossed from side to side;
He bowed amongst them, like a tree,
And thus made way for liberty.
Swift to the breach his comrades fly, -
" Make way for liberty! " they cry,
And through the Austrian phalanx dart,
As rushed the spears through Arnold's heart
While, instantaneous as his fall,
Rout, ruin, panic, seized them all.
An earthquake could not overthrow
A city with a surer blow.
Thus Switzerland again was free,
Thus Dea.th made way for liberty  
S7. RICHARD TO THE PRINCES OF TIIE CRUSADE.-Sir Wfalter Scotl. B 1771 i. 1832
AND is it even so? And are our brethren at such pains to note the
infirmities of our natural temper, and the rough precipitance of our zeal,
which may have sometimes urged us to issue commanLds when there
was little time to hold council? I could not have thought that fienc.e
t140MARTIAL AND POPUtAR. --SHAKSPEARE..oasual and unpremeditated, like mine, could find such deep root in the
hearts of my allies in this most holy cause, that, for my sake, they
should withdraw their hand from the plough when the furrow was
near the end; for my salke, turn aside from the direct path to Jerusalem, which their swords have opened.  I vainly thought that my
&amp;mall services might have outweighed my rash errors; that, if it
were remembered that I pressed to the van in an assault, it would not
be forgotten that I was ever the last in the retreat; that, if I elevated my banner upon conquered fields of battle, it was all the advantage I sought, while others were dividing the spoil.  I may have
called the conquered city by my name, but it was to others that I
yielded the dominion.  If I have been headstrong in urging bold
counsels, I have not, methinks, spared my own blood, or my people's.
in carrying them into as bold execution; or, if I have, in the hurry
of march or battle, assumed a command over the soldiers of others.
such have ever been treated as my own, when my wealth purchaseci
the provisions and medicines which their own sovereigns could not
procure.
But it shames me to remind you of what all but myself seem to have
forgotten.  Let us rather look forward to our future measules; and,
believe me, brethren, you shall not find the pride, or the wrath, or the
ambition of Richard, a stumbling-block of offence in the path to
which religion and glory summon you, as with the trumpet of an
archangel!  0, no, no! never would I survive the thought that my
frailties'and infirmities had been the means to sever this goodly fellowship of assembled princes.  I would cut off my left hiand with my
right, could my doing so attest my sincerity.  I will yield up, voluntarily, all right to co.mmand in the host even mine owvn liege subjects.
They shall be led by such sovereigns as you may nominate; and their
King, ever but too apt to exchange the leader's baton for the adventurer's lance, will serve under the banner of Beauseant among the
Templars,- ay, or under that of Austria, if Austria will name a
brave man to lead his forces. Or, if ye are yourselves a-weamy of this
war, and feel your armor chafe your tender bodies, leave but with
Richard some ten br fifteen thousand of your soldiers to work out the
accomplishment of your vow; and, when Zion is won, - when Zion
is won, - we will write upon her gates, not the name of 7Richard
Plantagenet, but of those generous Princes who intrusted him with
tte means of conquest!
38 rHE EARL OF RICIIMOND TO HIS ARMY.- Shakspeare.
MORE than I have said, loving countrymen.
The leisure and enforcement of the time
Forbids to dwell on.  Yet remrrember this:---
God, and our good cause, fight upon our side,
The prayers of holy saints, and wronged souls,
Like high-reared bulwarks, stand before our faces.
141THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
RIichard except, those whom we fight against
Had rather have us win than him they follow.
For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
One raised in blood, and one in blood established;
One that made means to come by what he hath,
And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;
A base, foul stone, made precious by the foil
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
One that hath ever been God's enemy.
Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
God will, in justice, guard you as his soldiers;
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
If you do fight against your country's foes,
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
If you do free your children from the sword,
Your children's children quit it in your age.
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
But, if I thrive, the gain of my attempt,
The least of you shall share his part thereof.
Sound drums and trumpets, boldly and cheerfully:
God, and St. George! Richmond and victory!

If we are marked to die, we are enow
To do our country loss; and if to live,
The fewer men, the greater share of honor.
I pray thee do not wish for one man more.

Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
dBut if' it be a sin to covet honor,
I am the most offendin(g soul alive.
No,'faith, my Lord, wish not a man from England:

As only one man more would share from me,

14.2MARTIAL AND POPULAR. - MACAULAY
Rather, proclaim it, Westmoreland, through nmy host,
That he, which hath no stomach to this fight,
Let him depart; his passport shal_ be made,
And crowns for convoy put intO his purse:
We would not die in that man's company
That fears his fellowship to die with us.
This day is called the feast of Crispiarn
le that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
Will stand a tip-toe when this day is named,
And rouse him at the name of Crispian:
He that outlives this day, and sees old age,
Will yearly onl the vigil feast his neighbors,
And say - to-morrow is Saint Crispian!
Then will he strip his sleeve, and show his scars.
Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot
But he'11 remember, with advantages,
What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,-.
Familiar in his mouth as household words,Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloster,Be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.
This story shall the good man teach his son:
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
From this day to the ending of the world,
But we in it shall be remembered;
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers:
For he, to-day that sheds his blood with me,
Shall be my brother: be he ne'er so vile,
This day shall gentle his condition.
And gentlemen in England, now a-bed,
Shall think themselves accursecl they were not here;

Tlhrough thy corn-fields green, and sunny vales, 0 pleasant land of
France!
And thou, Rochelle, our own Roehelle, proud city of the waters,
Again let rapture light the eyes of all thy mourning daughters;
As thou wert constant in our ills, be joyous in our joy,

0. how our hearts were beating, whLen, at the dawn of day.
We saw the army of the League drawn out in long array;
With all its priest-led citizens, and all its:ebel peers,
And App3nzel's stout inftantry, and Egmont's Flemish spears!
There rode the brood of false Lorraine, the curses of our land!
And dark Mayenne was in the midst, a truncheon in his hand;
And, as we looked on them, we thought of Seine's einpurpled flood
And good'Joligni's hoary hair all dabbled with his blood;
And we cried unto the living God, who rules the fate of war,
To fight for His own holy Nanme, and Henry of Navarre.
The King has come to marshal us, in all his armor drest,
And he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant crest.
He looked upon his People, and a tear was in his eye;
IHle looked upon the traitors, and his glance was stern and high.
Right graciously he smiled on us, as rolled from wing to wing,
Down a' ll our line, in deafening shout, " God save our lord, the King! i
"A' nd if my standard-bearer fall, -as fall full well he may,
For never saw I promise yet of such a bloody fray, -
Press where ye see my white plume shine, amicl the ranks of war,
And be your orifiamme, to-day, the helmet of Navarre."
Hurrah! the foes are moving! Hark to the mingled din
Of fife, and steed, and trumnp, and drum, and roaring culverin'
The fiery Duke is pricking fast across Saint Andre's plain,
With all the hireling chivalry of Guelders and Ahnayne.
Now, by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of France,
Charge for the golden lilies now, upon them with the lance!
A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest,
A thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest,
-nd in tlhey burst, and on they rushed, while, like a guiding star,
Amidst the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of Navarre.
Now, Gocl be praised, the day is ours! Mayenne hath turned his rein,
D'Aumale ha,lth cried for quarter - the Flemish Count is slain;
Their ranlks are break}ing like thin clouds before a Bi-.iy gale;
The field is heaped with bleeding steeds, and flags, and cloven mail  
And then we thought on vengeance, and all along our van
"Remember St. Bartholomnew " was passed from man to man,
But out spake gentle Henry, then, -" No Frenchman is my foe;
Down, down with every foreigner! but let your brethren go."

As our sovereign lord, King H-enry, the soldier of Navarre!
Io! maidens of Vienna! Ho! matrons of Ljucerne!

41. PIIILIP VAN ARTEVELDE TO THE MEN OF GHENT.-Henry Taylor,
SIRS, ye have heard these knights discourse to you
Of your ill fortunes, telling on their fingers
The worthy leaders ye have lately lost.
True, they were worthy men, most gallant chiefs;
And ill would it become us to make light
Of the great loss we suffer by their falL
They died like heroes; for no recreant step
Had e'er dishonored them, no stain of fear,
No base despair, no cowardly recoil.
They had the hearts of freemen to the last,
And the free blood that bounded in their veins
Was shed for freedom with a liberal joy.
But had they guessed, or could they but have dreamed
The great examples which they died to show
Should fall so fiat, should shine so fruitless here,
That men should say, " For liberty these died,
Wherefore let us be slaves," - had they thought thiz
0, then, with what an agony of shame,
Their blushing faces buried in the dust,
Had their great spirits parted hence for Heaven!
What! shall we teach our chroniclers henceforth
To write, that in five bodies were contained
The sole brave hearts of Ghent! which five defunct,
The heartless town, by brainless counsel led,
Delivered up her keys, stript off her robes,
And so with all humility besought
Her haughty Lord that he would scourge her lightly
It shall not be- no, verily! for now,
Thus looking on you as ye stand before me,
Mine eye can single out full many a man
Who lacks but opportunity to shine
As great and glorious as the chiefs that fell.
But, lo! the Earl is "mercifully minded "!
And, surely, if we, rather than revenge
The slaughter of our bravest, cry them shame,
And fall upon our knees, and say we'e sinned,
rhen will my Lord the Earl have mercy on us.,
And pardon us our strike for liberty!

145THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
0, Sirs! look round you, lest ye be deceived
Forgiveness may be spoken with the tongue,
Forgiveness may be written with the pen,
But think not that the parchment and mouth pardon
WTill e'er eject old hatreds from the heart.
There's that betwixt you been which men remember
Till they forget themselves, till all's forgot, -
Till the deep sleep falls on them in that bed
From which no morrow's mischief rouses them.
There's that betwixt you been which you yourselves,
Should ye forget, would then not be yourselves,
For must it not be thought some base men's souls
Have ta'en the seats of yours and turned you out,
If, in the coldness of a craven heart,
Ye should forgive this bloody-mlinded man
For all his black and murderous monstrous crimes!
91 WAT TYLER'S ADDRESS TO THE KING. -Robert Southey. B. 1774; d. 1l1a
KING of England,
Petitioning for pity is most weak,The sovereign People ought to demand justice.
I lead them here against the Lord's anointed,
Because his Ministers have made him odious!
His yoke is heavy, and his burden grievous.
Why do ye carry on this fatal war,
To force upon the French a King they hate;
Tearing our young men from their peaceful homes,
Forcing his hard-earned fruits from the honest peasant,
Distressing us to desolate our neighbors?
Why is this ruinous poll-tax imposed,
But to support your Court's extravagance,
And your mad title to the Crown of France?
Shall we sit tamely down beneath these evils,
Petitioning for pity?  King of England,
Why are we sold like cattle in your markets,
Deprived of every privilege of man?
Must we lie tamely at our tyrant's feet,
And, like your spanliels, lick the hand that beats us
You sit at ease in your gay palaces:
The costly banquet courts your appetite;
Sweet music soothes your slumnbers: we, the while,
Scarce by hard toil can earn a little food,
And sleep scarce sheltered from the cold night wind,
Whilst your wild projects wrest the little from us
Which milht have cheered the wintry hours of age  
The Parlialment forever asks more money;
146MARTIAL AND POPULAR..- WOLFE.
We toil and sweat for money for your taxes;
Where is the benefit, - what good reap we
From all the counsels of your government?
Think you that we should quarrel with the French T
What boots to tus your victories, your glory?
We pay, we fight, -you profit at your ease t
Do you not claim the country as your own?
Do you not call the venison of the forest,
The birds of Heaven, your own? - prohibiting us,
Even though in want of food, to seize the prey
Which Nature offers? King! is all this just?
Think you we do not feel the wrongs we suffer'?
The hour of retribution is at hand,
And tyrants tremble,- mark me, King of Enlgltand 1
43. THE SOLDIER'S DREAM.--Thomas Campbell.
(CvuTR bugles sang truce, for the night-cloud had lowered,
And the sentinel stars set their watch in tlhe sky;
And thousands had sunk on the ground overpowered,
The weary to sleep, and the wounded to die.
When reposing that night on my pallet of straw,
By the wolf-scaring fagot that guarded the slain,
At the dead of the night a sweet vision I saw,
And thrice ere the morning I dreamed it agoairn.
Methought, from the battle-field's dreadful array,
Far, far I had roamed on a desolate track;'T was autumn, - and sunshine arose on the way
To the home of my fathers, that welconmed lme back.
I flew to the pleasant fields, traversed so oft
In life's morning march, when my bosom was young
I heard my own mountain-goats bleating aloft,
And knew the sweet strain that the corn-reapers sung.
Then pledged we the wine-cup, and fondly I swore
From my home and my weeping friends never to part;
3By little ones kissed me a thousand tilmes o'er,
And my wife sobbed aloud in her fulness of heart.
-Stay, stay with us,- rest, thou art weary and worn "!
And fain was their war-broken soldier to stay, -
But sorrow returned with the dawning of morn,
And the voice in my dreaming ear nielted away.

sarmounted; and the city of Quebec, the object of all our toils, now
%tands in full view before us. A perfidious enemy, who have dared to
exasperate you by their cruelties, but not to oppose you on equal
ground, are now constrained to face you on the open plain, without
ramparts or intrenchments to shelter them.
You know too well the forces which compose their army to dread
their superior numbers.  A few regular troops from old France, weakened b,y hunger and sickness, who, when fresh, were unable to withstand the British soldiers, are their General's chief dependence. Those
iiuinerous companies of Canadians, insolent, mutinous, unsteady, and
iil-lisciplined, have exercised his utmost skill to keep them together to
this time; and, as soon as their irreguliar ardor is damped by one firm
fire, they will instantly turn their backs, and give you no further
trouble but in the pursuit.  As for those savage tribes of Indians,
w'hose horrid yells in the forests have struck many a bold heart witl
affright, terrible as they are with a tomahawk and sealping-knife to a
flying and prostrate foe, you have experienced how little their ferocit~ is
to be dreaded by resolute men upon fair and open ground: you can
now only consider them as the just objects of a severe revenge for the
unhappy fate of many slaughtered countrymen.
This day puts it into your power to terminate the fatigues of a sieg)
which has so long employed your courage and patience. Possessed
with a full confidence of the certain success which British valor must
gain over such enemies, I have led you up these steep and dangerous
roeks, only solicitous to show you the foe within your reach. The
impossibility of a retreat makes no difference in the situation of men
resolved to conquer or die: and, believe me, my friends, if your conquest could be bought with the blood of your General, he would most
cheerfully resign a life which he has long devoted to his country,

WHEN Freedom, from her mountain height,
Unfurled her standard to the air,
She tore the azure robe of.night,
And set the stars of glory there.
She mingled with its gorgeous dies
The milky baldric of the skies,
And striped its pure celestial white,
With streakings of the morning light;
Then, from his mansion in the sun,
She called her eagle bearer down,
And gave into his mighty hand
The symbol of her chosen land.
Majestic monarch of the cloud,
Who rear'st aloft thy regal form,
To hear the tempest triupings loud

When strive the warriors of the storm,
And rolls the thunder-drum of Heaven,
Child of the Sun! to thee't is given
To guard the banner of the free;
To hover in the sulphur smoke,
To ward away the battle-stroke;
And bid its blendings shine afar,
Like rainbows on the cloud of war,
The harbingers of victory!
Flag of the brave! thy folds shall fly,
The sign of hope and triumph high.
When speaks the signal trumpet tone,
And the long line comes gleaming on,Ere yet the life-blood, warm and wet,
Has dimmed the glistening bayonet, -
Each soldier's eye shall brightly turn
To where thy sky-born glories burn;
And, as his springing steps advance,
Catch war and vengeance from the glance.
And, when the cannon-mouthings loud
Heave in wild wreaths the battle shroud,
And gory sabres rise and fall
Like shoots of flame on midnight's pall,
Then shall thy meteor glances glow,
And cowering -foes shall fall beneath
Each gallant arm that strikes belowv
That lovely messenger of death.
Flag of the seas! on ocean's wave
Thy stars shall glitter o'er the brave.
When Death, careering on the gale,
Sweeps darkly round the bellied sail,
And frighted waves rush wildly back,
Before the broadside's reeling rack,'
Each dying wanderer of the sea
Shall look at once to Heaven and thee;
And smile to see thy splendors fly,
In triumph, o'er his closing eye.
Flag of the free heart's hope and home!
By angel hands to Valor given!
Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,
And all thy hues were born in Heaven.
Forever float that standard sheet!

With Freedom's soil beneath our feet,
And Freedom's banner streamling o'er us?

46. TO TIE AMERICAN TROOPS BEFORE THE BATTLE OF LONG ISLAND, 177 -_
General George WHashington. Born, 1732; died, 1799
THE time is now near at hand which must probably determine
whether Americans are to be freemen or slaves; whether they are tj
have any property they can call their own; whether their houses and
farms are to be pillaged and destroyed,-and themselves consigned to a
state of wretchedness from which no human efforts will deliver them.
The fate of unborn millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and conduct of this-army.  Our cruel and unrelenting enemy
leaves us only the choice of a brave resistance, or the most abject submission. We have, therefore, to resolve to conquer or to die.
Our own, our country's honor, calls upon us for a vigorous and
manly exertion; and if we now shamefully fail, we shall become
infamous to the whole world. Let us, then, rely on the goodness of
our cause, and the aid of the Supreme Being, in whose hands victory
is, to animate and encourage us to great and noble actions. The eyes
of all our countrymen are now upon us; and we shall have their blessings and praises, if happily we are the instruments of saving them
from the tyranny meditated against them. Let us, therefore, animate
and encourage each other, and show the whole world that a freeman
contending for liberty on his own ground is superior to any slavish
mercenary on earth.
Liberty, property, life and honor, are all at stake. Upon your
courage and conduct rest the hopes of our bleeding and insulted
country.  Our wives, children and parents, expect safety from us
only; and they have every reason to believe that Heaven will crown
with success so just a cause. The enemy will endeavor to intimidate
by show and appearance; but remember they have been repulsed on
various occasions by a few brave Americans. Their cause is bad,--
their men are conscious of it; and, if opposed with firmness and cool.
ness on their first onset, with'our advantage of works, and knowledge
of the ground, the victory is most assuredly ours. Every good soldier
will be.silent and attentive, wait for orders, and reserve his fire
until he is sure of doing execution.

SOLDERS! You have precipitated yourselves like a torrent from the
Apennines. You have overwhelmed or swept before you all that
opposed your march. Piedmont, delivered from Austrian oppression
has returned to her natural sentiments of peace and friendship towards
France.  Milan is yours; and over all Lombardy floats the flag of
the Republic.  To your generosity only, do the Dukes of Farma and
of Modena now owe their political existence. The army which proudly
threatened you finds no remaining barrier of defence against your

day. Thos;. vaunted ramparts of Italy proved insufficient, y ou tray
ersed them  as rapidly as you did the Apennines.   Successes sa
numerous and brilliant have carried joy to the heart of your country.
Your representatives have decreed a festival, to be celebrated in ali
the communes of the Republic, in honor of your victories. There will
your fathers, mothers, wives, sisters, all who hold you dear, rejoice
over your triumphs, and boast that you belong to them.
Yes, Soldiers, you have done much; but much still remains for you
to do. Shall it be said of us that we knew how to conquer, but not
to profit by victory? Shall posterity reproach us with having found
a Capiua in Lombardy?    Nay, fellow-soldiers! I see you already
eager to cry "to arms! "  Inaction fatigues you; and days lost to
glory are to you days lost to happiness. Let us, then, begone! We
have yet many forced marches to make; enemies to vanquish; laurels
to gather; and injuries to avenge! Let those who have sharpened
the poniards of civil war in France, who have pusillanimously assassinated our Ministers, who have burned our vessels at Toulon, --let
them now tremble! The hour of vengealnce has knolled!
But let not the People be disquieted.  We are the friends of every
People: and more especially of the descendants of the Brutuses, the
Scipios; and other great men to whom we look as bright exemplars. To
reestablish the Capitol; to place there with honor the statues- of the
heroes who made it memorable; to rouse the Roman Peopie, unnerved by many centuries of oppression,- such will be some of the
fruits of our victories. They will constitute an epoch for posterity.
To you, Soldiers, will belong the immortal honor of redeeming the
fairest portion of Europe. The French People, free and respected by
the whole world, shall give to Europe a glorious peace, which shall
indemnify it for all the sacrifices which it has borne, the last six
years. Then, by your own firesides you shall repose; and your fellow,
citizens, when they point out any one of you, shall say: " He belonged
to the army of Italy!"

pressors! What sound more awakening to the brave than the clank
of his country's fetters? Should the sword ever tremble in your
grasp, remember yesterday! think of to-morrow!
For myself, in return for the alliance which I bring you, I ask but
the recompense of an honorable grave. I ask but the privilege of
shedding my blood with you, in your sacred cause. I ask but to
know, in dying, that I too belong to Greece - to liberty! Yes, might
the Pilgrim hope that, on the pillars of a new Parthenon, his name
might, one day, be inscribed,- or, that in the nobler mausoleum of
your hearts his memory might be cherished,- he were well content.
The tomb where Freedom weeps can never have been prematurely
teached by its inmate. Such martyrdom is blessed, indeed. What
higher fortune can ambition covet?
49. BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE, 1809 -Rev Charles Wolfe.
NOT a drum was heard, not a funeral note,
As his corse to the rampart we hurried;
Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
O'er the grave where our hero we buried.
We buried him darkly, at dead of night,
The sods with our bayonets turning;
3By the struggling moonbeams' misty light,
And the lantern dimly burning.
No useless coffin enclosed his breast,
Nor in sheet, nor in shroud, we wound him;
But he lay, like a warrior taking his rest,
With his martial cloak around him.
Few and short were the prayers we said,
And we spoke not a word of sorrow;
But we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead,
And we bitterly thought of the morrow.
We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed,
And smoothed down his lonely pillow,
That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head,
And. we far away on the billow  
152MARTIAL AND POPULAR. -  A- MPBELL.
Lightly they'11 talk of the spirit that's gone,
And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him;
But little he'i reek, if they let him sleep on,
In the grave wher6 a Briton has laid him!
But half of our heavy task was done,
WRhen the clock struck the hour for retiring,
And we heard the distant and random gun,
That the foe was sullenly firing.
Slowly and sadly we laid him down,
From the field of his fame, fresh and gory!
We carved not a line, we raised not a stone,
But we left him -alone with his glory!
v THE BATTLE OF HOHENLINDEN, 1800. - Thomas CampbeU
ON Linden when the sun was low,
All bloodless lay the untrodden snow,
Ai d dark as winter was the flow
Of Iser, rolling rapidly.
But Linden saw another sight,
When the drum beat at dead of night,
Commanding fires of death to light
The darkness of her scenery.
By torch and trumpet fast arrayed,
Each warrior drew his battle-blade,
And furious every charger neighed,
To join the dreadful revelry.
Then shook the hills with thunder riven,
Then rushed the steeds to battle driven,
And louder than the bolts of Heaven
Far flashed the red artillery.
And redder yet those fires shall glow
On Linden's hills of, blood-stainced snow,
And darker yet shall be the flow
Of Iser rolling rapidly.'T is morn; but scarce yon lurid sun
Can pierce the war-clouds, rolling dun,
While furious Frank and fiery Hun
Shout in their sulphurous canopy.
The combat deepens. On, ye brave
Who rush to glory, or the grave!
WaVy, Munich, all thy banners wave~
And charge with all thy chivllry  
1.58.qTHE STANDARD SPEAKKER.
Xh! few shall part where many meet.
The snow shall be their winding-sheet.
And every turf beneath their feet
Shall be a sol'dier's sepulchre
51 SONG OF THE GREEKS 1822.-Thomas CampbeUll.
AGAIN to the battle, Achaians!
Our hearts bid the tyrants defiance;
Our land,--the first garden of Liberty's tree,It has been, and shall yet be, the land of the free
For the cross of our faith is replanted,
The pale dying crescent is daunted,
And we march that the foot-prints of Mahomet's slaves
May be washed out in blood from our forefathers' graves.
Their spirits are hovering o'er us,
And the sword shall to glory restore us.
Ah! what though no succor advances,
Nor Christendom's chivalrous lances
Are stretched in our aid? - Be the combat our own t
And we'i perish or conquer more proudly alone;
For w've sworn by our country's assaulters,
f)v 0' vL'gins they've dragged from our altars,
By our mlassacred patriots, our children in chains,
By our heroes of old, and their blood in our veins,
That, living, we will be victorious,
Or that, dying, our deaths shall be glorious.
A breath of submission we breathe not:
The sworid that we've drawn we will sheathle not
Its scabbard is left where our martyrs are laid,
Anld the vengeance of ages has whetted its blade.
Earth may hide, waves engulf, fire consume us;
But they shall not to slavery doom us:
If they rule, it shall be o'er our ashes and graves:--
But we've smote theIn already with fire on the waves,
And new triunmphs on land are before us;To the charge! -Heaven's banner is o'er us.
This day - shall ye blush for its story?
Or brighten your lives with its glory? -
Our women -O0, say, shall they shriek in despair,
Or embrace us from conquest, with wreaths in their hair r
Accursed may his memory blacken,
If a coward there be that would slacken
Till we've trampled the turban, and shown ourselves worth
Being sprung from, and named for, the god-like of earth
154MARTIAL AND POPULAR. - CAMPBELL.
Strike home! -and the world shall reverc tas
As heroes descended from heroes.
Old Greece lightens up with emotion!
Her inlands, her isles of the ocean,
Fanes rebuilt, and fair towns, shall with jubilee ring,
And the Nine shall new hallow their Helicon's spring.
Our hearths shall be kindled in gladness,
That were cold, and exting,uished in sadness;
Whilst our maidens shall dance with their white waving ai un.
Singing joy to the brave that delivered their charms,When the blood of yon Mussulman cravens
Shall have crimsoned the beaks of our ravens!
52. FALL OF WARSAW, 1794. - Thomas Campbell.
O! SACRED Truth! thy triumph ceased a while,
And Hope, thy sister, ceased with thee to smile,
When leagued Oppression poured to Northern wars
Her whiskered pandours and her fierce hussars,
Waved her dread standard to the breeze of morn,
Pealed her loud drumn, and twanged her trumpet horn
Tumultuous horror brooded o'er her van,
Presaging wrath to Poland - and to man!
Warsaw's last champion from her heights surveyed
Wide o'er the fields a waste of ruin laidO Heaven! he cried, my bleeding country save!
Is there no hand on high to shield the brave?
Yet, though destruction sweep thesQ lovely plains,
Rise, fellow-men! our country yet remains!
By that dread name, we wave the sword on high,
And swear for her to live! - with her to die!
He said; and on the rampart heights arrayed
His trusty warriors, few, but undismayed;
Firm paced and slow, a horrid front they. form,
Still as the breeze, but dreadful as the storm;
Low, murmuring sounds along their banners fly,"Revenge, or death! "- the watchword and reply;
Then pealed the notes, omnipotent to charm,
And the loud tocsin tolled their last alarm!
In vain, alas! in vain, ye gallant few!
From rank to rank your volleyed thunder flew;0! bloodiest picture in the book of Time,
Sarmatia fell, unwept, without a crime;
Found not a generous friend, a pitying foe,
Strength in her arms, nor mercy in her woe!
Dropped from her nerveless grasp the shattered spear,
156THIE STANDARD SPEAKER.
Closed her bright eye, and curbed her high career
Hope for a seas(nm, bade the world farewell,
And Freedom shrieked, as Kosciusko fell!
O righteous HIeaven! ere Freedom found a grave,
Why slept the sword, omnipotent to save?
Where was thine arm, O vengeance! where thy rod,
That smote the foes of Sion and of God?
Departed spirits of the mighty dead!
Ye that at Marathon and Leuctra bled!
Friends of the world! restore your swords to man,
Fight in his sacred cause, and lead the van!
Yet for Sarmatia's tears of blood atone,
And make her arm puissant as your own!
O! once again to Freedom's cause return
The patriot Tell,- the Bruce of Bannockburn!
Yes, thy proud lords, unpitied land! shall see
That man hath yet a soul, - and dare be free!
A little while, along thy saddening plains,
The starless night of Desolation reigns;
Truth shall restore the light by Nature given,
And, like Prometheus, bring the fire of Heaven!
Prone to the dust Oppression shall be hurled,
Her name, her nature, withered from the world!
53 MARCO BOZZARIS. -Fitz-Greene Halleck.
Marco Bozzaris, the Epaminondas of modern Greece, fell in a night attack upon the Turki-t
camp at Laspi, the site of the ancient Plateea, August 20, 1823, and expired in the moment of
victory. His last words were: -" To die for liberty is a pleasure, and not a pain."
AT midnight, ii his guarded tent,
The Turk was dreaming of the hour
When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent.
Should tremble at his power:
In dreams through camp and court he bore
The trophies of a conqueror;
In dreams his song of triumph heard;
Then wore his monarch's signet ring,Then pressed that monarch's throne,- a king
As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing
As Eden's garden bird.
An hour passed on,- the Turk awoke  
That bright dream was his last;
He woke, to hear his sentries shriek,"To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek
He woke, to die midst flame and smoke,
And shout, and groan, and sabre-stroke,
And death-shots falling thick and fast
15615k,
MARTIAL AND POPULAR. - IIALLECE.
As lightnings from the mountain cloud,
And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,
Bozzaris cheer his band:"Strike- till the last armed foe expires!
Strike -for your altars and your fires!
Strike - for the green graves of your sires!
God, and your native land t "
They fought, like brave men, long and well;
They piled the ground with Moslem slain;
They conquered; but Bozzaris fell,
Bleeding at every vein.
His few surviving comrades saw
-Iis smile, when rang their proud hurrah,
And the red field was won;
Then saw in death his eyelids close,
Calmly, as to a night's repose,
Like flowers at set of sun.
Come to the bridal chamber, Death!
Come to the mother's when she feels
For the first time her first-born's breath;
Come when the blessed seals
That close the pestilence are broke,
And crowded cities wail its stroke;
Come in Consumption's ghastly form,
The earthquake shock, the ocean storm;
Come when the heart beats high and warm,
With banquet song, and dance, and wine,
And thou art terrible: the tear,
The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,
And all we know, or dream, or fear.
Of agony, are thine.
But to the hero, when his sword
Has won the battle for the free,
Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word,
And in its hollow tones are heard
The thanks of millions yet to be..
Bozzaris! with the storied brave
Greece nurtured in her glory's time,
Rest thee: there is no prouder grave,
Even in her own proud clime.
We tell thy doom without a sigh;
For thou art Freedom's now, and Fame's~,One of the few, the immortal names,
That were not born to die!INDEX TO NAMES OF AUTHORS, ET!C.

54 THE SEMINOI,E'S DEFIANCE. - G. W. Pattern
BLAZE, with your serried columns! I will not bend the knpe;
The shackle mle'er again shall bind the arm which now is free!
i've mailled it with the thunder, when the tempest muttered low,
And.where it falls, ye well may dread the lightning of its blow.
I've scared you in the city; I've scalped you on the plain;
Go, count your chosen where they fell beneath my leaden rain!
I scorn your proffered treaty; the pale-face I defy;
Rleyenge is stamped upon my spear, anld "blood" my battle-cry!
Some strike for hope of booty; some to defend their all; -
I battle for the joy I have to see the white man fall.
I love, among the wounded, to hear his dying moan,
And catch, while chanting at his side, the niusic of his groan.
Ye've trailed me through the forest; ye've tracked me o'er the stream
And struggling through the everglade your bristling bayonets gleam
But I stand as should the warrior, with his rifle and his spear;
The scalp of vengeance still is red, and warns you, -" Come not here!
Think ye to find my homestead?- I gave it to the fire.
My tawny household do ye seek? - I am a childless sire.
But, should ye crave life's nourishment, enough I have, and good;
I live on hate, -'t is all my bread; yet light is not my food.
r loathe you with my bosom! I scorn you with mine eye!
And I'11 taunt you with my latest breath, and fight you till I die!
I ne'er will ask for quarter, and I ne'er will be your slave;
But I'11 swim the sea of slaughter till I sink beneath the wave!

FATHER of earth and Heaven! I call thy name!
Round me the smoke and shout of battle roll;
My eyes are dazzled with the rustling flame;
Father! sustain an untried soldier's soul.
Or life, or death, whatever be the goal
That crowns or closes round the struggling hour,
Thou knowest, if ever from my spirit stole
One deeper prayer,'t was that no cloud imight lower
On my young fame! - 0 hear! God of eternal power!
Now for the fight! Now for the cannon-peal!
Forward, -- through blood, and toil, and cloud, and fire
Glorious the shout, the shock, the crash of steel,
The volley's roll, the rocket's blasting spire!
They shake! like broken waves their squares retire!
On them, hussars! Now give them rein and heel;
Think of the orphaned child, the murdered sire:
Earth cries for blood!  In thunder on them wheel!
This hour to Europe's fate shall set the triumph-seal!
1,SPART THIRD.
SENATORIAL.
1. AGAINST PHILIP. -Demosthenes. Original Translation.
Demosthenes, vhose claim to the title of the greatest of orators lhas not yet been supersedc]d,
sas born at Athe ns, about 380 B C. At the age of seventeen he determined to study eloquence,
though his lungs were weak, his articulation imperfect, and his gestures awkward. These
impediments lie overcame by perlseverance. When the encroachments of Philip, Kiing of Macedon, alarmed the Grecian states, Demosthenes roused his countrymen to resistance by a series
of harangues, so celebrated, that similar orations are, to this day, often styled Philippics. The
influence which he acquired he employed for the good of his country. The charges that have
come down of his cowardice and venality are believed to be calumnious. It is related of Demosthenes, that, whlile studying Oratory, he spoke with pebbles in his mouth, to cure himself of
stammering * that he repeated verses of the poets as he ran up hill, to strengthlen his voice,
and that he declaimed on the sea-shore, to accustom himself to the tumult of a popular assembly. He died 322 B. C. The speeches of Demosthenes were delivered before select, not accidental, assemblages of the people; and they have here been placed under the Senatorial head,
as partaking mostly of that style of Oratory. The first four extracts, fromr the first, third,
eighth and ninth Philippics, which follow, together with the extract from LEschines on the
Crown, are chiefly translated from StiCvenart's excellent and very spirited version.
BEGIN, 0 men of Athens, by not despairing of your situation, however deplorable it may seem; for the very cause of your formet
reverses offers the best encouragement for the future. And how?
Youir utter supineness, 0 Athenians, has brought about your disasters.
If these had come upon you in spite of your most strenuous exertions,
then  only might all hopes of an amelioration in        your affairs be abandoned.   When, then, 0      my countrymen!      when    will you do your
duty?   What wait you?     Truly, an event! or else, by Jupiter, necessity!  But how can we construe otherwise what has already occurred?
For myself, I can conceive of no necessity more urgent to free souls
than the pressure of dishonor.      Tell me, is it your wish to go about
the public places, here and there, continually, asking, " What is there
new?"    Ah! what should there be new, if not that a Macedonian
could conquer Athens, and lord it over Greece?           " Is Philip dead? "
"No, by Jupiter! he is sick."        Dead or sick, what matters it to you?
If he were to die, aind your vigilance were to continue slack as now,
yoni would cause a new Philip to rise up at once, -        since this one owes!tis,agrandizement less to his own power than to your inertness!
lit is a matter of astonishment to me, 0 Athenians, tha.t none of you
tr arousetd either to reflection- or to anger, in beholding a war, begun
fbr twem Chastisemeint of Philip, dogeneri-,te at last into it war of defence:atnunst hin.    And it is evidaent tht liethat  will not stop even yet, unless
ie lr o his profress..   But wlcre it,':. skeld, shall we mn.:ke a descent.THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
Let us but attack, 0, Athenians, and the war itself will disclose the
enemy's weak point.  But, if we tarry at home, lazily listening to
speech-makers, in their emulous abuse of one another, never, - no,
never, shall we accomplish a single necessary step!
Some among you, retailing the news, affirm that Philip is plotting
with Lacedoemon the ruin of Thebes and the dismemberment of our
democracies; others make him send ambassadors to the Great King;
others tell us he is fortifying places in Illyria.  All have their different stories.  For myself, Athenians, I do, by the Gods, believe that
this man is intoxicated by his magnificent exploits; I believe that a
thousand dazzling projects lure his imagination; and that, seeing no
barrier opposed to his career, he is inflated by success.  But, trust me,
he does not so combine his plans that all our fools of low degree may
penetrate them; which fools - who are they but the gossips?  If,
leaving them to their reveries, we would consider that this man is our
enemy, - our despoiler, - that we have long endured his insolence;
that all the succors, on which we counted, have been turned against
ms; that henceforth our only resource is in ourselves; that, to refuse
now to carry the war into his dominions, would surely be to impose
upon us the fatal necessity of sustaining it at the gates of Athens'
--if we would comprehend all this, we should then know what it imports us to know, and discard all idiot conjectures. For it is not your
duty to dive into the future; but it does behoove you to look in the face
the calamities which that future must bring, unless you shake off your
present heedless inactivity.
2. DEGENERACY OF ATHENS. -Demosthenes. Original Translatzon.
CONTRAST, 0 nien of Athens, your conduct with that of your an
cestors. Loyal towards the People of Greece, religious towards thi
Gods, faithful to the rule of. civic equality, they mounted, by a sure
path, to the summit of prosperity.  What is your condition, under
your present complaisant rulers? Is it still the same? Hlas it in any
respect changed?  In how many! I confine myself to this simpk
fact: Sparta prostrate, Thebes occupied elsewhere, - with no power
eapable of disputing our sovereignty,- able, in fact, in the peaceable
possession of our own domains, to be the umpire of other Nations, -
what have we done?   WVe have lost our own provinces; and dissi
pated, with no good result, more than fifteen hundred talents; the
allies which we had gained by war your counsellors have deprived us
of by peace; and we have traineti up to power our formidable foo,
WVhosoever denies this, let him stand forth, and tell me where, then,
has this Philip drawn his strength, if not from the very bosom of
Athens?
Ah! but surely, if abroad we -have been weakened, our interior
administration is more flourishing. And what are the evidences of
this?  A few whitewashed ramparts, repaired roads, fountains, baga160SENATORIAL. - - DEMOSTIIENES.
telies! Turn--turn your eyes on the functionaries, to whom we
owe these vanities. This one has passed from misery to opulence:
that one, from obscurity to splendor. Another has built for himself
sumptuous palaces, which look down upon the -edifices of the State.
Ind3ed, the more the public fortunes have declined, the more have
theirs ascended. Tell us the meaning of these contrasts! Why is it,
that formerly all pro~sered, while now all is in jeopardy? It is
[i wause formerly the P1eople, itself, daring to wage war, was the master of its functionaries, the sovereign dispenser of all favors. It is'because individual citizens were then glad to receive from the People
honors, magistracies, benefits. How are the times changed! All
favors are in the gift of our functionaries; everything is under their
control; while you--you, the People!--enervated in your habits,
mutilated in your means, and weakened in your allies, stand like
so many supernumeraries and lackeys, too happy if your worthy
chiefs distribute to you the fund for the theatre - if they throw to
you a meagre pittance.! And- last degree of baseness! - you kiss
the hand which thus makes largess to you of your own! Do they
not imprison you within your own Walls, beguile you to your ruin,
tame you and fashion you to their yoke? Never, 0! never can a
manly pride and a noble courage impel men, subjected to vile and
unworthy actions! The life is necessarily the image of the heart. And
your degeneracy - by IHewen, I should not be surprised if I, in
charging it home upon you, exposed myself, ratlher than those who
have brouglht you to it, to your resentment! To be candid, firankness
of speech does not every day gain the entrance of your ears; and
that you suffer it now, may well be matter of astonishment!
S. A DEMOCRACY HATFFUL TO PHILIP.--Id. Orig,inal Translation.
THERE are persons among you, O Athenians, who think to confound a speaker by asking, "What, then, is to be done? "  To which
I might answer: "Nothing that you are doing--everything that
you leave undone! " And it would be a just and a true reply. But
[ will be more explicit; and may these men, so ready to question, be
equally ready to act! In the first place, Athenians, admit the incontestable fact, that Philip has broken your treaties, -that he has
d,clared war against you.  Let us have no more crimination and
rec:imination on this point! And then, recognize the fact, that he is
the aiortal enemy of Athens, -of its very soil,- of all within its
wall, --ay, of those even who most flatter themselves that they are
high in his good gi a.ces. For, what Philip most dreads and abhors is
our liberty -our Demnocratic system. For the destruction of that,
all his snares are laid, all his projects are shapedl! And in this
is he not consistent? He is well aware that, though he should subjugate all the rest of Greece, his conqulest would be insecure, while
your Democracy stands. He knows that, should he experience on,

of those reverses to which the lot of humanity is so liable, it would
be into your arms that all those Nations, now forcibly held under his
yoke, would. rush.  Is there a Tyrant to be driven back? - Athens is
in i,h e field! Is there a People to be enfranchised? - Lo, Athens,
prompt to aid! What wonder, then, that Philip should be impatient
while Athenian liberty is a spy upon his evil days?  Be sure, 0 my
countrymen, that he is your irreconcilable foe; that it is against Athens that he musters and disposes all his armaments; against Athens
that all his schemes are laid.
What, then, ought you, as wise men, convinced of these truths, to
do?  You ought to shake off your fatal lethargy, contribute according to your means, summon your allies to contribute, and take mncasl
ures to retain the troops' already under arms; so that, if Philip has an
army prepared to attack and subjugate all the Greeks, you may also
have one ready to succor and to save them.    Tell me not of the
trouble and expense which this will involve.  I grant it all.  But
consider the dangers that menace you, and how much you will be the
gainers by engaging heartily, at once, in the generall cause.  Indeed,
should some God assure you that, however inactive and unconcerned
you might remain, yet, in the end, you should not be molested by
Philip, still it would be ignominious, -be witness, HIeaven!-- it
would be beneatl you - beneath the dignity of your State - beneath
the glory of your ancestors - to sacrificel, to your own selfish repose,
the interests of all the rest of Greece. Bather vwould I perish tlhan

he will; and listen to him, if you can.  But, if my sentiHuent,s are

162SENATORIAL. - ESCHlNES
resoures of o,Irage against us?  Without mentioning tne Grecian
cities which he has sacked, does he not take it upon himself to preBide at the Pythian games, a celebration exclusively national?  And,
if absent hi'-elf, does he not delegate his slaves to award the crowns?
Master of Thermopyle, and of all the passes of Greece, does he not
hold these pe,st by his garrisons and foreign troops?  Does he not
place goverrors over Thessaly, at his pleasure?  Has he not wrested
Elchlnus frem the Thebans?  Is he not, at this moment, on his march
afainst Byvsntium - Byzantium, the ally of Athens!   And if such
is his aud, cty towards collective Greece, what will it be when he has
niastered us all in detail?
And s.ow, why is all this?  For, not without a cause could Greece,
onma so jealous of freedom, now be resigned to servitude.  The cause
is h re.  Once, 0 Athenians, in the hearts of all our People, a sentiment presided, which is paramount no more; a sentimnent which triuamphed over Persian gold, and maintained Greece free, and invincible
by laptr and sea; but the loss of that sentiment has brought down
ruin, and left the country in the dust.  What was it - this sentiment, sopowerful?  Was it the result of any subtle policy of State?
No: it was a universal hatred for the bribed traitors, in the pay of
those Powers, seeking to subdue or dishonor Greece! Venality was
a capital offence, and punished with the extremest rigor.  Pardon,
palliation, were not ihought of. And so, orators anld genera ls could
not with impunity barter those favorable conjunctures which Fortune
oftentimes presents to negligence and inactivity, against vig-ilance and
vigor.  The public concord, the general hatred and di.strust of
Tyrants and   Barbarians, all the guarantees of liberty, were inaccessible to the power of gold.  But now all these are cfefercd for sale
in the open rnmarket! And, in exchange, ywe have an inm-portation of
morals which are desolating and destroying Greece.  Wrhat do they
exhibit?  Envy, for the recipient of base bribes; derision, should he
confess his crime; pardon, should he be convicted; and resentment
towards his accuser! -in a word, all the laxities which enuender
corruption.
In vessels, in troops, in revenues, in the various resources of war,
in all that constitu.tes the strength of a State, we are richer than ever
before; but all these advantages are paralyzed, crushed, by an infancmus traffie.  And all this you behold with your own eyes, andc my
testimony in regard to it is quite superfluous

the deserter of his post in battle, is excluded from  all share in the
public deliberations -denied admission to our religious rites, and
rendered incapable of receiving the honor of a crown.  Yet now it is
proposed to crown a man whom your laws expressly disqualify!
Which, think you, was the more worthy citizen, - Thcmist6cles, who
commnanded yotr fleet when you vanquished the Persian at Salamis,
or Demosthenes the dcleserter? - Miltiadles, who conquered the Barbarians at MarAthon, or this hireling traitor? - Aristides, surnamed the
Just, or Demosthenes, who merits a far different surnanme? By all
the Gods of Olympus, it is a profanation to mention in the same breath
this monster and those great men! Let him cite, if he can, one among
them all to iwhonl a crown was decreed.  And was Athens ungrateful?  No! She was magnanimious; and those uncrowned citizens were
worthy of Athens. They placed their glory, not in the letter of a
decree, but in the remembrance of a country, of which they had mer
ited well, - in the living, imperishable reimembrance!
And now a popular orator- the   ainspring of our calamities - a
deserter from the field of battle, a deserter from the city - claims of
us a crown, exacts the honor of a proclamation! Crown hiin?  Proclaim his worth? 3Ty countrymen, this would not be to exalt Demosthe-nes, but to degrade yourselves, - to dishonor those brave men who
perishedl for you in battle.  Crown Ihim!  Shall his recreancy win
what was denied to their devotion?  This would indeed be to insult
the memory of the dead, and to paralyze the emulation of the living!
When Deinosthenes tells you that, as aimbassador, he wrested
Byzantiam from Philip, - that, as orator, he roused the Acarnanians,
and subdued the Thebans, - let not the braggart impose on you.  He
flatters himself that the Athenians are simpletons enough to believe
him, --as if in him they cherished the very genius of persuasion,
instead of a vile calumniator.  But, when, at the close of his defence,
he shall summon to his aidt his accomplices in corrLption, imagine.then,
O Athenians, that you behold, at the foot of this tribune, from  which I

so characteristic, implores you not to pay more regard to the honeyed
phrases of Demosthenes than to your own oaths, your own laws..Aristides, who fixed for Greece the apportionment of her contributions,
and whose orphan daughters were dowered by the Peop'e, is moved to
incdignation at this prostitution of justice, and exclaims:  "Think on
your fathers! Arthmi.us of Zelia brought gold irom iMtedia into greece,
and, for the act, barely escaped deathl in banishment; and now Demost*henes, who has not merely brought gold, but who recedved it as the
price of treachery, and still retains it, - Demosthenes it is unblush

Some authorities state that _schines was born 397 years B. C.; an(l others, that he wvas bnrn

brounght a suit nominally against Cteslphon, but really to crush Demosthenes.  Frolm varionls
causes, the trial was delayed eight years.  At last it came on. The accuser's speech wsas a
great effort. But Demoosthenes was irresistil.le.  " The greatest oration of the greatest of crato,rs," is the phltase which Lord Broughaim applies to the Oratioin on the Crowvn. CtesIphon was
acquitte(d by a considerable majority. AEschlnes went into bainishment at Rlodes, where he
set up a school of rhetoric. IIe once read the oration of Demosthenes to his pupils. Upon
their expressing their admiration of it, he said, " What would you have thought, had you heard
the lion hhnself?1"
LET me begin, Men of Athens, by imploring, of all the Heavenly
Powers, that the same     kindly sentiments which I have, ftlroughout
my public life, cherished towarclds this country and each one of you,
may now by you be shown towards me in the present contest!               In
two respects my adversary plainly has the advantage of me.        First, we
have not the same initerests at stake: it is by no means the same
thing  for me to forfeit your esteem, and for 2Esehines, an unprovoked
volunteer, to fail in his impeachment. My other disadvantage is, the
natural pronenress of men to lend a pleased attention to invective aind
accusation, but to give little heed to  him  whose theme is his own vindication.  To mny adversary, therefore, falls the part which ministers
to your gratification, while to me there is only left that which, I may
almost say, is distasteful to all.  And yet, if I do not speak of myself
and iny own conduct, I shall appear defenceless against his charges,
and without proof that my honors were well earned.         This, therefore,
I must do; but it shall be with moderation.       And bear in mind that
the blame of my   dwelling onr personal topics must justly rest upon him
who has instituted this personal Impeachment.
At least, my Judges, you will admit that this question concerns me
as much as Ctesiphon, anld justifies on my part an equal anxiety.        To
be stripped of anly possession, and more especially by an enemy, is
grievous to bear; but to be robbed of your confidence and       esteem;of all possessions the most precious,-        is indeed  intolerable.  Such,
then, being my stake in this cause, I conjure you all to give ear to
my defence against these     charges, with   that impartiality which    the
laws enjoiin,-     those laws first given by Solon, and which he fixed, not
only by engraving them   oil brazen  tables, but by the sanction    of tlhe
oaths you take when sitting in judgment; because he perceived that,
the accuser being arm    ed  with  the advantage of speaking first, the
accused can have no chance of resisting his charges, unless you, his
Judges, keeping the oath sworn before I-Heaven, shall receive with favcr
the defence which comes last, and, lending an equal ear to both parties,
shall thus make up your minds upon the whole of the case.
But, onr this day, when I am    about to render up     an account, as it
should seem, of my whole life, both public and private, I wouldl(        again

them my supplications,- first, to grant me at your hands the same kind
ness, in this conflict, which I have ever bofine towards our country ana
all of you; and next, that they may incline you all to pronounce upon
this Impeachment the decision which shall best consult the glory of thi
State, and the religious obligations of' each individual Judge!
7. PUBLIC SPIRIT OF ATHENIANS. - Demosthenes on the Crown.
IhE Athenians never were known to live contented in a slavish
though secure obedience to unjust and arbitrary power. No. Our
whole history is a series of gallant contests for preeminence: the
whole period of our national existence hath been spent in braving dalngers, for the sake of glory and renown. And so highly do you esteem
such conduct, as characteristic of the Athenian spirit, that those of
your ancestors who were most eminent for it are ever the most fivorite objects of your praise. And with reason: for, who can reflect,
without astonishment, on the magnanimity of those men who resigned
their lands, gave up their city, and embarked in their ships, rather
than live at the bidding of a stranger? The Athenians of that day
looked out for no speaker, no general, to procure them a state of easy
slavery. They had the spirit to reject even liPe, unless they were
allowed to enjoy that life in freedom.  For it was a principle fixed
deeply in every breast, that man was not born to his parents only, but
to his country. And mark the distinction. He who regards himself
as born only to his parents waits in passive submission for the hour
of his natural dissolution. He who considers that he is the child of
his country, also, volunteers to meet death rather than behold that
country reduced to vassalage; and thinks those insults and disgraces
which he must endure, in a state enslaved, much more terrible than
deatb.
Should I attempt to assert that it was I who inspired you with sentiments worthy of your ancestors, I should meet the just resentment
of every hearer. No: it is my point to show that such sentiments
are properly your own; that they were the sentiments of my country
long before my days. I claim but my share of merit in having acted
on such principles in every part of my administration. He, then, who
condemns every part of my administration, - he who directs you to treat
me with severity, as one who hath involved the state in terrors and dangers,- while he labors to deprive me of present honor, robs you of the
applause of all posterity. For, if you now pronounce, that, as my publie conduct hath not been right, Ctesiphon must stand condemned, it
must be thought that you yourselves have acted wrong, not that you
owe your present state to the caprice of fortune. - But it cannct be!
No, my countrymen, it cannot be that you have acted wrong in
encountering danger bravely for the liberty and. safety of all Greece.
No! I swear it by the spirits of our sires, who rushed upon destruetiun at MIarathon! --by those who stood arrayed at Platxa! - by
166SENATORIAL. - DEMOSTHENES.
those who fought the sea-fight at Salamis!- by the men of Artemisium! --by the others, so many and so brave, who now rest in our
public sepulchres! -all of whom their country judged worthy of the
same honor; all, I say, ~Eschines; not those only who prevailed, not
those only who were victorious. - And with reason. What was the
part of gallant men, they all performed., Their s.access was such as
the supreme Ruler of the world dispensed to each.
8. DEMOSTHENES NOT VANQUISHED BY PHILIP. -Demosthenes on the Cruoiu
Lord Brougham's Translation.
A WICKED thing, Athenians, a wicked thing is a calumniator, ever;
-- querulous and industrious in seeking pretences of complaint. But
this creature is despicable by nature, and incapable of any trace of
generous and noble deeds; ape of a tragedian, third-rate actor, spurious orator!  For what, AEschines, does your eloquence profit the
country?  You now descant upon what is past and gone; as if a
physician, when called to patients' in a sinking state, should give no
advice, nor prescribe any course by which the disease might be cured;
but, after one of them had died, and the last offices were performing
to his remains, should follow him to the grave, and expound how the
poor man never would have died had such and such things only been
done. Moonstricken! is it now that at length you too speak out?
As to the defeat, that incident in which you so exult (wretch! who
should rather mourn for it), - look through my whole conduct, and
you shall find nothing there that brought down this calamity on my
country.  Consider only, Athenians: Never, from any embassy upon
which you sent me, did I conime off worsted by Philip's ambassadors;
not from Thessaly, not fromn Amabracia, not from Illyria, not from the
Thracian kings, not from the Byzantians, nor from any other quarter
whatever, - nor finally, of late, from Thebes. But wheresoever his
negotiators were overcome in debate, thither Philip marched, and
carried the day by his arms. Do you, then, exact this of me; and are
you not ashamed, at the moment you are upbraiding me for weakness,
to require that I should defy him single-handed, and by force of words
alone? For what other weapons had I?  Certainly not the lives of
men, nor the fortune of warriors, nor the military operations of which
you are so blundering as to demand an account at my hands.
But, whatever a minister can be accountable for, make of.hat the
strictest scrutiny, and I do not object. What, then, falls within this
lescription? To descry events in their first beginnings, to cast his
look fborward, and to warn others of their approach. All this I have
done. Then, to confine within the narrowest bounds all delays, and
backwardness, and ignorance, and contentiousness, - faults which are
inherent and unavoidable in all States; and, on the other hand, to promote unanimity, and friendly dispositions, and zeal in the performance;f public duty:--and all these things I likewise did, nor can anr

INTRODUCTORY TREATISE.
I. ORATORY.
ORATORY, which has its derivation from the Latin verb oro, signifying to
plead, to beseech, may be defined the art of producing persuasion ox' conviction by means of spoken discourse. The word eloquence, in its primary signification, as its etymology implies, had a single reference to public speaking
but it is applied by Aristotle, as well as by modern writers, to compositions not
intended for public delivery.  A similar extension of meaning has been
given to the word rhetoric, which, in its etymological sense, means the art of
the orator, but now comprehends the art of prose composition generally.
ORATORY AMONG THE ANCIENTS.
ft is apparent, from the speeches attributed by Homer to the chiefs of the
Iliad, as well as by the commendations whicih he bestows on Nestor and
Ulysses for their eloquence, that the art of Oratory was early understood and
honored in Greece.  But it was not till Demosthenes appeared that Grecian eloquence reached its perfection. Demosthenes, who, by the consent oft
11 antiquity, was the prince of orators, still maintains his preeminence. Of
his style, Hume has happily said: "i It is rapid harmony, exactly adjusted to'the sense; it is vehement reasoning, without any appearance of art; it is
lisdain, anger, boldness, freedom, involved in a continued stream of argument; and of all human productions, the orations of Demosthenes present to
Uis the models which approach the nearest to perfection."  It is related of
this great orator, that, in his first address to the people, he was laughed at
hand interrupted by their clamors. He had a weakness of voice and a stamciering propeensity which rendered it difficult for him to be understood. By
immense labor, and an undauntecl perseverance, he overcame these defects
ind subsequently, by the spell of his eloquence, exercised an unparalleled sway
o,ver that same people who had jeered at him when they first heard him speak
in public. The speeches of Demosthenes were not extemporaneous. There were
no wi-iters of short-hand in his days; and what was written could only come
from the authior himself.
After the time of Demosthenes, Grecian eloquence, which was coeval with
Grecian liberty, declined with the decay of the latter. In Rome, the military
spirit, so incompatible with a high degree of civil freedom, l,ong checked tl~THIE STANDARD SPEAKER,

Undone.
If, then, it should be asked by what means Philip for the most part
succeelded in his operations, every one -wuld answer, By his army, by
his largesses, by corrupting those at un  head of affatirs.  Well, then,
[ neither had armnies, nlor did I command them; and therefore the
Largument respecting military operations cannot touch me.   Nay, in so
far as I was inaccessible to bribes, there I conquered Philip!    For,
as he who purchases any one overcomes him who has received the
price and sold himself, so he who will not take the money, nor consent
to be bribed, has conquered the bidder.      Thus, as far as I am conceerned, this country stands unconquered.
9. CATALINE DENOJNCED. - Cicero.
Cicero, the greatest of Roman orators, was born at Arpinum, 106 B. C., two hundred and six
teen-years after the death of IDemosthenes. Having taken part against Antony, after the assassinatioll of Caosar, Cicero was proscribed. I-e was mnurdered by a party of soldiers, headed by
Popilius l-enas, whose life he had formerly saved by his eloquence; and Ihis head and barnfs
were publicly exhibited on the rostrum at Rome. lie perished in his sixty-fourth year, 13
B. C. Ilis writings are voluminous. As an orator, Cicero ranks next to Demosthenes; and
his orations against Catiline and Yerres are masterpieces of denunciatory eloquence.
Iow far, 0   Catiline, wilt thou abuse our patience?     How long
shalt thou baffle justice in thy mad career? To what extreme wilt
thou carry thy audacity? Art thou nothing daunted by the nightly
watch, posted to secure the Palatiurn?  Nothing, by the city guards2
Nothing, by the rally of all good citizens? Nothing, by the assembling
of the Senate in this fortified place? Nothing, by the averted looks
of; all here present?  Seest thou not that all tlhy plots are exposed i
- that thy wretched conspiracy is laid bare to every man's knowledge,
here in the Senate? -  that we are well aware of thy proceedings of
last night; of the ni,ght before;--  the place of meeting, the company
convoked, the meoasures concerted?     Alas, the times!     Alas, the
public morals!   The Senate understands all this.     The Consul sees
it.  Yet the traitor lives!  Lives    Ay, truly, and confronts us here
in council;,- takes part in oUr' deliberations, - and, with his measuring eye, marks out each man of us for slaughter!       And we, all this
while, strenuous that we are, think we have amply discharged our
dity to the State, if we but shun this madman's sword and fury!
Long since, 0 Catiline, ought the Consul to have ordered thee t,
execution, and brought upon thy own head the -ruin thou hast been
ne-ditating against others!  There was that virtue once in Rome, that
a u-icked citizen was held mnore execrable than the deadliest foe.  We
have a law still, Catiline, for thee.  Think not that we are powerless,
because forbearing.   We have a decree,--though it rests among our
archives like a sword in its scabbard, -a decree, by which thy life
would be made to pay the forfeit of thy crimes.    And, should I ordet
thee to be instantly seized and put to death, I make just doubt whetlher
all good men would not think it done rather too late. than any man
iS8SENATORIAL. - CICERO.
k.:o cruelly  But, for good reasons, I will yet defer the blow long
since deserved, Then will I doom thee, when no man is found, so lost,
so wicked, nay, so like thyself, but shall confess that it was justly
dealt.  While there is one man that dares defend thee, live! But
thou shalt live so beset, so surrounded, so scrutinized, by the vigilant
guards that I have placed around thee, that thou shalt not stir a foot
against the Republic, without my knowledge.   There shall be eye:
to detect thy slightest movement, and ears to catch thy wariest whimper, of which thou shalt not dream.   The darkness of night shall
not cover thy treason  the walls of privacy shall not stifle its voice.
Baffled on all sides, thy most secret counsels clear as noon-day,
what canst thou now have in view? Proceed, plot, conspire, as thou
wilt; there is nothing you can-contrive, nothing you can propose,
nothing you can attempt, which I shall not know, hear and promptly
understand.  Thou shalt soon be made aware that I am even inore
active in providing for the preservation of the State, than thou in
plotting its destruction!
10. CATILINE EXPELLED. - Cicero
AT length, Romans, we are rid of Catiline! We have driven him
forth, drank with fury, breathing mischief, threatening to revisit us
with fire and sword.  He is gone; he is fled; he has escaped; he has
broken away.  No longer, within the very walls of the city, shall he
plot her ruin.  We have forced him from secret plots into open rebellion.  The bad citizen is now the avowed traitor.  His flight is the
confession of.his treason! Would that his attendants had not been
so few!   Be speedy, ye companions of his dissolute pleasures; be
speedy, and you may overtake him before night, on the Aurelian road.
Let him  not languish, deprived of your society. HI-aste to join the
congenial crew that compose his army; his arlmy, I say,- for who
doubts that the army under Manlius expect Catiline for their leader?
And such an army! Outcasts from honor, and fugitives from  debt;
gamblers and felons; miscreants, whose dreams are of rapine, murder
and conflagration!
Against these gallant troops of your adversary, prepare, 0 Romans,

On the one side chastity contends; on the other, wantonness: here
purity, there pollution; here integrity, there treachery; here piety,
there profaneness; here constancy, there rage; here honesty, there
baseness; here continence, there lust; in short, equity, temperance,
fortitude, prudence, struggle with iniquity, luxury, cowardice, rashness; every virtue with every vice; and, lastly, the contest lies between well-grounded hope and absolute despair.  In such a conflict,
were even human aid io fail, would not the immortal Gods empower
such conspicuous virtue to triumph over such complicated vice.

11. VERRES DENOUNCED. - Czcero.
AN opinion has long prevailed, Fathers, that, in paublic prosecutions,
men of wealth, however clearly convicted, are always safe.  This
opinion, so injurious to your order, so detrimental to the State, it is
now in your power to refute. A man is on trial before you who is
rich, and who hopes his riches will compass his acqulittal; but whose
life and actions are his sufficient condemnation in the eyes of' all candid
men.   I speak of Caius Verres, who, if he now receive not the sentence his crimes deserve, it shall not be through the lack of a criminal,
or of a prosecutor; but through the failure of the ministers of justice
to do their duty.  Passing over the shameful irregularities of his
youth, what does the qusestorship of Verres exhibit but one continued
scene of villanies? The public treasure squandered, a Consul stripped
and betrayed, an army deserted and reduced to want, a province robbed,
the civil and religious rights of a People trampled on! But his prsetorship in Sicily has crowned his career of wickedness, and completed
the lasting monument of his infamy. His decisions have violated all
law, all precedent, all right. His extortions from the industrious poor
have been beyond computation.  Our most faithful allies have been
treated as  enemies.  Roman citizens have, like slaves, been put to
death with tortures. Men the most worthy have been condemned and
banished without a hearing, while the most atrocious criminals have,
with money, purchased exemption from  the punishment due to their
guilt.
I ask now, 1erres, what have you to advance against these charges?
Art thou not the tyrant pr'tor, who, at no greater distance than Sicily,
within sight of the Italian coast, dared to put to an infamous death,
on the cross, that ill-fited and innocent citizen, Publius Gavius Cosanus? And what was his offence?   He had declared his intention
of appealing to the justice of his country against your brutal persecutions!  For this, when about to embark for homie, he was seized,
brought before you, charged with being a spy, scourged and tortured.
In vain did he exclaim: " I am a Rornan citizen! I have served
under Lucius PretTus, who is now at Panormus, and who will attest
my innocence!    Deaf to all remonstrance, remorseless, thirsting for
innocent blood, you ordered the savagfe punishmlent to be inflicted!,h%ile the sacred woirds, " I am a Roman citizen,:' were on his lips, -
words which, in the remotest regions, are a passport to protection, -
yot ordered him to death, to a death upon the cross!
0  liberty!  0 sound once delightful to every Roman ear!  0
sacred privilege of Roman citizenship! once sacred, --now trampled
on!  Is it come to this?  Shall an inferior magistrate, a governor,
who holds his whole power of the Roman People, in a Roman province, within sight of Italy, bind, scourge, torture, and put to an infamous death, a Roman citizen? Shall neither the cries of innocence
expiring in agony, the tears of pitying spectators, the majesty of the
Roman Commonwealth, nor the fear of the justice of his country.

strangle justice, and call down anarchy, massacre and ruin, on the

12. AGAINST THE NOBILITY AND CLERGY OF PROVENCE, FEB. 3, 1789. -
Original Translation from Mirabeau.
Honor Gabriel Riquetti, Comte de Mirabeau, was born at Bignon, in France, on the 9th of
~Iarch, 1749. The early part of his life was one of disorder and misery. The French Revolution offered a field for his energies. Being rejected, at the time of the elections, by the nobility of Provence, he hired a warehouse, put up this inscription,--" Mirabeau, woollen-draper,"and was elected deputy from the third estate of Aix. His contemporaries speak of the effect
of his eloquence as surprising and irresistible.  " He trod the tribune with the supreme author
ity of a master, and the imperial air of a king." Personally, he was quite ugly. He himself
has said, in a letter to a lady who had not seen him:-" Imagine a tiger scarred with the small
pox, and you may form some notion of my features." " IIe was a man," says one of his crit
ics, " who, by his qualities no less than by the singularity of his fortune, is destined to take
his place in history by the side of the Demosthenres, the Gracchi, and the other kindred spirits
of an antiquity whose gigantic characteristics he so frequently reproduced." He died 1791.
In the French National Assembly, every speaker who addresses that body formally, instead
of speaking from his seat, as in the legislative halls of England and the United States, ascends
an elevated platform, or pulpit, called a tribune, from which he makes his harangue.
IN all countries, in all ages, have aristocrats implacably pursued the
friends of the People; and when, by I know not what combination of
fortune, such a friend has uprisen from    the very bosom of the aristoerapy, it has been at him preeminently that they have struck, eager to
inspire wider terror by the elevation of their victim. So perished the
last of the Gracchi by the hands of the Patricians. But, mortally
smitten, he flung dust towards Heaven, calling the avenging Gods to
witness: and, from that dust, sprang Marius;- Marius, less illustrious for having exterminated the Cimbri than for having beaten down
the despotism of the nobility in Rome.
But you, Commons, listen to one, who, unseduced by your applauses,
yet cherishes them in his heart. Man is strong only by union; happy
only by peace. Be firm, not obstinate; courageous, not turbulent;
free, not undisciplined; prompt, not precipitate. Stop not except at
difficulties of moment; and be then wholly inflexible. But disdain the
contentions of self-love, and never thrust into the balance the individ
ual against the country. Above all, hasten, as much as in you lies
the epoch of those States-General, from which you are charged witb
flinching, - the more acrimoniously charged, the more your accusers
dread the results; of those States-General, through which so many
pretensions will be scattered, so many rights re&amp;stablished, so many
evils reformed; of those States-General, in short, through which thf
monarch  him self desires that France should regenerate herself.
For myself, who, in my public career, have had no other fear but
that of wrong-doing, -who, girt with my conscience, and armed with
my principles, would brave the universe, - whether it shall be my for
tune to serve you with my voice and my exertions in tbhe National

injurious protestations,-  all the convulsions, in a word, of expiring

his civic course, who, first among all the men of France, emlphatically
proclaimed his opinions on national affairs, at a time when circumstances
were much less urgent than now, and the task one of much greatei
peril? Never! No measure of outrages shall bear down my patience.
I have been, I am, I shall be, even to the tomb, the man of the
Public Liberty, the man of the Constitution. If to be such be to
become the man of the People rather than of the Nobles, then woo
to the privileged orders!  For privileges shall have an end, but the
People is eternal!
13. NECKER'S FINANCIAL PLAN, SEPT. 26, 1789.--AMirabeau. Orig. Translatzon.
Necker, the minister of finance, having proposed an income tax of twenty-five per cent., with
other measures, in view of the desperate state of the financial affairs of France, the proposition
was advocated by Mirabeau, who did not, however, profess to comprehend or en(lorse all its
details. Although a known enemy to the minister, he magnanimously made two speeches in
behalf of his measure; without, however, inducing the Assembly to pass it, until, on the eve
of its being rejected, Mirabeau rushed to the Tribune, and poured forth a last appeal, an abridgment of which is here given. This speech proved effectual.'rhe Assembly received it with
shouts of enthusiasm; and Neoker's plan was adopted. Madame de Stael (Necker's daughter),
who was near Mirabeau at the time of the delivery of this speech, says that "its effect was
prodigious."
THEe minister of finance has presented a most alarming picture of'
the state of our affairs.  He has assured us that delay must aggravate
tho peril; and that a day, an hour, an instant, may render it fatal.
WVe have no plan that can be substituted for that which he proposes.
On this plan, therefore, we must fall back.   But, have we time, Gentlemen ask, to examine it, to probe it thoroughly, and verify its calculations?  No, no! a thousand times no         Hap-hazard conjectures,
insignificant inquiries, gropings that can but mislead, - these are all
that we can give to it now.     Shall we therefore miss the decisive
moment?     Do Gentlemen hope to escape sacrifices and taxation by a
plunge into national bankruptcy?   What, then, is bankruptcy, but the
most cruel, the most iniquitous, most unequal and disastrous of imlposts?
Listen to me for one moment!
Two centuries of plunder and abuse have dug the abyss which
threatens to engulf the Nation.     It must be filled up -  this terrible
chasm.   But how?    Here is a list of proprietors.  Choose from   the
wealthiest, in order that the smallest number of citizens may be sacrificed.  But choose!     Shall not a few perish, that the mass of the
People may be saved?     Come, then!    Here are two thousand Notables, whose property will supply the deficit.    Restore order to your
finances, peace and prosperity to the Kingdom!     Strike!   Immolate,
without mercy, these unfortunate victims! Hurl them into the abyss.

You recoil with dismay from the contemplation.      Inconsistent and
pusillanimous! What! Do you not perceive that, in decreeing a

upon France; impenetrable egotists, who fancy that these convulsions
of despair and of misery will pass, as other calamities have passed,
and all the more rapidly because of their intense violence, - are you,
indeed, certain that so many men without bread will leave you tranquilly to the enjoyment of those savory viands, the number and delicacy of which you are so loth to diminish?  No! you wvill perish;
and, in the universal conflagration, which you do not shrink from kindling, you will not, in losing your honor, save a single one of your
detestable indulgences.  This is the way we are going.  And I say
to you, that the men who, above all others, are interested in the
enforcement of these sacrifices which the Government deminads, are
you yourselves! Vote, then, this subsidy extraordinary; and may it
prove sufficient!  \Vote it, inasmuch as whatever doubts you may
entertain as to the means, - doubts vague and unenlightened, -you
can have none as to the necessity, or as to our inability to provide -

accords it never.  Why, Gentlemen, it was but the other day, that, in
reference to a ridiculous commotion at the Palais-Royal,*--  a Quixotic
insurrection, which never had any importance save in the feeble imaginations or perverse designs of certain faithless men,--you heard these
wild words: " Catiline is at the gates of Rome, and yet you deliberate!"   And verily there was neither a Catiline nor a Rome;
neither perils nor factions around you.  But, to-day, bankruptcy,
hideous bankruptcy, is there before you, and threatens to consume you,
yourselves, your property, your honor, - and yet you deliberate!

declared to you, that their conscience and their honor forbade their
obedience to your laws, - I said to miyself, Are these, then, dethroned
sovereigns, who, in a transport of imprudent but generous pride, are
addressing successful usurpers?  No; these are men, whose arrogant
pretensions have too long been an insult to all ideas of social order;
champions, even more interested than audacious, of a system which
has cost France centuries of oppression, public and private, political
Pand fiscal, feudal and judicial, - and whose hope is to make us regret
and revive that system. The people of Brittainy have sent among you
sixty-six representatives, who assure you that the new Constitution
crowns all their wishes;- and here come eleven Judges of the Provint:e, who cannot consent that you should be the benefactors of their
country.  They have disobeyed your laws; and they pride themselves
on their disobedience, and believe it will make their names honored by
posterity.  No, Gentlemen, the rememibrance of their folly will not
pass to posterity. AWhat avail their pigmy efforts to brace themselves
against the progress of a Revolution the grandest and most glorious
in the world's history, and one that must infallibly change the face of
the globe and the lot of humanity?  Strange presumption, that would
arrest liberty in its course, and roll back the destinies of a great
Nation  
It i noot to antiquated traBnsactions, - it is not to musty treaties,
wherein fraud combined with force to chain men to the car of certain
haughty masters,--that the National Assembly have resorted, in their
investigations into popular rights. The titles we offer are more imposing by far; ancient as time, sacred and i mprescriptible as Nature!

the perpetuity of that feudal scourge, which unhappily has lasted only

Commissioned to form  a Constitution for France, I will not ask
whether, with that authority, we did not receive also the power to do
all that was necessary to complete, establish, and confirm that Constitution.  I will not ask, ought we to have lost in pusillan;imous consult
ations the time of action, while nascent Liberty would have received
her death-blow?  But if Gentlemen insist on demanding when and
how, fiom simple deputies of bailiwicks, we became all at once transformed into a National Convention, I reply, It was on that day, when,
findinzg the hall where we were to assemble closed, and bristling alndc
polluted with bayonets, we resorted to the first place where we could
reunite, to swear to perish rather than submit to such an order of
things! That day, if we were not a National Convention, we became
one; became one for the destruction of arbitrary power, and for the
defence of tlhe rights of thle Nation from all violence.  The strivings
of Despotism  which we have quelled, the perils which we have
averted, the violence which we have repressed, - these are our titles!
Our successes have consecrated them; the adhesion, so often renewed,
of all parts of the Empire, has legitimized and sanctified them.  Suminoned to its task by the irresistible tocsin of necessity, our National
Convention is above all imitation, as it is above all authority.  It is
accountable only to itself, and can be judged only by posterity.
Gentlemen, you all remember the instance of that Roman, who, to
save his country from a dangerous conspiracy, had been constrained to
-overstep the powers conferred on him by the laws. A captious Tribline exacted of him the oath that he had respected those laws; hoping,
by this insidious demand, to drive the Consul to the alternative of perjury or oF an embarrassing avowal.   "Swear," said the Tribune,
"' that you have observed the laws."  "I swear," replied the great
man-, --  I swear that I have saved the Republic."  Gentlemen, I

FRANKLIN is dead! iRestored to the bosom of the Divinity ia that
genius which gave freedom to America, and rayed forth torrentU of
light upon Europe. The sage whom two worlds claim- the man
whomn the History of Empires and the History of Science alike contend
fbr--occupied, it cannot be denied, a lofty rank among his species.
Long enouglh have political Cabinets signalized the death of those who
were great in their funeral eulogies only.  Long enough has the
etiquette of Courts prescribed hypocritical mournings.  For their benefactors only, should Nations assume the emblemns of grief; and the
Representatives of Nations should commend only the heroes of humanity to public veneration.
In the fourteen States of the Confederacy, Congress has ordained a
mourning of two months for the death of Franklin; and America is
at this morent acquitting herself of this tribute of honor to one of the
Fathers of her Constitution.  Would it not become us, Gentlemen, to
tnite in this religious act; to participate in this homage, publicly rendered, at once to the rights of man, and to the philosopher who has
contributed most largely to their vindication throughout the world?
Anatiquity would have erected altars to this great and powerful genius,
who, to promote the wellfare of mankind, comprehending both the
Hleaveis and the Earth in the range of his thought, could at once snatch
the bolt from  the cloud and the sceptre from  tyrants.  Filance,
enlightened and free, owes at least the acknowledgment of her remembrance and regret to one of the greatest intellects that ever served the
united cause of philosophy and liberty. I propose that it be now
decreed that the National Assembly wear mourning, during three
days, for Benjamin Franklin.
18. TIlE UNION OF CHURCH AND STATE. --Original Translation from Mirabeau
WE are reproached with having refused to decree that the CatholiC religion, Apostolic and Roman, is the national religion.  To
declare the Christian religion national, would be to dishonor it in its
most intimate and essential characteristic.  In general terms, it may
be said, that religion is not, and cannot be, a relation between the
individual man and society. It is a relation between him and the Infinite Being.  Would you understand what wa's meant by a, national
conscience?  Religion is no mlore national than conscience! A man
is noi; veritably religious in so far as he is attached to the religion of
ITNation.  If there were but one religion in the world, and all men
wvere agreed in professing it, it would be none the less true that each
wxould have the sincere sentiment of religion so far only as he should
be hims,elf religious with a religion of his own; that is to say, so far
only as he would be wedded to that universal religion, even though
the wrhole human race werie to abjlure it.  And so, from whatever
point we consider religion, to term it nzational is to give it a designam

12THE STAY,DARD SPEAKER.
growth of that popular intelligence which is the only element in which the
noblest eloquence is nurtured. Rhetoricians were banished from the country
as late as the year of the city 592. A few years subsequent to this period,
the study of Oratory was introduced from Athens; and it at length found a
zealous disciple and a consummate master in Cicero, whose fame is second
only to that of his Athenian predecessor. The main causes to which the
extraordinary perfection of ancient Oratory is to be ascribed are the great
pains bestowed on the education of the young in this most difficult art, and
the practice among speakers of preparing nearly all their finest orations
hefore delivery.
MODERN ORATORY
In modern times, Oratory has not been cultivated with so much care as.mong the ancients. The diffusion of opinions and arguments by means of
the Press has, perhaps, contributed in some degree to its neglect. A speaker
is now mainly known to the public through the Press, and it is often more
important to him to be read than heard. Still, the power of Oratory in republican countries must always be immense, and the importance of its cultivation
must be proportionate. We see it flourishl or decay according to the degree
of freedom among the people, and it is a bad sign for a republic when Oratory
is slighted or undervalued. It was not till France began to throw off the
trammels of her monarchical system, that ehe produced a MIirabeau. Her
parliamentary annals will show that the eloquence of her National Assembly
has been in proportion to the predominance of the element of constitutional
freedom in her government.
The struggle against incipient despotism in England, which resulted in the
execution of King Charles the First, was productive of some great bursts of
eloquence from Vane, Pym, Eliot, and othler champions of popular rights;
whose speeches, however, have been strangely slighted by the majority of
English critics. The latter part of the eighteenth century was illumined by the
genius of Chatham, Pitt, Burke, Fox, Sheridan, and Grattan; all of whom
were roused to some of their most brilliant efforts by the arbitrary course of
government towards our ancestors of the American colonies. Ireland is well
represented in this immortal list. Her sons have ever displayed a true genius
for Oratory.
The little opportunity afforded for the cultivation of forensic or senatorial
eloquence by the different governments of Germany has aliost entirely
checked its growth in that country; and we may say the same of Italy, Spain
and Portugal, and most of the other countries of Europe. To the pulpit
Oratory of France, the illustrious names of Bossuet, Bourdaloue and Massillon,
have given enduring celebrity; and in forensic and senatorial eloquence,
France has not been surpassed by any modern nation. But it is only in her
intervals of freedom that her senatorial eloquence reaches its high note.
The growth of eloquence in the United States has been such as to inspire the'hope that the highest triumphs of Oratory are here to be achieved, Already
we have produced at least two orators, Patrick Henry and Daniel Webster, to
horn none, since Demosthenes, in the authority, majesty and amplitude, of
kaeir eloquence, can be pronounced superior. In proportion to the extent of
our cultivation of Oratory as an art worthy our entire devotion, must be oul
success in enriching it with new and precious contributions. And of the
pr wer of a noble Oratory, beyond its immediate circle of hearers, who can
doubt? " Who doubts?" asks Mr. Webster, " that, in our own struggle for
freedom and independence, the majestic eloquence of Chatham, the profound
reasoning of Burke, the burning satire and irony of Barre, had influence on
our fortunes in America? They tended to diminish the confidence of ithe
British ministry in their hopes to subject us. There was not a reading man
who did not struggle more boldly for his rights when those exhilarating

thought and conscience men remain isolated; and their associatlca
leaves to them, in these respects, the absolute freedom  of the state
of nature.
What a spectacle would it be for those early Christians, who, to
escape the sword of Persecution, were obliged to consecrate their altars
in caves or amid ruins, - what a spectacle would it be for them, could
they this day come among us, and witness the glory with which their
despised religion now sees itself environed; the temples, the lofty
steeples bearing aloft the glittering emblem of their faiith; the evangelic cross, which crowns the summit of all the departments of this
great Empire!       What a transporting    sight for those who, in

Methinks I hear them exclaim, even as that stranger of the old time
exclaimed, on beholding the encampment of the People of God," HEOW GOODLY ARE TIIY TENTS, 0 JACOB, AND TiY TABERNACLES,
O ISRAEL! "    Calm, then, ah! calm your apprehensions, ye ministers
of the God of peace and truth     Blush rather at your incendiary
exaggerations, and no longer look at the action of this Assembly
through the mediumn of your passions.   We do not ask it of you to
take an oath contrary to the law of your heart; but we do ask it of
you, in the name of that God who will judge us all, not to confound
human opinions and scholastic traditions with the sacred and inviolab'le
rules of the Gospel.   If it be contrary to morality to act against
one's conscience, it is none the less so to form one's conscience after
false and arbitrary principles.  The obligation to fo,~?n and enlighten
one's conscience is anterior to the obligation to follow one's conscience.
The greatest public calamities have been caused by men who believed
they were obeying God, and saving their own souls.
19. TO THE FRENCHI PEOPLE, 1792.--Original Translation from Vergniaucd
Vergniaud, the most eloquent orator of the celebrated party known as the Girondists, during
the French Revolution, was born at Limoges, in 1759. He was executed in 1.793. As an
rator, his renown is second only to that of Mirabeau, in France. His speeches were alwaryei
carefully prepared beforehand.
PREPARATIONS for war are manifest on our frontiers; and we hear
of renewed plots against liber-ty.  Our armies re:issenmble; mighty
movements agitate the Empire.    Martial law having become neo;es.

of Germany make their territory a retreat for the conspirators against
you. They favor the plots of the emigrants. They furnish them an
as min- they furnish them gold, arms, horses, and munitions.  Is
not the patience suicidal which tolerates all this?  Doubtless you
have renounced all projects of conquest; but you have not promised to
endure such insolent provocations.  You have shaken off the yoke of
your tyrants; but it was not to bend the knee to foreign despots.
But, beware! You are environed by snares. They seek to draive
you, by disgust or lassitude, to a state of languor fatal to your
courage, - or fatal to its right direction. They seelc to separate you
from us; they pursue a system of calumny against the National
Assembly; they incriminate your Revolution in your eyes. 0!
beware of these attempts at panic! Repel, indignantly, these impostors,'who, while they affect a hypocritical zeal for the Constitution,
cease not to urge upon you the monarcly! The monarchy! With
them  it is the counter-revolution!  The monarchy?   It is the
nobility! The counter-revolution - what is it but taxation, feudality,
the Bastille, chains and executioners, to punish the sublime aspirations
of liberty?  What is it but foreign satellites in the midst of the
State? What, but bankruptcy, engulfing, with your assignats, your
private fortunes and the national wealth; what, but the furies of
fanaticism, and of vengeance, -assassinations, pillage, and incendiarism,  in short, despotism and death, disputing, over rivers of
blood and heaps of carcasses, the dominion of your wretched country.?
The nobility!  That is to say, two classes of men; the one fom
grandeur, the other for debasement!-the one for tyranny, the othei
for servitude! The nobility! Ah! the very word is an insult te
the human race!
And yet, it is in order to secure the success of these conspiracies
that Europe is now put in motion against you! Be it so! By a
solemn declaration must these guilty hopes be crushed.  Yes, the
free representatives of France, unshaken in their attachment to the
Constitution, will be buried beneath its ruins, before they consent to a
c.apitulation at once unworthy of them and of you.  Rally! Be
reassured! They would raise the Nations against you: -they will
raise only princes. The heart of every People is with you. It is
their cause which you embrace, in defending your own. Ever
abhorred be war! It is the greatest of the crimes of men; - it is
th3 most terrible scourge of humanity! But, since you are irresistibly
fblced to it, yield to the course of your destinies.  Who can foresee
where will end the punishment of the tyrants who will have driven
you to take up arms?

22. MORALITY THE BASIS OF CIVILIZED SOCIETY--BELIEF IN GOD THE BASIS
OF MORALITY. - Robespierre. Ori,inal Translation.
The name of Maximilien Robespierre is associated with all that is sanguinary and atrocious
in the history of the French Revolution. Whatever his own practice may have been, he had
the sagacity to see that there is no security in a Republic which is not based on principle,and no seceuityin principle which is not based on belief in God and the immortality of the soul.
The extract we here give is froml his Report, read to the French National Convention, the Tth
of May, 1794.
TIIE idea of a Supreme Being and of the immortality of the soul is
a continual call to justice.  It is therefore a social and republican
principle.  Who has authorized you to declare that a Deity does not
exist?  0, you who support so arid a doctrine, what advantage do
you expect' to derive from the principle that a blind fatality regulates
the affairs of men, and that the soul is nothing but a breath of air
impelled towards the tomb?   Will the idea of nonentity inspire man
with more tevated sentiments than that of immortality?      Will it
awaken more respect for others or himself, more' devotion to country
more courage to resist tyranny, greater contempt fo-r pleasure or

death?   You, who regret a virtuous friend, can you endure the
ehought that h'. noblest part has not escaped dissolution.?     You. who
weep over the remains of a child or a wife, are you consoled by the
thought that a handful of dust is all that is left of the beloved object 2
You, the unfortunate, who expire under the stroke of the assassin, is
not your last sigh an appeal to the justice of the Most High?      Innocence on the scaffold makes the tyrant turn pale oni his triumphal car.
WVould such an ascendency be felt, if the tomb levelled alike the oppressor and the oppressed?   The more a man is gifted with sensibility
and genius, the more does he attach himself to those ideas which
aggrandize his being and exalt his aspirations; and the doctrine of
men of this stamp becomes the doctrine of all mankind.      A great man,
a veritable hero, knows his own worth too well to experience complacency in the thought of his nonentity. A wretch, despicable in his own
eyes, repulsive in those of others, feels that nature but gives him his
deserts in annihilation.
Confusion to those who seek, by their desolating doctrines, to extinguish this sublime enthusiasm, and to stifle this moral instinct of the
People, which is the principle of all great actions!      To you, Representatives of the People, it belongs to hasten the triumph of the truths
we have developed. If we lack the courage to proclaim them, then
deep, indeed, must be the depravity, with which we are environed!
Defy the insensate clamors of presumptuous igniorance and of stuLbborn
hypocrisy!   Will posterity credit it, that the vanquished factions have
carried their audacity so far as to charge us with lukewarmness and
aristocracy for having restored to the Nation's heart the idea of the
Divinity, the fundamental principle of all morality?           Will it be
believed that they have dared, even in this place, to assert that we
have thereby thrown back human reason centuries in its progress?
O, be not surprised that the wretches, leagued against us, are so
eager to put the hemlock     to our lips!    But, before we quaff it, we
will save the country!
23. ROBESPIERRE'S LAST SPEECI. -Original Translation.
The day after this speech, - delivered July 28th, 1794, and addressed to an assembly bent 0i
his destruction,-Robespierre was executed, at the early age of thirty-five, under circumstances
of accumnulated horror. Ilis fate is a warning to rulers who would cement even the best of
Governments with blood. Robespierre's character is still an enigma; some regarding him as
an honest fan3tic% and others as a crafty demagogue. Perhaps the traits of either predominated at times. " Destitute," says Lamartine, "of exterior graces, and of that gift of extempo
raneous speaking which pours forth the unpremeditated inspirations of natural eloquence, Robespierre had taken so much pains *vith himself, - he had meditated so much, written and erased
so much, -he had so often braved the inattention aild the sarcasms of his audiences, - that, in
the end, he succeeded in giving warmth and suppleness to his style, and in transforming his
whole person, despite his stiff and meagre figure, his shrill voice and abrupt gesticulation, into
an engine of eloquence, of conviction and of passion."
THE, enemies of the Republic call me tyrant! Were I such they
would grovel at my feet.    I should gorge them    with gold,-   I should
grant them impunity for their crimes,-     and they would be grateful.

Ribcspierre, would lend me their guilty support.       There would be a

ecvenant between th6m and me. Tyranny must have tools,  But the
enemies of tyranny, - whither does their path tend? To the tomb,
and to immortality! What tyrant is my protector? To what faction
do I belong? Yourselves! What faction, since the beginning of the
Revolution, has crushed and annihilated so many detected traitors?
You, - the People, - our principles, - are that faction! A faction
to which I am devoted, and against which all the scoundrelism of the
day is banded!
The confirmation of the Republic has been my object; and I know
that the Republic can be established only on the eternal basis of
morality. Against me, and against those who hold kiindred principles,
the league is formed.  My life?  O! my life, I abandon without a
regret! I have seen the Past; AND I FORESEE THE FUTURE. What
friend of his country would wish to survive the moment when he could
no longer serve it,- when he could no longer defend innocence against
oppression?  Wherefore should I continue in an order of things,
where intrigue eternally triumphs over truth; where justice is
mocked; where passions the most abject, or fears the most absurd,
override the sacred interests of humanity? In witnessing the multitude of vices which the torrent of the Revolution has rolled in turbid
communion with its civic virtues, I confess that I have sometimes
feared that I should be sullied, in the eyes of posterity, by the impure
neighborhood of unprincipled men, who had thrust themselves into
association with the sincere friends of humanity; and I rejoice that
these conspirators against my country have now, by their reckless
rage, traced deep the line of demarcationi between themselves and all
true men.
Question history, and learn how all the defenders of liberty, in all
times, have been overwhelmed by calumny.  But their traducers died
also. The good and the bad disappear alike from the earth; but in
very different conditions.  O, Frenchmen! 0, my countrymen! Let
not your enemies, with their desolating doctrines, degrade your souls,
and enervate your virtues! No, Chaumette,* no! Death is not " an
eternal sleep "!  Citizens! efface from the tomb that motto, graven by
acrilegious hands, which spreads over all nature a funereal crape, takes
from oppressed innocence its support, and affronts the beneficent dclispensation of death! Inscribe rather thereon these words: " Death is theo
commencement of inlmortality!"   I leave to the oppressors of the
People a terrible testament;,which I proclaim with the independenee
befitting one whose career is so nearly ended; it is the awful truth, -' Thou shalt die!"
24. ADDRESS TO IHE CHAMBER OF PEERS, 1835.--Trrlat.
I HAVE long felt that it was necessary - that it was inevitablec
-we should meet face to fatce: we do so now. Gentlemen Peets,
p Chaumette was % member of the Convention, who Was opposed to the publio
recognition of a God 7x=a a future state.
183THE STANDARD SPEAKERcur mutual eniityis not the birth of yesterday. In: 1814, in common
withl n..ny, many others, I cursed the power which called you or
yoiur predlecessors to help it in chaining down liberty. In 1815 1
took up arms to oppose the return of your gracious master of that day.
Tn 1830 I did iy duty in promoting the successful issue of the event
which then occurred; and eiglht days after the Revolution, I again
took up my musket, though but little in the habit of handling warlike,
instruments, and went to the post which General Lafayette had as.
signed us for the purpose of marching against you personally, Gentle.
men Peers! It was in the presence of my friends and myself that
one of your number was received; and it is not impossible that we had
some influence in occasioning the very limited success of his embassy.
It was then hIe who appeared before us, imploring, beseeching, with
tears in his eyes; it is now our turn to appear before you,-but we do
po without imploring, or beseeching, or weeping, or bending the knee.
We had utterly vanquished your Kings; and, they being gone, you
had nothing left.  As. for you, you have not vanquished the People;
and whether you hold us as hostages for it or not, our personal
position troubles us very, very little;-rely upon that.
Your prisons open to receive within their dungeons all who retain
a free heart in their bosoms. He who first placed the tri-colored fag
on the palace of your old Kings - they who drove Charles the Tenth
from France - are handed over to you as victims, on account of your
new  King. Your sergeant has touched with his black wand the,courageous deputy who first, among you all, opened his door to the
Revolution. The whole thing is summed up in these facts: It is the
Revolution struggling with the counter-revolution; the Past with the
Present, with the Futuree; selfishness witll fraternity; tyranny with
liberty.  Tyranny has on her side'bayonets, prisons, and -your
embroidered collars, Gentlemen Peers. Liberty has God on her side,
- the Power which enlightens the reason of man, and impels him
forward in the great work of human advancement. It will be seen
with whom victory will abide. This will be seen, - not to-morrow, not
the day after to-morrow, nor the day after that, - it may not be seen
by us at all;-- what matters that?  It is the human. race which
engages our thoughts, and not ourselves. Everything manifests that
the hour of deliverance is not far distant. It will then be seen
whether God will permit the lie to be given Him with impunity.
Gentlemen Peers, I did not staind up with the purpose of defending
myseplf. You are my political enemies, not my judges. In a fair
trial, it is necessary that the judge and the accused should understand,
--should, to a certain extent, sympathize with each other.  In the
present case, this is quite out of the question. We do not feel alike
we do not speak the same language. The land we inhabit, humanit)
itself, its laws, its requirements, duty, religion, the sciences, the arts,
in(lustry, all that constitutes society, - Heaven, earth, - nothing appeairs
to us in the same light that it does to you. There is a world between
us. Youi may condemn me; but I accept you not as judges, for vou,ire unable to comprehend me.
184SENATORIAL. -- DE TOCQUEVILLE.
25. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE REPUBLIC, 1548. - Lamartine.
WE establish the Republic.  The Republic! It is the Government
that most needs the continued inspiration and benediction of God; for,
of the reason of the People should be obscured or misledl, there is no.snger a sovereign.  There is an interregnum, ana rchy, death.  In
ordei that a Governmient may be durable, and worthy of' the sanction
of religion, it must contain a principle that is true, that is divine, that
is best adapted to the welfare of the many.  Without this, the Con'
stitution is a dead letter; it is nothing more than a collection of' laws;
it is without soul; it no longer lives; it no longer produces fiuit. The
new principle of the Republic is political equality among all classes of
citizens.  This principle has for its exponent ulniverlsal suffrage; for
its result, the sovereignty of all; for its imoral consequence, friaternity
among all.  We reign according to the full measure of' our reason, of
our intelligence, of our virtue.  We are all sovereigns eover ourselves,
and of the Republic.  But, to draught a Constitution, and to swear to
it, is not all.  A People is needed to execute it.
Citizens I all progress requires effort.  Every effort is painful, and
attended with painful embarrassments.  Political transfbrmations are
laborious.  The People are the artificers of their own futulre.  Let
them reflect upon that. The future observes and awaits them! Shame
upon the cowards who would draw back! Prudence to the inconsiderate, who would precipitate society into the unknown! Glory to the
good, to the wise, to the persevering! -may God be with them!  
26. DEMOCRACY ADVERSE TO SOCIALISMI.-Alexis De Tocqueville.' Orig. Trans
DEMOCRACY! - Socialism! Why profess to associate what, in the'
nature of things, can never be united?  Can it be, Gentlemlen, that,
this whole grand movement of the French Revolution is destined to
terminate in that form ofe society which the Socialists have, with so
much fervor, depicted?  A society, marked out with compass and
rule; in which the State is to charge itself with everything, and the
individual is to be notlling; in which society is to absorb all force, all
life; and in which the only end assigned to man is his personal comfort' What! was it for such a society of beavers and of bees, a society
rather of skilful animals than of men f'ree and civilized,- was it for
such, that the French Revolution was accomplished?  Not so! It
was for a greater, a more sacred end; one more worthy of humanity.
But Socialism professes to be the legitinmate development of Democracy. I shall not search, as many have done, into the true etymology
of this word Democracy.   I shall not, as gentlemen did yesterday,
traverse the garden of Greek roots, to find the derivation of this word
I shall point you to Democracy, where I have seen it, living, active
triumphant; in the only country in the world where it truly exists,
wvhere it has been able to establish and maintain, even to the present
time, something grand and durable to claim our admniration, - in the
185TIE 8, ARNiDARD SPEARKEIt.
New World, - in America,--There shall you see a People, among'whom all conditions of men are more on an equality even than among
ns; where the social state, the manners, the laws, - everything is
democratic; where all emanates from the People, and returns to the
People; and where, at the same time, every individual enjoys a grea+er
amount of liberty, a more entire independence, than in any other part
of the world, at any period of time; -a country, I repeat it, essentially
Democratic; the only Democracy in the wide world at this day; and
the only Republic, truly Democratic, which we know of in history.
And in this Republic you will look in vain for Socialism.  Not only
have the theories of the Socialists gained no possession there of the
public mind, but they have played so trifling a part in the discussions
and affairs of that great Nation, that they have not even reached the
dignity of beinig feared.
America is at this day that country, of the whole world, where the
sovereignty of Democracy is most practical and complete; and it is at
the same time that where the doctrines of the Socialists, which you
pretend to find so much in accordance with Democracy, are the least
in vogue; the country, of the whole universe, where the men sustaining those doctrines would have the least chance of making an imlpression. For myself.personally, I do not see, I confess, any great objection to the emigraticn of these proselyting gentlemen to America; but
I warn them that they will not find there any field for their labors.
No, Gentlemen, Demnocracy and Socialism are the antip6des of each
other. While Democracy extends the sphere of individual independence, Socialism  contracts it.  Democracy develops a man's whole
mlanhood, Socialism makes him an agent, an instrument, a cipher.
Democracy and Socialisni assimilate on one point only, - the equality
which they introduce; but mark the difference: Democracy seeks
equality in liberty, while Socialism seeks it in servitude and constraint.
27. PRACTICAL IRELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION.- Or iginal Translation from Victor Hugo.
TI-IE question is, shall we confide the public education of youth to a
cleiical party, independent of the State, - or to the State, inclependent
of a clerical party.  Free instruction --but free instruction under
the superintendence of the State, and not of a sect - is what I would
see. It is not to the clerical party that I would intrust it.  To that
pa. ty I now address myself, and I say: In the proposition before the
National Assembly, we see your hand; and, to be candid, we distrust
you. The proposed law is a law with a mask.  Under the disguise
of liberty, it aims at subjection. But think not that I confound your
doctrines, your ambitions, your intrigues, - think not that I confound
you, the clerical party, - with the Church, any more than I confound
the mistletoe with the oak.  You are the parasites of the Church, -
the disease of the Church. Call her not your mother, when you would
make her your slave. Leave her, this venerable Church, this v nnera186ble mother, to her solitude, her abnegation, her humility. All these
compose her grandeur.    Her solitude will attract the crowd, her
abnegation is her power; her humility is her majesty.
You speak of religious instruction.  Know you what it is, - that
veritable religious instruction, which must ever command our homage
without awakening our distrust?  It is the Sister of Charity at the
pillow of the dying.  It is the Brother of Mercy ransoming the slave,
It is Vincent de Paul rescuing the foundling.  It is the Bishop of
MIarseilles ministering to the plague-stricken.  It is the Archbishop
of Paris entering with a smile that formidable Faubourg of St.
Antoine,* elevating his crucifix above the smoke of civil war, and
counting it little loss to encounter death, so that he might bring peace!
This is the true, the real religious instruction,- profound, efficacious,
popular; and which, happily for religion and for humanity, makes
even miore Christians than you unmake!
28. NECESSITY OF RELIGION.- Original Translation from Victor Hugo.
GENTLEMEN, it is not because I would prevent religious instructions
but because I would prevent the union of Church and State, that I
oppose this Bill.  So far from wishing to proscribe religious instruction, I maintain that it is more essential at this day than ever. The
more a man grows, the more he ought to believe. As he draws nearer
to God, the better ought he to recognize His existence. It is the
wretched tendency of our times to base all calculations, all efforts, on
this life only, - to crowd everything into this narrow span.  In limiting man's end and aim to this terrestrial and material existence, we
aggravate all his miseries by the terrible negation at its close.  We
add to the burthens of the unfortunate the insupportable weight of a
hopeless hereafter. God's law of suffering we convert, by our unbelief, into hell's law of despair.  Hence these deplorable social convulsions.
That I am one of those who desire-- I will not say with sincer.
ity merely, but, with inexpressible ardor, and by all possible means--
to ameliorate the material condition of the suffering classes in this
life, no one in this Assembly will doubt. But the first and greatest
of ameliorations is to impart hope. How do our finite miseries dwindle,
in the presence of an infinite hope!  Our first duty, then, whether we
be clergymen or laymen, bishops or legislators, priests or writers, is
not merely to direct all our social energies to the abatement of physical misery, but, at the same time, to lift every drooping head towards
Heaven, - to fix the attention and the faith of every human soul on
that ulterior life, where justice shall preside, where justice shiall be
awarded! Let us proclaim it aloud to all, No one shall unjustly or
needlessly suffer! Death is restitution. The law of the material world
is gravitation; of the moral world, equity. At the end of all, reap.

SUCCESS IN ORATORY.
For the attainment of the highest and most beneficent triumphs of the
orator, no degree of labor can be regarded as idly bestowed. Attention,
energy of will, daily practice, are indispensable to success in this high art.
The author of" Self-Formation " remarks: " Suppose a man, by dint of medl
itation on Oratory, and by his consequent conviction of its importance, to
have wrought himself up to an energy of will respecting it, - this is the life
and soul of his enterprise. To carry this energy into act, he should begin
with a few sentences from any speech or sermon; he should commit them
thoroughly, work their spirit into his mind, and then' proceed to evolve that
spirit by recitation. Let him assume the person of the original speaker,- put
himself in his place, to all intents and purposes. Let him utter every sentence, and every considerable member of it,- if it be a jointed one,-distinctly,
sustainedly, and unrespiringly; suiting, of course, everywhere his tone and
emphasis to the spirit of the composition. Let him do this till the exercise shall
have become a habit, as it were, a second nature, till it shall seem unnatural
to him to do otherwise, and he will then have laid his corner-stone."
Quintilian tells us that it is the good man only who can become a great
orator. Eloquence, the selectest boon which Heaven has bestowed on man,
can never ally itself, in its highest moods, with vice. The speaker must be
himself thoroughly sincere, in order to produce a conviction of his sincerity in
the minds of others. His own sympathies must be warm and genial, if he
would reach and quicken those of his hearers. Would he denounce oppression   His own heart must be free from every quality that contributes to
make the tyranrt. Would he invoke mercy in behalf of a client? He must
himself be humane, generous and forgiving. Would he lash the guilty? His
own life and character must present no weak points, to which the guilty may
point in derision. And not only the great orator, but the pupil who would
fittihgly interpret the great orator, and declaim what has fallen from his lips,
must aim at similar qualifications of mind and heart.
DIVISIONS OF ORATORY.
The Greeks divided discourses according to their contents, as relating to
precept, manners, and feelings; and as therefore intended to instruct, to
please and to move. But, as various styles may oftentimes be introduced into
the same discourse, it is difficult to make a strictly accurate classification.
The modern division, into the eloquence of the Pulpit, the Bar, and the Senate,
is hardly more convenient and comprehensive.
Oratory comprehends the four following divisions: invention, disposition,
elocution, and delivery. The first has reference to the character of the sentimuents employed; the second, to their arrangement, and the diction in which
the-v are clothed; the third and fourth, to the utterance and acticn with
whil;h they are communicated to the hearer. It is the province of rhetoric to
ive rules for the invention and disposition of a discourse. It is with the?tter two divisions of Oratory that we have to deal in the present treatise
II. ELOCUTION.
ELOCUTION is that pronunciation which is given to words when they are
arranged into sentences, and form discourse  It includes the tones of voice,
the utterance, and enunciation of the speaker, with the proper accompani,
ments of countenance and gesture. The art of elocution may there re be

ble, and, at the same time, great, worthy of intelligence, worthy of
liberty, - is to have perpetually before him the vision of a better wvorld
darting its rays of celestial splendor through the dark shadows of this
present life.
For myself, since Chance will have it that words of such gravity
should at this time fall from lips of such little authorlity, let me be per
mitted here to say, and to proclaim from the elevation of this Tribunle,
that I believe, that I most profoundly and reverently believe, in that
better world. It is to me more real, more substantial, more positive in
its effects, than this evanescence which we clirig to and call life. It is
unceasingly before my eyes.  I believe in it with all the strength of
my convictions; and, after many struggles, and much study and experience, it is the supreme certainty of my reason, as it is the supreme
consolation of my soul!
I desire, therefore, most sincerely, strenuously and fervently, that
there should be religious instruction; but let it be the instruction of
the Gospel, and not of a party.  Let it be sincere, not hypocritical
Let it have Heaven, not earth, for its end!
29. UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE, MAY 20, 1850.- Victor IIugo. Original Translation.
UNIVERSAL suffrage!- what is it but the overthrow of violence and
brute force -the end of the material and the beginiing of the moral
fact? What was the Revolution of February intended to establish in
France, if not this?  And now it is proposed to abolish this sacred
right! And what is its abolition, but the reintroduction of the right
of insurrection? Ye Ministers and men of State, who govern, wherefore do you venture on this mad attempt?  I will tell you.  It is
because the People have deemed worthy of their votes men whom
you judge worthy of your insults! It is because the People have presumed to compare your promises with your acts; because they do not
find your Administration altogether sublime; because they have dared
peaceably to instruct you through the ballot-box! Theretbre it is, that
your anger is roused, and that, under the pretence that Society is in
peril, you seek to chastise the People, - to take them in hand! And
so, like that maniac of whom History tells, you beat the ocean with
rods!  And so you launch at us your poor little laws, furious but
feeble! And so you defy the spirit of the age, defy the good sense
of the public, defy the Democracy, and tear your unfortunate filager
nails against the granite of universal suffrage!
Go on, Gentlemen! Proceed! Disfranchise, if you will, three
millions of voters, four millions, nay, eight millions out of nine! Get
rid of all these! It will not matter.  What you cannot get rid of is
your cwn fatal incapacity and ignorance; your own antipathy for the
188SENATORIAL. -- HUGO.
People, and theirs for you! What you cannot get rid of is the time
that marches, and the hour that strikes; is the earth that revolves,
the onward nmovement of ideas, the crippled pace of prejudices; the
widening gulf between you and the age, between you and the coming
generation, between you and the spirit of liberty, between you and the
spirit of philosophy! What you cannot get rid of is the great fct
that you and the Nation pass on opposite sides; that what is to you
the East is to her the West; and that, while you turn your back on the
Future, this great People of France, their foreheads all bathed in light
from the day-spring of a new humanity, turn their back on the Past!
*Ah! Whether you will it or no, the Past is passed. Your law is
null, void and dead, even before its birth: because it is not just;
because it is not true; because, while it goes fihrtively to plunder the
poor man and the weak of his right of sufliage, it encounters the withering glance of a Nation's probity and sense of right, before which your
work of darkness shall vanish; because, in the depths of the conscience
of every citizen, - of the humblest as well as the higlest, - there is a
sentiment sublime, sacred, indestructible, incorruptible, eternal, - the
Rig,t! This sentiment, which is the very element of reason in man,
the granite of the human conscience, - this Riioht. is thc 1 rock upon
which shall split and go to pieces the iniquities, the hypocrisies, the
bad laws and bad governments, of the world. There is the obstacle,
concealed, invisible, - lost to view in the sosl's profoundest deep, but
eternally present and abiding, - against which you shall always strike,
and which you shall never wear away, do what you will! I repeat it,
your efforts are in vain. You cannot deracinate, vou cannot shake it.
You might sooner tear up the eternal Rock from  the bottom of the
sea, than the Right from the heart of the People!
30. LIBERTY OF TIIE PRES, 1859.- Origznal Translation from Victor Hugo.
I-IAwNG restricted universal suffrage and the right of public meetings, you now wage war against the liberty of the Press. In the
crisis through which we are passing, it is asked, "Who is making all
this trouble? Who is the culprit? Whom must we punish? " The
alarm party in Europe say, " It is France!"  In France they say,
"It is Paris! "  In Paris they say, "It is the Press! "  The man
of observation and reflection says, "The culprit is not the Press; it
is not Paris; it is not France;-- it is the human mind!"  Yes, it is
the human mind, which has made the Nations what they are; which,
fTom a ihe beginning, has scrutinized, examined, discussed, debated,
doubted, contradicted, probed, affirmed, and pursued without ceasing,
the solution of the problem, eternally placed before the creature by the
Creator.  It is the human mind which, continually persecated,
opposed, driven back, headed off, has disappeared only to appear again;
and, passing from one labor to another, has taken successively, from
age to age, the figure of all the great agitators. It is the human

mind, which was named John Huss, and which did not die on the
funeral-pile of Constance; which was named Luther, and shook orthodoxy to its centre; which was named Voltaire, and shook faith; which
was named cMirabeau, and shoolc royalty.  It is the human mind,
whichl, since history began, has transformed societies and governments
according to a law progressively acceptable to the reason, - wnich has
been theocracy, aristocracy, monarchy, and which is to-day demuce
acy. It is the human mind, which has been Babylon, Tyre, Jernusa
lem, Athens, and which to-day is Paris; which has been, turn by
turn, and sometimes all at once, error, illusion, schism, protcstation
trutlh; it is the human mind, which is the great pastor of the generations, a.nd which, in short, has always marched towards the Just, the
Beaiutiful and the True, enlightening multitudes, elevating life, raising
more and more the head of the People towards the Right, and the
head of the individual towards God!
And now I address myself to the alarm party, - not in tlis Chamber,
but wherever they may be, throughout Europe, - and I say to them:
Consider well what you would do; reflect on the task that you have
undertaken; and measure it well before you commence.  Suppose you
should succeed: when you have destroyed the Press; there will remain
something more to destroy, - Paris!  When you have destroyed
Paris, there will remain France.  When you have destroyed France,
there will remain the human mind.  I repeat it, let this great Eurcpean alarm party measure the immensity of the task which, in their
heroism, they would attempt.  Though they annihilate the Press to
the last journal, Paris to the last pavement, France to the last hamlet, they will have done nothing.  There will remain yet for them to
destroy something always paramount, above the generations, and,
as it were, between man and his {Maker; - something that has written.
all the books, inivented all the arts, discovered all the worlds, founded
all the civilizations; - something which will always grasp, under the
form of Revolutions, what is not yielded under the forni of progress;
- something which is itself unseizable as the light, and unapproachable
as the sun, -- and  hich calls itself the human mind!
31. A REPLTBLIC OKI A MONARCHI Y?-Original tTranslationfrom Victor IHugo
On the question of revising the French Constitution, 1851.
GENTLEMIEN, let us come at the pith of this debate.  It is not our
side of the House, but you, the MIonarchists, who have provoked it..rhle question, a Reptblic or a Monarchy, is before us. No one has
any longer the power or the rioht to elude it.  For more than two
years, this question, secretly and audaciously agitated, has harassed
the country.  It weighs upon the Present.  It clouds the Futurc,
The moment has come for our deliverance from it.  Yes, the moment
has come for us to regard it face to face- to see what it is made of.
Now, then, let us show our cards! No more concealment!  I affirm
then, in the nane of the eternal Laws of human morality, that M3oneSENATORIAL. -- HUGO.
archy is an historickl faict, and nothing more.  Now, when the fact is
extinct, nothing survives, and all is told.  It is otherwise with r7ighlt.
Right, even when it no longer has fact to sustain it, - even when it
no longer exerts a material authority, - preserves still its moral
authority, and is always right.  Hence is it that, in an overtlhrown
Republic, there remains a right, while in a fallen Monarchy there
remains only a ruin.  Cease then, ye Legitimists, to appeal to us
from the position of right! Before the right of the People, which is
sovereignty, there is no other right but the right of the individmtl,
which is liberty.  Beyond that, all is a chimera. To talk of the
kingly right in this great age of ours, and at this great Tribune, is tc
pronounce a word void of meaning.
But, if you cannot speak in thle name of right, will you speak in tht
name of fact? Will you say that political stability is the offspring
of hereditary royalty, - and that Royalty is better than Democracy
for a State?  What! You would have those scenes renewed, those
experiences recommenced, which overwhelmed kings and princes:
the feeble, like Louis the Sixteenth; the able and strong, like Louis
Phnilippe; whole families of royal lineage, - high-born women, saintly
widows, innocent children! And of those lamentable experiences you
have not had enough? You would have yet more? But you are
without pity, Royalists, - or without memory! We ask your mercy
on these unfortunate royal families.  Good Heavens! This Place,
which you traverse daily, on your way to this House, - does it, then,
teach you nothing? - when, if you but stamped on the pavement, two
paces from those deadly Tuileries, which you covet still, - but stamped
on that fatal pavement, - you could conjure ip, at will, the SCAFFOLD
from which the old Monarchy was plunged into the tomb, or the CAn
in which the new royalty escaped into exile!
Ah, men of ancient parties! you will learn, ere long, that at this
present time, - in this nineteenth century, - after the scaffold of
Louis the Sixteenth, after the downfall of Napoleon, after the exile of
Charles the Tenth, after the flight of Louis Philippe, after the French
Revolutiog in a word. - that is to say, after this renewal, complete,
absolute, prodigious, of principles, convictions, opinions, situations,
influences, and facts, -it is the Republic which is solid ground, and
the BMonarchy whioh is the perilous venture!

France who now speak to us of a monarchy of glory.  Legitimacy

socialist manifestoes terminating in a jesuitical policy; and, for a Government, one immense intrigue,- history, perchance, will call it a.
conspiracy, ---by which the Republic is to be made the basis of the
Empire through the Bonapartist free-masonry of five hundred thousand
office-holders; every reform postponed or smothered; burdensome taxes
maintained or reestablished; the Press shackled; juries packed; too
little justice and too much police; misery at the foot, anarchy at the
he,ad, of the social state. Abroad, the wreck of the Roman Republic,
Austria - that is to say, the gallows-with her foot upon Hungary
upon Lombardy, upon Milan, upon Venice, a latent coalition of Kings,
waiting for an opportunity; our diplomacy dumb, I will not say an
accomplice! This is our situation. France bows her head; Napoleon
quivers with shame in his tomb; and five or six tho-usand hirelings
shout, " Vive l'empereur! " *
But nobody clreams of the Empire, you tell us.  WNhat mean, then,
those cries of Vive l'empereur? and who pays for them?  What
means this mendicant'petition for a prolongation of the President's
Tewers?  What is a prolongation? The Consulate for life! And
where leads the Consulate tor life?  To the Empire!  Gentlemen,
here is an intrigue. We will let in day-light upon it, if you please.
France must not wake up, one of these fine mornings, and find herself emperor-ridclen, without knowing why.  An emperor!  Let us
conlsider the subject a little.  Because there was once a man who
gained the battle of Marengo, and who reignecl, must the man who
gained only the battle of Sathry reign also?  Because, ten centuries
ago, Charlemagne, after forty years of glory, let fall on the face of
the globe a sceptre and a sword of such proportions that no one dared
to touch them; and because, a thousand years later,- for it requires
a gestation of a thousand years to produce such men, - another genius
appeared, who took up that sword and sceptre, and stood up erect
unler the weight; a man who chained Revolution in France, and
unchained it in the rest of Europe; who added to his name the brilliant syn6nyms of Rivoli, Jena,t Essling, Friedland, I9,"'i-rail; $
because this man, after ten years of a glory almost fatbutis in its
grandeur, let fall, in his turn, that sceptre and sword which had accomplished such colossal exploits,- you would conie, - yu, yout would
presume, after him, to catch theTn up as he did, - he, Napoleon, after
Charlemagne, -- and grasp in your feeble hands this sceptre of the
giants, this sword of the Titans! What to do?
What! after Augustus must we have August6ilus? Because we have
hal a Napoleon the Great, must we now have Napoleon the Little?
33. TIHE END OF GOVERNMIVENTT, 1641.-John Pym. Born, 1583; died, 1643.
MY LoxDs, many.days have been spent in maintenance of the
impeachment of the Earl of Strafford by the House of Commons,
whereby he stands charged with high treason; and your Lordships
have heard his defence with patience, and with as much favor as ju&amp;
* Pronounced Vee?o L'aunpphrehr.:  Yaynah  t Mon.hm.mera.h-P

tice -will allow.  We have passed through our evidence        and the
result is, that it remains clearly proved that the Earl of Strafford hath
endeavored by his words, actions and counsels, to subvert the fundamental laws of England and Ireland, and to introduce an arbitrary and
tyrannical government.    This will best appear if the quality of the
offence be examined by that law to which he himself appealed, that
universal, that supreme law, -   Salus P6piili, -  the welfare of the
People!   This is the element of all laws, out of which they are
derived; the end of all laws, to which they are designed, and in
which they are perfected. The offence comprehends all other offences
Here you shall find several treasons, murders, rapines, oppressions
perjuries. The earth hath a seminary virtue, whereby it doth produce all herbs and plants, and other vegetables; there is in this crime
a seminary of all evils hurtful to a State; and, if you consider the
reason of it, it must needs be so.
The law is that which puts a difference betwixt good and evil, -
betwixt just and unjust. If you take away the law, all things will
fall into a confusion. Every man will become a law to himself, which,
in the depraved condition of human nature, must needs produce many
great enormities.  Lust will become a law, and envy will become a
law; covetousness and ambition will become laws; andcl what dictates,
what decisions, such laws will produce, may easily be discerned in the
late government of Ireland! The law is the safeguard, the custody
of all private interests.  Your honors, your lives, your liberties and
estates, are all in the keeping of the law.  Without this, every mnan
hath a like right to everything; and such is the condition into -which
the Irish were brought by the Earl of Strafford!
This arbitrary and tyrannical power, which the Earl of Strafford
did exercise with his own person, and to which he did advise his
Majesty, is inconsistent with the peace, the wealth, the prosperity, of a:
Nation; it is destructive to justice, the mother of peace; to industry,
the spring of wealth; to valor, which is the active virtue whereby
only the prosperity of a Nation can be produced, confirmed, and
enlarged. It is the end of government, that virtue should be cherished,
vice suppressed; but, where this arbitrary and unlimited power is set
up, a way is open, not only for the security, but for the advancement
and encouragement, of evil.   It is the end of Government, that all
accidents and events, all counsels and designs, should be improved to
the public good; but this arbitrary power would dispose all to the
mniintenance of itself.
34. TI-IE EARL OF STRAFFORD'S DEFENCE.
Th. following manly and pathetic speech is extracted from the two closing addresses of
Thomas WentWorth, Earl of Strafford, on his impeachment before the House of Lords, in Westminster Hall, 1641. He was tried for high treason, in endeavoring " to subvert the ancient and
fnrldam,ntal laws of the realm, and to introduce arbitrary and tyrannical government." He
was founud guilty, and was executed the 12th of TIay, 1641, in his 47th year.

out zmoke to discover it, till it thus bursts forth to consume me afid
my children? It will be wisdom for yourselves, for your posterity,
nd for the whole Kingdom, to cast into the fire these bloody and mysterious volumes of constructive and arbitrary treason, as the primitive
C{hristians did their books of curious arts, andcl betake yourselves to
the plain letter of the law and statute, that telleth us what is a.nd
what is not treason, without being ambitious to be more learned in the
art of killing than our forefathers.  It is now two hundred and forty
years since any man was touched for this alleged crime, to this height,
before myself. Let us not awaken these sleeping lions to our destruction, by taking up a few musty records that have lain by the wall so
many ages, forgotten or neglected.  May your Lordships please not
to add this to my other misfortunes; let not a precedent be derived
fromin me, so disadvantageous as this will be, in its consequences to the
whole kingdom.
My Lords, the words fbr which I am here arraigned were not
wantonly or unnecessarily spoken, but they were spoken in full Council,
wlhere, by the duty of my oath, I was obliged to speak according to
my heart and conscience, in all things concerning the King's service.
If I had forborne to speak what I conceived to be for the benefit of
the King and People, I had been perjured towards Almighty God.
And, for delivering my mind openly and freely, shall I be in danger
of my life as a traitor? If that necessity be put upon me, I thank
God, by His blessing, I have learned not to stand in fear of him who
can only kill the body. If the question be, whether I must be traitor
to man or perjured to God, I will be faithful to my Creator; and,
whatsoever shall befall me from popular rage, or from my own weakness, I must leave it to that Almighty Being, and to the justice and
honor of my judges.
My Lords, you are born to great thouglhts; you are nursed up for
tlie great and weighty employments of the Kingdom.  But, if it be
once admitted that a councillor, delivering his opinions with others at
the council-table, under an oath of secrecy and faithfulness, shall be
brought into question upon some misapprehension or ignorance of law,
- if every word that he speaks fromn a sincere and noble intention
shall be drawn against hini for the attainting of him, his children and
posterity, -I know not any wise or noble person of fortune who will,
upon such perilous and unsafe terms, adventure to be councillor to
the King!   Opinions may make a heretic, but that they malie a
traitor I have never heard till now.
bMy Lords, what I forfeit myself is nothing; but that my indiscrem
tion should extend to my posterity, woundeth me to the very soul.
You will pardon my infirmity; something I should have added, bul
am not able, therefore let it pass. Now, my Lords, for myself, I
have been, by the blessing of Almighty God, taught that the afflic
tions of this present life are not to be compared to the eternal weight
of glory which shall be revealed hereafter  And so, my Lords, even

35. ON RPDUCING TIHE ARMY, 1732.- Win. Putlteney. Born, 1682; died. 1764
8iR, we have heard a great deal about Parliamentary armies, aind
about an army continued from year to year. I always have been, Sir,
and always shall be, against a standing army of any kind. To me it
is a terrible thing. Wlhether under that of' a Parliamentary or any
other designation, a standing army is still a standing army, whatever
lname it be called by. They are a body of men distinct from the body
of the. People. They are governed by different laws; and blind obedience, andl an entire submission to the orders of their commanding
officer, is their only principle.  It is indeed impossible that the liberties of the People can be preserved in any country where a numerous
standing army is kept up. By the military law, the administration
of justice is so quick, and the punishment so severe, that neither officer
nor soldier dares offer to dispute the orders of his supreme commander.
If an officer were commanded to pull his own father out of this House,
he must do it. Immediate death would be the sure consequence of the
least grumbling.  And if an officer were sent into the Court of
Request, accompanied by a body of musketeers with screwed bayonets,
and with orders to tell us what we ought to do, and how we were to
vote, I know what would be the duty of this House; I know it would
be our duty to order the officer to be taken and hanged up at the door
of the lobby; but, sir, I doubt much if such a spirit could be found in
this House, or in any HIouse of Commons that will ever be in England.
Sir, I talk not of imagnary things; I talk of what has happened
to an English House of Commons, and from an English armny; not
only froom an English army, but an army that was raised by that very
House of Commons, an army that was paid by them, and an army
that was commanded by Generals appointed by them. Therefore, do
not let us vainly imagine that an army, raised and maintained by
authority of Parliament, will always be submissive to them. If. any
army be so numerous as to have it in their power to overawe the Parliament, they will be submissive as. long as the Parliament does nothing
to disoblige thlleir favorite General; but, when that case happens, I am
afraid that, in place of the Parliament's dismissing the army, the
army will dismiss the Parliament, as they have done heretofore.  We
are come to the Rubicon.  Our army is now to be reduced, or it
never will be; and this Nation, already overburdened with debts and
taxes, must be loaded with the heavy charge of perpetually supporting
a numerous standing army, and remain Lorever exposed to the danger
of having its liberties and privileges trampled up D   by any future
King or Ministry who shall take it' in their heads to do so, and shall
take a proper care to model the armny for that purpose.THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
86. AGAIN'?T 1f6IE SUCCESSION OF RICHARD CROMWEILL TO THE PROTECTORATE, 1659. -Sir Henry Vane.
The fcllowing remarkable speech, which is given unabridged, as it appears in the Biographia
Brittanica, did not fail in its effect. Richard Cromwell never appeared in public again, after it
wvas delivered. "This impetuous torrent," says one of Yane's biograph-ers, " swept everything
)efore it. Oratory, genius, and the spirlit of liberty, never achieved a more complete triumph.
It was signal and decisive, instantaneous and irresistible. It broke, and forever, the power of
Richard and his party." Sir Henry Vane was borin in Kent, England, in 1612; was the fourth
Governor of the colony of Massachusetts, in 1636; anid was executed for high treason on Tower
Iill, in 1662.
MR. SPEAKER, -   Aniong all the people of the nniverse, I know none
who have shown so much zeal for the liberty of their country as the
English at this time have done;- they have, by the help of divine
PIrovidence, overcome all obstacles, and have mlade themselves free.
5Ve have driven away the hereditary tyranny of the house of Stuart,
at the expense of much blood and treasure, in hopes of enjoying hereditary liberty, after having shaken off the yokle of kingship; and there
is not a man among  us who could havre imnagined that any person would
ble so hold as to dare to attempt th, ravishing from us that freedom
which cost us so much blood, and so much labor.      13But so it happens, I
know not by vwhat misfortune, we are fallen into the error of those who
poisoned the Emperor Titus to make roomn for Domitian; who made
iaway Augustus that they might have Tibe-rius; and changed Claudius
for Nero.  I am sensible these examRples are foreign from my subject,
since the Romans in those days were buriedcl in lewdness and luxury,
whereas the people of England are now renowned all over the world
for their great virtue and discipline; and yet,   suffer an idiot, without
courage, without sense, -  nay, without anmbition,-  to have dominion
in a country of liberty!   One could bear a little with Oliver Cromwell, though, contrary to his oath of fidelity to the Parliament, contrary to his duty to the public, contrary to the respect he owed that
venerable body from whom he received his authority, he usurped
the Government. Iis merit was, so extraordinary, that Our judgments,
our passions, might be blinded by it.    le mnade his wvay to enmpire by
the most illustrious actions; he had under his conmnand an arrmy that
had made him a conqueror, and a People that had made himi their
General.   But, as for Richard Cromwell, his son, wvho is he? what are
his titles?  We have seen that he had a sword by his side; but did he
ever draw it? And, what is of more importance in this case, is hte fit
to get obedience from a mighty Nation, who could never make a footman obey hiim?     Yet, we must recognize this man as our King, under
th'e style of Protector! -  a man without birth, without courage, without
conduct!   For my part, I declare, Sir, it shall never be said that I
made such a man my master!

fiberty nor estate, will be affected.  But do the honorable gentlemen
consider my character and reputation as of no mloment?  IL it no
inputation to be arraigned before this House, in which I have sat forty
years, and to have my name transmitted to posterity with disgrace
andI infamy? I will not conceal my sentiments, that to be named
in Parliament as a subject of inquiry, is to me a matter of great corbern; but I have the satisfaction, at the same time, to reflect that the
impression to be made depends upon the consistency of the charge,
and the motives of the prosecutors. Had the charge been reduced to
specific allegations, I should have felt myself called upon for a specific
dtefence.  Had I served a weak or wicked master, and imnplicitly
obeyed his dictates, obedience to his commands must have been my
only justification  But, as it has been my good fortune to serve a
master who wants no bad iMinisters, and would have hearkened to
none, my defence must rest on my own conduct. The consciousness
of innocence is sufficient support against my present prosecutors.
Survey and examine the individuals who usually support the
measures of Government, and those who are in opposition. Let us
see to whose side the balance preponderates. Look round both Houses,
and see to which side the balance of virtue and talents preponderates.
Are all these on one side, and not on the other? Or are all these to
be counterbalanced by an affected claim to the exclusive title of patriotism?  Gentlemen have talked a great deal about patriotism. A
venerable word, when duly practised! But I am sorry to say that
of late it has been so much hackneyed about, that it is in danger of
falling into disgrace. The very idea of true patriotism is lost; and
the term has been prostituted to the very worst of purposes. A
patriot, Sir! -Why, patriots spring up like mushrooms! I could
raise fifty of them within the four-and-twenty hours. I have raised
nmany of them in one nighlt.  It is but refusing to gratify an unreasonable or an insolent demand, and up starts a patriot. I have never
been afraid of making patriots; but I disdain and despise all their
efforts. This pretended virtue proceeds from personal malice, and
from disappointed ambition. There is not a man amongst them whose
particular aim I am not able to ascertain, and- from what motive ho
has entered into the lists of opposition!

have hitherto deferred to answer the gentleman who declaimed against
the bill with such fluency of rhetoric, and such vehemence of gesture, - who charged the advocates for the expedients now proposed

agreeal)ly to this definition, good reading or speaking may be considered as
that species of delivery which not only expresses the sense of the words so as
to be barely understood, but at the same time gives them all the fkrce, beauty

ELOCUTION AMONG THE ANCIENTS.
Thz Greeks and Romans paid great attention to the study of elocution.
They distinguished the different qualities of the voice by such terms as hard,
smooth, sharp, clear, hoarse, full, slender, flowing, flexible, shrill, and rigid.
They were sensible to the alternations of heavy and light in syllabic utterance; they knew the time of the voice, and regarded its quantities in pronunciation; they gave to loud and soft appropriate places in speech; they perceived the existence of pitch, or variation of high and low; and noted further
that the rise and fall in the pronunciation of individual syllables are made by
a concrete or continuous slide of the voice, as distinguished from the discrete
notes produced on musical instruments. They designated the pitch of vocal
sounds by the term accent; making three kinds of accents, the acute ('), the
grave ('), and the circumflex('), which signified severally the rise, the fall,
ntd the turn of the voice, or union of acute and grave on the same syllable.
MODERN TIIEORIES OF ELOCUTION. -      THE   IEASURE OF SPEECH.
For the modern additions to elocutionary analysis, we are indebted rainly
to the labors of Steele, Walker, and Dr. James Rush of Philadelphia.
The measure of speech is elaborately explained by MPl Steele, in his "Prosodia Rationalis." According to his analysis, measure, as applied to speech,
consists of a heavy or accented portion of syllabic sound, and of a light or
unaccented portion, produced by one effort of the human voice. In forming
the heavy or accented syllable, the organs make a stroke or beat, and, however
instantaneous, are placed in a certain position, from which they must be removed
before they make another stroke. Thus, in the repetition of fast, fast, there
must be two distinct pulsations; and a pause must occur betwixt the two, to
enable the organs to recover their position. But the time of this pause may
be filled up with a light syllable, or one under remission; thus,faster,faster,
occupy the same time in the pronunciation as ftst,fast. This remiss or light
action of the voice may extend to two and three syllables, as in circumstance,
infinitely, &amp;c. The stroke or pulsative effort of the voice, then, can only be
on one syllable; the remission of the voice can give several syllables after the
pulsation. This pulsation aind remission have been illustrated by the plantino and raising of the foot in walking; hence the T'hesis and Arsis of the
Greeks. The first is the pulsative, the secoind the remniss action. Now, apart
from the pauses of passion and ctnnection, there must be frequelit pauses
arisinig from the nature of the organs of speech; these are dclenoted in exama
ples marked, according to Steele's system, by the figure, and the pulsati e
and remiss syllables by -.- and.. It has been said that the pulsative effiJ}
can be made only on one syllable; if the syllable have extended quantity, itI
may be pronounced both with the pulsativre effort and die away in the reaiission; but it it is short in quantity, a pause muLst occur before the pronlunelation of the next syllable.  One syllable, then, may occupy what is called
a measure, the voice being either prolonged, or the time being made up with
a pause. This pause, as already remarked, is denoted by the figure`; a
repetition of the same figure is used to denlote the longer pauses; which are
determined by passion, or the intirracy and remoteness of the.sense.'Steele's
system has been adopted by several teachers of elocution; by Mr. Chapman.8THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
of their adherents, and the loss of their influence, upon this new dis,
tovery of their folly, and their ignorance. Nor, Sir, do I now
answer  him  for any other purpose than to remind       him  how little the
clamors  of rage,  and the petulancy* of invectives, contribute to the
purposes for which this assembly is called together;--how              little the
discovery  of truth is promoted, and the security of the Nation established, by  pompous    diction, and   theatrical emotions.      Formidable
sounds and furious declamations, confident assertions and lofty periods,
may affect the young and inexperienced;        and perhaps the gentleman
may have contracted     his habits  of oratory by conversing more with
those of his own age than with such as have had more opportunities
of acquiring     knowledge, and more successful methods of communicating their sentiments.    If the heat of his temper, Sir, would suffer
hl im  to attend to those whose age and long acquaintance with business
give them  an indisputable  right to deference and superiority, he would
learn, in time, to reason rather than declaim, aind to prefer justness
of argument, and an accurate knowledge of Ifacts, to sounding           epithets,
and splendid superlatives, which may disturb the imlagination          for a
moment, but which leave no lasting impression on the mind.          He will
learn, Sir, that to accuse and prove are very different; and that
reproaches, unsupported      by evidence, affect only the character of him
that utters them.   Excursions of fancy, and flights of oratory, are,
indeed, pardonable in    you ng   men, but in no other; and it would
surely contribute more, even to the purpose for which soln        e gentlem nen
appear to speak (that of depreciating        the conduct of the administration), to prove the inconveniences and injustic    e of this Bill, than barely
to assert them, with whatever magnificence of language, or appearance
of zeal, honesty, or compassion.
39.  REPLY TO SIR R. WALPOLE, 1741.- filliam Pitt, afterwards Earl of Chatham
William Pitt, first Earl of Chatham,- one of the greatest orators of modern times, and especially endeared to Americans for his eloquent appeals in their behalf against the aggressions of
the Mother Country, -was born on the 15th of November, 1708, in the parish of St. James, in
the city of Westminster, England, and died on the 11th of May, 1778. His second sonl was the
celebrated William Pitt, whose fame equals, though it does not eclipse, that of his father.
"Viewing the forms of the two Pitts, father anid son," says a biographer of the latter, "as they
stand in Ilistory, what different emotions their images caU forth! The impassioned anid romantic father seems like a hero of chivalry; the stately and classical son, as a Roman dictator,
compelled into the dimensions of an English minister!"  "The principle," says Hlazlitt, "by
which the Earl of Chatham exerted his influence over others, was sympathy. Hie himself evidently had a strong possessionl of his subject, a thorough conviction, an intense interest; arid
this commuiicated itself from his manner, from the toises of his voice, from his commanding
attitudes, and eager gestures, iistinctively and unavoidably, to his hearers." The first soumd is
said to have terrified Sir Robert Walpole, wlho immediately exclaimed, " We must muzzle that
terrible comrnet of hlorse." Sir Robert offered to promote Mr. Pitt in the army,provided hlie gave
up his seat in Parliament. Probably Mr. Pitt was unwarrantably severe in the following reply
to the fore roing remarks of Sir Robert. The reply appeared originally in Dr. Johnson's Register of Debates, and probably received many touches from his pen.
Sin,-   The atrocious crime of being a young     man, which the honorable gentleman has, with such spirit and decency, charged upon me, I
shall neither attempt to palliate nor deny; -but content myself with
wishing that I may be one of those whose follies may cease with their

youth, and not of that number who are ignorant in spite of experience.
Whether youth can be imputed to any man as a reproach, I will not,
Sir, assume the province of determining; - but surely age may beome
justly contemptible, if the opportunities which it brings have passed
away without improvement, and vice appears to prevail when the
passions have subsided. The wretch who, after having seen the consequences of a thousand errors, continues still to blunder, and whose
age has only added obstinacy to stupidity, is surely the object of either
abhorrence or contempt, and deserves not that his gray hairs should
secure him from insult.  Much more, Sir, is he to be abhorred, who,
as he has advanced in age, has receded from virtue, and becomes more
wicked with less temptation;--who prostitutes himself for money
which he cannot enjoy, and spends the remains of his life in the ruin
of his country.
But youth, Sir, is not my only crime: I have been accused of
acting a, theatrical part.  A theatrical part may either imply some
peculiarities of gesture, or a dissimulation of my real sentiments, and
an adoption of the opinions and language of another man. In the first
sense, Sir, the charge is too trifling to be confuted, and deserves only
to be mentioned, to be despised.  I am at liberty, like every other
man, to use my own language; and though, perhaps, I may have
some ambition to please this gentleman, I shall not lay myself under
any restraint, nor very solicitously copy his diction or his mnien, however matured by age or modelled by experience. If any man shall,
by charging me with theatrical behavior, imply that I utter any sentiments but my own, I shall treat him as a calumniator and a villain
- nor shall any protection shelter him from the treatment he deserves.
I shall, on such an occasion, without scruple, trample upon all those
forms with which wealth and dignity intr-ench themselves, - nor shall
anything but age restrain my resentment; - age, which always brings
one privilege, that of being insolenlt and supercilious without punishment. But with regard, Sir, to those whom I have offended, I am of
opinion that, if I had acted a borrowed part, I should have avoided
their censure: the heat that offended them is the ardor of conviction,
and that zeal for the service of my country which neither hope nor
fear shall influence me to suppress.  I will not sit unconcerned while
my liberty is invaded, nor look in silence upon public robbery.  I will
exert my endeavors, at whatever hazard, to repel the aggressor, and
drag the thief to justice, - whoever may protect them in their villany.t,
and whoever may partake of their plunder.
40. IN REPLY TO MR. GRENVILLE, 1766.--Earl of Chatham.

sentiments with freedom agoainst this unhappy act, - and that freedom

this lTouse imputed as a crime.  But the imputation shall not dis.
courage me.  The Gentleman tells us, America is obstinate; America
is almost in open rebellion. I rejoice that America has resisted.
Three millions of people so dead to all the feelings of liberty as voluntarily to let themselves be made slaves would have been fit instruments
to make slaves of all the rest.  I come not here armed at all points
with law cases and acts of Parliament, with the statute-book doubled
dlown in dogs' ears, to defend the cause of liberty. I would not debate
a particular point of law with the Gentleman.  I know his abilities.
But, for the defence of liberty, upon a general principle, upon a Constitutional principle, it is a ground on which I stand firm, - on which I
dare meet any man.
The Gentleman boasts of his bounties to America. Are not those
bounties intended finally for the benefit of this Kingdom?  If they
are not, he has misapplied the national treasures.  He asks, When
were the Colonies emancipated?  I desire to know when they were
made slaves! But I dwell not upon words.   I will be bold to affirmu
that the profits of Great Britain from  the trade of the Colonies,
through all its branches, are two millions a year.  This is the fund
that carried you triumphantly through the last war. This is the price
America pays for her protection.  And shall a miserable financier
come, with a boast that he can fetch a pepper-cornl into the Exchequer,
by the loss of millions to the Nation? *
A  great deal has been said, without doors, of the power, of the
strength, of America.   It is a topic that ought to be cautiously
meddled with.  In a good cause, the force of this country can crush
America to atoms.   I know the valor of your troops; I know the
skill of your officers.  But on this ground, - on the Stamp Act,
when so many here will think it a crying iinjustice, -I am one who
will lift up my hands against it. In such a cause, even your success
would be hazardous.  Amlerica, if she fell, would fall like the strong
man.   She would embrace the pillars of the Statb, and pull down the
Constitution along, with her.  Is this your boasted peace? To sheathe
the sword, not in its scabbard, but in the bowels of your countrymen?
WVill you quarrel with yourselves, now the whole House of Bourbon is
united against you?  While Fraince disturbs your fisheries in Newfoundland, embarrasses your slave-trade to Africa, and withholds from
your subjects in Canada their property stipulated by treaty? while the
ransom for the Manillas is denied by Spain?  The Anlericans have
been wronged.  They have been driven to madness by injustice. Will
you punish them for the madness you have occasioned?  Rather let
prudence and temper come first from this side! I will undertake for
America that she will follow the example.

4.. THE FIRST STEP TO RECONCILIATION WITH AMERICA.--Earl of C4atnam.
Ja'n. 20, 1775, on. hlis nmotion to withdraw tihe British troops from Boston.
In regard to this speech, we find in the diary of Josiah Quincy, jr., the following mniemraa
llnm: "Attended the delates in the lIouse of Lords. Good fortune gave me one of the beht
places for hearing, and taking a few mirnutes. Lord Chatham lrose like 3Narcellus. 3Iis language, voice and gesture, were rmore pathetic than I ever saw or heard before, at the Bar or
Senlate. iHe seemed like an old Roman Senator, rising with the dignity of age, yet speaking
with the fire of youth." Dr. Franklin, who was also present at the debate, said of this speech,
that " he had seen, in the cou;rse of his life, sometimes eloquence without wisdom, a;ld often
wisdom vwithout eloquence; in the present inistance, he saw bothl united, andi both, as he theugh:,
in the highest degree possible."
AMERICA, my Lords, cannot be reconciled to this        country -- she
aught not to be reconciled -  till the troops of Britain are withdrawn,
fTow can America trust you, with the bayonet at her breast?       Itow
can she suppose that you mean less than bondage or death?       I therefore move that an addlress be presented to his Majesty, advising that
immediate orders be despatched to General Gage, for removing          his
Majesty's forces from  the town of Boston.   The way must be immediately opened for reconciliation. It will soon be too late. An hour
now lost in allaying ferments in America may produce years of calamity.  Never will I desert, for a moment, the conduct of this weighty
business. Unless nailed to my bed by the extremity of sickness, I
will pursue it to the end. I will knock at the door of this sleeping
and confounded Ministry, and will, if it be possible, rouse them    to a
sense of their danriger.
I contend not for inldulgence, but for justice, to America. What is
our right to persist in suLch cruel and vindictive acts against a loyal,
respectable people? They say you have no right to tax themrn without
their consent. They say truly. Representationll and taxation must go
together; they are inseparable.    I therefore urge and conjure your
Lordships imm  ediately to adopt this conciliating measure.   If illegal
violences have been, as it is said, committed in America, prepare the
way -  open the door of possibility -  for acknowledgment anid satisfactioTn;  but proceed niot to such coercion -  such proscription: cease
your indiscriminate inflictions; amerce not thirty thousand; oppress
niot three millions; irritate them  not to unappeasable rancor, for the
fault of forty or fifty.  Such severity of injustice m ust forever render
incurable the wounds you have inflicted. What though you march
from town to town, from    province to province? W    hat though you
enforce a temporary and local submnission; - how shall you secure the
obedience of the country you leave behind you in your progress?
HIow  grasp  the dominion of    eighteen  hundred miiles of continent,
populous in numbers, strong     in valor, liberty, and   the means of
resistance?
The spirit which now resists your taxation, in Ame.a rica, is the same
which formerly opposed loans, benevolences and shiip-money, in Eng.
land; - the same spirit which called all England on its legs, and, by
201THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
+he M3ill of Rights, vindicated the English Constitation;-- the same.apirit which established the. great fundamental essential maxim of'
your liberties, that no szubject of England shall be taxed but by his
own consent.  This glorious Whig spirit animates three millions in
America, who prefer poverty, with liberty, to gilded chains and sordid
affluence; and who will die in defence of their rights as men, as free
men.   What shall oppose this spirit, aided by the congenial flame
glowing in the breast of every Whig in England? "'T is liberty to
liberty engaged," that they will defend themselves, their families, and
their country.  In this great cause they are immovably allied: it is
the alliance of God and nature, - immutable, eternal,- fixed as the
firmlament of Heaven.
42. REPEAL CLAIMED BY AMERICANS AS A RIGHT.--From the same
IT is not repealing this or that act of Parliament,--it is not
repealing a piece of parchment, - that can restore America to our bosom.
You must repeal her fears and her resentments; and you may then
hope for her love and gratitude.  But, now, insulted with an armed
force posted at Boston, irritated with a hostile array before her
eyes, her concessions, if you could force them, would be suspicious and
insecure, - the dictates of fear, and the extortions of force! But it is
more than evident that you cannot force them, principled and united
as they are, to your unworthy terms of submission.  Repeal, therefore, my Lords, I say! But bare repeal will not satisfy this enlightened and spirited People. You must go through the work. You
must declare you have no right to tax.  Then they may trust you.
There is no time to be lost. Every moment is big with dangers.
While I am speaking, the decisive blow may be struck, and millions
involved in the consequence. The very first drop of blood shed in
civil and unnatural war will make a wouind which years, perhaps ages,
may not heal.  It will be imm~dYicabile vulntus.
When'your Lordships look at the papers transmitted to us from
America, - when you consider their decency, firmness, and wisdom, -
you cannot but respect their cause, and wish to make it your own. I must
declare and avow, that, in the master States of the world, I know not
the People nor the Senate, who, under such a complication of difficult
circumllstances, can stand in preference to the delegates of America
assembled in General Congress at Philadelphia. For geiuine sagacity,
for singular moderation, for solid wisdom, manly spirit, sublime sentimnents, and simplicity of language, - for everything respectable and
hlonorable, - they stand unrivalled. I trust it is obvious to your Lordships that all attempts to impose servitude upon such men, to establish despotism over such a mighty Continental Nation, niust be vain,
must be fatal. This wise People speak out. They do not hold the
language of slaves. They tell you what they mnean. They do not
ask you to repeal your laws as a favor. They claim it as a rightthey dehland it. They tell you they will not submit to them. And,02SENATORIAL. --EARL OF'IHATiLTM.
I tell you, the acts must be repealed.  We shall be forced ultimately
to retract.  Let us retract while we can, not when we must.  I say
we must necessarily undo these violent, oppressive acts.  They must
be repealed. You will repeal them. I pledge myself for it, that you
will, in the end, repeal them.  I stake my reputation on it.  I will
consent to be taken for an idiot, if they are not finally repealed.*
Avoid, then, this humiliating, this disgracefuil necessity.  Every
motive of justice and of policy, of dignity and of prudence, urges
you to allay the ferment in America, by a removal of your troops
from Boston, by a repeal of your acts of Parliament.  On the other
hand, every danger and every hazard impend, to deter you from perseverance in your present ruinous measures: -  foreign war hanging
over your heads by a slight and brittle thread, - France and Spain
watching your conduct, and waiting the maturity of your errors!
To conclude, my Lords: if the Ministers thus persevere in misadvising and misleading the King, I will not say that they can alienate
the affections of his subjects from the Crown, but I will affirm that
they will make his Crown not worth his wearing; I will not say that
the King is betrayed, but I will pronounce that the Kingdom is
undone!
43. LORD NORTII'S MINISTRY DENOUNCED, 17T5.--Id.
In reply to the Duke of Grafton.
THE noble Duke is extremely angry with me, that I did not consult
him before bringing in the present Bill. I would ask the noble Duke,
Does he consult me, or do I desire to be previously told of any
motions or measures hIe thinks fit to propose to this House?  This
Bill, he says, has been hurried. Has he considered how the case
really stands? Here we are told that America is in a state of actual
rebellion; and I am charged with hurrying matters! The opponents
of this Bill may flatter themselves that it will sink into silence, and
be forgotten.  They will find their mistake.   This Bill, though
rejected here, will make its way to the public, to the Nation, to the
remotest wilds of Amnerica!  It will, I trust, remain a monument of
my poor endeavors to serve my country; and, however faulty or
defective it may be, it will, at least, manifest how zealous I have been
to avert the storms which seem ready to burst on that country, and to
overwhelmn it forever in ruin.
Yet, when I consider the whole case as it lies before me, I am not
much astonished.   I am not surprised that men who hate liberty
should detest those who prize it; or that men who want virtue themselves should endeavor to depreciate those who possess it.  Were I
disposed to pursue this theme to the extent that truth would warrant,
I could demonstrate that the whole of your political conduct has been

servility, incapacity, and corruption. On reconsideration, I must
allow you one merit,- a strict attention to your own interests  In
that view, you appear sound statesmen and able politicians.  Ybou well
know, if the present measure should prevail, that you must instantly
relinquish your places.  I doubt much whether you will be able to
keep them on any terms.   But sure I am, such are your well-known
characters and abilities, that any plan of reconciliation, -however moderate, wise and feasible, must fail in your hands.  Such, then, being
your precarious situations, who can wonder that you should put a negative on any measure which must annihilate your power, deprive  you
of your emoluments, and at once reduce you to that state of insignificance for which you were by God and Nature designed?
44. AGAINST EMPLOYING INDIANS IN WAR.- Earl of Chatham.
In the course of the debate, November 18, 1777, during which the Earl of Chatham made the
eloquent speech from which the two following extracts are taken, the Earl of Suffolk, Secretary of State for the Northern department, advocated the employment of Indians in the war,
conltending that, besides its policy and necessity, the measure was also allowable on principle -
for that "it was perfectly justifiable to use all the means that God asnd Nature had put into
our hands." The following is a resumption of the Earl of Chlatham's speech of the same day.
WHao is the man that, in addition to the disgraces and miischiefs of
our army, has dared to authorize and associate to our arms the tomahawk and scalping-knife of the savage?  to call into civilized alliance
the wild and inhumnan.savage of the woods; to delegate to the merciless Indian the defence of disputed riohts; and to wage the horrors
of his barbarous war against our brethren? My Lords, these enormities cry aloud for redress and punishment; but, atrocious as they are,
they have found a defender in this House. "It is perfectly justifiable," says a noble Lord, "to use all the means that God and Nature
put into our hands."  I an4 astonished, shocked, to hear such principles confessed,- to hear them  avowed in this HIouse, or even in this
country; - principles equally unconstitutional, inhuman, and unchristian!   My Lords, I did not intend to have trespassed again upon
your attention; but I cannot repress my indignation - I feel myself
impelled by every duty to proclaim it.  As members of this House,
as men, as Christians, we are called upon to protest against the barbarous proposition. "That God and Nature put into our hands!"
What ideas that noble Lord may entertain of God and Nature, I
know not; but I know that such abominable principles are equally
abhorrent to religion and to humanity.  What! attribute the sacred
sanction of God and Nature to the massacres of the Indian scalpingknife, - to the cannibal savage, torturing, murdering, devouring, drinking the blood of his mangled victims!  Such horrible notions stlock
every precept of religion, revealed or natural; every sentiment of
honor, every generous feeling of humanity!
These abominable principles, and this more abominable avowal of
them, demand   most decisive indignation!  I call upon that R ight
Reverend Bench, those holy ministers of the Gospel, and pious pastors

I call upon the Bishops to interpose the unsullied sanctity of their

us from this pollution! I call upon the honor of your Lordships to

call upon the spirit and humanity of my country, to vindicate the

the tapestry that adorns these walls, the immortal ancestor  of the
noble Lord frowns with indignation at the disgrace of his country!
In vain did he lead your victorious fleets against the boasted Armada
of Spain, - in vain did he defend and establish the honor, the liberties, the religion, the Protestant Religion of his country, - if these
more than Popish cruelties and Inquisitorial practices are let loose
amiongst us! Turn forth into our settlements, among our ancient connections, fi'iends and relations, the merciless cannibal, thirsting for the

lyT Lords, this awful subject, so important to our honor, our Constitution, and our religion, demands the most solemn and effectual
inquiry.  And I again call upon your Lordships, and the united powers
of the State, to examine it thoroughly and decisively, and to stamp
upon it an indelible stigma of the public abhorrence.  And I again
imnplore those holy prelates of our religion to do away those iniquities
fiom among us.   Let them perform a lustration; let them purify this
IHouse and this country from this sin.  MIy Lords, I am old and weak,
and at present unable to say more; but my feelings and my indignation were too strong to have said less.  I could not have slept this
nighlt in my bed, or have reposed my head on my pillow, without giving this vent to my eternal abhorrence of such preposterous and enoriuous principles.
45. RUINOUS CONSEQUENCES OF THE AM{ERICAN WAR.--Earl of Chatham.
You cannot conciliate America by your present measures; you
cannot subdue her by your present, or by any measures. What, then,'$ Lord Howard of Effingham, who commanded the English fleet opposed to the
Spanish Armada, and from whom the Earl of Suffolk was descended. The tapestry
in the House of Lords represented the defeat and dispersion of the Spanish Armada,
in 1.588  In October, 1834, this tapestry was burned in the fire which destroyed
the two Houses of Parliament.
205THE STANDARD SPEAKER,
can you do?   You cannot conquer, you cannot gain, but you can
address. In a just and necessary war, to maintain the rights or honor
of' my country, I would strip the shirt from my back in its behalf.
BYut, in such a war as this, unjust in its principle, imr:'acticable in its
means, and ruinous in its consequiences, I would not contribute a single
effort, nor a single shilling.
My l,ords, I have submitted to you with the freedomn and truth
which I think my duty, my sentiments on your present awful situation.  I have laid before you the ruin of your power, the disgrace of
your reputation, the pollution of yohir discipline, the contamination of
your morals, the complication of calamities, foreign and domestic, that
overvwhlelm your sinking country.  Your dearest interests, your own
liberties, the Constitution itself, totter to the foundation.  All this
disgraceful danger, this multitude of misery, is the monstrous offspring
of this unnatural war.  We have been deceived and deluded too long.
Let us now stop short. This is the crisis, - it may be the only crisis,
-of time and situation, to give us a possibility of escape from the
fatal effects of our delusions.  But if, in an obstinate and infatuated
perseverance in folly, we meanly echo back the peremptory words this
day presented to us, - words expressing an unalterable determination
to persist in the measures against America, - nothing can save this
devoted country from complete and final ruin. We madly rush into
multiplied miseries, and plunge into "confusion worse confounded."
46. AMERICA UNCONQUERABLE.-Earl of Chatham, November 18, 1777, on the
Address of Thanlks to the King.
THIis, my Lords, is a perilous and tremendous moment. It is no
time for adulation. The smoothness of flattery cannot save us, in this
rugged and awful crisis.  It is now necessary to instruct the Throne,
in the language of TnUTH.  We must, if possible, dispel the delusion
and darlkness which envelop it; and display, in its full danger and
genuine colors, the ruin which is brought to our doors.  Can Ministers still presume to expect support in their infatuation?  Can Parliament be so dead to its dignity and duty as to be thus deluded into
the loss of the one, and the violation of the other; -  as'to give an
unlimitec support to measures which have heaped disgrace and misfortune upon us; measures which have reduced this late flourishing
empire to ruin and contempt? But yesterday, and England minght
h/ave stood acyainst the world: now, none so poor to do her reverence!  France, my Lords, has insulted you.  She has encouraged
and sustained America; and, whether America be wrong or right, the
dignity of this country ought to spurn at the officious insult of French
interference.  Can even our M3inisters sustain a more humiliating disgrace? Do they dare to resent it? [Do they presume even to hint a
vindication of their honor, and the dignity of the State, by requiring
the dismissal of the plenipotentiaries of America? The People, whorm
they affected to call contemptible rebels, but whose growing power haa

My Lords, this ruixlous and ignominious situation, whiere we eannl.t
act with success nor suffer with honor, calls upon us to renlonstrate
in the strongest and loudest language of truth, to rescue the ear of
MI ajesty from the delusions which surround it.  You cannot, I venture to say it, you CANNOT conquer America.  WVhat is your present
situation there'? W5Ve do not know the worst; but we know that in
three campaigns we have done nothing, and suffired mu:ch.  You may
swell every expense, and strain every effort, still more extravagantly;
accumulate every assistance you can beg or borrow; traffic and barter with every little pitiful German Prince, that sells and sends his
subjects to the shambles of a foreign country: your efforts are forever
vain and impotent, - doubly so from this mercenary aid on which you
rely; for it irritates to an incurable resentment the minds of your
enemies, to overrun them with the sordid sons of rapine and of
plunder, devoting them and their possessions to the rapacity of hireling cruelty! If I were an American, as I am an Englishman, while
a toreign troop was landed in my country, I never would lay down my
arms - never! never! never!
47. ON FREQUENT EXECUTIONS. 1777.--Sir WF. Mleredith.
WHETHIER hanging ever did, or can, answer any good purpose, 1
doubt: but the cruel exhibition of every execution-day is a proof that
hanging carries no terror with it. The multiplicity of our hanging
laws has produced these two things: frequency of condemnation, and
frequent pardons.  If we look to the executions themselves, what examples do they give?  The thief dies either hardened or penitent.  All
that admiration and contempt of death with which heroes and martyrs
inspire good men in a good cause, the abandoned villain feels, in seeing
a desperado like himself meet death with intrepidity. The penitent
thief, on the other hand, often makes the sober villain think, that by
robbery, forgery or murder, he can relieve all his wants; and, if he be
brought to justice, the punishment will be short and trifling, and the
r-ewardi eternal.
CWhen a member of Parliament brings in a new hanging law, he
begins with mentioning some injury that maybe done to private property, for which a man is not yet liable to be hanged; and then proposes the gallows as the specific and infallible means of cure and pre.
vention.  One Mary Jones was executed, whose case I shall jJust

WALKERd' ELEMENTS OF ELOCUTION.-- INFLECTIONS OF THE ViCJ.E
Towards the close of the last century, Mr. John Walker, author of the excelent " Critical Pronouncing Dictionary" which bears his name, promulgated
his analysis of vocal inflection. He showed that the primary division of speaking sounds is into the upward and downward slide of the voice; and, that what.
ever other diversity of time, tone or force, is added to speaking, it must
necessarily be conveyed by these two slides or inflections, which are, therefore, the axis, as it were, on which the power, variety, and harmony of speaking turn. In the following sentence: -" As trees and plants necessarily
arise from seeds, so are you, Antony, the seed of this most calamitous wmr,"'
- the voice slides up at the end of the first clause, as the sense is not perfected, and slides down at the completion of the sense at the end of the sentence. The rising slide raises expectancy in the mind of the hearer, and the
ear remains unsatisfied without a cadence. Walker. adopted the acute accent
(') to denote the rising inflection,, and the grave accent (') to denote the falling inflection; as thusDoes Cwesar deserve fdme' or blame'?
Every pause, of whatever kind, must necessarily adopt one of tnhese two
inflections, or continue in a monotone. Thus, when we ask a question without
the contrasted interrogative words, we naturally adopt the rising inflection on
the last word;,as,
Can Coesar deserve blame'. Impossible'!
Here blame - the last word of the question - has the rising inflection, con
trary to the inflection on that word in the former instance; and impossible,
with the note of admiration, the falling. Besides the rising and falling inflection, Walker gives the voice two complete sounds, which he terms circumflexes:
the first, which he denominates the rising Circumflex, begins with the falling
and ends with the rising on the same syllable; the second begins with the
rising and ends with the falling on the same syllable. The rising circumflex is marked thus, "; the falling, thus,'. The monotone, thus marked,
- - - -, denotes that there is no inflection, and no change of key.
Ilaving explained the inflections, Walker proceeds to deduce the law of
delivery from the structure of sentences, which he divides into compact, loose,
direct periods, inverted periods, &amp;c. By the term se? ies, he denotes an
enumeration of particulars. If the enumeration consists of single words, it
is called a simple series; if it consists of clauses, it is called a compound
teries. When the sense requires that there should be a rising slide on the
last particular, the series is called a commencing series; and when the series
requires the falling slide on the last p)articular, it is termed a concluding
series The simple commencing series is illustrated in the following sentencee
having two (1' 2') members:"' Honor' and shame' from no condition rise."
The simple concludiug series is illustrated in the following sentence of foux

wealth, and happiness'"HIIE STANDARb SPEAKER.
mention. She was very young, and most remarkably handsome. She
went to a linen-draper's shop, took some coarse linen off the counter,
and slipped it under her cloak; the shopman saw her, and she laid it
down: for this she was hanged. Her defence was (I have the trial
in my pocket), " that she had lived in credit and wanted for nothing,
till a press-gang came and stole her husband from her; but, since then,
she had no bed to lie on; nothing to give her children to eat; and
they were almost naked: and perhaps she might have done something
wrong, for she hardly knew what she did."  The parish officers testified the truth of this story: but it seems there had been a good deal
of shop-lifting about Ludgate; an example was thought necessary;
and this woman was hanged for the comfort and satisfaction of some
shopkeepers in Ludgate-street!
And for what cause was God's creation robbed of this its noblest
work? It was for no injury; but for a mere attempt to clothe two
naked children by unlawful means!  Compare this with what the
State did, and with what the law did! The State bereaved the woman
of her husband, and the children of a father, who was all their support; the law deprived the woman of her life, and the children of
their remaining parent, exposing them to every danger, insult, and
merciless treatment, that destitute and helpless orphans can suffer.
Take all the circumstances together, I do not believe that a fouler murder was ever commnitted agcaiist the law than the murder of this woman
by the law! Some who hear me are perhaps blaming the judges, the
jury, and the hangman; but neither judge, jury nor hangman, are to
blame; --they are but ministerial agents: the true hangman is the
member of Parliament. Here, here are the guilty; he who frames
the bloody law is answerable for the bloody deedl, - for all the injustice,
all the wretchedness, all the sin, that proceed from it!
48. ON PARLIAMENTARY INNOVATIONS. - Mr. Beaztfoy.
To calumniate innovation, and to decry it, is preposterous. Have
there never been any innovations on the Constitution? Can it be forgotten, for one moment, that all the advantages, civil and political,
which we enjoy at this hour, are in reality the immediate and fortunate
effects of innovation? It is by innovations that the English Constitution has grown and flourished. It is by innovations that the House! of
Commons has risen to importance. It was at different eras that t.he
counties and towns were empowered to elect representatives.  Even the
office of Speaker was an innovation; for it was not heard of till the
time of Richard the Second.  What was more, the freedom of speech,
now so highly valued, was an innovation; for there were times when
no member dared to avow his sentiments, and whenl his head must
have answered for the boldness of his tongue. To argue against innovations, is to argue against irnprovements of every kind. When the
followers of Wickliffe maintained the cause of humanity and reasor;
208against absurdity and superstition, "No innovation," was the cry; and
the fires of persecution blazed over tile Kingdom.  "Let there be no
innovation," is ever the maxim of the ignorant, the interested, and the
worthless. It is the favorite tenet of the servile advocate of tyranny.
It is the motto which Bigotry has inscribed on her banners.  It is the
barrier that opposes every improvement, political, civil, and religiou,.?To reprobate all innovations on the Constitution, is to suppose that it
is perfect. But perfection was not its attribute either in the Saxon
or Norman times.    It is not its attribute at the present moment.
Alterations are perpetually necessary in every Constitution; for the
Government should be accommodated to the times, to the circumstances, to the wants of a People, which are ever changing.
49. THE FOLLY OF RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION. - Compilatzon.
MI. SPEARER, it behoves the piety as well as the wisdom of Parliament to disappoint these endeavors to make religion itself an engine
of sedition. Sir, the very worst mischief that can be done to religion
is to pervert it to the purposes of faction.  I-leaven and hell are not
more distant than the benevolent spirit of the G-ospel and the malignant spirit of party.  The most impious wars ever made were those
called holy wars.  He who hates another man for not being a Christian is himself not a Christian. Toleration is the basis of all public
quiet.  It is a charter of freedom given to the mind, more valuable,
I think, than that which secures our persons andcl estates. Indeed,
they are inseparably connected; for, where the mind is not free, where
the conscience is enthralled, there is no freedom.  I repeat it; persecltion is as impious as it is cruel and unwise.  It not only opposes
every precept of the New Testament, but it invades the prerogative of
God Himself.   It is a usurpation of the attributes which belon g exclusively to the Most High.  It is a vain endeavor to ascend into His:
Throne, to wield His sceptre, and to hurl H-is thuinderbolts.
And then its own history proves how useless it is. Truth is immor
tal; the sword cannot pierce it, fire cannot consume it, prisons cannot
incarcerate it, famine cannot starve it; all the violence of men, stirred
up by the power and subtlety of hc ll, cannot put it to death.  In the
person of its martyrs it bids defiance to the will of the tyrant who perecutes it, and with the martyr's last breath predicts its own full and
final trnianpls.  The Pagan persecuted the Christian, but yet Chrisfianity lives.  The Roman Catholic persecuted the Protestant, but yet
Protestantism lives.  The Protestant persecuted the Roman Catholic,
bult yet Catholicism lives.  The Church. of England persecuted the
Nonconformists, and yet Nonconformity lives.  Nonconformists perse.
cuted Episcopalians, yet Episcopacy lives.  When persecution is carried to its extreme length of extirpating heretics, Truth may be extinguished in one place, but it will break out in another. If opinions
cannot be put down by argument, they cannot bv power.  Trulth gains

the victory in the end, not only by its own evidences, but by the suffer
ings of its confessors. Therefore, Sir, if we have a mind to establish
peace among the People, we must allow men to judge freely in mattelS
of religion, and to embrace that opinion they think right, withlout any
hope of temporal reward, without any fear of temporal punishment.
50. AMERICA'S OBLIGATIONS TO ENGLAND, 1765. - Col. Barrn, in reply to CAhr.v
Townshend, a member of the Ministry.
THE honorable member has asked:--  " And now will these Americans, children planted by our care, iourished up by our indulgence, and
protected by our arms, - will they grudge to contribute their mite?"
They planted by your care! - No, your oppressions planted them in
America! They fled friom your tyranny to a then uncultivated and
inhospitable country, where they exposed themselves to almost all the
hardships to which human nature is liable; and, among others, to the
cruelties of a savage foe the most subtle, and I will take upon me to
say the most formidable, of any People upon the face of God's earth;
and yet, actuated by principles of true English liberty, our American
brethren met all hardships with pleasure, compared with those they
suffered in their own country firom the hands of those that should
have been their friends.
They noutrisshed up by youtr indulgence! - They grew by your
neglect of them!  As soon as you began to care about them, that
care was exercised in sending persons to rule them, in on6 department
and another, who were, perhaps, the deputies of deputies to some members of this House, sent to spy out their liberties, to misrepresent their
actions, and to prey upon them; men whose behavior, on many occasions, has caused the blood of those sons of liberty to recoil within
them; men promoted to the highest seats of justice, some who, to
my knowledge, were glad, by going to a foreign country, to escape
being brought to the bar of' a court of justice in their own.
They protected by your arms! - They have nobly taken up arms
in your defence! - have exerted a valor, amidst their constant aeid
laborious industry, for the defence of a country whose frontier was
drenched in blood, while its interior parts yielded all its little savings
to your emolument. And, believe me,- remember I this day told
you so, - that same spirit of freedom which actuated that People at
first will accompany. them still; but prudence forbids me to explain
myself further.  God knows I do not at thig time speak from motives
of party heat. What I deliver are the genuine sentiments of my
heart.  However superior to me, in general knowledge and experience, the respectable body of this House may be, yet I claim to
know more of America than most of you, having seen and been
conversant in that country.  The People, I believe, are as truly
loyal as any subjects the King has; but they are a People jealous of
their liberties, and who will vindicate them to the last drop of their
blood, if they should ever be violated.

51. REPLY TO LORD NORTH, 1774. - Col. Barrd. Born, 1727, died, 1802.
When intelligence of the destruction of the tea at Boston, Dec. 18, 1773, reached England, it
was made the subject of a message from the Throne to both Houses of Pa]rliament. The bill
shutting up the port of Boston followed. Then succeeded two more measures, by one of which
the charter of Massachusetts Bay was entirely subverted, and the nomination of councillors.
magistrates, and all civil officers, vested in the Crown; and by the other it was provided, that
if any person were indicted in the Province of Massachusetts Bay for murder, or any other
capital offence, and it should appear to the Governor, by information. on oath, that the act was
c,,mmitted in the exercise or aid of the magistracy in suppressing tumults and riots, and that
a fair trial could not be had in the province, he should send the person so indicted to any other
bolony, or to Great Britain, for trial. While the two measures last named were pending, the
hfllowing remarks were made in Parliament by Col. BarrY.
Sin, this proposition is so glaring; so unprecedented in any former
proceedings of Parliament; so unwarranted by any delay, denial or
provocation of justice, in America; so big with misery and oppression
to that country, and with danger to this, -  that the first blush of it
is sufficient to alarm and rouse me to opposition. It is proposed to
stigmatize a whole People as persecutors of innocence, and men incapable of doing justice; yet you have not a single fact on which to
ground that imputation! I expected the noble Lord would have supported this motion by producing instances in which officers of Government in America had been prosecuted with unremitting vengeance,
and brought to cruel and dishonorable deaths, by the violence and
injustice of American juries.     But he has not produced one such
instance; and I will tell you more, Sir,--he cannot produce one! The
instances which have happened are directly in the teeth of his proposition.  Col. Preston and the soldiers who shed the blood of the People were fairly tried, and fully acquitted. It was an American jury.
a New England jury, a Boston jury, which tried and acquitted them.
Col. Preston has, under his hand, publicly declared that the inhabitants
of the very town in which their fellow-citizens had been sacrificed were
his advocates and defenders.   Is this the return you make them?     Is
this the encouragement you give them     to persevere in so laudable a,"
spirit of justice and moderation?     But the noble Lord says, " We
must now show the Americans that we will no longer sit quiet under
their insults."  Sir, I am sorry to say that this is declamation, unbecoming the character and place of him who utters it: In what
moment have you been quiet?      Has not your. Government, for many
years past, been a series of irritating and offensive measures, without
policy, principle or moderation?     Have not your troops and your
ships made a vain and insulting parade in their streets and in their
harbors?  Have you not stimulated discontent into disaffection, and
are you not now goading disaffection into rebellion?   Can you expect
to be well informed when you listen only to partisans?         Can you
expect to do justice when you will not hear the accused?
JLet the banners be once spread in America, and you are an undone
People. You are urging this desperate, this destructive issue. In
assenting to your late Bill,* I resisted the violence of America at the
hazard of my popularity there. I now resist your frenzy at the same risk

Provincials; but beware how you supply the want of discipline by desperation! What madness is it that prompts youi to attempt obtaining
that by force which you may more certainly procure by requisition?
The Americans may be flattered into anything; but they are too much
Aike yourselves to be driven. Have some indulgence for your own
likeness; respect their sturdy English virtue; retract your odious
exertions of authority, and remember that the first step towards inak;

52. BOLD PREDICTIONS, 1775.--John Wilkes. Born, 1717; died, 1797.
MIR. SPEAKER: The Address to the King, upon the disturbanllcs
in North America, now reported from the Committee of the whole
House, appears to be unfounded, rash, and sanguinary.  It draws
the sword unjustly against America. It mentions, Sir, the par.
ticular Province of Massachusetts Bay as in a state of actual rebellion.
The other Provinces are held out to our indignation as aiding and
abetting. Arguments have been employed to involve them in all the
consequences of an open, declared rebellion, and to obtain, the fullest
orders for our officers and troops to act against them as rebels.
Whether their present state is that of rebellion, or of a fit and just
resistance to unlawful acts of power, - resistance to our attempts to
rob them of their property and liberties, as they imagine, - I shall
not declare. This I know: a successful resistance is a revolution, not
a rebellion! Rebellion indeed appears on the back of a flying enemy  
but Revolution flames on the breast-plate of the victorious warrio7.
Who can tell, Sir, whether, in consequence of this day's violent and
mad Address to his Majesty, the scabbard may not be thrown away
by them as well as by us; and, should success attend them, whether,
in a few years, the independent Americans may not celebrate the
glorious era of the Revolution of 1775, as we do that of 1688?
The policy, Sir, of this measure, I can no more comprehend, than I
can acknowledge the justice of it. Is your force adequate to the
attempt? I am satisfied it is not. Boston, indeed, you may lay in
ashes, or it may be made a strong garrison; but the Province will be
lost to you. Boston will be like Gibraltar.  You will hold, in the
Province of Massachusetts Bay, as you do in Spain, a single town,
while the whole country remains in the power and possession of the
enemy. Where your fleets and armies are stationed, the possession
will be secured, while they continue; but all the rest will be lost. In
the great scale of empire, you will decline, I fear, from the decision
of this day; and the Americans will rise to independence, to power,
to all the greatness of the most renowned States! For they build on
the solid basis of general public liberty.
I tremble, Sir, at the almost certain consequences of such an
Address. founded in cruelty and injustice, equally contrary to the
212SENATORIAL. - WILKES.
sound maxims of true policy, and the unerring rule of natural right.
The Americans will certainly defend their property and their liberties
with the spirit which our ancestors exerted, and which, I hope, we
should exert, on a like occasion. They will sooner declare themselves
independent, and risk every consequence of such a contest, than submit
to the galling yoke which Administration is preparing for theni. A.n
Address of this sanguinary nature cannot fail of driving them  to
despair. They will see that you are preparing, not only to draw tho
sword, but to burn the scabbard. In the most harsh manner you are
declaring them REBELS! Every idea of a recbonciliation will now
vanish. They will pursue the most vigorous course in their own
defence. The whole continent of North America will be dismembered
firom Great Britain, and the wide arch of the i'aised Empire will fall.
But may the just vengeance of the People overtake the authors of
these pernicious Counsels! May the loss of the first Province of the
Emnpire be speedily followed by the loss of the heads of those Ministers
who have persisted in these wicked, these fatal, these most disastrous
measures!
53. CONQUEST OF THE AMERICANS IMPRACTICABLE, 1775.--John lfillkes.
SIR, it ill becomes the duty and dignity of Parliament to lose itself
in such a fulsome adulatory Address to the Throne as that now proposed..We ought rather, Sir, to approach it with sound and wholesome advice, and even with remonstrances, against the Ministers who
have precipitated the Nation into an unjust, ruinous, murderous and
felonious war. I call the war with our brethren in America an unjust
and felonious war, because the primary cause and confessed origin of
it is to attempt to take their money from them without their consent,
contrary to the common rights of all mankind, and those great fundamental principles of the English Constitution for which Hampden
bled. I assert, Sir, that it is a murderous war, because it is an effort
to deprive men of their lives for-standing up in the defence of their
property and their clear rights. Such a war, I fear, Sir, will draw
down the vengeance of Heaven on this devoted Kingdom. Sir, is any
Minister weak enough to flatter himself with the conquest of the
Americans? You cannot, with all your allies, - with all the mercenary ruffians of the North, - you cannot effect so wicked a purpose.
The Americans will dispute every inch of territory with you, every
narrow pass, every strong defile, every Thermopylme, every Bunker's
Hill! 3More than half the Empire is already lost, and almost all the
rest is in confusion and anarchy.  We have appealed to the sword;
and what have we gained? Bunker's Hill only, - and that with the
loss of twelve hundred men! Are we to pay as dear for the xest of
America? The idea of the conquest of that immense counm,y is as
romantic as unjust.
The honorable Gentleman who moved this Address sau7T, "'The
Americans have been treated with lenity."  Will facts istify the

assertion?  Was your Boston Port Bill a measure of lenity?        WMs
your Fishery Bill a measure of lenity? Was your Bill for taking
away the charter of Massachusetts Bay a measure of lenity, or even
3f justice?  I omit your many other gross provocations and insults,
by which the brave Americans have been driven to their present state.
Sir, I disapprove, not only the evil spirit of this whole Address, but
likewvise the wretched adulation of alm st every part of it. My wish
and hope, therefore, is, that it will be rejected by this House; and that
another, dutiful yet decent, manly Address, will be presented to his
Majesty, praying that he would sheathe the sword, prevent the further
effusion of the blood of our fellow-subjects, and adopt some mode of
negotiation with the general Congress, in compliance with their
repeated petition, thereby   restoring peace and harmony to this distracted Empire.
54. REPLY TO THE DUKE OF GRAFTON. --Lord Thurlow
Edward Thlurlow, who rose to be Lord High Chancellor of Groat Britain, was born in 17532,
and died in 1806. Butler, in his "Reminiscences," says: "It was my good fortune to hear his
celebrated reply to the Duke of Grafton, who reproached Lord Thurlow with his plebeian extraction, and his recent admission into the peerage. His Lordship had spoken too often, and began
to be heard with a civil but visible impatience; and, under these circumstances, he was attacked
in the manner we have mentioned. Lord Thurlow rose from the woolsack, and advanced slowly
to the place from which the Chancellor generally addresses the House of Lords, and then, fix
ing on the Duke the look of Jove when he has grasped the thunder, he said (in a level tone of
voice),' I am amazed at the attack which the noble Duke has made on me.' Then, raising his
voice,-' Yes, my Lords, I am amazed,' &amp;c."
I AM amazed at the attack which the noble Duke has made on me.
Yes, my Lords, I am amazed at his Grace's speech. The noble Duke
cannot look before him, behind him, or on either side of him, without
seeing some noble Peer who owes his seat in this House to his successful exertions in the profession to which I belong.    Does he not feel
that it is as honorable to owe it to these, as to being the accident of an
accident? To all these noble Lords the language of the noble Duke
is as applicable, and as insulting, as it is to myself. But I do not fear
to meet it single and alone.
No one venerates the Peerage more than I do; but, my Lords, I
must say that the Peerage solicited me, - not I the Peerage. Nay,
more, - I can say, and will say, that, as a Peer of Parliament, as
Speaker of this right honorable House, as keeper of the great seal,
as guardian of his Majesty's conscience, as Lord~ High       Chancellor
of England, -   nay, even in that character alone in which the nobl]
Duke would think it an affront to be considered, but which character none can deny me, -   as a MAN, -I am, at this moment, as respectable, -  I beg leave to add, I am as much respected, -     as the proudest
Peer I now look down upon!
X6. WORTH OF PRESENT POPULARITY. - Lord Alansfield. Born, 1705; died, 1783
Against Parliamentary exemption from arrest for debt, May 9, 1770.

po* larity, that applause bestowed by after ages on good and virtuous actions, I have long been struggling in that race: to what purpose,
all-trying Time can alone determine. But if he means that mu~shroom
popularity, which is raised without merit, and lost without a crime, he.
is much mistaken in his opinion. I defy the noble Earl to point out a
single action of my life in which the popularity of the times ever had
the smallest influence on my determination.  I thank God I have a
more permanent and steady rule for my conduct - the dictates of my
own breast. Those who have foregone that pleasing advice, and given
up their minds to the slavery of every popular impulse, I sincerely
pity: I pity them still more, if vanity leads them to mistake the shouts
of a mob for the trumpet of fame. Experience might inform them
that many, who have been saluted with the huzzas of a crowd one day,
have received its execrations the next; and many, who, by the popularity of their own times, have been held up as spotless patriots, have,
nevertheless, appeared on the historian's page, when truth has triumphed
ever delusion, the assassins of liberty. Why, then, the noble Earl can
think I am ambitious of present popularity, that echo of folly and
shadow of renown, I am at a loss to determine.
Besides, I do not know that the Bill now before your Lordships
will be popular; it depends much upon the caprice of the day. It
may not be popular to compel people to pay their debts; and, in that
case, the present must be a very unpopular Bill. It may not be popular, neither, to take away any of the privileges of Parliament; for I
very well remember, and many of your Lordships may remember,
that, not long ago, the popular cry was for the extension of privilege;
and so far did they carry it at that time, that it was said the privilege protected members even in criminal actions; nay, such was.the
power of popular prejudices over weak minds, that the very decisions
of some of the courts were tinctured with that doctrine. It wa,
undou'tedly, an abomninable doctrine; I thought so then, and I think
so still; but, nevertheless, it was a popular doctrine, and caine immediately from those who are called the friends of liberty, - how deservedly, time will show. True liberty, in my opinion, can only exist
when justice is equally administered to all, - to the king and to the
beggar. Where is the justice, then, or where is the law, that protects
a member of Parliament, more than any other man, from the punishment due to his crimes? The laws of this country allow of no place,
nor any employment, to be a sanctuary for criimes; and, where I have
the honor to sit as judge, neither royal favor nor popular applause
shall ever protect the guilty.
56. MAGNANIMITY IN POLITICS, 1775. -Edmund Burke. Born, 1730; died, 1797.
A REVENUE from America, transmitted hither?   Do not delude
yourselves! You never can receive it -no, not a shilling! Let the
Colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your
Government, and they will cling and grapple to you. These are ties
15THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
wvhich, tliough light as air, are strong as links of iron.   But let it
once be understood that your Government may be one thing and their
privileges another, -the   cement is gone, the cohesion is loosened!
Do not entertain so weak an imagination as that your registers       and
your bonds, your affidavits and your sufferances, your cockets and
your clearances, are what form   the great securities of your commere,
These things do not make your Government.            Dead   instruments,
passive tools, as they are, it is the spirit of the English communion
that gives all their life and efficacy to them. It is the spirit of the
English Constitution, which, infused through the mighty mass, pervades, feeds, unites, invigorates, vivifies, every part of the Empire, even
down to the minutest member.
I)o you imagine that it is the land tax which raises your revenue?
that it is the annual vote in the committee of supply which gives you
your army? or that it is the mutiny bill which inspires it with bravery
and discipline? No! Surely no! It is the love of the People; it is
their attachment to their Government from the sense of the deep stake
they have in such a glorious institution, which gives you your army
and your navy, and infuses into both that liberal obedience, without
which your army would be a base rabble, and your navy nothing but
rotten timber.  
All this, I know well enough, will sound wild and chimerical to the
profane herd of those vulgar and mechanical politicians, who have no
place among us; a sort of people who think that nothing exists but
what is gross and material; and who, therefore, far from being qualified to be directors of the great movement of Empire, are not fit to
turn a wheel in the machine. But, to men truly initiated and rightly
taught, these ruling and master principles, which, in the opinion of
such men as I have mentioned, have no suLbstantial existence, are, in
truth, everything, and all in all. Magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom; and a great Empire and little minds go ill
together.  Let us get an American revenue, as we have got an American Empire. English privileges have made it all that it is; English
privileges alone will make it all it can be!
57. ENTERPRISE OF AMERICAN COLONISTS, l175.-Edmund Burke.
Burke, the greatest of Irish statesmen, and unsurpassed as a writer of English prose, im
paired his immediate success as a speaker by a badly-regulated voice, and an infelicitous delivery. Grattan, his countryman and contemporary, wrote of him  "Butrke is unquestionably the
first orator of the Commons of England, notwithstanding the want of energy, the want of grace,
and the want of elegance, in his manner."  "He was a prodigy of nature and of acquisition.
Ile readl everything-he saw everything. His knowledge of history amounted to a power of
foretelling, and, when he perceived the wild work that was doing in France, that great political physician, cognizant of symptoms, distinguished between the access of fever and the force
of health, and wvhat others conceived to be the vigor of her constitution he knew to be the
paroxysm of her madness; and then, prophet-like, he pronounced the destinies of France, and
tnr his prophetic fury admonished nations."
FioR some time past, Mr. Speaker, has the Old World been fed
from the New. The scarcity which you have felt would have been a
desolating famine, if this child of your old age, - if America,with a true filial piety, with a  Roman cVtrity, had not put the fall

breast of its ycuthful exuberance to the mouth of its exhausted parent.
Turning from the agricultural resources of the Colonies, consider the
wealth which they have drawn from the sea by their fisheries. The
spirit in which that enterprising employment has been exercised
ought to raise your esteem and admiration. Pray, Sir, what in the
world is equal to it? Pass by the other parts, and look at the manner in which the People of New England have of late carried on the
whale fishery. Whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains
of ice, and behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses
of Hudson's Bay, and Davis' Straits, whilst we are looking for
them beneath the Arctic Circle, we hear that they have pierced into
the opposite region of Polar cold, that they are at the antip6des, and
engaged under the frozen serpent of the South. Falkland Island,
which seemed too remote and romantic an object for the grasp of
national ambition, is but a stage and resting-place in the progress of
their victorious industry. Nor is the equinoctial heat more discour.
aging to them than the accumulated winter of both the Poles. We
know that whilst some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon
on the coast of Africa, others run the longitude, and pursue their
gigantic game, along the coast of Brazil.  No sea but what is vexed by
their fisheries.' No climate that is not witness to their toils.  Neither
the perseverance of Holland, nor the activity of France, nor the dexterous and firm sagacity of English enterprise, ever carried this most
perilous mode of hardy industry to the extent to which it hlis been
pushed by this recent People; a People who are still, as it were, but
in the gristle, and not yet hardened into the bone, of manhood.
When I contemplate these things,- when I know that the Colonies
in general owe little or nothing to any care of ours, and that they are
not squeezed into this happy form by the constraints of a watchful
and suspicious Government, but that, through a wise and salutary neglect, a generous nature has been suffered to take her own way to perfection, - when I reflect upon these effects, when I see how profitable
they have been to us, I feel all the pride of power sink, and all pre.
sumption in the wisdom of human contrivances melt, and die away
within me. My rigor relents. I pardon something to the spirit of
liberty.
68. ON AMERICAN. TAXATION, APRIL 19, 1774.--Id.
COULD anything be a slubject of more just alarm to America, thah
to see you go out of the plain high road of finance, and give up your
most certain revenues and your clearest interests, merely for the sake
of insulting your Colonies? No man ever doubted that the commodity
of tea could bear an imposition of three-pence. But no coinmoditg
will bear three-pence, or will bear a penny, when the general feelings
of men are irritated, and two millions of men are resolved not to pay.
The feelings of the Colonies were formerly the feelings of Great
Britain. Theirs were formerly the feelings of Mr. Hampden, wbtk3S
217THE STANDARD SPEAKEY.
Among the Rules laid down by Walker and his followe s are the foll]wing,,Which we select as the most simple. The pupil must not take them, b.,wever,
as an infallible guide. Some are obvious enough; but to others the excep.
tions are numerous, - so numerous, indeed, that they wc aild be a burthensome
diharge to the memory. The Rules, however, may be serviceable in c aes
where the reader desires another's judgment in regard to the infi ction of
voice that is most appropriate.
RULEL. LWhen the sense is finish.ed, the:falling inffctionz takesl ace as,' Nothing valuable can be gained without labor'."
11. In a compact sentence, the voice slides up where the mean  g b hegins
to be formed; as, " Such is the course of nature', that whoever lives long,
must outlive those whom he lovsv and honors."
There are many exceptions to this rule. For instance, when t,,n emphatic
word is contained in the first part of the compact sentence, the f dlling inflection takes place; as, " tIe is a traitor to his cou ntry', he is a t.'aitor to the
human kind', he is a traitor to Heaven', who abuses the talen;s which God
has given him."
III. In a loose sentence, the falling inflexion is required; as, I" It is of
the last importance to season the passions of a child with dev'o'tion; which
seldom dies in a mindcl that has received an early tincture of it."
IV. In a compound commencing series, the falling inflection takes place
on every member but the last; as, " Our disordered hearts', our guilty passions', our violent prejudices', and misplaced desires', are ths instruments of
the trouble which we endure."
V. In a compound concluding series, the falling inflection takes place on
every member except the one before the last; as, " Chaucer most frequently
describes things as they are'; Spenser, as we wish' them to be; Shakspeare,
as they would' be; and Milton, as they ought' to be."
VI. In a series of commencing membersforming a climax, the last member, being strongly emphatic, takes afall instead of a rise; *s, " A youtih', a
boy', a child', might understand it."
VII. Literal interrogations asked by pronouns or adverbs (or questions
requiring an immediate answer) end with the falling     inflection;  as,
"Where are you going'?  What is your name'?"  Questions asked by verbs
require the rising inflection, when a literal question is asked; as, " Are you
coming'?  Do you heatJr?"
To these rules the exceptions are numerous, however. Emphasis breaks
through them continually  as,
Was ever woman in this humor wooed'  
Was ever woman in this humor won'.
VIII. The inflecton which terminates an exclamation is regulated by the
common rules of inflection.  Thlis rule is, of course, broken; throutgh by passion, which has slides and notes of its own.  Is a general rule, it may be
stated that exclamations of surprise and indigna.ion take a rising slide in
a loud tone; those of sorrow, distress, pity and love, the rising slide in a
gentle tone; and those of adoration, awe and dlespair, the falling infierlion.
IX. Sny intermediate clause affecting the sen.e of the sentence (generally
termed the mnodifying clause) is pronounced ira different keyfrom that in
which ihe rest of the sentence is spoken..ls tl intermediate words arefreTsuently tne pivot on which the sense of the  entence turns, the mind is
directed to it by a change of voice.  The voice,4nks at the beginning of the
clause, but rises gradually towards the conclus sn; as, " Age, in a virtuous'
person, carries in it an authority which makes it preferaLle to all1 the pleas.

wduld have made him a slave.! It is the weight of that preamble, of
which4 yo.u are so fond, and not the weight of the duty, that the
Aime,rans are unable and unwilling to bear.  You are, therefore, at
this moment, in the awkward situazion of fighting. for v phantom; a
quiddity; a thing that wants, not only a substance, but even a
name; for a thing which is neither abstract right, nor profitable
enjoyment.
They tell you, Sir, that your dignity is tied to it. I know not how
it happens, but this dignity of yours is. a terrible incumbrance to you;
for it has of late been ever at war with your interest, your ecquity,
and every idea of your policy. Show the thing you contend for to be
reason, show it to be common sense, show it to be the means of
obtaining some useful end, and then I am content to allow it what
dignity you please. But what dignity is derived from the perseverance in absurdity, is more than I ever could discern! Let us, Sir,
embrace some system or other before we end this session. Do you
mean to tax America, and to draw a productive revenue from thence?
If you do, speak out: name, fix, ascertain this revenue; settle its
quantity; define its objects; provide for its collection; and then fight,
when you have somethbng to fight for. If you murder, rob; if you
kill, take possession: and do not appear in the character of madmen,
as well as assassins, - violent, vindictive, bloody and tyrannical, without an object. But may better counsels guide you!
59. DESPOTISM INCOMPATIBLE WITII RIGHT, 1788.--Id.
MY LORDS, you have now heard the principles on which MIr. Hastings governs the part of Asia subjected to the British empire. Here
he has declared his opinion, that he is a despotic prince; that he is to
use arbitrary power; and, of course, all his acts are covered with that
shield.  "I know," says he, "the Constitution of Asia only from its
practice." Will your Lordships submit to hear the corrupt practices
of mankind made the principles of Government? He have arbitrary
power! --My Lords, the East-India Co(mpany have not arbitrary
power to give him; the King has no arbitrary power to give him;
your Lordships have not; nor the Commons; nor the whole Legislature. We have no arbitrary power to give, because arbitrary power
is a thing which neither any man can hold nor any man can give.
No man can lawfully govern himself according to his own4will,--much.eos can one person be governed by the will of another. We are all
born in subjection, - all born equally, high and low, governors and governed, in subjection to one great, immutable, pre6xistent law, prior to
all our devicos, and prior to all our contrivances, paramount to all our
ideas and to all our sensations, antecedent to our very existence, by
218SENATORIAL. - BURKE.
which we are knit and connected in the eternal frame of the universe,
out of which we cannot stir.
This great law does not arise from our conventions or compacts; on
the contrary, it gives to our conventions and compacts all the force and
sanction they can have;--it does not arise from our vain institutions.
Every good gift is of God; all power is of God; - and lie who has given
the power, and from whom     alone it originates, will never suffer the
exercise of it to be practised upon any less solid foundation than the
power itself. If, then, all dominion of man over man is the effect of the
divine disposition, it is bound by the eternal laws of Him that gave it,
with which no human authority can dispense; neither he that exercises it, nor even those who are subject to it; and, if they were
mad enough to make an express compact, that should release their
magistrate from his duty, and should declare their lives, liberties and
properties, dependent upon, not rules and laws, but his mere capricious
will, that covenant would be void.
This arbitrary power is not to be had by conquest.     Now can any
sovereign have it by succession; for no man can succeed to fraud,
rapine, and violence.   Those who give and those who receive arbitrary power are alike criminal; and there is no man but is bound to
resist it to the best of his power, wherever it shall show its face to
the world.
Law and arbitrary power are in eternal enmity. Name me a magistrate, and I will name property; name me power, and I will name
protection.  It'is a contradiction in terms, it is blasphemy in religion,
it is wickedness in politics, to say that any man can have arbitrary
power. In every patent of office the duty is included. For what
else does a magistrate exist? To suppose for power, is an absurdity
in idea. Judges are guided and governed by the eternal laws of
justice, to which we are all subject.  We may bite our chains, if we
will; but we shall be made to know ourselves, and be taught that man
is born to be governed by law; and he that will substitute will in the
place of it is an enenly to God.
60. IMPEACHMENT OF WARREN HASTINGS, 1788.--Id.
The unremitting energy of Burke's appeals, in the prosecution of Hastings, was a subject
of wonder at the time, and is a lasting memorial of his zeal in what he believed an honest
cause, for the admiration of posterity. Hastings himself has said of Burke's eloquence against
him, -" -For the first half-hour, I looked up to the orator in a reverie of wonder; and, during
that time, I felt myself the most culpable man on-earth." The trial of Warren ttastings comnmenced in Westminster Hall, Feb. 18, 1788. The whole process occupied ten years, from 1788
to 1795. On the 23d of April, 1796, Hastings was acquitted by a large majority of the Peers.
MY LORDS, I do not mean now to go further than just to remind.
your iLordships of this,--that Mr. Hastings' government was one
whole system of oppression, of robbery of individuals, of spoliation
of the public, and of supersession of the whole system of the English
Government, in order to vest in the worst of the natives all the
powv-er that could possibly exist in any Government; in order to defeat
219THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
the ends which all Governments ought, in common, to have in view
In the name of the Commons of England, I charge all this villany
upon Warren Hastings, in this last moment of my application to you.
My Lords, what is it that we want here, to a great act of national
justice? Do we want a cause, my Lords? You have the cause of
oppressed princes, of undone women of the first rank, of desolated
Provinces, and of wasted Kingdoms.
Do you want a criminal, my Lords? When was there so much
iniquity ever laid to the charge of any one? - No, my Lords, you
must not look to punish any other such delinquent from  India.
Warren Hastings has not left substance enough in India to nourish
such another delinquent.
My Lords, is it a prosecutor you want? You have before you the
Commons of Great Britain as prosecutors; and I believe, my Lords,
that the sun, in his beneficent progress round the world, does not
behold a more glorious sight than that of men, separated from a remote
people by the material bounds and barriers of nature, united by the
bond of a socikl and moral community;-- all the Commons of England resenting, as their own, the indignities and cruelties that are
offered to all the people of India.
Do we want a tribunal? My Lords, no example of antiquity,
nothing in the modern world, nothing in the range of human imagination, can supply us with a tribunal like this. We commit safely the
interests of India and humanity into.your hands. Therefore, it is
with confidence that, ordered by the Commons,
I impeach Warren Hastings, Esquire, of high crimes and misdemeanors.
I impeach him in the name of the Commons of Great Britain in
Parliament assembled, whose Parliamentary trust he has betrayed.
I impeach him in the name of all the Commons of Great Britain,
whose national character he has dishonored.
I impeach him in the name of the people of India, whose laws,
rights and liberties, he has subverted; whose properties he has
destroyed; whose country he has laid waste and desolate.
I impeach him in the name and by virtue of those eternal laws of
justice which he has violated.
I impeach him in the name of human nature itself, which he has
cruelly outraged, injured and oppressed, in both sexes, in every age,
rank, situation, and condition of life.
61. PERORATION AGAINST WARREN HASTINGS. -Edmund Burke.

ations, between which, as a link in the great chain of eternal order, we

net feared any odium whatsoever, in the long warfare which we nave
carried on with the crimes, with the vices, with the exorbitant wealth,
with the enormous and overpowering influence of Eastern corruption.
My Lords, it has pleased Providence to place us in such a state
that we appear every moment to be upon the verge of some great
mutations.  There is one thing, and one thing only, whtich defies all
mutation: that which existed before the world, and will survive the
fabric of the world itself, - I mean justice; that justice which, emanating from the Divinity, has a place in the breast of every one of us,
given us for our guide with regard to ourselves and with regard to
others, and which will stand, after this globe is burned to ashes, our
advocate or our accuser, before the great Judge, when Hie comes to call
upon us for the tenor of a well-spent life.
My Lords, the Commons will share in every fate with your Lordships; there. is nothing sinister which can happen to you, in which we
shall not, all be involved; and, if it should so happen that we shall be
subjected to some of those frightful changes which we have seen, -
if it should happen that your Lordships, stxipped of all the dec5rous
distinctions of human society, should, by hands at once base and cruel,
be led to those scaffolds and machines of murder upon which great
kings and glorious queens have shed their blood, amidst the prelates,
amidst the nobles, amidst the magistrates, who supported their thrones,
- may you in those moments feel that consolation which I am persuaded they felt in the critical moments of their dreadful agony!
My Lords, if you must fall, may you so fall,! but, if you stand, -
and stand I trust you will, - together with the fortune of this ancient
monarchy, together with the ancient laws and liberties of this great
and illustrious Kingdom, may you stand as unimpeached in honor as
in power; may you stand, not as a substitute for virtue, but as an
ornament of virtue, as a security for virtue; may you stand long, and
long stand the terror of tyrants; may you stand the refuge of afflicted
Nations; may you stand a sacred temple, for the perpetual residence
of an inviolable justice!
62. TO THE ELECTORS OF BRISTOL. -Edmund Burke.
GENTLEMlEN, I have had my day. I can never sufficiently express
my gratitude unto you for having set me in a place wherein I could
lend the slightest help to great and laudable designs. If I have had
my share in any measure giving quiet to private property and private
conscience; if by my vote I have aided in securing to families the best
possession, peace; if I have joined in reconciling kings to their subjects, and subjects to their prince; if I have assisted to loosen the
foreign holdings of the citizen, and taught him to look for his protection to the laws of his country, and for his comfort to the good will of
his countrymen; if I have thus taken my part with the best of men
in the best of their actions, - I can shut the book; -- I might wish

iave not lived in vain.
And now, Gentlemen, on this serious day, when I come, as it were,
to make up my account with you, let we take to myself some degree
of honest pride, on the nature of the charges that are against me. I
do not here stand before you accused of venality, or of neglect of duty.
It is not said that, in the long period of my service, I have, in a single
instance, sacrificed the slightest of your interests to my ambition, or te
Iny fortune.  It is not alleged that, to gratify any anger or revenge
of my own, or of my party, I have had a share in wronging or oppressing any description of men, or any one man in any description.  No!
the charges against me are all of one kind, - that I have pushed the
principles of general justice and benevolence too far, - firther than a
cautious policy would warrant, and further than the opinions of many
would go along with me.    In every accident which may happen
through life, - in pain,      ins depression and distress, - I will
3all to mind this accusation, and be comforted.
63. MARIE ANTOINETTE, 1790.* --Edmund Burke.
IT is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen of
France, then the Dauiphiness, at Versailles; and surely never lighted
on this orb, which she hardly seemed'to touch, a more delightful vision.
I saw her just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated
sphere she just began to move in, - glittering like the morning star,
pull of life; and splendor, and joy.  0! what a revolution! and what
a heart must I have, to contemplate without emotion that elevation
and that fall!  Little did- I dream, when she added titles of veneration to those of enthusiastic, distant, respectful love, that she should
ever be obliged to carry the sharp antidote against disgrace concealed
in that bosom; little did I dream that I should have lived to see such
disasters fallen upon her, in a Nation of gallant men, in a Nation of men
of honor, and of cavaliers! I thought ten thousand swords must have
leaped from their scabbards, to avenge even a look that threatened her
with insult.
But the age of chivalry is gone; that of sophisters, economists and
calculators, has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished
forever. Never, never more, shall we behold that generous loyalty to
rank and sex, that proud submission, that dignified obedience, that
subordination of the heart, which kept alive, even in servitude itself,
the spirit of an exalted freedom! The unbought grace of life, the
cheap defence of Nations, the nurse of mlanly sentiment and heroic
enterprise, is gone!  It is gone, that sensibility of principle, that
chastity of honor, which felt a stain like a wound, which inspired
courage whilst it mitigated ferocity, which ennobled whatever it
touched, and under which vice itself lost half its evil, by losing all
its grossness.

64. DECLARATION OF IRISH RIGHTS, 1780. - Henry Grattan.
elenry Grattan, one of the most renowned of Irish orators, was born in Dublin, on the 3d ot
July, 1746, and died bi 1820. In December, 1775, he took his seat in the Irish IIouse or
Commons; and from that time till 1800, he figured politically in that body chiefly. The Ir.bh
Revolution of 1782 3v as carried mainly by his efforts. Although a Protestant, he was a most
earnest adlvocate of the entire emancipation of the Catholics from all invidious distincetions and
disabilities. In 1805 Grattan took his seat in the British Parliames-t, whiere he becanme the
leading Champion of Catholic rights. The passages from his speeches in this collection bearing
date anterior to 1805 were pronounced in the Irish Parliament; those of a subsequent date;
werle delivered before the popular branch of the Imperial Parlliament. Of Grattan we may a(dd1
in the words of the Rev. Sydney Smith: - "No Government'ever dismayed him; the wor!ld
could not bribe him: he thought only of Ireland; lived for no other object; dedicated to her
his beautiful fancy, his manly courage, and all the splendor of his astonishing eloquence."
SIR, I have entreated an attendance on this day, that you nright, in
the most public manner, deny the claim    of the British  Parliament to
make law for Ireland, and with one voice lift up your hands against
it.  England now smarts under the lesson of the American war; her
enemies are a host, pouring upon her from    all quarters of the earth;
her armies are dispersed; the sea is not hers; she has no minister, no
ally, no admiral, none in whom she long confides, and no general whom
she has not disgraced; the balance of her fate is inr the hands of Ireland; you are not only her last connection, -     you are the only Nation
in Europe that is not her enemy. Let corruption tremble; but let
the friends of liberty rejoice at these means of safety, and this hour of
redemption.    You have done too much not to do more; you have gone
too far' not to go on; you hiave brought yourselves into that situation
in which you must silently abdicate the rights of your country, or
publicly restore them.     Where is the freedom      of trade?    Where is
the security of property?    Where is the liberty of the People?        I
therefore say, nothing is safe, satisfactory or honorable, nothing except
a declaration of righits.  What! are you, with three hundred thousand
men at your back, with charters in one hand and arms in the other,
afraid to say you are a free People?    If England is a tyrant, it is you
have made her so; it is the slave that makes the tyrant, and then
murmurs at the master whom he himself has constituted.
The British minister mistakes the Irish character; had he intended
to makle Ireland a slave, he should have kiept her a beggar. There is
no middle policy: win her heart by the restoration0of her rights, or
cut off the Nation's right hand; greatly emancipate, or fundamentally
destroy.  We may talk      plausibly to England, buLt so long as she
exercises a power to bind this country, so long are the Nations in a
state of war; the claims of the one go against the liberty of the other,
and the sentiments of the latter go to oppose those claims to the last
drop of her blood.     The English    opposition, therefore, are right;
mere trade will iot satisfy Ireland.     They judge of us by other great
Nations; by the Nation whose political life has been a struggle for
liberty, -  America!     They judge of us with a true knowledge and
ju.t deference for our character; that a country enlightened        as Ireland, chartered as Ire'and, armed as Ireland, and injured as Ireland,
will be satisfied with nothing less than liberty.
I might, as a constituent, come to your bar and demand my liberty
223THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
I do call upon you, by the laws of the land and their violation, by the
instruction of eighteen centuries, by the arms, inspiration and providence of the present moment, tell us the rule by which we shall go,
assert the law of Ireland.; declare the liberty of the land.   I will not
be answered by a public lie in the shape of an amendment; neither,
speaking for the subject's freedom, am I to hear of faction.       I wish
for nothing but to breathe, in this our island, in common with my fel
low-subjectz, the air of liberty.  I have no ambition, unless it be the
ambition to break  your chain, and contemplate your glory.        I never
will be satisfied so long as the meanest cottager in Ireland has a link
of the British chain clanking to his rags.  He may be naked,--he shall
not be in iron. And I do see the time is at hand, the spirit is gone
forth, the declaration is planted; and though great men should apostatize, yet the cause will live; and though the public speaker should
iie, yet the immortal fire shall outlast the organ which conveyed it,
and the breath of liberty, like the word of the holy man, will not die
with the prophet, but survive him.
65. REPLY TO MR. FLOOD, 1783.--Henry Grattan.
At the time of this speech in the Irish Parliament, Flood and Orattan, although previouly
friends, stood before the British public as rival leaders. A bitter animosity had arisen between
them; and Orattan having unfortunately led the way in personality, by speaking of his opponent's "affectation of infirmity," Flood replied with great asperity, denouncing Grattan as "a
mecndicant patriot," who, "bought by his country for a sum of money, then sold his coiuntry for
prompt payment." He also sneered at Grattan's "aping the style of Lord Chatham." To these
taunts Grattan replied in a speech, an abridgment of which we here give. An arrangement for
a hostile meeting between the parties was the consequence of this speech- but Flood was
arrested, and the crime of a duel was not added to the offence of vindictive personality, of which
both had been guilty. Grattan lived to regret his harshness, and speak in genlerous terms of his
rival.
IT is not the slander of an evil tongue that can defame me.           I
maintain my reputation in public and in private life.'No man, who
has not a bad character, can ever say that I deceived.        No countr).,:an call me a cheat.  But I will suppose such a public character.     I
sill suppose such a man to have existence. I will begin with his
character in his political cradle, and I will follow him to the last stage
of political dissolution. I will suppose him, in the first stage of his
life, to have beerP intemperate; in the second, to have been corrupt;
and in the last, seditious; - that, after an envenomed attack on the persons and measures of a succession of viceroys, and after much declamation against their illegalities and their profusion, he took office, and
became a supporter of Government, when the profusion of ministers had
greatly increased, and their crimes multiplied beyond example.
With regard to the liberties of America, which were inseparable
fromn ours, I will suppose this gentleman to have been an enemy
decidcled and unreserved; that he voted against her liberty, and voted,
moreover, for an address to send four thousand Irish troops to cut the
throats of the Americans; that he called these butchers "armed negotiators," and stood with a metaphor in his mouth and a bribe in his
pocket, a champion against the rights of America, -     of America, the
only hope of Ireland, and the only refuge of the liberties of mankind
224SENATORIAL. - GRATTAN A
Thus defective in every relationship, whether to constitution, commerce, and toleration, I will suppose this man to have added much
private improbity to public crimes; that his probity was like his
patriotism, and his honor on a level with his oath. IHe loves to
deliver panregyrics on himself. I will interrupt him, and say:
Sir, you are much mistaken if you think that your talents have been
as great as your life has been reprehensible. You began your parliamentary career with an acrimony and personality which could have
been justified only by a supposition of virtue; after a rank and clamor.
ous opposition, you became, on a sudden, silent; you were silent for
seven years; you were silent on the greatest questions, and you were
silent for money! You supported the unparalleled profusion and
jobbing of Lord larcourt's scandalous ministry.  You, Sir, who
manufacture stage thunder against Mr. Eden for his anti-American
principles, - you, Sir, whom it pleases to chant a hymn to the immortal Hampden; - you, Sir, approved of -the tyranny exercised against
America, - and you, Sir, voted four thousand Irish troops to cut the
throats of the Americans fighting for their freedom, fighting for your
freedom, fighting for the great principle, liberty!  But you found, at
last, that the Court had bought, but would not trust you,  Iortified
at the discovery, you try the sorry game of a trimmer in your progress
to the acts of an incendiary; and observing, with regard to Prince and
People, the most impartial treachery and desertion, you justify the suspicion of your Sovereign by betraying the Goverwnment, as you had
sold the People.  Such has been your conduct, and at such conduct
every order of your fellow-subjects have a right to exclaim! The
merchant may say to you, the constitutionalist I.yj say to you, the
American may say to you, - and I, I now say, and say to your beard,
Sir, - you are not an honest man!
66. NATIONAL GZRATITUDE, 1780.--Henry Grattan.
I SHALL hear of ingratitude.  I name the argument to despise it,
and the men who make use of it. I know the men who use it are not
grateful: they are insatiate; they are public extortioners, who would
stop) the tide of public prosperity, and turn it to the channel of their
owin emolument. I know of no species of gratitude which should
prevent my country from being free; no gratitude which should
oblige Ireland to be the slave of England.  In cases of robbery and
usurpation, nothing is an object of gratitude except the thing stolen, the
charter spoliated.  A Nation's liberty cannot, like her treasure, be
meted and parcelled out in gratitude.  No man can be grateful or liberal of his conscience, nor wozman of her honor, nor Nation of her liberty. There are certain unimpartable, inherent, invaluable properties,
not to be alienated from the person, whether body politic or body nat.
aral. With the same contempt do I treat that charge which says that
Ireland is insatiable; saying that Ireland asks nothing but that which
(reat Britain has robbed her of, - her rights and privileges. To say
15
225THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
that _relanld will not be satisfied with liberty, because she is not satisfied with slavery, is folly. I laugh at that man who supposes tfhat
Ireland will not be content with a free trade and a free Constitution
and would any man advise her to be content with less?
67. DISQUI' LIFICATION OF ROMAN CATHOLICS, 1793.--Henri 6:.ttan
You are struggling with difficulties, you imagine; you are nwis
taken, - you are struggling with impossibilities. In making laws on
the subject of religion, legislators forget mankind, until their own distraction admonishes them of two truths; - the one, that there is a God;
the other, that there is a People!  Never was it permitted to any
Nation, - they msy perplex their understandings with various apologies,  but never was it long permitted to exclude from essential, -
from what they themselves have pronounced essential blessings, - a
great portion of themselves for a period of time; and for no reason, or,
what is worse, for such reasons as you have advanced.
Conquerors, or tyrants proceeding from conquerors, have scarcely
ever for any length of time governed by those partial disabilities; but
a People so to govern itself, or, rather, under the name of Government,
so to exclude itself, - the industrious, the opulent, the useful, - that
part that feeds you with its industry, and supplies you with its taxes,
weaves that you may wear, and ploughs that you may eat, - to exclude
a body so useful, so numerous, and that forever! - and, in the mean
time, to tax them ad libitum, and occasionally to pledge their lives
and fortunes! - for what? - for their disfranchisement! - it cannot be done!   Continue it, and you expect from your laws what it
were blasphemy to ask of your Maker.  Such a policy always turns
on the inventor, afd bruises him under the stroke of the sceptre or the
sword, or sinks him under accumulations of debt and loss of dominion.
Need I go to instances?  What was the case of Ireland, enslaved for
a century, and withered and blasted with her Protestant ascendency,
like a shattered oak scathed on its hill by the fires of its own intolerance?   What lost England America, but such a policy?     An
attempt to bind men by a Parliament, wherein they are not represented! Such an attempt as some would now continue to practise on
the Catholics! Has your pity traversed leagues of sea to sit down by
the black boy on the coast of Guinea, - and have you forgot the man at
home by your side, your brother?
68. HEAVTEN FIGHTS ON THE SIDE OF A GREAT PRINCIPLE. - Grattan
THE Kingdom of Ireland, with her imperial crown, stands at your
Bar. She applies for the civil liberty of three-fourths of her children.
Will you dismiss her without a hearing? You cannot do it! I say
you cannot finally do it! The interest of your country would not support you; the feelings of your country would not support you: it is
226SENATORIAL. - GRATTAN.
a proceeding that cannot long be persisted in. No courtier so devoted,
no politician so hardened, no conscience so capacious! I am not afraid
of oceasional majorities.  A majority cannot overlay a great prinlci.
ple. God will guard His own cause against rank majorities. In vain
shall men appeal to a church-cry, or to a mock-thunder; the proprie.
tor of the bolt is on the side of the People.
It was the expectation of the repeal of Catholic disability whi,h ca,
ried the Union. Should you wish to support the minister of the crown
against the People of Ireland, retain the Union, and perpetuate the
disqualification, the consequence must be something more than alienation.  When you finally decide against the Catholic question, you
abandon the idea of governing Ireland by affection, and you adopt the
idea of coercion in its place.  You are pronouncing the doom of England. If you ask how the People of Ireland feel towards you, ask
yourselves how you would feel towards us, if we disqualified threefburths of the People of England forever. The day youfinally ascertain
the disqualification of the Catholic, you pronounce the doom of Great
Britain.  It is just it should be so. The King who takes away the
liberty of his subjects loses his Crown; the People who take away the
liberty of their fellow-subjects lose their empire.  The scales of your
own destinies are in your own hands; and if you throw out the civil
liberty of the Irish Catholic, depend on it, Old England will be weighed
in the balance, and found wanting: you will then have dug your own
grave, and you may write your own epitaph thus:-" ENGLAND DIED,
BECAUSE SHE TAXED AMERICA, AND DISQUALIFIED IRELAND."
69. INVECTIVE AGAINST MR. CORRY, 1800. -Henry Grattan..
A duel, in which Mr. Corry was wounded in the arm, was the sequel to this speech. The
immediate provocation of the speech was a remark from Corry, that Grattan, instead of having
a voice in the councils of his country, should have been standing as a culprit at her Bar.
IHAs the gentleman done?   Has he completely done?    He was
unparliamentary from the beginning to the end of his speech. There
was scarce a word that he uttered that was not a violation of the privileges of the House. But I did not call him to order. Why? Because
the limited talents of some men render it impossible for them to be
severe without being unparliamentary.  But before I sit down I shall
s,how him how to be severe and parliamentary at the same time. On
any other occasion, I should think myself justifiable in treating with
silent contempt anything which might fall from that honorable member;
but there are times when the insignificance of the accuser is lost in the
magnitude of the accusation.  I know the difficulty the honorable genlualman labored under when he attacked me, conscious that, on a comparative view of our characters, public and private, there is nothing he
could say which would injure me. The public would not believe the
charge.  I despise the falsehood.  If such a charge were made by an
tonest man, I would answer it in the manner I shall do before I sit
1own. But I shall first reply to it when not made by an honest man.
227PI[LOSOPHY OF THE HUMAN VOICE.
nounced, en order to distinguish it from the body of the sentence; and it is
pronounced more quickly, that the hearer may not be diverted by it into forgetting the connection of the sentence. It generally terminates with the
inflection of the clause preceding it.  fVhen it contatns a strongly emphatic
word, the falling inflection is necessary:
Let us (since life can little more supply
Than just to look about us and to die)
Expatiate free o'er all this scene of man;
A mighty maze! but not without a plan.
XI. dqn echo, or the repetition of a word or thought introductoi y to sonme
particulars, requires the high rising iVliection, and a long pause after it.
This isfrequently the language of excitement; the mind recurs to the exciting idea, and acquires fresh intensity from the repetition of it; as, " Can
Parliament be so dead to its dignity and duty as to give its sanction to
measures thus obtruded and forced upon it? -.Measures', my Lords, wldch
have reduced this late flourishing Kingdom, to scorn and contempt."
XII. When words are in co0tradistinction to other words, either expressed
or understood, they are protrounced with emphatic force, when the contra
distinction is not expressed, the emphasis must be strong, so as to suegest
the word in contradistinction; as, "How beautiful is nature in her wifdest'
scenes "   That is, not merely in her soft scenes, but even in her wildest
scenes. "It is deplorable when age' thus errs."  Not merely youth, but age.
XIII. A climax must be read or pronounced with the voice progressively
ascending to the last menmber - accompanied with the increasing energy, animation or pathos, corresponding with the nature of the subject.
See, what a grace was seated on this brow!
HIlyperion's curls'; the front of Jove himself';
An eye like Mars', to threaten and command';
A station like the herald Mercury",
New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill';
A combination' and a form' indeed,
Where every god' did seem to set his seal",
To give the world assurance of a man'.
RUSH'S PIIILOSOPHY OF THE HUIMAN VOICE.
Dr. PHush, whose " Philosophy of the Human Voice" presents the most
minute and scientific analysis of the subject that has yet appeared, adopts an
arrangement of the elementary sounds of our language into tonics, subtonics,
atonics and aspirates. He distinguishes the qualities of the voice under the
following heads: the Orotund, which is fuller in volume than the common
voice; the Tremor; the Aspiration; the Guttural; the Falsette; and the
Whisper. The complex movement of the voice occasioned by the union of
the rising and falling slides on the same long syllable he calls a wave. It
is termied by Steele and Walker the circumflex accent. -Dr. Rush illustraes
the slides of the voice by reference to the Diatonic scale, consisting of a sue.
cession of eight sounds, either in an ascending or descending series, and
enmbracing seven proximate intervals, five of which are Tones, tiand two Semitones  Each sound is called a Note; and the changes of pitch from anly one
note to another are either Discrete or Concrete, and may be either risinlg cr
talling. Concrete charsges of Pitch are called slides; and of these movements
there are appropriated to speech the slides through fivp different intervals, -
the Semitone, the Second, the Third, the Fifth, and the Octav7e. By a careful
analysis of the speaking voice, Dr. Rush shows that its movements can be
measured and set to the musical scale; and that, however various the combiu,tions of- these vocal movements maty at first appear, they may readily beTHE STANDARD SPEAKER.
The ight honorable gentleman has called me" an unimpeached tra]i
tor."  I ask, why not " traitor," unqualified by any epithet 2 I will
tell him; it was because he dare not! It was the act of a coward, who
raises his arm to strike, but has not courage to give the blow! I will
not call him villain, because it would be unparliamentarvy, and he is a
privy councillor. I will not call him fool, because he happens to be
Chancellor of the Exchequer. But I say he is one who has abusecl the
privilege of Parliament and freedom of dcebate, to the utterinlg ]ungtiage, which, if spoken out of the House, I should answer only with a
blow! I care not how high his situation, how low lhis character, how
conitemptible his speech; whether a privy councillor or a parasite, my
answer would be a blow! HIe has charged me with being connected

Does the honorable gentleman rely on the report of the House of Lords

I have returned to protect that Constitution, of which I was the parent
and the founder, from the assassination of such men as the honorable

70. UNION WITH GREAT BRITAIN, 1800. -Henry Grattan.
TI[E minister misrepresents the sentiments of the People, as he hias
sefore traduced their reputation.  He asserts, that after a calm aind
clature consideration, they have pronounced their judgment in favor of
an Union.  Of this assertion not one syllable has any existence in
fact, or in the appearance of fact. I appeal to the petitions of twentyone counties in evidence. To affirm that the judgment of a Nation
against is for; to assert that she has said ay when she has pronounced
no; to make the falsification of her sentiments the foundation of her
ruin, and the ground of the Union; to affirm that her Parliament,
O28229

constiitution, liberty, honor, property, are taken away by her own
authority, - there is, in such artifice, an effrontery, a hardihood, an
insensibility, that can best be answered by sensations of astonishment
and disgust.
The Constitution may be for a timne so lost.  The character of the
country cannot be so lost.  The ministers of the Crown will, or may,
perhaps, at length find that it is not so easy, by abilities however gi eat,
and by power and corruption howe-ver irresistible, to put down forever
an ancient ancld respectable Nation.  Liberty may repair her golden
beams, and with redoubled heat animate the country.  The cry of toyalty will not long continue against the principles of liberty.  Loycalty
is a noble, a judicious, and a capacious principle; but in these countries loyalty, distinct from liberty, is corruption, not loyalty.
The cry of clisaffection will not, in the end, avail against the princi.
ple of liberty.  I do not give up the country.  I see her in a swoon,
but she is not dead.  Though in her toamb she lies helpless and motionless, still there is on her lips a spirit of life, and on her cheek a glow
of beauty:
"Thou art not conquered; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips, and in thy cheeks,
And Death's pale flag is not advanced there."
WVhile a plank of the vessel sticks together, I will not leave her. Let
the courtier present his flimsy sail, and carry the light bark of his
faith with every new breath of wind'; I will remain anchored here,
with fidelity to the fortunes of my country, faithful to her freedom,
faithful to her fall!
71. THE CATHOLIC QUESTION, 1805. - Henry Grattan.
TILE P.arliament of Ireland! -of that assembly I have a parental
recollection. I sate by her craclle,-- I followed her hearse! In fourteen years she acquired for Ireland what you did not acquire for England in a century, - freedom of trade, independency of the Legislature,
independency of the judges, restoration of the final judicature, repeal
cf a perpetual mutiny bill, habeas corpus act, nullunr temlpus act, - a
great work! You will exceed it, and I shall rejoice.  I call my countrymen to witness, if in that business I compromised the claims of my
country, or temporized with the power of England; but there was one
thing which baffled the effort of the patriot, and defeated the wisdom
of the Senate,- it was the folly of the theologian!  When the Parliamnent of Ireland rejected the Catholic petition, and assented to the
calumnies then uttered against the Catholic body, on that day she
voted the Union: if -Yu should adopt a similar conduct, on that day
you will vote the separation. Many good and pious reasons you may
give; many good and pious reasons she gave; and she lies TIIERE, with
her mnany good and pious reasons!  That the Parliamnent of Ireland
should lave entertained prejudices. I am not astonished; but that you,
that you, who ao as individuals and as conquerors, visited a great"THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
part of the globe, and have seen men in all their modifications, aad
Providence in alf her ways, - that you, now, at this time of day, should
throw up dikes against the Pope, and barriers against the Catholic,
instead of uniting with that Catholic to throw up barriers against the
French, this surprises' and, _i addition to this, that you should ha"ve
setIup the Pope in Italy, to tremble at him in Irelanld; and, further,
that you should have professed to have placed yourself at the head of
a Christian, not a Protestant league, to defend the civil and religious
liberty of Europe, and should deprive of their civil liberty one-fifth of
yourselves, on account of their religion,-- this - this surprises me!
This proscriptive system  you may now remove.  What the best
men in Ireland wished to do, but could not do, you may accomplish.'Were it not wise to come to a good understanding with the Irish now?
The franchises of the Constitution! - your ancestors were nursed in
that cradle. The ancestors of the petitioners were less fortunate.
The posterity of both, born to new and strange dangers, -let them
agree to renounce jealousies and proscriptions, in order to oppose what,
without that agreement, will overpower both.  Half Europe is in
battalion agauinst us, and we are devoting one another to perdition on
account of mysteries, - when we should form against the enemy, and

72. RELIGION INDEPENDENT OF GO(VERNMENT, 1811. -Henry Grattan.
LET us reflect on the necessary limits of all human legislation. No
Legislature has a right to make partial laws; it has no right to make
arbitrary laws--I mean laws contrary to reason; because that is
beyond the power of the Deity.  Neither has it a right to institute
any inquisition into men's thoughts, nor to punish any mlan merely for
his religion. It can have no power to make a religion for men, since
that would be to dethrone the Almighty. I presume it will not be
arrogated, on the part of the British Legislature, that his Majesty, by
and. with the advice of the Lords spiritual and temporal, &amp;c., can
enact that he will appoint and constitute a new religion for the People of this empire; or, that, by an order in Council, the consciences
and creeds of his subjects might be suspended. Nor will it be contended, I apprehend, that any authoritative or legislative measure
could alter the law of the hypothenuse.  Whatever belongs to the
authority of God, or to the laws of nature, is necessarily beyond the
province and sphere of human institution and government.  The
Pboman Catholic, when you disqualify him on the ground of his religion, may, with great justice, tell you that you are not his God, that
he cannot mould or fashion his faith by your decrees. When once
man goes out of his sphere, and says he will legislate for God, he
would, in fact, make himself God.
But this I do not charge upon the Parliament, because, in none of
the penal acts, has the Parliament imposed a religious creed. The
qualifjing oath, as to the great number of offices, and as to seats in
20SENATORIAL. - GRATTAN.                     ~!
Parliaments, scrupulously evades religious distinctions.  A Dissenter
of any class may take it. A Deist, an Atheist, may likewise take it.
The Catholics are alone excepted; and for what reason? If a Deist
be fit to sit in Parliament, it can hardly be urged that a Christian is
unfit! If an Atheist be competent to legislate for his country, surely
this prlivilege cannot be denied to the believer in the divinity of our
Saviour! If it be contended that, to support the Church, it is. expedien-t to continue these disabilities, I dissent from that opinion.  If it
could, indeed, be proved, I should say that you had acted in defianee
of all the principles of human justice and freedom, in having taken
away their Church from the Irish, in order to establish your own; and
in afterwards attempting to secure that establishment by disqualifying
the People, and compelling them at the same time to pay for its support. This is to fly directly in the face of the plainest canons of the
Almighty. For the benefit of eleven hundred, to disqualify four or
five millions, is the insolent effort of bigotry, not the benignant precept of Christianity; and all this, not for the preservation of their
property,-- for that was secured,- but for bigotry, for intolerance, for
avarice, for a vile, abominable, illegitilmate, and atrocious usurpation.
The laws of God cry out against it; the spirit of Christianity cries
out against it; the laws of England, and the spirit and principles of
its Constitution, cry out against such a system.
73. SECTARIAN TYRANNY, 1812. -Henry Grattan.
W`ENEVER one sect degrades another on account of religion, such
degradation is the tyranny of a sect.  When you enact that, on
account of his religion, no Catholic shall sit in Parliament, you do
what amounts to the tyranny of a sect. When you enact that no
Catholic shall be a sheriff, you do what amounts to the tyranny'of a
sect. When you enact that no Catholic shall be a general, you do
what amounts to the tyranny of a sect. There are two descriptions
of laws, - the municipal law, which binds the People, and the law of
God, which binds the Parliament and the People.  Whenever you do
any act which is contrary to His laws, as expressed in His work, which
is the world, or in His book, the Bible, you exceed your right; whenever you rest any of your establishments on that excess, you rest it on
a foundation which is weak and fallacious; whenever you attempt to
establish your Government, or your property, or your Church, on
religious restrictions, you establish them on that false foundation, atd
you oppose the Almighty; and though you had a host of mitres on
your side, you banish God from your ecclesiastical Constitution, and
freedom from your political. In vain shall men endeavor to make
this the cause of the Church; they aggravate the crime, by the
endeavor to make their God their fellow in the injustice.  Such rights.
are the rights of ambition; they are the rights of conquest; anr. in
your case, they have been the rights of suicide. They begin Ly
attacking liberty; they end by the loss of empire!iL 2

74. TIHE AMERICAN WAR DENOUNCED, 1781. --    illiam Pitt.
Williaul Pitt, second son of the great Earl of Chatham, entered Parliament in hio twenty
second year. IHe was born the 28th of May, 1759; and took his seat in the House of Commons,
ts representative for the borough of Appleby, on the 23d of January, 1781. He made his first
oratorical effort in that body the 26th of February following; and displayed great and astonishing powers of eloquence. Burke said of him, " He is not merely a chip of the old block, but he
is the old block itself." At the age of twenty-four, Pitt became the virtual leader of the House
of Commons, and Prime Minister of England. IIe died January 23, 1806. The subjoined
remarks were made in reference to a resolution declaring that ilmnediate measures ought to be
adopted for concluding peace with the American Coloeiies.
GENTLEMEN have passed the highest eulogiums on the American war.
Its justice has been defended in the most fervent manner.      A noble
Lord, in the heat of his zeal, has called it a holy war.     For my part,
although the honorable Gentleman who made this motion, and some
other Gentlemen, have been, more than once, in the course of thle debate,
severely reprehended for calling it a wicked and accursed war, I am
persuaded, and would affirm, that it was a most accursed, wicked,
barbarous, cruel, unnatural, unjust and diabolical war!       It was conceived in injustice; it was nurtured and brought forth in folly; its
footsteps were marked with blood, slaughter, persecution and devastation; -in truth, everything which went to constitute moral depravity'and human turpitude were to be found in it.      It was pregnant with
misery of every kind.
se mischief, however, recoiled on the unhappy People of this
countrv, who were made the instruments by which the wicked purposes
of the authors of the war were effected. The Nation was drained of
its best blood, and of its vital resources of men    and money.     The
expense of the war was enormous, -    much beyond any former experience. And yet, what has the British Nation received in return?
Nothing but a series of ineffective victories, or severe defeats;-- victories celebrated only by a temporary triumph over our brethren,:whom  we would trample down and destroy; victories, which filled the
land with mourning for the loss of dear and valued relatives, slain in
the impious cause of enforcing unconditional submission, or with narratives of the glorious exertions of men struggling in the holy cause
of liberty, though struggling in the absence of all the facilities and
advantages which are in general deemed the necessary concomitants of
victory and success.  Where was the Englishman, whlo, on reading the
narratives of those bloody and well-fought contests, could refrain from
lamenting the loss of so much British blood spilt in such a cause; or
firom weeping, on whatever side victory might be declared?
75. ON A MOTION TO CENSURE THE MIINISTRY. - Villiam Pitt.
This roble and dignified reply to the animadversions of Mr Fox was made in 1783, wheu
5ir. Pitt, then Prime Minister, was only twenty-four years old.
SiR, revering, as I do, the great abilities of the honorable Gentleman
who spoke last, I lament, in common with the House, when those
abilities are misemployed, as on the present question, to inflame the
imagination, and mislead the judgment.     I am told, Sir, " he does notSENATORIAL. - PITT.
mvy me the triumph of my situation on this day;" a sort or language
which becomes the candor of that hoerueable Gentleman as ill as his
present principles. The triumphs of party, Sir, with which this selfappcinted Minister seems so highly elate, shall never seduce me to any
inconsistency which the busiest suspicion shall presume to glance at.
I will never engage in political enmities without a public cause. I
will never forego such enmities without the public approbation; nor
will I be questioned and cast off in the face of the House, by one virtuous and dissatisfied friend. These, Sir, the sober and durable
triumphs of reason over the weak and profligate incoinsistencies of party
violence,- these, Sir, the steady triumphs of virtue over success itself,
--shall be mine, not onlly in my present situation, but through every
future condition of my life; triumphs which no length of time shall
diminish, which no change of principles shall ever sully.
My own share in the censure pointed by the motion before the
House against his Majesty's MIinisters I will bear with fortitude,
because my own heart tells me I have not acted wrong.      To this
monitor, who never did, and, I trust, never will, deceive me, I will
confidently repair, as to an adequate asylum from all the clamor which
interested faction can raise. I was not very eager to come in; and
shall have no great reluctance to go out, whenever the public are
disposed to dismiss me from their service.  It is impossible to deprive
me of those feelings which must always spring from the sincerity of my
endeavors to fulfil with integrity every official engagement.  You may
take from me, Sir, the privileges and emoluments of place; but you cannot, and you shall not, take from me those habitual and warm regards for
the prosperity of my country, which constitute the honor, the happiness,
the pride of my life; and which, I trust, death alone can extinguish.
And, with this consolation, the loss of power, Sir, and the loss of
fortune, though I affect not to despise them, I hope I soon shall be
able to forget:

Certain resolutions were passed by the House, in 1784, for the removal of his Majesty's milisters, at the head of whom was Mr. Pitt. These resolutions, however, his Majesty had not
thought proper to comply with. A reference having been made to them, Blr. Pitt spoke as
follows, in reply to Mr. Fox.
CAN anything that I have said, Mr. Speaker, subject me to be
branded with the imputation of preferring my personal situation to
the public happiness?  Sir, I have declared, again and again, Only
prove to me that there is any reasonable hope - show me but the
most distant prospect- that my resignation will at all contribute to
restore peace and happiness to the country, and I will instantly resign.
But, Sir, I declare, at t/me same time, I will not be indluced to resign

ks a pieliminary to negotiation.  I will not abandon this situation, in
order to throw myself upon the mercy of that right honorable gentle
man. Ile calh, me now a mere nominal minister, the mere puppet of
secret influence. Sir, it is because I will not become a mere nominal
minister of his creation, - it is because I disdain to become the puppet
of that right honorable gentleman, -that I will not resign; neither
shall his contemptuous expressions provoke me to resignation: my
own honor and reputation I never will resign.
Let this House beware of suffering any individual to involve his
own cause, and to interweave his own interests, in the resolutions of
the House of Commons.     The dignity of the House is forever
appealed to. Let us beware that it is not the dignity of any set of
men.   Let us beware that personal prejudices have no share in
deciding these great constitutional questiols. The right honorable
gentleman is possessed of those enchanting arts whereby he can give
grace to deformity. He holds before your eyes a beautiful and delu.
sive image; he pushes it forward to your observation; but, as sure as
you embrace it, the pleasing vision will vanish, and this fair phantom
of liberty will be succeeded by anarchy, confusion, and ruin to the
Constitution. For, in truth, Sir, if the constitutional independence of
the Crown is thus reduced to the very verge of annihilation,,where is
the boasted equipoise of the Constitution?  Dreadrul, therefore, as
the conflict is, my.cons ience, my duty, my fixed regard for the Constitution of our ancestors, maintain me still in this arduous situation.
It is not any proud contempt, or defiance of the constitutional resolutions of this House, --it is no personal poillt of honor, - much less is it
any lust of power, that makes me still cling to office. The situation
of the tinles requires of me -and, I will add, the country calls
aloud to me - that I should defend this castle; and I am determined,
therefore, I WILL defend it!'i7. BARBARISM OF Oun BRITISI ANCESTORS. -Id.
THERE was a time, Sir, which it may be fit sometimes to revive in
the remembrance of our countrymen, when even hunman sacrifices are
said to have been offered in this island. The very practice of the
slave-trade once prevailed among us. Slaves were formerly an established article of our exports.  Great numbers were exported, like
cattle from the British coast, and were to be seen exposed for sale in
the ]oman market. The circumstances that furnished the alleged
proofi that Africa labors under a natural incapacity for civilization
inight also have been asserted of ancient and uncivilized Britain.
Wrhy might not some Roman Senator, reasoning upon the principles
of some honorable members of this House, and pointing to British
barbarians, have predicted, with equal boldness, " There is a People
that will never rise to civilization! -- There is a People destined never
to be fiee! "SENATORIAL. - FOX.
We Sir, have long since emerged from      barbarism, we have almost
brgotten that we were once barbarians; we are now raised to a situation which exhibits a striking contrast to every circumstance by
which a Roman might have characterized us, and by which we now
characterize Africa. There is, indeed, one thing wanting to complete
the contrast, and to clear us altogether from the imputation of acting,
even to this hour, as barbarians; for we continue to this hour a bar.
barous traffic in slaves, - we continue it even yet, in spite of all our
great and undeniable pretensions to civilization.     We were once as
obscure among the Nations of the earth, as savage in our manners, as
debased in our morals, as degraded in our understandings, as these
unhappy Africans are at present.     But, in the lapse of a long series
of years, by a progression slow, anld, for a time, almost imperceptible,
we have become rich in a variety of acquirements, favored above
measure in the gifts of Providence, unrivalled in commerce, preeminent in arts, foremost in the pursuits of philosophy and science, and
established in all the blessings of civil society.      From   all these
blessings we must forever have been shut out, had there been any
truth in those principles which some gentlemen have not hesitated to
lay down as applicable to the case of Africa.     Had those principles
been true, we ourselves had languished to this hour in that miserable
state of ignorance, brutality and degradation, in which history proves
our ancestors to have been imimersed.  Had other Natioris adopted these
principles in their conduct towards us, had other Nations applied to
Great Britain the reasoning which some of the Senators of this very
island now apply to Africa, ages might have passed without our
emerging from   barbarism; and we, who are enjoying the blessings of
British liberty, might, at this hour, have been little superior, eithe
in morals, in knowledge, or refinement, to the rude inhabitants of
the Coast of Guinea.
78. IESUIJLTS OF THE AMERICAN WAR, 1780. -Charles James Foex.
Charles Janmes Fox was born in England, on the 24th of January, 1749. He made his first
speech in Parlliament on the 15th of April, 1769. In the style of his oratory he has been com
pared, by some critics, to Demosthenes. " A certain sincerity and open-heartedness of manner; an apparently entire and thorough conviction of being in the right; an abrupt tone
of vehemence and indignation; a steadfast love of freedom, and corresponding hatred of
oppression in all its forms; a natural and idiomatic style, - vigor, argument, power, - these
were characteristics equally of the Greek and English orator." Fox died on the 13th September, 1806, in the fifty-eighth year of his age.
WE are ch'arged with expressing joy at the triumphs of America.
True it is that, in a former session, I proclaimned it as my sincere
opinion, that if the Ministry had succeeded in their first scheme on
the liberties of America, the liberties of this country would have been
at an end.   Thinking this, as I did, in the sincerity of an honest
heart, I rejoiced at the resistance which the Miinistry had met to their
attempt.   That great and glorious statesman, the late Earl of Chat.

America had    resisted.  But, it seems, " all the calamities of the;Z35THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
country are to be ascribed to the wishes, and the joy, and the speeches.
of Opposition."  O, miserable and unfortunate Ministry!  0, blind
and incapable men! whose measures are framed with so little foresight,'and executed with so little firmness, that they not only crumble
to pieces, but bring on the ruin of their country, merely because one
rash, weak, or wicked man, in the House of Commons, nlakes a speech
against them!
But who is he who arraigns gentlemen on this side of the Housl
with causing, by their inflammatory speeches, the misfortunes of their
country?   The accusation comes from   one whose inflanmmatory
harangues have led the Nation, step by step, fiomn violence to violence,
in that inhuman, unfeeling system of blood and massacre, which every
honest man must detest, which every good man must abhor, and every
wise man condemn! And this man imputes the guilt of such measures to those who had all along foretold the consequenlces; who had
prayed, entreated and supplicated, not only for America, but for the
credit of the Nation and its eventual wei-lfare, to arrest the hand of
Power, meditating slaughter, and directed by injustice!
What was the consequence of the sanguinary measures recommended
in those bloody, inflammatory speeches?  Though Boston was to be
starved, though Hancock and Adalns were proscribed, yet at the feet of
these very men the Parliament of Great Britain Was obliged to kneel,
flatter, and cringe; and, as it had the cruelty at one time to denounce
vengeance against these men, so it had the meanness afterwacrds to
implore their forgiveness.  Shall he who called the Americans " Hancock and his crew," -shall he presume to reprehend any set of men
for inflammatory speeches?  It is this accursed American war that
has led us, step by step, into all our present misfortunes and' national
disgraces. What was the cause of our wasting forty millions of money,
and sixty thousand lives?  The American war!  What was it that
produced the French rescript and a French war?   The American
war! What was it that produced the Spanisb manifesto and Spanish
war? The Amlerican war! What was it that armed forty-two
thousand men in Ireland with the arguments carried on the points
of forty thousand bayonets? The American war! For what are we
about to incur an additional debt of twelve or fourteen mfillions?
This accursed, cruel, diabolical American war!
79, THE FOREIGN POLICY OF WASHINGTON, 1794. - Charles James For.
How infinitely superior must appear the spirit and principles of
General iWashington, in his late address to Congress, compared with
the policy of modern European Courts! Illustrious man! - deriving
honor less from the splendor of his situation than from the dignity of
his mind! Grateful to France for the assistance received from her, in
that great contest which secured the independence of America,.he yet
did not choose to give up the system of neutrality in her favor. Having once laid dowin he line of conduct most proper to be pursued, notail the insults and provocations of the French nr nister, Genet,* could
at all put him out of his way, or bend him from his purpose. It must,
indeed, create astonishment, that, placed in circumstances so critical.
and filling a station so conspicuous, the character of Washington should
never once have been called in question; - that he shcald, in no one
instance, have been accused either of improper insolence, or of mean
submission, in his transactions with foreign Nations.  It has been
reserved for him to run the race of glory without experiencing the
smallest interruption to the brilliancy of his career. The breath of
censure has not dared to impeach the purity of his conduct, nor the
eye of envy to raise its malignant glance to the elevation of his virtues.
Such has been the transcendent merit and the unparalleled fate of this
illustrious man!
How did he act when insulted by Genet? Did he consider it as necessary to avenge himself for the misconduct or madness of an individual,
by involving a whole continent in the horrors of war? No; he contented himself with procuring satisfaction for the insult, by causing
Genet to be recalled; and thus, at once, consulted his own dignity and
the interests of his country.  Happy Americans! while the whirlwind
flies over one quarter of the globe, and spreads everywhere desolation,
you remain protected from its baneful effects by your own virtues,
and the wisdom of your Government.  Separated from Europe by an
immense ocean, you feel not the effect of those prejudices and passions
which convert the boasted seats of civilization into scenes of horror and
bloodshed.  You profit by the folly and madness of the contending
Nations, and afford, in your more congenial clime, an asylum to those
blessings and virtues which they wantonly contemn, or wickedly
exclude from their bosom! Cultivating the arts of peace under the
influence of freedom, you advance, by rapid strides, to opulence and'distinction; and if, by any accident, you should be compelled to take
part in the present unhappy contest, - if you should find it necessary to
avenge insult, or repel injury, - the world will bear witness to the equity
of your sentiments and the moderation of your views; and the success
of your arms will, no doubt, be proportioned to the' justice of your
cause!
80. LIBERTY IS STRENGTII. - Fox 1797, on the State of Ireland.

re&amp;aced to six, called Phrases of Melody. These are the Monotone, the Risinl
and Falling Ditone, the Rising and Falling Tritone, and the Alternate  Phrase.
By a more careful analysis, we ascertain that some of the simpler styles of
delivery take their character from the predominance of some one of these phra,se.
of melody. Thus we have the Diatonic Melody, the Melody of the Monotone, 0f
the Alternate Phrase, and of the Cadence; and to these are added the Chro.
matic Melody which arises from the predominance of the Semitone, and thf'rcken Melody.
INSUFFICIENCY OF ARBITRARY SYSTEMS OF ELOCUTION.
It would be impossible, in the space we have given to the subject, to do justice to any one of these ingenious analyses; and it would be quite unrprofitable
to enumerate the many systems that have been deduced from them up to the
present time. The important question is, Do they establish, severally or collect.
ively, a positive science of elocution, which will justify the pupil in laboring
to master it in its details, and to accomplish himself according to its rules of
practice?  We believe there are very few students, who have given much
time and attention to the subject, who will not render a negative reply. The
shades of expression in language are often so delicate and undistinguishable,
that intonation will inevitably vary according to the temperamnent of the
speaker, his appreciation of the sense, and the intensity with which he enters
into the spirit of what he utters.  It is impossible to establish rules of mathematical precision for utterance, any more than for dancing. Take the first line
of Mark Antony's harangue:
Friends, Ronans, countrymen, lend me your ears!
An ingenious speaker will give, at one time, the falling inflection, and at
another the rising, to the word countrymen; and both   modes shall seem
equally expressive and appropriate.  Nay, he will at one moment place the
chief stress upon lend, and the next upon ears; and he will make either mode
of rendering the verse appear appropriate and expressive. We do not deny
that there are passages in regard to which there can be little doubt as to the
inflection and emphasis to be employed; but these are precisely the passages
in reference to which rules are not needed, so obvious is the sense to every
intelligent reader, and so unerringly does nature guide us.
"Probably not a single instance," says Archbishop Wlhately, " could be
found, of any one who has attained, by the study of anly system of instruction
that has appeared, a really good delivery; but there are many -probably
nearly as many as have fully tried the experiment - who have by this means
been totally spoiledcl." There is one principle, he says, radically erroneous,
which must vitiate every system founded on it, - the principle, "that, in
order to acquire the best style of delivery, it is requisite to study analytically the emphasis, tones, pauses, degrees of loudness,'c., which give the
proper effect to each passage that is well delivered; to firame Rules founded on
the observation of these; and then, in practice, deliberately and carefully to
conform the utterance to these rules, so as to form a complete artificial system
of Elocution."  "To the adoption of any such artificial scheme there are
three weighty objections: first, that the proposed system must necessarily be
imperfect; secondly, that if it were perfect, it would be a circuitous path to
the -object in view; and thirdly, that even if both these objections were
removed, the object would not be effectually obtained."
The first of those objections, which is not denied by the most strenuous
advocates of the artificial systems, would seem to be all-sufficient. Any number
of Rules must needs leave the subject incomplete, inasmuch as the analysis of
sentences, in their structure, and their relations to vocal inflection, mnay be
carried to almnost any extent. Few Rules can be laid down to which many
unforeseen exceptions cannot be made. Mr. Walker, in his "Rhetorica

na their Government: but that, in a moment of war and calamity, --of
distrust and misconduct, - it is not permitted to meet together; because
then, instead of eulogizing, they might think proper to condernn Minis
ters. What a mockery is this!  What an instlt, to say that this is
preserving to the People the right of petition! To tell them that they
shall have a right to applaud, a right to rejoice, a right to meet when
they are happy; but not a right to condemn, not a right to deplore
their misfortunes, not a right to suggest a remedy!
Liberty is order. Liberty is strength.  Look rouncl the world, and
admire, as you must, the instructive spectacle.  You will see that
liberty not only is power and order, but that it is power and order predominant and invincible, - that it derides a11 other sources of strength
And shall the preposterous imagination be fostered, that men' bred in
liberty -the first of human kind who asserted the glorious distinction
of fornming for themselves their social compact-- can be condemned to
silence upon their'rights? Is it to be conceived that men, who have
enjoyed, for such a length of days, the light.and happiness of freedom,
can be restrained, and shut up again in the gloorm of ignorance and
degraclation?  As well, Sir, might you try, by a miserable dam, to
shut up the flowing of a rapid river! The rolling and impetuous tide
would burst through every impediment that man might throw in its
way; and the only consequence of the impotent attempt would be, that,
having collected new force by its temporary suspension, enforcing
itself through new channels, it would spread devastation and ruin on
every side. The progress of liberty is like the progress of the stream.
Kept within its bounds, it is sure to fertilize the country through
which it runs; but no power call arrest it in its passage; and shortsighted, as well as wicked, must be the heart of the projector that
would strive to divert its course.
81. VIGOR OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMIENTS, 1797.- Charles James Fox.
WIHEN we look at the Democracies of the ancient world, we are comlled to acknowledge their oppressions to their dependencies; their
horrible acts of injustice and of ingratitude to their own citizens; but
they compel us, also, to admiration, by their vigor, their constancy,
their spirit, and their exertions, in every great emergency in which
they were called upon to act. We are compelled to own that the
democratic form of government gives a power of which no other form
is capable. Why?    Because it incorporates every man with the
State. Because it arouses everything that belongs to the soul, as well
as to the body, of man. Because it makes every individual feel that
he is fighting for himself; that it is his own cause, his own safety, his
own dignity, on the face of the earth, that he is asserting.  Who, that
reads the history of the Persian War, - what boy, whose heart i;
warmed by the grand and sublime actions which the democratic spirit
produced, - does not find, in this principle, the key to all the wonders
which were, achieved at Thermopyhe and elsewhere, and of which theSENATORIAL. - FOX.

82. TIIE PARTITION OF POLAND, 1800. - Charles James Fox.
Now, Sir, what was the conduct of your own allies to Poland? Is
there a single atrocity of the French in Italy, in Switzerland, in Egypt,
if you please, more unprincipled and inhuman than that of Russia, Austria and Prussia, in Poland? What has there been in the conduct of

the subdued victims of their rage in any district which they have over.

confirmed the atrocity. But they are your allies; and ihough they
overran and divided Poland, there was nothing, perhaps, in the manner
of doing it, which stamped it with peculiar infamy and disgrace. The
hero of Poland, perhaps, was merciful and mild! He was " as much
superior to Bonaparte in bravery, and in the discipline which he maintained, as he was superior in virtue and humanity! He was animated
by the purest principles of Christianity, and was restrained in his
carcer by the benevolent precepts which it inculcates! "  Was he?

stitution, which had been confessed, by their own sovereign, to be in
want of amendedment. And such is the hero upon whom the cause of' religion and social order " is to repose! And such is the man whom
we praise for his discipline and his virtue, and whom we hold out as
our boast and our dependence; while the conduct of Bonaparte unfits
him to be even treated with as an enemy!
83. AN ATHEISTICAL GOVERNMENT IMPOSSIBLE, 1794. -R. B. Sheridan.
Richard B3rinsley Sheridan was born in Dublin, September, 1751, and died July 7, 1816, in
LoncIon. I-e distinguished himself greatly, in company with Burke, in the prosecution against
Warren Hastings i but the reports of his speeches at the trial are imperfect and conflicting.
Sheridan's fame as a dramatist is quite equal to his Parliamentary reputation.
TItE noble Lord's purpose is to prove that France began the war
with Great Britain.  This he appears to think he has established, the
moment he has shown that Brissot * and others have promulgated in
print a great many foolish and a great many wicked general principles,
mischievous to all established Governments.  But what was the sum
of all that the noble Lord told the House?  What did it all prove?
~What, but that eternal and unalterable truth, that a long-established
despotism so far degraded and debased human nature, as to render its
aubjects, on the first recovery of their rights, unfit for the exercise of
them; but never have I, or will I, meet, but with reprobation, that
muode of argument whichn goes, in fact, to establish, as an inference from
mnis truth, that those who have been long slaves ought, therefore, to
relrain so forever.
It is contended that the present state of things in France canmot
stand.  Without disputing any of his premises, for the present, I will
grant the noble Lord not only his principle, but the foundation upon
which he builds it.  I agree with him, that it is contrary to the eternal and unalterable laws of Nature, and to the decrees of the lIaker of
man and of Nations, that a Government, founded on and maintained
by injustice, rapine, murder and atheism, can have a fixed endurance
~r a permanent success; that there are, self-sown in its ownbosom, the
seeds of its own inevitable dissolution.  B[ut if so, whence is our mission to become tlle destroying angel to guide and hasten the anger of
thae Deity?  Who calls on us to offer, vith more than mortal arrogance, the alliance of a mortal arnm to the Omnipotent?.or to snatch
the uplifted thunder from His hand, and point our erring aim at the
devoted f:bric which His original will has fated to fall and crumble in
ttiat ruin which it is not in the mneans of man to accelerate or prevent?
I accede to the noble Lord the piety of his principle: let him accede
to me the justice of my conclusion; or let him'attend to experience,
if not to reason; and must he not admit that hitherto all the attempts
of hiz 9-,narentlv powerful, but certainly presumptuous, crusade of
vengeance, nave appeared unfavored by fortune and by Providence;
that they have hitherto had no other effect than to strengthen the
powers, to whet the rapacity, to harden the heart, to inflame the fury.

we have rashly sworn to subdue, to chastise, and to reform 2

84 AGAINST POLITICAL JOBBING, 1794.--R. B. Sheridan.
Is this A time for selfish intrigues, and the little dirty traffic for
ucre and emolument? Does it suit the honor of a gentleman to ask
at such a moment?    Does it become the honesty of a minister to
grant? VWhat! in such an hour as this, - at a moment pregnant with
the national fate, when, pressing as the exigency may be, the hard
task of squeezing the money from the pockets of an impoverished
People, from the toil, the drudgery of the sl{ivering poor, must make
the most practised collector's heart ache while he tears it from them,
- can it be that people of high rank, and professing high principles,
--that they or their families should seek to thrive on the spoils of
misery, and fatten on the meals wrested from industrious poverty?
O, shame! shame! Is it intended to confirm the pernicious doctrine
so industriously propagated, that all public men are impostors, and
that every politician has his price? Or, even where there is no principle in the bosom, why does not prudence hint to the mercenary and
the vain to abstain a while, at least, and wait the fitting of the timnes?
Improvident impatience!  Nay, even from those who seen to have
no direct object of office or profit, what is the language which their
actions speak?
"The Throne is in danger! we will support the Throne; but let us

uindaunted champion in its cause than I shall prove!" " Stain my
green ribbon blue," cries out the illustrious Knight, "and the fountain
of honor will have a fast and fhithful servant!"
What are the People to think of our sincerity? What credit are
they to give to our professions?  Is this system to be persevered in?:
Is there nothing that whispers to that right honorable gentleman that
the crisis is too big, that the times are too gigantic, to be ruled by the
little hackneyed and every-day mneans of ordinary corruption?  Or,
are we to believe that he has witlin himself a conscious feeling that
disqualifies him from rebuking the ill-timed selfishness of his new
allies?  Let him take care that the corruptions of the Government,
shall not have lost it the public heart; that the example of selfishness
in the fw has not extinguished public spirit in the many/!
85. POPULAR AND KINGLY EXAMPLES, 1795.--R. B. Sheridan.
WE are told to look to the example of France.  From the excesses
of the French People in the French Revolution, we are warned against
giving too much liberty to our own. It is reechoed from every qutarter, and by every description of persons in office, from the Prime
Minister to the exciseman, -  "Look to the example of France! "
The implication is a libel upon the character of Great Britain.  I
will not admit the inference or the argument, that, because a Peopio,

bred under a proud, insolent and grinding despotism, -maddened by
the recollection of former injuries, and madcle savage by the observation
of former cruelties, -a People in whose minds no sincere respect for
property or law ever could have existed, because property had never
been secured to them, and law had never protected them, - that the
actions of such a People, at any time, much less in the ho ir of frenzy
and fury, should furnish an inference or ground on which to estimrate
the temper, character or feelings, of the People of Great Britain.
AVhat answer would gentlemen give, if a person, affectedly or sincerely anxious for the preservation of British liberty, were to say.' Britons, abridge the power of your Monarch; restrain the exercise
of his just prerogative; withhold all power and resources from his
government, or even send him to' his Electorate, from whence your
voice exalted him; -for, mark what has been doing on the Continent!
Look to the exanmple of Kings!  Kings, believe me, are the same in
nature and temper everywhere. Trust yours no longer; see how that
shameless and perfidious despot of Prussia, that trickster and tyrant,
has violated every principle of truth, honor and humanity, in his murderous though impotent attempt at plunder and robbery in Poland!
He who had encouraged and even guaranteed to them their Constitution,--see him, with a scandalous profanation of the resources which he
had wrung by fraud from the credulity of Great Britaini, trampling on
the independence he was pledged to maintain, and seizing for himself
the countries he had sworn to protect!  Mark the still more sanguinary efforts of the despot of Russia, faithless not to us only, and the
cause of Europe, as it is called, but craftily outwitting her perjured
coadjutor, profiting by his disgrace, and grasping to herself the victirm
which had been destined to glut their joint rapacity. See her thanking her favorite General, Suwarrow, and, still more impious, thanking
Heaven for the opportunity; thanking him for the most iniquitous act
of cruelty the bloody page of history records, - the murderous scene
at Praga, where, not in the heat and fury of action, not in the first
impatience of revenge, but after a cold, deliberate pause of ten hours,
with temperate barbarity, he ordered a considerate, methodical massacre
of ten thousand men, women and children! These are the actions of
monarchs! Look to the example of Iings! "

House to show that they are not the real representatives of the People;
I am aware that the question has been formerly agitated, on different
occasions, by great and able characters, who have deserted the cause
from despair of success; and I am aware that I must necessarily go
into what may perhaps be supposed trite and worn-out arguments.  I
come forward on the present occasion, actuated solely by a sense of
duty, to make a serious and important mlotion, which, I am rea dy fairly

to admit, involves no less a consideration than a fundamental change in
the Government.   At the Revolution, the necessity of short Parliaments was asserted; and every departure from these principles is, in
some shape, a departure from the spirit and practice of the Constitution; yet, when they are compared with the present state of the representation, how does the matter stand?  Are the elections free? or
are Parliaments free?  Has not the patronage of peers increased? Is
not the patronage of India now vested in the Crown? Are all these
innovations to be made in order to increase the influence of the Executive power, and is nothing to be done in favor of the popular part of
the Constitution, to act as a counterpoise?
It may be said that the House of Commons are really a just representation of the People, because, on great emergencies, they never fail
to speak the sense of the People, as was the case in the American war,
and in the Russian armament; but, had the House of Commons had a
real representation of the People, they would have interfered sooner
on these occasions, without the necessity of being called upon to do so.
I fear much that this House is not a real representation of the People,
and that it is too much influenced by passion, prejudice or interest.
This may, for a time, give to the Executive Government apparent
strength; but no Government can be either lasting or free which is
not founded on virtue, and on that independence of mind and conduct
among the People which creates energy, and leads to everything that
is noble and generous, or that can conduce to the strength and safety
of a State.
" What constitutes a State 1
Not high-raised battlement or labored mound,
Thick wall, or moated gate;
Not cities proud, with spires and turrets crowned;
Not bays and broad-armed ports,
Where, laughing at the storm, proud navies ride;
Nor starred and spangled courts,
Where low-browed Baseness wafts perfume to Pride!
No! men, high-minded- men,
With powers as far above dull brutes endued,
In forest, brake or den,
As beasts excel cold rocks and brambles rude; -
Men who their duties know,
But know their rights, and, knowing, dare maintain." *

I HAVE been charged with being the author in some instances, and

T deny the charge. I dare the authors of it to the proof.. Gentlemen,
when they talk of innovation, ought to remember, with Lord Bacon,

243THE STANDARD SIBEAKER.
Time has raised these great interests, and it is the business of a stlates
man to move onwards with the new        combinations which    have grown
around him.     This, Sir, is the principle by which my feelings have
been constantly regulated, during a long public life; and by which I
shall continue to be governed, so loing as I take any part in the publio
affairs of this country. It is well said, by the most poetical geniLs,
perhtps, of our own times, -
"A thousand years scarce serve to form a State, ---
An hour may lay it in the dust."
I his is the feeling which has regulated, which will continue to regr
ulate, my conduct.    I am  no advocate for changes upon mere abstract
theory.   I know not, indeed, which is the greater folly, that of resisting all improvement, because inmprovement implies innovation, or that
of referring  everything to first principles, and to abstract do&amp;trines.
The business of the practical man is, to make himself acquainted with
facts; to watch events; to understand the actual situation of affairs
and the course of time and circumstances, as bearing upon the present
state of his own country and the world.      These are the grounds by a
reference to which his reasonl and judgment must be formed; according to which, without losing sight of first principles, he must know
how  to apply them, and to temper their inflexibility.         This is the
task of practical legislation.
88. SATIRE ON THE PENSION SYSTEM, 1786.--Curran.
John Philpot Curran was born in Newcastle, Ireland, July 24th, 1750. His Senratorial
career was confined to the Irish Parliament, and was entirely eclipsed by his reputation at the
bar. "There never lived a greater advocate," says Charles Phillips; "certainly never one
more suited to the country in which his lot was cast. His eloquence was copious, rapid and
ornate, and his powers of mimicry beyond all description." In his boyhood he had a confusion
in his utterance, from whichi he was called by his school-fellows "stuttering Jack Curran." He
employed every means to correct his elocution, and render it perfect. " lIe accustomed himself," says one of his biographers, "to speak very slowly, to correct his precipitate utteranice. lie
practised before a glass, to make his gestures gracefLil. He spoke aloud the most celebrated
orations. Onlle piece,-the speech of Antony over the dead body of Cesar,-he was never weary
of repeating. This he recommended to his young friends at the bar, as a model of eloquence.
Anid while he thus used art to smooth a channel for his thoughts to flowv in, no man's eloquenlce
ver issued more freshly and spontaneously from the heart. It was always the heart of the man
that spoke." Under our Forensic department several choice specimens of Curran's speeches
will be found. Curran died October 14th, 1817.
THIs polyglot of wealth, this museum        of curiosities, the Pension
LLst, embraces every link in the human chain, every description of men,
women   and   children, from  the exalted   excellence of a Hawke or a
Rodney, to the debased situation of the lady who humbleth herself that
she may be exalted.     But the lessons it inculcates form     its greatest
perfection: It teacheth, that Sloth and Vice may eat that bread which
Virtue and Honesty may starve for after they have earned it. It
teaches the idle and dissolute to look up for that support which they
are too proud to stoop and earn. It directs the minds of men to an
entire reliance on the ruling Power of the State, who feeds the ravens
of the Royal aviary, that cry continually for food.         It teaches them   to

Solcmon in his glory. In fine, it teaches a lesson, which, indeed, they
might have learned from Epict6tus, that it is sometimes good not to be
over-virtu6us; it shows, that, in proportion as our distresses increase,
the munificence of the Crown increases also; in proportion as our
clothes are rent, the royal mantle is extended over us.
Notwithstanding thlat the Pension List, like charity, covers a nmultitude of sins, give mle leave to consider it as coming home to the nr;em.

the independence of Parliament; for, hereafter, instead of orators or
patriots accounting for their conduct to such mean and unworthy
persons as freeholders, they will lealrn to despise them, and look to the
first man in the State; and they will, by so doing, have this security
for their independence, - that while any man in the Kingdom has a
shilling, they will not want one!
89. REPLY TO THREATS O0' VIOLENCE, 1790.--Curran.
WE have been told this night, in express words, that the man who
dares to do his duty to his country in this House may expect to be
attacked without these walls by the military gentlemen of the Castle.
If the army had been directly or indirectly mentioned in the course
of the debate, this extraordinary declaration might be attributable to
the confusion of a mistaken charge, or an absurd vindication; but.
without connection with the subject, a new principle of government is
advanced, and that is - the bayonet! And this is stated in the fullest house, and the most crowded audience, I ever saw. We are to be
silenced; by corruption within, or quelled by force of arms without. If
the strength of numbers or corruption should fail against the cause of
the public, it is to be backed by assassination.  Nor is it necessary
that those avowed principles of bribery and arms should come from
any high personal authority; they have been delivered by the known
retainers of Administration, in the face of that bench, and heard even
without a murmur of dissent or disapprobation.
l or my p.rt, I do not know how it may be my destiny to fall; - it
nlay be by chance, or malady, or violence; but, should it be my fate
to perish the victim of a bold and honest discharge of my duty, I will
not shun it.  I will do that duty; and, if it should expose me to sink
under the blow of the assassin, and become a victim to the public
cause, the most sensible of my regrets would be, that on such an altar
there should not be immolated a more illustrious sacrifice.  As to
myself, while I live, I shall despise the peril. I feel in my own spirit
the safety of my honor, and in my own and the spirit of the People
ao I feel strength enough to hold that Administration, which can give
a sanction to menaces like these, responsible for their consequences to
the Nation and the individual.
245TILE STANDARD SPEAKER.
90. AGAINST RELIGIOUS DISTINCTIONS, 1796. -Curran.
GENTLEMEN say the Catholics have got everything but seats in
Parliament.   Are we really afraid of giving them    that privilege?
Are we seriously afraid that Catholic venality might pollute the
immaculate integrity of the House of Commons? - that a Catholic
member would be more accessible to a promise, or a pension, or a bribe
than a Protestant?   Lay your hands upon your hearts, look in one
another's faces, and say Yes, and I will vote against this amendment'
But is- it the fact that they have everything?   Is it the fact that
they have the common benefit of the Constitution, or the common protection of the law?
Another gentleman has said, the Catholics have got much, and
ought to be content.   Why have they got that much?      Is it from
the minister? Is it from the Parliament, which threw their petition
over its bar?  No, -  they got it by the great revolution of human
affairs; by the astonishing march of the human mind; a march that
has collected too much momentum, in its advance, to be now stopped
in its progress. The bark is still afloat; it is freighted with the hopes
and liberties of millions of men; she is already under way; the rower
may faint, or the wind may sleep, but, rely upon it, she has already
acquired an energy of advancement that will support her course, and
bring her to her destination; rely upon it, whether much or little
remains, it is now vain to withhold it; rely upon it, you may as well
stamp your foot upon the earth, in order to prevent its revolution.
You cannot stop it!    You will only remain a silly gn5mon upon its
surface, to measure the rapidity of rotation, until yoi, are forced round
and buried in the shade of that body whose irresistible course you
would endeavor to oppose  
91. FRUITS OF TIlE WAR WITH FRANCE.--Geo-rge Cantning.
George Canning was born in London, on the 11th of April, 1770. He entered into public life
the avowed pupil of Mr. Pitt, and made his maiden speech in Parliament, from which the following is an extract, in 11794. lie was repeatedly a member of the Ministry, and became Premier
shortly before his death, which occurred in 1827. Mr. Canning meditated his speeches carefully, and they are models of Parliamentary style. " No English speaker," says Sir James
Mackintosh, " used the keen and brilliant weapon of wit so long, so often, or so eff:'ctively, as
Mr. Canning."
WE have been told that this is a war into which we have been hurried by clamor and prejudice; in short, that it is a war of passion.
An appeal is made to our prudence; and we are asked, with ar air
of triumph, what are we to get by this war?   Sir, that we have still
a Government; that the functions of this House have not been usurped
by a corresponding society, or a Scotch Convention; that, instead of
sitting in debate here, whether or not we shall subsidize the King of
Sardinia, we are not rather employed in devising how to raise a forced
loansfor some proconsular deputy, whom the banditti of Paris might
have sent to receive our contributions;--Sir, that we siti here at all,
tbese are the fruits of the war!
246SENATORIA L. - CANNING.
But, wvhen neither our reason nor our prudence can be set against
the war, an attempt is made to alarm our apprehensions. The French
are stated to be an invincible People; inflamed to a degree of madness
with the holy enthusiasm of freedom, there is nothing that they cannot
accomplish.  I am as ready as any mall to allow that the French are
enthusiastically animated, be it how it may, to a state of absolute
insanity.  I desire no better proof of their being mad, than to see
lhemn hugging themselves in a system of slavery so gross and grinding
as their present, and calling, at the same time, aloud upon all Europe,
to admire and envy their freedom.  But, befbre their plea of madness
can be admitted as conclusive against our right to be at war with
them, Gentlemen would do well to recollect that of madness there are
several kinds. If theirs had been a harmless idiot lunacy, which had
contented itself with playing its tricks and practising its fooleries at
home,- with dressing up shameless women in oak-leaves, and inventing
nick-names for the calendar,  I should have been far from desiring to
interrupt their innocent amusements; we might have looked on with
hearty contempt, indeed, but with a contempt not wholly unmixed
with commiseration. But, if theirs be a madness of a different kind,
--a moody, mischievous insanity, - if, not contented with tearing and
wounding themselves, they proceed to exert their unnatural strength
for the annoyance of their neighbors, - if, not satisfied with weaving
straws and wearing fetters at home, they attempt to carry their systems and their slavery abroad, and to impose them on the Nations of
Europe, - it becomes necessary, then, that those Nations should be
roused to resistance. Such a disposition must, for the safety and peace
of the world, be repelled; and, if possible, be eradicated.
92. BANK-NOTES AND COIN, 1811.- George Canning.
ARE bank-notes equivalent to the legal standard coin of the realm?
This is the question which divides and agitates the public opinion.
Says the right honorable gentleman, " I will devise a mode of settling
this question to the satisfaction of the public."  By advising a proclalmation? No. By bringing a bill into Parliament? No. By proposing to declare the joint opinion of both Houses, or the separate
opinlion of one?  No. By what process, then?  Why, simply by
telling the disputants that they are, and have been all along, howevel
unconsciously, agreed upon the subject of their variance; and gravely
resolving for them, respectively, an unanimous opinion! This is t'he
very judgmeni, I should imagine, which Milton ascribes to the venerable Anarch, whom he represents as adjusting the dsputes of t'e
conflicting element:
"Chaos umpire sits,
And by decision more embroils the fray."
"Ily public estimation," says the right honorable genltleman's Resolutiop "bank-notes and coin are equiv1lent.'"  Indeed! What then
247ARBITRARY SS6TEMS OF ELOCUTV N.                      25
Grammar," publshed some years after his " Elements of &gt;bcutlsc....   had
been before,he public, admits the practical failure of the systen.s fa t elt on
his analysis. "The sanguine expectations I had once entertained," se says,
" that this Analysis of the ltuman Voice would be received by the 16carned
with avidity, are now over." And, his imagination kindling at a ray of hope,
he adds: " It is not improbable that the active genius of the French, who are
so remarkably attentive to their language, may first adopt this vehicle" of
instruction in reading and speaking. But more than forty years have passed
Bince this suggestion was thrown out; and the French, so quick to adopt
improvements based on scientific analysis, have been as backward as W&lt;alker's
own countrymen in applying to practical uses his discovery. But although
the Science of Europe has weighed these artificial systems in the balance, and
found them wanting for practical purposes of instruction, the hope seems to
be entertained that Young America will not yet a while concur in the judgment.
"' It is surely a' circuitous path," says Archbishop Whately, "when the
learner is directed first to consider how each passage ought to be read (that
is, what mode of delivering each part of it would spou.taneously occur to him,
if he were attending exclusively to the matter of it); then to observe all the
modulations, &amp;c., of voice, which take place in such a delivery; then to note
these down, by established marks, in writing; and, lastly, to pronounce
according to these marks."  " Such instruction is like that bestowed by
Moliere's pedantic tutor upon his Bourgeois Gentilhomme, who was taught,
to his infinite siurprise and delight, what configuration3. of the mouth he
employed in pronouncing the several letters of the alphabcts, wihich he had been
accustomed to utter, all his life, Without knowing how."
The labors of Steele, Walker and Rush, are important, and their analyses
of vocal expression may always be studied with profit. But the attempt to
establish a practical system of elocutionary rules, which may be a consistent
and reliable guide to the pupil in reading aloud and in declamation, has been
continually baffled. The subject is not one that, in its nature, admits of a
resolution into rigid analytical rules. Thought and language being as various
as the minds of men, the inflections of the human voice must partake of their
plastic quality; and passion and genuine emotion must break through all the
rules which theorists can frame. Anatomy is a curious and a profitable
study; but what if we were to tell the pugfilist that, in order to give a blow
with due effect, he ought to know how the muscles depend for their powers
of contraction and relaxation on the nerves, and how the nerves issue
from the brain and the spinal marrow, with similar facts, requiring, perhaps, a lifetime of study for their proper comprehension, - would he not
laugh at us for our advice? And yet, even more unreasonable is it to say,
that, to accomplish ourselves in reading and speaking, we must be able to
classify a sentence under the head of " loose" or " compact," and their subdivisions, and then to glibly enunciate it according to some arbitrary rule, to
which, the probability is, there are many. unsurmised exceptions. When
Edmund Kean thrilled the heart of a great audience with the tones cf ind.o
scribable pathos which he imparted to the words,
"Othello's occupation's gone,"
it would have puazzled him to tell whether the sentence was a "simple declat
ative" or an^" imperfect loose."  He knew as little of " intensive slides,'"
"'bends," " sweeps," and" closes," as Cribb, the boxer, did of osteology.
Hie studied the intonation which most touched his own heart; and he gave
it, reckless of rules, or, rather, guided by that paramount rule, which seeks
the highest triumphs of art in elocution in the most genuine utterances of
nature.
Attention is the secret of success in speaking, as in other departments of
hurmun effort. Sit Isaac Newton was one day asked how he had discoveredTHE STANDARD SPEAKER.;s become Gf' all those persons who, for the last six months, have been,
by every outward and visible indication, evincing, maintaining, and
inculcating an opinion diametrically opposite? Who wrote that multitude of pamphlets, with the recollection of which one's head is still
dizzy? Does the honorable gentleman apprehend that his arguments
nmust have wrought their conversion?
When Bonaparte, not long ago, was desirous of reconciling the
Nations under his dominion to the privations resulting from the
exclusion of all colonial produce, he published an edict, which comnencced in something like the following manner,- "Whereas, sugar
made from beet-root, or the maple-tree, is infinitely preferable to that
of the sugar-cane," -and he then proceeded to denounce pc.nalties.
against those who should persist in the use of the inferior commodity.
The denunciation might be more effectual than the right honorable
gentleman's Resolution; but the preamble did not go near so far; for,
though it asserted the superiority of the maple and beet-root sugar, it
rested that assertion merely on the authority of the State, and did not
pretend to sanction it by " public estimation."
When Galileo first promulgated the doctrine that the earth turned
round the sun, and that the sun remained stationary in the centre of
the universe, the holy fat,hers of the Inquisition took alarm at so daring an innovation, and forthwith declared the first of these propositions
to be false and heretical, and the other to be erroneous in -point of
faith. The Holy Office " pledged itself to believe" that the earth was
stationary, and the sun mqvable. This pledge had little effect in changing the natural course of things; the sun and the earth continued, in
spite of it, to preserve their accustomed relations to each other, just as
the coin and the bank-note will, in spite of the right honorable gentleman's Resolution.
Let us leave the evil, if it must be so, to the chance of a gradual
and noiseless correction.  But let us not resolve, as law, what is an
incorrect and imperfect exposition of the law. Let us not resolve, as
fact, what is contradictory to universal expelience. Let us not expose
ourselves to ridicule by resolving, as the opinions of the People, opinions which the People do not, and which it is i[mpessible they should,
entertain.
93. AGAINST LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S MOTION, APRIL 256, 1822. -Id.
THIERE are wild theories abroad.  I am not disposed to impute an
ill motive to any man who entertains them.  I will believe such a mall
to be as sincere in his conviction of the possibility of realizingf his
notions of change, without risking the tranquillity of the country, as I
am sincere in my belief of thleir impracticability, and of the tremendous
danger of attempting to carry them into effect; but, for the sake of the
world, as well as for our own safety, let us be cautious and firm.
Other Nations, excited by the example of the liberty which this
country has long possessed, have attempted to copy our Constitution
L;48SENATORIAL. --CANNING.
and some of them have shot beyond it in the.fierceness of their pursuit.
I grudge not to other Nations that share of liberty which they may
acquire; - in the name of Heaven, let them enjoy it! But let us warn
them, that they lose not the object of their desire by the very eagerness with which they attempt to grasp it.  Inheritors and conservators
of rational freedom, let us, while others are seeking it in restlessness
and trouble, be a steady and shining light to guide their course, not
a wandering meteor to bewilder and mislead them.
A search after abstract perfection in government may produce; in
generous minds, an enterprise and enthusiasm  to be recorded by the
historian, ancl to be celebrated by the poet; but such perfection is not
an object of reasonable pursuit, because it is not one of possible attainment; and never yet did a passionate struggle after an absolutely unattainable object fail to be productive of misery to an individual, of' madness and confusion to a People.  As the inhabitants of. those burning
climates which lie beneath the tropical sun sigh for the coolness of the
mountain and the grove, so (all history instructs us) do Nations which
have basked for a time in the torrent blaze of an unmitigated liberty
too often call upon the shades of despotism, even of military despotisni,
to cover them:
"0 quis me gerldis in vallibus Hlami
Sistat, et ingenti ram6rum prot.gat umbra!"
A protection which blights while it shelters; which clwarfs the intellect
and stunts the energies of man, but to which a wearied Nation willingly resorts from intolerable heats, and from perpetual danger of convulsion.
Our lot is happily cast in the temperate zone of freedom, - the clime
best suited to the development of the moral qualities of the human
race, to the cultivation of their faculties, and to the security as well
as the improvement of their virtues;--a clime not exempt, indeed,
from variations of the elements, but variations which purify while they
agitate the atmosphere that we breathe.  Let us be sensible of the
advantages which it is our happiness to enjoy.  Let us guard, with
pious gratitude, the flame of genuine liberty, that fire from Heaven, of
which our Constitution is the holy depository; and let us not, for the
chance of rendering it more intense and more radiant, impair its purit;y
or hazard its extinction

THE friendship of Holland! The independence of Spain! Is there
a man so besotted as to suppose that there is one hour of peace with
Fiance preserved by either of these unhappy countries, that there is
one syllable of friendship uttered by themn towards France, but what
is extorted by the immediate pressure, or by the dread and terror, of

i.ave the regenerated Republic of Holland, the degraded Monarclhy
of Spain, such reason to rejoice in the protection of the French Republie, that they would voluntarily throw themselves between her and any
blow which might menace Ltr existence?  
But does the honorable Gentleman   intend his motion as a
motion for peace? If he really thinks this a moment for opening a
negotiation, why has he not the candor and manliness to say so  
Mark, I entreat you, how delicately he manages it!  Ile will [lot
speak to France, but he would speak at her. He will not prolpos --
not he --that we should say to the Directory, "Will you ntake
peace?"  No, Sir; we are merely to say to ourselves, loud enough for
the Directory to overhear us, "I wish these French Gentlemen would
make an overture to us."  Now, Sir, does this save the dignity of the
country? or is it only a sneaking, shabby way of doing what, if fit to
be done a.t all, must, to have any serious effect, be done openly, unequivocally, and directly?  But I beg the honorable Gentleman's
pardon;--I misrepresent him; I certainly do. His motion does not
amount even to so much as I have stated. He begins further off.
The soliloquy which he prompts us, by his motion, is no more than
this--' We must continue to make war against France, to be sure; -
and we are sorry for it; but we will not do it as if we bore malice.
We will not make an ill-natured, hostile kind of war any longer,- that
we won't.  And who knows but, if they should happen to overhear
this resolution, as the Directory are good-natured at bottom, their
hearts may soften and grow kind towards us --and then they will
offer to make a peace! "  And thus, Sir, and thus only, is the motion
a motion for peace.
Since, then, Sir, this motion appears to me to be founded on no
principle of policy or necessity; since, if it be intended for a censure
on ministers, it is unjust, --if for a control, it is nugatory; as its
tendency is to impair the power of prosecuting war with vigor, and to
*diminish the chance of negotiating peace with dignity, or concluding it
with safety; as it contradicts, without reason, and without advantage,
the established policy of our ancestors; as it must degrade in the eyes
of the world the character of this country; as it must carry dismay
and terror throughout Europe; and, above all, as it must administer
aonsolation, and hope, and power, and confidence, to France, - I shall
give it rmy most hearty and decided negative.
95. VINDICATION OF MR. PITT.--George Canning
IT appears to be a mneasure of party to run down the fame of Mr.
Pitt.  I could not answer it to my conscience or to my feelings, if 1
had suaffered repeated provocations to pass without notice.  Mr. Pitt,
it seenis, was not a great man. Is it, then, that we live iP such heroic
times, that the present is a race of such gigantic talents and qualities, as
to render those of Mr. Pitt, in the comparison, ordinary and contempt250SENATORIAL. - CANNING.
ible?  Wh~c, then, is the man now living, - is there any man now
sitting in this House, - who, by taking the measure of his own mind,
or of that of any of his contemporaries, can feel himself justified in
pronouncing that Mr. Pitt was not a great man? I admire as much
as any man the abilities and ingenuity of the honorable and learned
gentleman who promulgated this opinion. I do not deny to him many
of the qualities which go to constitute the character which he has
described. But I think I may defy all his ingenuity to frame any
definition of that character which shall not apply to MIr. Pitt, - to
trace any circle of greatness from which Mr. Pitt shall be excluded.
I have no manner of objection to see placed on the same pedestal
with Mr. Pitt, for the admiration of the present age and of posterity,
other distinguished men; and amongst them his great rival, whose
memory is, I have no doubt, as dear to the honorable gentlemen opposite, as that of Mr. Pitt is to those who loved him living, and who
revere him  dead.  But why should the admiration of one be incompatible with justice to the other? Why cannot we cherish the remembrance of the respective objects of our veneration, leaving to each other
a similar freedom? For my own part, I disclaim such a spirit of
intolerance.  Be it the boast and the characteristic of the school of
Pitt, that, however provoked by illiberal and unjust attacks upon his
memory, whether in speeches in this House or in calumnies out of it,
they will never so far forget the respect due to him or to themselves,
as to be betrayed into reciprocal illiberality and injustice, - that they
disdain to retaliate upon the memory of Mr. Pitt's great rival!
96. 1"M1E3ASUSiRES NOT MEN," 1802.--George Cansning.
IF I am pushed to the wall, and forced to speak my opinion, I have
no disguise nor reservation: - I do think that this is a time when the
administration of the government ought to be in the ablest and fittest
hands; I do not think the hands in which it is now placed answer to
that description. I do not pretend to conceal in what quarter I think
that fitness most eminently resides; I do not subscribe to the doctiines
which have been advanced, that, in times like the present, the fitness
of individuals for their political situation is no part of the consideration
to which a member of Parliament may fairly turn his attention. I
know not a more solemn or important duty that a member of Parliament, can have to discharge; than by giving, at fit seasons, a free
opinion upon the character and qualities of public men. Away with
the cant of " measures, not men! " the idle supposition that it is the
harness, and not the horses, that draw the chariot along!'No, Sir; if
the comparison must be made, if the distinction must be taken, men
aie everything, measures comparatively nothing. I speak, Sir, of times
of difficulty and danger; of times when systems are shaken, when precedents and general rules of conduct fail. Then it is, that not to this
or that measure, - however prudently devised, however blameless in
251THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
execulLon, - but to the energy and character of individua/s, a State must
be indebted for its salvation. Then it is that kingdoms rise or fill in
proportion as they are upheld, not by well-meant endeavors (laudable
though they may be), but by commanding, overawing talents, - by able
men.
And what is the nature of the times in which we live?  Look at
France, and see what we have to cope with, and congider what has mnade
her what she is. A man! You will tell me that she was great, and
powerful, and formidable, before the days of Bonaparte's government;
that he found in her great physical and moral resources; that he ha,d
but to turn them' to account. True, and he did so. Compare the
situation in which he found France with that to which he has raised
her. I am no panegyrist of Bonaparte; but I cannot shut my eyes
to the superiority of his talents, to the amazing ascendency of his
genius. Tell me not of his measures and his policy. It is his genius,
his character, that keeps the world in awe. Sir, to meet, to check, to
curb, to stand up against him, we want arms of the same kind. I amn
far from objecting to the large military establishments which are proposed to'you. I vote for them, with all my heart.  But, for the purpose of coping with Bonaparte, one great, commanding spirit is worth
them all.
97. THE BALANCE OF POWElt, 1826. - George Canning.
BUT, then, Sir, the balance of power! Gentlemen assert that the
entry of the French army into Spain disturbed that balance, and we
ought to have gone to war to restore it! Were there no other means
than war for restoring the balance of power'? Is the balance of power
a, fixed and unalterable standard? Or, is it not a standard perpetually varying, as civilization advances, and as new Nations spring up,
and take their place among established political communities?  The
balance of power, a century and a half ago, was to be adjusted between
France and Spain, the Netherlands, Austria and England.  Some
years afterwards, Russia assumed her high station in European politics. Some years after that, again, Prussia became not only a subl
stantive, but a preponderating monarchy.  Thus, while the balance
of power continued in principle the same, the means of adjusting it
became more varied and enlarged. To look to the policy of Europe in
the times of William and Anne to regulate the balance of power in
Europe at the present day, is to disregard the progress of events, and
to confuse dates and facts which throw a reciprocal light upon each
other.
I admit, Sir, that the entry of a French army into Spain was a
disparagement to Great Britain. I do not stand up here to deny that
fact. One of the modes of redress was by a direct attack upon France,
-by a war upon the soil of Spain. Was there no other mode of
redress?  If France occupied Spain, was it necessary, in order tc
avoid th-.onsequences of that occupation, that we should boekade..52SENATORIAL. - CAANING 4.
Cadiz? No.   I looked another way.  I sought materials of compensation in another hemisphere.  Contemplating Spain such as our
ancestors had known her, I resolved that, if France had Spain, it should
not be Spain " with the Indies."  I called the New World into existence, to redress the balance of the Old! Thus, Sir, I answer the
question of the occupation of Spain by the army of France. That
occupation, is an unpaid and unredeemed burden to France.  France
would be glad to get rid of the possession of Spain.  France would.
be very glad if England were to assist her to get rid of that possession; and the only way to rivet France to the possession of Sp?,n is
to make that possession a point of honor. The object of the measure
before the House is not war. It is to take the last chance of peace.
If you do not go forth, on this occasion, to the aid of Portugal, Portugal will be trampled down, to your irrecoverable disgrace; and then
war will come, and come, too, in the train of degradation.  If you
wait until Spain have courage to mature her secret machinations into
open hostility, you will, in a little while, have the sort of war required
by the pacificators: and who shall say where that war shall end?
98. A COLLISION OF VICES, 1825.--George Canning.
MY honorable and learned friend * began by telling us that, after
all, hatred is no bad thing in itself.  "I hate a tory," says my honorable fiiend; " and another man hates a cat; but it does not follow that
he would hunt down the cat, or I the tory."  Nay, so far from it,
hatred, if it be properly managed, is, according to my honorable
friend's theory, no bad preface to a rational esteem and affection. It
prepares its votaries for a reconciliation of differences; for lying down
with their most inveterate enemies, like the leopard and the kid in the
vision of the prophet. This dogma is a little startling, but it is not
altogether without precedent.  It is borrowed from a character in a
play, which is, I dare say, as great a favorite with my learned friend
as it is with me, - I mean the comedy of the Rivals; in which Mrs.
Malaprop, giving a lecture on the subject of marriage to her niece
(who is unreasonable enough to talk of liking, as a necessary preliminary to such a union), says, "What have you to do with your likings
and your preferences, child?  Depend upon it, it is safest to begin
with a little aversion. I am sure I hated your poor dear uncle like a
blackamoor before we were married; and yet, you know, my dear,
what a good wife I made him."   Such is my learned friend's argument, to a hair. But, finding that this doctrine did not appear to go
down with the House so glibly as he had expected, my honorable and
learned friend presently changed his tack, and put forward a theory
which, whether for novelty or for beauty, I pronounce to be incomparable; and, in short, as wanting nothing to recommend it but a
slight foundation in truth.  "True philosophy," says my honorable
friend, " will always continue to lead men to virtue by the instrument* Sir James Mlackintosh.
253rHE STANDARD SPEAKER.
ality of their confiicting vices  The virtues, where more than ons
exists, may live harmuniously together; but the vices bear mortal
antipathy to one another, and, therefore, furnish to the moral engineer
the power by which he can make each keep the other under control."
Adinirable! but, upon this doctrine, the poor man who has but one
single,ice must be in a very bad way.  No falc-um, no moral power,
for effecting his cure! Whereas, his more fo.,tunate neighbor, who
has two or more vices in his composition, is in a fair way of becominig
a very virtuous member of society.  I wonder how my learned friend
would like to have this doctrine introduced into his domestic establishment.  F'or instance, suppose that I discharge a servant because he is
addicted to liquor, I could not venture to recomlmend him to my honorable and learned friend.  It might be the poor man's only iault, and
therefore clearly incorrigible; but, if I had the good fortune to find
out that he was also addicted to stealing, might I not, with a safe conscience, send him to my learned friend with a strong recommendation,
saying, "I send you a man whom I know to be a drunkard; but I
am happy to assure you he is also a thief: you cannot do better than
employ him; you will make his drunkenness counteract his thievery,
and no doubt you will bring him out of the conflict a very moral per.,
sonage!"
99 ENGLAND AND AMERICA. -Sir James Mackintosh. Born, 1765; died, 1832
THE laws of England, founded on principles of liberty, are still, in
substance, the code of America. Our writers, our statutes, the most
modern decisions of our judges, are quoted in every court of justice,
from the St. Lawrence to -the Mississippi.  English law, as well as
English liberty, are the foundations on which the legislation of America is founded. The authority of our jurisprudence may survive the
power of our Government for as many ages as the laws of Rome conmmanded the reverence of Europe, after the subversion of her empire.
Our language is as much that of America as it is that of England.
As America increases, the glory of the great writers of England
increases with it; the admirers of Shakspeare and of Milton are multiplied; the fame of every future Englishman of genius is more widely
spread.  Is it unreasonable, then, to hope that these ties of birth, of
liberty, of laws, of language and of literature, may in time prevail
over vulgar, ignoble, and ruinous prejudices?  Their ancestors were
as much the countrymen of Bacon and Newton, of Hlampden and Sidney, as ours. They are entitled to their full share of that inheritaner
of glory which has descended from our common forefathers. Neither
the liberty of England, nor her genius, nor the noble language which
that genius has consecrated, is worthy of their disregard.  All these
honors are theirs, if they choose to preserve them. The history of Eagland, till the adoption of counsels adverse to liberty, is their history.
We may still preserve or revive kindred feelings.  They may claim
noble ancestors. and we may look forward to renowned descendan*s,

unless adverse prejudices should dispose thzern to reject those honors
which they have lawfully inherited, and lead zes to envy that gl:catness
which has arisen from our institutions and will perpetuate our faime!
100. THE FATE OF TIIE REFORMER, 1830. - Lo, I Brougham.
I IHAVE heard 1;i said that, when one lifts up his voice afgainst thingi
that are, and wishes for a change, he is raising a clamor against existing institutions, a clamor against our venerable establishmento, a
clalnor against the law of the land, but this is no clamor against the
one or the other, - it is a clamor against the abuse of them all.  It
is a clamor raised against the grievances that are felt.  Mr. Burke,
who was no friend to popular excitement, - who was no ready tool of
agitation, no hot-headed enemy of existing establishments, no undervaluer of, the wisdom of our ancestors, no scoffer against institutions as they are, --has said, and it deserves to be fixed, in letters of
gold, over the hall of every assembly which calls itself a legislative body,
-- "IWHIERE THERE IS ABUSE, THERE OUGHT TO BE CLAMIOR; BECAUSE IT
IS BETTER TO HAVE OUR SLUMBER BROKEN BY THE FIRE-BELL, THAN TO
PERISI-, AMIDST THE FLAMES, IN OUR BED."  I have been told, by some
who have little objection to the clamor, that I am a tiimid and a mock
reformer; and by others, if I go on firmly and steadily, and do noti
allow myself to be driven aside by either one outcry or another, and
care for neither, that it is a rash and dangerous innovation which I
propound; and that I am taking, for the subject of my reckless experiments, things which are the objects of all men's veneration.  I disregard the one as much as I disregard the other of these charges.
"False honor charms, and lying slander scares,
Whom, but the false and faulty? "  
It has been the lot of all men, in all ages, who have aspired at the
honor of guiding, instructing, or mending mankind, to have their paths
beset by every persecution from adversaries, by every misconstruction
from friends; no quarter from the one,-  no charitable construction
from the other! To be misconstrued, misrepresented, borne down, till
it was in vain to bear down any longer, has been their fate.  But truth
will survive, and calumny has its day.  I say that, if this be the fate
of thc( reformer,- if he be the object of misrepresentation,. - may not
an n nrenee be drawn favorable to myself?  Taunted by the enemies
of reUorm as being too rash, by the over-zealous friends of reform  as
be:i'hng too slow or too cold, there is every reason for presuming that I
hive chosen the right course.  A reformer must proceed steadily in
his career; not misled, on the one hand, by panegyric, nor discouraged
by slander, on the other.  He wants no praise.  I would rather say
--: "Woe to him when all men speak well of him! "   I shall go on
na the course which I have laid down for myself; pursuing the foot* Falsus honor juvat et mendax infamia terret

steps of those who have gone before us, who have left us their instruc.
tions and success, - their instructions to guide our walk, and their success to cheer our spirits.
101. PARLIAMENTARY REFORM, 1831. - Lord Brougham.
MY LORDs, I do not disguise the intense solicitude which I feel for
the event of this debate, because I know fLull well that the peace of
the country is involved in the issue.  I cannot look without dismay at
the rejection of this measure of Parliamentary Reform.  But, grievous
as may be the consequences of a temporary defeat, temporary it can
only be; for its ultimate, and even speedy success, is certain.  Nothing can now stop it. Do not suffer youriselves to be persuaded that,
even if the present Ministers were driven from the helm, any one could
steer you through the troubles which surround you, without reform.
But our successors would take up the task in circumnstances far less
auspicious.  Under them, you would be fain to grant a bill, compared
with which, the one we now proffer you is moderate indeed.  Hear the
parable of the Sibyl; for it conveys a wise and wholesome moral. She
now appears at your gate, and offers you mildly the volumes - the
precious volumes - of wisdom and peace. The price she asks is reasonable; to restore the franchise, which, without any bargain, you
ought voluntarily to give.  You refuse her terms --her moderate
terms;   she darkens the porch no longer.  But soon - for you cannot
do without her Wares - you call her back. Again she comes, but with
diminished treasures; the leaves of the book are in part torn away by
lawless hanlds, in part defaced with characters of blood.  But the
prophetic maid has risen in her demands; --it is Parliaments by the
Year --it is Vote by the Ballot- it is suffrage by the million!
From  this you turn away indignant; and, for the second time, sha
departs.  Beware of her third coming! for the treasure you must
have; and what price she may next demand, who shall tell?  It may
even be the mace which rests upon that woolsack! What may follow
your course of obstinacy, if persisted in, I cannot take upon me to predict, nor do I wish to conjecture.  Bult this I know full well; that,
as sure as man is mortal, and to err is human, justice deferred enhances
the price at which yo.l must purchase safety and peace; --nor can
you expect to gather in another crop than they did who went before
you, if you persevere in their utterly abominable husbandry, of sowing
injustice and reaping rebellion.
But, among the awful considerations that now bow down my mind;
there is one that stands preeminent above the rest.  You are the
highest judicature in the -realm; you sit here as judges, and decide all
causes, civil and criminal, without appeal. It is a judge's first duty
never to pronounce a sentence, in the most trifling case, without hearing.  Will you make this the exception?  Are you really prepared to
determine, but not to hear, the mighty cause, upon which a Nation's
hopes and fears hang? You are?   Then beware of your deeision!
Rouse not, I beseech you, a peace-loving but a iresoltute People! alien.

bind every one of us to our common order and our common country, I
solemnly adjure you, I warn you, I implore you, -   yea, on my bended

102. UNIVERSAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. -Daniel O'Connell.
Daniel O'Connell, the great Irish " agitator,1" or " liberator," as he was frequently called, was
born in the county of Kerry, Ireland, in 1775. He died in 1847. "Ilis was that marvellous
admixture of mirth, pathos, drollery, earnestness, and dejection," says Charles Pllillips, "which,
well compoulnded, form the true Milesian. He could whine and wheedle, and wink with one
eye while he wept with the other. Ilis fun was inexhaustible." O'Connell was apt to be too
violent and vituperative in his denunciations, and they consequently failed of their effect. The
abuse that is palpably exaggerated is not much to be feared.
CAN anything be more absurd and untenable than the argument of
the learned gentleman, when you see it stripped of the false coloring
he has given to it? First, he alleges that the Catholics are attached
to their religion with a bigoted zeal.  I admit the zeal, but I utterly
deny the bigotry. I-Ie proceeds to insist that these feelings, on our
part, justify the apprehensions of Protestants. The Catholics, he says,
are alarmed for their Church; why should not the Protestants be
alarmed, also, for theirs?  The Catholic desires safety for his religion:
why should not the Protestant require security for his?      Hence he
concludes, that, merely because the Catholic desires to keep his religion
free, the Protestant is thereby justified in seeking to enslave it.  He
says that our anxiety for the preservation of our Church vindicates
those who deem the proposed arrangement necessary for the protection
of theirs; - a mode of reasoning perfectly true, and perfectly applicable, if we sought any interference with, or control over, the Protestant
Church, -  if we asked or required that a single Catholic should be
consulted upon the management of the Protestant Church, or of its
revenues or privileges.
But the fact does not bear him out; for we do not seek nor desire,.
nor would we accept of, any kind of interference with the Protestant
Church.   We disclaim and disavow any kind of control over it.     We
ask not, nor would we allow, any Catholic authority over the mode of
appointment of their clergy.  Nay, we are quite content to be excluded
forever from  even advising his Majesty with respect to any nratter
relating to or concerning the Protestant Church, - its rights its propelties, oi its privileges.  I will, for my own part, go much further;
and I d6 declare, most solemnly, that I would feel and express equal,.
if not stronger repugnance, to the interference of a Catholic wit'h the
Protestant Church, than that I have expressed and do feel to any
Protestant interference with ours.  In opposing their interference with
us, I content myself with   the mere. war.of words.   But, if the case

the true system  of the universe.  He replied, "By continually thinking
upon it."  He was frequently heard to declare that, "if he had done the
world any services, it was due to nothing but industry and patient thought;
that he kept the subject under consideration constantly before him, and
waited till the first dawning opened gradually, by little and little, into a full
and clear light." Attention to the meaning and full effect of what we uttor
in declamation will guide us, better than any system of marks, in a right disposition of emphasis and inflection.  By attention, bad habits are detected
and repudiated, and happy graces are seized and adopted. Demosthenes had
a habit of raising one shoulder when he spoke.    He corrected it by suspending a sword, so that the point would pierce the offending member when
unduly elevated.   He had a defective utterance, and this he amended by
practising declamation with pebbles in his mouth.
Practice in elocution, under the guidance, if possible, of an intelligent instructor, will lead to more solid results than the most devoted endeavors to learn,
by written rules, what is above all human attempt at "circumscription ahd
confine."  Possess your mind fully witlh the spirit of wvhat you have to iutter,
and the right utterance will come by practice. If it be a political speech of a
remarkable character, acquaint yourself * with the circumstances under which
it was originally uttered; with the history and peculiarities of the speaker;
and with the interests which were at stake at the time. Enter, with all the
warmth of your imaginative faculty, into the speaker's feelings; lose yourself in the occasion; let his words be stamped on your memory; and do
not tire in repeating them aloud, with such action and emphasis as attention
will suggest and improve, until you have acquired that facility in the utterance which is essential to an effective delivery before an audience. If it be a
poem which you have to recite, study to partake the enthusiasm which the
author felt in the composition. Let the poetical element in your nature be
aroused, and give it full play in the utterance of "thoughts that breathe,
and worids that burn."
The practice of frequent public declamation in schools cannot be too much
commended.    The advantages of such training, if not immediate, will be
recognized later in life. In awakening attention, inspiring confidence, acquainting the pupil with the selectest models of Oratory, compelling him to try his
voice before an audience, and impressing him with a sense of the importance
of elocutionary culture, the benefits which accrue from these exercises are
inestimable. The late John Quincy Adams used to trace to his simple habit
of reciting, in obedience to his father, Collins' little ode, " How sleep the
brave," &amp;c., the germ of a patriotic inspiration, the effects of which he felt
throughout his public career; together with the early culture of a taste for
elocutionl, which was of great influence in shaping his future pursuits.
DIVISIONS OF ELOCUTION.
Elocution is divided into Articulation and Pronunciation; Inflection and
Modulation; Emnphasis; Gesture.
ARTICULATION AND PRONUNCIATION.
Correct articulation is the most important exercise of the voice, and:f tlLt
organs of speech. A public speaker, possessed only of a moderate voice, if he
articulate correctly, will be better undlerstood, and heard with greater pleasure,
than one who vociferates, without jutdgment. The voice of the latter may,
indeed, extend to a considerable distance, but the sound is dissipated in con,.

So help me God! I would, in that case, not only feel for the Protestant,
and speak for him, but I would fight for him, and cheerfully sacrifice
my life in defence of the great principle for which 1 have ever contended, - the principle of universal and complete religious liberty!
103. ON THE IRISH DISTURBANCE BILL. -Daniel O'Connell.
I DO not rise to fawn or cringe to this House; - I do not rise to
supplicate you to bte merciful toward the Nation to which I belong, -
toward a Nation which, though subject to England, yet is distinct from
it. It is a distinct Nation: it has been treated as such by this country,
as may be proved by history, and by seven hundred years of tyranny.
I call upon this House, as you value the liberty of England, not to
allow the present nefarious bill to pass. In it are involved the liberties
of England, the liberty of the Press, and of every other institution
dear to Englishmen. Against the bill I protest, in the name of the
Irish People, and in the face of Heaven. I treat with scorn the puny
and pitiful assertions, that grievances are not to be complained of,--
that our redress is not to be agitated; for, in such cases, remonstrances
cannot be too strong, agitation cannot be too violent, to show to the
world with what injustice our fair claims are met, and under what
tyranny the People suffer.
The clause which does away with'trial by jury, - what, in the
name of Heaven, is it, if it is not the establishment of a revolutionary
tribunal?  It drives the judge from his bench; it does away with
that which is more sacred than the Throne itself, - that for which your
king reigns, your lords deliberate, your commons assemble.. If ever I
doubted, before, of the success of our agitation for repeal, this bill,this infamous bill,-- the way in which it has been received by the
House; the manner in which its opponents have been treated; the per*sonalities to which they have been subjected; the yells with which
one of them has this night been greeted, - all these things dissipate
my doubts, and tell me of its complete and early triumph. Do you;think those yells will be forgotten? Do you suppose their echo will
not reach the plains of my injured and insulted country; that they
will not be whispered in her green valleys, and heard from her lofty.
hills? 0, they will be heard there! - yes; and they will not be forgotten  The youth of Ireland will bound with indignation, - they
will say, "We are eight millions; and you treat us thus, as though we
were no more to your country than the isle of Guernsey or of Jersey!'
I have done my duty. I stand acquitted to my conscience and my
~.ountry. I have opposed this measure throughout; and I now pro.
test against it, as harsh, oppressive, uncalled, for, unjust; - as estaM'i
lishing an infamous precedent, by retaliating crime against crime;--
as tyrannous, -- cruelly and vindictively tyrannrous!
258SENATORIAL. - BYRON,
IO. THE DEATH?E~NALTY FOR NEW OFFENCES, 1812.--Lora Byron. B. 1778; d. 1824
SETTING aside the pblpable injustice and the certain inefficiency of
tk,is Bill, are there not capital punishments sufficient in your statutes?
Ts there not blood enough upon your penal code, that more must be
poured forth, to ascend to Heaven and testify against you? How will
you carry this Bill into effect?  Can you comlmit a whole country to
their own prison? Will you erect a gibbet in every field, and hang up
men like scarecrows? or will you proceed (as you must, to bring this
measure into effect) by decimation; place the country under martial
law; depopulate anid lay waste all arouncl you; and restore Sherwood
Forest as an acceptable gift to the Crown, in its former condition of a
royal chase, and an asylum for outlaws?  Are these the remedies for
a starving and desperate populace? Will the famished wretch who
has braved your bayonets be appalled by your gibbets? When death
is a relief, and the only relief, it appears, that you will afford him, will
he be dragooned into tranquillity?  Will that which could not be
effected by your grenadiers be accomplished by your executioners?
If you proceed by the forms of law, where is your evidence? Those
who have refused to impeach their accomplices when transportation only
wvas the punishment, will hardly be tempted to witness against them when
death is the penalty. With all deference to the noble Lords opposite,
I think a little investigation - some previous inquiry - would induce
l-ven them to change their purpose. That most favorite State measure,
so marvellously efficacious in many and recent instances, - temporizing, - would not be without its advantage in this. When a proposal
is made to emancipate or relieve, you hesitate, you deliberate for years,
- you temporize and tamper with the minds of men; but a death-bill
must be passed off hand, without a thought of the consequences.  Sure
I am, from what I have heard, and from what I have seen, that to pass
the Bill, under all the existing circumstances, without inquiry, without deliberation, would only be to add injustice to irritation, and barbarity to neglect.
The framers of such a Bill must be content to inherit the honors of
that Athenian lawgiver,* whose edicts were said to be written not in
ink, but in blood. But suppose it passed,--suppose one of these
men, as I have seen them, meagre with famine, sullen with despair,
careless of a life which your Lordships are, perhaps, about to value at
something less than the price of a stocking-frame, - suppose this man
surrounded by those children, for whom he is unable to procure bread
at the hazard of his existence, about to be torn forever from a family
which he lately supported in peaceful industry, and which it is not his
fault that he can no longer so support;- suppose this man,- and
there are ten thousand such, from whom you may select your victims,
-- dragged into Court, to be tried, for this new offence, by this new
law, - still, there are two things wanting to convict and condemn him;
and these are, in my opinion, twelve butchers for a Jury, and a Jeffries
for a Judge!' Dracon, the author of the first written code of laws fcr Athens.

Italy, where he held the post of British Minister, May 25th, 1851. Ile was returned to the
Imperial Parliament in 1829, and for twenty years was a prominent member of the -louse of
Commons. A contempolary says of him: "His great earnestness and apparent sincerity, his
unrivalled felicity of illustration, his extraordinary power of pnshing the meaning of words to
the utmost extent, and wringing from them a force beyond the range of ordinary expression,
were such, that, when he rose to speak, members took their places, and the hum of private conversation was hushed, in order that the House might enjoy the perforlmances of an accomplishe.
artist." His style of speaking was peculiar; his gesticulation rapid, fierce, and inlcessant:
his enunciation remarkably quick and impetuous. His matter was uniformly well arrarraed
and logical. He carefully prepared himself before speaking.
C(ALUMNIATORS of Catholicism, have you read the history of your
country?   Of the charges against the religion of Ireland, the ailnals
of England afford the confutation. The body of your common law was
given by the Catholic Alfred.    He gave you your judges, your magistrates, your high-sheriffs, your courts of justice, your elective system,
and, the great bulwark of your liberties, the trial by jury.   Who conferred upon the People the right of self-taxation, and fixed, if he did
not create, their representation?   The Catholic Edward the First;
while, in the reign of Edward the Thirdcl, perfection was given to the
representative system, Parliaments were annually called, and the
statute against constructive treason was enacted. It is false, - foully,
infamously false, - that the Catholic religion, the religion of your
forefathers, the religion of seven millions of your fellow-subjects, has
been the auxiliary of debasement, and that to its influence the suppression of British freedom   can, in a single instance, be referred.   I
am loath to say that which can give yout cause to take offence; but,
when the faith of my country is made the object of imputation, I
cannot help, I cannot refrain, from breaking into a retaliatory interrogation, and from asking whether the overthrow of the old religion of
England was not effected by a tyrant, with a hand of iron and a heart
of stone;-whether Henry did not trample upon freedom, while upon
Catholicism he set his foot; and whether Elizabeth herself, the virgin
of the Reformation, did not inherit her despotism      with her creed;
whether in her reign the most barbarous atrocities were not committed;
-whether torture, in violation of the Catholic common law of England,
was not politically inflicted, and with the shrieks of agony the Towers
of Julius, in the dead of night, did not reecho?
You may suggest to me that in the larger portion of Catholic
Europe freedom does not exist; but you should bear in mind that, at
a period  when the Catholic religion was in its most palmy state, freedom flouiished in the countries in which it is now extinct.     Falsc,-   I
repeat it, with all the vehemence of indignant asseveration, - utterly
false is the charge habitually preferred    against the religion which
Englishmen have laden with penalties, and have marked with degradation. I can bear with any other charge but this - to any other charge
I can listen with endurance.   Tell me that I prostrate myself befbre a
sculptured marble; tell me that to a canvass glowing with the
imagery of Heaven I benld miy knee; tell mn      e that my faith is nmy

not be extended, -  all this I will bear, -  to all this I will submit,
nay, at all this I will but smile, -   but do not tell me that I am    in
heart and creed a slave! -    Tl at, my countrymen cannot brook!       In
their own bosoms they carry the high consciousness that never was
imt'utation more foully false, or more detestably calumnious!
106. IRISII ALIENS AND ENGLISII VICTORIES.--She,l
This brilliant appeal - one of the most eloquent in the annals of British oratory - is firom Sheil's
Speech on the Ir1ish MIunicipal Bill, ill the Itouse of Commons, Febrluary 22l, 1837. The episode was called florth by an unfortul;tate exprlession which Lord Lynldhurst had employed, some
time before, in the House of Lords, in alluding to the Ir ish as " aliens, in blood aind religion."
During Sheil's speech, his Lordship was ii;ting undler the gallery; and it is recorded that Sheil
shook his hea(l illldignantly at hiln, as he spoke. The effect upon the House was very marked.
Nearly all the members tuined towar(ls Lord Lyndrhurst; and the shouts of the iMinisterialists,
encountere( by the vehement outcries of thie Collservatives, continued for some minutes. The
latter half of this speech demands great rapidity of utterance in the delivery.
I SHOULD be surprised, indeed, if, while you are doing us wrong, you
did not profess your solicitude to do us justice. From the day on which
Strongbow set his foot upon the shore of Ireland, Englishmen were
never wanting in protestations of their deep anxiety to do us justice;
-  even Strafford, the deserter of the People's cause, -   the renegade
NWVenttworth, who gave evidence in Ireland of the spirit of instinctive
tyranny which predominated in his character, -even Strafford, while
he trampled upon our rights, and trod upon the heart of the counltry,
protested his solicitude to do justice to Ireland!    What marvel is it,
then, that Gentlemen opposite should deal in such vehement protestations?  There is, however, one man, of great abilities,-  not a member
of this House, butt whose talents and whose boldness have placed him
in the topmost place in his party,    who, disdaininlg all imposture, and
thinking it the best course to appeal directly to the religious and
national antipathies of the People of this country,-      abandoning all
reserve, aniid flinging off the slencder veil by which his political associates affect to cover, although'they cannot hide, their motives, - dis.
tinctly and audaciously tells the Irish People that they are not
entitled to the same privileges as Englishmen; and pronounces thelrt,
in any particular which could eniter his minute enumeration of the
circumstances by which fellow-citizenship is created, in race, identity
and religion, to be aliens;- to be aliens in race, to be aliens in
country, to be aliens in religion!    Aliens! good God! was Arthur,
Duke of Wellington, in the Hfouse of Lords, -   and did he not start up
and exclaimn, "HOLD! I HAVE SEEN        THE ALIENS DO THEIR DUTY!"
The Duke of Wellington is not a man of an excitable temperament.
His mind is of a cast too martial to be easily moved; but, notwith.
standing his habitual inflexibility, I cannot help thinking that, when he
heard his Roman Catholic countrymen (for we are his countrymien)

ought to have recollected the many fieldcls of fight in whicht we have
been contributors to his renown.  "The battles, sieges, fortunes that
he has passed," ought to have come back upon him. He ought to
have remembered that, from  the earliest achievement in which he
displayed that military genius which has placed him foremost in the
annals of modern warfare, down to that last and surpassing combat'which has made his name imperishable,--from Assaye to Waterloo,
--the Irish soldiers, with whom your armies are filled, were, the
inseparable auxiliaries to the glory with which his unparalleled
successes have been crowned.   Whose were the arms that drove
your bayonets at Vimiera through the phalanxes that never reeled
in'the shock of war before?   What desperate valor climbed the
steeps and filled the moats at Badajos? *  All his victories should have
rushed and crowded back upon his memory, - Vimiera, Badajos, Salamanca, Albuera, Toulouse, and, last of all, the greatest --. Tell
me, - for you were there, - I appeal to the gallant soldier before me
(Sir Henry Hardinge), from whose opinions I differ, but who bears,
I know, a generous heart in an intrepid breast;- tell me, - for you
must needs remember, - on that day when the destinies of mankind
were trembling in the balance, while death fell in showers, when
the artillery of France was levelled with a precision of the most deadly
science, - when her legions, incited by the voice and inspired by the
example of their mighty leader, rushed again and again to the onset,
tell me if, for an instant, when to hesitate for an instant was to be
lost, the " aliens " blenched? And when, at length, the moment for
the last and decided movement had arrived, and the valor which had
so long been wisely checked was, at last, let loose, - when, with words
ramiliar, but immortal, the great captain commanded the great assault,
-. tell me if Catholic Ireland with less heroic valor than the natives
of this your own glorious country precipitated herself upon the foe?
The blood of England, Scotland, and of Ireland, flowed in the same
stream, and drenched the same field.   When the chill morning
dawned, their dead lay cold and stark together; - in the same deep
pit their bodies were deposited; the green corn of spring is now
breaking from their commingled dust; the dew falls from Heaven
upon their union in the grave.  Partakers in every peril, in the
glory shall we not be permitted to participate; and shall we be told,
as a requital, that we are estranged from the noble country for whose
salvation our life-blood was poured out?
107. THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH OF IRELAND. -Id.

between Catholic and Protestant - a miserable sectarian controvelsy
It is no such thing; it is the struggle for complete political equality
on the part of the overwhelming majority upon the one hand, and for
political ascendency on the part of the minority on the other.  Ca:.
that ascendency be maintained?  Taught so long, but uninstructed
still, wherefore, in the same fatal policy, with an infatuated pertinacity, do you disastrously persevere?  Can you wish, and, if you
wish, can you hope, that this unnatural, galling, exasperating ascendency should be maintained? Things cannot remain as they are.  To
what expedient will you fly? Would you drive the country into
insurrection, cut down the People, and bid the yeomanry draw
forth the swords clotted with the blood of 1798, that they may be
brandished in massacre, and sheathed in the Nation's heart?  For
what, into these terrific possibilities, are we madly, desperatoly,
impiously, to plunge? For the Irish Church! - the Church of the
minority, long the Church of the State, never the Church of the
People; the Church on which a faction fattens, by which a Nation
starves; the Church from which no imaginable good can flow, but
evil after evil, in such black and continuous abundance, has been for
centuries, and is to this day, poured out; the Church by which
religion has been retarded, morality has been vitiated, atrocity has
been engendered; which standing armies are requisite to sustain,
which has cost England millions of her treasure, and Irelarnd torrents
of her blood!
To distinctions between Catholic and Protestant let there be an'
end. Let there be an end to national animosities, as well as to sectarian detestations.  Perish the bad theology, which, with an impious
converse, makes God according'to man's image, and with infernal
passions fills the heart of man! Perish the bad, the narrow, the pernicious sentiment, which, for the genuine love of country, institutes a
feeling of despotic domination upon your part, and of provincial
turbulence upon ours!
108. TIlE REPEAL OF THE UNION, 1834..--Id.
THE population of Ireland has doubled since the Union.  What is
the condition of the mass of the People? Has her capital increased
in the same proportion? Behold the famine, the wretchedness and
pestilence, of the Irish hovel, and, if you have the heart to do en,

strations of the prosperity of Ireland. The mass of the People are
in a condition more wretched than that of any Nation in Europe;
they are worse housed, worse covered, worse fed, than the basest boors
in the provinces of Russia; they. dwell in habitatirrns to which your
swine would not be committed; they are covered with rags which
your beggars would disdain to wear, and not only do they nevei
taste the flesh of the animals which crowd into your markets, but
26342A                THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
while the sweaz drops from their brows, they never touch the bread
into which their harvests are converted. For you they toil, for yog
they delve; they reclaim the bog, and drive the plough to the
mountain's top, for you. And where does all this misery exist? In
a country teeming with fertility, and stamped with the beneficent
intents of God! When the famine of Ireland prevailed, - when her
cries crossed the Channel, and pierced your ears, and reached your
hearts, - the granaries of Ireland were bursting with their contents'
and, while a People knelt down and. stretched out their hands for
food, the business of deportation, the absentee tribute, was going on.
Talk of the prosperity of Ireland! Talk of the external magnifi.cenee of a poor-house, gorged with misery within!
But the Secretary for the Treasury exclaims: " If the agitators
would but let us alone, and allow Ireland to be tranquil! " - The
agitators, forsooth! Does he venture -has he the intrepidity - to
speak thus?  Agitators!  Against deep potations let the drunkard
rail; - at Crockford's let there be homilies against the dice-box;--
let every libertine lament the progress of licentiousness, when his
Majesty's ministers deplore the influence of demagogues, and Whigs
complain of agitation! How did you carry the Reform? Was it not
by impelling the People almost to the verge of revolution?  Was
there a stimulant for their passions, was there a provocative for
their excitement, to which you did not resort? If you have forgotten, do you think that we shall fail to remember your meetings at
Edinburgh, at Paisley, at Manchester, at Birmingham?  Did not
three hunared thousand men as,semble?  Did they not pass resolutions against taxes?  Did they not threaten to march on London?
Did not two of the cabinet min'isters indite to them epistles of' gratitude and of admiration? and do they now dare -have they the
audacity - to speak of agitation? Have we not as good a title to
demand the restitution of our Parliament, as the ministers to insist
on the reform of this House?
109. ENGLAND'S MISRULE OF IRELAND -Ild.
IF in Ireland, a country that ought to teem with abundance, there
prevails wretchedness without example, - if millions of paupers are
there without employment, and ofcen without food or raiment. - where
is the fault?  Is it in the sky, which showers verdure?- is it in the
sdil, which is surprisingly fertile? - or is it in the fatal course which
you the arbiters of her destiny, have adopted? She has for centuries
belonged to England.  England has used her for centuries as she has
pleased.  Hoqo has she used her, and what has been the result?  A
code of laws was in the first place established, to which, in the annals
of legislative atrocity, there is not a parallel; and of that code--
those institutes of unnatural ascendencyv -- the Irish Church is a remnant. In Heaven's name, what useful purpose has your gorgeous
tsstablishment ever promoted?  You cannot hope to proselytize uX4,ENAT'ORI,OL, - PALMERSTON.
through its means. You have put the experiment to the test of three
centuries. You hive tried everything.  If the truth be with you, it.,nay be great; but in this instance it does not sustain the aphorism -
for it does not prevail. If, in a religious point of view, the Estab
lishment cannot conduce to the interests of religion, what purpose does
it answer?  It is said that it cements the Union - cements the
Union! It furnishes the great argument against the Union; it is
the most degrading incident of all the incidents of degrad-ation  by
which that measure was accomDanied; it is the yoke, the brand, the
shame and the exasperation, of Ireland!
Public opinion and public feeling have been created in Ireland.
Men of all elasses have been instructed in the principles on which the
riglhts of Nations depend.  The humblest peasant, amidst destitution
the most abject, has learned to respect himself.  I remember when, if
you struck him, he cowered beneath the blow; but now, lift up your
hand, the spirit of insulted manhood will start up in a bosom covered
with rags, - his Celtic blood will boil as yours would do, --and he
will feel, and he will act, as if he had been born where the person of
every citizen is sacred from affronts, and from his birth had breathed
the noral atmosphere which you are accustomed to inhale.  In the
name of millions of my countrymen, assimilated to yourselves, I
demand the reduction of a great abuse, - the retrenchment of a monstrous sinecure,--I demand justice at your hands!  "Justice to
Ireland " is a phrase which has been, I am well aware, treated as a topic
for derision; but the time will come, -nor is it, perhaps, remote,--
when you will not be able to extract much matter for ridicule from those
trite but not trivial words. " Do justice to America," exclaimed the
father of that man by whom the Irish Union was accomplished; " do
it to-night, - do it before you sleep."  In your National Gallery is a
picture on which Lord Lyndhurst should look: it was painted by
Coplcy,* and represents the death of Chatham, who did not live long
after the celebrated invocation was pronounced.  "Do justice to
America, - do it to-night, - do it before you sleep!" There were men
by whom that warning was heard who laughed -when it Was uttered.
hEave a care lest injustice to Ireland and to America may not be
followed by the same results, - lest mournfulness may not succeed to
mirth, and another page in the history of England may not be writ
in her heart's blood!
110 CIVIL WAR THE GREATEST NATIONAL EVIL, 1829.--Lord Palmerston.
THEN come we to the last remedy, - civil war. Some gentlemen

be a little deeper read in the history of Ireland, they will find that in
Ireland blood has been shed,- that in Ireland leaders have been seized
trials have been had, and punishments have been inflicted.  They will
find, indeed, almost every page of the history of Ireland darkened by
bloodshed, by seizures, by trials, and by punishments. But what has
been the effect of these measures?  They have, indeed, been successful
in quelling the disturbances of the moment; but they never have gone
to their cause, and have only fixed deeper the poisoned barb tllat
rankles in the heart of Ireland.  Can one believe one's ears, when one
hears respectable men talk so lightly - nay, almost so wishfully - of
3ivil war?  Do they reflect what a countless multitude of ills those
three short syllables contain? It is well, indeed, for the gentlemen of
England, who live secure under the protecting shadow of the law,
whose slumbers have never been broken by the clashing of angry
swords, whose harvests have never been trodden down by the conflict
of hostile feet, - it'is well for them to talk of civil war, as if it were
some holiday pastime, or some sport of children:
"They jest at scars who never felt a wound."
But, that gentlemen from unfortunate and ill-starred Ireland, who
have seen with their own eyes, and heard with theii own ears, the miseries which civil war produces, --who have known, by their own experience, the barbarism, ay, the barbarity, which it engenders, -- that
such persons should look upon civil war as anything short of the last
and greatest of national calamities, - is to me a matter of the deepest
and most unmixed astonishment.   I will grant, if you will, that the
success of such a war with Ireland would be as signal and complete
as would be its injustice; I will grant, if you will, that resistance
would soon be extinguished with the lives of those who resisted; I
will grant, if you will, that the crimsoned banner of England would
soon wave, in undisputed supremacy, over the smoking ashes of their
towns, and the blood-stained solitude of their fields.  But I tell you
that England herself never would permit the achievement of such a
conquest; England would reject, with disgust, laurels that were dyed
in fraternal blood; England would recoil, with loathing and abhor.

1 A i not one of those, Sir, who would hold out to the People vain
hopes of immediate benefit, which it could not realize, from this
measure.  Neither am I one of those who maintain the opposite theory,
such as is well expressed in a well-known couplet,--
" How small, of all that human hearts endure,
That part which laws or kings can cause or cure!"

not true in politics. When I look to one country as compared to
another, at the different epochs of their history, I am forced to believe
that it is upon law and government that the prosperity and morality,
the power and intelligence, of every Nation depend. When I compare
Spain (in which theAtraveller is met by the stiletto in the streets, and
by the carbine in the high roads) to England, in the poorest parts of
which the traveller passes without fear, I think the difference is
occasioned by the different Governments under which the People live.
At least, Sir, it cannot be denied, that the end attained by the two
Governments of these respective countries is essentially different. Is
it possible, indeed, for any intelligent person to travel through countries, and not trace the characters and conduct of the inhabitants to the
nature of their Institutions and Governments?  When I propose,
therefore, a Reform of Parliament, - when I propose that the People
shall send into this House real Representatives, to deliberate on their
wants and to consult for their interests, to consider their grievances and attend to their desires,- when I propose that they shall
in fact, as they hitherto have been said to do in theory, possess the
vast power of holding the purse-strings of the monarch, - I do it under
the conviction that I am laying the foundation of the greatest improvement in the comforts and well-being of the People.
112. THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH OF IRELAND, 1845. -T. B. Macaulay.
OF all the institutions now existing in the civilized world, the
Established Church of Ireland seems to me the most absurd.  Is there
anything else like it? Was there ever anything else like it?  The
world is full of ecclesiastical establishments. But such a portent as
this Church of Ireland is nowhere to be found. Look round the continent of Europe.  Ecclesiastical establishments from the White Sea
to the Mediterranean; ecclesiastical establishments from the Wolga to
the Atlantic; but nowhere the church of a small minority enjoying
exclusive establishment.  look at America. There you have all forms
of Christianity, from Mormonism - if you call Mormonism Christianity
to Romanism.  In some places you have the voluntary system. In
some you have several religions connected with the State. In some
you have the solitary ascendency of a single Church. But nowhere.
from the Arctic Cirel to Cape Ilorn, do you find the Church of a
smal;, minority exclusively established. In one country alone-irn
Ireland alone - is to be seen the spectacle of a community of eight
millions of human beings, with a Church which is the Church of only
eight hundred thousand!
Two hundred and eighty-five years has this Church been at work.
What could have been done for it in the way of authority, privileges,
endowments, which has not been done? Did any other set of bishops
and priests in the world ever receive so much for doing so little?
Nay, did any other set of bishops and priests in the world ever receive
half as much for doing twice as much?  And what have we to qhow
261fusion. Of the former voice, not the smallest;-ibration is wasted every stroke is
~erceived at the utmost distance to which it reaches, and hence it may often
appear to penetrate even further than one which is loud, but badly articulated
"In just articulation," says Austiin, " the words are not hurried over, not
precipitated syllable over syllable. They are delivered out from the lips, as
beautiful coins, newly issued from the mint, deeply and accurately impressed,
perfectly finished, neatly struck by the proper organs, distinct, sharp, in dtue
succession, and of due weight."
Pronunciation points out the proper sounds of vowels and consonants, ani
the distribution of accent on syllables. Articulation has a reference to the positions and movements of the organs which are necessary to the production of
those sounds with purity and distinctness; it also regulates the proportion
of the sounds of letters in words, and of words in sentences. Articulation and
pronunciation may thus be sai(l to form the basis of elocution. An incorrect or
slovenly pronunciation of words should be carefully avoided. The most eloquent discourse may be marred by the mispronunciation of a word, or by a
vicious or provincial accent. The dictionaries of Worcester or Webster, in
which the pronunciation is based mzainly on the accepted standard of Walker,
should be carefully consulted by the pupil, wherever he is doubtful in regard
to the pronunciation of a word, or the accent of a syllable. These dictionaries also contain ample rules fbr the guidance and practice of the reader in
the attainment of a correct pronunciation of the rudimental sounds of the
vowels and consonants. They should be darefully studied. A speaker who
continually violates the ear of taste by his mispronunciation must nlever hope
to make a favorable impression upon an educated audience.
DEFECTS IN PRONUNCIATION.
The omission to sound the.final g in such words as moving, rising,- as if
they were spelled movin, risin,- is one of the most frequent defects which
inattentive readers exhibit. A habit also prevails of slurring the full sound of
the italicised letter in such words as belief, polite, political, whisper, which;
several, every, deliverer, traveller; history, memorable, melody, philosophy;
society, variety, &amp;c.; also of muffling the r in such words as alarm, reform,
arrest, warrior; omitting the e in the last syllable of sudden, mitten, &amp;c.;
corrupting the a in musical, social, whimsical, metal, &amp;c.; the i in certafiily,
fountain, &amp;c.; the last o in Boston, notion, &amp;c.; giving e the sound of u in
momentary, insolent, and the like; and a the same sound in jubilant, arrogant, &amp;c.; giving the sound of er to the final termination of such words as
fellow, potato, follow, hallow; giving to r in war, warlike, partial, &amp;c., the
sound of w; prolonging the sound of w in law, flaw, as if there were an r
tacked on at the end of the words; in suchl words as nature, creature, legislature, &amp;c., friiling to give the full sounid to the u and e of the last syllable,
as they are sounded in pure, sure, &amp;c.; giving to the a in scarce the souInd
vf u in purse; slurring the final o in occasion, invention, condition, &amp;c.; giving the sound of u to the a in Indian; giving the sound of um to the final m
in cha(sm, patriotism, &amp;c.; the sound of i to the e in gomdness, matchless; the
sound offle to theful of awful, beautiful, and the like. The e in the first
syllable of such words as terminate, mercy, perpetrate, &amp;c., ought, accordling
to the stricter critics in elocution, to have the sound of e in merit, terror, &amp;c
A habit of speaking through the nose, in the utterance of such words as nowv,
cow, is prevalent in New England, ana should be overcome by all who worui
mot make themselves ridiculous in educated society.

for alI this lavish expenditure?  What, but the most zealous Ronman

whatever.  There they are, as they were ages ago, ten to one against
the members of your Established Church.  Explain this to me. I

Explain this to me on Protestant principles.  If I were a Roman
Catholic, I could easily account for the phenomenon.  If I were a
Roman Catholic, I should content myself with saying that the mighty

promise, in defence of the unchangeable Church; that He, who, in the
old time, turned into blessings the curses of Balaam, and smote the
host of Sennache.rib, had signally confounded the arts and the power
of heretic statesmen.  But what is the Protestant to say? Is this a

to be heard with docility, to reign in the understandings and hearts of
men. A Church which is abhorred is useless, or worse than useless
and to quarter a hostile Church on a conquered People, as you would
quarter a soldiery, is, therefore, the most absurd of mistakes.
113. ON LIMITING THE HOURS OF LABOR,,1846. - T. B. IMtacaulay.
IF we consider man simply in a commercial point of view, simply
as a machine for productive labor, let us not forget what a piece of
mechanism he is, - how " fearfully and wonderfully made."  If we
have a fine horse, we do not use him exactly as a steam-engine; and
still less should we treat man so, more especially in his earlier years.
The depressing labor that begins early in life, and is continued too
long every day, enfeebles his body, enervates his mind, weakens his
spirits, overpowers.his undeJ;tanding, and is incompatible with any
good or useful degree of education.  A state of society in which such
a system prevails will inevitably, and in no long space, feel its baneful
effects. What is it which makes one community prosperous and flourishinc, more than another? You will not say that it is the soil; you
will not say that it is its climate; you will not say that it is its min.
eral wealth, or its natural advantages, - its ports, or its great rivers.
Is it anything in the earth, or in the air, that makes Scotland a richer
country than Egypt; or, Batavia, with its marshes, more prosperous
than Sicily?  No; but Scotchmen made Scotland what she is, and
D)utchmen raised their marshes to such eminence. Look to America.
Two centuries ago, it was a wilderness of buffaloes and wolves. What
has caused the change?  Is it her rich mould?  Is it her mighty
rivers? Is it*her broad waters? No; her plains wvere then as fertile
as they a:re row, -her rivers were as numerous. Nor was it any great

amount of capital that the emigrants carried out with them. They
took a mere pittance. What is it, then, that has effected the change?
~It is simply this, -you placed the Englishman, instead of the red
man, upon the soil; and the Englishman, intelligent and energetic, cut
down the forests, turned them into cities and fleets, and covered the
land with harvests and orchards in their place.
I am convinced, Sir, that this question of limiting the hours of labor,
being a question connected, for the most part, with persons of tender
years, -a question in which public health is concerned, and a question
relating to public morality, - it is one with which the State may properly interfere. Sir, as lawgivers, we have errors of two different kinds
to repair. We have done that which we ought not to have done; we
have left undone that which we ought to have done. We have regulated that which we ought to have left to regulate itself; we have left
unregulated that which it was our especial business to have regulated.
We have given to certain branches of industry a protection which was
their bane. We have withheld from public health, and from public
morality, a protection which it was our duty to have given. We have
prevented the laborer from getting his loaf where he could get it
cheapest, but we have not prevented him from prematurely destroying
the health of his body and mind, by inordinate toil. I hope and
believe that we are approaching the end of a vicious system of interference, and of a vicious system of non-interference.
114. REFORM, THAT YOU MAY PRESERVE, MARCH 2, 1831.- T. B. iMacaulay.
TURN where we may, - within, around, - the voice of great events
is proclaiming to us, " Refornr, that you may preserve! " Now, therefore, while everything at home and abroad forebodes ruin to those who
persist in a hopeless struggle against the spirit of the age; now, while
the crash of the proudest Throne of the Continent is still resounding
in our ears; now, while the roof of a British palace affords an ignominious shelter to the exiled heir of forty Kings;* now, while we see
on every side ancient institutions subverted, and great societies dissolved; now, while the heart of England is still sound; now, whlile
the old feelings and the old associations retain a power and a charm
which may too soon pass away; now, in this your accepted time,--
now, in this your day of salvation, - take counsel, not of prejudice, not
of party spirit, not of the ignominious pride of a fatal consistency, but
of history, of reason, of the ages which are past, of the signs of this
tmost portentous time. Pronounce in a manner worthy of the expectation with which this great debate has been anticipated, and of the
long remembrance which it will leave behind.  Renew the youth of
the State. Save property, divided agninst itself. Save the multitude,

those who concur in rejecting it may ever remember their votes with

the spoliation of property, and the dissolution of social order.
115. MEN ALWAYS FIT FOR FREEDOM. - T. B. Alacauzlay.
THERE is only one cure for the evils which newly-acquired freedom
produces, - and that cure is freedom!  WVhen a prisoner leaves his
cell, he cannot bear the light of day; he is unable to discriminate
colors, or recognize faces; but the remedy is not to remand him into
his dungeon, but to accustom him to the rays of the sun.  The blaze
of truth and liberty may at first dazzle and bewilder Nations which
have become half blind in the house of bondage; but let them gaze on,
and they will soon be able to bear it.  In a few years men learn tc
reason; the extreme violence of opinion subsides; hostile theories cor
rect each other; the scattered elements of truth cease to conflict, and
begin to coalesce;. and, at length, a system of justice and order is
educed out of the'chaos.  Many politicians of our time are in the
habit of laying it down as a self-evident proposition, that no People
ought to be free till they are fit to use their freedom.  The maxim is
worthy of the fool in the old story, who resolved not to go into the
water till he had learned to swim! If men are to wait for liberty till
they become wise and good in slavery. thlyT may, indeed, wait forever'
116. THE REFORM BILL A SECOND BILL OF RIGHTS, JULY 5, 1831.-Id.
THE whole of history shows that all great Revolutions have been
produced by a disproportion betweeu society and its institutions; for,
while society has grown, its institutions have not kept pace, and accommodated themselves to its improvements. The history of England is
the history of a succession of Reforms; and the very reason that the
People of England are great and happy is, that their history is the
history of Reform.  The great Charter, the first assembling of Parliament, the Petition of Right, the Revolution, and, lastly, this great
measure, are all proofs of my position, - are all progressive stages in
the progress of society, - and I am fully convinced that every argument urged against the step we are now called upon to take might have
been advanced with equal justice against any of the other changes I
have enumerated.  At the present moment we everywhere see society
outgrowing our institutions.  Let us contrast our commerce wealth,
and perfect civilization, with our Penal Laws, at once barbarous and
inefficient,-- the preposterous fictionls of pleading, the mummery of
270SENATORIAL. - MACAJULAX.
fines and recoveries, the chaos of precedents, and the bottomless pit
of Chancery. Here we see the barbarism of the thirteenth century
coupled with the civilization of the nineteenth; and we see, too, that
the barbarism belongs to the Government, and the civilization to the
People.  Then I say that this incongruous state of things cannot coun
tinue; and, if we do not terminate it with wisdom, ere long we shall
find it ended with violence.
I fear, that it may be deemed unbecoming in me to make any applii
cation to the fears of Members of this House.  But surely I nlay,
without reproach, address myself to their honest fears. It is well to
talk of opposing a firm front to sedition. But woe to the Government
that cannot distinguish between a Nation and a mob! woe to the
Government that thinks a great and steady movement of mind is to
be put down like a riot! This error has been twice fatal to the Bourbons; it may be fatal to the Legislature of this country, if they should
venture to foster it.  I do believe that the irrevocable moment has
arrived.  Nothing can prevent the passing of this noble law, - this
second Bill of Rights. I do call it the second Bill of IRights; and so
will the country call it, and so will our children.  I call it a gr eater
charter of the liberties of England.  Eighteen hundred and thirtyone is destined to exhibit the first example of an established, of a'
deep-rooted system, removed without bloodshed, or violence, or rapine,
--all points being debated, every punctilio observed, the peaceful
industry of the country never for a moment checked or compromised
and the authority of the law not for one instant suspended.
117. PUBLIC OPINION AND THE SWORD, OCT. 10, 1831.-T. B. Macaulay
AT the present moment I can see only one question in the State,
the Question of Reforfn; only two parties - the friends of the Bill, and
its enemies. No observant and unprejudiced man can look forward,
without great alarm, to the effects which the recent decision of the
Lords may possibly produce. I do not predict, I do not expect,
open, armed insurrection. What I apprehend is this - that the'People
may engage in a silent but extensive and persevering war against the
law. It is easy to say, " Be bold; be firm; defy intimidation; let
the law have its course; the law is strong enough to put down the
seditious." Sir, we have heard this blustering before; and we know
in what it ended.  It is the blustering of little men, whose lot has
fallen on a great crisis. Xerxes scourging the waves, Canute commanding the waves to recede from his footstool, were but types of the
folly. The law has no eyes; the law has no hands; the law is nothing -- nothing but a piece of paper printed by the King's printer, with
the King's arms at the top - till public opinion breathes the breath of
life into the dead letter.  We found this in Ireland.  The elections of
1826 - the Clare election, two years later - proved the folly of those
who think that Nations are governed by wax and parchment; and, at
271THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
length, in fne close of 1828, the Government had only one plain alter.
native before it - concession or civil war.
I know only two-ways in which societies can permanently be governed - by Public Opinion, and by the Sword. A Government having
at its command the armies, the fleets, and the revenues of Great Brit
ain, might possibly hold Ireland by the Sword.  So Oliver Cromwell
held Ireland; so William the Third held it; so Mr. Pitt held it; so
the Duke of _WVellington might, perhaps, have held it. But, to govern
Great Britain by the Sword - so wild a thought has never, I will venture to say, occurred to any public man of any party; and, if any man
were frantic enough to make the attempt, he would find, before three
days had expired that there is no better Sword than that which is
fashioned out of a Ploughshare! But, if not by the Sword, how is the
people to be governed? I understand how the peace is kept at New
York.   It is by the assent and support of the People.  I understand,
also, how the peace is kept at Milan.  It is by the bayonets of the
Austrian soldiers. But how the peace is to be kept when you have
neither the popular assent nor the military force, - how the peace is
to be kept in England by a Government acting on the principles of the
present Opposition, - I do not understand.
Sir, we read that, in old times, when the villeins * were driven to
revolt by oppression, - when the castles of the nobility were burned to
the ground, - when the warehouses of London were pillaged, -when
a hundred thousand insurgents appeared in arms on Blackheath, -
when a foul murder, perpetrated in their presence, had raised their
passions to madness, - when they were looking round for some Captain to succeed and avenge him whom they had lost, - just then, before
Hob Miller, or Tom Carter, or Jack Straw, could place himself at their
head, the King rode up to them, and exclaimed, "I will -be you:
leader! "-And, at once, the infuriated multitude laid down theit
arms, submitted to his guidance, dispersed at his command. Herein
let us imitate him.  Let us say to the People, "We are your lead.
ers, - we. your own House of Commons." This tone it is our interest
and our duty to take. The circumstances admit of no delay. Even
while I speak, the moments are passing away, -the     irrevocable
moments, pregnant with the destiny of a great People. The country is
in danger; it may be saved: we can save it. This is the way - this
is the time. In our hands are the issues of great good and great evil
--the issues of the life and death of the State!
118. A GOVERNMENT SHOULD GROW WITH THE PEOPLE, DEC. 16, 1831.- Id.
IT is a principle never to be forgotten, thiat it is not by absolute, but
by relative misgovernment, that Nations are roused to madness. Look
at our own history.  The liberties of the English people were, at least,
* A word derived from the Latin villa; whence villani, country people. The name
was given, in Anglo-Norman times, to persons not proprietors of land, m,ny of
whom were attached to the land, and bound to serve the lord of the manor
272SENATORIAL. --- MACAULAY.
as much respected by Charles the First as by Henry the Eighth,-by
James the Second, as by Edward the Sixth. But did this save the
crown of James the Second? Did this save the head of Charles the
First? Every person who knows the history of our civil dissensions
knows that all those arguments which are now employed by the opponents of the Reform Bill might have been employed, and were actually
employed, by the unfortunate Stuarts. The reasoning of Charles, and
of all his apologists, runs thus: " What new grievance does the Nation
suffer? Did the People ever enjoy more freedom than at present 7
Did they ever enjoy so much freedom?"  But what would a wise and
honest counsellor have replied? He would have said: " Though there
has been no change in the Government for the worse, there has been a
change in the public mind, which produces exactly the same effect
which would be produced by a change in the Government for the worse.
It may be that the submissive loyalty of our fathers was preferable to
that inquiring, censuring, resisting spirit which is now abroad. And
so it may be that infancy is a happier time than manhood, and manhood
than old age. But God has decreed that old age shall succeed to manhood, and manhood to infancy. Even so have societies their law of
growth.   As their strength becomes greater, as their experience
becomes more extensive, you can no longer confine them within the
swaddling-bands, or lull them in the cradles, or amuse them with the
rattles, or terrify them with the bugbears, of their infimcy. I do not
say that they are better or happier than they were; but this I say,--
they are. different from what they were; you cannot again make them
what they were, and you cannot safely treat them ias if they continued
to be what they were."
This was the advice which a wise and honest Minister would have
given to Charles the First. These were the principles on which that
unhappy prince should have acted. But no. He would govern,-- I
do not say ill - I do not say tyrannically; I say only this, - he would
govern the men of the seventeenth century as if they had been the
men of the sixteenth century; and therefore it was that all his talents,
and all his virtues, did not save him from unpopularity - from civil
war - from a prison - froom a, bar - from a scaffold!
119. REFORM IRRESISTIBLE.- T. B. Macaulay. Dec. 16, 1831.
Sin, I have, from the beginning of these discussions, supported
Reform, on two grounds: first, because I believe it to be in itself a
good thing; and, secondly, because I think the dangers of withholding
it to be so great, that, even if it were an evil, it would be the less of
two evils. I shall not relinquish the hope that this greai contest may
oe conducted, by lawful means, to a happy termination.  But, of this
I am assured, that, by means lawfiul or unlawful, to a termination,
happy or unhappy, this contest must speedily come. All that I know
of the history of past times, all the observations that I have been
18
273TEIE STANDA RD SPEAKER.
able to malkn Dn the present state of the country, have convincAd mne
thet, the time has arrived when a great concession must be made to
the Democracy of England; that the question, whether the change be
in itself good or bad, has become a question of secondary importance:
What, good or bad, the thing must be done; that a law as strong as
the laws of attraction and motion has decreed it. I well know that
history, when we look at it in small portions, may be so construed as
to mean anything; that it may be interpreted in as many ways as a
Delphic oracle.  "The French Revolution," says one expositor, " wa
the effect of concession."  "Not so," cries another; "'the French
Revolution was produced by the obstinacy of an arbitrary Government." These controversies can never be brought to any decisive test,
or to any satisfactory conclusion.  But, as I believe that history,
when we look at it in small fragments, proves anything or nothing, so
I believe that it is full of useful and precious instruction when we
contemplate it in large portions, - when we take in, at one view, the
whole life-time of great societies. We have heard it said a hundred
times, during these discussions, that the People of England are more
free than ever they were, that the Government is more Democratic
than ever it was; and this is urged as an argument against R{eform.
I admit the fact, but I deny the inference.  The history of England
is the history of a Government constantly giving way, - sometimes
peaceably, sometimes after a violent struggle, - but constantly giving
way before a Nation which has been constantly advancing. It is not
sufficient to look merely at the form of Government.  We must look
to the state of the public mind. The worst tyrant that ever had his
neck, wrung in modern Europe might have passed for a paragon in
Persia or Morocco. Our Indian subjects submit patiently to a monopoly of salt. We tried a stamp-duty - a duty so light as to be scarcely
perceptible- on the fierce breed of the old Puritans: and we lost an
Empire! The Government of Louis the Sixteenth was certainly a
much better and milder Government than that of Louis the Fourteenth: yet Louis the Fourteenth was admired, and even loved, by his
People; Louis the Sixteenth died on the scaffold! Why? Because.
though the Government had made many steps in the career of improvement, it had not advanced so rapidly as the Nation.
These things are written for our instruction. There is a change;
society.  There must be a corresponding change in the Government.
You may make the change tedious; you may make it violent; you
may - God, in his mercy, forbid! - you may make it bloody; but ave,-,
it you cannot. Agitations of the public mind, so deep and so long con
tinued as those which we have witnessed, do not end in nothing.  In
peace, or in convulsion, - by the law, or in spite of the law, - through
the Parliament, or over the Parliament, - Reform must be carried.
Therefore, be content to guide that movement which you cannot stop.
Fling wide the gates to that force which else will enter through the
breach.
274SENATORIAL. - CROKER.
12( REPLY TO THE FOREGOING, DEC. 16, 1831. -;-John W,.on CrGker
HAS the learned gentleman, who has been so eloquent on the necesaity of proceeding forward, - whc has told the House that argunlent is
vain; that there is no resisting the mighty torrent; that there is
dire necessity for the whole measure, - has he given the slightest
intimation of what would be, even in his opinion, the end of the
career, the result of the experiment, the issue of the danger?  Has
he scanned with the eye of a philosopher the probable progress of
future events? Not at all.  Anything more vague, anything more
indefinite, anything more purely declamatory, than the statelments of
the learned gentleman on that point, has never fallen from human lips.
It is true that the learned gentleman has told the House that the town
is besieged by superior forces, and has advised them to open the gates
of the fortress, lest it should be stormed at the breach. But did he
tell them that they could open thegates with safety? - without exposing their property to plunder, and their persons to massacre? They
were not, under the learned gentlemnan's advice, to attempt to make
any terms; but they were at once to throw open the gates; and await
the consequences, however fatal; and submit to the tender mercies of
the victors, even though there should be pillage, bloodshed and extermination.
The present state of the ream is unparalleled in history. The danger to which the Government is exposed is greater than the Ministers
themselves have ever imagined. As the progress of agitation may be
tracked through fire and blood, the pusillanimity of Ministers can be
also traced through every act of their administration, even those that
seemed the boldest. There is no word that they say, no act that they
do, no act that they abstain from doing, that is not carefully calculated
to offend as little as possible, when they cannot altogether conciliate,
the Political Unions, andc similar illegal and anarchical associations.
Ministers have raised a storm which it is beyond their power, beyond
the scope of their minds, to allay. In conclusion, I can assure the
HIouse that, in the censures I have passed on His Mlajesty's Ministers,
and in the appalling prospects I have laid before the House, I have
urged nothing but what springs from the most imperious sense of the
danger of the country; a danger for which I confess that I do not see
a remedy, although convinced that there are no means so calculated
to aggravate it to a tremendous extent as passing a Reform Bill.

which the existing clamor demands. He told you, Sir, that the stormy
tides of popular commotion were rising rapidly around us; that the
Stygian waters were rapidly gaining upon us, and that it was time for
us- and barely time --to endeavor to save ourselves from being,wallowed up by the devouring waves.  He told you that the deluge
of'public opinion was about to overwhelm you; and he invited you tc
emnbark with him on this frail and crazy raft, constructed in the blundering haste of terror, as the only means of escaping from destruction.
No Sir, no! trust not
"that fatal and perfidious bark,
Built in the eclipse; and rigged with curses dark!  
No, Sir! stand firm where you are, and wait until the threatening
waters subside. What you hear is not only a fictitious, but a factitious
clamor.  Be you calm, steady and bold; and the People, under the
influence of your wisdom and courage, will recover their wonted judgment, and become sensible of the value of what they would lose by
this scheme, and of the uselessness of what they might gain. Of the
Constitution of this country there might, perhaps, have been a better
theoretical arrangement; but I do, in my heart, firmly believe that
no human ingenuity could, a pri5ri, have conceived so admirable a
practical system, promoting, in such nice and just degrees, the wealth,
happiness and liberties, of the community at large,"Where jarring interests, reconciled, create
The according music of a well-mixed State;
Where small and great, where weak and strong, are made
To serve, not suffer, - strengthen, not invade;
More powerful each, as needful to the rest,
And, in proportion as it blesses, blest!"
122. EXTENSION OF THE TERM OF COPYRIGIIT, 1838. - T. N. Talfourd.
THERE is something, Sir, peculiarly unjust in bounding the term of
an author's property by his natural life, if he should survive so short
a period as twenty-eight years. It denies to age and experience the
probable reward it permits to youth- to youth, sufficiently full of
hope and joy to slight its promises.  It gives a bounty to haste, and
informs the laborious student, who would wear away his strength to
complete some work which "the world will not willingly let die,"
that the more of his life he devotes to its perfection, the niore limlited
shall be his interest in its fruits.  When his works assume their place
among the classics of his country, your law declares that those worTk
shall become your property; and you requite him by seizing the patrimony of his children!
In the words of Mr. Wordsworth's petition, "This bill has for its
main object to relieve men of letters from  the thraldom of- being
forced to court the living generation to aid them in rising  above
slavish taste and degraded prejudice, and to encourage them to rely on
their own impulses."  Surely this is an object worthy of lte Legisla.
276SlNATORI,AL. -- TALFOURD.
are of a great People, especially in an age where restless activity
and increasing knowledge present temptations to the slight and the
superficisl which do not exist in a ruder age. Let those who' to
beguile the time look like the time " have their fair scope, -- let cheap
and innocent publications be multiplied as much as you please,- still,
the character of the age demands something impie.esed with a noblet
labor, and directed to a higher aim.  "The immortal mind craves
objects that endure."  The printers need not fear. There will not be
too many candidates for "a bright reversion," which only falls in
when the ear shall be deaf to human praise.
I have been accused of asking you to legislate " on some sort of
sentimental feeling."  I deny the charge. The living truth is with
us. The spectral phantoms of depopulated printing-houses and shops
are the baseless fancies of our opponents.  If I were here beseeching
indulgence for the frailties and excesses which sometimes attend fine
talents, -if I were here appealing to your sympathy in behalf of
crushed hopes and irregular aspirations, - the accusation would be just.
I plead not for the erratic, but for the sage; not for the perishing, but
for the eternal: for him who, poet, philosopher or historian, girds
himself for some toil lasting as life, lays aside all frivolous pursuits
for one virtuous purpose, that, when encouraged by the distant hope
of that " ALL-HAIL HEREAFTER " which shall welcome him among the
heirs of fame, he may not shudder to. think of it as sounding with
hollow mockery in the ears of those whom he loves, and waking sullen
echoes by the side of a cheerless hearth! For such I ask this boon,
and through them for mankind; -and I ask it with the confidence,
in the expression of which your veteran petitioner, Wordsworth,
closed his appeal to you, "That in this, as in all other cases, justice
is capable of working out its own expediency."
123. REALITY OF LITERARY PROPERTY, 1838. -Id.
IT is, indeed, time that literature should experience some of the
blessings of legislation.  If we should now simply repeal all the
statutes which have been passed under the guise of encouraging
learning, and leave it to be protected only by the principles of the
common law, and the remedies which the common law would supply,
I believe the relief would be welcome.  It did not occur to our
ancestors that the right of deriving solid benefits from that which
springs solely from within us, - the right of property in that which
the mind itself creates, and which, so far from exhausting the mateirials common to all men, or limiting their resources, enriches and
expands them, - a right of property which, by the happy peculiarity
uf its nature, can only be enjoyed by the proprietor in proportion as
it blesses mankind, - should be exempted from the protection which
is extended to the ancient appropriation of the soil, and the rewards
olfeommercial enterprise.

lx the beginning of a course of elocution, it is necessary that a miniaut, aten
tion be paid to the producing of the exact sounds on the urn'aecrted1 syllables;
and s1ougb this may be censured by many, as affected and theatri,-al, it must,
for a time, be encouraged. Most persons will give the sound of a in accsssory
distinctly and purely, as the accent is on it; but, if the accent is on the second
syllable of a word beginning in the same way, as in accord, the greater number
of people would give the ac an obscure sound, as if the -vord were uccord. The
same remark holds with regard to the initial ab, ad, af, ag, ag, al, am, an, ar, ap,
as, at, av, az, con, col, &amp;c.; e, de, re, i, in, o, ohb, op, &amp;c. Thus,' the o in omen,
the e in exact, will be sounded correctly by most persons; but, in opilnion,
proceed, and emit, as the accent is shifted, these vowels would be gefierally

in nobody is not sounded like the o in body, as it should be; and the a in circumstances is different from the a in circumstantial; - the former woirds beinhg

famous, famuss; novel, novl; chicken, chickn; Latin, Latn.  Sometimes
the concluding consonant is almost lost in the unaccented syllable, while it is
preserved in the accented; thus, in the noun subject, in which the accent is on
the first syllable, the t is scarcely sounded by many who would sound it in
the verb to subject, in which the accent is on the last syllable. In d and l
final, the articulation is not completed until the tongue comes off from the roof
of the mouth. Distinctness is gained by this attention to the quality of unac-.cented vowels, and to the clear and precise utterance of the cousonants in
unaccented syllables. Carle must be taken, however, that the pupil do not
enunciate too slowly. The motions of the organs must frequently be rapid in
their changes, that the due proportions of syllables may be preserved.
As emphasis is to a sentence what accent is to words, thle remarks which
b'av. been made on accented and unaccented syllables apply to wvords emphatic
and unemphatic. The unemphatic words are also apt to become inarticulate
from the insufficient force which is put upon themn, and the vowel-sounds, a
in can as, and the consonant d in and, &amp;c., are changed or lost. In certain
wor;' suhel as my, mine, thy, thine, yot, your, the unemphatic pronunciation is di-,ferent fiom the emphatic, being sounded me, min, the, thin, ye, yur;
as, ttis is mi,in own, this is yur own. In solemn reading, this abbreviated
pronunciation is avoided, and the words are pronounced as they are when
single.
MODULATION OR MIANAGE3IENT OF TiE VOICE.
The modulation of the voice is one of the most important requisites in -
public speaker. Even to the private reader, who wishies to execute his taskTHE STANDARD SPEAKER.
"But," say the opponents of this measure, "we think that, from
the moment an author puts his thoughts on paper, and delivers them
to the world, his property therein wholly ceases."  What! has he
invested no capita.? embarked no fortune? If human life is nothing
in your commercial tables, - if the sacrifice of profession, of health,
of gain, is nothing, - surely the mere outlay of him who has perilled
his fortune to instruct mankind may claim some regard! Or is the
interest itself so refined, so ethereal, that you cannot regard it as
property, because it is not palpable to sense as to feeling? Is there
any justice in this? If so, why do you protect moral character as
a man's most precious possession, and compensate the party who
suffiers unjustly in that character by damages?  Has this possession
any existence half so palpable as the author's right in the printed
creation of his brain? I have always thought it one of the proudest
triumphs of human law, that it is able to recognize and to guard this
breath and finler spirit of moral action; that it can lend its aid in
sheltering that invisible property, which exists solely in the admiration and affection of others; and, if it may do this, wlly may it not
protect his interest in those living words, which, as was well observed
by that great thinker, Mr. Ilazlitt, are, "after all, the only things
which last forever "?
124. AN INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT.-Ild.
IN venturing to invite the attention of the House to the state of
the law affecting the property of men of letters in the results of
their geniu$ and labors, I would advert to one other consideration as
connected with this subject. I would urge the expediency and
justice of acknowledging the rights of foreigners to copyright in this
country, and of claiming it from them for ourselves in return. The
great minds of our time have an audience to impress far vaster than
it entered into the minds of their predecessors to hope for; an
audience increasing as population thickens in the cities of America,
and spreads itself out through its diminishing wilds; an audience
who speak our language, and who look on our old poets as their own
immortal ancestry.
And if this, our literature, shall be theirs, - if its diffusion shall
follow the efforts of the stout heart and sturdy arm, in their triumph
over the obstacles of nature, - if the woods, stretching beyond their
confines, snall be haunted with visions of beauty which our poets
have created,--let those who thus are softening the ruggedness of
young society have some present interest about which affection may
gather; and, at least,' let tlhem  be protected from those who would
exhibit them, mangled or corrupted, to their transatlantic disciples.
I do not, in truth, ask for literature favor; I do not ask for it
charity. I do not even appeal to gratitude in its behalf. But I ask
for it a portion, and but a portion, of that commor;ustice which th*
278SENATORIAL. - PEEL.
coarsest industry obtains for its nattral reward; justice, whicn
nothing but the very extent of its claims, and the nobleness of the
associations to which they are akin, have prevented it from receiving
fronm our laws.
126. TIIE LEGISLATIVE UNION, 1834.--Sir Robert Peel. Born, 1788; ded, 1S50.
I WANT no array of figures, I want no official documents, I want nG
speeches of six hours, to establish to my satisfaction the public policy
of maintaining the Legislative Union. I feel and know that the repeal
of it must lead to the dismemberment of this great empire, must make
Great Britain a fourth-rate power of Europe, and Ireland a savage
wilderness; and I will give, therefore, at once, and without hesitation,
an emphatic negative to the motion for repeal.  There are truths
which lie too deep for argument, - truths, to the establishment of
which the evidence of the senses, or the feelings of the heart, have
contributed more than the slow process of reasoning; - which are
graven in deeper characters than any that reason can either impress or
efface.  When Doctor Johnson was asked to refute the arguments for
the non-existence of matter, he stamped his foot upon the ground, and
exclaimed, "I refute them  thus."  When Mr. Canning heard the
first whisper in this House of a repeal of the Union, this was all the
answer he vouchsafed,-the eloquent and, indignant answer, the tones
of which are still familiar to my ear, -" Repeal the Union? IRestore
the Hleptarchy! "
Thirty-three years have now elapsed since the passing of the act of
Union;-- a short period, if you count by the lapse of time; but it is a
period into which the events of centuries have been crowded.  It
includes the commencement and the close of the most treimendous conflict which ever desolated the world.  Notwithstanding the then recent
convulsions in Ireland, - notwithstanding the dissatisfaction expressed
with the Union, - the United Ernpire, that had been incorporated only
three years before the commencement of the war, escaped the calalmities to which other Nations were exposed.  In our gallant armies no
distinction of Englishmen and IIishmen was known; none of the vile
jealousies, which this motion, if successful, would generate, impaired
the energies which were exerted by all in defence of a common country.  That country did not bestow its rewards with a partial hancL
It did not, because they were Irishmen, pay a less sinc'ere or less willing homage to the glorious memory of a Ponsonby and a Pakenhain.
Castlereagh and Canning fought in the same ranks with Pitt; and
Grattan took his place, in the great contests of party, by the side of
Fox.  The mnajestic oak of the forest was transplanted, but it shot its
roots deep in a richer and more congenial soil. Above all, to an Irishman - to that Arthur Wellesley, who, in the emphatic words of the
learned gentleman (Mr. Sheil), " eclipsed his military victories by the
splendor of his civil triumphs - to him  was commit;ed, with the
279'l;E STANDARD SPEAKER
umunimous assent and confidelce of a generous country, the great and
glorious task of effecting the deliverance of the world.  Who is that
Irishman, who, recollecting these things, has the spirit and the heart
to propose that Ireland shall be defirauded for the future of her share
of such high achievements; that to her the wide avenues to civil and
military glory shall be hereafter closed; that the faculties and ener.
gies of her sons shall be forever stunted by being cramped within the
paltry limits of a small island? Surely, Sir, we owe it to the memory
of the illustrious brave, who died in defending this great Empire from
dismemberment by the force and genius of Napoleon, at least to save
it from dismemberment by the ignoble enemies that now assail it!
126. AMERICAN MERCIIANT VESSELS, 1850. -Richard Cobden.
I SOMETIMES quote the United States of America; and, I think, in this
matter of national defence, they set us a very good example.  Does
anybody dare to attack that Nation?  There is not a more formidable
Power, in every sense of the word, - although you may talk of France
and Russia, - than the United States of Ameri-ca; and there is not a
statesman with a head on his shoulders who does not know it; and yet
the policy of the United States has been to keep a very small amount
of armed force in existence. At the present moment, they have not a
line-of-battle ship afloat, notwithstanding the vast extension of their
commercial marine.  Last year she recalled the last ship-of-war from
the Pacific; and I shall be very much astonished if you see another.
The People are well employed, and her taxation is light, which countries cannot have if they burden themselves withl the expense of these
enormous armaments.
Now, many persons appeal to the English Nation under the impression that they are a very pugnacious People.  I am not quite sure that
we are not.  I am not quite sure that my opponents do not sometimes
have the advantage over me in appealing to the ready-primed pugnacity of our fellow-countrymen.  I believe I am pugnacious myself;
butt what I want is, to persuade my countrymen to preserve their
pugilaciousness until somebody comes to attack them.  Be assured,
if you want to be prepared for future war, you will be better prepared
in the way that the United States is prepared, - by the enormous
number of merchant ships of large tonnage constantly building; in
thbe vast number of steamers turning out of the building-yards at New
York, - those enormous steamers, finer than any to be found in the
royal navies of any country on the continent of Europe, commonly
extending from fifteen hundred to sixteen hundred tons. If the spirit
of America were once aroused, and her resentment excited, her mercantile marine alone,-- the growth of commerce, the result of a low taxation, and a prosperous People, - her mercantile marine alone would be
more than a match for any war navy that exists on the contirent of'
EuropeSENA'TJXRIAL. -- HENRY.
127. IRESISTANCE TO BRITISH AGGRESSION.- Patrick Henry.
Patrick HIenry was born, May 29th, 1736, in Hanover county, Virginia. His fatLer was a
native of Aberdeen, in Scotland. Patrick's education was scanty, and he er.tered upon the practice of the law after only six weeks of preparation. But his powers of eloquence were remarkable. He was elected repeatedly to the most important offices in the gift of the People of Virginia. In 1788, he was a member of the Convention which met there to consider the Colistitution
of the United States, and exerted himself strenuously against its adoption. I-e died in 1799.
The Virgisnia Convention having, before them resolutions of a temporizing character towards
Great Britain, March 23d, 1775, Mr. Henry introduced others, manly and decided in their tone,
and providing that the Colony should be immediately put in a state of defence. These couniter
resolutions he supported in the following memorable speech, the result of which was their adoption. Of the effect of this speech, Mr. Wirt says, that, when H-Ienry took his seat, at its close,
" No murmur of applause was heard. The effect was too deep. After the trance of a moment,
several members started from their seats. The cry to arnms! seemed to quiver on every lip, and
gleam from every eye. They becale impatient of speech. Their souls were on fire for
action."
MR. PRESIDENT it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of Hope.
We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the
song of that siren, till she transforms us into beasts.     Is this the part
of wise mien, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?
Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see
not, and  having  ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern
our temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it
niay cost, I am willing to know the whole truth, - to know the worst,
and to provide for it!
I have but one lamnp, by which my feet are guided; and that is the
lamp of experience.    I know of no way of judging of the future but
by the past.   And, judging by the past, I wish to know what there
has been in the conduct of the British ministry, for the last ten years,
to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to
solace themselves and the House?        Is it that insidious smile with
which our petition has been lately received?     Trust it not, Sir; it will
prove a snare to your feet!      Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed
with a kiss! Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters
and darken our land.     Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of
love and reconciliation?   Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be
reconciled, that force must be called in to win back our love?
Let us not deceive ourselves, Sir.   These are the implements of war
and subjugation, - the last arguments to which Kings resort. I ask
Gentlemen, Sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to
force us to submission? (Can Gentlemen assign any other possible
motive for it?   Has Great Britain any enemy in this quarter of the
world, to call for all this accumnulation of navies and armies?     No, Sir,
she has none.   They are meant for us; they can be mieant for no other.
They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the
British  ministry have been     so long forging.     And what have we t
oppose to them?-       Shall we try argument?    Sir, we have been trying
that, for the lest ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon ths
subject?   Nothing.   We have held the subject up in every light of
which it is capable; but it has been all in vain.
Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?      What torms
281THE STANDARD SPEAKER..hall we find which have not already been exlhausted? Let us not, I,eseech you, Sir, deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we have done everything that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on.
W.e have petitioned, we have remonstrated, we have supplicated, we
have prostrated ourselves.before the Throne, and have implored its
interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the Ministry and Parliament.  Our petitions have been slighted, our remonstrances have pro.
d-uced additional violence and insult, our supplications have been (lisregarded, and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the
Throne.
In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace
and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we
wish to be free, - if we mean to preserve inviolate those ilestimable
privileges for which we have been so long contending,- if we mean
not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so
long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon
until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained, - we must
fight; I repeat it, Sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms, and to the
God of Hosts, is all that is left us,!
128. THE WAR INEVITABLE, MARCH, 1775.- Patrick Henry.
THEY tell us, Sir, that we are weak, - unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the
next week, or the next year?  Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house?
Shall we gather strength -:by irresolution and inaction?  Shall we
acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our
backs, and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies
shall have bound us hand and foot?  Sir, we are not weak, if we uake
a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in
our power.
Three millions of People, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in
such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force
which our enemy can send against us. Besides, Sir, we shall not fight
-ulr battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of Nations, and who will raise ulp friends to fight our battles for
us. The battle, Sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant,
the active, the brave. Besides, Sir, we have no election. If we were
base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest.
There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are
forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The
war is inevitable; and let it come! I repeat it, Sir, let it come!
It is in vain, Sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry,
peace, peace! - but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The
next gale that sweeps from the North will bring to our ears the, clash
of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why
itaid we here idle? What is it that Gentlemen wish? What woulaSENATORIAL. - HENRY.
they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at
the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know
not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty, oi
give me death!
129. RETU'RN OF BRITISII FUGITIVES, 1782. - Patrick Henry.
I VENTURE to prophesy, there are those now living who will see this
favored land amongst the most powerful on earth, - able, Sir, to take
care of herself, without resorting to that policy, which is always so
dangerous, though sometimes unavoidable, of calling in foreign aid.
]Yes, Sir, they will see her great in arts and in arms, - her golden
harvests waving over fields of immeasurable extent, her commerce
penetrating the most distant seas, and her cannon silencing the vain
boasts of those who now proudly affect to rule the waves. But, Sir,
you must have men, - you cannot get along without them. Those
heavy forests of valuable timber, under which your lands are groaning,
must be cleared away. Those vast riches which cover the face of your
soil, as well as those which lie hid in its bosom, are to be developed
and gathered only by the skill and enterprise of men. Your timber,
Sir, must be worked up into ships, to transport the productions of the
soil from which it has been cleared. Then, you must have commercial
men and commercial capital, to take off your productions, and find the
best markets for them  abroad. Your great want, Sir, is the want of
men; and these you must have, and will have speedily, if you are
wise.
Do you ask how you are to get them.?  Open your doors, Sir, and
they will come in! The population of the Old World is full to overflowing. That population is ground, too, by the oppressions of the
Governments under which they live.  Sir, they are already standing
on tiptoe upon- their native shores, and looking to your coasts with a
wistful and longing eye. They see here a land blessed with natural
and political advantages, which are not equalled by those of any other
country upon earth; - a land on which a gracious Providence hath
emiptied the horn of abundance, - a land over which Peace hath now
stretched forth her white wings, and where Content and Plenty lie
down at every door!
Sir, they see something still more attractive than all this. They
see a land in which Liberty hath taken up her abode, - that Liberty
whom they had considered as a fabled goddess, existing only in the
failcies of poets. They see her here a real divinity, - her altars rising
on every hand, throughout these happy States; her glories chanted by
three millions of tongues, and the whole region smiling under her
blessed influence. Sir, let but this, our celestial goddess, Liberty,
stretch forth her fair hand toward the People of the Old World,--
tell them to come, and bid theni welcome, - and you will see them
pouring in from the North, from the South, from the East, and from
the West.  Your wildernesses will be cleared and settled, your deserts

will smile,.our ranks will be filled, and you will soon be in a conditicm
to defy the powers of any adversary.
But Gentlemen object to any accession from Great Britain, and par
ticularly to the return of the British refugees.  Sir, I feel no objection
to the return of those deluded people. They have, to be sure,.mistaken
their own interests most wofully; and most wofally have they suffered
the punishment due to their offences.. But the relations which we bear
to them, and to their native country, are now changed.  Their King
hath acknowledged our independence; the quarrel is over, peace hath
returned, and found us a free People.  Let us have the magnanimity,
Sir, to lay aside our antipathies and prejudices, and consider the subject in a political light.  Those are an enterprising, moneyed people.
They will be serviceable in taking off the surplus produce of our lands,
and supplying us with necessaries, during the infant state of our m:anufactures.  Even if they be inimical to us in point of feeling and principle, I can see no objection, in a political view, in making them tributary to our advantage. And, as I have no prejudices to prevent my
making this use of them, so, Sir, I have no fear of any mischief that
they can do us.  Afraid of them! - What, Sir, shall we, who have
laid the proud British lion at our feet, now be afraid of his whelps?
130. SUPPOSEDI SPEECH OF JAMES OTIS.* -Mrs. L. M. Child.
ENGLAND may as well dam up the waters of the Nile with bulrushes
as fetter the step of Freedom, more proud and firm in this youathful
land than where she treads the sequestered glens of Scotland, or
couches herself among the magnificent mountains of Switzerland.
Arbitrary principles, like those against which we now contend, have
cost one King of England'his life, - another, his crown, - and they
may yet cost a third his most flourishing colonies.
We are two millions, --one-fifth fighting men. We are bold andJ
vigorous, - and we call no man master.  To the Nation from whom
we are proud to derive our origin we ever were, and we ever will be,
ready to yield unforced assistance; but it must not, and it never can
be, extorted.  Some have sneeringly asked, "Are the Americans too
poor to pay a few pounds on stamped paper?'  No! America, tlhanks
to God and herself, is rich.  But the right to take ten pounds implies
the right to take a thousand; and what must be the wealth that avarice,
aided by power, cannot exhaust? Trtie, the spectre is now small; but the
shadow he casts before him is huge enough to darken all this fair land
Others, in sentimental style, talk of the immense debt of gratitude
which. we owe to England.  And what is the amount of this debt?  
Why, truly, it is the same that the young lion owes to the dam, which
has brought it forth on the solitude of the mountain, or left it amid the
winds and storms of the desert.

teeth, because the fagot and torch were behind us. We have waked
this new world from its savage lethargy; forests have been prostrated
in our path; towns and cities have grown up suddenly as the flowers
of the tropics, and the fires in our autumnal woods are scarcely more
rapid than the increase of our wealth and population.  And do we owe
all this to the kind succor of the mother country? No! we owe it to
the tyranny that drove us from her,- to the pelting storms which
invigorated our helpless infancy.
Bu.t perhaps others will say, "We ask no money from your gratitude, -we only demand that you should pay your own expenses."
And who, I pray, is to judge of their necessity?  Why, the King, -
and, with all due reverence to his sacred majesty, he understands the
real wants of his distant subjects as little as he does the language of the
Choctaws! Who is to judge concerning the frequency of these
demanclds? The Ministry. Who is to judge whether the money is
properly expended?  The Cabinet behind the Throne.   In every
instance, those who take are to judge for those who pay. If this system is suffered to go into operation, we _all have reason to esteem it
a great privilege that rain and dew do not depend upon Parliament;
otherwise, they would soon be taxed and dried.  But, thanks to God,
there is' freedom enough left upon earth to resist such monstrous injustice! The flame of liberty is extinguished in Greece and Rome; but,
the light of its glowing embers is still bright and strong on the shores
of America. Actuated by, its sacred influence, we will resist unto
death.  But we will not countenance anarchy and misrule. The
wrongs that a desperate community have heaped upon their enemies
shall be amply and speedily repaired. Still, it may be well for some
proud men to remember, that a fire is lighted in these Colonies which
one breath of their King may kindle into such fury that the blood of
all England cannot extinguish it!
131. FOR INDEPENDENCE, 1776. --Richard Henry Lee. Born, 1732; died, 1794.
THE time will certainly come when the fated separation between the
mother country and these Colonies must take place, whether you will
or no; for so it is decreed by the very nature of things, - by the pro.
gressive increase of our population, the fertility of our soil, the extent
of our territory, the industry of our countrymen, and the immensity
of the ocean which separates the two countries. And, if this be true, -
as it is most true, - who does not see that the sooner it takes place, the
better; that it would be the height of folly, not to seize the present occasion, when British injustice has filled all hearts with indignation, inspired
all minds with courage, united all opinions in one, and put arms in
every hand? And how long must we traverse three thousand miles
of a' stolrmy sea, to solicit of arrogant and insolent men either counsels
or comlnands to regulate our donmestic affairs?  From what we have
already achieved, it is easy to presume what we shall hereafter accom

plis'.  Experience is the source of sage counsels, and liberty is the
mothir of great men. Have you not seen the enemy driven from
Lexington by citizens armed and assembled in one day?   Already
their most celebrated generals have yielded in Boston to the skill of
ours. Already their seamen, repulsed from our coasts, wander over the
ocean, the sport of tempests, and the prey of famine.  Let us hail the
favorable omen, and fight, not for the sake of knowing on what ternm
we are to be the slaves of England, but to secure to ourselves a free
existence, to found a just and independent Government.
Why do we longer delay, - why still deliberate?  Let this most
happy day give birth to the American Republic.  Let her arise, not
to devastate and conquer, but to reestablish the reign of peace and of
the laws.  The eyes of Europe are fixed upon us; she demands of us
a living example of freedom, that may contrast, by the felicity of the
citizens, with the ever-increasing tyranny which desolates her polluted
shores.  She invites us to prepare an asylum where the unhappy may
find solace, and the persecuted repose.  She entreats us to cultivate a
propitious soil, where that generous plant which first sprang up and
grew in England, but is now withered by the poisonous blasts of Scottish tyranny, may revive and flourish, sheltering under its salubrious
and interminable shade all the unfortunate of the human race.  This
is the end presaged by so many omens:--by our first victories; by the
present ardor and union; by the flight of Howe, and the pestilence
which broke out among Dunmore's people; by the very winds which
bafflecl the enemy's fleets and transports, and that terrible tempest
which engulfed seven hundred vessels upon the coasts of Newvfoundland. If we are not' this day wanting in our duty to country, the
names of the American Legislators will be placed, by posterity, at the
side of those of Theseus, of Lycurgus, of Romiilus, of Numa, of the
three Williams of Nassau, and of all those whose memory ha, been,
and will be, forever dear to virtuous men and good citizens  
132. THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION, 1787.--Benjamin Franklin. Born, 1706; died, 1790.
The following is strongly marked by the leading traits of Franklin's character,--his liberalit&gt;3,
practical wisdom, and spirit of compromise.
SIR, I agree to this Constitution, with all its faults, - if they are
such, - because I think a general Government necessary for us, and
there is no form of Government but what may be a blessing to the
People, if well administered; and I believe, further, that this is likely
to be well administered for a course of years, and can only end in
despotism, as other forms have done before it, when the People shall
become so corrupted as to need despotic Government, being incapable
of any other.  I doubt, too, whether any other convention we can
obtain may be able to make a better Constitution.  For, when you
assemble a number of men, to have the advantage of their joint wisdom, you inevitably assemble with those men all their prejudices, their
passions, their errors of opinion, their local in%rests, and their selfish
286SENATORIAL. - FR&amp;NKLIN,
vie-ws. Frolm.uch an assembly can a perfect production be expected?
[t, therefore, astonishes me,--Sir, to find this system  approaching sq
near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our eneimies,
wh(, are waiting with confidence to hear that our counsels are confoun qed, like those of the builders of Babel, and that our States are on
the point of separation, only to meet hereafter for the purpose of cut.
ting one another's throats.
Thus I consent, Sir, to this Constitution, because I expect no better,
and because I am not sure that this is not the best..The opinions I
have had of its errors I sacrifice to the public good.  I have nevei,hispered a syllable of them abroad.  Within these walls they were
born, and here they shall die.  If every one of us, in returning to his
constituents, were to report the objections he has had to it, and endeavor
to gain partisans in support of them, we might prevent its being generally received, and thereby lose all the salutary effects and great advantages resulting naturally in our favor among foreign Nations, as well
as among ourselves, from our real or apparent unanimity.  Much of
the strength and efficacy of any Government, in procuring and securing happiness to the People, depends on opinion,-- on the general opinion of the goodness of that Government, as well as of the wisdom and
integrity of its Governors.  I hope, therefore, that, for our own sakes,
as a part of the People, and for the sake of our posterity, we shall act
heartily and unanimously in recommenrding this Constitution, wherever
our influence may extend, and turn our future thoughts and endeavors
to the means of having it well administered.
133. GOD GOvEIRNS. - Benjamin Franklin, 1787, in Convention.
IN this situation of this Assembly,- groping, as it were, in the dark,
to find political truth, and scarce able to distinguish it when presented
to us, - how has it happened, Sir, that we have not hitherto once
thought of humbly applying to the Father of Light to illuminate our
understanding?  In the beginning of the contest with Britain, when
we were sensible of danger, we had daily prayers in this room for the
divine protection.  Our prayers, Sir, were heard,--and they were
graciously answered. All of us who were engaged in the struggle
must have observed frequent instances of a superintending Providence
in our favor.  To that kind Providence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the means of establishing our future
national felicity.  And have we now forgotten that powerful Friend?
or do we imagine we no longer need His assistance?  I have lived,
Sir, a long time; and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I
see of this truth, - that God governs in the affairs of men.  And,
if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid?  We have been assured,
Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that " except the Lord build the house,
they labor in vain that build it."  I firmly believe this; and I also
believe thlat, without His concurring aid, we shall s ecceed in this polit.
287MODULATION OF THaE VOICE.
with.pleasure to others, it is a necessary accomplishment. A voice which
keeps long in one key, however correct the pronunciation, delicate th3 inflection, and just the emphasis, will soon tire the hearer. The voice has been
considered as capable of assuming three keys, - the low, the high, and the middle. This variety is undoubtedly too limited; but, foer the first lessons of a
student, it may be useful to regard the classification. A well-trained voice
is capable of ranging in these with various degrees of loudness, softness, stress,
continuity, and rapidity.
These different state, of the voice, properly managed, give rise to that stri-.
ing and beautiful variety which is essential to eloquent delivery. The difference between loud and soft, and high and low tones, should be well understood.
Piano andforte have no relation to pitch or key, but to force and quantity;
and, when applied to the voice, they relate to the body or volume which the
speaker or singer gives out. We can, therefore, be very soft in a high note,
and very loud in a low one; just as a smart stroke on a bell may have ex
actly the same note as a slight one, though it is considerably louder. It ought
to be a first principle, with all public readers and speakers, rather to begin
below tlhe common level of the voice than above it. A good practical rule for
-the speaker, in commencing, is to speak as if he would have his voice reach
those in the centre of the hall. He thus will begin on a level tone, from which
he may easily rise. Some abrupt forms of speech require, however, a loud
tone of voice, even at the commencement, to give them their due effect; as, for
instance: " How long, O Catiline! wilt thou abuse our patience?"
Theright assumption of the keys constitutes what may be termed thefeeling
of a composition; -without it, actino, is lifeless, and argument tiresome. It is
a want of this variety which distinguishes the inanimate speaker. His inflection may be. correct, and have even what has been termed a musical cadence;
but, without this variety of key, he must tire his audience. The effect of a
transition from the major to the minor key in music is not more striking than
the variety which the voice will occasionally assume. A change of key is generally necessary at the commencement of a new sentence. When, in the preceding sentence, the voice has.sunk down towards the close, in the new sentence
it sometimes recovers its elasticity, and sometimes it continues in the depressed
note on which the preceding sentence terminates.
In common conversation, our tonie is light, and appears to come from the
lip; in serious and impressive speaking, it appears to be formed further back,
and is accompanied by a greater tension of the muscles of the throat. The
deeper formation of the voice is the secret of that peculiar tone which is found
in actors and orators of celebrity. Some have this voice n;.itLrally; but the
greater number must acquire it by assiduous practice. Thoe pupil must be
required to speak " further down in the throat."  This peculiar voice, which
is adapted to the expression of what is solemn, grand and exciting, "is formed
in those parts of the mouth posterior to the palate, bounded below by the root
of the tongue, above by the commencement of the palate, behind by the most
posterior part of the throat, and on the sides by the angles of the jaw. The
tengue, in the mean time, is hollowed and drawn back; and the mouth is
opened in such a manner as to favor, as much as possible, the enlargement of
the cavity described."
LOW KEY.
To acquire strength and distinctness in this key, the remarks in the last
paragraph will be found useful. Nothing more unequivocally marks the finished speaker than a command over the low notes of his voice; it is a rare
accomplishment, but one which is a most valuable principle in Oratory
Strengthening the low notes, after forming them, should be a great object with
the master in Eiocution; but it too often happens that the acquisition of a
screaming high note is reckoned the desideratum. in speaking. The difficulty
of being distinct and audible in the low key is at first discourag,ng; but prac27TIIE. STANDARD SPEAKER.

134. iN FAYOR OF A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.- Supposed Speech of
John Adams, in the Continental Congress, July, 1776.
The subjoined two extracts are from "A Discourse in commemoration of the Lives and Services
of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, by Daniel Webster, delivered in Faneuil I-all, Boston,
Augfust 2, 1826." The sentiment and spirit of this "supposed" speech appear to be partially
taken from a. letter which John Adams wrote to a friend, the day after the Declaration, and in
which he said: " Yesterday the greatest question was decided that was ever debated in America; ansd greater, perhaps, never was or will be decided by men. A resolution was passed, with
out one dissenting colony,' that these United States are, and of right ought to be, free and inde
p)endent States.' The day is passed. The Fourth of July, 1776, will be a nmemorable epocha i:
the history of America. I am apt to believe it will be celebrated, by succeeding generations, as
the grieat anniversary festival. It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverlance, by
solemn acts of devotion to Almighty God. It ought to be solemnized with pomp, shows, games,
sports, guns. bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of the continent to the other, from
this time forward, forever. You will think me transported with enthusiasm, but I am not. I
am well aware of the toil, and blood, and treasure, that it vill cost to maintain this declaration.
and support aid defend these States; yet, through all the gloom, I can see the rays of light and
glory. I can see that the end is worth more than all the means; and that posterity will triumph,
although you and I may rue,- -which, I hope, we shall not."
By a felicitous coincidlence, Adams and Jefferson died on the 4th of July, 1826, the anniversary of the occasion which they had done so much to render memorable.
SINK or swim, live or dclie, survive or perish, I give my hand and
my heart to this vote!    It is true, indeed, that, in the beginning, we
aimed not at independence.     But there is a Divinity which shapes our
ends.   The injustice of England has driven us to arms; and, blinded
to her own interest for our good, she has obstinately persisted, till
independence is now within our grasp. We have but to reach forth
to it, and it is ours.  Why, thlen, should we defer the Declaration I
Is any man so weak as now to hope for a reconciliation with England,
which  shall leave either safety to the country and its liberties, ot
safety to his own life, and his own honor? Are not you, Sir, who sit
in that chair, -is not he, our venerable colleague near you,-are not
both already the proscribed and predestined objects of punishment and
of vengeance?      Cut off from   all hope of royal clemency, what are
you, what can you be, while the power of England remains, but outlaws?
If we postpone independence, do we mean to carry on, or give up,
the war?    Do we mean to submit to the measures of Parliament,
Boston port-bill and all?     Do we mean to subuiit, and consent that
we ourselves shall be ground to powder, and our country and its rights
trodden down in the dust? I know we do not mean to submit. We
never shall submit. Do we intend to violate that most solemn obligation ever entered into by men,-      that plighting, before G od, of our
sacred honor to Washington, when, putting himn forth to incur the
dangers of war, as well as the political hazards of the timnes, we prow,

ised to adhere to him, in every extremity, with our fortunes and our
lives?
I know there is not a man here who would not rather see a general
conflagration sweep over the land, or an earthquake sinlk it, than one
jot or tittle of that plighted faith fall to the ground.  For myself;
having, twelve months ago, in this place, moved you that George
Washington be appointed commander of the forces raised, cr to be
raised, for defence of American liberty, may my right hand forget its
cunning, and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I hesitate
or waver in the support I give him! The war, then, must go on. We
must fight it through.
And. if the war must go on, why put off longer the Declaration of
Independence?  That measure will strengthen us.  It will give us
character abroad. The Nations will then treat with us, which they
never can do while we ackhow1Adge ourselves subjects in arms against
our sovereign. Nay, I maintain that England herself will sooner treat
for peace with us on the footing of independence, than consent, by
repealing her acts, to acknowledge that her whole conduct t:owards us
has been a course of injustice and oppression. Her priide will be less
wounded by submitting to that course of things which now predestinates our independence, than by yielding the points in controversy to
her rebellious subjects. The former she would regard as the result of
fortune; the latter, she would'feel as her own deep disgrace.  Why,
then, Sir, do we not, as soon as possible, change this fiom a civil to a
national war? And, since we must fight it thirough, wly not put ourselves in a state to enjoy all the benefits of victory, if' we gain the victory?  If we fail, it can be no worse for. us.  But we shall not fail!
135. CONCLUSION OF TIHE P.ECOEDING.
TuHE cause will.raise up arnnies; - the cause will create navies.
The people, - the people, - if we are true to them, will carry us,
and will carry themselves, gloriously through this struggle.  I care
not how fickle other people have been found.  I know the people of
these colonies; and I know that resistanlce to British aggression is' deep
and settled in their hearts, and cannot be eradicated.  Every colony
indeed, has expressed its willingness to follow, if we but take the lead.
Sir, the Declaration will inspire the people with increased courage.
Instead of a long and bloody war for restoration of privileges, fbr
redress of grievances, for chartered immunities, held under a Britishi
king, set before them the glorlious object of entire independence, and it
will breathe into them anew the breath of life. Read this Declaration
at the head of the army; - every sword will be drawn fromn its scab
bard, and the solemn vctw uttered, to maintain it, or to perish on the
bed of honor.  PuLblishl it from the Pulpit;-- religion will approve it,
and the love of religious liberty will cling round it, resolved to stand

them  see it who saw their brothers and their sons fall on the fiell of
Bunker Hill, and in the streets of Lexington and Concord, -  and the
very walls will cry out in its support!
Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs; but I see clearly
through  this day's business.  You and I, indeed, may rue it.    We
may not live to see the time when this Declaration shall be made good.
We may die, -   die colonists; die slaves; die, it may be, ignominiously,
and on the scaffold!   Be it so! be it so!  If it be the pleasure of
Heaven that my country shall require the poor offering of my life, the
victim shall be ready at the appointed hour of sacrifice, come when
that hour may.   But, while I do live, let me have a country, - or, at!east, the hope of a country, and that a free country.
But, whatever may be our fate, be assured that this Declaration
will stand. It may cost treasure, and it may cost blood; but it will
stand, and it will richly compensate for both.    Through the thick
gloom of the'present, I see the brightness of the future, as the sun in
Heaven. We shall make this a glorious, an immortal day.     When we
are in our graves, our children will honor it.  They will celebrate it
with  thanksgiving, with  festivity, with bonfires, and illuminations.
On its annual return, they will shed tears, -  copious, gushing tears,
not of subjection and slavery, not of agony and distress,- but of
exultation, of gratitude, and of joy. Sir, before God, I belie've the
hour is come!    My judgmenlt approves this measure, and my whole
heart is in it.  All that I have, and all that I am, and all that I hope,
in this life, I am now ready here to stake upon it; and I leave off, as
I began, that, live or die, survive or perish, I am for the Declaration'
It is my living sentiment, and, by the blessing of God, it shall be my
dying sentiment,- INDEPENDENCE now, and INDEPENDENCE FOREVER!
136. TIE GENERAL GOVERNM1ENT AND THE cTATES. - Alexander Hamilton.
Alexander Hlamilton was born in Nevis, one of the West India Islands, in 1757. After some
military experieiice, he entered upon the study of the law, and rose to great eminence in the
councils of the Nation. With Madison and Jay, he wrote the "Federalist," and labored( strenulously in behalf of the Conrstitution. He was the first Secretary of the Treasury of the United
States. He was shot by Aaron Burr, in a duel, in 1801. The two following speeches were delivered in the Convention of New York, on the adoption of the Constitution, 1788.
MR. (CHAIRMAN, it has been advanced as a principle, that no Government but a Despotism can exist in a very extensive country. This
is a melancholy consideration, indeed.  If it were founded on truth,
we ought to dismiss the idea of a Republican Government, even for
the State of New York.     But the position has been misapprehended.
its application relates only to democracies, where the body of the Peo
ple n-eet to transact business, and where representation is unknown.
The application is wrong in respect to all representative Governments;
but especially in relation to a Confederacy of States, in which the
Supremie Legislature has only general powers, and the civil and domestic concerns of the People are regulated by the laws of the several
States.   I insist that it never can be the interest or desire of the
national Legislature to dlestroy the State Governments.    The blow

aimel at the memlbers must give a" fatal wound to the head, and the
destruction of the States must be at once a political suicide.  But
imagine, for a moment, that a political frenzy should seize the Governmant; suppose they should make the attempt.   Certainly, Sir, it
would be forever impracticable.  This has been sufficiently demonstrated by reason and experience.  It has been proved that the members of Republics have been, and ever will be, stronger than the head.
let us attend to one general historical example.
In the ancient feudal Governments of Europe, there were, in the
first place, a Monarch; subordinaSe to him, a body of Nobles; and
subject to these, the vassals, or the whole body of the People.  The
authority of the Kings was limited, and that of the Barons considerably independent.  The histories of the feudal wars exhibit little more
than a series of successful encroachments on the prerogatives of Monarchy.
Here, Sir, is one great proof of the superiority which the members
in limited Governments possess over their head.  As long as the
Barons enjoyed the confidence and attachment of the People, they had
the strength of the country on their side, and were irresistible. I may
be told in some instances the Barons were overcome; but how did this
happen?  Sir, they took advantage of the depression of the royal
authority, and the establishment of their own power, to oppress and
tyrannize over their vassals. As commerce enlarged, and wealth and
civilization increased, the People began to feel their own weight and
consequence; they grew tired of their oppressions; united their
strength with that of their Prince, and threw off the yoke of Aristocracy. These very instances prove what I conteind for. They prove
that in whatever direction the popular weight leans, the current of
power will flow; whatever the popular attachments be, there will rest
the political superiority.  Sir, can it be supposed that the State Governments will become the oppressors of the People? Will they forfeit
their affections? Will they combine to destroy the liberties and happiness of their fellow-citizens, for the sole purpose of involving themselves in ruin? God forbid! The idea, Sir, is shocking! It outrages
every feelirng of humanity, and every dictate of common sense!
137. CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. -Alexander Hamilton.
AFTER all our doubts, our suspicions and speculations, on the sub.
je,t of Government, we must return, at last, to this important truth,
- that, when we have formed a Constitution upon free principles,
when we have given a proper balance to the different branches of
Administration, and fixed Representation upon pure and equaleprinci
ples, we may, with safety, furnish it with all the powers necessary to
answfer, in the most ample manner, the purposes of Government.  The
great desiderata are a free Representation, and mutual checks. When
these are obtained, all our apprehensions of the extent of powers are
unjust ind imaginar'y.  What, then, is the structure of this ConstituTHE STANDARD SPEAKER.
tion?  One branch of the Legislature is to be elected by the People
- by the same People wno choose your State. Representatives. Its
members are to hold their office two years, and then return to their
constituents.  Here, Sir, thle People govern.  Here they act by their
immediate Representatives.  You have also a Senate, constituted by
your State Legislatures, -by men in whom you place the highest confidence,- and forming another Representative branch.  Then, again,
you have an Executive Magistrate, created by a form of election whichrmerits universal admiration.
In the form of this Government, and in the mode of Legislation,
you find all the checks which the gre[atest politicians andcl:the best
wri,ers have ever conceived.  What mol'e can reasonable men desire?
I thIhere any one branch in which the whole Legislative and Executive
powers. are lodgecl?  No!   The Legislative authority is lodged in
three distinct branches, properly balanced; the Executive authority is
divided between two branches; and the Judicial is still reserved:or an
independent body, who hold their office during good behavior.  This
organization is so complex, so skilfully contrived, that it is next to
impossible that an impolitic or wicked measure should pass the great
scrutiny with success.  Now, what do Gentlemen mean, by coming forward and declaiming against this Government?  Why do they say we
ought to limit its powers, to disable it, and to destroy its capacity of
blessing the People?    Has philosophy suggested, has'experience
taught, that such a Government ought not to be trusted with everything necessary for the good of society?'Sir, when you have divided
and nicely balanced the departments of Government; when you have
strongly.connected the virtue of your rulers with their interests; when,
in short, you have rendered your system as perfect as human forms can
be, - you must place confidence; you must give power.
138. ARISTOCRACY, 1788.--Robert-R. Livingston. Born, 1748; died, 1813.
TIE gentleman, who has so copiously declaimed against all declamation, has pointed his artillery against the rich and great.  WVe are told
that, in every country, there is a natural Aristocracy, and that this
Aristocracy consists of the rich and the great. Nay, the gentleman
goes further, and ranks in this class of men the wise, the learned, and
those eminent for their talents or great virtues.  Does a man possess
the confidence of his fellow-citizens, for having done them inmportant
services?  He is an Aristocrat! Has he great integrity?  He is an.Aristocrat! Indeed, to determine that one is an Aristocrat, we need
only to be assured that he is a man of merit. But I hope we have
many such.   So sensible am I of that gentleman's talents, integrity,
and virtue, that we might at once hail him the first of the Nobles, the
very Prince of the Senate!
But whom, in the name of common sense, would the gentleman
nave to represent'us?  Not the rich, for they are sheer Aristo, rats
292SENATORIAL - RANDOLIll.
YTot the learned, the wise, the virtuous; for they are all Aristocrats.
Whom then?   Wlhy, those who are not virtuous; those who are not
wise; those who are not learned; -- these are the men to whom alone
we can trust our liberties! Iie says, further, we ought not to choose
Aristocrats, because the People will not have confidence in them.
That is to say, the People will not have confidence in those who best
deserve and most possess their confidence! He would have his Government composed of other classes of men.  Where will he ficnd them I
Why, he must go forth into the highways, and pick up the rogue and
the robber.  He nmust go to the hedges and the ditches, and bring in
the poor, the blind, and the lame. As the gentleman has thus settled
the definition of Aristocracy, I trust that no man will think it a term
of reproach; for who, among us, would not be wise? who would not
be virtuous? who would not be above want? The truth is, in these
Republican Governments, we know no such ideal distinctions.  We
are all equally Aristocrats. Offices, emoluments, honors, the roads to
preferment and to wealth, are alike open to all.
139. EXTENT OF COUNTRY NO BAR TO UNION. -Edmund Randolph. Died, 1813.
In the Virginia Convention on the Federal Constitution, 1788.
EXTENT of country, in my conception, ought to be no bar to the
adoption of a good Government.'No extent on earth seems to me too
great, provided the laws be wisely made and executed. The principles
of representation and responsibility may pervade a large, as well as a
small territory; and tyranny is as easily introduced into a small as
into a large district.  Union, Mr. Chairman, is the rock of our salvation.  Our safety, our political happiness, our existence depend on
the Union of these States. Without Union, the People of this and the
other States will undergo the unspeakable calamities which discord,
faction, turbulence, war and bloodshed, have continually produced in
other countries. Without Union, we throw away all those blessings
for which we have so earnestly fought. Without Union, there is no
peace, Sir, in the land.
The American spil'it ought to be mixed with American pride,
pride to see the Union magnificently triumph. Let that glorious pride
which once defied the British thunder reainimate you again.  Let it
not be recorded of Americans, that, after having performed the most
gallant exploits, after having overcome the most astonishing diffi.
etulties, and after having gained the admiration of the world by
their incomparable valor and policy, they lost their acquired reputation, lost their national consequence and happiness, by their
own indiscretion.  Let no future historian inform  posterity that
Americans wanted wisdom and virtue to concur in any regular, efficient, Government.  Catch the present momient.    Seize it with
avidity.  It may be lost, never to be regained; and, if the Union be
lost now, I fear it will remain so forever!THE STANDARD SPEAKLIR.

Reply, as President of the United States, January lst, 1796, to the address of the Ministes
Plenipotentiary of the French Republic, on his presenting the colors uf France to the United
States.
BORN, Sir, in a land of liberty; having early learned its value  
&amp;Aving engaged in a perilous conflict to defend it; having, in a word.
devoted the best years of my life to secure its permanent establishment
in my own country, - my anxious recollections, my sympathetic feelings, and iny best wishes, are irresistibly excited, whensoever, in any
country, I see an oppressed Nation unfurl the banners of freedom.
But, above all, the events of the French Revolution have produced the
deepest solicitude, as well as the highest admiration.  To call your
Nation brave, were to pronounce but common praise.    Wonderful
-People! Ages to come will read with astonishment the history of
your brilliant exploits! I rejoice that the period of your toils and of
your immense sacrifices is approaching.  I rejoice that the interesting
revolutionary movements of so many years have issued in the formation of a Constitution designed to give permanency to the great object
for which you have contended. I rejoice that liberty, which you have
so long embraced with enthusiasm, - liberty, of which you have been
the invincible defenders, - now finds an asylum in the bosom of a regularly organized Government; - a Government, which, being formed
to secure the happiness of the French People, corresponds with the
ardent wishes of my heart, while it gratifies the pride of every citizen
of the United States, by its resemblance to his own.   On these
glorious events, accept, Sir, my sincere congratulations.
In delivering to you these sentiments, I express not my own feelings only, but those of my fellow-citizens, in relation to the commencement, the progress, and the issue, of the French Revolution; and
they will cordially join with me in purest wishes to the Supreme
Being, that the citizens of our sister Republic, our magnanimous
allies, may soon enjoy in peace that liberty which they have purchased at so great a price, and all the happiness which liberty can
bestow.
I receive, Sir, with lively sensibility, the symbol of the triumphs
and of the enfranchisement of your Nation, the colors of France,
which you have now presented to the United States. The transaction
will be announced to Congress; and the colors will be deposited with
those archives of the United States which are at once the evidences
and the memorials of their freedom and independence.  May these be
perpetual! And may the friendship of the two Republics be commensurate with their existence!
141. AGAINST FOREIGN ENTANGLEMENTS, 1796.--George Washington.
AGAINST the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to.
believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free People ought to be
constantly awake1; since history and experience prove that foreign
291SENATORIAL. - AIES.
influence is one of the most baneful foes of Republican Government.
But that jCalousy, to be useful, must be impartial; else it becomes the
instrument of the very influence to be avoided, instoad of a defence
against it. Excessive partiality for one Nation, and excessive dislike
for another, cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one
side; e,and serve to veil, and even second, the arts of influence on th6
otfher.  Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite.; re
liable to become suspected and odious; while its tools and dupes usurp
the applause and confidence of the People, to surrender their
interests.  The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreigr
Nations, is, in extending our commercial relations, to have with them
as little political connection as possible. So far as we have already
formed engagements, let them   be fulfilled with perfect good faith.
Here let us stop.
Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none. or a
very remote relation.  Hence, she inust be engaged in frequent ccntroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns.
Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by
artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.  Our
detatched and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a
different course. If we remain one People, under an efficient Government, the period is not far off when we may defy material iinjury from
external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will
cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent Nations, under the impossibility of
making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us
provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided
by justice, shall counsel. Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a
situation?  Why quit our own to stand on foreign ground?   Why,
by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle
our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship,
interest, humor or caprice?
142. SANCTITY OF TREATIES, 1796. -Fisher Ames.
Fisher Ames, one of the most eloquent of American Statesmen and writers, was born in.)edham, Massachusetts, 1758, and died July. 4, 1808. He was a member of Congress during
L.Ae eight years of Washington's administration, of which he was the earnest and able champion.
WE are either to execute this treaty, or break our faith.  To expastiate on the value of public faith may pass with some men for declamation: to such men I have nothing to say. To others, I will urge,
can any circumstance mark upon a People more turpitude and
debasement? Can anything tend more to make men think themselves
mean,- or to degrade to a lower point their estimation of virtue, and
their standard of action? It would not merely demoralize mankind;
it tenlds to break all the ligaments of society; to dissolve that mysterious charm which attracts individuals to the Nation; and to inspire
in it- stead. a repulsive sense of shame and disgust.THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
*Wnat is patriotism?  Is it a narrow affection for the spot whwoe a
man was born? Are the very clods where we tread e'ltitled to this
ardent prefelence, because they are greener? No, Sir; this is not the
character of the virtue.  It soars higher fbr its object.  It is an
ex.ended self-love, mingling with all the enjoyments of life, and
twisting itself with the minutest filaments of the heart.  It is thuq
we obey the laws of society, because they are the laws of virtue. In
their authority we see, not the array of force and terror, but the
venerable image of our country's honor.  Every good citizen makes
that honor his own, and cherishes it, not only as precious, but as
sacred. I-e is willing to risk his life in its defence, and is conscious
that he gains protection while he gives it; for what rights of a citizen
will be deemed inviolable, when a State renounces the principles that
constitute their security?  Or, if his life should not be invaded, what
would its enjoyments be, in a country odious in the eye of strangers,
and dishonored in his own?.Could he look with affection and veneration to such a country, as his parent?  The sense of having one
would die within him: he would blush for his patriotism, if he
retained any, - and justly, for it would be a vice. He would be a
banished man in his native land.  I see no exception to the respect
that is paid among Nations to the law of good faith. It is the philosophy of politics, the religion of Governments. It is observed by
barbarians.  A whiff of tobacco-smoke, or a string of beads, gives
not merely binding force, but sanctity, to treaties. Even in Algiers,
a truce may be bought for money; but, when ratified, even Algiers is
too wise, or too just, to disown and annul its obligation.

ARE the posts of our frontier to remain forever in the possession of
Great Britain?  Let those who reject them, when the treaty offers
them  to our hands, say, if they choose, they are of no importance.
Will the tendency to Indian hostilities be contested by any one?
Experience gives the answer. Am I reduced to the necessity of
proving this point?  Certainly the very men who charged the Indian
war on the detention of the posts will call for no other proof' than the
recital of their owii speeches.  "Until the pests are rest6red," they
exclaimed, " the treasury and the frontiers must bleed."  Can Gentlemen now say that an Indian peace, without the posts, will prove firm?
No, Sir, it will not be peace, but a sword; it will be no better than a
lure to draw victims within the reach of the tomahawk.
On this theme, my emotions are unutterable. If I could find words
for them, if my powers bore any proportion to my zeal, I would swell
my voice to such a note of remonstrance, i; should reach every loghouse beyond the mountains.  I would say to the inhabitants, Wake
from  your false security! Your cruel dangers, your more cruel
apprehensions, are soon to be renewed. The wounids, yet unhealed,
29QSENATGRIAL. - JEFFERSON..re to be torn open aguin. In the day-time, your path through the
woods will be ambushed.  The darkness of midnight will glitter with
the blaze of your dwellings. You are a father, - the blood of your
cons shall fatten your corn-fields!  You are a mother, - the war
whoop shall wake the sleep of the cradle!
Who will say that I exaggerate the tendencies of our measules?
Will any one answer, by a sneer, that all this is idle preaching? Will
any one deny that we are bound, and, I would hope, to good purpose,
by the most solemn sanctions of duty, for the vote we give?  Are
despots alone to be reproached for unfeeling indifference to the tears
and blood of their subjects?  Are republicans irresponsible?  Can
you put the dearest interest of society at risk, without guilt, and
without remorse? It is vain to offer, as an excuse, that public men
are not to be reproached for the evils that may happen to ensue from
their measures.  This is very true, where they are unforeseen  or
inevitable.  Those I have depicted are not unforeseen; they are so
far from inevitable, we are goilng to bring them into being by our
vote.  We choose the consequences, and become as justly answerable
for them as for the measure that we know will produce them.
By rejecting the posts, we light the savage fires, we bind the victims.  This day we undertake to render account to the widows and
orphans whom our decision will make; - to the wretches that will
be roasted at the stake; to our country, and, I do not deem  it too
serious to say, to conscience and to God, we are answerable; and, if
duty be anything more than a word of imposture, if conscience be not
a bugbear, we are preparing to make'ourselves as wretched as our
country.  There is no mistake in this case.  There can be none.
Experience has already been the prophet of events, and the cries of
our future victims have already reached us.  The Western inhabitants
are not a silent and uncomplaining sacrifice.  The voice of humanity
issues from the shade of the wilderness.  It exclaims, that, while one
hand is held up to reject this treaty, the other grasps a tomnahalwk.
It summons our imagination to the scenes that will open.  It is no
great effort of the imagination to conceive that events so near are
already begun. I can fancy that I listen to the yells of savage
vengeance, and the shrieks of torture! Already they seem to sigh in
the Western wind! Already they mingle with every echo from the
mountains!

In shape and gesture proudly eminent,

All her original brightness, nor appeare,
Less than archangel ruined, and the excess
Of glory obscured: as when the sun new-risen

The fo'lowing passage, in which King John takes Hubert aside, and tempt
him to undertake the death of Arthur, requires, in the enunciation, a full, audi.
ble tone of voice, in a low key:
K. John. I had a thing to say, - but let it go;
The sun is in the Heaven, and the proud day,
Attended with the pleasures of the world,
Is all too wanton and too full of gauds
To give me audience. If the midnight bell
Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
Sound one unto ttie drowsy race of night:
If this same were a church-yard where we stand,
And thou possess6d with a thousand wrongs;
- Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
IIear me without thine ears, and make reply
Without a tongue, using conceit alone, -
Without eyes, ears, and harmiful sound of words, -
Then, in despite of broad-eyed watchful day,
I would into thy bosom pour my thouglits.

And, by my troth, I think thou lov'st me well!

difference of opinion is not a difference of principle.  We have called
by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans: we are all Federali3ts.  If there be any among us who
would wish to dissolve this Union, or to change its republican form,
let them stand, undisturbed, as monuments of the safety with which
error of opinion may be tolerated, where reason is left free to combat
it. I know, indeed, that some honest men fear a republicanl Govern~
mnent cannot be strong, - that this Government is not strong enough.
But would the honest patriot, in the full tide of successful experiment,
abandon a Government which has so fhr kept us free and firm, on the
theoretic and visionary fear that this Government, the world's best
hope, may, by possibility, wanit energy to preserve itself?  I trust
not.  I believe this, on the contrary, the strongest Government on
earth.  I believe it the only one where every man, at the call
of the law, would fly to the standard of the law, and would meet
invasions of the public order, as his own personal concern. Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of
himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others? Or
have we found angels, in the form of Kings, to govern him? Let
history answer this question.
Let us, then, with courage and confidence, pursue our own Federal
and Republican principles --our attachment to Union and representative Government.  Kindly separated, by nature and a wide ocean,
from the exterminating havoc of one quarter of the globe, - too highminded to endure the degradations of the others, - possessing a chosen
country, with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and
thousandth generation, - entertaining a due sense of our equal right
to the use of our own faculties, to the acquisitions of our own
industry, to honor and confidence from our fellow-citizens, resulting not from birth, but from our actions, and their sense of them, -
enlightened by a benign religion, professed, indeed, and practised in
various forms, yet all of them inculcating honesty, truth, temperance,
gratitude, and the love of man, -acknowledging and adoring an
overruling Providence, which, by all its dispensations, proves that it
delights in the happiness of man here, and his greater happiness hereafter: with all these blessings, what more is necessary, to make us a
happy and prosperous People?
Still one thing more, fellow-citizens: a wise and frugal Government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave
them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and
improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread
it has earned. This is the sum of good government; andc this ii
necessary to close the circle of our felicities.

298SENATORIAL. -- MORRIS.'iable to be m the hands of the Judges.    Is it not our great initerest
to place our Judges upon such high ground that no fear can intimi
Aate, no hope seduce them?   The present measure humbles them in
the dust   It prFostrates them at the feet of faction.  It renders them
the tool of every dominant party. It is this effect which I deprecate.
It is this consequence which I deeply deplore. What does reason,
what does argument avail, when party spirit presides? Subject your
Bench to the influence of this spirit, and justice bids a final adieu to
your tribunals.   We are asked, Sir, if the Judges are to be independent of the People? The question presents a false and delusive
view.  We are all the People.   We are, and as long as we enjoy our
freedom, we shall be, divided into parties..   The true    question is,
Shall the Judiciary be permanent, or fluctuate with the tide of public
opinion? I beg, I implore gentlemen to consider the magnitude and
value of the principle which they are about to annihilate.     If your
Judges are independent of political changes, they may have their
preferences, but they will not enter into the spirit of party. But, let
their existence depend upon the support of a certain set of men, and
they cannot be impartial. Justice will be trodden under foot. Your
Courts will lose all public confidence and respect.
We are standing on the brink of that revolutionary torrent which
deluged in blood one of the fairest countries in Europe.   France had
her National Assembly, more numerous and equally popular with-our
own.   She had her tribuuals of justice, and her juries.       But the
Legislature and her Courts were but the instruments of her destruction. Acts of proscription, and sentences of banishment and death,
were passed in the Cabinet of a tyrant.     Prostrate your Judges at
the feet of party, and you break down the mounds which defend you
from this torrent! Are gentlemen disposed to risk the consequences?
146. ON THE JUDICIARY ACT, 1802. - Gouverneur Morris.
Gouverneur;Morris, born at Morrisania, New York, January 31st, 1752, died November 6th,
1818. He was a Delegate to the Continental Congress from New York, and subsequently represented that State in the Senate of the United States, before which body the following speeches
were delivered. IIe was, for some time, minister from the UT:nited States to France, and during
his residence in Europe formed the acquaintance of many historical personages, concerning
whom he has given interesting facts, in his published diary and letters.
WHAT will be the situation of these States, organized as they now
are, if, by the dissolution of our national compact, they be left to
themselves?   What is the probable result?    We shall either be the
victims of foreign' intrigue, and, split into factions, fall under the
domination of a foreign power,. or else, after the misery and torment
of a civil war, become the subjects'of an usurping military despot.
What but this compact, what but this specific part of it, canl save us
from ruin?  The judicial power, that fortiess of the Constitution, is
now to be overturned.    With honest Ajax, I would not only throw a
shield before it, -  I would build around it a wall of brass.  But I am
Xto  weak to defend the rampart against the host of assailants.      T
O9nTHE STANDARD SPEAKER
must call to my assistance their good sense, their patriotism  and their
virtue.  Do not, Gentlemen, suffer the rage of passion to drive reason
from her seat! If this law be indeed bad, let us join to remedy the
defects. Has it been passed in a manner which wounded your pridae
or roured your resentment?  Have, I conjure you, the maygnanimity
to pardon that offence! I entreat, I implore you, to sacrifice those
angry.passions to the interests of our country.  Pour out this pride
of opinion on the altar of patriotism,, Let it be an expiating libation for the weal of America.  Do not, for God's sake, do not suffer
that pride to plunge us all into the abyss of ruin!
Indeed, indeed, it will be but of little, very little, avail, wvhether
one opinion or the other be right or wrong; it will heal no wounds, it
will pay no debts, it will rebuild no ravaged towns.  Do not rely on
that popular will which has brought us frail beings into political existence.  That opinion is but a changeable thing.  It will soon change.
This very measure will change it. You will be deceived. Do not, I
beseech you, in a reliance on a foundation so frail, commit the dignlity,
the harmony, the existence of our Nation, to the wild wind! Trust
not your treasure to the waves. Throw not your compass and your
charts into the ocean. Do not believe that its billows will waft you
into port. Indeed, indeed, you will be deceived! Cast not away this
only anchor of our safety.  I have seen its progress.  I know the
difficulties through which it was obtained: I stand in the presence of
Almighty God, and of the world; and I declare to you, that, if you
lose this charter, never, - no, never will you get another! We are
now, perhaps, arrived at the parting point. I-lere, even here, we
stand on the brink of fate. Pause -pause! -for Heaven's sake,

147. FREE NAVIGATION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, 1803.- Gouverneur M11orris.
SiR, I wish for peace; I wish the negotiation may succeed; and,
therefore, I strongly urge you to adopt these resolutions. But, though
you should adopt them, they alone will not insure success.  I have no
hesitation in saying that you ought to have taken possession of New
Orleans and the Floridas, the instanlt your treaty was violated. You
ought to do it now. Your rights are invaded: confidence in negotiation is vain; there is, therefore, no alternative but force. You are
exposed to imminent present danger: you have the prospect of great
future advantage: you are justified by the clearest principles of right:
you are urged by the strongest motives of policy: you are commanded
by every sentiment of nationaldignity.  Look at the conduct of America in her infant years. When there was no actual invasion of right,
but only a claim to invade, she resisted the claim, she spurned the
insult. Did we then hesitate? Did we tlien wait for foreign alliance'?
No,- animated with the spirit, warmed with the soul of freedom, we
threw our oaths of allegiance in the face of our sovereign, and committed oLr fortunes and our fate to the God of battJeo. We then were

ibjects.   We had not then attained to the dignity of an independent
Republic.   We then had no rank among the Nations of the earth,
But we had the spirit which deserved that elevated station.  And, now
that we have gained it, shall we fall from our honor?
Sir, I repeat to you, that I wish for peace, -  real, lasting, honorablo
peace.  To obtain and secure this blessing, le-t us, by a bold and decie
sive conduct, convince the Powers of Europe that we are determined
to defend our rights,-  that we will not submit to insult, that we will
not bear degradation.  This is the conduct which becomes a generous
People.  This conduct will command the respect of the world.   Nay,
Sir, it may rouse all Europe to a proper sense of their situation.
1-48. AGAINST FOREIGN CONQUEST. -De Writt Clinton. Born, 1769; died, 1828.
In 1802, De Witt Clinton was elected to the Setlate of the United States from New York. In
the month of Februhary, 1803, a debate arose in that body on certain resolutions authorizing the
President to take immediate possession of New Orleans, and emipowering him to call out thirty
thousand militia to etfect that object. The followinsg is an extract from Clinton's speech on the
occasion.
IF I were called upon to prescribe a course of policy most important
for this country to pursue, it would be to avoid European connections
and wars. The time must arrive when we will have to contend withb.
some of the great powers of Europe; but let that period be put off as
long as possible.  It is our interest and our duty to cultivate peace,
with sincerity and good faith. As a young Nation, pursuing industry
in every channel, and adventuring commerce in every sea, it is highly
important that we should not only have a pacific character, but that
we should really deserve it.  If we mallifest ani unwarrantable ambition, and a rage for conquest, we unite all the great powers of Europe
against us. The security of all the European possessions in our vicinity will eternally depend, not upon their strength, but upon our moderation and justice.  Look at the Canadas; at the S}anish territories
to the South; at the British, Spanish, French, Danish and Dutch
West India Islands; at the vast countries to the West, as far as where
the Pacific rolls its waves.  Consider well the eventful consequences
that would result, if we were possessedcl by a spirit of conquest.  Consider well the impression which a manifestation of that spirit will snalcke
upon those who would be affected by it.
If we are to rush at once into the territory of a neighboring Nation,
with fire and sword, for the misconduct of a subordinate officer, will
tnot our national character be greatly injured?  Will we not be classed
with the robbers and destroyers of mankind? Will not the Nations
of Europe perceive in this conduct the germ of a lofty spirit, and an
enterprising ambition, which will level them to the earth, when age
has niaturedl our strength, and expanded our powers of annoyance,
unless they combine to cripple us in our infancy?  May not the. consequences be, that we must look out for a naval force to protect our,ommerce? that a close alliance will result? that we will be thrown
at on,e into the ocean of European politics, where every wave that
rolls, and every wind that blows, will agitate our bark!  Is this a
301THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
desirable state of things?  Will the People of this country be seduced
into it byall the colorings of rhetoric, and al; the arts of sophistry; by
elclement appeals to their pride, and artful addresses to their cupidity?
No, Sir! Three-fourths of the American People - I assert it boldly,
itld wiithout fear of contradiction - are opposed to this measure T And
would you   take up arms with a mill-stone hanging round your
lneck?  ilow would you bear up, not only against the force of the
enemy, but against the irresistible current of public opinion?  The
thing, Sir, is impossible; the measure is worse than madness  it is
wicked beyond the powers of description!
149. AMIERICAN INNOVATIONS.- James Madison. Born 1751; died, 1836,James Madison, who served two terms as President of the United States, was a Virginian by,irth. As a writer and a statesman, he stands among the first of his tines.
WiHY is the experiment of an extended Republic to be rejected,
merely because it may comprise what is new? Is it not the glory of the
Peoplle of America, that whilst they have paid a decent regard to the
opinions of former times and other Nations, they have not suffered a
blind veneration for antiquity, for custom, or for names, to overrule the
suggeestions of their own good sense, the knowledge of their own situa
tion, and the lesson of their own experience?  To this manly spirit,
posterity will be indbted for thie possession, and the world for the
example, of the numerous innovations displayed on the American theatre, in favor of private rights and public happiness. Hlad no important step been taken by the leaders of the Revolution, for which. a
precedent could not be discovered, - no Government established, of
which an exact model did not present itself, - the People of the United
States might, at this moment, have been numbered among the melancholy victims of misguided councils; must, at best, have been laboring
under the weight of some of those forms which have crushed the liberties of the rest of mankind. Happily for America,- happily, we trust,
for the whole human race,- they pursued a new and more noble
course.  They accomplished a Ievolution which has no parallel in the
annals of human society. They reared the fabric of Governaments
which have no model on the face of the globe. They formed the design
of a great confederacy, which it is incumbent on their successors to
improve and perpetuate.  If their works betray imperfections, we
wonder at the fewness of them.  If they erred most in the structure
of the Union, this was the most difficult to be executed; this is the
work which has been new-modelled by the act of your Conventical, and
it is that act on which you are now to deliberate and to decide.
150. INTEMPERANCE OF PARTY, 1815.-- Wm. Gaston. Born, 1778; died, 1841.
INTUEMPERANCE of party, wherever found, never will meet with an
advocate in me.  It is a most calamitous scourge to our country; the
bane of social enjoyment, of individual justice, and of public virtue;
unfriendly to the best pursuits of man, his interest and his duty. Seek
to uphold your measures by the force of argument, not cf demnncia30SSENATORIAL. -~- QUINCY.

These prove nothing but your anger or your weakness; and they are
sure to generate a spirit of moral resistance, not easily to be checked or
tamed.  Give to Presidential views Constitutional respect; but suffer
them not to supersede the exercise of independent inquiry.  Encourage instead of suppressing fair discussion, so that those who approve
not may at least have a respectful hearing. Thus, without derogating
a particle from the energy of your measures, you will impart a tone
to political dissensions which will deprive them of their acrimony, and
render them harmless to the Nation.
The nominal party distinctions, Sir, have become mere cabalistic
terms.  It is no longer a question whether, according to the theory of
our Constitution, there is more danger of the Federal encroaching on
the State Governments, or the Democracy of the State Governnmenits
paralyzing the arm of Federal power.  Federalism and Democracy
have lost their meaning.  It is now a question of commerce, peace
and Union of the States.  On this question, unless the honesty and
intelligence of the Nation shall confederate into one great American
party, disdaining petty office-keeping and office-hunting views, defying
alike the insolence of party prints, the prejudices of faction, and the
dominion of Executive influence, I fear a decision will be pronounced
fatal to the hopes, fatal to the existence, of the Nation.
151. AGAINST THE EMBARGO, 1808. -Josiah Quincy
I ASK, in what page of the Constitution you find the power of laying an embargo.  Directly given, it is nowhere.  Never before did
society witness a total prohibition of all intercourse like this, in a commercial Nation.  But it has been asked in debate, " Will not Massachusetts, the cradle of liberty, submit to such privations?"  An
embargo liberty was never cradled in Massachusetts. Our liberty was
not so much a mountain nymph as a sea nymph.  She was free as air.
She could swim, or she could run. The ocean was her cradle. Our
fathers met her as she came, like the goddess of beauty, from the
waves.   They caught her as she was sporting on the beach. They
courted her while she was spreading her nets upon the rocks. But an
embargo liberty, a hand-cuffed liberty, liberty in fetters, a liberty
traversing between the four sides of a prison and beating her head
against the walls, is none of our offspring.  We abjure the monster!
Its parentage is all inland.
Is embargo independence? Deceive not yourselves! It is palpable
submnission!  Gentlemen exclaim, "Great Britain smites us on one
clceek!" And what does Administration? "It turns the other, also.'
Gentlemen say, "Great Britain is a robber; she takes our cloak." And
what says Administration? "Let her take our coat, also." France and
Great Britain require you to relinquish a part of your commerce, and
you'yield it entirely!  At every corner of this great city we meet
some gentlemen of the majority wringing their hands, and exclaiming,
Z-1te                 winig          hns,~        i~.
303THE ST..NDARD SPEAKER.
What shall we do? Nothing but an embargo will save us. Remove it,
and what shall we do? "  Sir, it is not for me, an humble and uninflu
ential individual, at an awful distance from the predominant influences,
to suggest plans of Government. But, to my eye, the path of our duty
is as distinct as the Milky Way, - all studded with living sapphires,
glowing with cunmulating light.  It is the path of active preparation;
of dignified energy  It is the path of 1776! It consists not in
abandoning our rights, but in supporting them, as they exist, and
whrere tlhey exist, -on the ocean as well as on the land.  But I shall
he told, " This may lead to war."  I ask, " Are we now at peace?'
Certairnly not, unless retiring from insult be peace; unless shrinking
unclder the lash be peace! The surest way to prevent war is not to fear
it.  The idea that nothing on earth is so dreadful as war is inculcated
too studiously among us. Disgrace is worse! Abandonment of essential rights is worse!
152. PRIEDICTIONS OF DISUNION, 1820. - Win. Pinlkney. Born, 1765; died, 1822.
SIR, the People of the'United States, if I do not wholly mistake
their character, are wise as well as virtuous.  They know the value
of that Federal association which is to them  the single pledge and
guarantee of power and peace. Their warm and pious affections will
cling to it, as to their only hope of prosperity and happiness, in defiance of pernicious abstractions, by whomsoever inculcated, or howsoever seductive and ailluring in their aspect.  Sir, it is not an occasion
like this, - although connected, as, contrary to all reasonable expect.
ation, it has been, with fearful and disorganizing theories, which
would make our estimates, whether fanciful or sound, of natural law
tile measure of civil rights and political sovereignty in the social state,
-it is not, I say, an occasion like this, that can harm the Union. It
must, indeed, be a mighty storm that can push from its moorings thiu
sacred ark of the common sa:fety. It is not every trifling breeze, how.
ever it may be made to sob and howl in imitation of the tempest, by
the auxiliary breath of the ambitious, the timid, or the discontented,
that can drive this gallant vessel, freighted with everything that is
dtear to an American bosom, upon the rocks, or lay it a sheer hulk
upon the ocean.
I may, perhaps, mistake the flattering suggestions of hope (the greatest of all flatterers, as we are told) for the conclusions of sober reason.
Yet it is a pleasing error, if it be an error, and no man shall take it
from me.   I will continue to cherish the belief, - ay, Sir, in defiance
of the public patronage given to deadly speculations, which, invoking
the namne of Deity to aid their faculties for mischief, strike at all
establishments,- I will continue to cherish the belief that the Union
of these States is formed to bear up against far greater shocks than,
through all vicissitudes, it is ever likely to encounter. I will continue
to cherish the belief that, although, like all other human institutions
it may for a season be disturbed, or suffer momlentary eclipse by the

transit across its disk of some malignant planet, it possesses a recuper
ative force, a redeeming energy, in the hearts of the People, that will
soon restore it to its wonted calm, and give it back its accustomed
splendor. On such a subject I will discard all hysterical apprehensions; I will deal in no sinister auguries; I will indulge in no hypo.
chondriacal forebodings.  I will look forward to the future with ga~
and cheerful hope, and will make the prospect smile, in fancy at least
until overwhelming reality shall render it no longer possible.
153. BRITISH INFLUENCE, 1811.--John Randolph. Born, 1773; died, 1833.
John Randolph, an eccentric Statesman, but a man of marked talents, was a Virginian by
birth, and a descendant, in the seventh generation, from the celebrated Pocahontas, the daughter of Powhatan, a great Indian chief.
IMPUTATIONS of British influence have been uttered against the
opponents of this war.  Against whom are these charges brought?
Against men who, in the war of the Revolution, were in the Councils of
the Nation, or fighting the battles of your country! And by whom are
these charges made? By runaways, chiefly from the British dominions,
since the breaking out of the French troubles. The great autocrat of
all the Russias receives the homage of our high consideration.  The
Dey of Algiers and his divan of Pirates are very civil, good sort of people, with whom we find ngdifficulty in maintaining the relations of peace
and amity.   "Turks, Jews and Infidels," - Melimelli or the Little
Turtle, - barbarians and savages of every clime and color, are welcome
to our arms.  With chiefs of banditti, negro or mulatto, we can treat
and can trade.  Name, however, but England, and all our antipathies
are up in arms against her. Against whom? Against those whose
blood runs in our veins; in commrion with whom we claim Shakspeare,
and Newton, and Chatham, for our countrymen; whose form of government is the freest on earth, our own only excepted; from whom every
valuable principle of our own institutions has been borrowed, - repre.
sentation, jury trial, voting the supplies, writ of habeas corpus, our
whole civil and criminal jurisprudence;-- against our fellow-Protestants, identifiecl in blood, in language, in religion, with ourselves.
In what school clid the worthies of our land--the Washingtons.
Ilenrys, Hancocks, Franklins, Rutledges, of America -learn those prin.
ciples of civil liberty which were so nobly asserted by their wisdom and
valor?  American resistance to British usurpation has not been more
warmly cherished by these great men and their compatriots, - not more
by Washington, Hancock and Henry, - than by Chatham, and his illustrious associates in the British Parliament. It ought to be remembered,
too. that the heart of the English people was with us.  It was a selfish
and corrupt Ministry, and their servile tools, to whom we were not
more opposed than they were. I trust that none such may ever exist
among us; for tools will never be wanting to subserve the purposes,
however ruinous or wicked, of kings and ministers of state. I acknowledge the influence of a Shakspeare and a Milton apon my im.

which I can never shake off.
154. ON THE GREEK QUESTION, 1824.--Id.
PERHAPS one of the prettiest themes for declamation ever presented
to a deliberative assembly is this proposition in behalf of Greece.  But,
Sir, I look at the measure as one fraught with deep and deadly danger
to the best interests of the American People. Liberty and religion
are objects as dear to my heart as to that of any gentleman in this or
any other assembly. But, in the name of these holy words, by this
powerful spell, is this Nation to be conjured and persuaded out of the.
highway of I-eaven, - out of its present comparatively happy state,
into all the disastrous conflicts arising from the policy of European
powers, with all the consequences which flow from them?
Sir, I am afraid that along with some most excellent attributes and
qualities, -the love of liberty, jury trial, the writ of habeas corpus,
and all the blessings of free government, that we have derived fromn our
Anglo-Saxon ancestors, - we have got not a little of their John Bull,
or, rather, bull-dog spirit - their readiness t'fight for anybody, and on
any occasion.  Sir, England has been for centuries the game-cock of
Europe. It is impossible to specify the wars in which she has been
engaged for contrary purposes; - and she will, with great pleasure, see
us take off her shoulders the labor of preserving the balance of power.
We find her fighting now for the Queen of Hungary, -  then, for her
inveterate foe, the King of Prussia; now at war for the restoration
of the Bourbons, - and now on the eve of war with them, for the
liberties of Spain. These lines on the subject were never more appli.
cable than they have now become:
" Now Europe's balanced - neither side prevails;:For nothing's left in either of the scales."
If we pursue the same policy, we must travel the samne road and
endure the same burdens under which England now groans.   But,
glorious as such a design might be, a President of the United States
would, in my apprehension, occupy a prouder place in history, who, when
he retires from office, can say to the People who elected him, I leave you
without a debt than if he had fought as- many pitched, battles as Ca sar,
or achievcd as many naval victories as Nelson. And what, Sir, is debt?
In an individual, it is slavery. It is slavery of the worst sort, surpassing that of the West India Islands,- for it enslaves the mind as well
as it enslaves the body; and the creature who can be abject enough to
incur and to submit to it receives in that condition of his being an
adequate punishment.  Of course, I speak of debt, with the es.ception
of unavoidable misfortune. I speak of debt caused by mismanagement,
by unwarrantable generosity, by being generous before being jlst. I
306SENATORIAL. - JOHN RANDOLPH.
Know that this sentiment wvas ridiculed by Sheridan, whose lamenltable
end was the best commentary upon its truth.  No, Sir: let us abandon
these projects. Let us say to these seven millions of Greeks, "We
defended ourselves, when we were but three millions, against a power,
in comparison to which the Turk is but as a lamb.  Go, and do thou
likewise."
1!. ON ALTERING THE VIRGINIA CONSTITUTION, 1829.--John Randolph.
SIR, I see no wisdom in making this provision for future changes.'You niust give Governments time to operate on the People, and give
the People time to become gradlually assimilated to their institutions.
Almost anything is better than this state of perpetual uncertainty. A
People may have the best form of Government that the wit of main
ever devised, and yet, from its uncertainty alone, may, in effect, live
under the worst Government in the world.  Sir, how often must I
repeat, that change is not reform?  I am willing that this new Constitution shall stand as long as it is possible for it to stand; and that,
believe me, is a very short time. Sir, it is vain to deny it.  They
may say what they please about the old Constitution, - the defect is
not there. It is not in the form of the old edifice, - neither in the
design nor the elevation; it is in the material, - it is in the People
of Virginia. To my knowledge, that People are changed from what
they have been. The four hundred men who went out to David were
in debt. The partisans of C(esar were in debt. The fellow-laborers
of Catiline were in debt. And I defy you to show me a desperately
indebted People, anywhere, who can bear a regular, sober Government.
I throw the challenge to all who hear me. I say that the character
of the good old Virginia planter - the man who owned from five to
twenty slaves, or less, who lived by hard work, and who paid his
debts - is passed'away. A new order of things is come. The period
has arrived of living by one's wits; of living by contracting debts
that one cannot pay; and, above all, of living by office-hunting.
Sir, what do we see?  Bankrupts - branded bankrupts - giving
great dinners, sending their children to the most expensive schools,
giving grand parties, and just as well received as anybody in society.!
I say that, in such a state of things,' the old Constitution was too
good for them, - they could not bear it. No, Sir; they could not
bear a freehold suffrage, and a property representation.  I have always
endeavored to do the People justice; but I will not flatter theLi, - I
will not pander to their appetite for change. I will do nothing to
provide for change. I will not agree to any rule of future apportionment, or to any provision for future changes, called amendments to the
Constitution. Those who love change -who delight in public confusion - who wish to feed the cauldron, and make it bubble - may
vote, if they please, for future changes.  But by what spell, by
what formula, are you going to bind the People tio all future time?
The days of Lycurgus are gone by, when'we could swear the People

do it by degrees, and constant practice. I would therea2re recommend it to
him that he should daily exercise himself in rea.ding or repeating, in the hearing
of a friend; and that, too, in a large room. At first, his friend( should stand
at such a distance only as the speaker can easily reach, in his usu ai manner of
delivering himself. Afterwards, let him gradually increwe his distance, and
the speaker will in the same gradual proportion increase the force of his
voice."  In doing this, the speaker still keeps on the same tone of voice,
but gives it with greater power. It is material to notice, that a well-forme l
middle tone, and even a low one, is capable of filling any room; and that tkL
neglect of strengtheniing the voice in these leads a speaker to adopt the higl,
3houting note which is often heard in our pulpits. Hamlet's address to the
play:ers should be mostly delivered in this middle key.
IIIG-II KEY.
This key of the voice, thlough'very uncommon in level speaking or reading, ought to be practised, as it tends to give strength to the voice generally,
and as it is frequently employed in public speaking aind declamation. Every one
can speak in a high key, but few do it pleasingly. There is a compression
necessary in the high notes, as well as the middle and low; this compression
distinguishes the vociferous passion of the peasant firom that of the accomnplisbed
actor or orator. The following passage will bear the most vigorous exercise of
the high key:
Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold Yeomen!
Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head;
Spur your proucd horses hard, and ride in blood:
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves! -
A thkusand hearts are great within my bosom;
Advance our standards, set upon our foes;
Our ancient word of courage, fair St. George,
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons  
Upon them! Victory sits on our helms!
ft should be borne in mind, that it is not he who spe-aks the loudest who
can be heard the furthest.  "It is a curious fact in the history of sound,"
says a scientific observer, " that the loudest noises always perish on the spot
where they are produced, whereas musical notes will be heard at a great
distance. Thus, if we approach within a mile or two of a town or village in
which a fair is held, we nmay hear very faintly the clamor of the multitude,
but more distinctly the organs, and other musical instruments, which are played
for their amlusement. If a Cremona violin, a real Amati, be played by the
side of a modern fiddle, the latter will sound much louder than the former;
but the sweet, brilliant tone of the Amati will be heard at a distance the other
cannot reach. Dr. Young, on the authority of Durham, states that at G,braltar the husman voice may be heard at a greater distance than that oi any
Ather animal; thus, when the cottager in the woods, or the open plain, w.shes
to call her husband, who is working at a distance, she does not shout, but
pitches her voice to a musical key, which she knows from habit, and by that
means reaches his ear. The loudest roar of the largest lion could not
penetrate so far. Loud speakers are seldom heard to advantage. Burke's
voice is said to have been a sort of lofty cry, which tended as muuch as the
formality of his discourse in the House of Commons to send the members to
their dinner. Chatham's lowest whisper was distinctly heard.' His middle
tones were sweet, rich and beautifully varied,' says a writer, describing the
orator;' when he raised his voice to the highest pitch, the House was completely filled with the volume of souhd; and the effect was awful, except
when he wished to cheer or animate - and then he had spirit-stirring notes
whlich were perfectly irresistible.  The terrible, however, was his peculiar
pow 3er. Then the House sank before him; still, he was dignified. and, wonderTHE STANDARD SPEAKER.
not to alter the Constitution until he should return.  Yo'a may make
what entries on parchment you please;  give me a Constitution that
will last for half a century; that is all I wish for. No Constitution
that you can make will last the one-half of half a century. Sir, I will
stake anything, short of my salvation, that those who are maleconte il
now will be more malecontent, three years hence, than they ate at this
day. I have no favor for this Constitution.  I shall vote against its
aloption, and I shall advise all the people of my district to set thlei
faces - ay, and their shoulders, too - against it.
156. IN FAVOR OF A STATE LAW AGAINST DUELLING. - Compilation.
THE bill which has been read, Mr. Speaker, claims the serious attehi
tion of this House.  It is one in which every citizen is deeply interested. Do not, I implore you, confound the sacred name of honor
with the practice of duelling,- with that ferocious prejudice which
attaches all the virtues to the point of the sword, and is only fitted to
make bad men bold. In what does this prejudice consist? In an
opinion the most extravagant and barbarous that ever took possession
of the human mind! - in the opinion that all the social duties are
supplied by courage; that a man is no more a cheat, no more a
rascal, no more a calumniator, if he can only fight;, and that steel and
gunpowder are the true diagnostics of innocence and worth. And so
the law of force is made the law of right; murder, the criterion of
honor! To grant or receive reparation, one must kill or be killed!
All offences may be wiped out by blood! If wolves could reason,
would they be governed by maxims more atrocious than these?
But we are told that public opinion - the opinion of the community
in which we live - upholds the custom. And, Sir, if it were so, is
there not more courage in resisting than in following a false public
opinion? The man with a proper self-respect is little sensitive to tho
unmerited contempt of others.  The smile of his own conscience irn
more prized by him than all that the world can give or take away.
Is there any guilt to be compared with that of a voluntary homicide "
Could the dismal recollection of blood so shed cease ever to cry for ven.
geance at the bottom of the heart? The man who, with real or affected
gayety and coolness, goes to a mortal encounter with a fellow-being, is,
in my eyes, an object of more horror than the brute beast who strivae
to tear in pieces one of his kind.  True courage is constant, innmuta
ble self-poised.  It does not impel us, at one moment, to brave murder
and death; and, the next, to shrink pusillanimously from an injurious
public opinion. It accompanies the good man everywhere, - to thi
field of danger, in his country's cause; to t.he social circle, to lift his
voice in behalf of truth or of the absent; to.the pillow of disease, tG
fortify him against the trials of sickness, and the approach of death.
Sir, if public opinion is unsound on this subject, let us not be.participants in the guilt of upholding a barbarous custom. Let us affix to
it the krand of legislative rebuke and disqualification.  Pass this bill

shield between the man who refuses a challenge and the public opinion
that would disgrace him.   Pass this bill, and you raise a barrier in the
road to honor and preferment, at which the ambitious nman will pautse
and reflect, before engaging in a duel.     As fathers, as brothers, as
men, and as legislators, I call on this House to suppress an evil which
strikes at you in all these relations.  I call on you to raise your hands
ainst a crime, the disgrace of our land, and the scourge of our peace
157 THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.--J. Q. ctaams.
John Quincy Adams, the sixth President of the United States, and son of John Adamns the
second President, was born at Quincy, Massachusettl;s, July 11th, 1767. After stuclying lao he
entered political life, was appointed minister to the Netherlands by Waslhington, and filled many
high ofdces, till he reached the highest, in 1825. IIe died in the Capitol, at Washirngton, while
a member of the House of Representatives, 1848. HIls last words, as he fell in a fit, from which
he did not recover, were,'"This is the last of earth!"
THE Declaration of Independence!       The interest which, in that
paper, has survived the occasion upon which it was issued, -  the interest
which is of every age and every clime, -   the interest which quickens
with the lapse of years, spreads as it grows old, and brightens as it.recedes, -  is in the principles which it proclaims.  It was the first solemn
declaration by a Nation of the only legitimnate foundation of civil Government.   It was the corner-stone of a new fabric, destined to cover
the surface of the globe. It demolished, at a stroke, the lawfulness of
all Governments founded upon conquest.      It swept away all the rubbish of accumulated centuries of servitude.   It announced, in practical
form, to the world, the transcendent truth of the inalienable sovereignty
of the People.   It proved that the social compact was no figment of
the imagination, but a real, solid, and sacred bond of the social union.
From  the day of this declaration, the People of North Almerica were
no longer the fragment of a distant empire, imploring justice and
mercy from an inexorable master, in another hemisphere.      They were
no longer children, appealing in vain to the sympathies of a heartless
mother; no longer subjects, leaning upon the shattered columns of
royal promises, and invoking the faith of parchment to secure their
rights.  They were a Nation, asserting as of 1right, and maintaining by
war, its own existence.  A Nation was born in a day.
"How many ages hence
Shall this, their lofty scene, be acted o'er,
In States unborn, and accents yet unknown."
It will be acted o'er, fellow-citizens, but it can never be repeated. It
stands, and must forever stand, alone; a beacon on the sunimit of the
nountain, to which all the inhabitants of the earth may turn their
eyes, for a genial and saving  light, till time. shall be lost in eternity,
and this globe itself dissolve, nor leave a wreck behind.  It stands forever, a light of admonition to the rulers of men, a light of salvation
and redemption    to  the oppressed.   So long as this planet shall be
inhabited by human beings, so long      as man    shlll be of a social
nature, so long as Government shall be necessary to the great moral

purposes of society, so long as it shall be abused to the purposes of
oppression, - so long shall this declaration hold out, to the sovereign
and to the subject, the extent and the boundaries of their respective
rights and duties, founded in the laws of Nature and of Nature's God.
1T8 WASIIINGTON'S SWORD AND FRANKLIN'S STAFF. -J. Q. Adamsg in.Ie U S
House of Representatives, on reception of these memorials by Congress.
THE sword of Washington! The staff of Franklin! O, Sir, what
2sseciations are linked in adamant with these names! Washington,
whose sword was never drawn but in the cause of his country, and
never sheathed when wielded in his country's cause! Franklin, the
philosopher of the thunderbolt, the printing-press, and the ploughshare! - What names are these in the scanty catalogue of the benefactors of human kind! Washington and Franklin! What other two
men, whose lives belong to the eighteenth century of Christendom,
have left a deeper impression of themselves upon the age in which they
lived, and upon all after time?
Washington, the warrior and the legislator! In war, contending,
by the wager of battle, for the independence of his country, and for
the freedom of the human race, - ever manifesting, amidst its horrors,,by precept and by example, his reverence for the laws of peace, and
for the tenderest sympathies of humanity; in peace, soothing the
ferocious spirit of discord, among his own countrymen, into harmony
and union, and giving to that very sword, now presented to his country, a charm more potent than that attributed, in ancient times, to the
lyre of Orpheus.
Franklin! - The mechanic of his own fortune; teaching, in early
youth, under the shackles of indigence, the way to wealth, and, in the
shade of obscurity, the path to greatness; in the maturity of manhood, disarming the thunder of its terrors, the lightning of its fatal
blast; and wresting from the tyrant's hand the still more afflictive
sceptre of oppression: while descending into the vale of years, travers.
ing the Atlantic Ocean, braving, in the dead of winter, the battle and
the breeze, bearing in his hand the charter of Independence, which he
had contributed to form, and tendering, from the self-created Nation
to the mightiest monarchs of Europe, the olive-branch of peace, the
mercurial wand of commerce, and the amulet of protection and safety
to the man of peace, on the pathless ocean, from the inexorable cruelty
and merciless rapacity of war.
And, finally, in the last stage of life, with fourscore winters upon
his head, under the torture of an incurable disease, returning to his
native land, closing his days as the chief magistrate of his adopted
commonwealth, after contributing by his counsels, under the Presidency of Washington, and recording his name, under the sanction of
devout prayer, invoked by him to God, to that Constitution under the
authority of which we are here assembled, as the Representatives of

these venerable relics of the wise, the valiant, and the good founders
of our great confederated Republic, - these sacred symbols of our
golden age. May they be deposited among the archives of our Govern.ment! And may every American, who shall hereafter behold
them, ejaculate a mingled offering of praise to that Supreme Ruler of
the Untiverse, by whose tender mercies our Union has been hithecrto
preserved, through all the vicissitudes and revolutions of this turbulent
world; and of prayer for the continuance of these blessings, by the
dispensations of Providence, to our beloved country, from age to age,

159. UNION LINKED WITH LIBERTY, 1833.--Andrew Jackson. B. 1767; d. 1848.
WITHOUT Union, our independence and liberty would never have'been achieved; without Union, they can never be maintained. Divided
into twenty-four, or even a smaller number of separate communities,
we shall see our internal trade burdened with numberless restraints
and exactions; communication between distant points and sections
obstructed, or cut off; our sons made soldiers, to deluge with blood the
fields they now till in peace; the mass of our People borne down and
impoverished by taxes to support armies and navies; and military
leaders, at the head of their victorious legions, becoming our lawgivers
and judges. The loss of liberty, of all good Governmnent, of peace,
plenty and happiness, must inevitably follow a dissolution of the
Union. In supporting it, therefore, we support all that is dear to the
freeman and the philanthropist.
The time at which I stand before you is full of interest. The eyes
of all Nations are fixed on our Republic. The event of the existing
crisis will be decisive, in the opinion of mankind, of the practicability of
our Federal system of Government.  Great is the stake placed in our
hands; great is the responsibility which must rest upon the People of
the United States. Let us realize the importance of the attitude in
which we stand before the world. Let us exercise forbearance and
firmness. Let us extricate our country fiom the dangers which surround it, and learn wisdom from the lessons they inculcate. Deeply
impressed with the truth of these observations, and under the obligation of that solemn oath which I am about to take, I shall. continue to
exert all my faculties to maintain the just powers of the Constitution,
and to transmit unimpaired to posterity the blessings of our Federal
Union.
At the same time, it will be my aim to inculcate, by my official act,
the necessity of exercising, by the General Government, those powers
only that are clearly delegated; to encourage simplicity and economy
in the expenditures of the Government; to raise no more money from
the People than may be requisite for these objects, and in a manner
that will best promote the interests of all classes of the community,
and of all portions of the Union.  Constantly bearing in mind that, in
entering into society, individuals must give up a share of liberty ev

prese:ve the rest." it will be my desire so to discharge my duties as to
foster with our brethren, in all parts of the country, a spirit of liberal
concessi(n and compromise; and, by reconciling our fellow-citizens to
those partial sacrifices which they must unavoidably make, for the
preservation of a greater good, to recommend our invaluable Government and Union to the confidence and affections of the American Pco,
ple.  Finally, it is my most fervent prayer to that Almighty Being
before whom I now stand, and who has kept us in his hands from the
infancy of our Republic to the present day, that he will so overrule all
my intentions and actions, and inspire the hearts of my fellow-citizens,
that we may be preserved from dangers of all kinds, and continue forever a UNITED AND HAPPY PEOPLE.
160. RESPONSIBILITIES OF A RECOMMENDATION OF WAR. - Horace Binney.
WHAT are sufficient causes of war, let no man say, let no legislator
say, until the question of war is directly and inevitably before him.
Jurists may be permitted, with comparative safety, to pile tome upon
tome of interminable disquisition upon the motives, reasons and causes,
of just and unjust war; metaphysicians may be suffered with impunity to spin the thread of their speculations until it is attenuated to a
cobweb; but, for a body created for the government of a great nation,
and for the adjustment and protection of its infinitely diversified interests, it is worse than folly to speculate upon the causes of war, until
the great question shall be presented for inmmediate action,--until
they shall hold the united question of cause, motive, and present expediency, in the very palm of their hands.  War is a tremendous evil
Come when it will, unless it shall come in the necessary defence of
our national security, or of that honor under whose protection national
security reposes, it will come too soon; - too soon for our national
prosperity; too soon for our individual happiness; too soon for
the frugal, industrious, and virtuous habits of our citizens; too soon,
perhaps, fbr our most precious institutions.  The man who, for ally
cause, save the s.c:red cause of public security, which makes all wars
defensive, - the:lman who, for any cause but this, shaell promote or
compel this final and terrible resort, assumes a responsibility second to
none, - nay, transcendently deeper and higher than any, - which man
can assume before his fellow-men, or in the presence of God, his
-Creator.
161. TIIHE SUPREME COURT. OF THE UNITED STATES. --orace Bint:;et.'WHAT, Sir, is the Supreme Court of the United States?  It is
the august representative of the wisdom and justice and conscience of
this whole People, in the exposition of their Constitution and laws.
It is the peaceful and venerable arbitrator between the citizens in all
questions touching the extent and sway of constitutional power. It is
the g'eat moral substitute for force in controversies between the
People, the States and the Union.  It is that department of Adminis
~812SENATORIAL -- LEGARi:E.
tration whose calm voice dispenses the blessings of the Constitution.
in the overthrow of all improvident or unjust legislation by a State,
directed against the contracts, the currency, or the intercourse of the
People, and in the maintenance of the lawful authority and institutions of the Union, against inroads, by color of law, from all or any of
the States, or from Congress itself.  If the voice of this tribunal,
created by the People, be not authoritative to the People, what voice
can be? None, my fellow-citizens, absolutely none, but that voice
which speaks through the trumpet of the conqueror.
It has been truly said, by an eminent statesman, " that if that which
Congress has enacted, and the Suprem:ne Court has sanctioned, be not
the law, then the reign of the law has ceased, and the reign of individual opinion has begun."  It may be said, with equal truth, that if
that which Congress has enacted, and the Supremle Court has sanctioned, be not the law, then has this Government but one department,
and it is that which wields the physical force of the country. If the
Supreme Court of the Union, or its authority, be taken away, what
remains?  Force, and nothing but force, if the Union is to continue
at all. The world knows of no other powers of Government, than the
power of the law, sustained by public opinion, and the power of the
sword, sustained by the arm that wields it. I hold it, Sir, to be free
from all doubt, that wherever an attempt shall be made to destroy this
Union, if it is under the direction of ordinary understanding, it will
begin by prostrating the influence of Congress, and of the Supreme
Court of the United States.
162. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES NOT AN EXPERIMENT, 1837.Hugh S. Legard. Born in South Carolina, 1797; died, 1843.
WE are told that our Constitution - the Constitution of the United
States -is a mere experiment. Sir, I deny it utterly; and he that
says so shows me that he has either not studied at all, or studied to
very little purpose, the history and genius of our institutions. The
great cause of their prosperous results - a cause which every one of
the many attempts since vainly made to imitate them, on this continent or in Europe, only demonstrates the more clearly - is precisely
the contrary. It is because our fathers made no experiments, and had
no experiments to make, that their workl has stood. They were
forced, by a violation of their historical, hereditary rights under the
old common law of their race, to dissolve their connection with the
mother country.  But the whole constitution of society in the States,
the great body and bulk of their public law, with all its maxims and
principles, --in short, all that is republican in our institutions,remained, after the Revolution, and remains now, with some very
subordinate modifications, what it was from the beginning.
Our written constitutions do nothing but consecrate and fortify the
"plain rules of ancient liberty," handed down with Maglia Charta,
fiorm the earliest history of our race.  It is not a piece of paper, Sir
8313TIEF STANDARD SPEAKER.
it is no(t a few au3tractions engrossed on parchment, that make free
Jrovernrnents. No, Sir; the law of liberty must be inscribed on the
neart of the citizen: THE WORD, if I may use the expression without
irreverence, MUST BECOME FLESH. You must have a whole People
trained, disciplined bred, - yea, and born, - as our fathers were, to
institutions like ours. Before the Colonies existed, the Petition of
Rights, that Magna Charta of a more enlightened age, had been presented, in 1.628, by Lord Coke and his immortal coinpeers.  Our
fbunders brought it with them, and we have not gone one step beyond
them. They brought these maxims of civil liberty, not in their
libraries, but in their souls; not as philosophical prattle, not as
barren generalities, but as rules of conduct; as a symbol of public
duty and private right, to be adhered to with religious fidelity; and
the very first pilgrim that set his foot upon tle rock of Plymouth
stepped forth a LIVING CONSTITUTION, armed at all points to defend and
to perpetuate the liberty to which he had devoted his whole being.
163. EMOTIONS ON RETURNING TO THE UNITED STATES, 1837. --Legard.
SIR, I dare not trust myself to speak of my chuntry with the rapture which I habitually feel when I contemplate her marvellous history.
But this I will say, -that, on my return to it, after an absence of
only four years, I was filled with wonder at all I saw and all I heard.
What is to be cormpared with it? I found New York grown up to
almost double its former size, with the air of a great capital, instead of
a mere flourishing commercial town, as I had known it.  I listened to
accounts of voyages of a thousand miles in magnificent steamboats on the
waters of those great lakes, which, but the other day, I left sleeping
in the primeval silence of nature, in the recesses of a vast wilderness;
and I felt that there is a grandeur and a majesty in this irresistible
onward march of a race, created, as I believe, and elected, to possess
and people a Continent, which belong to few other objects, either of
the moral or material world.
We may become so much accustomed to such things that they shall
nake as little impression upon our minds as the glories of the Heavens
above us; but, looking on them, lately, as with the eye of the stranger,
I felt. what a recent English traveller is said to have remarked, that,
far from being without poetry, as some have vainly alleged, our whole
ou-antry is one great poem.  Sir, it is so; and if there be a man that
can ihink of what is doing, in all parts of this most blessed of all
lands t embellish and advance it, -who can contemplate that living
mass of intelligence, activity and improvement, as it rolls on, in its
sure and steady progress, to the uttermost extremities of the West,who can see scenes of savage desolation transformed, almost with the
suddenness of enchantment, into those of fruitfulness and beauty,
crowined with flourishing cities, filled with the noblest of all popula.
tions, - if there be a man, I say, that can witness all this, passing
iurder his very eyes, without feeling his heart beat high, av4 his
g14tm%aginttloio warmed and transported by it, be sure, Sir, that the
raptures of son.r exist not for him; he would listen in vain to Tasso or
Camoens, telling a tale of the wars of knights and crusaders, or of the
discovery and (onquest of another hemisphere.
164. IN FAVOR OF PROSECUTING THE WAR, 1813. --Henry Clay.
WHEN the administration was striving, by the operation of peacoful
measures, to bring Great Britain back to a sense of justice, the Gentlemen of the opposition were for old-fashioned war. And, now they
have got old-fashioned war, their sensibilities are cruelly shocked, and
all their sympathies lavished upon the harmless inhabitants of the
adjoining'Provinces. What does a state of war present? The united
energies of one People arrayed against the combined energies of
another; a conflict in which each party aims to inflict all the injury
it can, by sea and land, upon the territories, property, and citizens
of the other, - subject only to the rules of mitigated war, practised
by civilized Nations. The Gentlemen would not touch the continental
provinces of the enemy; nor, I presume, for the same reason, her possessions in the West Indies.  The same humane spirit would spare the
seamen and soldiers of the enemy. The sacred person of his Majesty
mlust not be attacked, for the learned Gentlemen on the other side
are quite familiar with the maxim that the King can do no wrong.
Indeed, Sir, I know of no person on whom we may make war, upon
the principles of the honorable Gentlemen, but Mr. Stephen, the
celebrated author of the orders in council, or the board of admiralty,
who authorize and regulate the practice of impressment!
The disasters of the war admonish us, we are told, of the necessity
of terminating the contest. If our achievements by land have been
less splendid than those of our intrepid seamen by water, it is not
because the American soldier is less brave.  On the one element,
organization, discipline, and a thorough knowledge of their duties,
exist, on the part of the officers and their men.  On the other, almost
everything is yet to be acquired. We have, however, the consolation
that our country abounds with the richest materials, and that in no
instance, when engaged in action, have our arms been tarnished.
An'honorable peace is attainable only by an efficient war. My
plan would be, to call out the ample resources of the country, give
them a judicious direction, prosecute the war with the utmost vigor,
3trike wherever we can reach the enemy, at sea or on land, and negotiate the terms of a peace at Quebec or at Halifax.  We are told that
England is a proud and lofty Nation, which, disdaining to wait for
danger, meets it half way. Haughty as she is, we once triumphed
over her; and, if' we do not listen to the councils of timidity and despair,
we shall again prevail.  In such a cause, with the aid of Providence,
we must come out crowned with success; but, if we fail, let us fail like
men,- lash ourselves to our gallant tars, and expire together in one
common struggle, fighting for FREE TIRADE AND SEAMEN'S RIGHTS!

165. DEFENCE OF JEFFERSON, 1813.--Henry Clay.
NEXT to the notice which the opposition has found itself called Upon
to bestow upon the French emperor, a distinguished citizen of Virginia,
formerly President of the United States, has never for a moment failed
to receive their kindest and most respectful attention.  An honorable
gentleman from Massachusetts, of whom I am sorry to say, it becomes
necessary for me, in. the course of my remarks, to take some notice,
has alluded to him in a remarkable manner.  Neither his retirement
from public office, his eminent services, nor his advanced age, can
exempt this patriot from the coarse assaults of party malevolence.
No, Sir! In 1801, he snatched from the rude hand of usurpation the
violated Constitution of his country, - and that is his crime. He preserved that instrument, in form, and substance, and spirit, a precious
inheritance for generations to come, - and for this he can never be forgiven. How vain and imrpotent is party rage, directed against such a
man! He is not more elevated by his lofty residence, upon the summit of his own favorite mountain, than he is lifted, by the serenity of
his mind and the consciousness of a well-spent life, above the malignant passions and bitter feelings of the day.  No! his own beloved
Monticello is not less moved by the storms that beat against its sides,
than is this illustrious man, by the howlings of the whole British pack,
let loose from the Essex kennel!  When the gentleman to whom 1
have been compelled to allude shall have mingled his dust with that of
his abused ancestors, - when he shall have been consigned to oblivion,
or, if he lives at all, shall live only in the treasonable annals of a certain junto, - the name of Jefferson will be hailed with gratitude, his
memory honored and cherished as the second founder of the liberties
of the People, and the period of his administration will be looked back
to as one of the happiest and brightest epochs of American history!
166. MILITARY INSUBORDINATION, 1819.--Henry Clay.
WE are fighting a great moral battle, for the benefit, not only of our
country, but of all mankind. The eyes of the whole world are in fixed
attention upon us.  One, and the largest portion of it, is gazing with
contempt, with jealousy, and with envy; the other portion, with hope,
with confidence, and with affection.  Everywhere the black cloud of
legitimacy is suspended over the world, save only one bright spot,
which breaks out from the political hemisphere of the West, to enlighten, and animate, and gladden, the human heart.  Obscure that
by the downfall of liberty here, and all mankind are enshroudecd in a
pall of universal darkness. To you, Mr. Chairman, belongs the high
privilege of transmitting, unimpaired, to posterity, the fair character
and liberty of our country. Do you expect to execute this high trusty
by trampling, or suffering to be trampled down, law, justice, the CoInstitution, and the rights of the People? by exhibiting examples of
inhumanity, and cruelty, and ambition?. When the minions oi desoot316SENATORIAL. -- CLAY.
Ism heard, in Europe, of the seizure of Pensacola, how did they
chuckle, and chide the admirers of our institutions, tauntingly pointing
to the demonstration of a spirit of injustice and aggrandizement made
by our country, in the midst of an amicable negotiation! Behold,
said they, the conduct of those who are constantly reproaching Kings'
You saw how those admirers were astounded and hung their heads.
You saw, too, when that illustrious man who presides over us adopted
his pacific, moderate, and just course, how they once more lifted up
their heads, with exultation and delight beaming in their countenances.
And you saw how those minions themselves were finally compelled to
unite in the general praises bestowed upon our Government. Beware
how you forfeit this exalted character! Beware how you give a fatal
sanction, in this infant period of our republic, scarcely yet two-score
years old, to military insubordination! Remember that Greece had
her Alexander, Rome her Caesar, England her Cromwell, France her
Bonaparte; and that, if we would escape the rock on which they split,
we must avoid -their errors.
I hope gentlemen will deliberately survey the awful isthmus on
which we stand. They may bear down all opposition; they may even
vote the General  the public thanks; they may carry him triumphantly through this House. But, if they do, in my humble judgment,
it will be a triumph of the principle of insubordination, a triumph of
the military over the civil authority, a triumph over the powers of this
House, a triumph over the Constitution of the land. And I pray most
devoutly to Heaven, that it may not prove, in its ultimate effects and
consequences, a triumph over the liberties of the People!
167. THE NOBLEST PUBLIC VIRTUE, 1841.--Henry Clay.
TIHERE is a sort of courage, which, I frankly confess it, I do nct
possess, -a boldness to which I dare not aspire, a valor which I cannot
covet. I cannot lay myself down in the way of the welfare and happiness of my country. That, I cannot, -I have not the courage to do.
I cannot interpose the power with which I may be invested- -a power
conferred, not for my personal benefit, nor for my aggrandizement, but
for my country's good- to check her onward march to greatness and
glorv. I have not courage enough. I am too cowardly for that.  I
would not, I dare not, in the exercise of such a threat, lie down, and
place my body across the path that leads my country to prosperity and
happiness. This is a sort of courage widely different from that which
a man may display in his private conduct and personal relations. Personal or private courage is totally distinct from that highler and nobler
courage which prompts the patriot to offer himself a voluntary sacrifice
to his country's good.
Apprehensions of the imputation of the want of firmness sometimes
impel us to potform rash and inconsiderate acts.  It is tLe greatest

fal as was his eloquence, it was attended lwith this important effect, that it
possessed every one with a conviction that there was something in him finer
than his words,-t tlat the man was greater, infinitely greater, than the
orator.' "
MONOTONE.
A monotone is intonation without change of pitch: that is, preserving a
fulness of tone, without ascent or descent on the scale. It is no very difficult
matter to be loud in a high tone; but to be loud and forcible in a low
tone, requires great practice and management; this, however, may be facilitated by pronouncing forcibly at first in a low monotone. A monotone, though
in a low key, and without force, is much more sonorous and audible than when
the voice slides up and down at almost every word, as it must do to be
various. This tone is adopted by actors when they repeat passages aside. It
conveys the idea of being inaudible to those with them in the scene, by being
in a lower tone than that used in the dialogue; and, by being in a monotone,
becomes audible to the whole house. The monotone, tlherefore, is aln excellent
vehicle fir such passages as require force and audibility in a low tone, and in
the hands of a judicious reader or speaker is a perpetual source of variety. It
is used when anythingr awful or sublime is to be expressed, as
0! when the last account twixt I-eaven and earth
Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
Witness against us to damnation.
The language of the ghost in Htamlet is mostly uttered in a deep monotone.
The following passage from Ion is partly given in a solemn monotone:
Dark and cold
Stretches the path, which, when I vear the Crown,
I nee(-s must enter; - the great Gods forbid
That thou shouldst follow it!
The monotone is varied, in th3 iti!,cized part, to the tone of passionate
emotion and supplication.
rTIME.
Modulation inclucles, also, the considlration of time, which is natural in tlhe
pronunciation of certain passages. The combinations, then, of pitch, force
and timne, are extremely numerous: thus, we have low, loud, slow; low, soft,
slow; low, feeble, slow; low, loud, quick, &amp;c.; middle, loud, slow; middle,
soft, slow; middle, feeble, slow, &amp;c. Thus, we have a copious natural language, adapted to the expression of every emotinn and passion.
IMITATIVE MODULATION.
Motion and sound, in all their modlfications, area in descriptive reacling,
more or less imitated.  To glide, to drive, to swell, to flow, to skip, to whirl,
to turn, to rattle, &amp;c., all partake of a peculiar modification of voice. This
expression lies in the key, force, and time of the tones, and the forcible pron-anciation of certain letters which are supposed more particularly to express
th e imiltation.
Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows,
And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;
But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,
The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roai
When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,
The line too labors, and the words move slow;
Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain,

courage to be able to bear the imputation of the want of courage. But
pride, vanity, egotism, so unamiable and offensive in private life, are
vices which partake of the character of crimes, in the conduct of public
affairs. The unfortunate victim of these passions cannot see beyond -the
little, petty, contemptible circle of his own personal interests. All his
thoughts are withdrawn from his country, and concentrated on his coinsistency, his firmness, himself!  The high, the exalted, the sublime
eniotions of a patri6tism which, soaring towards Heaven, rises far above
all mean, low, or selfish things, and is absorbed by one soul-transporting thought of the good and the glory of one's country, are never felt
in his impenetrable bosom. That patriotism which, catching its inspirations from the immortal God, and, leaving at an immeasurable distance
below all lesser, grovelling, personal interests and feelings, animates
and prompts to deeds of self-sacrifice, of valor, of devotion, and of
death itself, - that is public virtue; that is the noblest, the sublimest
of all public virtues!
168. TIIF, EXPUNGING RESOLUTION, 1837.-Henry Clay.
The Senate having, in 1834, passed resolutions to the effect that President Jackson had
assumed and exercised powers not granted by the Constitution, notice was given of a motion
to expunge the same, which motion was taken up and carried in 1837, when the majority of the
Senate was of a different party complexion.
WHAT patriotic purpose is to be accomplished by this expunging
resolution? Can you make that not to be which has been? Can you
eradicate from memory and from history the fact that, in March, 1834,
a majority of the Senate of the United States passed the resolution
which excites your enmity?     Is it your vain and wicked object to
arrogate to yourselves that power of annihilating the past which has
been denied to Omnipotence itself?   Do you intend to thrust your
hands into our hearts, and to pluck out the deeply-rooted convictions
which are there?    Or, is it your design merely to stigmatize us 2
You cannot stigmatize us!
"Ne'er yet did base dishonor blur our name."
Standing securely upon our conscious rectitude, and bearing aloft the
shield of the Constitution of our country, your puny efiorts are impotent, and we defy all your power!
But why should I detain the Senate, or needlessly waste my breath
in fruitless exertions?  The decree has gone forth.    It is one of
urgency, too.  The deed is to be done, - that foul deed, which, like
the stain on the hands of the guilty MIacbeth, all ocean's waters will
never wash out.   Proceed, then, to the noble work which lies before
you; and, like other skilful executioners, do it quickly.  And, when
you have perpetrated it, go home to the People, and tell them what
glorious honors you have achieved for our common country. Toll thenm
that you have extinguished one of the brightest and purest lights that
ever burnt at the altar of civil liberty.  Tell them  that you have
silenced one of the noblest batteries that ever thundered in d -fente of
B18the Constitutin, and that you have bravely spiked the cannon. Tell
them that, henceforward, no matter what d,aring or outrageous act any
President may perform, you have forever hermetically sealed the mouth
of the Senate. Tell them that he may fearlessly assume what power
he pleases, - snatch from its lawful custody the Public Purse, command a military detachment to enter the halls of the Capitol, overa we
Congress, trample down the Constitution; and raze every bulwark of
freedom, --but that the Senate must stand mute, in silent submission,
and not dare to lift an opposing voice; that it must wait until a House
of Representatives, humbled and subdued like itself, and a majority of
it comnposed of the partisans of the President, shall prefer articles of
impeachment. Tell them, finally, that you have restored the glorious
doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance; and, when you have
told them this, if the People do not sweep you from your places with
their indignation, I have yet to.learn the character of American freemen!
169. ON RECOGNIZING THE INDEPENDENCE OF GREECE, 1524. -- Clay.
ARE we so low, so base, so despicable, that we may not express our
horror, articulate our detestation, of the most brutal and atrocious war
that ever stained earth, or shocked high Heaven, with the ferocious deeds
of a brutal soldiery, set on by the clergy and followers of a fanatical and
inimical religion, rioting in excess of blood and butchery, at the mere
details of which the heart sickens? If the great mass of Christendom can
look coolly and calmly on, while all this is perpetrated on a Christian
People, in their own vicinity, in their very presence, let us, at least,
show that, in this distant extremity, there is still some sensibility and
sympathy for Christian wrongs and sufferings; that there are still
feelings which can kindle into indigniation at the oppression of a People endeared to us by every ancient recollection, and every modern tie
But, Sir, it is not first and chiefly for Greece that I wish to see this
measure adopted. It will give them but little aid, - that aid purely
of a moral kind.  It is, indeed, soothing and solacing, in distress, to
hear the accents of a friendly voice. We know this as a People.
But, Sir, it is principally and mainly for America herself, for the credit
and character of our common country, that I hope to see this resolution pass  it is for our own unsullied name that I feel.
What appearance, Sir, on the page of history, would s record like
this nmake: -" In the month of January, in the year of our Lord and
Saviour 1824, while all European Christendom beheld with colcl,
anufeling apathy the unexampled wrongs and inexpressible misery of'
i]hristian Greece, a proposition was made in the Congress of the
UTnited  States, -almost the sole, the last, the greatest repository
of human hope and of human freedom, the representatives of a Nation
sapable of bringing into the field a million of bayonets, -while the
f'eeinen of tha.t Nation were spontaneously expressing its deep-toned
reeling. its fervrent prayer for Grecian success, while the whole Coan

tinent was rising, by one simultaneous motion, solemnly and anxiously
supplicating and invoking the aid of Heaven to spare Greece, and to
invigorate her arms; while temples and senate-houses were all resounding with one burst of generous sympathy;--in the year of our Lord
and Saviour, - that Saviour alike of Christian Greece and of us, - a
proposition was offered in the American Congress, to send a messenger
to Greece, to lnquire into her state and condition, with an expression
of our good wishes and our sympathies;-- and it was rejected!" Go
honme, if you dare,- go home, if you can,- to your constituents, and tell
them that you voted it down! Meet, if you dare, the appalling countenances of those who sent you here, and tell them that you shrank
fi'oml the declaration of your own sentiments; that, you cannot tell
how, but that some unknown dread, some indescribable apprehension,
some indefinable danger, affrighted you; that the spectres of cimeters,
and crowns, and crescents, gleamed before you, and alarmed you; and,
that you suppressed all the noble feelings prompted by religion, by liberty, by National independence, and by humanity! I cannot bring
myself to believe that such will be the feeling of a majority of this
House.
170. ON TIE PROSPECT OF'WAR, 1811.-John C. Calhoun. Born, 1782; died, 1850.
WE are told of the danger of war. We are ready to acknowledge
its hazard and misfortune, but I cannot think that we have any extraordinary danger to apprehend,- at least, none to warrant an acquiescence in the injuries we have received. On the contrary, I believe no
war would be less dangerous to internal peace, or the safety of the
country.
In speaking of Canada, the gentleman from Virginia introduced the
name of Montgomery with much feeling and interest.  Sir, there is
danger in that name to the gentleman's argument.  It'is sacred to
heroism! It is indignant of submission! It calls our memory back
to the time of our Revolution,--to the Congress of 1774 and 1775.
Suppose a speaker of that day had risen and urged all the arguments
which we have heard on this occasion: had told that Congress, "' Your
contest is about the right of laying a tax; the attempt on Canada has
nothing to do with it; the war will be expensive; danger and devasta,
tion will overspread our country, and the power of Great Britain is
irresistible "? With what sentiment, think you, would such doctrines
have been received? Happy for us, they had no force at that period
of our country's glory. Had such been acted on, this hall would never
have witnessed a great People convened to deliberate for the general
good; a mighty Empire, with prouder prospects than any Nation the
sun ever shQne on, would not have risen in the West. No! we would
have been vile, subjected Colonies' governed by that imperious rod
which Britain holds over her distar.t Provinces.
The Gentleman is at a loss to account for what he calls our hatred
to England. He asks, How can we hate the country of fLocke, of
820SENATORIAL. -- CALHOLN
Newton, tlampden and Chatham; a country having the same language
and customs with ourselves, and descended from a conlmon ancestry?
Sir, the laws of human affections are steady and uniform. If we have
so much to attach us to that country, powerful, indeed, must be the
cause which has overpowered it.  Yes, Sir; there is a cause strong
enough. Not that occult, courtly affection which he has supposed to
be entertained for France; but continued and unprovoked insult and
injury, -a cause so manifest, that the Gentleman had to exert much
ingenuity to overlook it. But, in his eager admiration of that country, he has not been sufficiently guarded in his argument. Has he
reflected on the cause of that admiration? Has he examined the reasons of our high regard for her Chatham? It is his ardent patriotism nis heroic courage, which could not brook the least insult or
injury offered to his country, but thought that her interest and honor
ought to be vindicated, be the hazard and expense what they might.
I hope, when we are called on to admire, we shall also be asked to
imitate.
171. AGAINST THE FORCE BILL, 1833. - John C. Calhoun.
IT is said that the bill ought to pass, because the law must be
enforced.  The law must be enforced!  The irmperial edict must be
excutited! It is under such sophistry, couched in general terms, without looking to the limitations which must ever exist in the practical
exercise of power, that the most cruel and despotic acts ever have been
covered. It was such sophistry as this that cast Daniel into the lions'
den, and the three Innocents into the fiery furnace.  Under the same
sophistry the bloody edicts of Nero and Caligcila were executed.  Tlhe
l4aw must be enforced!  Yes, the act imposing the tea-tax " must be
executed." This was the very argument which impelled Lord North
and his administration in that mad career which forever separated us
from the British Crown. Under a similar sophistry, "that religion
must be protected," how many massacres have been perpetrated, and
how many martyrs have been tied to the stake! What! acting ona
this vaguc abstraction, are you prepared to enforce a law, without considering whether it be just or unjust, constitutional or unconstitutional? Will you collect money when it is acknowledged that it is
not wanted?  He who earns the money, who digs it from the earth
with the sweat of his brow, has a just title to it, against the universe.
NrL olle has a right to touch it without his consent, except his govern,
men t, and that only to the extent of its legitimate wants;-- to take
more is robbery; and you propose by this bill to enforce robbery by
murder   Yes! to this result you must come, by this mniserable sophistry, this vague abstraction of enforcing the law, without a regard to
the fact whether the law be just or unjust, constitutional c unconstitutional!
In the same spirit we are told that the Union must be p:eserved,
without regard to the means. And how is it proposed to preserve the

321THE STANDARD SPEAKER.

ieautiful striucture, this harmonious aggregate of States, produced by
the joinit consent of all, canl be preserved by force?  Its very introduction would be the certain destruction of this Federal Union. No,
lno! You cannot keep the States united in their constitutional and fedoral bonds by force.  Has reason fled from our borders? Have we
aeased to reflect?  It is madness to suppose that the Union can be
preserved by force.  I tell you, plainly, that the Bill, should it pass,
c annot be enforced.  It will prove only a blot upon your statute-book,
a reproach to the year, and a disgrace to the American Senate.  I
repeat that it will not be executed; it will rouse the dormant spirit of
the People, and open their eyes to the approach of despotisni.  The
country has sunk into avarice and political corruption, from which
nothing can arouse it but some measure on the part of the Government, of folly and madness, such as that now under consideration.
172. THE PURSE AND TIIE SWORD, 1836.-John C. Calhoun.
THERE was a time, in the better days of the Republic, when, to show
what ought to be done, was to insure the adoption of the measure.
Those days have passed away, I fear, forever.  A power has risen up
in the Government greater than the People themselves, consisting of
nmany, and various, and powerful interests, combined into one mass,
and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in the
bainkls. This mighty combination will be opposed to any change; and
it is to be feared that, such is its influence, no measure to which it is
opposed can become a law, however expedient and necessary; and that
the public money will remain in their possession, to he disposed of, not
as the public interest, but as theirs, may dictate.  The time, indeed,
seems fast approaching, when no law can pass, nor any honor can be conferred, from the Chief Magistrate to the tide-waiter, without the assent
of this powerful and interested combination, which is steadily becoming
the Government itself, to the utter subversion of the authority of the
People. Nay, I fear we are in the midst of it; and I look with
anxiety to the fate of this measure, as tlhe test whether we are or not.
If nothing should be done, - if the money which j,Lstly belongs to:the People be left where it is, with the many and overwhelming objections to it, - the fact will prove that a great a  reat and adical change has been
efiected; that the Government.is subverted; that the authority of the
People is suppressed by a union of the banks and the Executive, - a
otnion a hundred times more dangerous than that of Church and State,
against which the Constitution has so jealously guarded.  It would be
the announccment of a state of things, firom which, it is to be feared,
there can be no recovery, -a state of boundless corruption, and the
lowest anct basest subserviency.  It seemis to be the order of Providence that, with the exception of these, a People may recover from
any other evil.  Piracy, roblbery, and violence of every description
maay as history proves, be succeeded by virtue, pat,riotism, and nat.ion
322SENATORIAL. - CALHOUN.                     64't
al greatiness; but where is the example to be found of' a degenerate,
corrupt, and subservient People, who have ever recovered their virtue
and patriotism? Their doom has ever been the lowest state of wretchedness and misery: scorned, trodden down, and obliterated forever
from tile list of nations! May Heaven grant that such may never be
our (loom!
173. LIBERTY TITE MEED OF INTELLIGENCE, 1848. -John C. Calhoun.
SOCIETY can no more exist without Government, in one form or
anlother, than man without society.  It is the political, then, which
includes the social, that is his natural state.  It is the one for which
his Creator formed hiln, into which he is impelled irresistibly, and in
which only his race can exist, and all his faculties be fully developed.
Such being the case, it follows that any, the worst form of Governmnent, is better than anarchy; and that individual liberty, or freedom,
must be subordinate to whatever power may be necessary to protect
society against anarchy within, or destruction from without: for the
safety and well-being of society are as paramount to individual liberty,
as the safety and well-being of the race is to that of individuals; and,
in the same proportion, the power necessary for the safety of society
is paramount to individual liberty. On the contrary, Government has
no right to control individual liberty, beyond what is necessary to the
safety and well-being of society.  Such is the boundary which separates the power of Government, and the liberty of the citizen, or subject, in the political state, which, as I have shown, is the natural state
of man, - the only one in whioh his race can exist, and the one in
which he is born, lives, and dies.
It follows, from all' this, that the quanturn of power on the part of
the.Government, and of liberty on that of individuals, instead of being
equal in all cases, must, necessarily, be very unequal among different
people, according to their different conditions. For, just in proportion
as a People are ignorant, stupid, debased, corrupt, exposed to violence
within and danger without, the power necessary for Government to
possess, in order to preserve society against anarchy and destruction,
becomes greater and greater, and individual liberty less and less, until
the lowest condition is reached, when absolute and despotic power becomes necessary on the part of the Governument, and individual liberty
extinct.  So, on the contrary, just as a People rise in the scale of
intelligelce, virtiue and patriotism, and the more perfectly they be.

174. POPULAR INTEREST IN ELECTIONS. - Geo..McDuffie.
CRierge 5lcDuffie, a distinguished citizen of South Carolina, studied law with John 0. CalL )un, and entered Congress in 1821, where he gained great reputation as a Speaker. IIis style
of elocution was passionate and impetuous. IIe died in 1851.
VYE have been frequently told that the flarmer should attend to his
plough, and the mechanic to his handicraft, during the canvass for the
Presidency.  Sir, a more dangerous doctrine could not be inculcated.
If there is any spectacle from the contemplation of which I would
shrink with peculiar horror, it would be that of the great mass of the
American People sunk into a profound apathy on the subject of their
highest political interests. Such a spectacle would be more portentous,
to the eye of intelligent patriotism, than all the monsters of the earth,
and fiery signs of the Heavens, to the eye of trembling superstition.
If the People could be indifferent to the fate of a contest for the Presidency, they would be unworthy of freedom.
"Keep the People quiet! Peace! Peace!"       Such are the whispers by which the People are to be lulled to sleep, in the very crisis
of their highest concerns.  Sir, " you make a solitude, and call it
peace! "  Peace?'T is death! Take away all interest from the People in the election of their Chief Ruler, and liberty is no more.
What, Sir, is to be the consequence?  If the People do not elect the
President, somebody must. There is no special Providence to decide
the question.  Who, then, is to make the election, and how will it
operate? Make the People indifferent, destroy their legitimate influence, and you communicate a morbid violence to the efforts of those
who are ever ready to assume the control of such affairs, the mercenary intriguers and interested office-hunters of the country.  Tell n1
not, Sir of popular violence T  Show me a hundred political factionists, - men who look to the election of a President as a means of
gratifying their high or their low ambition, -  and I will show you the
very materials for a mob, ready for any desperate adventure, connected
with their common fortunes. The People can have no such mrotives;
they look only to the interest and glory of the country.
There was a law of Athens, which subjected every citizen to punishment, who refused to take sides in the political parties which divided
the Republic.  It was founded in the deepest wisdom.  The ambitious
few will inevitably acquire the ascendency, in the conduct of human
affairs, if the patriotic many, the People, are not'stimulated and
roused to a proper activity and effort.  Sir, no Nation on earth has
ever exerted so extensive an influence on human affairs as this will

certainly exercise, if we preserve our glorious system of Government
in its purity. The liberty of this country is a sacred depository - a
vestal fire, which Providence has committed to us for the general benefit
of mankind. It is the world's last hope. Extinguish it, and the
earth will be covered with eternal darkness.  But once put out that
fire, and I " know not where is the Promethean heat which can that
light relume."
175. MILITARY QUALIFICATIONS DISTINCT FROM CIVIL, 1828. -John bergea,I
IT has been maintained that the genius which constitutes a grea+
military man is a very high quality, and may be equlally useful in the
Cabinet and in the field; that it has a sort of universality equally
applicable to all affairs. We have seen, undoubtedly, instances of a
rare aind wonderfuil combination of civil and military qualifications
both of the highest order. That the greatest civil qualifications may
be found united with the highest military talents, is what no one will
deny who thinks of Washington. But that such a combination is
rare and extraordinary, the fame of TWashington sufficiently attests.
If it were common, why was he so illustrious?
I would ask, what did Cromwell, with all his military genius, do
for England? He overthrew the Monarchy, and he established Dictatorial power in his own person.. And what happened next? Another soldier overthrew the Dictatorship, and restored the Monarchy
The sword effected both.  Cromwell made one revolution; and Monk
another.  And what did the People of England gain by it?
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing! The rights and liberties of Englishmen, aAsthey now exist, were settled and established at the Revolution
in 1688. Now, mark the difference! By whom was that Revolution begun and conducted?  Was it by soldiers?  by military
genius? by the sword? No! It was the work of statesmen and
of eminent lawyers,- men never distinguished for military exploits
The faculty -the dormant faculty - may have existed. That is what
no one can affirm or deny. But it would have been thought an
absurd and extravagant thing to propose, in reliance upon this possible
dormant faculty, that one of those eminent statesmen and lawyers
should be sent, instead of the Duke of Marlborough, to command the
English forces on the Continent!
Who achieved the freedotn and the independence of this our own
country? Washington effected much in the field; but where were
t,he Franklins, the Adamses, the Hancockls, the Jeffersons, and the
Lees,--the band of sages and patriots, whose memory we revere?
They were assembled in Council. The heart of the Revolution beat
in the Hall of Congress.  There was the power which, beginning
with appeals to the King and to the British Nation, at length made
an irresistible appeal to the world, and consummated the Revolutior
by the Declaration of Independence, which Washington established
with taeir authority, and, bearing their commis,sion, supported by
32bTHE STANDARD BPEAKER.
arms. And what has this band of patriots, of sages, and of statesmen, given to us? Not what Caesar gave to Rome; not what Cromwell gave to England, or Napoleon to France: they established for.ws
the great principles of civil, political, and religious liberty, upon the
strong foundations on which they have hitherto stood. There may
have been military capacity in Congress; but can any one deny that
it is to the wisdom of sages, Washington being one, we are
indebted for the signal blessings we enjoy,?
176. OPPOSITION TO MISGOVERNMENT, 1814.- Webster.
ALL the evils which afflict the country are imputed to opposition.
It is said to be owing to opposition that the war became necessary, and
owing to opposition, also, that it has been prosecuted with no better
success. This, Sir, is no new strain. It has been sung a thousand
times. It is the constant tune of every weak and wicked administration. What minister ever yet acknowledged that the evils which
fell on his country were the necessary consequences of his own incapacity, his own folly, or his own corruption? What possessor of
political power ever yet failed to charge the mischiefs resulting fromn
his own measures upon those who had uniformly opposed those imeasures?  The people of the United States may well remember the
administration of Lord North. He lost America to his country, yet
he could find pretences for throwing the odium upon his opponents.
-IHe could throw it upon those who had forewarned him of consequences, and who had opposed him, at every stage of his disastrous
policy, with all the force of truth, reason and talent.  It way not his
own weakness, his own ambition, his own love of arbitrary power, that
disaffected the Colonies. It was not the Tea Act, the Stamp Act,
the Boston Port Bill, that severed the empire of Britain. 0, no!
It was owing to no fault of Administration. It was the work of
Opposition. It was the impertinent boldness of Chatham, the idle
declamation of Fox, the unseasonable sarcasm of Barre. These men,
and men like them, would not join the minister in his American war.
They would not give the name and character of wisdom to what they
believed to be the extreme of folly. They would not pronounce those
measures just and honorable which their principles led them to condemn. They declared the minister's war to be wanton. They foresaw its end, and pointed it out plainly, both to the minister and to the
country. He declared their opposition to be selfish and factious. He
persisted in his course; and the result is in history.
Important as I deem it, Sir, to discuss, on all proper occasions, the
policy of the measures at present pursued, it is still more important
to maintain the right of such discussion in its full and just extent.
Sentiments lately sprung up, and now growing popular, render it
necessary to be explicit on this point. It is the ancient and constitutional right of this people to canvass public measures, and the merit
326BENATORIAL. - WEBSTER.
of public men. It is a home-bred right, a fireside f;ivilege. It has
ever been enjoyed in every house, cottage and cabin, in the Nation.
It is not to be drawn into controversy.  It is as undoubted as the
right of breathing the air and walking on the earth.  Belonging to
private life as a right, it belongs to public life as a duty; and it is
the last duty which those whose representative I am  shall find nime
to abandon.  This high constitutional privilege I shall defend and
exercise within this House, and without this House, and in all places;
in time of war, in time of peace, and at all times.  Living, I will
assert it; dying, I will assert it; and, should I leave no other legacy to
my children, by the blessing of God I will leave them the inheritance
of free principles, and the example of a manly, independent, and
constitutional defence of the m!
177. MORAL FORCE AGAINST PHYSICAL, JAN. 19, 1823. - Tebster.
THE tilne has been, Sir, indeed, when fleets, and armies, and subsidies, were the principal reliances, even in the best cause. But, happily for mankind, there has come a great change in this respect.
Moral causes come into consideration, in proportion as the progress of
kaowledge is advanced; and the public opinion of the civilized world
Is rapidly gaining an ascendeficy over mere brutal force. It is already
able to oppose the most formidable obstruction to the progress of
injustice and oppression; and, as it grows nmore intelligent, and more
intense, it will be more and more formidable.  It may be silenced by
military power, but it cannot be conquered.  It is elastic, irrepressible, and invulnerable to the weapons of ordinary warfare.  It is that
impassable, unextinguishable enemy of mere violence and arbitrary
rule, which, like Milton's angels,
"Vital- in every part,
Cannot, out by annihilating, die,"
UJntil this be propitiated or satisfied, it is in vain for power to talk
either of triumphs or of repose.  No matter what fields are desolated,
what fortresses surrendered, what armies subdued, or what provinces
overrun.  In the history of the year that has passed by us, and in
the instance of unhappy Spain, we have seen the vanity of all triumnphs, in a cause which violates the general sense of justice of the
civilized world.  It is nothing that the troops of France have passed
from the Pyrenees to Cadiz; it is nothing that an unhappy and pros.
trate Nation has fallen before them; it is nothing that arrests, and
confiscation, and execution, sweep away the little remnant of national
existence.  There is an enemy that still exists, to check the gloiy of
these triumphs.  It follows the conqueror back to the very scene of
his ovations; it calls upon him to take notice that Europe, though
silent, is yet indignant; it shows him that the seceptre of his victory
is a barren sceptre, --that it shall confer neither joy nor honor, but
shall moulder to dry ashes in his grasp.  In th  midst of his exulltwa

ing. In some treatises, the pause at the period is described as boing uni.
formly four times as long as that at a comma; whereas, it is regulated entirely
oy the nature of the subject, the intimacy-or remoteness of the connection
between the sentences, and other causes. "I am convinced," says Mr.
Kixowles, "that a nice attention to rhetorical punctuation has an extremely
mischievous tendency, and is totally inconsistent with nature.  Give the
aense of what you read-  MIND is the thing. Pauses are essential only where
the omission would obscure the sense. The orator, who, in the act of delivering himself, is studiously solicitous about parcelling his words, is sure to
leave the best part of his work undone. He delivers words, not thoughta
Deliver thoughts, and words will take care enough of themselves."
EMPHASIS.
By emphacis is meant that stronger and fuller sound of voice, by which, in
reading or speaking, we distinguish the accented syllable, or some word, on
which we design to lay particular stress, in order to show how it affects the
rest of the sentence. On the right management of the emphasis depend the
whole life and spirit of every discourse. If no emnphasis be placed on any
word, not only is discourse rendered heavy and lifeless, but the meaning left
zften ambiguous. If the emphasis be placed wrong, we pervert and confound
~he meaning wholly.   In order to acquire the proper management of the
emphasis, then, the great rule, and, indeed, the only unexceptional rule, is,
that the speaker or reader study to attain a just conception of the force and
spirit of those forms of expression which he is to pronounce.
To give a common instance: such a simple question as this, "Do you ride
to town to-day?" is capable of no fewer than four acceptations, according as
the emphasis is differently placed on the words. If it be pronounced thus:
Do you ride to town to-day? the answer may naturally be, N6; I send my
servant in my stead. If thus: Do you ride to town to-day? Answer. No;
I intend to walkc. Do you ride to town to-day?   No; I ride out into the
fields. Do you ride to town to-day? No; but I shall to-morrow. And there
is yet another expression that this little sentence is capable of, which would
be given by placing the emphasis on the first word, do, being a necessary
enforcement of the question, if the person asked had evaded giving a reply
thus: "Do you ride to town to-day?" The tone implying: Come, tell me at
once, do you, or do you not?
There are four obvious distinctions in the sound of words, with respect tc
force. First, the force necessary for the least important words, such as conjunctions, particles, &amp;c., which may be called feeble or utaccented. Second
the force necessary for substantives, verbs, &amp;c., which may be called accented.
Third, that force which is used for distinguishing some words from  others,
commonly called emphasis of force. Fourth, the force necessary for emphasi's
of sense. As opposition is the foundation of all emphasis of sense, whatever
words are contrasted with, contradistinguished from, or set in opposition to,
ma another, they are always emphatic. Hence, whenever there is antithesis
in the sense, whether words, or clauses, there ought to be emphasis in the prcnunciation.
The variations of emphasis are so numerous as to defy the formation
of rules that can be appropriate in all cases. Give a dozen well-trained
elocutionists a sentence to mark emphatically, and probably no two would
perform the task precisely alike.

178. SYMPATHY WITH SOUTH-AMERICAN REPUBLICANISM, 1826.--FFebster.
WE are told that the country is deluded and deceived by cabalistic
words. Cabalistic words! If we express an emotion of pleasure at
the results of this great action of the spirit of political liberty; if we
rejoice at the birth of new republican Nations, and express our joy by
the common terms of regard and sympathy; if we feel and signify
high gratification, that, throughout this whole Continent, men are now
likely to be blessed by firee and popular institutions; and if, in the
uttering of these sentiments, we happen to speak of sister Republics,
of the great American family of Nations, or of the political systems
and forms of Government of this hemisphere, - then, indeed, it seeins,
we deal in senseless jargon, or impose on the judgment and feeling of
the community by cabalistic words! Sir, what is meant by this? Is
it intended that the People of the United States ought to be totally
indifferent to the fortunes of these new neighbors?  Is no change, in
the lights in which we are to view them, to be wrought, by their having thrown off foreign dominion, established independence, and instituted, on our very borders, republican Governments, essentially after
our own example?
Sir, I do not wish to overrate - I do not overrate - the progress
of these new States, in the great work of establishirng a well-secured
popular liberty.  I know that to be a great attainment, and I know
they are but pupils in the school. But, thank God, they are in the
school! They are called to meet difficulties such as nleither we nor
our fathers encountered.  For these we ought to make large allowances. What have we ever known like the colonial vassalage of these
States?  Sir, we sprang from another stock. We belong to another
race.  We have known nothing -we have felt nothing -of the
political despotislt of Spain, nor of the heat of he-: files of intolerance.
No rational man expects that the South can run the same rapid career
as the Nortl, or that an insurgent province of' Spain is in the same
condition as the English Colonies when they first asserted their independence.  There is, doubtless, much more to be done in the first than
in the last case. But, on that account, the honor of the attempt is
not less; and, if all difficulties shall be, in time, surmounted, it will by
greater. The work may be more arduous. - it is not less noble,--
becatse there may be more of ignorance to enlighten, more of b'igotry
to subdue, more of prejudice to eradicate.  If it be a weakness t/) feel
a strong interest in the success of these great revolutions, I confess
myself guilty of that weakness.  If it be weak to feel that I am an

modes of inltercourse but have created, also, new grounclds of regard
and sympathy, between ourselves and our neighbors; if it be weak to
feel that the South, in her present state, is somewhat more emphatically a part of America than when she lay, obscure, oppressed, and
unknown, under the grinding bondage of a foreign power; if it be weak
to rejoice when, even in any corner of the earth, human beings are able
to get up from beneath oppression, - to erect themselves, and to enjoy
the proper happiness of their intelligent nature, - if this be weak, it iW
a weakness from which I claim no exemption.
179. HATRED OF THE POOR TO THE RICH, 1834.-- Websteu.
SIR, I see, in those vehicles which carry to the People sentiments
from high places, plain declarations that the present controversy is but
a strife between one part of the community and another. I hear it
boasted as the unfailing security,- the solid ground, never to be
shaken, - on which recent measures rest, that the poor naturally hate
the rich.  I know that, under the shade of the roofs of the Capitol,
within the last twenty-four hours, among men sent here to devise
means for the public safety and the public good, it has beel vaunted
forth, as matter of boast and triumph, that one cause existed, powerful
enough to support everything and to defend everything, and that was,
- the natural hatred of the poor to the rich.
Sir, I pronounce the author of such sentiments to be guilty of
attempting a detestable fraud on the community; a doubie fraud,a fraud which is to cheat men out of their property, and out of the
earnings of their labor, by first cheating them out of their understandings.
" The natural hatred of the poor to the rich"'Sir, it shall not
be till the last moment of my existence; -  it shall be only when I am
drawn to the verge of oblivion, - when I shall cease to have respect
or affection for anything on earth, - that I will believe the people of
the United States capable of being effectually deluded, cajoled, and
driven about in herds, by such abominable frauds as this. If they
shall sink to that point, - if they so far cease to be men - thinking
men, intelligent men - as to yield to such pretences and such clamor,
- they will be slaves already; slaves to their own passions, slaves to
the fraud and knavery of pretended friends. They will deserve to be
blotted out of all the records of freedom. They ouglt not to dishonor
the cause of self-government, by atteipting any longer -to exercise it.
They ought to keep their unworthy hands entirely off from the cause
of republican liberty, if they are capable of being the victims of artifices so shallow, - of tricks so stale, so threadbare, so often practised,
so much worn out, on serfs and slaves.
"The natural hatred of the poor against the rich!"  "The danger
of a moneyed aristocracy!' "A power as gr3at and dangerous as that

Sil, I adn.nish the People against the objects of outcrlies like these.,
I admonish every industrious laborer in the country to be on his guard
against such delusions.  I tell him the attempt is to play off his passions against his interests, and to prevail on him, in the name of' liberty,
to destroy all the fruits of liberty; in the name of patriotism, to injure
and afflict his country; and in the name of his own independence, to
destroy that very independence, and make him a beggar and a slave!
180. ON SUDDEN POLITICAL CONYERSIONS, 1838.- IVebster.
MR. PRESIDENT, public men must certainly be allowed to change
their opinions, and their associations, whenever they see fit. No one
doubts this. Mein may have grown wiser, - they may have attained
to betterl and more correct views of great public subjects.  Nevertheless, Sir, it niust be acknowledged, that what appears to be a sudden,
as well as a great change, naturally produces a shock.  I confess, for
one, I was shocked, when the honorable gentleman,* at the last session,
espoused this billt of the Administration.  Sudden niovements of the
affections, whether personal or political, are a little out of nature.
Several years ago, Sir, some of the wits of England wrote a mock
play, intended to ridicule the unnatural and false feeling -  the sentimentahlt - of a certain German school of literature.  In this play,
two strangers are brought together at an inn.  While they are warming themselvcs at the nire, and before their acquaintance is yet five
minutes old, one springs up, and exclaims to the other, "A sudden
thought strikes me! - Let us swear an eternal friendship! "
This affectionate offer was instantly accepted, and the friendship duly
sworn, unchangeable and eternal! Now, Sir, how long this eternal
friendship lasted, or in what manner it ended, those who wish to know
may learn by referring to the play.  But it seems to me, Sir, that the
honorable member has carried his political sentimentality a good deal
higher than the flight of the German school; for he appears to have
fallen suddenly in love, not with strangers, but with opponents. Here
we all had been, Sir, contending against the progress of Executive
power, and more particularly, and most strenuously, against the projects and experiments of the Administration upon the currency.  The
honorable mnember stood among us, not only as an associate, but as a
leader.  We thought we were making some headway.    The People
appeared to be coming to our support and our assistance.  The country
nad been roused; every successive election weakening the strength of the
adversary, and increasing our own. We were in this career cf success,
carried strongly forward by the current of public opinion, and only
needed to hear the cheering voice of the honorable member,"Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more!"

oehold! in the very crisis of our affairs, on the very eve of victory,
the honorable member cries out to the enemy, --not to us, his
allies, but to the enemy,--" Holloa! a sudden thought strikes me'
- I abandon my allies! Now I think of it, they have always been my
oppressors! I abandon them; and now let you and me swear an eter
nal friendship!  
Such a proposition, from such a quarter, Sir, was not likely to &gt;X
Iong withstood.  The other party was a little coy, but, upon the whole,
nothing loath. After proper hesitation, and a little decorous blushing,
it owned the soft impeachment; admitted an equally sudden sympathetic impulse on its own side; and, since few words are wanted where
hearts are already known, the honorable gentleman takes his place
among his new friends, amidst greetings and caresses, and is already
snljoying the sweets of an eternal friendship.
181. THE PLATFORM OF TIlE CONSTITUTION, 1838.-- Webster.
A PRINCIPAL object, in his late political movements, the gentleman himself tells us, was to unite the entire South; and against whom,
or against what, does he wish to unite the entire South? Is not this
the very essence of local feeling and local regard? Is it not the
acknowledgment of a wish and object to create political strength, by
uniting political opinions geographically? While the gentleman wishes
to unite the entire South, I pray to know, Sir, if he expects me to turn
toward the polar-star, and, acting on the same principle, to utter a cry
of PRally! to the whole North?  Heaven forbid! To the day of my
death, neither he nor others shall hear such a cry fi'om me.
Finally, the honorable member declares that he shall now march off,
under the banner of State rights! March off from whom? March
off from what?  We have been contending for great principles.  We
have been struggling to maintain the liberty and to restore the prosperity of the country; we have made these struggles here, in the national
councils, with the old flag - the true American flag, the Eagle and the
Stars and Stripes - waving over the Chaml,ber in which we sit. He uoni
tells us, however, that he marches off under the State-rights banner  
Let him go. I remain.   I am, where I ever have been, and ever
mean to be. Here, standing on the platform of the general Constitution, - a platform  broad enough, and firm  enough, to uphold every
interest of the whole country, - I shall still be found. Intrusted with
some part in the administration of that Constitution, I intend to act; in
its spirit, and in the spirit of those who framed it. Yes, Sir. I would,act as if our fathers, who formed it for us, and who bequeathed it to
ua, were looking on me, - as if I could see their venerable forms,
bending down to behold us from the abodes above! I would act, too,
as if the eye of posterity was gazing o n nme.
Standing thus, as in the full gaze of our ancestors and our posterity,

182. RESISTANCE TO OPPRESSION IN ITS RUDIMENTS. --Daniel Webster
EVERY encroachment, great or small, is important enough to awaken
the attention of those who are intrusted with the preservation of a
Constitutional Government.  We are not to wait till great public
mischiefs come, till the government is overthrown, or liberty itself put
in extreme jeopardy.  We should not be worthy sons of our fathers,
were we so to regard great questions affecting the general freedom.
Those fathers accomplished the Revolution on a strict question of principle. The Parliament of Great Britain asserted a right to tax the
Colonies in all cases whatsoever; and it was precisely on this question
that they made the Revolution turn.  The amount of taxation was
trifling, but the claim itself was inconsistent with liberty; and that
was, in their eyes, enough. It was against the recital of an act of
Parliament, rather than against any suffering under its enactments,
that they took up arms. They went to war against a preamble. They
fought seven years against a declaration.  They poured out their
treasures and their blood like water, in a contest, in opposition to an
assertion, which those less sagacious and not so well schooled in the
principles of civil liberty would have re(garded as barren phraseology,
or mere parade of words. They saw in the claim of the British Pariiament a seminal principle of mischief, the germ of unjust power;
they detected it, dragged it forth froom  underneath its plausible disguises, struck at it, nor did it elude either their steady eye, or their
well-directed blow, till they had extirpated and destroyed it, to the
smallest fibre. On this question of principle, while actual suffering
was yet afar off, they raised their flag against a power to which, for
urposes of foreign conquest and subjugation, Rome, in the height ot
her glory, is not to be compared; a power which has dotted over the
surface of the whole globe with her possessions and military posts;
whose morning drum-beat, following the sun, and keeping company
with the hours, circles the earth daily with one continuous anw
unbroken strain of the martial airs of England.

183. PEACEABLE SECESSION, 1850.-- Webster.
SIR, he who sees these States now revolving in harmony around a
-omnmon centre, and expects to see them quit their places and fly off
without convLlsion, may look the next hour to see the heavenly bodiea
rush from their spheres, and jostle against each other in the realms of
space, without causing the crush of the universe. There can be no
such thing as a peaceable secession.  Peaceable secession is an utter
impossibility. Is the great Constitution under which we live, covering
this whole country, is it to be thawed and melted away by secession,
as the snows on the mountain melt under the influence of a vernal sun,

not state what might produce the disruption of the Union: but, Sir, I
see, as plainly as I see the sun in Heaven, what that disruption itself
must produce; I see that it must produce war, and such a war as I
will not describe, in its two-fold chcracter.
Peaceable secession! - peaceable secession! The concurrent agreement of all the members of this great Republic to separate! A voluntary separation, with alimony on one side and on the other.  Why,
whats would be the result?  Where is the line to be drawn? What
States are to secede?  What is to remain American?  WMhat am I to
be?  An American no longer?   Am I to become a sectional man, a
local man, a separatist, with no countriy in common with the gentle.
nmen who sit around me here, or who fill the other House of Congress?
lHeaven forbid! Where is the flag of the Republic to remain? Where
is the eagle still to tower?- or is he to cower, and shrink, and fall to the
ground? Why, Sir, our ancestors - our fathers and our grandfathers,
those of them that are yet living amongst us, with prolonged lives--
would rebuke and reproach us; and our children and our grandchildren
would cry out shame upon us, if we, of this generation, should dishonor these ensigns of the power of the Government and the harmony
of that Uliion, which is every day felt among us with so much joy and
gratitude.  What is to become of the army?  What is to become of
the navy?  What is to become of the public lands?  How is any one
of the thirty States to defend itself?
Sir, we could not sit down here to-day, and draw a line of separation that would satisfy any five men in the country.  There are natu.
ral causes that would keep and tie us together; and there are social
and domestic relations which we could not break if we would, and
which we should not if we could.
184. ON MR. CLAY'S RESOLUTIONS, MARCH 7, 1850.- - ebster.
AND now, MIr. President, instead of speaking of the possibility or

instead of groping with those ideas so full of all that is horrid and

consideration and our action; let us raise our concepuons to the nlag.
niude and the importance of the duties that devolve upon us; let our
comprehension ne as broad as the country for which we act, our aspirations as high as its certain destiny; let us not be pigmies in a case
that calls for men. Never did there devolve on any generation of men
higher trusts than now devolve upon us, for the preservation of this
Constitution, and the harmony and peace of all who are destined to live
under it. Let us make our generation one of the strongest and brightest linIks in that golden chain, which is destined, I fondly believe, to
grapple the' People of all the States to this Constitution for ages to
come.
-'We have a great, popular, constitutional Governlient, guarded by
law and by judicature, and defended by the whole affections of the
Peopie. No monarchical throne presses these States together; no iron
chain of militaryv power encircles them; they live and stand upon a
Government popular in its form, representative in its character, founded
upon principles of equality, and so constructed, we hope, as to last forever.  In all its history it has been beneficent; it has trodden down
no man's liberty, - it has crushed no State.  Its daily respiration is
liberty and patriotism; its yet youthful veins are full of enterprise,
courage, and honorable love of glory and renown.  Large before, the
country has now, by recent events, become vastly larger. This iRepublie now extends, with a vast breadth, across the whole Continent. The
two great seas of the world wash the one and the other shore.  We
realize, on a mighty scale, the beautiful description of tlle ornamental
edging of the buckler of Achilles, -
" Now the broad shield complete, the artist crowned
With his last hand, and poured the ocean round:
In living silver seemed the waves to roll,
And beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole."
185. JUSTICE TO THE WHOLE COUNT/RY, JULY 17, 1850.- Webster
I THINK, Sir, the country calls upon us loudly and imperatively to
ettle this question.  I think that the whole world is looking to see
whetler this great popular CGovernment can get through such a crisis.
WVe are tlhe observed of all observers.  It is not to be disputed or
doubted, that the eyes of all Christendom are upon us.  We have
stood through many trials.  Can we stand through this, which takes
so much the character of a sectional coiltroversy? Can we stand that?
Therc1e is no inquiring man in all Europe who does not ask himself that
question every day, when he reads the intelligence of the morning.
Can -this country, with one set of interests at the South, and another
set of interests at the North,--these interests supposed, but falsely sup
posed, to be at variance, - can this People see, what is so evident to the
whole world beside, that this'Union is their main hope and greatest
benefit, and that their interests are entirely compatible?  Can they

the Nat,ons of tne earth, and their happiness at home, dependl 1poin
the ma'ntenance of their Union and their Constitution?     That is the
question. I agree that local divisions are apt to overturn the understandings of men, and to excite a belligerent feeling between section
and section.  It is natural, in times of irritation, for one part of the
country to say, if you do that I will do this, and so get up a feeling
of hostility and defiance.  Then comes belligerent legislation, and then
an appeal to arms. The question is, whether we have the true patri.
otismI, the Americanism, necessary to carry us through such a trial,
The whole world is looking towards us, with extreme anxiety.
For myself, I propose, Sir, to abide by the principles and the pur.
poses which I have avowed.     I shall stand by the Union, and by all
who stand by it.   I shatll do justice to the whole country, according
to the best of my ability, in all I say, -  and act for the good of the
whole country. in all I do.   I mean to stand upon the Constitution.
I need no other platform.   I shall know but one country.     The ends
I aim at shall be my country's, my God's, and Truth's.       I was borrt
an American; I live an Amnerican; I shall die an American         and I
intend to perform the duties incumbent upon me in that, character to
the end of my career. I mean to do this, with absolute disregard of
personal consequences.   What are personaI consequences?       What is
the individual man, with all the good or evil that may betide him, in
comparison with the good or evil which may befall a great country in
a crisis like this, and in the midst of great transactions which concern
that country's fate?   Let the consequences be what they will, I am
careless.  No man can suffer too much, and no man can fall too soon,
if he suffer, or if he fall, in defence of the liberties and Constitution
of his country!
186. MATCHES AND OVER-MATCHES, 1830.-Webster.
The following passage, and others by Mr. Webster which succeed it in this Department, are
from his speeches in reply to Mr. IHlayne, of South Carolina, in the Senate of the United States,
January, 1830. This celebrated intellectual combat, betwveen these distinguished men, grew out
of a Resolution offered by Mr. Foote, directing the committee on Public Lands to inquire inito
the quantity of the public lands remaining unsold, and other matters connected therewith.
This resolution afforded a text for a very irrelevant debate. Of the irrelevancy of Mr. Hayne's
remarks, Mr. Webster said: " ie has spoken of everything but the public lands. They have
escaped his notice. To that subject, in all his excursions, he has not even paid the cold respe".
of a passing glance."2
I AM not one of those, Sir, who esteem any tribute of regard, whethe,
light and occasional, or more serious and deliberate, which may be
bestowed on others, as so much unjustly withholden from themselves.
But the tone and manner of the gentleman's question forbid me thus
to interpret it.  I am   not at liberty to consider it as nothing more
than a civility to his friend.  It had an air of taunt and disparageinent, a little of the loftiness of asserted superiority, which does not
allow me to pass it over without notice.   It was put as a question for
7me to answer, and so put as if it were difficult for me to answer,
whetlher I deemed the member from Missouri an over-match for myself
in debate here.    It seems tome, Sir, that this is extraordinary lan.
guage, and an extraordinary tone,%for the discussions of this body.
835THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
3Matches and over-matches! Those terms are more applicable elsewhere than here, and fitter for other assenmblies than this.  Sir, the
gentleman seems to forget where and what we are. This is a Senate;
a Senate of equals; of men of individual honor and personal character,
and ofr absolute inclependence. TWe know no masters; we acknowledge
no dictators. This is a Hall for mutual consultation and discussion;
not an arena for the exhibition of champions. I offer myself, Sir, as
a match for no man; I throw the challerge of debate at no man's feet.
But, then, Sir, since the honorable member has put the question, in a
manner that calls for an answer, I will give him an answer; and 1
tell him, that, holding myself to be the humblest of the members here,
1 yet know nothing in the arm of his friend from Missouri, either
alone, or when aided by the arm of his friend from South Carolina,
that need deter even me from espousing whatever opinions I may
choose to espouse, from debating whenever I may choose to debate, or
from speaking whatever I may see fit to say, on the floor of the Senate.
Sir, when uttered as matter of commendation or compliment, I
should dissent from nothing which the honorable member might say
of his friend.  Still less do I put forth any pretensions of my own.
But, when put to me as matter of taunt, I throw it back, and say to
the gentleman that he could possibly say nothing less likely than such
a comparison to wound my pride of personal character.  The anger
of its tone rescued the remark from intentional irony, which, otherwise,
probably, would have been its general acceptation. But, Sir, if it be
irmagined that, by this mutual quotation and commendation; if it be
supposed that, by casting the characters of the drama, assigning to
each his part, - to one, the attack; to another, the cry of onset; - or,
if it be thought that, by a loud and empty vaunt of anticipated victory,
any laurels are to be won here; if it be imagined, especially, that any
or all these things shall shake any purpose of mine, - I can tell the
honorable member, once for all, that he is greatly mistaken, and that
he is dealing with one of whose temper and character he has yet nmuch
to learn. Sir, I shall not allow myself, on this occasion, - I hope on no
occasion, - to be betrayed into any loss of temper; but if provoked, as I
trust I never shall allow myself to be, into crimination and recrimination, the honorable member may, perhaps, fincld that in that contest
there will be blows to take, as well as blows to give; that others can
state comparisons as significant, at least, as his own; and that his
impunity may, perhaps, demand of him whatever powers of taunt and
sarcasm he may possess. I commend l'im to a prudent husbandry of
his resources.
187. SOUTH CAROLINA AND MASSACHUSETTS, 1830. -- Webster.
THE eulogium pronounced on the character of the State of South
Carolina, by the honorable gentleman, for her Revolutionary and other
merits, meets my hearty concurrence. I shall not acknowledge that
the honorable memtber goes before me in regard fbr whatever of distinSENATORIAL. -- WEBSTERt.
guished talent or distinguished character South Carolina has produced.
I clailn part of the honor, I partake in the pride of her great names.
I claiim them for countrymen, one and all. The Laurenses, the Rut-'edges, the Pinckneys, the Sumpters, the Marions, -Americans, all, -
whose fame is no more to be hemmed in by State lines, than their
talents and patriotism were capable of being circumscribed within ths
same narrow limits.  In their day and generation, they served and
honored the country, and the whole country; and their renown is of
the treasures of the whole country.  Him whose honored name the
gentleman hiniself bears,- does he suppose me less capable of gratitude for his patriotism, or sympathy for his sufferings, than if his,eyes
had first opened upon the light in Massachusetts, instead of South
Carolina? Sir, does he suppose it is in his power to exhibit a Carolina name so bright as to produce envy in my bosom?  No, Sir;
increased gratification and delight, rather.
Sir, I thank God, that, if I am gifted with little of the spirit which
is said to be able to raise mortals to the skies, I have yet none, as I
trust, of that other spirit, which would drag angels down.  When I
shall be found, Sir, in my place here, in the Senate, or elsewhere, to
sneer at public merit, because it happened to spring up beyond the
little limits of my own State or neighborhood; when I refuse, forany such cause, or for any cause, the homage due to American talent,
to elevated patriotismn, to sincere devotion to liberty and the country;
or, if I see an uncommon endowment of Heaven, - if I see extraor-.
dinary capacity and virtue in any son of the South,- and if, moved:
by local prejudice, or gangrened by State jealousy, I get up here tmo
abate the tithe of a hair from his just character and just fame, may
my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth! Sir, let me recur tol
pleasing recollections; let imie indulge in refreshing remembrance of'
the past; let me remind you that, in early times, no States cherished'
greater harniony, both of principle and feeling, than Mlassachusetts,
and South Carolina. - Would to God that harmony might again-,
return!  Shoulder to shoulder they went through the Revolution;
hand in hand they stood round the administration of Washington, aAd:
felt his own great arm lean on them for support.  Unkind feeling, if
it exist, - alienation and distrust,- are the growth, unnatural to such
soils, of false principles since sown. They are weeds, the seeds of
whlich that same gireat arm never scattered.
Mr. President, I shall enter on no encomium upon Massachusetts; -
she needs none. There she is, - behold her, and judge for yourselves.,
There is her history,  the -;orld knows it by heart. The past, at.ost, is secure.  There is 3,ston, and Concord, and Lexington, and
Bunker Hill, - and there th:y will remain forever. The bones of her
sons, fallen in the great stru,ggle for Independence, now lie mingled
with the soil of every State from New England to Georgia,- and
there they will lie forever. And, Sir, where American liberty raiscd:
its first voice, and where its youth was nurtured and sustaiinAd, therte.

And courage never to submit or yield, -
That glory never shall htis wrath or might
Extort from me.
The following speech of Othello is an example of what is termed cumulative
emphasis:
If thou dost slander her and torture me,
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
On horror's head horrors acclumulate;
Do deeds to makle Heave?r weep, all earth amazed--
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than this!
IIl. GESTUItE.
GESTURE, considered as a just and elegant adaptation of every part of the
body to the nature and import of the subject we are pronouncing, has always
3een considered as one of the most essential parts of Oratory. Cicero says,
that its power is even greater than that of words. It is the language of
nature in the strictest sense, and makes its way to the heart without the
uttterance of a single soundl.  I may threaten a inan with my sword by
speech, and produce little effect; but if I clap my hand to the hilt simulta--
ceously with the threat, he will be startled according(r to the earnestness of the
cetion. This instance will illustrate the whole theory of gesture. According
to Demosthenes, action is the beginning, the middle, and the end of Oratory.
To be perfectly motionless while we are pronouncing words which require
force and energy, is not only depriving them of their necessary support, but
rendering them unnatural and ridiculous. A very vehement address, pronounced without any motion but that of the lips and tongue, would be a burlesque upon the meaning, and produce laughter; nay, so unnatural is this
total absence of gesticulation, that it is not very easy to speak in this manner.
As some action, therefore, must necessarily accompany our words, it is of the
utmost consequence that this be such as is suitable and natural. No matter
how little, if it be but akin to the words and passion; for, if foreign to them,
it counteracts and destroys the very intention of delivery. The voice anr
gesture may be said to be tuned to each other; and, if they are in a diffirent
key, as it may be called, discord must inevitably be the consequence.
" A speaker's body," says Fenelon, " must betray action when there is
movement in his words; and his body must remain in repose when what he
utters is of a level, simple, unimpassioned character. Nothing seems to me,
so shocking and absurd as the sight of a man lashing himself to a fury in the
utterance of tame things. The more he sweats, the more he freezes my very
blood."
Mr. Austin, in his "Chironomia," was the first to lay down laws for the
regulation of gesture; and nearly all subsequent writers on the subject have
borrowed largely from his work. He illustrates his rules by plates, showing
the different attitudes and gestures for the expression of certain emotions.
Experience has abundantly provedl that no benefit is to be derived from the
study of these figures. They only serve as a subject for ridicule to boys; and
are generally found, in every volume in use, well pencilled over with satirical
marks or mottoes, issuing fromra the mouths of the stiff-looking gentlemen who
are presented as models of grace and expression to aspiring youth.
The tohilowing is an enumeration of some of the most frequent gestures, to
which the various members of the body contribute:
The Head anzd Face. The hanging down of the head denotes shame, or
grief. The holding it up, pride, or courage. To nod forward, implies assent.
To toss the head back, dissent. The inclination of the head implies bashfullulness or languor. The head is averted in dislike or horror. It leans forward in attention.THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
t still lives, in the strength of its manhood, and full of its origina.
spirit. If discord and disunion shall wound it, - if party strife and
blind ambition shall hawk at and tear it,--if folly and madness,
if uneasiness under salutary and necessary restraints, shall succeed to
separate it from that Union by which alone its existence is made
sure,- it will stand, in the end, by the side of that cradle in which its
infancy was rocked; it will stretch forth its arm, with whatever vigor
it may'still retain, over the friends who gather round it; and it will
fall at last, if fhll it must, amidst the proudest monuments of its own
glory, and on the very spot of its origin!
188. LIBERTY AND UNION, 1830.-F Webster.
I PROFESS, Sir, in my career hitherto, to have kept steadily in view
the prosperity and honor of the whole country, and the preservation
of our Federal Union. It is to that Union we owe our safety at
home, and our consideration and dignity abroad. It is to that Union'we are chiefly indebted for whatever nlakes us most proud of our.country.  That Union we reached only by the discipline of our'virtues, in the severe school of adversity.  It had its origin in the:necessities of disordered finance, prostrate commerce, and ruined
credit.  Under its benign influences, these great interests immediately awoke, as from the dead, and sprang forth with newness of life.
Every year of its duration has teemed with fresh proofs of its utility:and its blessings; and although our territory has stretched out wider;and wider, and our population spread further and further, they have.
mnot outran its protection, or its benefits. It has been to us all a copi-ous fountain of national, social, personal happiness. I have not.allowed myself, Sir, to look beyond the Union, to see what might lic
hlidden in the dark recess behind.  I have not coolly weighed the,chances of preserving liberty, when the bonds that unite us together
sha:11 be broken asunder.  I have not accustomed myself to hang
lover the precipice of disunion, to see whether, with my short sight, I.can fathom the depth of the abyss below; nor could I regard him as.a stlfe counsellor in the affairs of this Government whose thoughts,should be mainly bent on considering, not how the Union should be
best preserved, but how tolerable might be the condition of the
People when it shall be broken up and destroyed.
While the Union lasts, we have high, exciting, gratifying prospects
ipread out before us, for us and our children.  Beyond that I seek
siot to penetrate the veil. God grant that, in my day, at least, that
3urtain may not rise! God grant that on my vision never may b1-e
opened what lies behind! When my eyes shall be turned to behold,
bor the last time, the Sun in Heaven, may I not see him shining on'he broken and dishonored fragments of a once glorious Union; on'3tAtes severed, discordant, belligerent; on a land rent with civil feuds,', drenched. it may be, in fraternal blood! Let their last feeb'e and

-THE honorable gentleman friom Massachusetts, after deliberating a

of that gentleman, selects me as his adversary, and pours out all the
vials of his mighty wrath upon my devoted head.  Nor is he willing
to stop there.  He goes on to assail the institutions and policy of the
South, and calls in question the principles and conduct of the State
which I have the honor to represent.  When I find a gentleman of
mature age and experienlce, of acknowledged talents, and profound
sagcteity, pursuing a course like this, declining the contest offered from the
West, and mnaking war upon the unoffending South, I must believe
I am bound to believe - he has some object in view which he has not
ventured to disclose.  Mr. President, why is this?  Has the gentlenman discovered, in former controversies with the gentleman from Missouri, that he is over-matched by that Senator?  And does he hope
for tn easy victory over a ni more feeble adversary? Has the gentleman's distempered fancy been disturbed by gloomy forebodings of
1" new alliances to be formied," at which he hinted?  Ilas the ghost
of the murdered Coalition come back, like the ghost of Banquo, to
" sear the eye-balls of the gentleman," and will it not " down at his
tidding"?   Are dark visions of broken hopes, and honors lost fortvei, still floatiirg before his lheated imagination?  Sir, if it be his
sbject to thrust me between the gentlemnan fiom MIissouri and himself,

victory, let him wear the honors. I shall not deprive him of his.aurels.
190. THE SOUTH D)URlING THE REVOLUTION. -Hayne, 183'0o
IF there be one State in the Union, Mr. President (and I say it
not in a boastfiLl spirit), that may challenge comparisons with any
other, for an uniformn, zealous, ardent, and uncalculating devotion to
the Union, that State is South Carolina. Sir, from the very comlmencement of the Revolution, up to this hour, there is no sacrifice,
however great, she has not cheerfully made,- no service she has ever
Ihesitated to perform.  She has adhered to you in your prosperity;
t-ut in your adversity shle has clung to you with more than filial affection.  No matter what was the condition of her domestic affairs, -
though deprived of her resources, divided by parties, or surrounded
with difficulties, - the call of the country has been to her as the voice
of God. Domestic discord ceased at the sound; every man became
at once reconciled to his brethren. and the sons of Carolina were all
seen crowding together to the temple, bringing their gifts to the altar
of their common country.
What, Sir, was the conduct of the South during the Revolution?
Sir, I honor New England for her conduct in that glorious struggle.
But, great as is the praise which belongs to her, I think at least equal
honor is due to the South. They espoused the quarrel of their
brethren, with a generous zeal, which did not suffer them  to stop to
calculate their interest in the dispute.  Favorites of the motlher
country, possessed of neither ships nor seamen to create a commercial
rivalship, they might have found in their situation a guarantee that
their trade would be forever fostered and protected by Great Britain.
But, trampling on all considerations either of interest or of safety
they rushed into the conflict, and, fighting for principle, perilled all, is
the sacred cause of freedom.  Never was there exhibited, in the his.
tory of the world, higher examples of noble daring, dreadful suffering
and heroic endurance, than by the Whigs of Carolina, during the
Revolution. The whole State, from  the mountains to the sea, wad
overrun by an overwhelming force of enemy.  The fruits of industry
perished on the spot where they were produced, or were consumed by
the foe. The " plains of Carolina" drank up the most precious blood
of her citizens.  Black and smoking ruins marked the places which
had been the habitations of her children! Driven from their homes,
into the gloomy and almost impenetrable swamps, even there the
spirit of liberty survived; and South Carolina, sustained by the
example of her Sumpters and her Marions, proved, by her conduct,
that, though her soil might be overrun, the spirit of lier People wag
tuvincibie.

191 THE SOUTH DURING THE WAR OF 1812.- IIayns 1630
i COMEf now to the war of 1812,-- a war which, I well remember,
was called, in derision (while its event was doubtful), the Southern
war, and sometimes the Carolina war; but which is now universally
acknowledged to have done more for the honor and prosperity of the
country than all other events in our history put together. What, Sir,
were the objects of that war?. "Free trade and sailors' rights!"  It
was for the protection of Northern shipping, and New England seamen. that the country flew to arms. What interest had the South in
that contest? If they had sat down coldly to calculate the value of
their interests involved in it, they would have found that they had
everything to lose, and nothing to gain. But, Sir, with that generous
devotion to country so characteristic of the South, they only asked if
the rights of any portion of their fellow-citizens had been invaded;
and when told that Northern ships and New England seamen had been
arrested on the common highway of Nations, they felt that the honor
of their country was assailed; and, acting on that exalted sentiment
" which feels a stain like a wound," they resolved to seek, in open war,
for a redress of those injuries which it did not become freemen to
en4ure. Sir, the whole South, animated as by a common impulse,
cordially united in declaring and promoting that war. South Carolina
sent to your councils, as the advocates and supporters of that war, the
noblest of her sons. How they fulfilled that trust, let a grateful
country tell. Not a measure was adopted, not a battle fought, not a
victory won, which contributed, in any degree, to the. success of that
war, to which Southern councils and Southern valor did not largely
contribute. Sir, since South Carolina is assailed, I must be suffered
to speak it to her praise, that, at the very moment when, in one
quarter, we heard it solemnly proclaimed " that it did Inot become a
religious antd moral People to rejoice at the victories of our Army or
our Navy," her Legislature unanimously
" Resolved, That we will cordially support the Government in tkh
vigorous prosecution of the war, until a peace can be obtained on honorable terms; and we will cheerfully submit to every privation that may
be required of us, by our Government, for the accomplishment of this
obj ect."
South Carolina redeemed that pledge. She threw open her Treasury to the Government. She put at the absolute disposal of the
)fficers of the United States all that she possessed, -her men, her
money, and her arms. She appropriated half a million of dollars, on
ner own account, in defence of her maritime frontier; ordered a brigade of State troops to be raised; and, when left to protect herself by
her own means, never suffered the enemy to touch her soil, without
heing instantly driven off or captured. Such, Sir, was the conduct of
the South - such the conduct of my own State - in that dark hour
"which tried men's souls!"

9'2 DEXALCATION AND RETRENCHMENT, 1838.-S. S. Prentiss. B. 1810; d. 18X5
SINCE the avowal. Mr. Chairman, of that unprincipled and barbarian
motto, that " to the victors belong the spoils," office, which was
rntended for the service and benefit of the People, has become but the.
plunder of party.  Patronage is waved like a huge magnet over the
laind; and demagogues, like iron-filings, attracted by a law of their
nature, gather and cluster around its poles. Never yet lived the
demagogue who would not take office. The whole frame of our Govcrnment - all the institutions of the country - are thus prostituted
to the uses of party. Office is conferred as the reward of partisan
service; and what is the consequence? The incumbents, being taught
that all moneys in their possession belong, not to thu People, but to
the party, it requires but small exertion of casuistry to bring them to
the conclusion that they have a right to retain what they may conceive
to be the value of their political services, --just as a la yer holds back
his commissions.
Sir, I have given you but three or four cases of defalcations.
Would time permit, I could give you a hundred. Like the fair
Sultana of the Oriental legends, I could go on for a thousand and
one nights; and even as in those Eastern stories, so hi the chronicles
of the office-holders, the tale would ever be of heaps of gold, massive
ingots, uncounted riches.  Why, Sir, Aladdin's wonderful lamp was
nothing to it. They seem to possess the identical cap of Fortunatus.
Some wish for fifty thousand dollars, some for a hundred thousand,
and some for a million, - and behold, it lies in glittering heaps before
them!   Not even
" The gorgeous East, with richest hand,
Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold"
in such lavish abundance, as does this Administration upon its followers. Pizarro held not forth more dazzling lures to his robber band,
when he led them to the conquest of the "Children of the Sun."
And now it is proposed to make up these losses through defaulters
by retrenchment! And what do you suppose are to be the subjects
of this new and sudden economy?    What branches of the public
service are to be lopped off, on account of the licentious rapacity of the
office-holders? I am too indignant to tell you. Look into the report
of the Secretary of the Treasury, and you will find out. Well, Sir.
what are they? Pensions, harbors, and light-houses! Yes, Sir; these
are recommended as proper subjects for retrenchment.  First of all
the scarred veterans of the Revolution are to be deprived of a portion of
the scanty pittance doled out to them by the cold charity of the country.
How many of them will you have to send forth as beggars on the very
soil which they wrenched from the hand of tyranny, to make up the
amount of even one of these splendid robberies? I-ow many harbors
will it take,- those improvements dedicated no less to humanity than
to interest,- those nests of conimerce to which the canvas-winged
bird. of the ocean flock for safety?  Hlow many light-houses will it

take? I-ow many of those bright eyes of the ocean are to be put
out?  How many of those faithful sentinels, who stand along our
rocky coast, and, peering far out in the darkness, give timely warning
o the hardy mariner where the lee-shore threatens, - how many of
these, I ask, are to be discharged from their humane service? aWhy,
the proposition is almost impious! I should as soon wish to put out the
stars of Heaven! Sir, my blood boils at the cold-blooded atrocity with
which the Administration proposes thus to sacrifice the very family
jewels of the country, to pay for the consequences of its own profligacy!
193. AMERICAN LABORERS.--C. C. Naylor.
THE Gentleman, Sir, has misconceived the spirit and tendency of
Northern institutions. He is ignorant of Northern character. He
hlas forgotten the history of his country.  Preach insurrection to the
Northern laborers! Who are the Northern laborers! The history
of your country is their history. The renown of your country is their
renown. The brightness of their doings is emblazoned on its every
page. Blot from your annals the words and the doings of Northern
laborers, and the history of your country presents but a universal
blank. Sir, who was he that disarmed the Thunderer; wrested from
his grasp the bolts of Jove; calmed the troubled ocean; became the
central sun of the philosophical system  of his age, shedding his
brightness and effulgence on the whole civilized world; whom the
great and mighty of the earth delighted to honor; who participated
In the achievement of your independence, prominently assisted in
moulding your free institutions, and the beneficial effects of whos4
wisdom will be felt to the last moment of " recorded time "?  Who,
Sir, I ask, was he? A Northern laborer, - a Yankee tallow-chandler's
son, - a printer's runaway boy!
And who, let me ask the honorable Gentleman, who was he that,
In the days of our Revolution, led forth a Northern army, --yes, an
army of Northern laborers, - and aided the chivalry of South Carolina
in their defence against British aggression, drove the spoilers from
their firesides, and redeemed her fair fields fi'om foreign invaders l
Who was he? A Northern laborer, a Rhode Island blacksmith, - the
gallant General Greene, --who left his hammer and his forge, and
went forth conquering and to conquer in the battle for our independence! And will you preach insurrection to men like these?
Sir, our country is full of the achievements of Northern laborers!
Where is Concord, and Lexington, and Princeton, and Trenton, and
Saratoga, and Bunker Hill, but in the North? And what, Sir, has
shed an imperishable renown on the never-dying names of those
hallowed spots, but the blood and the struggles, the high daring, and
patriotism, and sublime courage, of Northern laborers?  The whole
North is an everlasting monument of the freedom, virtue,;r.telligen'e,
and indomitable independence, of Northern lab)rers! Go, Sir, go
preach insurrection to men like these'
3434E STANDARD SPEAKER.
The fortitude of t.he men of the North, under intense suffering fE
liberty's sake, has been almost god-like! History has so recorded
it  Who comprised that gallant army, without food, without pay,

winter, - the midnight of our Revolution; - whose wanderings could
be traced by their blood-tracks in the snow; whom no arts could
seduce, no appeal lead astray, no sufferings disaffect; but who, true to
their country and its holy cause, continued to fight the good fight of
liberty, until it finally triumphed? Who, Sir, were these men?
lWhy, Northern laborers r- yes, Sir, Northein laborers! Who, Sir,
were Roger Sherman and -. But it is idle to enumerate. To

194. MERITS OF FULTON'S INVENTION, 1838. --Ogden hIoffman.
TiIrs House and the world have been told that Robert Fulton was
not the inventor of steam navigation.  England asserts that it is to a
Scotchman that the honor of this discovery is due, and that it was the
Clyde and the Thames that first witnessed the triumphant success of
this wonderful invention. France, through her National Institute,
declares that it was the Seine. Even Spain, degraded and enslaved,
roused by the voice of emulation, has looked forth from her cloistered
halls of superstition, and declared that in the age of Charles, in the
presence of her Court aild nobles, this experiment was successfully
tried. But America, proudly seated upon the enduring nionument
which Fulton has reared, smiles at these rival claims, and, secure in
her own, looks down serenely upon these billows of strife, which break
at the base of her throne.
But it has been denied, in this debate, that any other credit than
that of good luck is due to Fulton for his invention. Gentlemen would
have us suppose that good luck is the parent of all that we admire in
science or in arms. If this be so, why, then, indeed, what a btubble is
reputation! How vain and how idle are the anxious days and sleepless
nights devoted to the service of one's country! Admit this argument
and you strip from the brow of the scholar his bay, and from those of
the statesman and soldier their laurel. Why do you deck with chaplets
the statue of the Father of his Country, if good luck, and good luck
alone, be all that commends him to our gratitude and love? A nmemn
ber of this House retorts, " Bad luck would have made Washington a
traitor."  Ay, but in whose estimation?  Did the great and holy
principles which produced and governed our Revolution depend, for
their righteousness and truth, upon success or defeat?.Would Washington, had he suffered as a rebel on the scaffold, - would Washington
have been regarded as a traitor by Warren, and Hancock, and GCreene

ners of his toil and sharers of his patriotism? WVas it good luck that
impelled Columbus, through discouragement, conspiracy and poverty,
to persevere in his path of danger, until this Western world blessed his
sight, and rewarded his energy and daring?  Does the gentleman
emulate the glory of the third King of Rome, Tullus Hostilius, - and
would he erect in our own land a temple to Fortune? It cannot be
that -he would seriously promulgate such views; - that he would take
from human renown all that gives it dignity and worth, by making it
depend less on the virtue of the individual than on his luck!
195. SECTIONAL SERVICES IN TIlE LAST WAR.--Caleb Cushing.
THE gentleman from South Carolina taunts us with counting the
costs of that war in which the liberties and honor of the country, and
the interests of the North, as he asserts, were forced to go elsewhere
for their defence. Will he sit down with me and count the cost now?
Will he reckon up how much of treasure the State of South Carolina
expended in that war, and how mluch the State of Massachusetts? -
how much of the blood of either State was poured out on sea or land?
I challenge the gentleman to the test of patriotism, which the army
roll, the navy lists, and the treasury books, afford. Sir, they who
revile us for our opposition to the last war have looked only to the
surface of things.  They little know the extremities of suffering
which the People of Massachusetts bore at that period, out of attachment to the Union,--their families beggared, their fathers and sons
bleeding in camps, or pining in foreign prisons. They forget that not
a field was marshalled, on this side of the mountains, in which the men
of Massachusetts did not play their part, as became their sires, and
their "blood fetched from mettle of war proof."  They battled and
bled, wherever battle was fought or blood drawn.
Nor only by land. I ask the gentleman, Who fought your naval
battles in the last war? Who led you on to victory after victory, on
the ocean and the lakes? Whose was the triumphant prowess before
which the Red Cross of England paled with unwonted shames? Were
they not men of New England?  Were these not foremost in those
maritime encounters which humnbled the pride and' power of Great
Britain? I appeal to my colleague before me from our commnon county
of brave old Essex,--I appeal to my respected colleagues from the
shores of the Old Colony. Was there a village or a hamlet on Massa.
chusetts Bay, which did not gather its hardy seamen to man the gundecks of your ships of war? Did they not rally to the battle, as men
flock t-o a feast?
I beseech the HIouse to pardon me, if I may have kindled, on this
subject, into something of unseemly ardor. I cannot sit tamely by, in
numble acquiescent silence, when reflections, which I know to be
unjust, are cast on the faith and honor of Massachusetts. Had I suffered them to pass without admonition, I should have deemed that the
disembodied spirits of her departed children, from their ashes mingles

maidens nowhere lovelier, green valleys and bright rivers nowhere
greener or brighter; and I will not be silent, when I hear her patriot.

196. BARBARITY OF NATIONAL HATREDS.--Riufus Choate.
MR. PRrESIDENT, we must distinguish a little.  That there exists in
this country an intense sentiment of nationality; a cherished energetic
feeling arind consciousness of our independent and separate national
existence; a feeling that we have a transcendent destiny to fulfil, which
we mean to fulfil; a great work to do, which we know how to do, and
are able to do; a career to run, up which we hope to ascend, till we
stand oil the steadfast and glittering summits of the world; a feeling,
that we are surrounded and attended by a noble historical group of
competitors and rivals, the other Nations of the earth, all of whom we
hope to overtake, and even to distance; - such a sentiment as this
exists, perhaps, in the character of this People. And this I do not discourage, I do not condemn. But, Sir, that among these useful and
beautiful sentiments, predominant among them, there exists a temper
of hostility towards this one particular Nation, to such a degree as to
amount to a habit, a trait, a national passion, - to amount to a state
of feeling which " is to be regretted," and which really threatens another
war,- this I earnestly and confidently deny.  I would not hear your
enemy say this. Sir, the indulgence of such a sentiment by the People
supposes them to have forgotten one of the counsels of Washington.
Call to mind tlle ever seasonable wisdom of the Farewell Address:
" The Nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or
an habitual fondness, is, in some degree, a slave. It is a slave to its
animosity, or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it
astray from its duty and its interest."
No, Sir! no, Sir! We are above all this. Let the Highland clansman, half naked, half civilized, half blinded by the peat-smoke of his
cavern, have his hereditary enemy and his hereditary enmity, and
keep the keen, deep, and precious hatred, set on fire of hell, alive, if he
can; let the North American Indian have his, and hand it down from
father to son, by Iecaven knows what symbols of alligators, and rattlesnakes, and war-clubs smeared with vermilion and entwined with
scarlet; let such a country as Poland, - cloven to the earth, the

all that had been settled. I thought two wars had settled it all. What
else was so much good blood shed for, on so many more than classical
fields of Revolutionary glory? For what was so much good blood molre
lately shed, at Lundy's Lane, at Fort Erie, before and behind the lines
at New Orleans, on the deck of the Constitution, on the deck' of the
Java, on the lakes, on the sea, but to settle exactly these " wrongs of
past days"? And have we jome back sulky and sullen from the very
field of honor? For my country, I deny it.
Mr. President, let me say that, in my judgment, this notion of a
national enmity of feeling towards Great Britain belongs to a past age
of our history. My younger countrymen are unconscious of it. They
disavow it. That generation in whose opinions and feelings the actions
and the destiny of the next are unfolded, as the tree in the germ,
do not at all comprehend your meaning, nor your fears, nor your
regrets. We are born to happier feelings. We look to England as
we look to France. We look to theml, from our new world, - not
unrenowned, yet a new world still,--and the blood mounts to our
cheeks; our eyes swim; our voices are stifled with emulousness of sc
much glory; their trophies will not let us sleep: but there is no
hatred at all; no hatred, - no barbarian memory of wrongs, for which
brave men have made the last expiation to the brave.
197. ON PRECEDENTS IN GOVERNMENT, 1851.--Lewis Cass.
MR. PRESIDENT, eloquent allusions have been made here to the
ominous condition of Europe. And, truly, it is sufficiently threatening to fix the regard of the rest of the civilized world. Elements are
at work there whose contact and contest must, ere long, produce
explosions whose consequences no man can foresee. The cloud may
as yet be no bigger than a man's hand, like that seen by the prophet
from Mount Carniel; but it will overspread the whole hemisphere, and
burst, perhaps in ruins, upon the social and political systems of the
Old World. Antagonistic principles are doing their work there. The
conflict cannot be avoided. The desire of man to govern himself, and
the determination of rulers to govern him, are now face to face, and
must meet in the strife of action, as they have met in the strife of
opinion. It requires a wiser or a rasher man than I am to undertake
to foretell when and how this great battle will be fougbt; but it is as,

in anger. They are cast on vacancy, in thought. They are thrown in different
directiqns, in doubt and anxiety.
The A.rms. The arm is projected forward, in authority. Both arms are

cyFcs, shame. On the lips, injunction of silence. On the breast, it appeals to
(ouscience, or intimates desire. The hand waves, or flourishes, in joy, or con
tempt. Both hands are held supine, or clasped, in prayer. Both descend
prone, in blessing. They are clasped, or wrung, in affliction. The outstretched
hands, with the knuckles opposite the speaker's face, express fear, abhorreqce,
rejection, or dismissal. The outstretched hands, with the palms toward the face
of the speaker, denote approval, acceptation, welcoming, and love.
The Body. The body, held erect, indicates steadiness and courage. Thrown

Walker says that we should be careful to let the stroke of the hand which
mnarks force, or emphasis, keep exact time with the force of pronunciation
that is, the hand must go down upon the emphatic word, and no other
Thus, in the imprecation of Brutus, in Julius Ctesar:
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
Be ready, Gods, with all your thunderbolts,
Dsash him in pieces!
Here, says Walker, the action of the arm which enforces the emphasis ought
to be so directed that the stroke of the hand may be given exactly on the
word dash; this will give a concomitant action to the organs of pronunciation,
and by this means the whole expression will be greatly augmented.
Archbishop Whately'contends, on the contrary, that the natural order of
action is, that the gesture should precede the utterance of the words.  " An
amotion, struggling for utterance, produces a tendency to a bodily gesture, to
express that emotion more quickly than words can be framed; the words fol
low as soon as they can be spoken. And this being always the case with a real,
earnest, unstudied speaker, this mode, of placing the action foremost, gives
(if it be otherwise appropriate) the appearance of earnest emotion actually
present in the mind. And the reverse of this natural order would alone be
smfficient to convert the action of Demosthenes himself into unsuccessful and
ridiculous mimicry."
Where two such authorities clash, the pupil's own good taste must give the
t ho his decision.
ATTITUDE.
* fhe gracefulness of motion in the human frame," says Austin, in his
Chiroromia, "consists in the facility and security with which it is executed;
md the grace of any position consists in the facility with which it can be
varied. Hence, in the standing figure, the position is graceful when the
weight of the body is principally supported on one leg, while the other is so
placed as to be ready to relieve it promptly, and without effort. The foot which
sustains the principal weight must be so placed that a perpend(licular line, let

sure to come as is the sun to rise again which is now descending to the
horizon. WVhat the free Governments of the world may find it proper
to do, when this great struggle truly begins, I leave to those upon
whom will devolve the duty and the responsibility of decision.
It has been well said that the existing generation stands upon the
shoulders of its predecessors.  Its visual horizon is enlarged from'his
elevation. We have the experience of those who have gone before us,
and our own, too. We are able to judge for ourselves, without bliitdly
bfllowing in their footsteps. There is nothing stationary in the world.
Moral and intellectual as well as physical sciences are in a state of
progress; or, rather, we are marching onwards in the investigation of
their true principles. It is presumptuous, at any time, to say that
"Now is the best possible condition of human nature; let us sit still
anld be satisfied; there is nothing more to learn." I believe in no such
(loctrine.  I believe we are always learning.  We have a right to
examine for ourselves.  In fact, it is our duty to do so. Still, Sir, I
would not rashly reject the experience of the world, any more than I
would blindly follow it. I have no such idea. I have no wish to
prostrate all the barriers raised by wisdom, and to let in upon us an
inundation of many such opinions as have been promulgated in the
presert age. But far be it frol inme to adopt, as a principle of conduct, that nothing is to be done except what has been done before, and
precisely as it was then done. So much for precedents!
198. INTERVENTION IN TIIE WARS OF EUROPE, 1852.--Jeremiah Clemens.
WAShINGTON has said: "There can be no greater error than to
expect or calculate upon any real favors from nation to nation.  It is
an illusion which experience must cure, and which a just pride ought
to discard."  There is a deep wisdom in this; and he who disregards,
or treats it lightly, wants the highest attribute of a statesman.  We
can expect nothing as a fzivor from other nations, and none have a
right to expect favors from us. Our interference, if we interfere at
all, must be dictated by interest; and, therefore, I ask, in what possible mlanIner can we be benefited?  Russia has done us no injury:
we, lh:ve, therefore, no wrongs to avenge.  Russia has no territory of
which wv v:i.h to deprive her, and from her there is no danger against
which it is necessary to guard.  Enlightened self-interest does not
vffer a single argument in favor of embroiling ourselves in a quarrel
-'itli her. So obvious, so indisputable, is this truth, that the advocates
of "intervention" have based their speeches almost solely on the
around that we have a divine mission to perform, and that is, to strike
the manacles from the hands of all mankind.  It may be, Mr. President, that we have such a mission; but, if so, " the time of its fulfil.
ment is not yet." And, for one, I prefer waiting -for some clearer
manifestation of the Divine will. By attempting to fulfil it now, we
employ the surest means of disappointing that " manifest destiny " offiM I'ORIAL. -W. R. MR.  ITth.
which we have heard so much. We have before us the certainty of
inflicting deep injury upon ourselves, without the slightest prospect of
oenefiting others.
Misfortunes may come upon us all; dishonor attaches only to the
unworthy. A nation may be conquered, trodden down, - her living
sons in chains, her dead the prey of vultures, -and still leave a
bright example, a glorious history, to after timnes. But when folly and
wickedness have ruled the hour,- when disaster is the legitimate child
of error and weakness,- the page that records it is but a record of
infamy, and pity for misfbrtune becomes a crime against justice.  Sir
I do not love that word " destiny,"-  6 manifest " or not " manifest.'
3Men and nations make their own destinies, -
"Our acts our angels are, or good, or ill,
Our fatal shadows, that walk by us still."
The future of this Republic is in our hands; and it is fbr us t6
determine whether we will launch the ship of State upon a wild and
stormy sea, above whose blackened waters no sunshine beams, no star
shines out, and where not a ray is seen but what is caught from the
lurid lightning in its fiery path. This, Senators, is the mighty ques.
tion we have to solve; and, let me add, if the freedom of one conti
nent, and the hopes of four, shall sink beneath that inky flood, ours
will be the guilt, - ours the deep damnation.
Shall I be told these are idle fears? That, in a war with Russia,
Ino matter for what cause waged, we must be the victors?  That, in
short, all Europe combined could not blot this Union fiom the map of
nations? A.h, Sir, that is not all I fear. I fear success even more:
than defeat. The Senator from Michigan was right when he said that
our fears were to be found at home. I do fear ourselves.  Commlit
our people once to unnecessary foreign wars, - let victory encourage
the military spirit, already too prevalent among them, - and Roman
h]istory will have no chapter bloody enough to be transmnitted to
posterity side by side with ours.  In a brief period we shlall have
re/6nacted, on a grander scale, the same scenes which marked her
decline. The veteran soldier, who has followed a victorious leader fi'ola
clime to clime, will forget his love of country in his love for his commander; and the bayonets you send abroad to conquer a kingdom will
be brought back to destroy the rights of the citizen, and prop the
throne of an Emperor.

now over thirty.  But Kossuth says that we may depart fiom that
policy now; that it was wise when we were young, but that now we
havP grown up to be a giant, and may abandon it. Alh, Sir, we can
all resist adversity! We know the uses - and sweet are they - of
adversity. It is the crucible of fortune. It is the iron key that
unlocks the golden gates of prosperity. I say, God bless adversity,
when it is properly understood! But the rock upon which men and
upon which Nations split is PRosPERITY.  This man says that we have
grown to be a giant, and that we may depart from the wisdom of our
youth. But I say that now is the time to take care; we are greab
enough; let us be satisfied; prevent the growth of our ambition, to
prevent our pride from swelling, and hold on to what we have got.
Do you remember the story of the old Governor, who had been
raised from rags? HIis King discovered in him merit and integrity,
and appointed him a Satrap, a ruler over many provinces. He came
to be great, and it was his custom to be escorted throughout the country several times during the year, in order to see and be seen. He
was received and acknowledged everywhere as a great man and a great
Governor.  But he carried about with him a mysterious chest, and
every now and then he would look into it, and let nobody else see
what it contained. There was a great deal of curiosity excited by
this chest; and finally he was prevailed upon, by some of his friends, to
let them look into it. Well, he permitted it, and what did they see?
They saw an old, ragged an(d torn suit of clothes, - the clothes that
he used to wear in his humility and in his poverty; and he said that
he carried them about with him in order that, when his heart began to
swell, and his ambition to rise, and his pride to dilate, he could look on
thle rags that reminded him of what he had been, and thereby be
enabled to resist the temptations of prosperity. Let us see whether
this can illustrate anything in our history. Raise the veil, if there i,
one, which conceals the poverty of this Union, when there were but
thirteen States! Raise the veil that conceals the rags of our soldiers
of the Revolution! Lift the lid of the chest which contains the poverty of our beginning, in order that you may be reminded, like this
old Satrap, of the days of your poverty, and be enabled to resist the
advice of this man, who tells you that you were wise in your youth,
but that now you are a giant, and may depart from that wisdomi
Remember the use of adversity, and let us take advantage of it,
and be benefited by it; for great is the man, and greater is the Nation,
that can resist the enchanting smiles of prosperity!

has always been ready to serve her; he always h2as served her faithfully and effectually.  He ohas often been weighed in the balance, and
never found wanting.  The only fault ever found with him is, that he
sometimes fights ahead of his orders.  The world has no match for'him, man for nlan; and lie asks no odds, and he cares fir no odds,'when the cause of humanity, or the glory of his country, calls him to
fight.  Who, in the darkest days of our Revolution, carried your flag
into the very chops of the British Channel, bearded the lion in his
deni, and woke the echoes of old Albion's hills by the thunlders of his
cannon, and the shouts of his triumph?  It was the American sailor.
And the names of John Paul Jones, and the Ben Hominae R1ichard,
will go down the annals of time forever.  Who struck the first blow
that humbled the Barbary flag,-- which, for t hlundred years, had been'
the terror of Christendom,- drove it finom the M1lediterranean, and put
an end to the infamrous tribute it had been accustomed to extort?  It
was the American sailor.  And the name of Decatur and his gallant
companions will be as lasting as monumental brass.  In your war of
1812, when your arms on shore were covered by disaster, - when
Winchester had been defeated, when the Armiy of the North-west
had surrendered, and when the gloom of despondellcy hung like a clcudo
over the land, - who first relit the fires of national glory, and made thl
welkin ring with the shlouts of victory?  It was the American sailor.
And the names of Hull and the Constitution will be remembered, as
long as we have left anything worth remembering.  That was no sminll
event.  The wand of Mexican prowess was broken on the Rio Grande.
Thle wand of British invincibility was broken when the flag of the

lie than all the money which has ever been expended for the Navy.
Since that day, the Navy has aad no stain upon its escutcheon, but
has been cherished as your pride and glory. And the American sailor
has established a reputation throughout the world, - in peace and in
war, in storm and in battle, - for heroism and prowess unsurpassed.
He shrinks from no danger, he dreads rio foe, and yields to no superior. No shoals are too dangerous, no seas too boisterous, no climate

energies. Fjoster, cherish, develop these characteristics, by a generous and paternal government. Excite his emulation, and stimulate
his ambition, by rewards.  But, above all, save him, save him from
the brutalizing lash, and inspire him with love and confidence for your
service! and then there is no achievement so arduous, no confliet so
desperate, in which his actions will not:shed glory upon his country.
And, when the final struggle comes, as soon it will come, for the empire of the seas, you may rest with entire confidence in the persuasion
that victory will be yours.
201. ON GOYERNMENT EXTRAVAGANCG, 1638. -John J. Crittenden.
THE bill under consideration is intended to authorize the Treasury
Department to issue ten millions of Treasury Notes, to be applied to
the discharge of the expenses of Government. Habits of extravagance,
it seems, are hard to change. They constitute a disease; ay, Sir, a
very dangerous one. That of the present Administration came to a
crisis about eight months ago, and it cost the patient ten millions of
Treasury Notes to get round the corner. And now it is as bad as
ever! Another crisis has come, and the doctors ask for ten millions
more. The disease is desperate. Money or death! They say, if the
bill is rejected, Governmnent must " stop."  What must stop?  The
laws? The judicial tribunals? The Legislative bodies? The institutions of the country? No, no, Sir! all these will remain, and go
on. What stops, then? Its own extravagance,  that must stop, and
"there's the rub!"  Besides, Sir, I must really be permitted to say,
that, if to keep this Administration on its feet is to cost ten millions
of extraordinary supply, every six or eight months, why, Mr. President, the sooner its fate is recorded in the bills of mortality, the better.
Let me know how this money is to be applied. I never will vote a
collar on the mere cry of" I exigency! "-" crisis!" I will be behind
no man in meeting the real necessities of my country, but I will not
blindly, or heedlessly, vote away the money of the People, or involve
them in debt.  If the Government wants rmoney, let it borrow it. If
extravagance or necessity shall bring a national debt upon us, let it
come openly, and not steal upon us in the disguise of Treasury Notes.'! but it is no debt," say gentlemen; "it is only issuing a fbw
notes, to meet a crisis."  Well, Sir, whether it be a national debt, I
will not say. This I know, it will be fobllowed, whatever it is, with
the serious and substantial consequence, that the people of the United
States will have to pay it, every cent of it, and with interest.  Sir, I
desire to see this experimenting Administration forced to make some
experiments in economy. It is alinost the only sort of experiment to
which.it seems averse. Its cry is still for money, money, money!
But, for one, I say to it, " Take physic, Pomp! "  Lay aside your
extravagance. Too much money has been your bane. And I do not
feel myself required, by any duty, to grant you more, at present..  If

1. THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS, 1794. - John Philpot Curran.
WHiAT, then, remains-? The liberty of the Press, only,-- that sacred
palladium, which no influence, no power, no minister, no Government,
which nothing but the depravity or folly or corruption of a jury, can
ever destroy. And what calamities are the People saved from, by
having public communication left open to them?  I will tell you,
Gentlemen, what they are saved from, and what the Government is
saved from; I will tell you, also, to what both are exposed, by shutting up that communication. In one case, sedition speaks aloud, and
walks abroad; the demagogue goes forth, -the public eye is upon
him, - he frets his busy hour upon the stage; but soon either weariness, or bribe, or punishment, or disappointment, bears him down, or
drives him off, and he appears no more. In the other case, how does
the work of sedition go forward?  Night after night, the muffled
rebel steals forth in the dark, and casts another and another brand
upon the pile, to which, when the hour of fatal maturity shall arrive
he will apply the torch.
In that awful moment of a Nation's travail, of the last gasp of
-tyranny, and the first breath of freedom, how pregnant is the example!
The Press extinguished, the People enslaved, and the Prince undone!:
As the advocate of society, therefore, of peace, of domestic liberty,
and the lasting union of the two countries, I conjure you to guard the
liberty of the Press, that great sentinel of the State, that grand detector of public imposture! Guard it, because, when it sinks, there sinks
with it, in ohe common grave, the liberty of the subject, and the security of the Crown!
2. DESCRIPTION OF MR. ROWAN, 1794.--John Philpot Curran.
G &amp;NTLEMEN, if you still have any doubt as to the guilt or innocence
of the defendant, give me leave to suggest to you what circumstances
you ought to consider, in.order to found your verdict. You should
consider the character of the person accused; and in this your task is
easy. I will venture to say there is not a man in this Nation more
known than the gentleman who is the subject of this prosecution; not
only by the part he has taken in public concerns, and which he has
taken in common with many, but still more so by that extraordinary
sympathy for husman affliction, which, I anm sorry to think, he shares
23THE STANDARD SPEAKElR.
with so small a number.  There is not a day that you hear the cries
of your starxing manufacturers in your streets, that you do not also
see the advocate of their sufferings, - that you do not see his honest
and manly figure, with uncovered head, soliciting for their relief,searching the frozen heart of charity for every string that can be
touched by compassion, and urging the force of every argument, and
every motive, save that which his mnodesty suppresses, the authority
of his own generous example.
Or, if you see him not there, you may trace his steps to the private
abodes of' disease, and famine, and despair, --the messenger of Heaven,
bringing with him food, and medicine, and consolation. Are these the
materials of which you suppose anarchy and public rapine to be formed?
Is this the man on whom to fasten the abominable charge of goading
on a frantic populace to mutiny and bloodshed?  Is this the. man
likely to apostatize ftom every principle that can bind him to the
State, - his birth, his property, his education, his character, and his
children? Let me tell you, gentlemen of the jury, if you agree with
his prosecutors, in thinking that there ought to be a sacrifice of such a
mall onl such an occasion, and upon the credit of such evidence you are
to convict him, never did you, never can you give a sentence, consigning any man to public punishment, with less danger to his person or
to his famne; for where, to flilg crntumely or ingratitude at his head,
could the hireling be found, whose )rivate distresses he had not endeavored to alleviate, or whose public condition he had not labored to
improve?
I will not relinquish the confidence that this day will be the period
of my client's sufferings; and that, however mercilessly he has been
hitherto pursued, your verdict will send him home to the arms of his
fimily, and the wishes of his country. But if (which Heaven forbid!)
it hath still been unfortunately determined, that, because he has not
bent to power and authority, --because he would not bow down before
the golden calf, and worship it, - he is to be bound and cast into the
furnace, I do trust in God that there is a redeeming spirit in the
Constitution, which will be seen to walk with the sufferer through the
flames, and to preserve him unhurt by the conflagration!
THE HABEAS CORPUS ACT. -John Philpot Curran, in the case of the King
against 3Mr. Justice Johnson, Feb. 4th, 1805, before Chief Baron Lord Avonmore and
the other Barons, in the Court of Exchequer.
I Now address you on a question the most vitally connected with
ih, liberty and well-being of every man within the limits of the British
alpire; - which being decided one way, he may be a freeman; which
Leing decided the other, lie must be a slave.  I refer to the mnainten~'ncec of that sacred security for the freedom of Englishmen,- so justly
call6d the second Magna Charta of British liberty,--the Habeas Corpus Act; the spirit and letter of which is, that the party arrested shall
without a moment's delay, be ba,iled, if the offence be bailable. What
854FORENSIC AND JUDICIAL. - CURRAN.                  5fi5
was the occasion of the law? The arbitrary transportation 3f the subject beyond the realm; the base and malignant war which the odious
and despicable minions of power are forever ready to wage against all
those who are honest.and bold enough to despise, to expose, and to
resist them.
Such is the oscitancy of man, that he lies torpid for ages under these
aggressions, until, at last, some signal abuse - the violation of LucreGe,
the death of Virginia, the oppression of TWilliam Tell --shakes him
frorn his slumber.  For. years had those drunken gambols of power
been played in England; for years had the waters of bitterness beeI
rising to the brim; at last, a single drop caused them to overflow, -
the oppression of a single individual raised the people of England fromn
their sleep. And what does that great statute do. It defines and
asserits the right, it points out the abuse; and it endeavors to secure the
right. and to guard against the abuse, by giving redress to the sufferer,
and by punishing the offender.  For years had it been the practice to
transport obnoxious persons out of the realm into distant parts, under
the pretext of punishment, or of safe custody.  Well might they have
been said, to be sent "to that undiscovered country from whose bourn
no traveller returns;" for of these wretched travellers how few ever
did return!
But of that flagrant abuse this statute has laid the axe to the root.
It prohibits the abuse; it declares such detention or removal illegal;
it gives an action against all persons concerned in the offence, by contriving, writing, signing, countersigning, such warrant, or advising or
assisting therein. Are bulwarks like these ever constructed to repel
the incursions of a contemptible enemy?  Was it a trivial and ordinary occasion which raised this storm of indignation in the Parliament
of that day?  Is the ocean ever lashed by the tempest, to waft a
feather, or to drown a fly? By this act you have a solemn legislative
declaration, "that it is incompatible with liberty to send any subject
out of the realm, under pretence of any crime supposed or alleged to
be committed in a foreign jurisdiction, except that crime be capital."
Such were the bulwarks which our ancestors placed about the sacred
temple of liberty, such the ramparts by which they sought to bar out
the ever-toiling ocean of arbitrary power; and thought (generous credulity!) that they had barred it out from  their posterity forever,
Little did they foresee the future race of vermin that would work
their way through those mounds, and let back the inundation!
4. CUIRRAN'S APPEAL TO LORD AVONMORE. -From the last- n.med speech.
I AM not ignorant, my Lords, that the iextraordinary construction
of law against which I contend has received the sanction of another
sourt, nor of the surprise and dismay with which it smote upon tho,
general heart of the bar.  I am aware that I mnay have the mortification of being told, in another country, of thcat unhappy decision; and ITHE STANDARD SrEAKER.
foresee in what confusion I shall hang lown my head wnen I am
told it.
But I cherish, too, the consolatory hope, that I shall be able to tell
them that I had an old and learned friend, whom I would put above
all the sweepings of their hall, who was of a different opinion; who had
derived his ideas of civil liberty from the purest fountains of Athens
and of Rome; who had fed the youthful vigor of his studious mind
with the theoretic knowledge of their wisest philosophers and statesmen; and who had refined that theory into the quick and exquisite
sensibility of moral instinct, by contemplating the practice of their
most illustrious examples, - by dwelling on the sweet-souled piety of
Dimon, on the anticipated Christianity of Socrates, on the gallant
and pathetic patriotism  of Epaminondas, on that pure austerity of
Fabricius, whom to move from his integrity would have been more
difficult than to have pushed the sun fiom his course.
I would add, that, if he had seemed to hesitate, it was but for a
moment; that his hesitation was like the passing cloud that floats
across the morning sun, and hides it from the view, and does so for a
moment hide it, by involving the spectator, witlout even approaching
the face of the luminary. And this soothing hope I draw from the
dearest and tenderest recollections of my life; from the remembrance
of those attic nights and those refections of the gods which we have
partaken with those admired, and respected, and beloved companions,
who have gone before us, - over whose ashes the most precious tears
of Ireland have been shed.*
Yes, my good lord, I see you do not forget them; I see their sacred
forms passing in sad review before your memory; I see your pained
and softened fancy recalling those happy meetings, where the innocent
enjoyment of social mirth became expanded into the nobler warmth of
social virtue, and the horizon of the board became enlarged into the
horizon of man; where the swelling heart conceived and communicated
the pure and generous purpose; where my slenderer and younger taper
imbibed its borrowed light from the more matured and redundant fountain of yours. Yes, my lord, we: can remember those nights, without
any other regret than that they can never more return; for,
"We spent them not in toys, or lust, or wine;
But search of deep philosophy,
Wit, eloquence, and poesy;
Arts which I loved, for they, my friend, were thine."
H Iere, according to the original report, Lord Avonmore could not refrain from
bursting into tears. In the midst of Curran's legal argument, " this most beautiful
episode," says Charles Phillips, "bloomed like a green spot amid the desert. Mr
Curran told me hiinself, that when the court rose, the tip-staff informed him he was
wanrted immediately in chamber by one of the judges of the Exchequer. IHe, of
course, obeyed the jutdicial mandate; and the moment he entered, poor Lord Avonmnore, whose cheeks were still wet with the tears extorted by this heart-touching
appeal, clasped him to his bosoim " A coolness caused by political difference,
which had for some time existed between them, gave place to a renewal of friendship, which wa not again interrupted

&amp; ON BEING FOUND GUILTY OF HIGIH TRIEASON.-Robert Emmett
On the 23d of June, 1803, a rebellion against the Government broke out in Dublin, in which
Robert Ermmett, at the time only twenty-three years of age, was a prilciepal acto)r. It proved,
a failure. Emmett was arrested, having missed the opportunity of escape, it is said, by linger
lng to take leave of a daughter of Curran, the gifted orator, to whom he bore an attachment,
w;ich was reciprocated. On the 19th of September, 1803, Emmett was tried for high treason
at the Sessions House, Dublin, before Lord Norbury, one of the Chief Judges of the King's
Bene.), ancd- others; 5was found guilty, anld executed the next day. Through his counsel, he had
asked(, at the trial, that the judgment of the Court might be postponed until the next morIing.
This request was not granted. The clerk of the Crown read the indictmelnt, and annoulcece
the verdict found, in the usual form. Ile then concluded thus: "' What have you, therlefore.
now to say, why judgment of deatlh and execution should not be awvarded agaiinst you, accord
ing to law?" Standing forward in the deock, in fronit of the Bench, Emmlnett made tile following
impromptu address, which we give eintire, dividing it olnly into passages of a suitable length for
declamiation. At his execution, Emmnett displayed great fortitude. As he was passiing out of
his cell, on his way to the gallows, he met the turnkey, who had become much attached to him.
Being fettered, Emmett could not give his hand; so he kissed the poor fellow on tho cheek.

I.
WIAT l have I to say, why sentence of death         should  not be pronounced on mine, according to law? I have nothing to say which can
alter your predetermination, or that it would      become me to say with
any view to the mitigation of that sentence which         you are here to
pronounce, and which I, must abide. But I have that to say which
interests me more than life, and      which  you have labored-       as was
necessarily your office in the present circumstances of this oppressed
country -   to destroy.   I have aiuch to say, why mny reputation should
be rescued from   the load of false accusation    and  calumny which has
been heaped upon it.     I do not iniagine that, seated where you       are,
your minds can     be so free   from   impurity  as to receive the     least
impression fromn what I am     going to utter.     I have no hope that I
can  anchor my character in     the breast of a Court constituted       and
trammelled as this is. I only wish, and it is the utmost I expect,
that your Lordships     may suffer    it to float down    your   memories,
untainted by the foul breath     of prejudice, until it finds some more
hospitable harbor, to shelter it from the rude storm by which it is at
present buffeted.
Were I only to suffer death, after being adjudged gutilty by your
tribunal, r should bow in silence, and'meet the fate that awaits me,
without a murmur.      But the sentence of the law which       delivers nmy
body to the executioner will, through the ministry of that law, labor,
in its own vindication, to consign my character to obloquy: for there
miust be guilt somewhere,- -whether in the sentence of the Court, or
in the catastrophe, posterity must determine.         A  man in my situation,
my Lords, has not only to encounter the difficulties of fortune, and
the force of power over minds which      it has corrupted or subjugated.
but the difficulties of establishied prejudice: -the man (lies, but his
memory lives: that mine may not perish, that it           liay live in the

myself from   some of the    charges alleged    agailist rne.   When    my

the other fo(ot assists merely for the purpose of keeping the body balanced in
the position, and of preventing it from tottering. In the various positions of
the feet, care is to be taken that the grace which is aimed at be attended with
simplicity. The position of the orator is equally removed from the awkwardness of the rustic, with toes turned in and knees bent, and from the affectation
of the dancing-master, whose position runs to the opposite extreme. The
orator is to adopt such positions only as consist with manly and simple grace.
The toes are to be moderately turned outward, but not to be constrained; the
limbs are to be disposed so as to support the body with ease, and to admit of
flowing and graceful movement. The sustaining foot is to be planted firmly;
the leg braced, but not contracted; the other foot and limb must press lightly,
and be held relaxed, so as to be ready for immediate change and action. In
changing the positions of the feet, the motions are to be made with the utmost
simplicity, and free from the parade and sweep of dancing. The speaker must
advance, retire, or change, almost imperceptibly; and it is to be particularly
observed that changes should not be too frequent. Frequent change gives the
idea of anxiety or instability, both of which are unfavorable." Nothing can be
more unbecoming than for an orator to be constantly tripping from one side
to the other, on the stand, and walking so fast as to seem to outrun his speech.
Such an orator was said, anciently, to run after a cause, instead of pleading
it; and it is stated of Flavius Virginius, that he asked a speaker, very much
addicted to this habit, how many miles he had spoken that day. Of an orator,
whose favorite action was rising on tiptoe, it was said, that he must have been
accustomed to address his audience over a high wall.
The bow of the speaker to his audience, previous to his speech, should be
graceful and dignified; as far removed from a careless, jerking abruptness, as
from a formal and unnecessary flourish.
REGULATION OE THE HANDS, ARMS, &amp;C.
In Oratory, the regulation of the hand is of peculiar importance, not only as
it serves to express passion, but to mark the dependence of clauses, and to
interpret the emphasis. All action without the hand, says Quintilian, is weak
and crippled. The expressions of the hand are as varied as language. It
demands, promises, calls, dismisses, threatens, implores, detests, fears, questions, and denies, It expresses joy, sorrow, doubt, acknowledgment, depend-  
ence, repentance, number and time. Yet, the hand may be so employed as
not only to become an unmeaning, but an inconvenient appendage.  One
speaker may raise his hands so high that he cannot readily get them down.
One, cannot take them from his bosom. One, stretches them above his head;
and another lays about him with such vigor, that it is dangerous to be
within his reach.
In using the arms, a speaker should give his action in curves, and should
bear in mind that different situations call for more or less motion of the limbs.
The fingers of the hand should not be kept together, as if it were intended by
nature that they should unite; nor should they be held forth unmeaningly,
like a bunch of radishes; but they should be easily and naturally bent..
The speaker who truly feels his subject will feel it to his very finger-tips,
tiid these last will take unconsciously the right bend or motion. Study well,
therefore, what you have to say, and be prepared to say it in earnest.
The hand and arm should usually be moved gracefully in semi-circles,
mxsept in indicative passages, as thus:  I charm thy life!"  "Lord Cardi
nal, to yout I speak! "  To lay down rules as to how far the arms may be
extended, or to what elevation the hand may be raised, would be superfluous.
A speaker should avoid throwing his arms up, as if he were detbrmined to
fling them from him; and he should avoid letting them fall with a violence
sufficient to bruise his thigh; yet it is indispensable that the arm should fall
and that it shoull not remain pinioned to the side.THE STANI ARD SPEAKER.

animate those who survive me, while I look down with complacency
on the destruction of that perfidious G-overnment which upholds its
dominian by blasphemy of the Most High, --which displays its
power over man as over the beasts of the forest,- which sets man
uipon his brother, and lifts his hand, in the name of God, against the
throat of his fellow, who believes'or doubts a little more, or a little
less, than the Government standard, - a Governmeilt which is steeled
to barbarity by the cries of the orphans and the tears of the widows,
which it has made.*

I APPEAL to the immaculate God, - to the throne of Heaven, before
which I must shortly appear, - to the blood of the murdered patriots
who have gone before, -- that my conduct has been, through all this
peril, and through all my purposes, governed only by the convictions
which I have uttered, and by no other view than that of the emancipation of my country from the superinhuman oppression under which
she has so long and too patiently tr,a,vailed; and that I confidently and
assuredly hope that, wild and chimerical as it may appear, there is
still union and  strength in  Ireland  to  accomplish this noblest
enterprise.  Of this I speak with the confidence of intimate knowledge, and with the consolation that appertains to that confidence.
Think not, my Lords, I say this for the petty gratification of giving
you a transitory uneasiness; a man who never yet raised his voice to
assert a lie will not hazard his character with posterity by asserting
a falsehood on a subject so important to his country, and on an occasion like this.  Yes, my Lords; a man who does not wish to have his
epitaph written until his country is liberated will not leave a weapon
in the power of envy, nor a pretence to impeach the probity which
he means to preserve even in the grave to which tyranny consigns
him.t
Again I say, that what I have spoken was not intended for your
Lordships, whose situation I commiserate rather than envy; --my
expressions were for my countrymen; if there is a true Irishman
present, let my last words cheer him in the hour of his affliction- t
I have klways understood it to be the duty of a judge, wheni a
prisoner has been convicted, to pronounce the sentence of the law; I
have also understood that judges sometimes think it their duty to hear
with patience, and to speak with humanity; to exhort the victim of
the laws, and to offer, with tender benignity, opinions of the motives

by which he was actuated in the crime of which he had been
adjudged guilty. That a judge has thought it his duty so to have
done, I have no doubt; but where is the boasted freedom of your
institutions, - where is the vaunted impartiality, clemency, and mildness of your courts of justice,-- if an unfortunate prisoner, whom
your policy, and not justice, is about to deliver into the hands of the
executioner, is not suffered to explain his motives sincerely and truly,
ancl to vindicate the principles by which he was actuated?
III.
bIY LORDS, it may be a part of the system of angry justice to bow
a man's mind, by humiliation, to the purposed ignominy of the scaffold; but worse to me than the scaffold's shame, or the scaffold's
terrors, would be the shame of such foul and unfounded imputations
as have been laid against me in this Court. You, my Lord, are a
judge.  I am the supposed' culprit. I am a man, --you are a man
also.  By a revolution of power, we might change places, though we
never could change characters.  If I stand at the bar of this Court,
and dare not vindicate my character, what a farce is your justice! If
I stand at this bar, and dare not vindicate my character, how dare
you calumniate it? Does the sentence of deathl, which your unhallowed policy inflicts on my body, also condemn my tongue to silence,
and my reputation to reproach?  Your executioner may abridge the
period of my existence; but, while I exist, I shall not forbear to vindicate my character and motives fiom your aspersions.  As a man to
whom fame is dearer than life, I will make the last use of that life in
doing justice to that reputation which is to live after ime, and which
is the only legacy I can leave to those I honor and love, and for whom
I am  proud to perish. As men, my Lord, we must appear, on the
great day, at one common tribunal; and it will then remain for the
Searcher of all hearts to show a collective universe who are engaged
in the most virtuous actions, or actuated by the purest motives,- my
country's oppressors or -*
My Lord, shall a dying man be denied the legal privilege of
exculpating himself, in the eyes of the community, of an undeserved
reproach thrown upon him during his trial, by charging him with ambition, and attempting to cast away, for a paltry consideration, the
liberties of his country? Why, then, insult me? or, rather, why
insult justice, in demanding of me why sentence of death should not
be pronounced? I know, my Lord, that form prescribes that you
should ask the question; the form also presumes the right of answering! This, no doubt, may be dispensed with; and so might the whole

IV.
I AM charged with being an emissary of France.  An emissary of
France! - and for what end? It is alleged that I wished to sell the
independence of my country!  And for what end?   Was this the
object of my ambition? and is this the mode by which a tribunal of
justice reconciles contradictions? No! I am  no emissary.  My
ambition was to hold a place among the deliverers of my country,--
not in power, nor in profit, but in the glory of the achievement. Sell
my country's independence to France! And for what? For a change
of masters? No; but for ambition! O, my country! was it personal
ambition that could influence me? Had it been the soul of my actions,
could I not, by my education and fortune, by the rank and consideration of my family, have placed myself among the proudest of your
oppressors? My country was my idol. To it I sacrificed every selfish, every endearing sentiment; and for it I now offer up my life! 0
God! No! my Lord; I acted as an Irishman, determined on delivering my country from the yoke of a foreign and unrelenting tyranny, and
from the more galling yoke of a domestic faction, its joint partner and
perpetrator in the patricide, whose reward is the ignominy of existing
with an exterior of splendor, and a consciousness of depravity. It was
the wish of my heart to extricate my country from this doubly riveted
despotism.  I wished to place her independence beyond the reach of
any power on eartlh. I wished to exalt her to that proud station in
the world which Providence had fitted her to fill.
ConneUtion with France was, indeed, intended; but only as far as
mutual interest would sanction or require. Were the French to
assume any authority inconsistent with the purest independence, it
would be the signal for their destruction. We sought aid of themn; and
we sought it, as we had assurance we should obtailn it, - as auxiliaries
in war, and allies in peace. Were the French to come as invaders or
enemies, uninvited by the wishes of the People, I should oppose them
to the utmost of my strength. Yes, my countrymen, I would meet
them on the beach, with a sword in one hand and a torch in the other.
I would meet theil with all the destructive fury of war; and I would
animate you to imllmolate them in their boats, before they had contaminated, the soil. If they succeeded in landing, and if we were forced to
retire before suiperior discipline,, I would dispute every inch of ground,
raze every house, burn every blade of grass before them, and the last
intrenchment of liberty should be my grave. What I could not do
myself, if I should fall, I would leave in charge to my countrymen tc
accomplish; because I should feel conscious that life, more than death,
is unprofitable, when a foreign nation holds my country in subjection.
But it was not as ah enemy that the succors of France were to land.
[ looked, indeed, for the assistance of France; but I wished to prove
to France, and to the world, that Irishmen deserved to be assisted,
that they were indignant at slavery, and ready to assert the independ.

try the gua rantee which Washington procured for America,-- to procure an aid which, by its example, would be as important as by its
valor, - allies disciplined, gallant, pregnant with science and experience; who would preserve the good and polish the rough points of our
character; who would come to us as strangers, and leave uas as friends
after sharing our perils and elevating our destiny. These were my
objects; not to receive new task-masters, but to expel old tyrants.
These were my views, and these only become. Irishnmen. It was for
these ends I sought aid from France, because France, even as an
enemy, could not be more implacable than the enemy already in the
bosom of my country.*
V.
1 HAVE been charged with that importance, in the efforts to emancipate my country, as to be considered the key-stone of the combination
of Irishmen, or, as your JLordship expressed it, "the life and blood of
the conspiracy." You do me honor overmuch. kYou have given to
the subaltern all the credit of a superior. There are men engaiged in
this conspiracy who are not only superior to me, but even to your own
conceptions of yourself; my Lord; - men, before the splendor of whose
genius and virtues I should bow with respectful deference, and who
would think themselves dishonored to be called your friends, - who
would not disgrace themselves by shaking your blood-stained hand!t
What, my Lord, shall you tell me, on the passage to the scaffold
which that tyranny, of which you are only the intermediate minister,
has erected for my murder, that I am accountable for all the blood that
has been and will be shed, in this struggle of the oppressed against the
oppressor?  Shall you tell me this, and must I be so very a slave as
not to repel it? I, who fear not to approach the Omnipotent Judge,
to answer for the conduct of my short life, - am I to be appalled here,
before a mere remnant of mortality - by you, too, who, if' it were
possible to collect all the innocent blood that you have caused to be
shed, in your unhallowed ministry, in one great reservoir, your Lordship might swim in it! fLet no man dare, when I am dead, to charge me with dishonor.
Le3t no man attaint my menmory by believing that I could have engaged
in any cause but that of my country's liberty and independence, or that
I could have become the pliant minion of power in the oppression and
the miseries of my countrymen. The proclamation of the Provisional
Government speaks for my views.  No inference can be tortured from
it to countenance barbarity or debasement at home, or subjection,
humiliation or treachery, from abroad. I would not have submitted
to a foreign oppressor, for the same reason that I would resist the
domestic tyrant. In the dignity of freedom I would have fought upon
the threshold of my country, and its enemy should enter only by passing over my lifeless corpse. And am I, who lived but for my country

which I am now to offer up my life!
Miy Lords, you seem   impatient for the sacrifice.  The blood for
which you thirst is not congealed by the artificial terrors which surround your victim;--it circulates, warmly and unruffled, through the
channels which God created for nobler purposes, but which you are
bent to destroy, for purposes so grievous that they cry to IHeaven.  Be
ye patient! I have but a few words more to say.   I am going to my
cold and silent grave.  MIy lamp of life is nearly extinguished.  My
race is run.  The grave opens to receive me, -  and I sink into its
bosom! I have but one request to ask, at my departure fromn this
world;- it is the charity of its silence.  Let no man write my epitaph; for, as no man who knows my motives dare now vindicate them,
let not prejudice or ignorance asperse them. Let them and me repose
in obscurity and peace, and my tomb remain uninscribed, until other
times and other men can do justice to my character.  Wbhen my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, -- then, and not
till then, -  let my epitaph be written! I have done.
t. GREAT MINDS IN THEIR RELATIONS TO CItRISTIANITY. - Erskine, in the tral
of Williams,for publishing Paine's "A ge of Reason."
Thomas Erskine was born in Scotland, in 1750, an(d made Lord Chancellor in 1806. lie died
in 1823. I-Ie was one of the greatest advocates who have graced the Bar; and, in serious forensic oratory, has never been sirpassed. It has been said of him, that no man that ever lived so
elevated and honored his calling.
-IN running the mind along the long list of sincere and devout
Christians, I cannot help lamenting that Newton had not lived to this
day, to have had his shallowness filled up with this new flood of light,
poured upon the world by Mr. Thomas Paine.    But the subject is too
awfuhl for irony.  I will speak plainly and directly.  Newton was a
Clhristian!  Newton, whose mind burst forth from the fetters cast by
natulre upon our finite conceptions;--Newton, whose science was
truth, and the foundations of whose knowledge of it was philosophy'
not those visionary and arrogant presumptions which too often usurp
its name, but philosophy resting upon the basis of mathematics, which

like figures, canrot lie; - Newton, who carried the line and rule to the
uttermost barrier of creation, and explored the principles by which, no
doubt, all created matter is held together and exists. But this extraordinary man, in the mighty reach of his mind, overlooked, perhaps.
what a minuter investigation of the created things on this earth might
have taught him, of the essence of his Creator.  What, then, shall be
said of the great MIr. Boyle, who looked into the organic structure of all
imatter, even to the brute inanimate substances which the foot treads on?
Such a man may be supposed to have been equally qualified, with Mr.
Paine, to look up through nature to nature's God; yet the result of all
his contemplation was the most confirmed and devout belief in all which
the other holds in contempt, as despicable and drivelling superstition.
But this error might, perhaps, arise from a want of due attention to
the foundations of human judgment, anrd the structure of that Uinderstanding which God has given us for the investigation of truth.  Let
that question be answered by Mr. Locke, who was, to the highest
pitch of devotion and adoration, a Christian; -- Mr. Locke, whose
office was to detect the errors of thinking, by going up to the fountains
of thought, and to direct into the proper track of reasoning the devious mind of man, by showing him its whole process, from the first perceptions of sense to the last conclusions of ratiocination, putting a rein
upon false opinions by practical rules for the conduct of human judgment.  But these men were only deep thinkers, and lived in their
closets, unaccustomed to the traffic of the world, and to the laws which
practically regulate mankind.
Gentlemen, in the place where we now sit to administer the justice
of this great country, above a century ago, the never to be forgotten
Sir Matthew Hale presided, whose faith in Christianity is an exalted
commentary upon its truth and reason, and whose life was a glorious
example of its fruits in man, administering human justice with wisdom
and purity, drawn froni the pure fountain of the Christian dispensation, which has been, and will be, in all ages, a subject of the highest
reverence and admiration.  But it is said by the author that the
Christian fable is but the tale of the more ancient superstitions of the
world, and may be easily detected by a proper understanding of the
mythologies of the heathens.  Did Milton understand those mnythologies? Was he less versed than Mr. Paine in the superstitions of the
world?  No; they were the subject of his immortal song; and though
shut out from all recurrence to them, he poured them forth fiom the
story,s of a memory rich with all that man ever knew, and laid them
in their order, as the illustration of real and exalted faith, - tlhe
unquestionable source of that fervid genius which cast a sort of shade
upon all the other works of man.  But it was the light of the BODY
only that was extinguished; - "the celestial light shone inward, and
enabled him to justify the ways of God to man."

i. ATTEMPTS TO BIAS JUDGMENT IN CASE OF WILKES, 1768.--Lord lians,ield.
IT is fit to take some notice of the various terrors being hAld out tc
the judges on this Bench; the numerous crowds which have attended
and now attend in and about this hall, out of all reach of hearing what
passes in Court; and the tumults which, in other places, have shamefllly insulted all order and government.  Audacious addresses in
print dictate to us, from those they call the People, the judgment tc
be given now, and afterwards upon the conviction. Reasons of policy
are urged, from danger to the kingdom by commotions and general
confusion.  Give me leave to take the opportunity of this great and
respectable audience, to let the whole world know that all such
attempts are vain. Unless we have been able to find an error which
will bear us out to reverse the outlawry, it must be affirmed.  The.
Constitution does not allow reasons of state to influence our judgments.
God forbid it should! We must not regard political consequences,
how formidable soever they might be; if rebellion was the certain
consequence, we are bound to say, "]Fiatjtustitia, ruat celumn." We
are to say what we take the law to be; if we do not speak our real
opinions, we prevaricate with God and our own consciences.
I pass over many anonymous letters I have received: those in print
are public; and some of them have been brought judicially before the
court.  Whoever the writers are, they take the wrong way; I will do
my duty unawed. What am I to fear? That mendax injamia from
the Press, which daily coins false facts and false motives?  The lies
of calumny carry no terror to me. I trust that my temper of mind,
and the color and conduct of my life, have given me a suit of armor
against these arrows.  If, during this King's reign, I have ever supported his Government, and assisted his measures, I have done it without any other reward than the consciousness of doing what I thought
right. If I have ever opposed, I have done it upon the points themselves, without mixing in party or faction, and without any collateral
views. I honor the King, and respect the People; but, many things
acquired by the favor of either are, in my account, objects not worth
ambition. I wish popularity  but it is that popularity which follows,
not that which is run after; it is that popularity which, sooner or
laIer, never fails to do justice to the pursuit of noble ends by noble
means. I will not do that which my conscience tells me is wrolng,
upon this occasion, to gain the huzzas of thousands, or the daily praise
oD all the papers which come from the press; I will not avoid doing what
I -think is right, though it should draw on me the whole artillery of
libels, - all that falsehood and malice can invent, or the credulity of a
dzluded populace can swallow. I can say, with a great magistrat,e,

apon an occasion and under circumstances not unlike, "iE o hoe
anirmo semper fui, ut invidiam   virtute partam, gloriam, non
invidiam, putarem. "
The threats go further than abuse; personal viDlence is denouncedc.
I do not believe it; it is not the genius of the worst men of this
country, in the worst of times. But I have set my mind at rest. The
last end that can happen to any man never comes too soon, if he falls
in support of the law and liberty of his country, --for liberty is
synonymous with law and government.  Such a shock, too, might be
productive of public good; it might awake the better part of the kingdom out of that lethargy which seems to have benumbed them, and
bring the nmad back to their senses, as men intoxicated are sometimes
stunned into sobriety.  Once for all, let it be understood that no
endeavors of this kind will influence any man who at present sits. here;
no libels, no threats, nothing that has happened, nothing that can
happen!
8. DEFENCE OF M. PELTIER FOR A LIBEL ON NAPOLEON. -Sir J. UMackintosh.
GENTLEMEN, there is one point of view in which this case seems to
merit your most serious attention.  The real prosecutor is the master
of the greatest empire the civilized world ever saw; the defendant is
a defeneeless, proscribed exile. I consider this case, therefore, as the
first of a long series of conflicts between the greatest power in the
world, and the ONLY FREE PRESS remaining in Europe.  Gentlemen,
this distinction of the English Press is new, - it is a proud and melancholy distinction. Before the great earthquake of the French Revolution had swallowed up all the asylums of free discussion on the Continent, we enjoyed that privilege, indeed, more fully than others, but
we did not enjoy it exclusively. In Holland, in Switzerland, in the
imperial towns of Germany, the Press was either legally or practically
free. Holland and Switzerland are no more; and, since the commencement of this prosecution, fifty imperial towns have been erased
trom the list of independent States, by one dash of the pen.
One asylum of free discussion is still inviolate. There is still one
spot in Europe where man can freely exercise his reason on the most
important concerns of society, - where he can boldly publish his judg
ment on the acts of the proudest and most powerful tyrants.  The
Press of England is still free. It is guarded by the free Constitution
of our forefathers.  It is guarded by the hearts and arms of Englishmen; and, I trust I may venture to say, that, if it be to fall, it will fall
only under the ruins of the British empire.  It is an awful consideration, Gentlemen. Every other monument of European liberty has
perished. That ancient fabric; which has been gradually raised by
the wisdom and virtue of our fathers, still stands.  It stands, thanks
be to CGod! solid and entire, - but it stands alone, and it stands amid
ruins! Believing, then, as I do, that we are on the eve of a great
struggle, - that this is only the first battle between reason and power
-that you have now in your hands, colmmitted to your trust, the onlgTHE STAND.AR`. PEAKER.
remains of free discussion in Europe, nlow confined tc this kingdom,
addressing you, therefore, as the guardians of the most importaint
interests of mankind, - cruvinced that the unfettered exercise of reason
lepends more on your present verdict than on any other that was
ever delivered by a jury, -  I trust I may rely with confidence on the
istue, I trust that you will consider vourselves as the advanced
guartl of liberty; as having this day to fight the first battle of free
discussion against the most formidable enemy that it ever encountered!
9. THE INSTIGATORS OF TREASON, 1807. - William Wirt.
William Wirt, one of the brightest ornaments of the American bar, was born at Bladensburg,
MIaryland, November 8th, 1772. The most memorable case in which his talents as an a(ivocate were exercised was the celebrated trial of Aarol Bln'r, in 1807, for treason, in which WVirt
was retained as counsel for the Government. IIis exquisite description of the temptation of
Blennerhassett by Burr is a most graceful and masterly specimen of forensic art. In 1817 AMr.
WVirt was appointed Attorney General of the United States. I_e died February 18th, 1834.
THE inqruiry is, whether presence at the overt act be necessary to
make a man a traitor?  The Gentlemen say that it is necessary, -  that
he cannot be a principal in the treason, without actual presence. The,
framers of the Constitution, informed by the examples of Greece and
Rome, and foreseeing that the liberties of this Republic might, one
day or other, be seized by the daring ambition of some domestic
usurper, have given peculiar importance and solemnity to the crime
of treason, by ingrafting a provision against it upon the Constitution.
But they have done this in vain, if the construction contended for on
the other side is to prevail.  If it require actual presence at the scene
of the assemblage to involve a man in the guilt of treason, how easy
will it be fbr the principal traitor to avoid this guilt, and escape punishment forever!   He mnay go into distant States, from one State to
another.  He may secretly wander, like a demon of darkness, fromrn
one end of the Continent to the other.   He may enter into the confidence of the simple and unsuLspecting. He may prepare the whole
mechanism of the stupendous and destructive engine, put it in motion
and let the rest be done by his agents. He may then go a hundred
miles from the scene of action.  Let him keep himself only firom   the
seene of the assemblage, and the immediate spot of the battle, and he
is innocent in law, while those he has deluded are to suffer the death
of traitors!  Who is the more guilty of this treason, the poor, weak,
deluded instruments, or the artful and ambitious man, who corrupted
and misled them?
There is no comparison between his guilt and theirs; and yet you
secure impunity to him, while they are to suffer death!    Is this rea
son?   Is this moral right?   No man, of a sound mind and heart, can
doubt, for a moment, between the comparative guilt of Aaron Burr, the
prime mover of the whole uischief, and of the poor men on Blennerhassett's Island, who called themselves "Burr's men."      In the case
of murder, who is the more guilty, the ignorant, deluded perpetrator,
or the abominable instigator?  Sir, give to the Constitution the construction contended for on the other side, and you might as we11
366FORENSIC AND JUDICIAL.--.'IR'l
expunge the crime of treason from your criminal code, nay, you had,etter do it, fbr by this construction you hold out the lure of impunity
to the most dangerous men in the community, men of ambition and
talents, while you loose the veiingeance of the law on the comparatively
innocent. If treason ought to be repressed, I ask you, who is the
mnore dangerous and the more likely to commit it, the mere instru.
mont, who applies the force, or the daring, aspiring, elevated genius,
who'devises the whole plot, but acts behind the scenes 2
10. BURR AND BLENNERHASSETT. - William TWirt.
A PLAIN man, who knew nothing of the curious transmutations
which the wit of man can work, would be very apt to wonder by what
kind of legerdemain Aaron Burr had contrived to shuffle himself down
to the bottom of the pack, as an accessory, and turn up poor Blennerhassett as principal, in this treason.  WhVo, then, is Aarorn Burr, and
what the part which he has borne in this transaction? I e is its
author, its projector, its active executor.  Bold, ardent, restless and
aspiring, his brain conceived it, his hand brought it into action.
Who is Blennerhassett? A native of Ireland, a man of letters, Aho
fled firom the storms of his own country, to find quiet in ours.  On
his arrival in America, he retired, even from  the population of the
Atlantic States, and sought quiet and solitude in the bosom of our
western forests.  But he brought with him taste, and science, and
wealth; and " lo, the desert smiled! "  Possessing himself of a beautiful island in the Ohio, he rears upon it a palace, and decorates it
with every romantic embellishment of fancy. A shrubbery, that Shenstone might have envied, blooms around him. Music, that might have
charmed Calypso and her nymphs, is his. An extensive library spreads
its treasures before him.  A philosophical apparatus offers to him all
the secrets and mysteries of nature. Peace, tranquillity and innocence,
shed their mingled delights around him.  And, to crown the enchantment of the scene, a wife, who is said to be lovely even beyond her
sex, and graced with every accomplishment that can render it irresistible, had blessed him with her love, and made him the father of several
children. The evidence would convince you, Sir, that this is but a
faint picture of the real life. In the midst of all this peace, this innocence, and this tranquillity, - this feast of the mind, this pure banquet
of the heart, - the destroyer comes. Hie comes to turn this paradise
into a heil. Yet tne flowers do not wither at his approach, and no
aonitory snudcdering through the bosom of their unfortunate possessor
uarLs mlin of the rulri that is coming upon him.  A stranger presents;imrn,sc. It is Aaron Burr. Introduced to their civilities by the
aivgn rang whicih hic had lately held in his country, he soon finds his
wa,vy to t;hclr hearts, by the dignity and elegance of his demeanor, the
right ndcl beeutv of his conversation, and the seductive and fascinating
power of his address.  The conquest was not difficult. Innocence is
ever snmple and credulous.  Conscious of no designs itself, it suspects
367NMODES OF IMPROVING THE VOICE.
It is as esseatial for a speaker to endeavor, by his appearance and manner,
to please the eye, as by his tones to please the ear. His dress should be decent
and unaffected.  His position should be easy and graceful. If he stand in a
perfectly perpendicular posture, an auditor would naturally say, " He looks
like a post."  If the hands work in direct lines, it -will give him the appear.
ance of a two-handled pump. The first point to be attained is to avoid awk
ward habits: such as resting the chief weight of the body first on one foot and
the]n on the other; swinging to and fro; jerking forward the upper part of
the body, at every emphatic word; keeping the elbows, pinioned to the sides:.
and sawing the air with one hand, with one unvaried and ungraceful motion.
As gesture is used for the illustration and enforcement of language, so it
should be limited, in its application, to such words and passages as admit of or
require it. A judicious speaker will not only adapt the general style and
manner of his action to the subject, the place, and the occasiob, but even
when he allows himself the greatest latitude, he will reserve his gesture, or, at
least, the force and ornament of.it, for those parts of his discourse for which
he also reserves his boldest thoughts and his most brilliant expressiols.
As the head gives the chief grace to the person, so does it principally contribute to the expression of grace in delivery. It must be held in an erect and
natural position. For, when drooped, it is expressive of humility; when turned
upwards, of arrogance; when inclined to one side, it expresses languor; and
when stiff and rigid, it indicates a lack of ease and self-possession. Its movements should be suited to the character of the delivery; they should accord with
the gesture, and fall in with the action of the hands, and the motions of the
body. The eyes, which are of the utmost consequence in aiding the expression of the orator, are generally to be directed as the gesture points; except
when we have occasioni to condemn, or refuse, or to require any object to be
removed; on which occasion, we should at the same moment express aversion in our countenance, and reject by our gesture A listless, inanimate
expression of countenance, will always detract from the effect of the most
eloquent sentiments, and the most appropriate utterance.
TRAINING AND STRENGTHENING THE VOICE.
In order to read and speak well, it is necessary to have all the vocal
elements under complete command, so that they may be duly applied whenever they are required for the vivid and elegant delineation of the sense and
sentiment of discourse. The student, therefore, should first practise on the
thirty-five alphabetio elements, in order to insure a true and easy execution
of their unmixed sounds. This will be of more use than pronouncing words
in which they occur; for, when pronounced singly, the elements will receive a
concentration of the organic effort, which will give them a clearness of sound
and a definite outline, if we may so speak, at their extremes, making a fine
preparation for their distinct and forcible pronunciation in the compounds of
speech. He should then take one or more of the compound sounds, and carry it
through all the degrees of the diatonic and concrete scales, both in an upward
and a downward direction, and through the principal forms of the wave.  ie
should next take some one familiar sentence, and practise upon it with every
variety of intonation of which it will admit. He should afterwards run through
the various vocal keys, and the forms of the cadence; and, lastly, he should
recite, with all the force that he can command, some passage which requires
great exertion of the voice. If he would acquire power and volume of utterance, he must practise in the open air, with his face to the wind, his body
perfectly erect, his chest expanded, his tongue retracted and depressed, and
the cavity of his mouth as much as possible enlarged; and it is almost unnec -
essary to add, that anything which improves the general tone of the health
will proportionably affect the voice. If to this elementary practice the student
add a careful and discriminating analysis of some of the best pieces which ou.'

none in others. It wears no guards before its breast.  Every door
and portal and avenue of the heart is thrown open, and all who choose
it enter.  Such was the state of Eden, when the serpent entered its
bowers  
Thlle prisoner, in a more engaging form, winding himself into the
open and unpractised heart of the unfortunate Blennerhassett, found
but little difficulty in changing the native character of that heart, and
the objects of its affection.  By degrees, he infuses into it the poison
of his own ambition. He breathes into it the fire of his own courage;
a daring and desperate thirst for glory; an ardor, panting for all the
storm, and bustle, and hurricane of life. In a short time, the whole
nian is changed, and every object of his former delight relinquished.
No more he enjoys the tranqiuil scene: it has become flat and insipid
to his taste.  His books are abandoned. His retort and crucible are
thrown aside. His shrubbery blooms and breathes its fragrance upon
the air in vain - he likes it not. IHis ear no longer drinks the rich
melody of music; it longs for the trumpet's clangor, and the cannon's
roar. Even the prattle of his babes, once so sweet, no longer affects
him; and the angel smile of his wife, which hitherto touched his
bosom with ecstasy so unspeakable, is now unfelt and unseen. Greater
objects have taken possession of his soul. His imagination has been
dazzled by visions of diadems, and stars, and garters, and titles of
nobility. He has been taught to burn with restless emulation at the
names of great heroes and conquerors,-- of Cromnwell, and Cmsar, and
Bonaparte. His enchanted island is destined soon to relapse into a
wilderness; and, in a few months, we find the tender and beautiful
partner of his bosom, whom he lately " permitted not the winds of"
summer "' to visit too roughly,"- we find her shivering, at midnight,
on the wintry banks of the Ohio, and mingling her tears with the
torrents that froze as they fell.
Yet this unfortunate man, thus deluded from his interest and his
happiness, - thus seduced from the paths of innocence and peace, -
thus confounded in the toils which were deliberately spread for him,
and overwhelmed by the mastering spirit and genius of another,--

my str ngth, halve it; if still beyond my strength, quarter it; if still
necessary, subdivide it into eighths; and when, by this process, I have
reduced it to the proper standard, take one of these sections and toss
it; ith an air of elephantine strength and superiority.  If I find.my.elf capable of conducting, by a fair course of reasoning, any one
of his propositions to an absurd conclusion, I will not begin by stating
that absurd conclusion as the proposition itself which I am going to
encounter.  I will not, in commenting on the Gentleman's authoritie-,
thalnk the Gentlemran, with sarcastic politeness, for introducing them,
declare that they conclude directly against him, read just so much of
the authority as serves the purpose of that declaration, omitting that
which contains the true point of the case, which makes against me;
nor, if forced by a direct call to read that part also, will I content
myself by running over it as rapidly and inarticulately as I can, throw
down the book with a theatrical air, and exclaim, "Just as I said!"
when I know it is just as I had not said.
I know that, by adopting these arts, I might raise a laugh at the
Gentleman's expense; but I should be very little pleased with myself
if I were capable of. enjoying a laugh procured by such means. I
know, too that, by adopting such arts, there will always be those standing around us, who have not comprehended the whole merits of the
legal discussion, with whom I might shake the character of the Gentleman's science and judgment as a lawyer. I hope I shall never be
capable of such a wish; and I had hoped that the Gentleman himself
felt so strongly that proud, that high, aspiring, and ennobling magnanimity, which I had been told conscious talents rarely fail to inspire,
that he would have disdained a poor and fleeting triumph, gained by
ameans like these.
12. GUILT CANNOT KEEP ITS OWN SECRET.--Daniel WFebster, on the trial of J
F. Knapp, 1830,for murder.
AN aged man, without an enemy in the world, in his own house,
anl in his own bed, is made the victim of a butcherly murder, for mere
pay. The fatal blow is given! and the victim passes, without a struggle or a motion, from the repose of sleep to the repose of death! It
ik the assassin's purpose to make sure work. He explores the wrist
for the pulse.  He feels for it, and ascertains that it beats no longer!
It is accomplished. The deed is done.  He retreats, retraces his stetp
to the window, passes out through it as he came in, and escapes. He
has clone the murder; - no eye has seen him, no ear has heard him.
r:he secret is his own, - and it is safe!
Ah! Gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake.  Such a secret can

speak of that eye which glances through all disguises, and beholds
everything as in the splendor of noon, such secrets of guilt are
never safe firom detection, even by men.  True it is, generally speaking, that "murder will out."  True it is, that Providence hath so
ordained, and' doth so govern things, that those who break the great
law of Hleaven, by shedding man's blood, seldom succeed in avoiding
discovery.  Especially, in a case exciting so much attention as thiS
discovery mnst come, and will come, sooner or later.  A thousand eyes
turn at once to explore every man, every thing, every circumstance,
connected with the time and place; a thousand ears catch every whisper; a thousand excited minds intensely dwell on the scene, shedding
all their light, and ready to kindle the slightest circumstance into a
blaze of discovery.  Meantime, the guilty soul cannot keep its own
secret.  It is false to itself; or, rather, it feels an irresistible impulse
of conscience to be true to itself.  It labors under. its guilty possession, and knows not what to do with it.  The human heart was not
made for the residence of such an inhabitant.  It finds itself preyed on
by a torment, which it dares not acknowledge to G-od nor man.  A
vulture is devouring it, and it can ask no sympathy or assistance, either
from Heaven or earth.  The secret which the murderer possesses soon
coInes to possess him; and, like the evil spirits of which we read, it
overcomes him, and leads him whithersoever it will.  He feels it beat,
ing at his heart, rising to his throat, and demanding disclosure.  He
thinks the whole world sees it in his face, reads it in his eyes, and
almost hears its workings in the very silence of his thoughts.  It has
become his master.  It betrays his discretion, it breaks down his courage, it conquers his prudence.  When suspicions, from without, be-gin
to embarrass him, and the net of circumstance to entangle him, the
fatal secret struggles, with still greater violence, to burst forth. It Mn.st
be confessed; - it will be confessed; - there is no refuge from confession but suicide - and suicide is confession!
13. MORAL POWER THE MOST FORMIDABLE.-Judge McLean, 1838, on enterprises from the U. States a,ainst the British possessions in Canada.
IF there be any one line of policy in which all political parties
agree, it is, that we should keep aloof from the agitations of other Governments; that we shall not intermingle our national concerns with
-theirs; and much more, that our citizens slhall abstain from acts which
lead the subjects of other Governments to violence and bloodshed.
These violators of the Law show themselves to be enemies of their
country, by trampling under foot its laws, compromising its honor, and
involving it in the most serious embarrassment with a foreign and
fi.endily Nation.  It is, indeed, lamentable to reilect, that such men,
under such circumstances, mlay hazard the peace of the country.  If
they were to come out in arra.y against their own Government, the consequence to it would be far less serious.  In such an effort, they could
not involve it in much bloodshed, or in a heavy expenditure, nor':70FORENSIC AND JUDICIAL. ---  UGO.
would its commerce and general business be materially injure&amp;.  But
a war with a powerful Nation, with whom we have the most extensive
relations, commercial and social, would bring down upon our counltry
the heaviest calamity.  It would dry up the sources of its prosperity,
and deluge it in blood.
The great principle of our Republican institutions cannot be propagated by the sword.  This can be done by moral force, and not physical. If we desire the political regeneration of oppressed Nations, we
must show them the simplicity, the grandeur, and the freedom, of our
own Government.    We must recommend it to the intelligence and
virtue of other Nations, by its elevated and enlightened action, its
purity, its justice, and the protection it affords to all its citizens, and
the liberty they enjoy.  And if, in this respect, we shall be faithful to
the high bequests of our fathers, to ourselves, and to posterity, we
shall do more to liberate other Governments, and emancipate their
subjects, than could be accomplished by millions of bayonets.  This
moral power is what tyrants have most cause to dread. It addresses
itself to the thoughts and the judgments of men.  No physical force
can arrest its progress.  Its approaches are unseen, but its consequences are deeply felt.  It enters garrisons most strongly fortified,
and operates in the palaces of kings and emperors.  We should cherish t1his power as essential to the preservation of our own Government;
and as the most efficient means of ameliorating the condition of our
race. And this can only be done by a reverence for the laws, and by
the exercise of an elevated patriotism.  But, if we trample under our
feet the laws of our country, - if we disregard the faith of treaties, and
our citizens engage without restraint in military enterprises against the
peace of other Governments, - we shall be considered and treated, and
justly, too, as a Nation of pirates.
14. TIE DEATH PENALTY.- Original Translation from Victor Hugo.
From Victor Hugo's speech at the trial of his son, Charles IIugo, in Paris, June 11th, 1851,
zharged with violating the respect due to the laws, in an article in the journal " L' Evene.
ment," upon the execution of Montcharmont, a sentenced criminal. Notwithstanding the
father's eloquent appeal, Charles Hugo was found " guilty " by the Jury, and sentenced to six
months' imprisonment, and a fine of five hundred francs.
GENTLEMEN OF TPHE JURY, if there is a culprit here, it is not my son,
- it is myself, - it is I! - I, who for these last twenty-five years have
opposed capital punishment, - have contended for the inviolability of
human life, - have committed this crime, for which my son is now
arraigned.  Here I denounce myself, Ir. Advocate General! I have
comLmitted it under all aggravated circumstances; deliberately, repeat.
edly, tenaciously.  Yes, this old and absurd lex talionis'- this law
of blood for blood - I have combated all my life -  all my life, Gentleimen of the Jury!   And, while I have breath, I will continue to
combat it, by- all my efforts as a writer, by all my words and all
my votes as a legislator! I declare it before the crucifix; before
that victinm of the penalty of death, who sees and hears us; before
that gibbet, to which, two thousand years ago, for the eternal istrutc
tion of the generations, the human law nailed the Divine!
381THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
In all that my son has written on the subject of capital punishment,
-- anld for writing and publishing which he is now before you on trial,
--- in all that he has written, he has merely proclaimed the sentiments
with which, from his. infancy I have inspired him.  Gentlemen Jurors,
the right to criticize a law, and to criticize it severely, - especially a
penal law, - is placed beside the duty of amelioration, like the torch
beside the work under the artisan's hand. This right of the journalist
is as sacred, as necessary, as imprescriptible, as the right of the legislator.
What are the circumstances?   A man, a convict, a sentenced
wretch, is dragged, on a certain morning, to one of our public squares.
There he finds the scaffold! He shudders, he struggles, he refuses to
die. He is young yet - only twenty-nine. Ah! I know what you
will say,-" He is a murderer! "  But hear me. Two officers seize
him. His hands, his feet, are tied. He throws off the-two officers. A
frightful struggle ensues. His feet, bound as they are, become entangled in the ladder. He uses the scaffold against the scaffold! The
struggle is prolonged. Horror seizes on the crowd. The officers,sweat and shame on their brows, - pale, panting, terrified, despairing,
- despairing with I know not what horrible despair, - shrinking under
tlhat public reprobation which ought to have visited the penalty, and
spared the passive instrument, the executioner, - the officers strive
savagely. The victim clings to the scaffold, and shrieks for pardon.
His clothes are torn, - his shoulders bloody, - still he resists.  At
length, after three quarters of an hour of this monstrous effort, of this
spectacle without a name, of this agony, - agony for all, be it understood, - agony for the assenmbled spectators as well as for the condemnned man, - after this age of anguish, Gentlemen of the Jury, they
take back the poor wretch to his prison. The People breathe again.
The People, naturally merciful, hope that the man will be spared.
But no, - the guillotine, though vanquished, remains standing. There
it frowns all day, in the midst of a sickened population. And at night,
the officers, reinfoiced, drag forth the wretch again, so bound that he
is but an inert weight, - they drag him forth, haggard, bloody, weeping, pleading, howling for life, - calling upon God, calling upon his
father and mother, - for like a very child had this man become in the
prospect of death, - they drag him forth to execution. He is hoisted
on to the scaffold, and his head falls!- And then through every conscience runs a shudder. Never had legal murder appeared with an
aspect so indecent, so abominable. All feel jointly implicated in the
deed. It is at this moment that from a young man's breast escapes a
cry, wrung from his very heart, - a cry of pity and of anguish, --a
cry of horror, - a cry of humanity. And this cry you would punish!
And, in face of the appalling facts which I have narrated, you would
say to the guillotine, "Thou art right! " and to Pity, saintly Pity.
"Thou art wrong! "  Gentlemen of the Jury, it cannot be!  Gen,
tiemen, I have finished.

hIow absurd are the sophisms and predictions by which the advo.

once frightful and contemptible, and reducing all things to the level
of an insecure, and ignoble, and bloody ecluality! Such are the reasonings by which we are now to be persuaded that liberty is incompatible with private happiness or national prosperity.  To these we
need not now answer in words, or by reference to past and questionable examnples; but we put them down at once, and trample them contemptuously to the earth, by a short appeal to the existence and
condition of America!   What is the country of the universe, I
would now ask, in which property is most sacred, or industry most
sure of its reward? Where is the authority of law most omnipotent?
Where is intelligence and wealth mnost widely diffused, and most rapidly progressive? Where, but in America? - in Amerlica, who laid
the foundation of her Republican Constitution in a violent, radical,
sanguinary Revolution; America, with her fundamental Democracy,

of Tyranny, and without one of the checks or safeguards by which

There is something at once audacious and ridiculous in maintaining
such doctrines, in the face of such experience. Nor can anything be
founded on the novelty of these institutions, on the pretence that they
have not yet been put fairly to their trial. America has gone on

2 FALSE NOTIONS OF GOVERNMENT VIGOR.--Rev. Sydney Smith
I CANNOT describe the horror and disgust which I felt' at hearing
Mr. Perceval call upon the then Ministry for measures of vigor in
Ireland. If I lived at Hampstead upon stewed meats and claret,--if
I walked to church, every Sunday, before eleven young gentlemen of
my own begetting, with their faces washed, and their hair pleasingly
combed, -if the Almighty had blessed me with every earthly comfort,
- how awfully would I pause before I sent for the flame and the sword
over the cabins of the poor, brave, generous, open-hearted peasants of
Ireland!
How easy it is to shed human blood; how easy it is to persuade
ourselves that it is our duty to do so, and that the decision has cost
us a severe struggle; how much, in all ages, have wounds and shrieks
and tears been the cheap and vulgar resources of the rulers of mankind; how difficult and how noble it is to govern in kindness, and to
found an empire upon the everlasting basis of justice and affection!
But what do men call vigor?  To let loose hussars, and to bring up
artillery, to govern with lighted matches, and to cut, and push, and
prime, - I call this, not vigor, but the sloth of cruelty and ignorance.
The vigor I love consists in finding out wherein subjects are aggrieved,
in relieving them, in studying the temper and genius of a People, in
consulting their prejudices, in selecting proper persons to lead and
manage them, in the laborious, watchful, and difficult task of increasing public happiness, by allaying each particular discontent. In this
way only will Ireland ever be subdued. But this, in the eyes of Mr.
Pereeval, is imbecility and meanness;-- houses are not broken open,
women are not insulted, the People seem all to be happy, - they are
not ridden over by horses, and cut by whips. Do you call this vigor?
Is this Government?
&amp; REJECTION OF THE REFORM BILL, 1831.--Rev. Sydney Smith.
MR. CHAIRMAN, I feel most deeply the rejection of the Reform Bill
by the Lords, because, by putting the two Houses of Parliament in
collision with each other, it will impede the public business, and
diminish the public prosperity. I feel it as a churchman, because I
cannot but blush to see so many dignitaries of the Church arrayed
against the wishes and happiness of the Peopie.  T feel it, more than
all, because I believe it will sow the seeds of deadly hatred between
the aristocracy and the great mass of the People. The loss of the Bill

the expiration rf the winter, that this Bill will pass, than I have that
the annual tax bills will pass; and greater certainty than this no nlan
can have, for Franklin tells us there are but two things certain in this
world,-- death and taxes. As for the possibility of the House of
Lords preventing, ere long, a reform of Parliamont, I hold it to be the
most absurd notion that ever entered into human imagination.  I do
not mean to be disrespectful; but the attempt of the Lords to stop the
progress of reform  reminds me very forcibly of the great stormn of
Sidinouth, and of the conduct of the excellent Mrs. Partington on that
occasion.  In the winter of 1824, there set in a great flood upon that
town; the tide rose to an incredible height; the waves rushed in
upon the houses, and everything was threatened with destruction.  In
the midst of this sublime and terrible storm, Dame Partington, who
lived upon the beach, was seen at the door of her house, with mop and
pattens, trundling her mop, squeezing out the sea-water, and vigorously pushing away the Atlantic Ocean! The Atlantic was roused;
Mrs. Partington's spirit was up; but I need not tell you that the contest was unequal. The Atlantic Ocean beat Mrs. Partington. She
was excellent at a slop, or a puddle, but she should not have meddled
with a tempest.
Gentlemen, be at your ease, -be quiet and steady.  You will beat
MWrs. Partington.
4. ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG MEN OF ITALY. -Joseph Mazzinz.
The following extract, translated from the Italian, is from an impassioned Address, delivered
by Mazzini, at Milan, on the 25th of July, 1848, at the request of a National Association, on the
occasion of a solemn commemoration of the death of the brothers Bandi6ra, and their fellowmartyrs, at Cosenza.
WHEVIN I was commissioned by you, young men, to proffer in this
temple a few words consecrated to the memory of the brothers Bandiera, and their fellow-martyrs: at Cosenza, I thought that some one
of those who heard me might perhaps exclaim, with noble indignation,
"Why thus lament over the dead?   The martyrs of liberty are only
worthily honored by winning the battle they have begun.  Cosenza,
the land where they fell, is enslaved; Venice, the city of their birth,
is begirt with strangers.  Let us emancipate them; and, until that
moment, let no words pass our lips, save those of war."  But another
thought arose, and suggested to me, Why have we not conquered?
Why is it that, whilst our countrymen are fighting for independence in
the North of Italy, liberty is perishing in the South?  Why is it
that a war which should have sprung to the Alps with the bound of a
lion has dragged itself along for four months with the slow, uncertain
motion of the scorpion surrounded by the circle of fire? How has the
rapid and powerful intuition of a People newly arisen to life been
converted into the weary, helpless effort of the sick man, turning from
side to side?
Ah! had we all arisen in the sanctity of the idea for which our
martyrs died; had the holy standard of their faith preceded our youth

to battle; had we made of our every thought an action, and of c.
every action a thought; had we learned firom them that liberty and
independence are one;-- we should not now have war, but victory!
Cosenza would not be compelled to venerate the memory of her martyrs in secret, nor Venice be restrained from honoring them with a
monument; and we, here gathered together, might gladly invoke
those sacred names, without uncertainty as to our future destiny, or a
cloud of sadness on our brows; and might say to those preculrsor souls,
"Rejoice, for your spirit is incarnate in your brethren, and they
are worthy of you."  Could Attilio and Emilio Bandiera, and their
fellow-martyrs, now arise from the grave and speak to you, they would,
believe me, address you, though with a power very different from that
given to me, in counsel not unlike that which now I utter.
Love! Love is the flight of the soul towards God; towards the
great, the sublime, and the beautiful, which are the shadow of God
upon earth. Love your family; the partner of your life; those around
you, ready to share your joys and sorrows; the dead, who were dear
to you, and to whom yout were dear. Love your country. It is your
name, your glory, your sign among the Peoples.  Give to it your
thought, your counsel, your blood. You are twenty-four millions of
men, endowed with active, splendid faculties; with'a tradition of
glory, the envy of the Nations of Europe; an immense future is
before you,- your eyes are raised to the loveliest Heaven, and around
you smiles the loveliest land in Europe; you are encircled by the Alps
and the sea, boundaries marked out by the fi- ger of God for a people
of giants. And you must be such, or nothing.  Let not a man of that
twenty-four millions remain excluded from the fraternal bond which
shall join you together; let not a look be raised to that Heaven, which
is. not that of a free man. Love humanity. You can only ascertain
your own mission from the aim placed by God before humanity at
large.  Beyond the Alps, beyond the sea, are other Peoples, now
fighting, or preparing to fight, the holy fight of independence, of nationality, of liberty; other Peoples, striving by different routes to reach
the same goal.  Unite with them, - they will uniite winth you.
And love, youlng men, love and reverence the Idceal; it is the country of the spirit, the city of the soul, in which all are brethren who
believe in the inviolability of thought, and in the dignity of our immortal natures.  From  that high sphere spring the principles which
alone call redeem the Peoples. Love enthusiasm, - the pure dreams
of thle,irgin soul, and the lofty visions of early youth; for they are
the perfume of Paradise, which the soul preserves in issuing from the
hands of its Creator.  Respect, above all things, your conscience;
nave upon your lips the truth that God has placed in your hearts;
and, while working together in harmony in all that tends to the emancipation of our soil, even with those who differ from you, yet ever bear
erect your own banner, and boldly promulgate your faith.
Such words, young men, would the martyrs of Cosenza have spokemn
had they been living amongst you. And here, where, perhaps, invoked

5. APPEAL TO TIIE HUNGARIANS, 1849. -Louts Kossuth.
OuR Fatherland is in danger! Citizens! to arms! to arms.
Unless the whole Nation rise up, as one man, to defend itself, all the
noble blood already shed is in vain; and, on the ground where thu
ashes of our ancestors repose, the Russian knout will rule over an
enslaved People!  Be it known to all Hungary, that the Austrian
Emperor has let loose upon us the barbarous hordes of Russia; that
a Russian armny of forty-six thousand men has broken    into oulr
country from Gallicia, and is. on the march; that another has entered
Transylvania; and that, finally, we can expect nlo foreign assistance, as
the People that sympathize with us are kept down by their rulers,
and gaze only in dumb silence on our struggle.  We have nothing to
rest our hopes upon, but a righteous God, and our own strength.  If
we do not put forth that strength, God will also forsake us.
Hungary's struggle is no longer our struggle alone.  It is the
struggle of popular freedom against tyranny. Our victory is the
victory of freedom, -our fall is the fall of freedom.  God has chosen
us to free the Nations from bodily servitude. In the wake of our
victory will follow liberty to the Italians, Germans; Poles, Vallachians,
Sclavonians, Servians, and Croatians.  With our fall goes down the
star of freedom over all.  People of Hungary! will you die under
the exterminating sword of the savage Russians?   If not, defend
yourselves! Will you look on while the Cossacks of the far North
tread under foot the bodies of your fathers, mothers, wives and
children?  If riot, defend yourselves! Will you see a part of your
fellow-citizens sent to the wilds of Siberia, made to serve in the wars
of tyrants, or bleed under the murderous knout?  If not, defelld
yourselves! Will you behold your villages in flames, and your harvestsdestroyed?  Will you die of hunger on the land which your
sweat has made fertile? If not, defend yourselves!
We call upon the People, in the name of God and the Country, to
rise up in arms.  In virtue of our powers and duty, we order a genral crusade of the People against the enemy, to be declared from
3very pulpit and from every town-house of the country, and made
known by the continual ringing of bells. One great effort, and the
country is forever saved! We have, indeed, an army which numbers

language contains, both in prose and verse, and if he strenuously st: deam4r to
apply to them all the scientific principles which he has learned, there can be
no doubt that he will acquire a manner of delivery which will do ample;ustice to any subject on which he may be called to exercise his vocal
uowers.
In all reading and public speaking, the management of the breath requires
great caDr, so as not to be obliged to divide words from one another which
have so intimate a connection that they ought to be pronounced in the same
breath, and without the least separation. Many sentences are marred, and thW
rorce of the emphasis totally lost, by divisions being made in the wrong place.
To avoid this, every one, while he is reading or speaking, should be careful to
provide a full supply of breath for what he is to utter. It is a great mistake
to imagine that the breath must be drawn only at the end of a period, when
the voice is,allowed to fall. It may easily be gathered at intervals of the
period, when the voice is only suspended for a moment; and, by this management, we may have always a sufficient stock for carrying on the longest
sentence, without improper interruptions.
The importance of a skilful management of the breath in utterance will be
made apparent by a little practice. It is a good exercise for the pupil to
repeat the cardinal numbers rapidly up to twenty, inhaling a full breath at the
commencement. He may, by practice, make his breath hold out till he reaches
forty and more, enunciating every syllable distinctly.
It must always be part of a healthful physiological regimen to exercise the
voice daily, in reading or speaking aloud. The habit of Demosthenes, of walking by the sea-shore and shouting, was less important, in accustoming him  
the sound of a multitude, than in developing and strengthening his vocal
organs. The pupil will be astonished to find how much his voice will gain
in power by daily exercise. "Reading aloud and recitation," says Andrew
Combe, "are more useful and invigorating muscular exercises than is generally imagined; at least, when managed with due regard to the natural powers
of the individual, so as to avoid efibrt and fatigue.. Both require the varied
activity of most of the muscles of the trunk to a degree of which few are
conscious till their attention is turned to it. In forming and undulating the
voice, not only the chest, but also the diaphragm and abdominal muscles, are in
constant action, and communicate to the stomach and bowels a healthy and
agreeable stimulus."
How doubly important does the judicious and methodical exercise of the
voice thus become to him who would make it at once an effective instrumcnt
of conveying truth to his fellow-men, and of improving his own physical
strenigth and capacity!

The acute accent (') is employed to indicate that the vowel over which it.s placed is.not merged in the preceding syllable; as, blessid, Tempt; the

self-government.  Shall freedom die away for centuries, and mankind
become nothing more than the blind instrument of the ambition of
some few,- or shall the print of servitude be wiped out from the brow
of humanity, and mailkind become noble in itself, and a noble instrumnent to its own forward progress? Woe, a hundred-fold woe, to every
Nation, which, confident in its proud position of to-day, would carelessly regard the comprehensive struggle of those great principles!
It is the mythical struggle between Heaven and Hell. Woe, a
thousand-fold woe, to every Nation which would not embrace, within
its sorrows and its cares, the future, but only the present time! In
the flashing of a moment the future becomes present, and the objects
of our present labors have passed away. As the sun throws a mist
before the sun rises, se the spirit of the future is seen in the events
of the present.
A philosopher was once questioned, how could he prove the existence of God?  "Why," answered he, " by opening my eyes. God is
seen everywhere, - in the growth of the grass, and in the movement
of the stars; in the warbling of the lark, and in the thunder of
Ileaven." Even so I prove that the decisive struggle in mankind's
destiny draws near. I appeal to the sight of your eyes, to the pulsations of your hearts, and to the judgments of your minds. How blind
are those who assert that the continent of Europe, but for the revolutionary acts of certain men, would be quiet and contented! Contented? With what?    With oppression and servitude?   France
contented, with its Constitution subverted? Germany, contented, with
being but a fold of sheep, pent up to be shorn by some thirty petty
tyrants? Switzerland contented, with the threatening ambition of,neroaching despots? Italy contented, with the King of Naples?or with the priestly Government of Rome, the worst of human inventi:.n?  Austria, Rome, Prussia, Dalmatia, contented with having
been diiven to butchery, and, after having been deceived, plundered,
oppressed, and laughed at as fools? Poland contented with being
murd, red? Hungary, my poor Hungary, contented with being more
than murdered -buried alive?- -for it is alive!  Russia contented
with slavery? Vienna contented? Lombardy, Pesth, Milan, Venice,
Prague, contented? --contented with having been ignominiously
branded, burned, plundered, sacked, and its population butchered

hIalf of the European continent contented with the scaffold, with the
hangman, with the prison, with having no political rights at all,
but having to pay innumerable millions for the highly beneficial purpose of being kept in a state of serfdom? That is the condition of
the continent, -and is it not ridiculous and absurd in men to prate
about individuals disturbing the peace and tranquillity of Europe?
Ah! Gentlemen, humanity has a nobler destiny than to be the footstool to the ambition of certain families. Let the tIouse of Austria
trust to its bayonets and its Czar. The People of Hungary and myself- we trust to God! I know that the light has spread, and even
bayonets think; I know that all the Czars of the world are but
mean dust in the hand of God; and so I firmly hope, - nay, I am
certain,- l shall yet see Hungary independent and free!.
7. IIEROISM OF THE IIUNGARIAN PEOPLE.-- Kossuth, Nov. 12, 1851.
GENTLEMEN have said that it was I who inspired the Hungarian
People. I cannot accept the praise. No, it was not I who inspired
the Hungarian People. It was the Hungarian People who inspired
me. Whatever I thought, and still think,--whatever I felt, and
still feel, - is but the pulsation of that heart which in the breast of
my People beats!  The glory of battle is for the historic leaders.
Theirs are the laurels of immortality. And yet, in encountering the
danger, they knew that, alive or dead, their names would, on the lips
of the People, forever live. How different the fortune. - how nobler,
how purer, the heroism, - of those children of the People, who went
forth freely to meet death in their country's cause, knowing that
where they fell they would lie, undistinguished and unknown, - their
names unhonored and unsung! Animated, nevertheless, by the love
of freedom and fatherland, they went forth calmly, singing their
National anthems, till, rushing upon the batteries, whose cross-fire
vomited upon them death and destruction, they took them without
firing a shot, - those who fell falling with the shout, "Hurrah for
Hungary! "  And so they died by thousands --the unnamed demigods! Such is the People of Hungary. Still it is said, it is I who
have inspired them. No! - a thousand times, no!  It is they whe
have inspired me.
8. "IN A JUST CAUSE."--Kossuth,.Dec. 11, 1851.
To prove that Washington never attached to his doctrine of neui.
trality niore than the sense of teniporary policy, I refer to one of his
letters, written to Lafayette, wherein he says:--" Let us only have
twenty years of peace, anld our country will come to such a degree of
power and wealth that we will be able, in a just cause, to defy whatever power on earth."
" In a just cause! "  Now, in the name of eternal truth, and by
%lU ihat is sacred and dear to man, since the history of mankind it
27aM8C                  THE STANDA~fD SPEAKER.
recorded tnere has been no cause more just than the cause of Hull
gary! Never was there a People, without the slightest reason, mort
sacrilegiously, more treacherously, and by fouler means, attackecl than
Hungary!    Never have crime, cursed ambition, despotism   and
violence, in a more wicked manner, united to crush down freedon-, and
the Tery life, than against Hungary! Never was a country moro
mortally outraged than Hungary.  All your sufferings, all your coml
plaints, which, with so much right, drove your forefathers to take up
arms, are but slight grievances, compared with those immense, deep
wounds, out of which the heart of Hungary bleeds! If the cause
of my people is not sufficiently just to insure the protection of God,
and the support of good-willing men, then there is no just cause, and
no justice on Earth; then the blood of no new Abel will move
towards Heaven; the genius of charity, Christian love and justice,
will mourningly fly the Earth; a heavy curse will upon mortality fall,
oppressed men despair, and only the Cains of humanity walk proudly,
with impious brow, above the ruins of Liberty on Earth!
You have attained that degree of strength and consistency, when
your less fortunate brethren oF mankind may well claim your brotherly, protecting hand.  And here I stand before you, to plead the
cause of these, your less fortunate brethren - the cause of humanity.
I may succeed, or I may fail.  But I will go on, pleading with that
faith of martyrs by which mountains were moved; and I may displease' you, perhaps; still I will say, with LuLther, "M liay God help
me--I can do     zo otherwise! " Woe, a thousand-fold' woe, to
humanity, should there nobody on earth be to maintain the laws of
humanity! Woe to humanity, shoulcl even those who are as mighty
as they are free not feel interested in the maintenance of the laws
of mankind, because they are laws, but only in so far as some scal-ty
money interests would desire it! Woe to humanity, if every despot
of the world may dare to trample down the laws of humanity, and no
free Nation arise to make respected these laws!  People of the
United States, humanity expects that your glorious Republic will prove
to the world that Republics are fbrmed on virtue.  It expects to see
you the guardians of the law of humanity!
9. PEACE INCONSISTENT WITH OPPRESSION. --Kossuth, December 18, 1851.
Is the present condition of Europe peace? Is the scaffold peace?
--the scaffold, on which, in Lombardy, the blood of three thousand
seven liundred and forty-two patriots was spilled during three short
years! Is that peace?    Are the prisons of Austria, filled with
patriots, peace? Or is the murmur of discontent from all the Nations
peace? I believe the Lord has not created the world to be in such a
peaceful condition.  I believe He has not created it to be the prison
of humanity, or the dominion of the Austrian jailer.  No! The
present condition of the world is not peace! It is a condition DfPOLITICAL AND OCCASIONAL. - BULWER.
opprcssion on the European Continent,, and because there is this conditionl of oppression there cannot be peace; for so long as men and
Nations are oppressed, and so long as men and Nations are discontented, there cannot be peace--there cannot be tranquillity.  War,
like a volcano, boiling everlastingly, will, at the slightest opportunity,
break out again, and sweep, away all the artificial props of peace, and
of those interests which on peace depend. Europe is contiinually
a great battle-field, -a great barrack.  Such is its condition; and,
therefore, let not those who call themselves men of peace say they will
not help Europe because they love peace! Let them confess truly
that they are not men of peace, but only the upholders of the oppression of Nations. With me and with my principles is peace, because I
will always faithfully adhere to the principles of liberty; and only on
the principles of liberty can Nations be contented, and only with the
contentment of Nations can there be peace on the earth.  With me,rnd with my principles there is peace, - lasting peace, - consistent
yeace!  With the tyrants of the world there is oppression, struggles,
and war!
10. TI-IE TWENTY-SECOND OF DECEMBER, 1620.--Sir Henry Bulwer, 1850.
THE history of that plain and simple sect, which has had so great an
influence on the character of your People, stands forth as one of the
loftiest among the many monuments which attest the truth of that
great Christian moral, "The proud shall be abased, the humble
exalted."  It convinces us, if at this day we wanted to be convinced.
that it is not the mere will of arbitrary Princes, nor the vain bull of
arrogant Pontiffs, that can lay prostrate the independence of the human
mind. All assumption only breeds resistance, as all persecution only
makes martyrs.  Who, indeed, at the period to which this day recalls
us, were the mighty of the earth?  On the throne of England then
sat a prince justly proud--if pride could ever rest upon sound
foundations--of the triple crown which had recently become his
family inheritance. In Fraifce the sceptre was held in the hands of a
still haughtier race, which ruled with supreme authority over the most
gallant and chivalrous People in the world.'What has become of the
illustrious lines of these two royal houses, - of that of the sovereifgn
who gloried in the " non-conformity bill," or that of those sovereigns
amongst whose deeds are recorded the massacre of St. Bartholomew
and the revocation of the edict of Nantes? The crown of the Stuarts
has melted into air in the one kingdom; the sceptre of the Bourbons
has been shattered into atoms in the other. But here, on this spot,
where I am speaking, still stands, erect and firm, the pilgrim's staf
From the bruised seed of the poor and persecuted Puritan has arisen

boasted in the proud name of Speedwell, the other- had the gentle
appellation of the May,ower. Which arrived first at its destination?
The vaunting Speedwell was obliged to put into port, while the modest.Itayf1ower dashed gallantly across the ocean.  You were simple and
unpretending in the day of your weakness; be never vain or arrogant
in the day of your strength.  You were superior to your adversity  
you have only to be equal to your prosperity.  And, if you ever wish
to know the principal cause of the proud position you have already
achieved, you may look for it confidently among the trials and difliculties through which you have passed.  Yes, if you have made your
country, believe me, it is no less true that your country has made you.
I grieve, whilst I rejoice, to say that it is amidst the general confusion of crude experinments, terrible uncertainties, mystic dreams, and
ripening convulsions, that alone and singly is to be seen towering the
common Genius of Albion, and of Albion's transatlantic children. No
tempest, raised in the heated atmosplere of fantastic theory, clouds
her brow; no blood, spilt in civil butchery, bedaubs her garments; no
poisons, corroding the principles of public and domestic morality, tear
her vitals. Serene and undisturbed, she moves onward firmly. Trade
and agriculture strew her way with plenty; law and religion march
in her van; order and freedom follow her footsteps. And here, at this
solemn moment, whilst pouring out our libations to the sacred memory
of our sainted'fathers -- here, I invoke that Genius to bless the union
of our kindred races, to keep steadfast in our hearts the pleasant
recollections of the past, to blend gratefiully in our minds the noble
aspirations of the future, to hallow in one breath the twin altars we
will raise in common to Memory and Hope! -  to " Old England and
Young America!"
11. BRITISH AGGRESSIONS, 1768.- Josiah Quincy, Jr. Born, 1743; died, 1775.
IF there ever was a time, this is the hour for Americans to rouse
themselves, and exert every ability. Their all is at hazard, and the
die of fate spins doubtful.  British takations, suspensions of legislatures, and standing armies, are but some of the clouds which overshadow
the northern world. Ndw is the time for this People to summon every
aid, humnan and divine; to exhibit every moral virtue, and call forth
every Christian grace.  The wisdom of the serpent, the innocence of
the dove, and the intrepidity of the lion, with the blessing of God, will
yet save us from the jaws of destruction.
By the sweat of our brow we earn the little we possess; from nature
we derive the common rights of man; - and by charter we claim the
liber-ties of Britons!  Shall we--dare we-puLsillanimously surrender our birthright?  Is the obligation to our fathers discharged?  
is the debt we owe posterity paid?  Answer me, thou coward, who
hidest thyself in the hour of trial! - if there is no rewar(d in this life,
no prize of glory in the next, capable of animnating thy dastard soul,
thimk and tremble, tlhou iiscreant! at the whips and stripes thy mas.

ter shall lash thee with on earth, and the flames and scorpions thy

these times, should they find we tamely gave away, without one noble
struggle, the most invaluable of earthly blessings? As they drag the
galling chain, will they not execrate us?  If we have any respect for
things sacred, any regard to the dearest treasure on earth,- if we
have one tender sentiment for posterity, if we would not bei despised
by the whole world, --let us, in the most open, solemn manner and
with determined' fortitude, swear we will die, if we cannot live,
freemen!
12. ELOQUENCE AND LOGIC. - William C. Preston.
OUR popular institutions demand a talent for speaking, and create a
taste for it. Liberty and eloquence are united, in all ages.  Where
the sovereign power is found inthe public mind and the public heart,
eloquence is the obvious approach to it. Power and honor, and all
that can attract ardent and aspiring natures, attend it.  The noblest
instinct is to propagate the spirit, --" to make our mind the mind of
other men," and wield the sceptre in the realms of passion. In the art
of speaking, as in all other arts, a just combination of those qualities
necessary to the end proposed is the true rule of taste.  Excess is
always wrong. Too much ornament is an evil, - too little, also. The
one may impede the progress of the argument, or divert attention from
it, by the introduction of extraneous matter; the other may exhaust
attention, or weary by monotony. Elegance is in a just medium. The
safer side to err on is that of abundance, - as profusion is better tlhan
poverty; as it is better to be detained by the beauties of a landscape,
than by the weariness of the desert.
It is commonly, but mistalienly, supposed that the enforcing of
truth is most successfully effected by a cold and formal logic; but the
subtleties of dialectics, and the forms of logic, may play as fantastic
tricks with truth, as the most potent magic of Fancy. The attempt
to apply mathematical precision to moral truths is always a failure,
and generally a dangerous one. If man, and especially masses of men,
were purely intellectual, then cold reason would alone be influential to
convince; but our nature is most complex, and many of the great
truths which it most concerns us to know are taught us by our
instincts, our sentiments, our impulses, and our passions.  Even in
regalad to the highest and holiest of all truth, to know which concerns!as here and hereafter, we are not permitted to approach its investigation in the confidence of proud and erring reason, but are taught to
become as little children before we are worthy to receive it.  It is to
this complex nature that the speaker addresses himself, and the degree
Df power with which all the elements are evoked is the criterion of the
orator. His business, to be sure, is to convince, but more to persuade;
and l most of all, to inspire with noble and generous passions. It is the
383THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
cant of criticisni, in all ages, to make a distinction between logic and
eloquence, and to stigmatize the latter as declamation.  Logic ascertains the weight of an argument, Eloquence gives it momentum.  The
difference is that between the vis inertice of a mass of metal, and the
same ball hurled from the cannon's mouth. Eloquence is an argument
alive and in motion,- the statue of Pygmalion inspired with vitality.
13. SENDING RELIEF TO IRELAND, 1847.--S. S. Prentiss.
WE have assembled, not to respond to shouts of triumph from the
West'* but to answer the cry of want and suffering which comes from
the East.  The Old World stretches out her arms to the New.  The
starving parent supplicates the young and vigorous child for bread.
There lies, upon the other side of the wide Atlantic, a beautiful island,
famous in story and in song.  Its area is not so great as that of the
State of Louisiana, while its population is almrtost half that of the
Union.   It has given to the world niore than its share of genius and
of greatness.  It has been prolific in statesmen, warriors, and poets.
Its bravxe and generous sons have fbught successfully all battles but
their own. In wit and humor it has no equal, while its harp, like its
history, inoves to tears, by its sweet but melancholy pathos.  Into this
fair region God has seen fit to send the most terrible of all those fearful ministers who fulifil his inscrutable decrees.  The earth has failed
to give her increase; the common mother has fobrgotten her offspring,
and her breast no longer affords them their accustomed nourishment.
Famine, gaunt and ghastly famine, has seized a nation in its strangling
grasp; and unhappy Ireland, in the sad woes of the present, forgets,
for a imomnent, the gloomy history of the past.
O! it is terrible, in this beautifutl world, which the good Goa
has given us, and in which there is plenty for us all, that men should
die of starvation! You, who see, each day, poured, into the lap of
your city, food sufficient to assuage the hunger of a nation, can form
but an imperfect idea of the horrors of famine.  In battle, in the fulness of his pride and strength, little reaks the soldier whether the hiss
ing bullet sings his sudden requiem, or the cords of life are severed by
the sharp steel.  But he who dies of hunger wrestles alone, day after
day, with his grim  and unrelenting enemy.  The blood recedes, the
flesh deserts, the muscles relax, and the sinews grow powerless.  At
last, the mind, which, at first, had' bravely nerved itself for the contest,
gives way, under the mysterious influences which govern its union with
the body.  Then he begins to doubt the existence of an overruling
Providence; he hates his fellow-men, and glares upon them with the
longings of a cannibal, and, it may be, dies blaspheming!
Wlho will heJsitate to give his mite to avert such awful results?
Surely not the citizens of New Orleans, ever famed for deeds of benevoence and charity.  Freely have your hearts and purses opened, hero* An allusion to the victories in Mexico, the news of which had beeD, recently

tofore, to the call of suffering humanity.  Nobly did you respond to
oppressed Greece and to struggling Poland. Within Erin's borders is
an enemy more cruel than the Turk, more tyrannical than the Rus
sian. Bread is the only weapon that can conquer him. Let us, then,
ioad ships with this glorious munition, and, in the name of our common
humanity, wage war against this despot Famine. Let us, in God's
name, "cast our bread upon the waters," and if we are selfish enough
to desire it back again, we may recollect the promise, that it shall
return to us after nmany days.
14. A PLEA FOR THIE SAILOR.-- William Mountford.
0, THE difference between sea and land! The sailor lives a life of
daily, hourly, momentary risk, and he reckons it by voyages. He
goes on your errands, he dares dangers for you, he lives a strange life
for you. Think of what winter is at sea. Think of what it is to have
the waves discharge themselves on a ship, with a roar like artillery,
and a force not much less. Think of what it is for a sailor to be aloft
in the rigging, holding on by a rope, wet with the rain, or numbed
with the cold, and with the mast of the ship swaying, with the wind,
like a reed. Think of what it is when men drop from the yard-arms
into the sea, or when they are washed from the deck like insects.
Think of what it is, day and night, without rest and without sleep, iq
strive against a storm, - against the might of wind and waves,every wave a mighty enemy to surmount. Think what it is to strike
on a rock,- to shriek but once, and then, perhaps, be drowned.
Think of the diseases that come of hardships at sea. Think of what it
is to be sick in a lazaretto, - to lie dying in a foreign hospital.
Think of all this, and then, perhaps, you will think rightly of what it
is to be a sailor.
Think of what you yourselves owe to the sailor. It is through his
intervention that you are possessed of those comforts that make of a
house a home. Live comfortably you cannot, - live at all, perhaps.
you cannot, - without seamen will expose themselves for you, risk
themselves for you, and, alas! often, very often, drown, - drown in
your service, - drown, and leave widows and orphans destitute.  0!
what a consideration it is, that, so often, my happiness is from suffering somewhere! My salvation is from a death upon a cross. The
church I worship in has every one of its pillars deep founded in a
imartyr's grave. The philosophy that delights me for its truth is what
i)me wise man had first to learn in bitterness.  My comforts are mine,
many of them, throughi other men's miseries. Commerce spreads the
world about me with blessings, but not without there being shipwrecks
from it on every coast. and deaths by drowning, - several every day,
the year round.
Ah! yes; to beg with me, to plead with me, for the widow and
orphan of the mariner, there comes, from many a place where seamen
hai e lied, a call, a prayer, a beseeching voice; - a cry from the coast

385TITE STANDARD SPEAKER.
of Guinea, where there is fever evermnore; a cry from Arctic seas,
where icebergs are death; a cry from coral reefs, that ships are wreck~e
on horribly; a cry from many a foreign city, where the sailor, as he
dies, speaks of his family, and is not understood; a cry from mid-ocean,
where many a sailor drops into a sudden grave! They ask your help,
your charity, for the widows and the orphans of those who, in times part,
have gone down to the sea, - have gone down to the sea in ships!
15. OUR RELATIONS TO ENGLAND, 1824. -Edward Everett.
WVHo does not feel, what reflecting American does not aclcnowledge,
the incalculable advantages derived to this land out of the deep fountains of civil, intellectual, and moral truth, from which we have drawn
in England?   What American does not feel proud that his fathers
were the countrymen of Bacon, of Newton, and of Locke?  Who does
not know, that, while every pulse of civil liberty in the heart of the
[British empire beat warm and fill ini the bosom of our ancestors, the
sobriety, the firmness, and the dignity, with which the cause of free
urinciples struggled into existence here, constantly found encouragement and countenanue from the friends of liberty there?  Who does
not remember, that, when the Pilgrims went over the sea, the prayers
of the faithful British confessors, in all the quarters of their dispersion, went over with them, while their aching eyes were strained till
the star of hope should go up in the western skies?  And who will
ever forget, that, in that eventful struggle which severed thece youthful republics from the British crown, there was not heard, throughout
our continent in arms, a voice which spoke louder for the rights of
America than that, of Burke, or of Chatham, within the walls of the
British Parliament, and at the foot of the British throne?  No; for
myself, I can truly say, that, after my native land, I feel a tenderness
and a reverence for that of my fathers.  The pride I take in my own
colntry makes me respect that from which we are sprung.  In touching the soil of England, I seem to return, like a descendant, to the old
family seat,- to come back to the abode of an aged and venerable
parent. I acknowledge this great consanguinity of nations. The
sound of my native language, beyond the sea, is a music, to my ear,
beyond the richest strains of Tuscan softness or Castilian majesty.  I
am not yet in a land of strangers, while surrounded by the manners,
the habits, and the institutions, under which I have been brought up.
i wander delighted through a thousand scenes, which the historians
and the poets have made familiar to us, --of which the names are
interwoven with our earliest associations.  I tread with reverence the
spots where I can retrace the footsteps of our suffering fathers.  The
pleasant land of their birth has a claim on my heart.  It seems to me
a classic, yea, a holy land; rich in the mlemory of the great and good,
the champions and the martyrs of liberty, the exiled heralds of truthE:and iicher, as the parent of this land of promise in the West.
I anm not-- I need not say I am not - the panegyrist of England
I ami not dazzled by her riches, nor awed by her power.  The septre,
386POLITICAL ANL') OCCASIONAL. - EVERETT.:,he -nitre, and the coronet, -  stars, garters, and blue ribbons, -.- seem
cO me poor thins for great men to contend for.  Nor is my admiration
awakened by her armies, mustered for the battles of Europe; her
aavies, overshadowing the ocean; nor her empire, grasping the furthest
lEast. It is these, and the price of guilt and blood by which they are
too often maintained, which are the cause why no friend of liberty can
s-alute her with undivided affections.  But it is the cradle and the
refuge of free principles, though often persecuted; the school of religious liberty, the more precious for the struggles through which it has
passed;' the tomnbs of those who have reflected honor on all who speak
the English tongue; it is the birth-place of our fathers, the home of
the Pilgrins; - it is these which I love and venerato in England.  I
should feal ashamed of an enthusiasm for Italy and Greece, did I not
also feel it for a laild like this.  In an American, it would seem it me
Jegenerate and ungrateful to hang with passion upon the traces of
Eiomer soaDd Virgil, and follow, without emotion, the nearer and plainer
footsteps of Shakspeare and Milton.  I should think him cold in his
love for his native land who felt no melting in his heart for that other
native coluntry, which holds the ashes of his forefathers.
16. IMPERISHABILITY OF GREAT EXAMPLES. -Edward Everett.
To be cold and breathless,- to feel not and speak not, - this is not
the end of existence to the men who have breathed their spirits into the
institutions of their country, who have stamped their characters on the
pillars of the age, who have poured their hearts' blood into the channels
of the public prosperity.  Tell me, ye who tread the sods of yon
sacred height, is Warren dead?  Can you not still see him, not pale
and prostrate, the blood of his gallant heart pouring out of his ghastly
wound, but moving resplendent over the field of honor, with the rose
of Heaven upon his cheek, and the fire of liberty in his eye?  Tell me,
ye who make your pious pilgrimage to the shades of Vernon, is Washington, indeed, shut up in that cold and narrow house?  That which
made these men, and men like these, cannot die. The hand that traced
the charter of Independence is, indeed, motionless; the eloquent lips
that sustained it are hushed; but the lofty spirits that conceived,
resolved, and maintained it, and which alone, to such men, "make it
life to live," these cannot expire:
" These shall resist the empire of decay,
When time is o'er, and worlds have passed away;
Cold in the dust the perished heart may lie,
But that which warmed it once can never die."
17. CIVILIZATION OF AFRICA, 1S32.--Edward Everett.
IT is said that it is impossible to civilize Africa.  Why?  Why is
it impossible to civilize man in one part of the earth more than in
another?  Consult history.  Was Italy -was Greece --the cradle
ef civilization?  No.  As far back as the lights of tradition reach,

MORAL AND DIDACTIC.
1, TR1THI TIIE OBJECT OF ALL STUDIES. -Original Trandlation.
Tir supreme want, as well as the supreme blessing of man, is truth,
yes, truth in religion, which, in giving us pure and exalted ideas of the
Divinity, teaches us, at the same time, to render Him the most worthy
and intelligent homage; - truth in morals, which indicates their duties
to all classes, at once without rigor and without laxity;-- truth in
politics, which, in making authority more just and the people more
acquiescent, saves governments from the passions of the multitude, and
the multitude from the tyranny of governments; - truth in our legal
tribunals, which strikes Vice with consternation, reassures Innocence,
and accomplishes the triumph of Justice; - truth in education, which,
bringing the conduct of instructors into accordance with their teaching,
exhibits them as the models no less than the masters of infancy and
youth; - truth in literature and in art, which preserves them from
the contagion of bad taste, from false ornaments as well as false
thoughts;-- truth in the daily commerce of life, which, in banishing
fraud and imposture, establishes the common security; --truth in
everything, truth before everything, - this is; in effect, what the whole
human race, at heart,'solicit. Yes, all men have a consciousness, that
truth is ever beneficent, and falsehood ever pernicious.

Africa was the cradle of science, while Syria, and Greece, atnd Italy
were yet covered with darkness.  As far back as we can trace the
first rudiments of improvement, they came from the very head waters
of the Nile, far in the interior of Africa; and there are yet to be
found, in shapeless ruins, the monuments of this primeval civilization.
To come down to a much later period, while the West and North of
ELrope were yet barbarous, the Mediterranean coast of Afrtica was
filled with cities, academies, museums, churches, and a highly civilized
population. What has raised the Gaul, the Belgium, the Germany,
the Scandinavia, the Britain, of ancient geography, to their present
improved and improving condition?  Africa is not now sunk lower than
most of those countries were eighteen centuries ago; and the engines
of social influence are increased a thousand-fold in numbers and efficacy.  It is not eighteen hundred years ago since Scotland, whose
metropolis has been called the Athens of modern Europe, - the country
of Hume, of Smith, of Robertson, of Blair, of Stewart, of Brown, of
Jeffrey, of Chalmers, of Scott, of Brougham, - was a wilderness, infested
t,y painted savages. It is not a thousand years since the North of
Germany, now filled with beautiful cities, learned universities, and the
best educated population in the world, was a dreary, pathless forest.
Is it possible that, before an assembly like this,- an assembly of
Alnericans, - it canl be necessary to argue the possibility of civilizing
Africa, through the instrumentality of a colonial establishment, and
that in a comparatively short time?  It is but about ten years since
the foundations of the colony of Liberia were laid; and every one
acquainted with the early history of New England knows that the colony at Liberia has made much greater progress than was made by the
settlement at Plymouth in the same period.  More than once were the
first settlements in Virginia in a position vastly less encouraging than
that of the American colony on the coast of Africa; and yet, from
these feeble beginnings in New England and Virginia, what has not been
brought about in two hundred years?   Two hundred years ago, and
the Continent of North America, for the barbarism of its'native population, and its remoteness from the sources of improvement, was all
that Africa is now.  Impossible to civilize Africa! Sir, the work is
already, in no small part, accomplished.
18. WHAT GOOD WILL THE MONUMENT DO? 1833.--Edward Everett.
I AM met with the great objection, What good will the Mloonumert
do?  I beg leave, Sir, to exercise my birthright as a Yankee, and
answer this question by asking two or three more, to which I believe
it will be quite as difficult to furnish a satisfactory reply.  I am asked,
What good will the monument do? And I ask, what good does anything do?  What is good?   Does anything do any good? The persons who suggest this objection, of course, think that there are somle
Drojects and undertakings that do good; and I should therefore like
to have the idea of good explainod, and analyzed, and run out to its
388POLITICAL AND OCCASIONAL. - WEBSTER.
t:ements..Vhen this is done, if I do not demonstrate, in about twe
minutes, that the monument does the same kind of good that anything
else does, I shall consent that the huge blocks of granite, already laid,
should be reduced to gravel, and carted off to fill up the mill-pond;
for that, I suppose, is one of the good things. Does a railroad or canal
do good? Answer, yes. And how? It facilitates intercourse, opens
markets, and increases the wealth of the country.  But what is this
good for? Why, individuals prosper and get rich. And what good
does that do? Is mere wealth, as an ultimate end, - gold and silver,
without an inquiry as to their use, - are these a good? Certainly not.
I should insult this audience by attempting to prove that a rich man,
as such, is neither better nor happier than a poor one. But, as men grow
rich, they live better. Is there any good in this, stopping here? Is
mere animal life - feeding, working, and sleeping like an ox - entitled
to be called good?  Certainly not. Bult these improvements increase
the population.  And what good does that do? Where is the good in
counting twelve mnillions, instead of six, of mere feeding, working,
sleeping animals? There is, then, no good in the mere animal life,
xcept that it is the physical basis of that higher moral existence,
which resides in the soul, the heart, the mind, the conscience; in good
principles, good feelings, and the good actions (and the more disinterested, the more entitled to be called good) which flow from them.
Now, Sir, I say that generous and patriotic sentiments, sentiments
which prepare us to serve our country, to live for our country, to die
for our country,-- feelings like those which carried Prescott and Warren and Putnam to the battle-field, are good, - good, humanly speaking, of the highest order. It is good to have them, good to encourag
them, good to honor them, good to commemorate them; and whatever
tends to animate and strengthen such feelings does as much right down
practical good as filling up low grounds and building railroads.  This
is my demonstration.
19. TO THE REVOLUTIONARY VETERANS. -Daniel lWebster, at the laying of the corner-stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, June 17, 1825.
WE hold still among us some of those who were active agents in
the scenes of 1775, and who are now here, from every quarter of New
England, to visit once more, and under circumstances so affecting,L had almost said so overwhelming, - this renowned theatre of their
courage and patriotism.
Venerable men! you have coime down to us from a former generation. Heaven has bounteously lengthened out your lives, that you
might behold this joyous day. You are now, where you stood, fifty
years ago, this very hour, with your brothers, and your neighbors,
shoulder to shoulder, in the strife for your country. Behold, how
altered. The same heavens are indeed over your heads; the same
9oean rolls at your feet; but all else how changed! You hear now
uo roar of hostile cannon, you see now no mixed volumes of smol eTHE STANDARD SPEAKIIJ.
and fiame rising firom burning Charlestown. The ground strewed with
fhe dciad and the dying; the impetuous charge; the steady and successful repulse; the loud call to repeated assault; the summoning of
all that is manly to repeated resistance; a thousand bosoms freely and
fearlessly bared in an instant to whatever of terror there may be in
war and death; -all these you have witnessed. but you witness them no
more. All is peace. The heights of yonder metropolis, its towers and
roofs, which you then saw filled with wives and children and countrymen in distress and terror, and looking with unutterable emotions for
the issue of the combat, have presented you to-day with the sight of
its whole happy population come out to welconme and greet you with'an universal jubilee. All is peace; and God has granted you this sight
of your country's happiness, ere you slumber in the grave forever.
But, alas! you are not all here. Time and the sword have thinned
your ranks. Prescott, Putnam, Stark, Brooks, Read, Pomeroy, Bridge!
--our eyes seek for you in vain amidst this broken band.  But
let us not too much grieve, that you have met the cofmimon fate of
men. You lived to see your country's independence established, and
to sheathe your swords from war. On the light of Liberty, you saw
arise the light of Peace, like
"Another morn
Risen on mid-noon; "and the sky on which you closed your eyes was cloudless.
But --ah!--him! the first great martyr in this great cause!.
Him! the premature victim of his own self-devoting heart! Him!
the head of our civil councils, and the destined leader of our military
bands, whom nothing brought hither but the unquenchable fire of his
own spirit! Him! cut off by Providence in the hour of overwhelming anxiety and thick gloom; falling, ere he saw the star of his country rise; pouring out his generous blood, like water, before he knew
whether it would fertilize a land of freedom or of bondage!- how shall
I struggle with the emotions that stifle the utterance of thy name!
Our poor work may perish, but thine shall endure! This monument
may moulder away; the solid ground it rests upon may sink down to
a level with the sea; but thy memory shall not fail! Wheresoever
among men a heart shall be found that beats to the transports of
patriotism  and liberty, its aspirations shall be to claim kindred with
thy spirit!
Veterans! you are the remnant of many a well-fought field. You
bring with you marks of honor from Trenton and Mofrmouth, fronm
Yorktown, Camden, Bennington, and Saratoga.  Veterans of half a
century! when, in your youthful days, you put everything at hazard
in your country's cause, good as that cause was, and sarnguine as youth
is, still your fondest hopes did not stfetch onward to an hour like thisI

20. SANCTITY OF STATE OBLIGATIONS, 1840.--Webster.
W.u have the good fortune, under the blessing of a benign Providence, to live in a country which we are proud of for many things, --
for its independence, for its public liberty, for its free institutions, for
its public spirit, for its enlightened patriotism; but we are proud also.
- and it is among those things we should be the most proud of, - we
are proud of its public justice, of its sound faith, of its substantially
correct morals in the administration of the Government, and the general conduct of the country, since she took her place among the nations
of the world.  But among the events which most threaten our character and standing, and which so grossly attach on these moral principles that have hitherto distinguished us, are certain sentiments which
have been broached among us, and, I am sorry to say, have more supporters than they ought, because they strike at the very foundation of
the social system. I do not speak especially of those which have been
promulgated by some person in my own State, but of others, which go
yet deeper into our political condition.  I refer to the doctrine that
one generation of men, acting under the Constitution, cannot bind
another generation, who are to be their successors; on which ground
it is held, among other things, that State bonds are not obligatory.
What! one generation cannot bind another? Where is the link of
separation?  It changes hourly. The American community to-day is
not the same with the American community to-morrow. The comniunity in which I began this day to address you is not the same as it is
at this moment.   How abhorrent is such a doctrine to those great
truths which teach us that, though individuals flourish and decay,
States are immortal; that political communities are ever young, ever
green, ever flourishing, ever identical! The individuals who compose
them may change, as the atoms of our bodies change; but the political
commiunity still exists in its aggregate capacity, as do our bodies in
their natural; with this only difference, - that we know that our
natural frames must soon dissolve, and return to their original dust;
but, for our country, she yet lives, - she ever dwells in our hearts,
and it will, even at that solemn moment, go up as our last aspiration
to Hleaven, that she may be immortal!
f1.'TIE FOURTH OF JULY. -Daniel Webster, at lFashington D) C., July 4, 1851, om
layzng the corner-stone of the new wing of the Capitol.
THIs is that day of the year which announced to mankind the great
Gact of American Independence!  This fresh and brilliant morning
blesses our vision with another beholding of the birth-day ( f our nation'
89tTMI STANDARD SPEAKER.
and we see that nation, of recent origin, now among the most considerable and powerful, and spreading over the continent from sea to se.
"W Vestward the course of empire takes its way;
The four first acts already past,
A fifth shall close the drama.with the day,Time's noblest offspring is the last."
On the day of the Declaration of Independence, our illustrious fathrs
perforined the first scene in the last great act of this drama; one, in
real importance, infinitely exceeding that for which the great English
poet invoked
" A muse of fire,
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene."
The Muse inspiring our fathers was the Genius of Liberty, all on fire
with a sense of oppression, and a resolution to throw it off; the whole
world was the stage, and higher characters than princes trod it; and,
instead of monarchs, countries, and nations, and the age, beheld the
swelling scene. IHow well the characters were cast, and how well each
acted his part, and what emotions the whole performance excited, let
history, now and hereafter, tell.
On the Fourth of July, 1776, the representatives of the United
States of America, in Congress assembled, declared that these United
Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States.
This declaration, made by most patriotic and resolute men, trusting in
the justice of their cause, and the protection of Heaven, - and yet
made not without deep solicitude and anxiety, --has now stood for
seventy-five years, and still stands.  It was sealed in blood.  It has
met dangers, and overcome them; it has had enemies, and conquered
them; it has had detractors, and abashed them all; it has had doubting friends, but it has cleared all doubts away; and now, to-day, raising its august form higher than the clouds, twenty millions of people
contemplate it with hallowed love, and the world beholds it, and the
consequences which have followed from it, with prol-(und admiration.
This anniver:lrdly animates, and gladdens, and unites, all American
hearts.  On othetr days of the year we may be party men, indulging
in controversies more or less important to the' public good; we may
have likes and dislikes, and we may maintain our political differences,
o[len with warnm, and sometimes with angry feelings.  But to-day we
are Americans all; and all nothing but Americans.   As the great
luminary over our heads, dissipating mists and fogs, now cheers the
whole hemisphere, so do the associations connected with this day disperse all cloudy and sullen weather in the minds and feelings of true
Amnericans.  Every man's heart swells within him, every man's port
and bearing becomes somewhat more proud and lofty, as he remembers
that seventy-five years have rolled away, and that the great inheritance
of liberty is still his; his, undiminished and unimpaired; his, in all
its original glory; his to enjoy, his to protect, and his to tranamit to
future generations.POLITICAL AND OCCASIONAL. - WEBSTER.

X2. APOSTROPHE 71 0 WASHINGTON. - On the last-named occasion
FELLOW-CITIZENS: What contemplations are awakened in our minds
as we assemble here to reenact a scene like that performled by
WTashington! Methinks I see his venerable form now before me, a.
presented in the glorious statue by Houdon, now in the Capitol of
Virginia.  He is dignified and grave; but concern and anxiety seem
to soften the lineaments of his countenance.  The government over
which he presides is yet in the crisis of experiment.  Not free from
troubles at honme, he sees the world in commotion and arms all around
him. He sees that imposing foreign powers are half disposed to
try the strength of tile recently established American government.
Mighty thoughts, mingled with fears as well as with hopes, are struggling within him.  He heads a short procession over these then naked
fields; he crosses yonder stream on a fallen tree; he ascends to the
top of this eminence, whose original oaks of the forest stand as thick
around him as if the spot had been devoted to Druidical worship, andl
here he performs the appointed duty of the day.
And now, fellow-citizens, if this vision were a reality, - if Wash..
ington actually were now amongst us, - and if he could draw around
him the shades of the great public men of his own days, patriots and
warriors, orators and statesmen, and were to address us in their
presence, would he not say to us: "Ye men of this generation, I
rejoice and thank God for being able to see that our labors, and toils,
and sacrifices, were not in vain.   You are prosperous, you are
happy, you are grateful.   The fire of liberty burns brightly and
steadily in your hearts, while duty and the law restrain it from bursting forth in wild and destructive conflagration.  Cherish liberty, as
you love it; cherish its securities, as you wish to preserve it.  Maintain the Constitution which we labored so painfully to establish, and
which has been to you such a source of inestiinable blessings.  Preserve the Union of the States, cemented as it was by our prayers, our
tears and our blood.  Be true to God, to your country, and to your
duty.  So shall the whole Eastern world ibllow the morning sun, to
contemplate you as a nation; so shall all generations honor you, as
they honor us; and so shall that Almighty Power which so graciously
protected us, and which now protects you, shower its everlasting blessings upon you and your posterity! "
Great father of your country! we heed your words; we feel their
force, as if you now uttered them with lips of flesh and blood. Your
example teaches us, your affectionate addresses teach us, your public life teaches us, your sense of the value of the blessings of the
UIlion. Those blessings our fathers have tasted, and we have tasted,
and still taste. Nor do we intend that those who come after us shall
be denied the same high fruition. Our honor, as well as our happiness, is concerned.  We cannot, we dare not, we will not, betray our
sacred trust.  We will not filch from posterity the treasure placed in
our hands to be transmitted to other generations.  The bow that gild#THE STANDARD SPEAKER..
the cl(uds in the Iteavens, the pillars that uphold the firmament,
may disappear and fall away in the hour appointed by the will of
God; but, until that day comes, or so long as our lives may last, no
ruthless hand shall undermine that bright arch of Union and Liberty
which spans the continent from Washington to California!
23. THE POWER OF PUBLIC OPINION, 1852.- Webster
WE are too much inclined to underrate the power of moral influence, and the influence of public opinion, and the influence of principles to which great men, the lights of the world and of the age, nave
given their sanction. Who doubts that, in our own struggle for
liberty and independence, the majestic eloqu6nce of Chatham, the
profound reasoning of Burke, the burning satire and irony of CoL
Barre, had influences upon our fortunes here in America? They had
influences both ways. They tended, in the first place, somewhat to
diminish the confidence of the British Ministry in their hopes of
success, in attempting to subjugate an injured People. They had
influence another way, because, all along the coasts of the country,and all our people in that day lived upon the coast,- there was
not a reading man who did not feel stronger, bolder, and more determined in the assertion of his rights, when these exhilarating accounts
from the two Houses of Parliamlent reached him from beyond the
seas. ike felt that those who held and controlled public opinion elsewhere were with us; that their words of eloquence might produce an
effect in the region where they were uttered; and, above all, they
assured them that, in the judgment of the just, and the wise, and the
impartial, their cause was just, and they were right; and therefore
they said, We will fight it out to the last.
Now, Gentlemen, another great mistake is sometimes made. We
think that nothing is powerful enough to stand before autocratic,
Inonarchical, or despotic power.  There is something strong enough,
quite strong enough, - and, if properly exerted, will provo itself so,and that is the power of intelligent public opinion in all the Nations of
the earth. There is not a monarch on eartlh whose throne is not
liable to be shaken by the progress of opinion, and the sentiment of
the just and intelligent part of the People. It becomes us, in the
station which we hold, to let that public opinion, so far as we form it,
have a free course. Let it go out; let it be pronounced in thunder
tones; let it open the ears of the deaf; let it open the eyes of the
blind; and let it everywhere be proclaimed wha.t we of this great
lepublic think of the general principle of human liberty, and of that
oppression which all abhor. Depend upon it, Gentlemen, that between
these two rival powers, - the autocratic power, maintained by arms and
torce, and the popular power, maintained by opinioni - the former is
constantly decreasing, and, thank God, the latter is constantly increasing! Real human liberty and human rights are gaining the ascendant; and the part which we have to act, in all this great drama, is to
394AND OCCASIONAL. -. KING.
show ourselves in'Tavor of those rights, to uphold cur ascenaency, and
to carry it on until we shall see it culminate in the highest H.eaver
voer our heads.
24. THE FUTURE OF THE UNITED STATES. -President King.
I HAVE faith in the future, because I have confidence in the present.
With our growth in wealth and in power, I see no abatement in those
qualities, moral and physical, to which so much of our success is owing;
and, while thus true to ourselves, true to the instincts of freedom, and
to those other instincts which, with our race, seem to go hand in hand
with Freedom, - love of order and respect for law (as law, and not
because it is upheld by force),- we must continue to prosper.
The sun shines not upon, has never shonre upon, a land where
human happiness is so widely disseminated, where human government
is so little abused, so free fibm oppression, so invisible, intangible, and
yet so strong. Nowhere else do the institutions which constitute a
State rest upon so broad a base as here; and nowhere are men so
powerless, and institutions so strong.  In,the wilderness of free minds,
dissensions will occur; and, in the unlimited discussion in writing and
in speech, in town-meetings, newspapers, and legislative bodies, angry
and menacing language will be used; irritations will arise and be
aggravated; and those immediately concerned in the strife, or breathing its atmosphere, may fear, or feign to fear, that danger is in such
hot breath and passionate resolves.. But outside, and above, and beyond
all this, is the People, - steady, industrious, self-possessed, - caring
little for abstractions, and less for abstractionists, but, with one deep,
common sentiment, and with the consciousness, calm, but quite sure
and earnest, that, in the Constitution and the Union, as they received
them from their fathers, and as they themselves have observed and
maintained them, is the sheet-anchor of their hope, the pledge of their
prosperity, the palladium of their liberty; and with this, is that other
consciousness, not less calm and not less earnest, that, in their own
keeping exclusively, and not in that of any party leaders, or party
demagogues, or political hacks, or speculators, is the integrity of that
Union and that Constitution.  It is in the strong arms and honest
hearts of the great masses, who are not members of Congress, nor
holders of office, nor spouters at town-meetings, that resides the safety
of the State; and these masses, though slow to move, are irresistible,
when the time and the occasion for moving come.
I have faith, therefore, in the Future; and when, at the close of
this half-century, which so comparatively few of us are to see, the
account shall again be taken, and the question be asked, What has
New York done since 1850? I have fahith that the answer will be
given in a City still advancing in population, wealth, morals, and
knowledge, -.in a City free, and deserving, by her virtues, her benevolent institutions, her schools, her courts and her temples, to continue
free, and still part and parcel of this great and glorious Union,--
which mav God preserve till Time shall be no more!
395THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
25' IMPORTANCE OF THE AGRICULTURAL INTEREST.--Calel Cush,tg
THESE United States are, as a whole, and always have been, chiefly
dependent, for their wealth and power, on the natural productions of
the earth.  It is the spontaneous products of our forests, our mines,
ard our seas, and the cultivated products of our soil, which have made,
and continue to make, us what we are.  MIanufacture can but modify
these, commerce only distribute or accumulate themr, and exchange
them  for others, to gratify taste, or promote convenience.  Land is
the footstool of our power; land is the throne of our empire.
Generation after generation may give themselves up to slaughter,
in civil or foreign war; dynasty follow dynasty, each with new varieties of oppression or misrule; the fratricidal rage of domestic factions
rend the entrails of their common country; temples, and basilica, and
capitols, crumble to dust; proud navies melt into the yeast of the
sea; and all that Art fitfully does to perpetuate itself disappear like
the phantasm of a troublecl dream; - but Nature is everlasting; and,
above the wreck and uproar of our vain devices and childish tumults,
the tutelary stars continue to sparkle on us from their distant spheres;
the sun to pour out his vivifying rays of light and heat over the earth,
the elements to dissolve, in grateful rain; the majestic river to roll on
his fertilizing waters unceasingly; and the ungrudging soil to yield
up the plenteousness of its harvest, year after year, to the hand of the
husbandman.   He, the husbandman, is the servant of those divine
elements of earth and air; he is the nminister of that gracious, that
benign, that bounteous, that fostering, that nourishing, that renovating, that inexhaustible, that adorable Nature; and, as such, the stewardship of our nationality is in him.
26. EUROPEAN STRUGGLES FOR FREEDOM, 1848.-Reverdy Johnson.
AmIDsT the agitating throes of the Old World, - amidst the fall
of Thrones, the prostrationl of Dynasties, the flight of Kings,what American, native or naturalized, lives, who does not admire and
love his Government, and is not prepared to die in its defence?  Our
power, and our unexampled private and public prosperity, are to be
referred altogether to our Constitutional liberty.  Can it be wondered
at, that, with such an example before them, the Nations of Europe
should be striking for freedom? Sooner or later, the blow was inevitable. Absolute individual liberty, secured by the power of all; private rights of person and property held sacred, and maintained by the
will and power of all; perfect equality of all; absence of degrading
inferiority; each standing on a common platform; no selected Lords
nor Sovereigns, by election or by birth, but every honest man a Lord
and a Sovereign, - constitutes a proud and glorious contrast, challenging, and. sooner or later, certain to obtain, the applause, admiration,
and adoption of the world.
Appail ntly sudden and unexpected as have been these great pppular struggles, with which we are sympathizing, they were as certain
396POLITICAL AND OCCASIONAL. - CHOATE.
to occur as the revolution of the seasons.  To be free, man needs only
to know the value of freedom.  To east off the shackles of tyranny,
he needs only to know his power.  The result is inevitable.  But the
People of the Old World must also learn that liberty, unrestrained, is
dangerous licentiousness.  Of all conditions in which man may be
placed, anarchy is the most direful.  All history teaches that the
tyranny of the many is more fatal than the tyranny of the few. The
liberty suited to man's nature is liberty restrained by law. This,
too, they may learn from our example.  In sending, then, our sincere
congratulations to the People of the Continent, we should advise them
against every popular excess.  In a fraternal spirit, we should invoke
them to a reign of order, of their own creation, - a reign of just law,
of their own enactment, - a reign of Constitutional freedom, of their
own granting. Then will their liberty be as our own, full and perfect,
securing all the blessings of human life, and giving to every People
everything of power and true glory which should belong to a civilized
and Christian Nation.
27. THE BIRTII-DAY OF WASHINGTON. -Rufus Choate.
THE birth-day of the " Father of his Country "! May it ever be
freshly remembered by American hearts! May it ever re'dwaken in
them a filial veneration for his memory; ever rekindle the fires of
patriotic regard to the country which he loved so well; to which he
gave his youthful vigor and his youthful energy, during the perilous
period of the early Indian warfare; to which he devoted his life, in
the maturity of his powers, in the field; to vhich again he offered the
counsels,of his wisdom and his experience, as President of the Convention that framed our Constitution; which he guided and directed
while in the Chair of State, and for which the last prayer of his
earthly supplication was offered up, when it came the moment for him
so well, and so grandly, and so calmly, to die. He was the first man
of the time in which he grew. His memory is first and most sacred
in our love; and ever hereafter, till the last drop of blood shall freeze
in the last American heart, his name shall be a spell of power and
might.
Yes, Gentlemen, there is one personal, one vast felicity, which no man
can share with him.   It was the daily beauty and towering and
matchless glory of his life, which enabled him to create his country,
and, at the same time, secure an undying love and regard from the
whole American people.   "The first in the hearts of his countrymen!"   Yes, first!  He has our first and most fervent love.  Undoubtedly there were brave and wise and good men, before his day, in
every colony. But the American Nation, as a Nation, I do not reckon
to have begun before 1774. And the first love of that young America
was Wnashington.  The first word she lisped was his name. Her
earliest biea,th spoke it  It still is her proud ejaculation; and it will
be the last gasp of her expmrlng life!

2. IMMORTALITY. - Original Translation from Alassillon.
JEAN BAPTISTE MASSILLON, one of the most eloquent preachers of any age, was born in Pro:ence, France, in 1663. He became so celebrated for his eloquence, that he was called to Paris,
Ahere he drew crowds of hearers. In 1717, he was made Bishop of Clermont; and died, 1742.
IF we wholly perish with the body, what an imposture is this whole
system of laws, manners and usages, on which human society is founded!
If we wholly perish with the body, these maxims of charity, patience,
jwtice, honor, gratitude and friendship, which sages have taught and
good men have practised, what are they but empty words, possessing
no real and binding efficacy? Why should we heed them, if in this lifb
oniy we have hope?  Speak not of duty.  What can we owe to the
dead, to the living, to ourselves, if all are, or will be, nothing? Who
shall dictate our duty, if not our own pleasures, - if not our own
passions? Speak not of morality. It is a mere chimera, a bugbear
of human invention, if retribution terminate with the grave.
If we must wholly perish, what to us are the sweet ties of kindred?
what the tender names of parent, child, sister, brother, husband, wife,
or friend?  The characters of a drama are not more illusive  We
have no ancestors, no descendants; since succession cannot be predicated of nothingness.  Would we honor the illustrious dead?  How
absurd to honor that which has no existence! Would we take thought
for posteritv?  How frivolous to concern ourselves for those whose
end, like our own, must soon be annihilation!   Have we made a
promise?  How can it bind nothing to nothing?  Perjury is but a
jest.  The last injunctions of the dying, -what sanctity have they,
more than the last sound of a chord that is snapped, of an instrument that is broken?
To sum up all: If we must wholly perish, then is obedience to the
laws but an insensate servitude; rulers and magistrates are but tle
phantoms which popular imbecility has raised up; justice is an unwarrantable infringement upon the liberty of men, - an imposition, an
usurpation; the law of marriage is a vain scruple; modesty, a prejudice; honor and probity, such stuff as dreams are made of; and
incests, murders, parricides, the most heartless cruelties, and the blackest crimes, are but the legitimate sports of man's irresponsible nature;
while the harsh epithets attached to them are merely such as the
policy of legislators has invented, and imposed on the credulity of the
people.
Here is the issue to which the vaunted philosophy of unbelieveri
nmust inevitably lead.  Here is that social felicity, that sway of reason, that emancipation from error, of which they eternally prate, as
the fruit of their doctrines. Accept their maxims, and the whole
world falls back into a friglltful chaos; and all the re]ations of life
are confounded; and all ideas of vice and virtue are reversed; and
the most inviolable laws of society vanish; and all moral discipline
perishes; and the government of states and nations has no longer
any cement to uphold it; and all the harmony of the body politic

28. THE PROSPECTS OF. CALIFORNIA, Nov. 2, 1850. -Nathaniel Bennett.
JUDGING from the past, what have we not a right to expect in the
future.  The world has never witnessed anything equal or similar to
our career hitherto. Scarcely two years ago, California was almost
an unoccupied wild. With the exception of a presidio, a mission, a
pueblo, or a lonely ranch, scattered here and there, at tiresome distances, there was nothing to show that the uniform stillness had ever
been broken by the footsteps of civilized man. The agricultural richness of her valleys remained unimproved; and the wealth of a world
lay entombed in the bosom of her solitary mountains, and on the
banks of her unexplored streams. Behold the contrast! The hand
of agriculture is now busy in every fertile valley, and its toils are
remunerated with rewards which in no other portion of the world can
be credited. Enterprise has pierced every hill, for hidden treasure,
and has heaped up enormous gains. Cities and villages dot the surFace of the whole State.  Steamers dart along our rivers, and innumerable vessels spread their white wings over our bays. Not Constantinople, upon which the wealth of imperial Rome was lavished,
-not St. Petersburg, to found which the arbitrary Czar sacrificed
thousands of his subjects, - would rival, in rapidity of growth, the fair
city which lies before me. Our State is a marvel to ourselves, and a
miracle to the rest of the world. Nor is the influence of California
tonfincd within her own borders.  Mexico, and the islands nestled in
the embrace of the Pacific, have felt the quickening breath of her
enterprise. With her golden wand, she has touched the prostrate
corpse of South American industry, and it has sprung up in the fresh2ess of life. Shp has caused the hum of busy life to be heard in the

wilderness " where rolls the Oregon," and but recently heard no
sculnd. "save his own dashings."  Even the wall of Chinese exclusiveness has been broken down, and the Ch:ildren of the Sun have
come forth to view the splendor of her achievements.
But, flattering as has been the past, satisfactory as is the present, it
is but a foretaste of the future.  It is a trite saying, that we live in
an age of great events.  Nothing can be more true. But the greatest
of all events of the present age is at hand.  It needs not the gift of
prophecy to predict, that the course of the world's trade is destined
soon to be changed.  But a few years can elapse before the commerce
of Asia and the Islands of the Pacific, instead of pursuing the ocean
track, by way of Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope, or even
taking the shorter route of the Isthmus of Darien or the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec, will enter the Golden Gate of California, and deposit its
riches in the lap of our own city.  Hence, on bars of iron, and propelled by steam, it will ascend the mountains and traverse the desert;
and, having again reached the confines of civilization, will be distributed, through a thousand channels, to every portion of the Union and
of Europe.  New York will then become what London now is, the
great central point of exchlange, the heart of trade, the force of
whose contraction and expansion will be felt throughout every artery
of the commercial world; and San Francisco will then stand the
second city of America.   Is this visionary?  Twenty years will
determine.
The world is interested in our success; for a fresh field is opened to
its commerce, and a new avenue to the civilization and progress of the
human race.   Let us, then, endeavor to realize the hopes of Americans, and the expectations of the world.  Let us not only be united
amongst ourselves, for our own local welfare, but let us strive to
=ement the common bonds of brotherhood of the whole Union.   In
our relations to the Federal Government, let us know no South, no
North, no East, no West.  Wherever American liberty flourishes, let
that be our common country' Wherever the American banner waves,
let, that be our home'

Tjivy! And, let me say, Gentlemen, that if we, and our posterity,
shall be true to the Christian religion,-- if we and they shall live
always in the fear of God, and shall respect His commandments, - if
we and they shall maintain just moral sentiments, and such conscientious convictions of duty as shall control the heart and life,--we
may have the highest hopes of the future fortunes of our country.
And, if we maintain those institutions of government, and that politieal Union --exceeding all. praise as much as it exceeds all former

examples of political associations, -we may be sure of one thing.
thlat while our country furnishes materials for a thousand masters ot
i.he historic art, it will afford no topic for a Gibbon.  It will have no
Decline and Fall.  It will go on, prospering and to prosper.  But, if
we and our posterity reject religious instruction and autllority, violdte
the rules of eternal justice, trifle with the injunctions of morality, alld
recklessly destroy the political Constitution which holds us together,
no man can tell how suddenly a catastrophe may overwhelm us that
shall bury all our glory in profound obscurity. If that catastrophe
shall happen, let it have no history! Let the horrible narrative never
be written; let its fate be like that of the lost books of Livy, which
no human eye shall ever read, or the missing Pleiad, of which no man
can ever know more than that it is lost, and lost forever.
But, Gentlemen, I will not take my leave of you in a tone of despondency. We may trust that Heaven will not forsake us, so long as
we do not forsake ourselves. Are we of this generation so derelict -
have we so little of the blood of our Revolutionary fathers coursing
through our veins --that we cannot preserve what our ancestors
achieved?  The world will cry out " SHAME " upon us, if we show
ourselves unworthy to be the descendants of those great and illuo
trious men who fought for their liberty, and secured it to their posterity by the Constitution.
The Constitution has enemies, secret and professed; but they cannot
disguise the fact that it secures us many benefits. These enemies are
unlike in character, but they all have some fault to find.  Some of
them are enthusiasts, hot-headed, self-sufficient and headstrong. They
fancy that they can make out for themselves a better path than that
laid down for them.  Phaeton, the son of Apollo, thought he could
find a better course across the Heavens for the sun.
"Thus PhaSton once, amidst the ethereal plains,
Leaped on his father's car, and seized the reins;
Far from his course impelled the glowing sun,'Till Nature's laws to wild disorder run."
Other enemies there are, more cool, and with more calculation
These have a deeper and more traitorous purpose. They have spoken
of forcible resistance to the provisions of the Constitution; they now
speak of Secession! Let me say, Gentlemen, secession from us is
accession elsewhere.  He who renounces the protection of the Stars
and Stripes shelters himself under the shadow of another flag, you
may rest assured of that.  Now, to counteract the efforts of these
malecontents, the friends of the Constitution must rally.  ALL its
friends, of whatever section, whatever their sectional opinions may be,
must unite for its preservation.  To that standard we must adhere,
and uphold it through evil report and good report.  We will sustain
it, and meet death itself, if it come; we will ever encounter and defeat
error, by day and by night, in light or in darkness - thick darkness,--
if it come, till
" Danger's troubled night is o'er,
And the star ol Peace return."

And woe to thee, resplendent shrine, -

On marble towers and roofs of gold:

A dazzling ring, round Pharaoh's Throne.

Shrank backward from his stately stride:
His cheek with storm and time was tanmned;
A shepherd's staff was in his hand.
A shudder of instinctive fear
Told the dark King what step was nearl

He clasped not sandal, kissed not Thrmone;

And the great Southern Cross meets his terrified eyes;

4. DESTRUCTION OF THE PHILISTINES. -Milton.
It has been said of the following passage, that "the poet seems to exert no less force af ais- u
bi describing, than Samson does strength of body in executing."
OccAsIoNs drew me early to the city;
And, as the gates I entered with sunrise,
The morning trumpets festival proclaimed
Through each high street; little I had despatched,
When all abroad was rumored that this day
Samson should be brought forth, to show the People
Proof of his mighty strength in feats and games  
I sorrowed at his captive state, but minded
Not to be absent at that spectacle.
The building was a spacious theatre
Half round, on two main pillars vaulted high,
With seats where all the lords, and each degree
Of sort, might sit, in order to behold;
The other side was open, where the throng
On banks and scaffolds under sky might stand;
I among these aloof obscurely stood.
The feast and noon grew high, and sacrifice
Had filled their hearts with mirth, high cheer, and wine,
When to their sports they turned. Immediately
Was Samson as a public servant brought,
In their state livery clad; before him pipes,
And timbrels, - on each side went armed guards,
Both horse and foot, - before him and behind,
Arcbers, and slingers, cataphracts * and spears.
At sight of him, the People with a shout
Rifted the air, clamoring their god with praise,
Who had made their dreadful enemy their thrall.
He, patient, but undaunted, where they led him,
Came to the place; and what was set before him,
Which without help of eye might be essayed,
To heave, pull, draw or break,, he still performed
All with incredible, stupendous force;
None daring to appear antagonist.
At length, for intermission sake, they led him
Between the pillars; he his guide requested
(For so from such as nearer stood we heard),
As over-tired, to let him lean a while

Of reckless barbarians, shameless, remorseless, brutal, denaturalized,
with no other law than force, no other check than passion, no other
bond than irreligion, no other God than self!  Such would be the
world which impiety would make. Such would be this world, were

3. THE UTILITY OF THE BEAUTIFUL.--John Ruskin.
MAN'S use and function--and let him who will not grant me
this follow me no further- is to be the witness of the glory of God,
and to advance that glory by his reasonable obedience and resultant
happiness. Whatever enables us to fulfil this function is, in the pure
nmd first sense of the word, useful to us. And yet people speak, in
this working age, as if houses, and lands, and food, and raiment, were
alone useful; and, as if sight, thought and admiration, were all profit
less: so that men insolently call themselves Utilitarians, who would
turn, if they had their way, themselves and their race into vegetables;
men who think, as far as such can be said to think, that the meat is
more than the life, and the raiment than the body; who look to the
earth as a stable, and to its fruit as fodder; vine-dressers and husbandmen, who love the corn they grind, and the grapes they crush,
better than the gardens of the angels upon the slopes of Eden; hewers
of wood and drawers of water, who think that the wood they hew, and
the water they draw, are better than the pine-forests that cover the
mountains like the shadow of God, and than the great rivers that move
like His eternity. And so comes upon us that woe of the preacher,
that though God " hath made everything beautiful in his time, also
He hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the
work that God maketh from the beginning to the end."
This Nebuchadnezzar curse, that sends us to grass like oxen, seems
to follow but too closely on the excess or continuance of national power
and peace. In the perplexities of nations, in their struggles for existence,- in their infancy, their impotence, or even their disorganization,
- they have higher hopes and nobler passions.  Out of the suffering
comes the serious mind; out of the salvation, the grateful heart; out
of the endurance, the fortitude; out of the deliverance, the faith.
Deep though the causes of thankfulness must be to every people at
peace with others and at unity in itself, there are causes of fear also,a fear greater than of sword and sedition, - that dependence on Gri
may be forgotten, because the bread is given and the water is sure'
that gratitude to Him may cease, because His constancy of protection
has taken the semblance of a natural law; that heavenly hope may
grow faint amidst the full fruition of the world; that selfishness may
take place of undemanded devotion, compassion be lost in vain-glory.

That to the arhe'd roof gave main support.
He, unsuspi0:ous, led him; which when Samson
Felt in his arms, with head a while inclined,
And eyes fast fixed he stood, as one who prayed,
Or some great matter in his mind revolved:
At last, with head erect, thus cried aloud: -
" Hitherto, Lords, what your commands imposed
I have performed, as reason was, obeying,
Not without wonder or delight beheld;
Now of my own accord such other trial
I mean to show you of my strength, yet greater,
As with amaze shall strike all who behold."
This uttered, straining all his nerves, he bowed:
As with the force of winds and waters pent,
When mountains tremble, those two massy pillars
With horrible convulsion to and fro
He tugged, he shook, till down they came, anqd drew
The whole roof after them, with burst of thunder
Upon the heads of all who sat beneath,
Lords, ladies, captains, counsellors, or priests,
Their choice nobility and flower, not only
Of this, but each Philistian city round,
net from all parts to solemnize this feast.
Samson, with these immixed, inevitably
Pulled down the same destruction on himself;
The vulgar only'scaped, who stood without.

Thy miscreated front athwart my way
To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass

And they, outcast from God, are here condemned
To waste eternal days in woe and pain?
And reckon'st thou thyself with spirits of Heaven,

Where I reign king, and, to enrage thee more
Thy king and lord! Back to thy punishment,
False fugitive! and to thy speed add wings;
Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue
Thy lingering, or with one stroke of this dart
Strange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before."
So spake the grisly terror; and in shape,
So speaking, and so threatening, grew ten-fold
Mlore dreadful and deform: on the other side,
Incensed with indignation, Satan stood
Unterrified, and like a comet burned,
That fires the length of Ophiuichus huge
In the Arctic sky, and from his horrid hair
Shakes pestilence and war. Each at the head
Levelled his deadly aim; their fatal hands
No second stroke intend; and such a frown
Each cast at the other, as when two black clouds,
With Heaven's artillery fraught, come rattling on
Over the Caspian; then stand front to front
Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow
To join their dark encounter in mid air:
So frowned the mighty combatants, that hell
Grew darker at their frown; so matched they stood;
For never but once more was either like
To meet so great a Foe: and now great deeds
Jad been achieved, whereof all hell had rung,
Had not the snaky sorceress that sat
Fast by hell-gate, and kept the fatal key,
Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed between.

Why dost thou start, with livid cheek? - - why fling
The untasted goblet from thy trembling hand?
Why shake thy joints, thy feet forget to stand?
Why roams thine eye, which seems in wild amaze
To shun some object, yet returns to gaze, -
Then shrinks again appalled, as if the tomb
HIad sent a spirit from its inmost gloom?
Awful the horror, when Belshazzar raised
His arm, and pointed where the vision blazed!
For see! enrobed in flame, a mystic shade,
As of a hand, a red right-hand, displayed!
And, slowly moving o'er the wall, appear
Letters of fate, and characters of fear.
In deathlike silence grouped, the revellers all
Fix their glazed eyeballs on the illumined wall.
See! now the vision brightens,--now'tis gone,
Like meteor flash, like Heaven's own lightning flown!
But, though the hand hath vanished, what it writ
Is uneffaced. Who will interpret it?
In vain the sages try their utmost skill;
The mystic letters are unconstrued still.
"Quick, bring the Prophet!- let his tongue proclaim
The mystery of that visionary flame."
The holy Prophet came, and stood upright,
With brow serene, before Belshazzar's sight.
The monarch pointed trembling to the wall:
" Behold the portents that our healt appall!
Interpret tlhem, O Prophet! thou shalt know
What gifts Assyria's monarch can bestow."
Unutterably awful was the eye
Which met the monarch's; and the stern reply
Fell heavy on his soul: "Thy gifts withhold,
Nor tempt the Spirit of the Law, with gold.
Belshazzar, hear what these dread words reveal!
That lot on which. the Eternal sets his seal.
Thy kingdom numnbered, and thy glory flown,
The Mede and Persian revel on thy throne.
Weighed in the balance, thou hast kicked the beam9;
See to yon Western sun the lances gleam,
Which, ere his Orient rays adorn the sky,
Thy blood shall sully with a crimson dye."

7. BERNARDO DEL CARPIO.--lMrs. Hemans
The celebrated Spanish champion, Bernardo del Carpio, having made many ineffectual efforts
to procure the release of his father, the Count Saldana, who had been imprisoned, by King
Alphonso of Asturias, almost from the time of Bernardo's birth, at last took up arms, in dlespair.
The war which he maintained proved so destructive, that the men of the land gathered round
the king, and united in demanding Saldana's liberty. Alphonso accordingly offered Bernar(do
inlmediate possession of his father's person, in exchange for his castle of Carpio. Bernaido,
without hesitation, gave up his strong-hold with all his captives; and, being assured that his
father was then on his way from prison, rode forth with the king to meet him. " And when
he saw his'father approaching, he exclaimed," says the ancient chronicle, "'0 O, God! is the
Count of Saldana inldeed coming?''Look where he is,' replied the cruel king,'and now go
and greet him, whom you have so long desired to see.'" The remainder of the story will bo
found related in the ballad. The chronicles and romances leave us nearly in the dark as to Bernardo's history after this event.
THE warrior bowed his crested head, and tamed his heart of fire,
And sued the haughty king to free his long-imprisoned sire;
"I bring thee here my fortress-keys, I bring my captive train,
I pledge thee faith, my liege, my lord! -- 0! break my father's
chain! "
" Rise, rise! even now thy father comes, a ransomed man, this day!
Mgunt thy good horse; and thou and I will meet him on his way."
Then lightly rose that loyal son, and bounded on his steed,
And urged, as if with lance in rest, the charger's foamy speed.
And lo! from far, as on they pressed, there came a glittering band,
With one that'midst them stately rode, as a leader in the land:
" Now haste, Bernardo, haste! for there, in very truth, is he,
The father whom thy faithful heart hath yearned so long to see."
His dark eye flashed, his proud breast heaved, his cheek's hue came
and went;
He reached that gray-haired chieftain's side, and there, dismounting,
bent;
A lowly knee to earth he bent, his father's hand he tookWhat was there in its touch that all his fiery spirit shook?
That hand was cold, -   a frozen thing, -  it dropped from his like lead  
He looked up to the face above,-     the face was of the dead!
A plume waved o'er the noble brow, - the brow was fixed and white.
Hle met, at last, his father's eyes, - but in them was no sight!
Up from   the ground he sprang and gazed;- but who could paint that
gaze?
They hushed their very hearts, that saw its horror and amaze:--
They might have chained him, as before that stony form he stood;
For the power was stricken from his arm, and from his lip the blood.
"Father! " at length he murmured low, and wept like childhood th-In

lie thought on all his glorious hopes, and all his young renown, -
He fltng his falchion from his side, and in the dust sat down.
Then covering with his steel-gloved hands his darkly mournful brow,
" No more, there is no more," he said, " to lift the sword for, now,
My king is false,- my hope betrayed! My father     O! the wortlt
The glory, and the loveliness, are passed away from earth!
"I' thought to stand where banners waved, my sire, beside thee, yet!
I would that there our kindred blood on Spain's free soil had met!
Thou wouldst have known my spirit, then;-- for thee my fields were
won;
Anld thou hast perished in thy chains, as though thou hadst no son!"
Then, starting from the ground once more, he seized the monarch's
rein,
Amidst the pale and wildered looks of all the courtier train;
And, with a fierce, o'ermastering grasp, the rearing war-horse led,
And sternly set them face to face,- the king before the dead: -
" Came I not forth, upon thy pledge, my father's hand to kiss?
- Be still, and gaze thou on, false king! and tell me what is this?
The voice, the glance, the heart I sought,- give answer, where are
they?
- If thou wouldst clear thy perjured soul, send life through this cold
clay!
"Into these glassy eyes put light; - be still! keep down thine ire!Bid these white lips a blessing speak, - this earth is not my sire: -
Give me back him for whom I strove, for whom my blood was shed -
Thou canst not? - and a king! - his dust be mountains on thy head!
He loosed the steed, - his slack hand fell; - upon the silent face
He cast one long, deep, troubled look, then turned from that sad place:
His hope was crushed, his after fate untold in martial strain:His banner led the spears no more, amidst the hills of Spain.
8. CASABIANCA. -Mrs. Hemans.
Young Casabianca, a boy about thirteen years old, son to the Admiral of the Orient, remained
at his post (in the battle of the Nile) after the ship had taken fire, and all the guns had beer
abandoned: and perished in the explosion of the vessel, when the flames had reached the powder.
TIIE boy stood on the burning deck, whence all but he had fled;
The flame that lit the battle's wreck shone round him o'er the dead.
Yet beautiful and bright he stood, as born to rule the storm. -
A creature of heroic blood, a proud, though child-like form.
The flaines rolled on - he would not go, without his Father's word;
That Father, faint in death below, his voice no longer heard.
He called aloud: --" Say, Father, say, if yet my task is done? "

While o'er him fast, through sail and shroud, the wreathing fires made

And imusic in the southern wind, and sunshine on the vines.

The Isles of Greece, the Hills of Spain, the purple Heavens of Rome,

For thine the Sabbath peace, my land! and thine the guarded hearth;
And thine the dead, the noble band, that make thee holy earth.

Fringed with the violet, eolqred with the skies!

Under young leaves that shook with melodies.

Seem with soft links to draw the wanderer back.

Sits by the hearth with meekly thoughtful eye;
There my young sisters watch to greet their brother -
Soon their glad footsteps down the path will fly.
There, in sweet strains of kindred music blending,
All the home-voices meet at day's decline;
One are those tones, as from one heart ascending:
There laughs my home, - sad stranger! where is thine? -
Ask'st thou of mine? - In solemn peace't is lying,
Far o'er the deserts and the tombs away;'T is where I; too, am loved with love undying,
Ancl fond hearts wait my step. - But where are they?
Ask where the earth's departed have their dwelling:
Ask of the clouds, the stars, the trackless air!
I know it not, yet trust the whisper, telling
My lonely heart that love unchanged is there.
And what is home and where, but with the loving?  
Happy thou art, that so canst gaze on t;hine!
My spirit feels but, in its weary roving,
That with the dead, where'er they be, is mine.
Go to thy home, rejoicing son and brother!
Bear in fresh gladness to the household scene!
For me, too, watch the sister and the mother,
I will believe -but dark seas roll between.

ANswER me, burning stars of night! where is the spirit gone,
That past the reach of human sight as a swift breeze hath flown --
And the stars answered me, "We roll in light and power on high;
But, of the never-dying soul, ask that which cannot die."
O! many-toned and chainless wind! thou art a wanderer free;
Tell me if thou its place canst find, far over mount and sea? -
And the wind murmured, in reply, " The blue deep I have crossea,
And imet its barks and billows high, biut not what thou hast lost."
Ye clouds that gorgeously repose around the setting sun,
Answer! have ye a home for those wlose earthly race is rurn?The bright clouds answered, "We depart, we vanish from the sky;
Ask what is deatlless in thy heart for that which cannot die."
Speak, then, thou voice of God within, tlhou of the deep, low tone!
Answer me through life's restless din, where is the spirit flown? -

12. LOCHINVAR.--Sir Walter Scott.
0. YOrNT Lochinvar is come out of the West,Through all the wide Border his steed was the best;
And save his good broadsword he weapons had none,
He rode all unarmed and he rode all alone.
So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,
There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.
He staid not for brake, and he stopped not for stone,
He swam the Eske river where ford there was none;
But ere he alighted at Netherby gate,
The bride had consented, the gallant came late:
For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,
Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.
So boldly he entered the Netherby hall,'Mong bride's-men, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all.
Then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword
(Foi the poor craven bridegroom said never a word),
" O, come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,
Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?"
"I long wooed your daughter,--my suit you denied;Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide;
And now am I come, with this lost love of mine,
To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.
There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,
That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar."
The bride kissed the goblet; the -knight took it up,
He quaffed off the wine, and he threw down the cup.
She looked down to blush, and she looked up to sigh,
With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.
Fie took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,--
"Now tread we a measure! " said young Lochinvar
So stately his form, and:so lovely her face,
That never a hall such a galliard did grace;
While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,
And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume
And the bridemaidens whispered, "'Twere better, by far.
To have matched our fair cousin with young Lochinvar."
One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,
When they reached the hall door, and the charger stood nean
So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,
So light to the saddle before her he sprung!

TEuE train from out the castle drew;
But Marmion stopped to bid adieu:"Though something I might'plain," he said,
"Of cold respect to stranger guest,
Sent hither by your King's behest,
While in Tantallon's towers I stayed,Part we in friendship from your land,
And, noble Earl, receive my hand."
But Douglas round him drew his cloak,
Folded his arms, and thus he spoke:-' My manors, halls and bowers, shall still
Be open, at my sovereign's will,
To each one whom he lists, howe'er
Unmeet to be the owner's peer.
My castles are my King's alone,
From turret to foundation-stone;The hand of Douglas is his own;
And never shall in friendly grasp
The hand of such as Marmion clasp! "
Burned Marmion's swarthy cheek like fire,
And shook his very frame for ire,
And-" This to me!" he said;
" An't were not for thy hoary beard,
Such hand as Marmion's had not spareG
To cleave the Douglas' head!
And first I tell thee, haughty Peer,
He who does England's message here,
Although the meanest in her state,
May well, proud Angus, be thy mate!
And, Douglas, more I tell thee here,
Even in thy pitch of pride,
Here, in thy hold, thy vassals near
(Nay, never look upon your Lord,
And lay your hands upon your sword!),
I tell thee, thou'rt defied!
And if thou saidst I am not peer
To any lord in Scotland here,
Lowland or Highland, far or near,
Lord Angus, thou hast lied! "

O'ercame the ashen hue of age;

To beard the lion in his den,The Douglas in his hall?
Ana hopest thou hence unscathed to go?
No, by Saint Bride of Bothwell, no!
Up drawbridge, grooms! - what, warder, ho!
Let the portcullis fall."
Lord Marmion turned, - well was his need. -
And dashed the rowels in his steed;
Like arrow through the archway sprung,
The ponderous gate behind him rung:
To pass; there was such scanty room,
The bars, descending, razed his plume.
The steed along the drawbridge flies,
Just as it trembled on the rise:
Not lighter does the swallow skim
Along the smooth lake's level brim:
And when Lord Marmion reached his band,
He halts, and turns with clenched hand,
A shout of loud defiance pours,
And shakes his gauntlet at the towers!

Two horsemen, drenched with gore,
And in their arms, a helpless load,
A wounded knight they bore.
His hand still strained the broken brand,
His arms were smeared with blood and sand

With dinted shield and helmet beat,
The falcon-crest and plumage gone, -

4. THE WORLD WITIIOUT AND WITHIN.--Thomas Noon Talfourd.
EXISTENCE has become almost a different thing since it began with
some of us. It then justified its old similitude of a journey, - it quickened with intellect into a march; it is now whirling with science and
specllation into a flight. Space is contracted and shrivelled up like a
scroll.  Time disdains its old relations to distance.  The intervals
between the "flighty purpose" and the "deed" are almost annihilated; and the national mind must either glow with generous excitement, or waste in fitful fever. fHow important, then, is it, that
throughout our land the spiritual agencies should be quickened into
klndred activity; that the few minutes of leisure and repose which
may be left us should, by the succession of those "thoughts which
wander through eternity," become hours of that true time which is
dialled in Heaven; that thought, no longer circling in vapid dream,
but impelled right onward with divine energy, should not only outspeed the realized miracles of steam, but the divinest visions of atmospheric prophecy, and still " keep the start of the majestic world"!
Mr. Canning once boasted, of his South American policy, that he
had " called a new world into existence, to balance the old."  Be it
your nobler endeavor to preserve the balance even between the world
within us and the world without us; not vainly seeking to retard the
life of action, but to make it steady by Contemplation's immorta.

Hath waked the dwelling of the dead!
Fresh sod, and old sepulchral stone,
Return the tramp in varied tone.
All eyes upon the gateway hung,
When through the Gothic arch there sprung
A horseman armed, at headlong speed -
Sable his cloak, his plume, his steed.
Fire from the flinty floor was spurned,
The vaults unwonted clang returned! -
One instant's glance around he threw,
From saddle-bow his pistol drew.
Grimly determined was his look!
His charger with the spurs he strook,.All scattered backward as he came,
For all knew Bertram Risingham!
Three bounds that noble courser gave;
The first has reached the central nave,
The second cleared the chancel wide,
The third he was at Wycliffe's side!
Full levelled at the Baron's head,
Rang the report, - the bullet sped,And to his long account, and last,
Without a groan, dark O)swald past.4'19.NARRATIVE AND LB'RICAL.- SCOTT.
All was so quick, that it might seem
A flash of lightning, or a dream.
While yet the smoke tfie deed conceals,
Bertram his ready charger wheels;
But floundered on the pavement floor
The steed, and down the rider bore,
And bursting in the headlong sway,
The faithless saddle-girths gave way.'T was while he toiled him to be freed,
And with the rein to raise the steed,
That from amazement's iron trance
All Wycliffe's soldiers waked at once.
Sword, halberd, musket-but, their blows
Hailed upon Bertram as he rose;
A score of pikes, with each a wound,
Bore down and pinned him to the ground;
But still his struggling force he rears,'Gainst hacking brands and stabbing spears;
Thrice from assailants shook him free,
Once gained his feet, and twice his knee.
By ten-fold odds oppressed, at length,
Despite his struggles and his strength,
He took a hundred mortal wounds,
As mute as fox'mongst mangling hounds;
And when he died, his parting groan
Had more of laughter than of moan!
They gazed, as when a lion dies,
And hunters scarcely trust their eyes,
But bend their weapons on the slain,
Lest the grim king should rouse again!
Then blow and insult some renewed,
And from the trunk the head had hewed,
But Basil's voice the deed forbade;
A mantle o'er the corse he laid: -
"Fell as he was in act and mind,
He left no bolder heart behind:
Then give him, for a soldier meet,
A soldier's cloak for winding-sheet."

That I shall mount my noble steed and lead my band no more;
They come, and, to my beard, they dare to tell me now that I,
Their own liege lord and master born, that I - ha! ha!- must die.

And rung the heavy oaken floor with many a martial tread;
WVhile from the rich, dark tracery, along the vaulted wall,

Fast hurrylng through the outer gate, the mailed retainers poured,
On through the portal's frowning arch, and thronged around the board  
While at its head, within his dark, carved, oaken chair of state,
Armed cap-a-pie, stern Rudiger, with girded falchion, sate.
"Fill every beaker up, my men! - pour forth the cheering wine!

" Ho! cravens! do ye fear him? Slaves! traitors! have ye flown t
o! cowards, have ye left me to meet him here alone?
"But I defy him!- let him come!"  Down rang the massy cup,
While from its sheath the ready blade came flashing half-way up;
And, with the black and heavy plumes scarce trembling on his head,
There, in his dark, carved, oaken chair, old Rudiger sat - dead!
18. "HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX," 16 e
- Robert Browning.
I SPRANG tO the stirrup, and Joris, and he;
I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three;
"Good speed!" cried the watch, as the gate-bolts undrew;
"Speed!" echoed the wall to us galloping through;
Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,
And into the midnight we galloped abreast.
Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace
Neck by neck, stride for stride, never changing our place.
I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,
Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right,
Rebuckled the cheek-strap, chained slacker the bit,Nor galloped less steadily Roland, a whit.'T was moonset at starting; but while we drew near
Lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear;
At Boom, a great yellow star came out to see;
At Diiffeld,'t was morning as plain as could be;
And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the half-chimq
So Joris broke silence with, " Yet there is tiie!"
At Aerschot, up leaped of a sudden the sun,
And against him the cattle stood black every one.
To stare through the mist at us galloping past,
And I saw my stout galloper Roland, at last,
With resolute shoulders, each butting away
The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray.
And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back
For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track'
And one eye's black intelligence, -ever that glance
O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance
421THE STANDARD SPEAKKR.
And the thick heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon
His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.
By Hasselt, Direk groaned; and cried Joris, " Stay spur!
Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her,
We'11 remember at Aix " - for one heard the quick wheeze
Of her chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering knees,
And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,
As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.
So we were left galloping, Joris and I,
Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;
The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh,'Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff;
Till over by Dalhem a dome-spire sprang white,
And 1" Gallop," gasped Joris, "for Aix is in sight! "
" How they'11 greet us!'- and all in a moment his roan
Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone;
And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight
Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate,
With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,
And with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim.
Then I cast loose my buffcoat, each holster let fall,
Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,
Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear,
Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse without peer;
Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good,
Till at length into Aix R6land galloped and stood.
And all I remember is, friends flocking round
As I sate with his head'twixt my knees on the ground,
And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,
As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,
Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)
Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent
19 TIHE SOLDIER FROM BINGEN. -Mrs. Norton.
A SOLDIE' of the Legion lay dying in Algiers,
There was lack of woman's nursing, there was dearth of woman's tears
But a comrade stood beside him, while the life-blood ebbed away,
And bent with pitying glance to hear each word he had to say.
The dying soldier faltered, as he took that comrade's hand,
And he said: " I never more shall see my own - my native land  
Take a message and a token to the distant friends of mine,
For I was bof- at BINGEN  at Bingen on' the Rhine!

To hear my mournful story, in the pleasant vineyard ground,

And midst the dead and dying were some grown old in wars,
The death-wound on their gallant breasts, - the last of. many sca s!
But some were young, and suddenly beheld Life's morn decline,
And one had come from Bingen - fair Bingen on the iRhine!
"Tell my mother that her other sons shall comfort her old age,
For I was still a truant bird, that thought his home a cage;
For my father was a soldier, and, even when a child,

And when he died, and left us to divide his scanty hoard,

My body will be out of pain, my soul be out of prison), -

"I saw the blue Rhine sweep along,- I heard, or seemed to hear,
The German songs we used tb' sing, in chorus sweet and clear;
And down the pleasant river, and up the slanting hill,

423THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
His trembling voice grew faint and hoarse, his gasp was childish weak
His eyes put on a dying look, - he sighed, and ceased to speak;
His comrade bent to lift him, but the spark of life had fled
The soldier of the Legion in a foreign land was dead!
And the soft moon rose up slowly, and calmly she looked down
On the red sand of the battle-field, with bloody corses strewn!
Yes, calmly on that dreadful scene her pale light seemed to shine,
A.s it shone on distant Bingen - fair Bingen on the Rhinae.
20. THE TORCH OF LIBERTY. -Thomas Moore.
I SAW it all in Fancy's glass -
Herself the fair, the wild magician,
Who bade this splendid day-dream pass,
And nanled each gliding apparition.'T was like a torch-race - such as they
Of Greece performed, in ages gone,
When the fleet youths, in long array,
Passed the bright torch triumphant on.
I saw the expectant Nations stand,
To catch the coming flame in turn;
I saw, from ready hand to hand,
The clear, though struggling, glory burn.
And, O, their joy, as it came near,'T was, in itself, a joy to see;--
While Fancy whispered in my ear,
" That torch they pass is Liberty!"
And each, as she received the flame,
Lighted her altar with its ray;
Then, smiling, to the next who came,
Speeded it on its sparkling way.
From Albion first, whose ancient shrine
WVas furnished with the fire already,
Columbia caught the boon divine,
And lit a flame, like Albion's, steadty.
The splendid gift then Gallia took,
And, like a wild Bacchante, raising
The brand aloft, its sparkles shook,
As she would set the world a-blazing!
Thus, kindling wild, so fierce and high
Her altar blazed into the air,
That Albion, to that fire too nigh,
Shrank back, and shuddered at its glare  
Next, Spain, - so new was light to her,
Leaped at the torch; but, ere the spark
424SARRATIVE AND LfRICAL. - DIM0iYD.
That fell upon, her shrine could stir,'T was quenched, and all again was dark!
Yet, no-- not quenched, - a treasure, worth
So much to mortals, rarely dies:
Again her living light looked forth,
And shone, a beacon, in all eyes  
Who next received the flame?  Alas!
Unworthy Naples. - Shame of shames,
That ever through such hands should pass'That brightest of all earthly flames!
Scarce had her fingers touched the torch,
When, frighted by the sparks it shed,
Nor waiting even to feel the scorch,
She dropped it to the earth - and fled!
And fallen it might have long remained;
But Greece, who saw her moment now,
Caught up the prize, though prostrate, stained,
And waved it round her beauteous brow.
And Fancy bade me mark where, o'er
Her altar, as its flame ascended,
Fair laurelled spirits seemed to soar,
Who thus in song their voices blended:
"Shine, shine forever, glorious Flame,
Divinest gift of gods to men!
From Greece thy earliest splendor came,
To Greece thy ray returns again.
Take, Freedom, take thy radiant round;
When dimmed, revive, - when lost, return,
Till not a shrine through earth be found,
On which thy glories shall not burn!'
21. THE SAILOR-BOY'S DREAM.--Dimond.
IN slumbers of midnight the sailor-boy lay,
His hammock swung loose at the sport of.the wind;
But, watch-worn and weary, his cares flew away,
And visions of happiness danced o'er his mind.
He dreamed of his home, of his dear native bowers,
And pleasurs that waited on life's merry morn;
While memory stood side-wise, half covered with flowers,
And restored every rose, but secreted its thorn.
The jessamine clambers in flower o'er the thatch,
And the swallow sings sweet from her nest in the walL'
All trembling with transport, he raises the latch,
And the voids of loved ones reply to his call.
425THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
A father bends o'er him with looks of delight,His cheek is impearled with a mother's warm tear;
And the lips of the boy in a love-kiss unite
With the lips of the maid whom his bosom holds dear.
The heart of the sleeper beats:high in his breast,
Joy quickens his pulse -all his hardships seem o'er;
And a murmur of happiness steals through his rest"0 O God! thou hast blest me, - I ask for no more."
Ah! whence is that flame which now bursts on his eye!
Ah! what is that sound that'now'larums his ear 2
IT is the lightning's red glare painting hell on the sky!'T is the crashing of thunder, the groan of the sphere  
He springs from his hammock- he flies to the deck;
Amazement confronts him with images dire;Wild winds and mad waves drive the vessel a wreck,
The masts fly in splinters - the shrouds are on fire!
Like mountains the billows tumultuously swell;
In vain the lost wretch calls on mercy to save;Unseen hands of spirits are ringing his knell,
And the death-angel flaps his dark wings o'er the wave.
0, sailor-boy! woe to thy dream of delight!
In darkness dissolves the gay frost-work of bliss;Where now is the picture that Fancy touched bright,
Thy parent's fond pressure, and love's honeyed kiss?
0, sailor-boy! sailor-boy! never again
Shall love, home or kindred, thy wishes repay;
Unblessed and unhonored, down deep in the main
Full many a score fathom, thy frame shall decay.
No tomb shall e'er plead to remembrance for thee,
Or redeem form or frame from the merciless surge;
But the white foaim of waves shall thy winding-sheet be
And winds in the midnight of winter thy dirge.
On beds of green sea-flower thy limbs shall be laid,
Around thy white bones the red coral shall grow;
Of thy fair yellow locks threads of amber be made,
And every part suit to thy mansion below.
Days, months, years, and ages, shall circle away,
And still the vast waters above thee shall roll;
Earth loses thy pattern for ever and aye -
0, sailor-boy' sailor-boy' peace to thy soul!

22 DAMON AND PYTHIAS. --.daptation of a translation from Sohziler, bi Sir A.
Bulwer Lytton.
"Now, Dionysius, - tyrant, - die!"
Stern Damon with his poniard crept:
The watchful guards upon him swept;
The grim king marked his bearing high.
"What wouldst thou with thy knife?  Reply!"--
"The city from the tyrant free ""The death-cross shall thy guerdon be.'
"I am prepared for death, nor pray,"
Haughtily Damon said, " to live;
Enough, if thou one grace wilt give:
For three brief suns the death delay!
A sister's nuptial rites now stay
My promised coming, leagues away;
I boast a friend, whose life for mine,
If I should fail the cross, is thine."
The tyrant mused, and smiled, and said,
With gloomy craft, " So let it be;
Three days I will vouchsafe to thee.
But, mark: if, when the time be sped,
Thou fail'st, thy surety dies instead.
His life shall buy thine own release;
Thy guilt atoned, my wrath shall cease."
And Damon sought his friend: "The king
Ordains, my life, the cross upon,
Shall pay the deed I would have done;
Yet grants three days' delay to me,
My sister's marriage-rites to see,
If thou, my Pythias, wilt remain
Hostage till I return again!  
One clasp of hands- and Pythias said
No word, but to the tyrant strode,
While Damon went upon his road.
Ere the third sun in Heaven was red,
The rite was o'er, the sister wed;
And back, with anxious heart unquailing,
He hastes to keep the pledge unfailing.
Down the great rains unending bore!
Down from -the hills the torrents rushed!
In one broad stream, the brooklets gushed

scientific mechanical improvement and its application to human Wants,
in the last twenty years, - to go no further back, - and think what a
world it has made;- how many comforts it has given to.man, how
many facilities; what it has done for his food and raiment, for his
communication with his fellow-man in every clime, for his instruction
in books, his amusements, his safety! - what new lands it has opened,
what old ones made accessible! - how it has enlarged the sphere of
his knowledge and conversancy with his species! It is all a great,
astounding marvel, a miracle which it oppresses the mind to think of
It is the smallest boast which can be made for it to say that, in all
desirable facilities in life, in the comfort that depends upon mechanism,
and inl all that is calculated to delight the senses or instruct the mind,
the man of this day, who has secured himself a moderate conmpetence,
is placed far in advance of the most wealthy, powerful and princely
of ancient times, - might I not say, of the times less than a century
gone by?
And yet we have only begun;--we are but on the threshold of
this epoch. A great celebration is now drawing to a close,- the celebration, by all nations, of the new era.  A vast multitude of all
peoples, nations and tongues, has been, but yesterday, gathered under
a magnificent crystal palace, in the greatest city of the world, to
illustrate and distinguish the achievements of art, - no less, also, to
dignify and exalt the great mechanical firaternity who have filled that
nalace with wonders. Is not this fact, of itself, charged with a
volume of comnlnent? What is it but the setting of the great distinctive seal upon the nineteetnth century? - an advertisment of the. fact
that society has risen to occupy a higher platform than ever before?
--a proclamation from the high places, announcing honor, honGr
immortal, to the workmen who fill this world with beauty, comfort and
power; honor to be forever embalmed in history, to be perpetuated in
monuments, to be written in the hearts of this and succeeding genera tions!

Frantic, dismayed, he takes his stand -
Dismayed, he strays and shouts around;
EIls voice awakes no answering sound.
No boat will leave the sheltering strand,
To bear him to the wished-for land;
No boatman will Death's pilot be;
The wild stream gathers to a sea!
Prostrate a while he raves - he weeps;
Then raised his arms to Jove, and cried
*" Stay thou, 0, stay the maddening tido!

And ere he sink adown the deeps,
If I should fail, his beams will see
My friend's last anguish - slain for me!"

And wave on wave succeeds, and dies;
And hour on hour, remorseless, flies;
Despair at last to daring grows:
Amid the flood his form he throws,
With vigorous arm the roaring waves

HEAVY and solemn,
A cloudy column,
Through the green plain they marching came!
Measureless spread, like a table dread,
For the wild grim dice of the iron game.

Hearts beat loud with a knelling sound;
Swift by the breasts that must bear the brunt,
Gallops the major along the -front;--

And the warriors, silent, halt!

See the smoke how the lightning is cleaving asunder!
Hark! the guns, peal on peal, how they boom in their thunder.
From host to host, with kindling sound,
The shouting signal circles round;
Ay, shout it forth to life or death,Freer already breathes the breath!
The war is waging, slaughter raging,
And heavy through the reeking pall
The iron death-dice fall-!
Nearer they close, - foes upon foes.
Ready! "- from square to square it goes.
They kneel as one man; from flank to flank,
And the fire comes sharp from the foremost rank.
Many a soldier to earth is sent,
Many a gap by the balls is rent;
O'er the corse before springs the hinder man,
That the line may not fail to the fearless van.
To the right, to the left, and around and around,
Death whirls in its dance on the bloody ground.
God's sunlight is quenched in the fiery fight,
Over the host falls a brooding night!
Brothers, God grant, when this life is o'er,
In the life to come that we meet once more.!
The dead men lie bathed in the weltering blood,
And the living are blent in the, slippery flood,
And the feet, as they reeling and sliding go,
Stumble still on the corses that sleep below.

BEFORE his lion-garden gate,
The wild-beast combat to await,
King Francis sate:
Around him were his nobles placed,
The balcony above was graced
By ladies of the court, in gorgeous state:
And as with his finger a sign he made,
The iron grating was open laid,
And with stately step and mien
A lion to enter was seen.
With fearful look
His mane he shook,
And yawning wide,
Stared around him on every side;
And stretched his giant limbs of strength,
And laid himself down at his fearful length
And the king a second signal made,And instant was opened wide
A second gate, on the other side,
From which, with fiery bound,
A tiger sprung.
Wildly the wild one yelled,
When the lion he beheld;
And, bristling at the look,
With his tail his sides he strook,
And rolled his rabid tongue.
And, with glittering eye,
Crept round the lion slow and shy
Then, horribly howling,
And grimly growling,
Down by his side himself he laid.
And the king another signal made:
The opened grating vomited then
Two leopards forth from their drealful den,,
They rush on the tiger, with signs of rage,
Eager the deadly fight to wage,
Who, fierce. with paws uplifted stood,
131TIIE STANDARD SPERAKEIt.
And the lion sprang up with an awful roar,
Then were still the fearful four:
And the monsters on the ground
Crouched in a circle round,
Greedy to taste of blood.
Now, from the balcony above,
A snowy hand let fall a glove:
Midway between the beasts of prey,
Lion and tiger, - there it lay,
The winsome lady's glove!
And the Lady Kunigund, in bantering mood,
Spoke to Knight Delorges, who by her stood:" If the flame which but now to me you swore
Burns as strong as it did before,
Go pick up my glove, Sir Knight."
And he, with action quick as sight,
In the horrible place did stand;
And with dauntless mien,
From the beasts between
Took up the glove, with fearless hand;
And as ladies and nobles the bold deed saw,
Their breath they held, through fear and awe.
The glove he brings back, composed and light.
IIis praise was announced by voice and look,
And Kunigund rose to receive the knight
WVith a smile that promised the deed to requite;
But straight in her face he flung the glove," I neither desire your thanks nor love;"
And from that same hour the lady forsook.

"s WHY iS the Forum crowded? What means this stir in Rome?"
" Claimed as a slave, a free-born maid is dragged here from her home
On fair Virginia, Claudius has cast his eye of blight;
The tyrant's creature, Marcus, asserts an owner's right.
0, shame on Roman manhood! Was ever plot more clear?
But, look! the maiden's father comes! Behold Virginius here! "
Straightway Virginius led the maid a little space aside,
To where the reeking shambles stood, piled up with horn and hide
Hard by a butcher on a block had laid his whittle down, -
Virginius caught the whittle up, and hid it in his gown.

And then his eyes grew very dim, and his throat began to swell,
And in a hoarse, changed voice, he spake, "Farewell, sweet child
Farewell!
The house that was the happiest within the Roman walls, -
The house that envied not the wealth of Capua's marble halls, -
Now, for the brightness of thy smile, must have eternal gloom,
Arnd, for the music of thy voice, the silence of the tomk
The time is come. The tyrant points his eager hand this way!
See how his eyes gloat on thy grief, like a kite's upon the prey!
WTith all his wit, he little deems, that, spurned, betrayed, bereft,
Thy father hath, in his despair, one fearful refuge left;
He little deems, that, in this hand, I clutch what still can save
Thy gentle youth from taunts and blows, the portion of the slave
Yea, and from nameless evil, that passeth taunt and blow,Foul outrage, which thou knowest not,- which thou shalt never
know.
Then clasp me round the neck once more, and give me one mole kiss;
And now, mine own dear little girl, there is no way but this! "
With that, he lifted high the steel, and smote her in the side,
And in her blood she sank to earth, and with one sob she died.
Then, for a little moment, all people held their breath;
And through the crowded Forum was stillness as of death;
And in another moment brake forth from one and all
A cry as if the Volscians were coming o'er the wall;
Till, with white lips and bloodshot eyes, Virginius tottered nigh,
And stood before the judgment seat, and held the knife on high.
O0, dwellers in the nether gloom, avengers of the slain,
By this dear blood I cry to you, do right between us twain;
And e'en as Appius Claudius hath dealt by me and mine,
Deal you by Appius Claudius and all the Claudian line! "
So spake the slayer of his child; then, where the body lay,
Pausing, he cast one haggard glance, and turned and went his way.
Then up sprang Appius Claudius: " Stop him, alive or dead'
Ten thousand pounds of copper to the man who brings his head! "
He looked upon his clients, - but none wotld work his will;
Hie looked upon his lietors, - but they trembled and stood still.
And as Virginius through the press his way in silence cleft,
Ever the mighty multitude fell back to right and left..And he hath passed in safety unto his woful home,
An i there ta'en horse to tell the camp what deeds are done in Rome.

Then out spoke brave iloratius, the Captain of the gate:
~To every man upon this earth death cometh, soon or late.
iHew down the bridge, Sir Consul, with all the speed ye may;
1, with two more to help me, will hold the foe in play.
In yon strait path a thousand may well be stopped by three.
Now who will stand on either hand, and keep the bridge with Inc?'
Then out spake Spurius Lartius, - a Ramnian proud was he, -
" Lo, I will stand at thy right hand, and keep the bridge with thee.
And out spake strong Herminius, - of Titian blood was he," I will abide on thy left side, and keep the bridge with thee."
" Horatius," quoth the Consul, " as thou sayest, so let it be."
And straight against that great array, forth went the dauntless Three
Soon all Etruria's noblest felt their hearts sink to see
On the earth the bloody corpses, in the path the dauntless Three.
And from the ghastly entrance, where those bold Romans stood,
The bravest shrank like boys who rouse an old bear in the wood.
But meanwhile axe and lever have manfully been plied,
And now the bridge hangs tottering above the boiling tide.
"Come back, come back, Horatius!" loud cried the Fathers all:
"Back, Lartius! back, IHerminius! back, ere the ruin fall!"
Back darted Spurius Lartius; Herminius darted back;
And, as they passed, beneath their feet they felt the timbers crack
But when they turned their faces, and on the further shore
Saw brave Horatius stand alone, they would have crossed once more.
But, with a crash like thunder, fell every loosened beami,
And, like a dam, the mighty wreck lay right athwart the stream  
And a long shout of triumph rose from the walls of Rome.
As to the highest turret-tops was splashed the yellow foam.
And, like a horse unbroken when first he feels the rein,
The furious river struggled hard, and tossed his tawny mane,
And burst the curb, and bounded, rejoicing to be free,
And battlement, and plank, and pier, whirled headlong to the sea.
Alone stood brave Horatius, but constant still in mind;
Thrice thirty thousand foes before, and the broad flood behind..
"Down with him!" cried false Sextus, with a smile on his pale faea
"Now yield thee," cried Lars Pors6na, " now yield thee to our grace
Round turned he, as not deigning those craven ranks to see;
Naught spake he to Lars Pors6na, to Sextus naught spake he;
But he saw on Palatinus the white porch of his home,
And he spake to the noble river that rolls by the towers of Rome
434NARRATIVE AND LYRICAL. - AYTOUN.
O, Tiber! fat-her Tiber! to whom the Romans pray,
A Roman's life, a Roman's arms, take thou in charge this day!
So he spake, and, speaking, sheathed the good sword by his side,
And, with his harness on his back, plunged headlong in the tide.
No sound of joy or sorrow was heard from either bank;
But friends and foes, in dumb surprise, stood gazing where he sank;
And when above the surges they saw his crest appear,
Rome shouted, and e'en Tuscany could scarce forbear to cheer.
But fiercely ran the current, swollen high by months of rain:
And fast his blood was flowing; and he was sore in pain,
And heavy with his armor, and spent with changing blows:
And oft they thought him sinking, - but still again he rose.
Never, I ween, did swimmer, in such an evil case,
Struggle through such a raging flood safe to the landing-place:
But his limbs were borne up bravely by the brave heart within,
And our good father Tiber bare bravely up his chin.
C' urse on him!" quoth false Sextus; "will not the villain drown?
But for this stay, ere close of day we should have sacked the town! "'Heaven help him! " quoth Lars PorsOna, "and bring him safe to
shore;
For such a gallant feat of arms was never seen before."
And now he feels the bottom; - now on dry earth he stands;
Now round him throng the Fathers to press his gory hands.
And now, with shouts and clapping, and noise of weeping loud,
He enters through the River Gate, borne by the joyous crowd.
27. THE EXECUTION OF BIONTROSE, 1645. - Aytoun.
There is no ingredient of fiction in the historical incidents recorded in the following ballad.
Fhe perfect serenity of Montrose, the "Great Marquis," as he was called, in the hour of trial
tnd death, - the courage and magnanimity which he displayed to the last, - have been dwelt
npon, with admiration, by writers of every class. The following has been slightly abridged from
the original.
COME hither, Evan Cameron; come, stand beside my knee,[ hear the river roaring down towards the wintry sea.
There's shouting on the mountain-side, there's war within the blast;
Old faces look upon me, - old forms go trooping past.
I hear the pibroch wailing amidst the din of fight,
And my dim spirit wakes again, upon the verge of night.
1' was I that led the Highland host through wild Lochaber's snows,
What time the plaided clans came down to battle with IMontrose.
I've told thee how the Southrons fell beneath the broad claymore,
And how we smote the Campbell clan by Inverlochy's shore.
I've told thee how we swept Dundee, and tamed the Lindsays' prida
IBut never have I told thee yet how the Great Marquis died.

renown;
Remember of what blood thou art, and strike the caitiff down.
They brought him to the Watergate, hard bound with hempen span:
As though they held a lion there, and not a'fenceless man.
But when he came, though pale and wan, he looked so great and high,
So noble was his manly front, so calm his steadfast eye,
The rabble rout forbore to shout, and each man held his breath;
For well they knew the hero's soul was face to face with death.
Had I been there, with sword in hand, and fifty Camerons by,
That day, through high Dunedin's streets, had pealed the slogan-cry.
Not all their troops of trampling horse, nor might of mailed men,
Not all the rebels in the South, had borne us backwards then!
Once more his foot on Highland heath had trod as free as air,
Or I, and all who bore my name, been laid around him there!
It might not be. They placed him next within the solemn hall,
W There once the Scottish kings were throned amidst their nobles all.
But there was dust of vulgar feet on that polluted floor,
And perjured traitors filled the place where good men sate before.
With savage glee came Warriston, to read the murderous doom;
And then uprose the great Montrose in the middle of the room.
" Now, by my faith as belted knight, and by the name I bear,
And by the bright Saint Andrew's cross that waves above us there,--.
Yea, by a greater, mightier oath, - and 0, that such should be! -
By that dark stream of royal blood that lies'twixt you and me, -
I have not sought in battle-field a wreath of such renown,
Nor hoped I on my dying day to win the martyr's crown!
"' There is a chamber far away where sleep the good and brave,
But a better place ye've named for me than by my fathers' grave.
For truth and right,'gainst treason's might, this hand hath always
striven,
And ye raise it up for a witness still in the eye of earth and Heaven
Then nail my head on yonder tower, - give every town a limb, -
And God who made shall gather them: I go from you to Him!"
The morning dawned full darkly; like a bridegroom from his room,
Came the hero from his prison to the scaffold and the doom.
There was glory on his forehead, there was lustre in his eye
And he never walked to battle more proudly than to die;
There was color in his visage, though the cheeks of all were wan,
And they marvelled as they saw him pass, that great and goodly maw
436'NARRATIVE AND LYRICAL. - SHELLEY.
Then radiant and serene he stood, and cast his cloak away
For he had ta'en his latest look of earth and sun and day.
He mounted up the scaffold, and he turned him to the crowd,
But they dared not trust the people, - so he might not speak aloud,
But he looked upon the Heavens, and they were clear and blue,
And in the liquid ether the eye of God shone through:
A beam of light fell o'er him, like a glory round the shriven,
And he climbed the lofty ladder as it were the path to Heaven.
Then came a flash from out the cloud, and a stunning thunder-roll;
And no man dared to look aloft; fear was on every soul.
There was another heavy sound,- a hush, and then a groan;
And darkness swept across the sky,- the work of death was done!
28. PEACE AND WAR. -Percy Bysshe Shelley. Born, 1792; died, 1822.
How beautiful this night! the balimiest sigh
Which vernal zephyrs breathe in evening's ear
Were discord to the speaking quietude
That wraps this moveless scene. Heaven's ebon vault,
Studded with stars unutterably bright,
Through which the moon's unclouded grandeur rolls,
Seems like a canopy which love has spread
Above the sleeping world. Yon gentle hills,
Robed in a garment of untrodden snow;
Yon darksome rocks, whence icicles depend,
So stainless that their white and glittering spires
Tinge not the moon's pure beam; yon castled steep,
Whose banner hangeth o'er the time-worn tower
So idly that rapt fancy deemeth it
A metaphor of peace; - all form a scene
Where musing solitude might love to lift
Her soul above this sphere of earthliness;
Where silence undisturbed might watch alone,
So cold, so bright, so still:
Ah! whence yon glare
That fires the arch of Heaven? - that dark red smoke
Blotting the silver moon? The stars are quenched
In darkness, and the pure and spangling snow
Gleams faintly through the gloom that gathers round p
Hark to that roar, whose swift and deafening peals
In countless echoes through the mountains ring,
Startling pale midnight on her starry throne!
Now swells the intermingling din; the jar,
Frequent and frightful, of the bursting bomb;
The falling beam, the shriek, the groan, the shout.
The ceaseless elangor, and the rush of men

The applauding smile of Heaven.? The high-born ~oui

Beneath its native quarry.  Tired of earth

Refulgent from the stroke of Csesar's fate,

Did ye not hear it - No;'t was but the wind,
Or the car rattling o'er the stony street.
On with the dance! let joy be unconfined,
No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet
To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet!
But hark! that heavy sound breaks in once more,
As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
And nearer, clearer, deadlier, than before!
Arm! arm! it is - it is - the cannon's opening roar!
Within a windowed niche of that high hall
Sat Brunswick's fated chieftain. He did hear
That sound the first amidst the festival,
And caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;
And when they smiled because he deemed it near,
His heart more truly knew that peal too well,
Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,
And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell.
He rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.
Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,
And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,
And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago
Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness;
And there were sudden partings, such as press
The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
Which ne'er might be repeated. Who could guess
If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,
Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise
And there was mounting in hot haste: the steed,
The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,
Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,
And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;
And the deep thunder, peal on peal, afar;
And near, the beat of the alarming drum
Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;
While thronged the citizens, with terror dumb,
Or whispering, with white lips-" The foe' Thev come  They
come! "
Last noon beheld them fiall of lusty life;
Last eve, in Beauty's circle, proudly gay;
The midnight brought the signal-sound of strife
The morn, the marshalling in arms; the day,

And his drooped head sinks gradually low,
And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow
From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,
Like the first of a thunder-shower; and now
The arena swims around him - he is gone,
Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hailed the wretch who won.
He heard it, but he heeded not: his eyes
Were with his heart, and that was far away;
He reeked not of the life he lost nor prize,
But where his rude hut by the Danube lay,
There were his young barbarians all at play,

To teach me what thou art:

A midway station given,
For happy spirits to alight,
Betwixt the earth and Heaven.

Thy fodrm to please me so,
As when I dreamt of gems and gold
Hid in thy radiant bow?
When Science from Creation's face
Enchantment's veil withdraws,,What lovely visions yield their place
To cold material laws!
And yet, fair bow, no fabling dreams,
But words of the Most High,'Have told why first thy robe of beams
Was woven in the sky.
When, o'er the green, undeluged earth,
Heaven's covenant thou didst shine,
How came the world's gray fathers forth
To watch thy sacred sign!
And when its yellow lustre smifed
O'er mountains yet untrod,
Each mother held aloft her child
To bless the bow of God.
Alethinks, thy jubilee to keep,
The first-made anthem rang
On earth delivered from the deep,
And the first poet sang.

Unraptured greet thy beam;

Why speak ye no word? " said Glenara the stern.
"And tell me, I charge you, ye clan of my spouse,
Why fold ye your mantles, why cloud ye your brows?"

But each mantle, unfolding, a dagger displayed.

8. TIlE DUELLIST'S HONOR. -Bishop England. Born, 1786; died, 1842.
HONOR is the acquisition and preservation of the dignity of our
nature: that dignity consists in its perfection; that perfection is
found in observing the laws of our Creator; the laws of the Creator
are the dictates of reason and of religion: that is, the observance of
what He teaches us by the natural light of our own minds, and by
the special revelations of His will manifestly given.  They both concur in teaching us that individuals have not the dominion of the;town lives; otherwise, no suicide would be a criminal. They concur
teaching us that we ought to be amenable to the laws of the societ;,
of which we are members; otherwise, morality and honor would be
consistent with the violation of law anid the disturbance of the social
system.  They teach us that society cannot'continue to exist where
the public tribunals are despised or undervalued, and the redress of
injuries withdrawn from the calm regulation of public justice, for the
purpose of being committed to the caprice of private passion, and the
execution of individual ill-will; therefore, the man of honor abides
by the law of God, reveres the statutes of his country, and is respectful and amenable to its authorities.  Such, my friends, is what the
reflecting portion of mankind has always thought upon the subject of
honor. This was the honor of the Greek; this was the honor of the
Roman; this the honor of the Jew; this the honor of the Gentile;
this, too, was the honor of the Christian, until the superstition and
barbarity of Northern devastators darkened his glory and degraded
his character.
Man, then, has not power over his own life; much less is he jutified in depriving another human being of life.  Upon what grcund
can he who engages in a duel, through the fear of ignoniny, lay
claim to courage?  Unfortunate delinquent! Do you not see by how
many lirks your victim was bound to a multitude of others?   Does
his vain aiid idle resignation of his title to life absolve you from the
enormous claims which society has upon you for his services, --his
family for that support, of which you have robbed them, without your
own enrichlnent?   Go, stand over that body; call back thal shm

And now on the Saxons his clansmen advance,
With a shout from each heart, and a soul in each lance;
He rushed, like a storm, o'er the night-covered heath,
And swept through their ranks like the angel of death.
Then hurrah! for thy glory, young chieftain, hurrah!
O! had we such lightning-souled heroes to-day,
Again would our "sunburst" expand in the gale
And Freedom exult o'er the green Innisfail!
40. ODE ON THE PASSIONS.- William Collins.
WHEN Music, Heavenly maid, was young,
While yet in early Greece she sung,
The Passions oft, to hear her shell,
Thronged around her magic cell;
Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting
Possessed beyond the Muse's painting,
By turns, they felt the glowing mind
Disturbed, delighted, raised, refined:
Till once,'t is said, when all were fired,
Filled with fury, rapt, inspired,
From the supporting myrtles round
They snatched her instruments of sound;
And, as they oft had heard apart
Sweet lessons of her forceful art,
Each - for Madness ruled the hour
Would prove his ovn expressive power.
First, Fear his hand, its skill to try,
Amid the chords bewildered laid;
And back recoiled, he knew not why,
Even at the sound himself had made.
Next, Anger rushed, his eyes on fire,
In lightnings owned his secret stings:
In one rude clash he struck the lyre,
And swept, with hurried hands, the strings.
With woful measures, wan Despair--
Low sullen sounds! - his grief beguiled;
A solemn, strange, and mingled air;'T was sad, by fits, - by starts,'t was wild.
But thou, 0 Hope! with eyes so fair,
What was thy delighted measure?
Still it whispered prqmised pleasure,
And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail!
Still would her touch the strain prolong;
And, from the rocks, the woods, the vale,NARRATTVE AND LYRICAL. - - CULLINS.
She called on Echo still through all her song;
And, where her sweetest theme she chose,
A soft responsive voice was heard at every close;
And Iope, enchanted, smiled, and waved her golden hair.
And longer had she sung - but, with a frown,
Revenge impatient rose.
He threw his blood-stained sword in thunder down;
And, with a withering look,
The war-denouncing trumpet took,
And blew a blast, so loud and dread,
Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe;
And, ever and anon, he beat
The doubling drum with furious heat.
And though, sometimes, each dreary pause between,
Dejected Pity, at his side,
IIer soul-subduing voice applied,
Yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien;
While each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his heet.
Thy numbers, Jealousy, to naught were fixed;
Sad proof of thy distressful state!
Of differing themes the veering song was mixed:
And now it courted Love - now, raving, called on Hate,
With eyes upraised, as one inspired,
Pale MIelancholy sat retired;
And, from her wild sequestered seat,
In notes, by distance made more sweet,
Poured through the mellow horn her pensive soul:
And, dashing soft, from rocks around,
Bubbling runnels joined the sound;
Through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole:
Or o'er some haunted streams, with fond delay -
Round a holy calm diffusing,
Love of peace and lonely musing -
In hollow murmu-rs died away.
Buht, 0' how altered was its sprightly tone,
When Cheerfulness, a nymph of healthiest hue,
Her bow across her shoulder flung,
Her buskins gemmed with morning dew
Blew an inspiring air, that dale and taicket rung,
The hunter's call, to Faun and Dryad known!
The oak-crowned sisters, and their chaste-eyed..-*
Satyrs, and sylvan boys, were seen,
Peeping from forth their allevs green'Brown Exercise rejioiced to hear;

He, with viny crown, advancing,
First to the lively pipe his hand addressed;
But soon he saw the brisk awakening viol,
Whose sweet entrancing voice he loved the best,
They- -ould have thought, who heard the strain
They saw, in Tempe's vale, her native maids
Amid the festal sounding shades,
To some unwearied minstrel dancing;
While, as his flying fingers kissed the strings,
Love framed with Mirth a gay fantastic round--
Loose were her tresses seen, her zone unbound;
And he, amid his frolic play,
As if he would the charming air repay,
Shook thousand odors from his dewy wings.
41. THE GREEK AND TUIJRKMAN. - Rev. George Croly.
3iaptpUon of a night attack, by Constantine Palmologus, on a detached cam}) of Mohae
med II., during the siege of Constantinople.
THE Turkman lay beside the river;
The wind played loose through bow and quiver,
The charger on the bank fed free,
The shield hung glittering from the tree,
The trumpet, shawn, and atabal,
Lay screened from dew by cloak and pall,
For long and weary was the way
The hordes had marched that burning day.
Above them, on the sky of June,
Broad as a buckler glowed the moon,
Flooding with glory vale and hill.
In silver sprang the mountain rill;
The weeping shrub in silver bent;
A pile of silver stood the tent;
All soundless, sweet tranquillity;
All beauty,- hill, brook, tent, and tree.
There came a sound -'t was like the gush
When night-winds shake the rose's bush!
There came a sound-'t was like the tread
Of wolves along the valley's bed!
There came a sound-'t was like the flow
Of rivers swoln with melting snow!
There came a sound-'t was like the roar
Of Ocean on its winter shore!
" DEATH TO THE TURK!" up rose the yellOn rolled the charge - a thunder peal
450NARRATIVE AND LYRICAL. -- KNOX.
T'he Tartar arrows fell like rain, -
They clanked on helm, and mail, and chain:
In blood, in hate, in death, were twined
Savage and Greek, - mad, - bleeding, - blind,And still, on flank, and front, and rear,
Raged, Constantine, thy thirsting spear!
Brassy and pale,- a type of doom,--
Labored the moon through deepening gloom.
Down plunged her orb -'t was pitchy night'
Now, Turkman, turn thy reins for flight!
On rushed their thousands in the dark!
But in their camp a ruddy spark
Like an uncertain meteor reeled,Thy hand, brave king, that fire-brand wheeled!
Wild burst the burning element
O'er man and courser, flood and tent!
And through the blaze the Greeks outsprang,
Like tigers, - bloody, foot and fang! -
With dagger-stab, and falchion-sweep,
Delving the stunned and staggering heap,
Till lay the slave by chief and khan,
And all was gone that once was man!
There's wailing on the Euxine shore -
Her chivalry shall ride no more!
There's wailing on thy hills, Altai,
For chiefs the Grecian vulture's prey.  
But, Bosphorus, thy silver wave
Hears shouts for the returning brave;
For, kingliest of a kingly line,
Lo! there comes glorious Constantine!
42. THE CURSE OF CAIN.-- Knocx.
0, THE wrath of the Lord is a terrible thing! -
Like the tempest that withers the blossoms of spring,
Like the thunder that bursts on the summer's domain,
It fell on the head of the homicide Cain.
And, lo! like a deer in the fright of the chase,
With a fire in his heart, and a brand on his face,
He speeds him afar to the desert of Nod, -
A vagabond, smote by the vengeance of God!
All nature, to him, has been blasted and banned,
And the blood of a brother yet reeks on his hand;
And no vintage has grown, and no fountain has sprung,
For cheering his heart, or for cooling his tongue.
451THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
The groans of a father his slumber shall start,
And the tears of a mother shall pierce to his heart,
And the kiss of his children shall scorch him like flame,
When he thinks of the curse that hangs over his name.
And the wife of his bosom - the faithful and fair--
Can mix no sweet drop in his cup of despair;
For her tender caress, and her innocent breath,
But stir in his soul the hot embers of death.
And his offering may blaze unregarded by Heaven'
And his spirit may pray, yet remain unforgiven;
And his grave may be closed, yet no rest to him bring;--
0, the wrath of the Lord is a terrible thing!

THE Muse, disgusted at an age and clime
Barren of every glorious theme,
In distant lands now waits a better time,
Producing subjects worthy fame.
In happy climes, where from the genial sun,
And virgin earth, such scenes ensue,
The force of art by nature seems outdone,
And fancied beauties by the true:
In happy climes, the seat of innocence,
Where Nature guides, and Virtue rules, -
Where men shall not impose, for truth and sense
The pedantry of courts and schools:
There shall be sung another golden age,
The rise of empire and of arts,
The good and great inspiring epic rage,.
The wisest heads and noblest hearts.
Not such as Europe breeds in her decay, -
Such as she bred when fresh and young,
When heavenly flame did animate her clay, -
By future poets shall be sung.
Westward the course of empire takes its way
The four first acts already past,
A fifth shall close the drama with the day;
Time's noblest offspring is the last.

WEEP not for him! The Thracians wisely gave
Tears to the birth-couch, triumph to the grave.

WVeep not for him whose lustrous life has known
No field of fame he has not made his own!

Still bright-browed Victory drew the patriot's car.
Whether he met the dusk and prowling foe

Or where the Southern swamps, with steamy breatn,
Smite the worn warrior with no warrior's death
Or where, like surges on the rolling main,

How frail the fortress where the heart is weakl

Men sternly knit, and firm to do or die;Or where on thousands thousands crowding rush

4. THE PASSAGE. - Uhland. Translated by Miss Austen.
MANY a year is in its grave
Since I crossed this restless wave,
And the evening, fair as ever,
Shines on ruin, rock and river.
Then, in this same boat, beside,
Sat two comrades, old and tried;
One with all a father's truth,
One with all the fire of youth.
One on earth in science wrought,
And his grave in silence sought;
But the younger, brighter form,
Passed in battle and in storm.
So, whene'er I turn mine eye
Back upon the. days gone by,
Saddening thoughts of friends come o er me,
Friends who closed their course before me.
Yet what binds us, friend to friend,
But that soul with soul can blend?
Soul-like were those hours of yoreLet us walk in soul once more!
Take, O boatman, twice thy fee! --
Take, - I give it willinglyFor, invisibly to thee.
Spirits twain have crossed with me.

COURAGE! - Nothing can withstaind
Long a wronged, undaunted land,
If the hearts within her be
True unto themselves and thee
Thou freed giant, Liberty!

When the helm is on thy brow,
And the sword is in thy hand,

Armed with all their father's fame,
They will win and wear a name,
That shall go to endless glory,
Like the Gods of old Greek story,
Raised to Heaven and heavenly worth,
For the good they gave to earth.

None so humble, none so weak,
But may flush his father's cheek,
And his maiden's dear and true,
WVith the deeds that he may do.
Be his days as dark as night,
Hie may make himseil a light.

There are stars when day is done!

That hath strength to dig a grave,
And therein his fetters hide,
And lay a tyrant by his side?

For a time, can never die!

TIll MOOR'S REVENGE. - Origznal Paraphrase from the Polish of Mickiaev,e
BEroiE Grenada's fated walls, encamped in proud array,
And flushed with many a victory, the Spanish army lay.
Of all Grenada's fortresses but one defies their might:
On Alphuara's minarets the crescent still is bright.
Almanzor! King Almanzor! all vainly you resist:
Your little band is fading fast away like morning mist,
A direr foe than ever yet,'hey met on battle-plain
Assaults life's inmost citadel, and heaps the ground with slain
456NARRATIVE AND LYRICA t.
One onset more of Spanish ranks, - and soon it will be made,And Allhuara's towers must reel, and in the dust be laid.
"' And shall the haughty infidel pollute this sacred land? "'
Atmanzor said, as mournfully he marked his dwindling band.
" Upon our glorious crescent shall the Spaniard set his heel?
And is there not one lingering hope? Can Heaven no aid reveal?
Ay, by our holy Prophet, now, one ally still remains!
And I will bind him close to me, - for better death than chains!
The victors at the banquet sat, and music lent its cheer,
When suddenly a sentry's voice announced a stranger near
From Alphuara had he come, with fierce, unwonted speed,
And much it would import to SpaeI the inews he bore to heed.
" Admit him! " cry the revellers; and in the pilgrimn strode,
And, throwing off his mantle loose, a Moorish habit showed!
"Almanzor! King Almanzor!" they cried, with one acclaim:
"Almanzor! " said the Moslem cnief;' "Almanzor is my name.
"To serve your prophet and your king, 0 Spaniards, I am here:
Believe, reject me, if you will, - this breast has outlived fear!
No longer in his creed or cause Almanzor can confide;
For all the Powers above,'t is clear, are fighting on your side."
"Now, welcome, welcome, gallant Moor! " the Spanish chieftain said:
"Grenada's last intrenchment now we speedily shall tread.
Approach, embrace; our waning feast thy coming shall renew;
And in this cup of foaming wine we'11 drink to yours and you."
Right eagerly, to grasp the hands outstretched on every side,
Almanzor rushed, and greeted each as bridegroom might his bride:
He glued his fevered lips to theirs, - he kissed them on the cheek,
And breathed on all as if his heart would all its passion wreak.
But suddenly his limbs relax, a flush comes o'er his face,
He reels, as, with a pressure faint, he gives a last embrace;
And livid, purple grows his skin, and wild his eyeballs roll,
And some great torture seems to heave the life-roots of his soul.
" Look, Giaours! * miscreants in race, and infidels in creed!
Look on this pale, distorted face, and tell me what ye read!
These limbs convulsed, these fiery pangs, these eyeballs hot and blear
Ha I know ye not wha.t they portentd? The plague the plague, is
here!
And it has sealed you for its own; ay, every Judas kiss
I gave shall bring anon to you an agony like this!
All art is vain: your poisoned blood all leechcraft will defy,
Like. me ye shall in anguish writhe - like me in torture die' "
Once more he stepped their chief to reach, and blast him with his
breath;
But sank, as if Revenge itself were striving hard with Death.

VAST as our firmament may be, has it boundaries, or does it stretch
away into infinitude?  Are those awful spaces, that surround it on
every side, void, emnpty, - or are they tenanted by worlds and systems
similar to our own?  No wonder that a mind like Ilersehell's should
have rushed to the conclusion that the space around our system was a
vault, in whose capacious bosom myriads of mighty clusters like our
own universe are placed.  If it be true that this great scheme of ours
is simply that which I-lerschell first supposed it, but still a great, separate, distinlct scheme, whose nature is, perhaps, more than anything
else, represented by these singular Nebulse, what must we think with
regard to it? Surely it is, that notwithstanding its immense diffusion,
its vast confines, the great space through which its different portions
range, thlere must lie around it, on every side, vast untenanted spaces;
and, if this be so, may it not be that amid all that space, also, there
are floating great schemes of being like ours, - schemes, I say, of
different shape, of different character, but lying in these vast regions
of space like ours, -schemes quite as magnificent as that vast system
to which we ourselves belong? If this be so, what a conception, in

The chieftains armed as if they longed to hear the clash of steel.

1. BALAAMI'S PROPHECY IN BEHALF OF ISRAEL.--Numbers.
AND Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his
tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of G-od came upon him.
And he took up his parable, and said:
Balaam, the son of Beor, hath said, and the man whose eyes are
open, hath said; -h e hath said, which heard the words of God, which
saw the vision of the Almighty,- falling into a trance, but having
his eyes open:-How    goodly are thy tents, 0  Jacob, and thy
tabernacles, 0 Israel! As the valleys are they spread forth, as
gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the Lord,
hath planted, and as cedar-trees beside the waters.  His king shall
be highler than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
God is not a man, that He should lie; neither the son of man, that
He should repent. Hath He said, and shall He not do it?  Or, hath
He spoken, and shall HIe not make it good? Behold, I have received
commant.dment to bless; and He hath blessed; and I cannot reverse
it.  How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed?  Or, how shall
I defy, whom the Lord hath not defied? He hath not beheld iniquity
in Jacob, neither hath HIe seen perverseness in Israel: the Lord his
God is with him, and the shout of a King is among them.   God
brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were, the strength of
an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations, hib enemies, and shall break
their bones, and pierce them through with hib arrows.'Surely there
is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divinationsagainst
Israel: according to this time it shall- be said of Jacob and of Israel,
Whlat hath God wrought! Behold, the People shall rise up as a
great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down
until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.
For, from the top of the rocks I see him; and from the hills 1
behold him: lo, the People shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.  Who can count the dust of Jacob, and tho
number of the fourth part of Israel? DI.t me die the. death of. the

2 PAUL's DEFENCE BEFORE FESTUS AND AGRIPPA.
I THINK myself happy, King Agrippa, because I shall answer for
myself this day before thee, touching all the things whereof I anm
accused of the Jews; especially because I know thee to be expert ir,
all customs and questions which are among the Jews; wherefore I
beseech thee to hear me patiently.
My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among
mine own Nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; which knew me
from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest
sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee. And now I stand and am
judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers;
unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and
night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, King Agrippa, I am
accused of the Jews.
Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God
should raise the dead? I verily thought with myself, that I ought
to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth; which
thing I also did in Jerusalem; and many of the saints did I shut up
in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and whtn
they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme,
and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto
strange cities.
Whereupon, as I went to Damascus, with authority and commission
from the chief priests, at mid-day, 0 King! I saw in the way a light
from Heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about
me, and them which journeyed with me. And when we were all
fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me. and saying, in
the Ilebrew tongue, " Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is
hard for thee to kick against the goads." And I said, " Who art thou,
Lord? "  And he said, " I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest; but
rise, and stand upon thy feet; for I have appeared unto thee for this
purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness, both of these things
wlhich tl(ou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear
unto thee; delivering thee from the People, and from the Gentiles,
unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them
from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; that
they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them
wvhich are sanctified by faith that is in me."
Whereupon, 0 King Agrippa! I was not disobedient unto the
heavenly vision; but showed first unto them of Damascus and at
Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the
Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet
for repentance. For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple,
and went about to kill me. Having, therefore, obtained help of God,
I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying
none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say

OM. OINIPOTENCE OF JEHOVAH.- Job, translated by Rev. G. R. Noyes
HENr spake Jehovah to Job out of the whirlwind, and said:
WVho is this, that darkeneth my counsels by words without knowled  I
Gird up thy loins like a man!
I will ask thee, and answer thou me!
Where wast thou, when I laid the foundations of the earth?
Declare, since thou hast such knowledge!
Who fixed its dimensions? since thou knowest!
Or who stretched out the line upon it
Upon what were its foundations fixed
And who laid its corner-stone,
When the morning-stars sang together,
And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
Hast thou penetrated to the springs of the sea,
And walked through the recesses of the deep?
Have the gates of death been disclosed to thee,
And hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?
Hast thou surveyed the breadth of the earth?
Declare, since thou knowest it all!
Where is the way by which light is distributed
And the East wind let loose upon the earth?
Who hath prepared channels for the rain,
And a path for the glittering thunderbolt,
To give rain to the land without an inhabitant,
To the wilderness, where is no man;
To satisfy the desolate and waste ground,
And cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
Canst thou bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades,
Or loosen the bands of Orion?
Canst thou lead forth Mazzaroth in its season,
Or guide Arctirus with his sons?
Knowest thou the ordinances of the Heavens?
Itast thou appointed their dominion over the earth?
Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,
So that abundance of waters will cover thee?
(anst thou send forth lightnings, so that they will go,
And say to thee, "Here we are "'?
Who hath imparted understanding to thy reins,
And given intelligence to thy mind?
Who numbereth the clouds in wisdom?
Hast thou given the horse strength?

f-last thou taught him tc bound like the locust?

He paweth in the valley; he exulteth in his strength,

And turneth not back from the sword.
Against him rattleth the quiver,
The flaning spear, and the lance.
With rage and fury he devoureth the ground,
He standeth not still when the trumpet soundeth.
He saith among the trumpets, Aha! aha!

4. TRUE WISDOM.- -Job, translated by Rev. G. R. IVoyes
WVIERE shall wisdom be found?
And where is the place of understanding?
MIan knoweth not the price thereof;
Nor can it be found in the land of the living.
The deep saith, It is not in me;
And the sea saith, It is not tvith me.
It cannot be gotten for gold,
Nor shall silver be weighed out as the price thereof.
It cannot be purchased with the gold of Ophir,
With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
Gold and crystal are not to be compared with it;
Nor can it be purchased with jewels of fine gold.
No mention shall be made of coral, or of crystal,
For wisdom is more precious than pearls.
The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it,
Nor can it be purchased with the purest gold.
Whence, then, cometh wisdom?
And where is the place of understanding?
Since it is hidden from the eyes of all the living
And kept close from the fowls of the air.
The realms of Death say,
WVe have heard only a rumor of it with our ears.
God alone knoweth the way to it;
He alone knoweth its dwelling-place.
For He seeth to the ends of the earth,
And surveyeth all things under the whole Heaven
When lIe gave the winds their weight,
And adjusted the waters by measure, -
When He prescribed laws to the rain,
And a path to the glittering thunderbolt- -
Then did He see it, and make it known;

He es'ablished it, and searched it out;
But he said unto man,
Behold! the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;
And to depart from evil, that is understanding.

The Lord looketh down from Heaveni;
He beholcleth all the children of men;
From His dwelling-place I-Ie beholdeth all the inhabitants of the earth
He, that formed the hearts of all,
And observeth all their works.
A King is not saved by the number of his forces,
Nor a hero by the greatness of his strength.
The horse is a vain thing for safety,
Nor can he deliver his master by his great strength.
Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him,
Upon them that trust in His goodness;
To save them from the power of death,
And keep them alive in faLmine.
The hope of our souls is in the Lord;
He is our help and our shield.
Yea, in Him doth our heart rejoice;
Tn His holy name we have confidence.

air and space are wanting to each for her development.  Rome begins
to perplex Carthage, and Carthage is an eyesore to Rome. Seated on
opposite banks of the Mediterranean, the two cities look each other in
the face. The sea no longer keeps them apart.  Europe and Africa
weigh upon each other. Like two clouds surcharged with electricity
they impend. With their contact must come the thunder-shock.
The catastrophe of this stupendous drama is at hand. What actors
are met!   Two races,- that of merchants and mariners, that of
laborers and soldiers; two Nations, - the one dominant by gold,
g,3 other by steel; two Republics, --the one theocratic, the other
aristocratic. Rome and Carthage! Rome with her army, Carthage
with her fleet; Carthage, old, rich and crafty,- Rome, young, poor,
and robust; the past and the future; the spirit of discovery, and the
spirit of conquest; the genius of commerce, the demon of war; the
East and the South on one side, the West and the North on the
other; in short, two worlds,--the civilization of Africa, and the
civilization of Europe. They measure each other from head to foot.
They gather all their forces. Gradually the war kindles. The world
takes fire. These colossal powers are locked in deadly strife. Car
thage has crossed the Alps; Rome, the seas. The two Nations, personified in two men, Hannibal and Scipio, close with each other,

2. THE DRONES OF THE COMMUNITY. --Percy Bysshe Shellcy.
THOSE gilded flies
That, basking in the sunshine of a Court,
Fatten on its corruption - what are they?
The drones of the community! they feed
On the mechanic's labor; the starved hind
For them compels the stubborn glebe to yield
Its unshared harvests; and yon squalid form,
Leaner than fleshless misery, that wastes
A sunless life in the unwholesome mine,
Drags out in labor a protracted death,
To glut their grandeur. Many faint with toil,
That few may know the cares and woe of sloth.
Whence, think'st thou, kings and parasites arose?
VWhence that unnatural line of drones, who heap
Toil and unvanquishable penury
On those who build their palaces, and bring
Their daily bread? - From vice, black, loathsome vice;
From rapine, madness, treachery, and wrong;
From all that genders misery, and makes
Of earth this thorny wilderness; from lust,
Revenge, and murder. - And, when Reason's voiceLoud as the voice of nature, shall have waked
The Nations; and mankind perceive that.vice
Is discord, war, and misery, -  that virtue
Is peace, and happiness, and harmony;
When man's maturer nature shall disdain
The playthings of its childhood; -kingly glare
Will lose its power to dazzle; its authority
Will silently pass by; the gorgeous throne
Shall stand unnoticed in the regal hall,
Fast falling to decay; whilst falsehood's trade
Shall be as hateful and unprofitable
As that of truth is now.
Where is the fame
Which the vain-glorious mighty of the earth
Seek to eternize?  0! the faintest sound
From time's light foot-fall, the minutest wave
That swells the flood of.ages, whelms in nothing
The unsubstantial bubble. Ay! to-day

That scatters multitudes. To-imorrow comes

That mandate is a taunder-peal that died
In ages past; that gaze, a transient flash
On which the midnight closed; and on that arm

3. CIESAR'S PASSAGE OF THE RTTBICON. --James Sheridan Knowles
A GENTLEMAN, Mr. Chairman, speaking of Caesar's benevolent dis.
position, and of the reluctance with which he entered into the civil
war, observes, " How long did he pause upon the brink of the Rubicon!"   How came he to the brink of that river? How dared he
cross it? Shall private men respect the boundaries of private property, and shall a man pay no respect to the boundaries of his
3ountry's rights?  IHow dared he cross that river?  0! but he
paused upon the brink. He should have perished upon the brink ere
he had crossed it! Why did he pause? Why does a man's heart
palpitate when he is on the point of committing an unlawful deed?
Why does the very murderer, his victim sleeping before him, and his
glaring eye taking the measure of the blow, strike wide of the mortal
part? Because of conscience!'T was that made Caesar pause upon
the brink of the Rubicon.  Compassion! What compassion? The
compassion of an assassin, that feels a momentary shudder, as his
weapon begins to cut! Caesar paused upon the brink of the Rubicon!
What was the Rubicon? The boundary of Caesar's province. From
what did it separate his province? From his country. Was that
country a desert? No: it was cultivated and fertile, rich and populous! Its sons were men of genius, spirit, and generosity,! Its
daughters were lovely, susceptible, and chaste! Friendship was its
inhabitant!  Love was its inhabitant!  Domestic affection was its
inhabitant! Liberty was its inhabitant! All bounded by the stream
of the Rubicon! What was Caesar, that stood upon the bank of that
stream? A traitor, bringing war and pestilence into the heart of that
country! No wonder that he paused, - no wonder if, his imagination wrought upon by his conscience, he had beheld blood instead-of
water, and heard groans instead of murmurs! No wonder, if -some
gorgon horror had turned him into stone upon the spot! But no! -
he cried, "'The die is cast!"  He plunged! - he crossed! - and
Rome was free no more!

an adventurer whom they fear, and obey a power which they hate:
we serve a monarch whom we love --  a God whom we adore. Whene'er they move in anger, desolation tracks their prqgress!  Whene'er

they come but to improve our state, enlarge our thoughts, and free lu

pride! They offer us their protection: yes, such protection as vultures

to barter all of good we have enhanced and proved, for the desperate
chance of something better which they promise. Be our plain answer
this: -The throne we honor is the People's choice; the laws we
reverence are our brave fathers' legacy; the faith we follow teaches
us to live in bonds of charity with all mankind, and die with hope of
bliss beyond the grave. Tell your invaders this; and tell them, too,
we seek no change, --and, least of all, such change as they wouldbring us!

And bristling with rebellion; - lawless nobles
And breadless serfs; England fomenting discord,
Austria, her clutch on your dominion; Spain
Forging the prodigal gold of either Ind
To armed thunderbolts. The Arts lay dead;
Trade rotted in your marts; your Armies mutinous,
Your Treasury bankrupt. Would you now revoke
Your trust, so be it! and I leave you, sole,
Supremest Monarch of the mightiest realm,
From Ganges to the Icebergs. Look without, -
No foe not humbled! Look within, - the Arts
Quit, for our schools, their old Hesperides,
The golden Italy! while throughout the veins
Of your vast empire flows in strengthening tides
Trade, the calm health of Nations! Sire, I know
That men have called me cruel;I am not;- I am just!  I found France rent asunder
The rich men despots, and the poor banditti;
Sloth in the mart, and schism within the temple

B CROIWELL ON THE DEATH OF CHARLES THE FIRST.--Orzginal adaptarion
from Sir E. Bulwer Lytton.
By what law fell King Charles?  By all the laws
He left us! And I, Cromwell, here proclaim it.
Sirs, let us, with a calm and sober eye,
Look on the spectre of this ghastly deed.
Who spills man's blood, his shall by man be shed!
T is Heaven's first law; to that law we had come, -
None other left us. Who, then, caused the strife
That crimsoned Naseby's field, and Marston's moor
It was the Stuart; - so the Stuart fell!
A victim, in the pit himself had digged!
He died not, Sirs, as hated Kings have died,
In secret and in shade, - no eye to trace
The one step from their prison to their pall;
He died i' the eyes of Europe, - in the face
Of the broad Heaven; amidst the sons of England,
Whom he had outraged; by a solemn sentence,
Passed by a solemn Court. Does this seem guilt?
You pity Charles!'t is well; but pity more
The tens of thousand honest humble men,
Who, by the tyranny of Charles compelled
To draw the sword, fell butchered in the field!
Good Lord! when one man dies who wears a Crown,
How the earth trembles, - how the Nations gape,
Amazed and awed! - but when that one man's victims
Poor worms, unclothed in purple, daily die,
In the grim cell, or on the groaning gibbet,
Or on the civil field, ye pitying souls
Drop not one tear from your indifferent eyes!
lHe would have stretched his will
O'er the unlimited empire of men's souls,
Fettered the Earth's pure air, - for freedom is
That air, to honest lips, - and here he lies.
In dust most eloquent, to after time
A never-silent oracle for Kings!
Was this the hand that strained within its grasp
So haught a sceptre? - this the shape that wore
DMajesty like a garment? Spurn that clay, -
475THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
It can resent not; speak of royal crimes,
And it can frown not; - schemeless lies the brain
Whose thoughts were sources of such fearful deeds.
What things are we, O Lord, when, at thy will,
A worm like this could shake the mighty world!
A few years since, and in the port was moored
A bark to far Columbia's forests bound;
And I was one of those indignant hearts
Panting for exile in the thirst for freedom.
Then, that pale clay (poor clay; that was a King!)
Forbade my parting, in the wanton pride
Of vain command, and with a fated sceptre
Waved back the shadow of the death to come.
Here stands that baffled and forbidden wanderer,
Loftiest amid the wrecks of ruined empire,
Beside the coffin of a headless King!
He thralled my fate, - I have prepared his doom;
He made me captive, - lo! his narrow cell!
So hands unseen do fashion forth the earth
Of our firail schemes into our funeral urns;
So, walking dream-led in Life's sleep, our steps
Move blindfold to the scaffold or the Throne!
7 PROCREATIVE VIRTUE OF GREAT EXAMPLES. -Lord Byron.
WE will not strike for private wrongs alone.
Such are for. selfish passions and rash men,
But are unworthy a tyrannicide.
We must forget all feelings save the one;
We must resign all passions save our purpose;
We must behold no object save our country,--
And only look on death as beautiful,
So that the sacrifice ascend to Heaven,
And draw clown freedom on her evermore.
" But if we fail-? "  They never fail who die
in a great cause! The block may soak their gore'
Their heads may sodden in the sun; their limbs
Be strung to city gates and castle walls;--
But still their spirit walks abroad. Though years
Elapse, and others share as dark a doom,
They but augment the deep and sweeping thoughts
WVhich overpower all others, and conduct
The world, at last, to freedom? What were we,

And so has Nature been commissioned to render up her secrets and

A mighty grave that Luxury has dug,
To rid the other realms of pestilence!

They want a sycophant, and he wants slaves.

Of courtesy and high companionship,
This day, as if the Heavens had stamped me black,
Turned on their heel, just at the point of fate,
Left me a mockery in the rabble's midst,
And followed their Plebeian Consul, Cicero!

And it has failed me - vanished from my grasp,

11. CATILINE'S DEFIANCE. -Rev. George Croly.
The scene, in Croly's tragedy of " Catiline," from which the following is taken, represents
tle Roman Senate in session, Lictors present, a Consul in the chair, and Cicero on the floor as
the prosecutor of Catiline and his fellow-conspirators. Catiline enters, and takes his seat on
the Senatorial bench, whereupon the Senators go over to the other side. Cicero repeats his
eharges in Catiline's presence; and the latter rises and replies, " Conscript Fathers, I do not
rise," &amp;c. Cicero, in his rejoinder, produces proofs, and exclaims: -
"Tried and convicted traitor! Go from Rome!"
Catiline haughtily tells the Senate to make the murder as they make the law. Cicero directs
an officer to give up the record of Catiline's banishment. Catiline then utters those words: -
"Banished from Rome." &amp;c.; but when he tells the Consul,
" He dares not touch a hair of Catiline,"
the Consul reads the decree of his banishment, and orders the Lidtors to drive the " traitor"
from the temple.  Catiline, furious at being thus baffled, catches at the word " traitor," anld
terminates the scene with his audacious denunciationi,--" Here I devote your Senate." &amp;c
At the close, he rushes through the portal, as the Lictors and Senators crowd upon him.
CONSCRIPT FATHERS!
I do not rise to waste the night in words;
Let that Plebeian talk;'t is not my trade;
But here I stand for right, -    let him  show proofs, -
For Roman right; though none, it seems, dare stand
To take their share with me.      Ay, cluster there!
Cling to your master, judges, Romans, slaves!
His charge is false;--I dare him        to his proofs.
You have my answer.       Let my actions speak!
But this I will avow, that I have scorned,
And still do scorn, to hide my sense of wrong!
Who brands me on the forehead, breaks my sword,
Or lays the bloody scourge upon my back,
Wrongs me not half so much as he who shuts
The gates of honor on me, - turning out
The Roman from      his birthright; and, for what?
[Looking round him.

And, having wound their loathsome track to the top,

Unpedestalled, but on his lowly grave,
Than if I towered upon a monument
High as the clouds with rotten infamy!
13. LOOCIEL'S WARNING.- Thomas CampOtnl
Locnt-el, a Highland chieftain, while on his march to join the PIretender, is met by o:,e of t.
Highland seers, or prophets, who warns him to return, and not incur the ccrthin rmin which
awaits the unfortunate prince and his followers, on the field of Culloden.
Seer. Lochiel, Lochiel, beware of the day
When the Lowlands shall meet thee in battle array'.
For a field of the dlead rushes red on my sight,
And the clans of (Julloden are scattered in fight:
They rally, they bleed, for their country and. Crown
Woe, woe, to the riders that trample them down!
Proud Cumberland prances, insulting the slain,
And their hoof-beaten bosorns are trod to the plain.
But hark! through the fast-flashing lightning of war,
What steed to the desert flies frantic and far?'T is thine, 0 Glenullin! whose bride shall await,
Like a love-lighted watch-fire, all night at the gate.
A steed comes at morning: no rider is there;
But its bridle is red with the sign of despair'
Weep, Albin! to death and captivity led!
O! weep! but thy tears cannot number the dead
For a merciless sword on Culloden shall wave -
Culloden, that reeks with the blood of the brave!
Lochiel. Go preach to the coward, thou death-tellitg seer.
Or, if gory Culloden so dreadful appear,
Draw, dotard, around thy old wavering sight,
This mantle, to cover the phantoms of fright!
Seer. Ha!.augh'st thou, Lochiel, my vision to scorn  
Proud bird of the mountain, thy plume shall be torn'
S', rushed the bold eagle exultingly forth
Qq~8THE STANDARD SPEAKFd~.
Frolm hIis home in the dark-rolling clouds of the North?
Lo! the death-shot of foemen out-speeding, he rode
Companionless, bearing destruction abroad;
But down let him stoop from his havoc on high'
Ah! home let him speed, for the spoiler is nigh.
Why flames the far summit?  Why shoot to the blast
Those embers, like stars from the firmament cast?'T is the fire-shower of ruin, all dreadfully driven
From his eyry, that beacons the darkness of Heaven.
O, crested Lochiel! the peerless in might,
WVhose banners arise on the battlements' height,
Heaven's fire is around thee, to blast and to burn;
Return to thy dwelling! all lonely return!
For the blackness of ashes shall mark where it stood,
And a wild mothler scream o'er her famishing brood'
Lochiel. False wizard, avaunt! I have marshalled my cl.ta:
Their swords are a thousand, - their bosonms are one!
They are true to the last of their blood and their breath,
And like reapers descend to the harvest of death.
Then welcome be Cumberland's steed to the shock!
Let him dash his proud foam like a wave on the rock!
But woe to his kindred, and woe to his cause,
When Albin her claymore indignantly draws!
When her bonneted chieftains to victory crowd,
Clanranald the dauntless, and Moray the proud,
All plaided and plumed in their tartan array -
Seer. Lochiel! Lochiel! beware of the day!
For, dark and despairing, my sight I may seal,
But man cannot cover what God would reveal.'T is the sunset of life gives me mystical lore,
And coming events cast their shadows before.
I tell thee, Culloden's dread echoes shall ring
With the bloodhounds that bark for thy fugitive King.
Lo! anointed by Heaven with the vials of wrath,
Behold, where he flies on his desolate path!
Now in darkness and billows he sweeps from my sight,
Rise! rise! ye wild tempests, and cover his flight! -'T is finished. Their thunders are hushed on the moors
Culloden is lost, and my country deplores.
But where is the iron-bound prisoner?  Where?
For the red eye of battle is shut in despair.
Say, mounts he the ocean-wave, banished, forlorn,
Like a limb from his country cast bleeding and torn I
Ah! no; for a darker departure is near;
The war-drum is muffled, anid black is the bier,
His death-bell is tolling; O! mercy, dispel
Yon sight, that it freezes my spirit to tell!
Life flutters, convulsed, in his quivering limbs
048RIETORICAL AND DRAMATIC.- TAYLOR.
And his blood-streamieg nostril in agony swims!
Accursed be the fagots that blaze at his feet,
Where his heart shall be thrown, ere it ceases to beat,
With the smoke of its ashes to poison the gale -
Lochiel. Down, soothless insulter! I trust not the tale!
For never shall Albin a destiny meet
So black with dishonor, so foul with retreat.
Though my perishing ranks should be strewed in their gore
Like ocean-weeds heaped on the surf-beaten shore
Lochiel, untainted by flight or by chains,
While the kindling of life in his bosom remains,
Shall victor exult, or in death be laid low,
With his back to the field, and his feet to the foe!
And, leaving in battle no blot on his name,
Look proudly to Heaven from the death-bed of fame'
14'HILIP VAN ARTEVELDE'S DEFENCE OF IIIS REBELLION.- ~fenry Tavl'P
You speak of insurrections: bear in mind
Against what rule my father and mryself
Have been insurgent; whom did we supplant? -
There was a time, so ancient records tell,
There were communities, scarce known by name
In these degenerate days, but once far-famed,
Where liberty and justice, hand in hand,
Ordered the common weal; where great men grow
Up to their natural eminence, and none,
Saving the wise, just, eloquent, were great.
Whom may we now call free? whom great. whom wise I
Whom innocent - the free are only they
Whom power makes free to execute all ills
Their hearts imagine; they are only great
Whose passions nurse them from their cradles up
In luxury and lewdness, - whom to see
Is to despise, whose aspects put to scorn
Their station's eminence; the wise, they only
Who wait obscurely till the bolts of Heaven
Shall break upon the land, and give them light
Whereby to walk; the innocent, alas!
Poor Innocency lies where four roads meet,
A stone upon her head, a stake driven through her, --
For who is innocent that cares to live?
The hand of power doth press the very life
Of Innocency out
What, then, remains,
But in the cause of-nature to stand forth,
And turn this fiame of things the right side up?
485THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
F'oi this the hour is come, the sword is drawl,
And tell your masters vainly they resist.
Nature, that slept beneath their poisonous drugs,
Is up and stirring, and from north and south,
From east and west, from England and from France,
From Germany, and Flanders, and Navarre,
Shall stand against them like a beast at bay.
The blood that they have shed will hide no longer
In the blood-sloken soil, but cries to Heaven.
Their cruelties and wrongs against the poor
Shall quicken into swarms of venomous snakes,
And hiss through all the earth, till o'er the earth,
That ceases then from hissings and from groans,
Rises the song - How are the mighty fallen!
And by the peasant's hand! Low lie the proud!
And smitten with the weapons of the poor -
The blacksmith's hammer and the woodman's axe!
Their tale is told; and for that they were rich,
And robbed the poor; and for that they were strong,
And scourged the weak; and for that they made laws
Which turned the sweat of labor's brow to blood, -
For these their sins the nations cast them out!
These things come to pass
From small beginnings, because God is just.
l5 DUTI TO ONE'S COUNTRY.--Hannah Ilore. Born, 1744; doed 183
OuR country is a whole, my Publius,
Of which we all are parts; nor should a citizen
Regard his interests as distinct from hers;
No hopes or fears should touch his patriot soul,
But what affect her honor or her shame.
E'en when in hostile fields he bleeds to save her,'T is not his blood he loses,'t is his country's;
He only pays her back a debt he owes.
To her he's bound for birth and education;
Her laws secure him from domestic feuds,
And from the foreign foe her arms protect him.
She lends him honors, dignity, and rank,
His wrongs revenges, and his merit pays;
And, like a tender and indulgent mother,
Loads him with comforts, and would make his state
As blessed as natura.and the gods designed it.
Such gifts, my son, have their alloy of pain,
And let the unworthy wretch, who will not bear
His portion of the public burthen, lose
The advantages it yields - let him retir6
From the dear blessings of a social life

RHETORICAL AND DRAM-,TIC. - - KNOWLES.
And from the sacred laws which guard those blessings,
Renounce the civilized abodes of man,
With kindred brutes one common shelter seek
In horrid wilds, and dens, and dreary caves,
And with their shaggy tenants share the spoil;
Or, if the shaggy hunters miss their prey,
From scattered acorns pick a scanty meal;Far from the sweet civilities of life,
There let him live, and vaunt his wretched freedom,
While we, obedient to the laws that guard us,
Guard them, and live or die, as they decree.
16. ST. PIERRE TO FERRARDO. -James Sheridan Knowles.
St. Pierre, having possessed himself of Ferrardo's dagger, compels him to sign a confessioa
Omi hiU own lips, of his villany.
KNOW you me, Duke? Know you the peasant boy,
Whom, fifteen years ago, in evil hour,
You chanced to cross upon his native hills,
In whose quick eye you saw the subtle spirit,
Which suited you, and tempted it? He took
Your hint, and followed you to Mantua
Without his father's knowledge, - his old father,
Who, thinking that he had a prop in him
Man could not rob him of, and Heaven would spare,
Blessed him one night, ere he lay down to sleep,
And, -wakinD in the morning, found him gone!
[Ferrardo tries to rise
Move not, or I shall move! You know me.
0, yes! you trained me like a cavalier, -
You did, indeed! You gave me masters, Duke,
And their instructions quickly I took up,
As they did lay them down! I got the start
Of my cotemporaries! - not a youth
Of whom could read, write, speak, command a weapon,
Or rule a horse, with me! You gave me all,All the equipments of a man of honor, -
But you did find a use for me, and made
A slave, a profligate, a pander, of me!  [Ferrardo rasing
I charge you keep your seat!Ten thousand ducats?
What, Duke! Is such your offer?  Give me, Duke,
The eyes that looked upon my father's face,
The hands that helped my father to his wish,
The feet that flew to do my father's will,
rhe heart that bounded at my father's voice, -
And say that Mantua were built of ducats,
And I could be its Duke at cost of theseMORAL AND DIDACTIC.-- HUGO.
when war shliall seem as absurd and impossible between Paris tnd Lonion, between Petersbuir- and Berlin, as between Rouen * and Amiens,i
between Boston and Philadelphia.  A day will come when bullets
and bombs shall be replaced by ballots, by the universal suffrages cf
the People, by the sacred arbitrament of a great sovereign Senato
which shall be to Eurcpe what the Parliament is to England, what
the Diet is to Germany, what the Legislative Assembly is to Franlce.
A day will come when a cannon slall be exhibited in our museums,
as an instrument of torture is now, and men shall marvel that such
things could be. A day will come when' shall be seen those two
immense groups, the United States of America and the United States
of Europe, in face of each other, extending hand to hand over the
ocean, exchanging their products, their commerce, their industry, their
arts, their genius, - clearing the earth, colonizing deserts, and ameliorating creation, under the eye of the Creator.
And, for that day to arrive, it is not necessary that four hundred
years should pass: for we live in a fast time; we live in a current of
events and of ideas the most impetuous that has ever swept along the
Nations; and at an epoch when a year may sometimes effect the work
of a century. And, to you I appeal,-- French, English, Germans,
Russians, Sclaves, Europeans, Americans, - what have we to do to
hasten the coming of that great day?  Love one another! To love
one another. in this immense work of pacification, is the best way of
aiding God. For God wills that this sublime end should be abccomplished.  And, see, for the attainment of it, what, on all sides, He is
doing!  See what discoveries He causes to spring from the human
brain, all tending to the great end of peace! What progress! What
sinplifications! How does Nature, more and more, suffer herself to
be vanquished by man! How does matter become, more and more.
the slave of intelligence and the servant of civilization! How do the
causes of war vanish with the causes of suffering! I-How are remote
Nations brought near! How is distance abridged! And how does
this abridgment make men more like brothers! Thanks to railroads,
Europe will soon be no larger than France was in the middle ages!
Thanks to steamships, we now traverse the ocean more easily than we
could the Mediterranean once!.Yet a few years more, and the elec.
tric thread of concord shall encircle the globe, and unite the world!
When I consider all that Providence has done for us, and all that
politicians have done against us, a melancholy consideration presents
itself. We learn, from the statistics of Europe, that she now spends
annually, for the maintenance of her armies, the sum of five hundred
millions of dollars. If, for the last thirty-two years, this enormous
sum had been expended in the interests of peace,--America meanwhile aiding Europe, - know you what would have happened? The
itce of the world would have been changed.  Isthmuses would have
been out through; rivers would have been channelled; mountains

I saw a new-made grave in Mantua,
And on the head-stone read my father's name!--
To seek me, doubtless, hither he had come, -
To seek the child that had deserted him,And died here, ere he found me.
Heaven can tell how far he wandered else!
Upon that grave I knelt an altered man,
And; rising thence, I fled from Mantua; --nor had returnobd
But tyrant hunger drove me back again

17 WILLIAM TELL ON SWITZERLAND.-- Adaptation from J. S. Knowles
ONCE Switzerland was free! With what a pride
I used to walk these hills, - look up to iEeaven,
And bless G-od that it was so! It was free
From end to end, from cliff to lake't was free!
Free as our torrents are, that leap our rocks,
And plough our valleys, without asking leave;
Or as our peaks, that wear their caps of snow
In very presence of the regal sun!
How happy was I in it, then! I loved
Its very storms. Ay, often have I sat
In my.boat at night, when midway o'er the lake.
The stars went out, and down the mountain gorge
The wind came roaring, - I have sat and eyed
The thunder breaking from his cloud, and smiled
To see him shake his lightnings o'er my head,
And think I had no master save his own.
You know the jutting cliff, round which a track
Up hither winds, whose base is but the brow
To such another one, with scanty room
For two a-breast to pass? O'ertaken there
By the mountain blast, I've laid me flat along.
And while gust followed gust more furiously,
As if to sweep me o'er the horrid brink,RHETORICAL AND DRAMATIC. - BRUEYS.
And I have thought of other lands, whose storms
Are summer flaws to those of mine, and just
Have wished me there;--the thought that mine was free
Has checked that wish, and I have raised my head,
And cried in thraldom to that furious wind,
Blow on! This is the land of liberty!
15. WILLIAM TELL AMONG THE MOUNTAINS.--J. S. Knowles.
YE crags and peaks, I'm with you once again!
I hold to you the hands you first beheld,
To show they still are free. Methinks I hear
A spirit in your echoes answer me,
And bid your tenant welcome to his home
Again!- 0 sacred forms, how proud you look!
How high you lift your heads into the sky!
HIow huge you are! how mighty, and how free!
Ye are the things that tower, that shine, - whose smile
Makes glad, whose frown is terrible, whose forms,
Robed or unrobed, do all the impress wear
Of awe divine. Ye guards of liberty,:
I'm with you once again! --I call to you
With all my voice! --I hold my hands to you,
To show they still are free. I rush to you
As though I could embrace you!
-   Scaling yonder peak,
I saw an eagle wheeling near its brow
O'er the abyss:- his broad-expanded wings
Lay calm and motionless upon the air,
As if he floated there without their aid,
By the sole act of his unlorded will,
That buoyed him proudly up. Instinctively
I bent my bow; yet kept he rounding still
His airy circle, as in the delight
Of measuring the ample range beneath
And round about; absorbed, he heeded not
The death that threatened him. I could not shoot!-'T was liberty! - I turned my bow aside,
And let him soar away!

21. BRUTUS AND TITUS.-Nathaniel Lee.
There are some noble touches in the following dialogue, from Lee's tragedy of "Lucius
Junius Brutus," although from the pen of a poet who mingled the extravagance of a madman
with the inspirations of genius. Lee was born in Hertfordshire, England, in 1651, and died in
1692. He was for some time confined in a mad-house, being for nearly four years a raving
waniac.
Brutus. Well, Titus, speak; how is it with thee now?
I would attend a while this mighty motion,
Wait till the tempest were quite overblown,
That I might take thee in the calm of nature,
With all thy gentler virtues brooding on thee:
So hushed a stillness, as if all the gods
Looked down and listened to what we were saying:
Speak, then, and tell me, 0 my best beloved,
Mly son, my Titus! is all well again?
Titus. So well, that saying how must make it nothing.
So well, that I could wish to die this moment,
For so my heart, with powerful throbs, persuades me
That were indeed to make you reparation;
That were, my Lord, to thank you home -   to die I
And that, for Titus, too, would be most happy.
Brutus. IHow's that, my son? would death for thee be happy
Titus. Most certain, Sir; for in my grave I'scape
All those affronts which I, in life, must look for;
All those reproaches which the eyes, the fingers,
And tongues of Rome, will daily cast upon me,
4rom whon to a soul so sensible as mine,
492RHETORICAL AND DRAIATIC. --- LEE.
Each single scorn would be far worse than dying.
besides, I'scape the stings of my own conscience,
Which will forever rack me with remembrance,
Haunt me by day, and torture me by night,
Casting my blotted honor in the way,
Where'er my melancholy thoughts shall guide me.
Brutus. But, is not death a very dreadful thing?
Titus. Not to a mind resolved.  No, Sir; to me
It seems as natural as to be born.
Groans and convulsions,,and discolored faces,
Friends weeping round us, crapes, and obsequies,
Make it a dreadful. thing; the pomp of death
Is far more terrible than death itself.
Yes, Sir; I call the powers of Heaven to witness,
Titus dares die, if so you have decreed;
Nay, he shall die with joy to honor Brutus..Brutus. Thou perfect glory of the Junian race!
Let me endear thee once more to my bosom,
Groan an eternal farewell to thy soul;
Instead of tears, weep blood, if possible;--
Blood, the heart-blood of Brutus, on his child'
For thou must die, my Titus; die, my son!
I swear, the gods have doomed thee to the grave.
The violated genius of thy country
Bares his sad head, and passes sentence on thee.
This morning sun, that lights thy sorrows on
To the tribunal of this horrid vengeance,
Shall never see thee more!
Titus.                   Alas! my Lord,
Why art thou moved thus? Why am I worth thy sorrow a
Why should the godlike Brutus shake to doom me?
Why all these trappings for a traitor's hearse?
The gods will have it so.
Brutus.               They will, my Titus;
Nor Heaven nor earth can have it otherwise.
Nay, Titus, mark! the deeper that I search,
Mly harassed soul returns the more confirmed.
Methinks I see the very hand of Jove
Moving the dreadful wheels of this affair, -
Like a machine, they whirl thee to thy fate.
It seems as if the gods had pre6rdained it,
To fix the reeling spirits of the People,
And settle the loose liberty of Rome.'T is fixed; 0, therefore, let not fancy dupe thee!
So fixed thy death, that't is not in the power
Of gods or men to save, thee from the axe.
Titus. The.axe! O, Heaven! must I, then, fall so baselyt
What! Shall I perish by the common hangman?
493TIHE STANI)AITD SPEAKER.
BrzUtus. If thou deny me this, thou giv'st me nothing.
Yes, TittLs, since the gods have so decreed
That I must lose thee, I will take the advantage
Of thy important fate; cement Rome's flaws,
And heal her wounded freedom with thy blood.
I will ascend myself the sad tribunal,
And sit upon my son - on thee, my Titus:
Behold thee suffer all the shame of death,
The lictor's lashes, bleed before the people;
Then, with thy hopes and all thy youth upon thee,
See thy head taken by the common axe,
Without a groan, without one pitying tear
(If that the gods can hold me to my purpose),
To make my justice quite transcend example.
Titus. Scourged like a bondman! Ha! a beaten slave!
But I deserve it all; yet, here I fail;
The image of this suffering quite unmans me.
-0, Sir! O, Brutus! must I call you father,
Yet have no token of your tenderness?
No sign of mercy? What! not bate me that?
Can you resolve on all the extremity
Of cruel rigor? To behold me, too;
To sit, unmoved, and see me whipped to death!
Is this a father?
Ah, Sir, why should you make my heart suspect
That all your late compassion was dissembled?
How can I think that you did ever love me?
Brutus. Think that I love thee, by my present passion,
By these unmanly tears, these earthquakes here;
These sighs, that twitch the very strings of life;
Think that no other cause on earth could move me
To tremble thus, to sob, or shed a tear,
Nor shake my solid virtue from her point,

12 CATO'S SOLILOQUY ON IMMORTALITY. -Addison. Born, 1672 died, 17 9.
IT must be so. - Plato, thou reasonest well
Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,
This longing after immortality?
Or whence this secret dread, and inward horror,
Of falling into naught? Why shrinks the soul
Back on herself, and startles at destruction?'T is the divinity that stirs within us,'T is Heaven itself, that points out an hereafter,
And intimates eternity to man.
Eternity! - thou pleasing, dreadful thought I!
Through what variety of untried being,
Through what new scenes and changes must we pass!
The wide, the unbounded prospect lies before me;
But shadows, clouds and darkness, rest upon it.
Here will I hold. If there's a Power above us, -
And that there is, all Nature cries aloud
Through all her works,- He must delight in virtue'
And that which He delights in must be happy.
But when? or where? This world was made for Cmsar.
I'm weary of conjectures, - this must end'em.
Thus am I doubly armed.  My death and life.
My bane and antidote, are both before me.
This * in a moment brings me to my end;
But this t informs me I shall never die.
The soul, secure in her existence, smiles
At the drawn dagger, and defies its point.
The stars shall fade away, the sun himself
Grow dim with age, and Nature sink in years,
But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth,
Unhurt amid the war of elements,
The wreck of matter, and the crush of worlds.

Cassius. That you have wronged me, doth appear in this
You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella,
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
Wherein my letters (praying on his side,
Because I knew the man) were slighted off.

That every nice offence should bear its comment.

Are much condemned to have an itching palm'
To sell and mart your offices for gold,
To lrndeservers.

You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last!
Bru. The name of Cassius honors this corruption.
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head
Cas. Chastisement!
Bru. Remember March, the Ides of March remember
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?'What villain touched his body, that did stab,
And not for justice? - What! shall one of us,
That struck the foremost man of all this world,
But for supporting robbers,- shall we now

And sell the mighty space of our large honors

guishing  features of the present collection are, the' -usua
Ttn distirguishing features of the present collection are, the unusual
variety and methodical arrangement of the materials; a comprehensive
grouping, such as has not hitherto been attempted, of exercises from the
most celebrated orators and popular debaters of ancient and modern times;
the allotment of a liberal space to original translations from the French
and other languages; and the introduction of notes, explanatory and biographical, with the dates of the birth and death of authors. Side by side
with those pieces of acknowledged excellence, that justify the title of the
work, will be found a large number that are now, for the first time, presented as exercises for recitation and declamation. In tihe case of selections, care has been taken to collate them with the latest and most
authentic editions of the works from which they are extracted; and thus
many current errors and mutilations have been avoided.
Of the British parliamentary specimens, many are valuable, not only
as models of style, but as illustrating the early history of our own country.
MIvuch original research has been bestowed on this part of the volume.
The privilege of occasional compression being indispensable, it has been
exercised with as scrupulous a regard as possible to the integrity of the
text.  Most of the extracts from Chatham, Pitt, Fox, and Sheridan:
nearly all from Burke, Grattan, Curran, and Brougham; all but one from
Canning and Macaulay; and all from Vane, MIeredith, Wilkes, Sheil,
Croker, Talfourd, Peel, Cobden, Palmerston, Russell and others, are now,
for the first time, introduced into a " Speaker."'
Among the familiar materpieces of American oratory will be four.d
many new extracts, not unworthy of the association. They belong to the
whole country, and no sectional bias has influenced the choice.
Of the brilliant specimens of the senatorial eloquence of France, all but
two have been translated expressly for this work. In the other departments of the volume, there has also been a considerable expenditure of
original editorial labor; all the highly effective exercises from MIassillon,
Hug', Pichat, Mickiewicz, and many others, having been translated;
all those from Homer, Schiller, Delavigne, Bulwer, Mazziui, Kossuth, andTTHE STANDARD SPEAKER.

3. RTHE PEACE CONGRESS OF TIIE UNION.-- Edward Averett. June 17th, 1850.
AMO:NG the great ideas of the age, we are authorized in reckoning
a growing sentiment in favor of peace. An impression is unquestionazbly gaining strenngt in the world, that public war is no less reproachtiul to our Christian civilization than the private wars of the feudal,hiefs in the middle ages.'A Congress of Nations begins to be regarded as a practicable measure.  Statesmen, and orators, and philanthropists, are flattering themselves that the countries of Europe,
which lihave existed as independent sovereignties for a thousand years,
and have never united in one movement since the Crusades, may be
brouglht into some community of action for this end.
They are calling conventions, and digesting projects, by which
Empires, Kingdoms, and Republics, inhabited by different races of
mnen, - tribes of Slavonian, Teutonic, Latin, and mixed descent, -
speaking different languages, believing different creeds,- Greeks, Catholics, and Protestants, men who are scarcely willing to live on the
same earth with each other, or go to the same Heaven, -,can be made
to agree to some great plan of common umpirage. If, while these
sanguine projects are pursued, -while we are thinking it worth
while to compass sea and land in the expectation of bringing these
jarring nationalities into some kind of union, in order to put a stop to
war, -if, I say, at this juncture, the People of these thirty United:trates, most of which are of the average size of a European Kingeom, destined, if they remain a century longer at peace with each
other, to equal in numbers the entire population of Europe; States,
which, drawn together by a general identity of descent, language anid
faith, have not so much formed as grown up into a National Confederation, possessing in its central Legislature, Executive and Judidiary, an efficient tribunal for the arbitration and decision of controversies, - an actual Peace Congress, clothed with all the powers of a

To cast into my teeth. 0, I could weep
My spirit from mine eyes! - There is my dagger,
And here my naked breast; within a heart
Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold;

When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius!

Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.
0 Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb,
That carries anger as the flint bears fire:
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
And straight is cold again.
Cas. Hath Cassius lived
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
When grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him?

25. SPEECI OF CASSIUS, INSTIGATING BRUTUS TO JOIN TIIE CONSrIR%ACT
AGAINST CAESAR. - Shakspeare.
WELL, honor is the subject of my story.
I cannot tell what you, and other men,
Think of this life; but, for my single self,
I had as lief not be, aslive to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
I was born free as Csesar; so were you;
We both have fed as well; and we can both
Endure the winter's cold as well as he;
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
C(esar said to me, "Dar'st thou, Cassius, now,
Leap in with me into this angry flood,
And swim to yonder point? " Upon the word,
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,
And bade him follow; so, indeed, he did.
The torrent roared; and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews; throwing it aside,
And stemming it with hearts of controversy.
But, ere we could arrive the point proposed,
Clesar cried, Ifelp me, Cassius, or I sink!
I, as LEneas, our great ancestor,
Did, from the flames of Troy, upon his shoulder,
The old Anchises bear, so, from the waves of Tiber,
Did I the tired Cwsar: and this man
Is now become a god; and Cassius is
A wretched creature, and must bend his body,
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
And, when the fit was on him, I did mark
How he did shake:'t is true, this god did shake:
His coward lips did from their color fly;
And that same eye, whose bend doth awe the world,
Did lose its lustre: I did hear him groan:
Ay, and that tongue of his, that bade the Romans
Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,
Alas! it cried, Give me some drink, Titinits,
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze &gt;pe,
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world,
And bear the palm alone!
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
Brutus and Caesar; what should be in that Caesar 2
Why should that name be sounded mlore than yours

Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with them,

Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
Upon what meat doth this our Ctesar feed
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed;
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
When went there by an age, since the great flood,
But it was famed with more than with one man?
When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome,
That her wide walls encompassed but one man?
0! you and I have heard our fathers say
There was a Brutus, once, that would have brooked
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome,
As easily as a king!;A,1DINAL WOLSEY, ON BEING CAST OFF BY KING HENRY VIII. U.r
NAY, then, farewell,
I have touched the highest point of all my greatness;
And, from that full meridian of my glory,
I haste now to my setting: I shall fall
Like a bright exhalation in the evening,
And no man see me more.
So farewell to the little good you bear me.
Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!
This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
The tender leaves of hope; to-morrow, blossoms,
And bears his blushing honors thick upon him:
The third day comes a frost, a killing frost;
And, when he thinks, - good, easy man, - full surely
His greatness is a ripening, nips his root,
And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
These many summers in a sea of glory;
But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
At length broke under me; and now has left me,
Weary and old with service, to the mercy
Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.
Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye!
I feel my heart new opened.  O, how wretched
Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favors!
There is, betwixt that smile he would aspire to,
That sweet aspect of princes, and his ruin,
More pangs and feairs than wars or women hate.
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
Never to hope again!

By that sin fell the angels: how can man, then,
The image of his Maker, hope to win by't?

Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not.,

air too much with your hand, thus: but use all gently; for, in the
very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, WIIRLWIND of your paSSion,
you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness.
O! it offends me to the soul, to hear a robustious, periwig-pated fellow,
tear a passion to tatters, - to very rays, - to split the cars of the

inexplicable dumb show and noise. I would have such a fellow

avoid it.
Be not too tame, neither, but let your own discretion bl your tutor;
suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special
observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature; for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, -whose end, both at

your allowance, o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O! there be
players that I have seen play,- and heard others praise and that
highly, - not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent cf

To be -or not to be- that is the question!
Whether't is nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,Or, to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And, by opposing, end them. - To die, - to sleep; -
No more;-- and, by a sleep, to say we end
The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to; -'t is a consummation
Devoutly to be wished! To die;--to sleep;To sleep? perchance to dream; -ay, there's the ruk
For, in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause! There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life:
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, thle law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of the'unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin?
Who would fardels bear,
To groan and sweat under a weary life;
But that the dread of something after death, -
The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, - puzzles the will;
And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;
And enterprises of great pith and moment,
With this regard, their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.THE STANDARD SPEAKER.

Stephen Plum -
Ste. I wish you'd stick to cotton, dad, and get rid of all these
fine, new, silk-and-satin notions of yours! The idea of your idling
away your time, studying parlez vou Fransy! and then getting that
whacking looking-glass, where I seed you making great ugly faces at
yourself! Don't say you did n't,'cause Toby and I catched you at it,
t' other morning. How we did laugh, surely! Ho, ho, ho!
Jas. What you are pleased to call great ugly faces, Sir, were postures and smiles to receive my guests, - and look at the result!
Behold the transmogrified Jasper Plum! Passed into the state of
butterfly, out of the state of grub!
Ste. A butterfly, you?  I say, dad, don't you feel a little stiffish
about the wings?  Ho, ho! butterfly and grub! [Suddenly seriozus.]
Look you, dad; winter and summer, in work and out of work, I can
manage to keep five hundred cotton spinners,- families and all, a
imatter of two thousand poor creatures, - and every man, woman and
child, among'em, has helped to make us rich. For my part, I can't
lift a bit to my mouth, but I ask myself if any of theirs be empty.
No, no! I must live and die among'em; but what need to tell you
so? Don't they love you, and you love them, as dear as dear can be?
Bless your old heart, I know you do! And now, dad, I'11 tell you a
secret. I'n in love.
Jas. In what?
Ste. In love! and I don't mind to tell you another secret,- it's
with a woman!
Jas. In love with a woman!
Ste. Yes; and, now you're in for it, I'11 tell you a third secret,
--I want to marry her off-hand, directly.
Jas. The boy's mad! His brother's marriage has got into his head,
and turned it! You marry? and marry a woman, too? What next,
I wonder?
Ste. Don't be angry, dad; I only want a wife of my own, like
my father before me; so you'd very much oblige me, if you'd just
name the time and keep it.
Jas. Indeed! before I name' the time, Sir, perhaps you'11 condescend to name the woman.
Ste. Ah! now comes the tug. I say, dad, you see that hook
atop of the ceiling, - that's just where you'11 jump to, when you hear
who't is. Well, then, the woman I love, and want to marry, is theTHE STANDARD SPEAKER.
poor factory girl, Martha Gibbs. Now, don't jump! [Hloewng Jasper

Jas. Martha Gibbs! Ha, ha, ha! Come, I like this. There's
some character about such abominable audacity! It tickles one to have
one's hair stand on end! Degenerate offspring! do you want to be the
death of the house of Plum?  And do you think I'11 ever sanction
such an alliance for a son of mine? Never, never! The voice of all
your ancestors exclaims, Never! never!
Ste. Then I wish my ancestors would just speak when they're
spolke to.
Jas. Reflect, rash youth, what was this creature, Martha?  A.
beggar, asking charity!
Ste. No, she asked for wages, and paid you with hard work.
Jas. And who was she?    I ask for her ancestry; she never had
any. I ask for her parents; I don't believe she ever had any.
Ste. Never had a father and mother?  Then warn't she a clever
girl to manage to do without? Ho, ho, ho!
Jas. Reflect like a man, Sir, and don't laugh like a horse! I'11
turn that intriguling hussy, Martha Gibbs, out of the house, this very
day!
Ste. Stop, dad; you don't, you can't mean that?
Jas. I do mean that, and I'11 do it!
Ste. No, you won't; you may save yourself the trouble now, and
the pain afterwards. Martha has given notice; she means to quit the
factory to-morrow morning.
Jas. A pleasant journey to her!
Ste. I hope so,'cause I go along with her.
Jas. What did you say, Sir?
Ste. I go along with her.
Jas. You, Stephen! go and leave - 0, Stephen!
Ste. Perhaps it's best it should be so; long's the day I've seen
my father and brother are ashamed of me.'Jas. Stephen Plum!
Ste. And you'd have me marry a fine lady, who'd be ashamed of
me, too; but I won't.  So, if you won't have us near you, why Martha and I must love you far away.
Jas. Well, I'11 reflect, - let me have time to reflect.
Ste. That's but fair; I'11 give you lots of time. [Looking at his
watch.] I'11 give you five-and-twenty minutes.
Jas, Eh?
Ste Well, I don't mind making it half an hour; now, mind, in
thirty minutes I'11 return for your yes or no. If it s "No," I must
pack up my carpet-bag,'cause I can't go into the wide world without a change of linen. [Exit.]

B0. THE UNION AND ITS GOVERNMENT. - Wm. Gilmore Szmma.
GOVERNMENT
We hold to be the creature of our need,
Having no power but where necessity
Still, under guidance of the Charter, gives it.
Our taxes raised to meet our exigence,
And not for waste or favorites.  Our People
Left free to share the commerce of the world,
Without one needless barrier on their prows.
Our industry at liberty for venture,
Neither abridged nor pampered; and no calling
Preferred before another, to the ruin
Or wrong of either. These, Sir, are my doctrines
[.hey are the only doctrines which shall keep us
From anarchy, and that worst peril yet,
That threatens to dissever, in the tempest,
That married.harmony of hope with power
That keeps our starry Union o'er the storm,
And, in the sacred bond that links our fortunes,
Makes us defy its thunders! Thus in one,
The foreign despot threatens us in vain.
Guizot and Palmerston may fret to see us
Grasping the empires which they vainly coyet,
And stretching forth our trident o'er the seas,
In rivalry with Britain. They may confine,
But cannot chain us. Balances of power,
Framed by corrupt and cunning monarchists,
Weigh none of our possessions; and the seasons
That mark our mighty progress East and West,
Show Europe's struggling millions fondly seeking
The better shores and shelters that are ours.

With sycophantic incense, but in soul

14. TIIE SPIRIT OF THE AGE ADVERSE TO WAR. -Rev. G. C. Becklcith.
WAR will yet cease from the whole earth; for God Himself has said
it shall. As an infidel, I miglht doubt this; but as a Christian, I cannot.  If God has taught anything in the Bible, IHe has taught peace;
if He has promised anything there, He has promised peace, ultiimate
peace, to the whole world; and, unless the night of a godless scepticism
should settle on my soul, I must believe on, and hope on, and work on,
until the Nations, from pole to pole, shall beat their swords into
ploughshares, their spears into pruning-hooks, and learn war no
more.  Yes, Sir; I see, or I think I see, the dawn of that coming day.
I see it in the new and better, spirit of the age. I see it in the Press
the Pulpit, an4[ the School.  I see it in every factory, and steamship,
anid rail-car. I see it in every enterprise of Christian benevolence
and reform.  I see it in all the means of general improvement, in
all the good influences of the age, now at work over the whole earth.
Yes; there is a spirit abroad that can never rest until the war-demon
is hunted from the habitations of men.  The spirit that is now pushing its enterprises and improvements in every direction; the spirit that
is unfurling the white flag of commerce on every sea, and bartering
its commodities in every port; the spirit that is laying every power
of nature, as well as the utmost resources of human ingenuity, under
the largest contributions possible, for the general welfare of mankind;
the spirit that hunts out from your cities' darkest alleys the outcasts
of poverty and crime, for relief and reform; nay, goes down into the
barred and bolted dungeons of penal vengeance, and brings up its
sallous, haggard victims, into the sunlight of a love that pities even
wlhile it smites; the spirit that is everywhere rearing hospitals for
the sick retreats for the insane, and schools that all but teach the
dumb tc soeak, the deaf to hear, and the blind to see; the spirit
that hlarnesses the fire-horse in his iron gear, and sends him panting, with hot but unwearied breath, across empires, and continents,
and seas; the spirit that catches the very lightning of Heaven, and
makes it bear messages, swift,'almost, as thought, from city to city,
from country to country, round the globe; the spirit that subsidizes
all these to the godlike work of a world's salvation, and employs them
to scatter the blessed truths of the Gospel, -thick as leaves of autumn,

49THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
Of their soft countenances, - are the vermin
That haunt a prince's ear with the false buzz
Of villanous assentation. These are they
Who from your mind have flouted every thought
Of the great weal of the People. These are they
Who from your ears have shut the public cry. -
C "Who dares complain of you? "  All dare complain
Behind you; I, before you! Do not think,
Because you load your People with the weight
Of camels, they possess the camel's patience.
A deep groan labors in the nation's heart,
The very calm and stillness of the day
Gives augury of the earthquake. All without
Is as the marble smooth; and all within
Is rotten as the carcass it contains.
Though ruin knock not at the palace gate,
Yet will the palace gate unfold itself
To ruin's felt-shod tread.
Your gorgeous banquets, your high feasts of gold,
WVhich the four quarters of the rifled world
Heap with their ravished luxuries; your pomps,
Your palaces, and all the sumptuousness
Of painted royalty, will melt away,
As in a theatre the glittering scene
Doth vanish with the shifter's magic hand,
And the mock pageant perishes.  My liege,
A single virtuous action hath more worth
Than all the pyramids; and glory writes
A more enduring epitaph upon
One generous deed, than the sarcophagus
In which Sesostris meant to sleep.

For they have yielded to the conqueror.

508RHETORICAL AND -DRAMATIC. - SHIEL.
A race of bonded serfs from sire to sou.
But we, the genuine race of ancient Swiss,
Have kept our freedom, from the first, till now.
Never to princes have we bowed the knee.
What said our fathers when the Emperor
Pronounced a judgment in the Abbey's favor
Awarding lands beyond his jurisdiction?
What was their answer?  This:--" The grant is vold
No Emperor can bestow what is our own;
And if the Empire shall deny us justice,
We can, within our mountains, right ourselves."
Thus spake our fathers; and, shall we endure
The shame and infamy of this new yoke;
And, from the vassal, brook what never king
Dared, in the fulness of his power, attempt?
This soil we have created for ourselves,
By the hard labor of our hands; we've changed
The giant forest, that was erst the haunt
Of savage bears, into a home for man;
Blasted the solid rock; o'er the abyss
Thrown the firm bridge for the way-faring man.
By the possession of a thousand years,
The soil is ours. And, shall an alien lord,
Himself a vassal, dare to venture here,
On our own hearths insult us, and attempt
To forge the chains of bondage for our hands,
And do us shame on our own proper soil?
Is there no help against such wrong as this?
Yes! there's a limit to the despot's power.
When the oppressed looks round in vain for justici
When his sore burden may no more be borne.
With fearless heart, he makes appeal to Heaven,
And thence brings down his everlasting rights,
Which there abide, inalienably his,
And indestructible as are the stars.
Nature's primeval state returns again,
WVhere man stands hostile to his fellow-man;
And, if all other means shall fail his need,
One last resource remains - his own good sword
Our dearest treasures call to us for aid
Against the oppressor's violence; we stand
For country, home, for wives, for children, here

The straitness of the path forbids pursuit.
Now, Gessler, balance thine account with Heaven!
Thou must away fromn earth, - thy sand is run.
I led a peaceful, inoffensive life;My bow was bent on forest game alone,
And my pure soul was free from thoughts of murder,
But thou hast scared me from my dream of peace
The milk of human kindness thou hast turned
To rankling poison in my breast; and made
Appalling deeds familiar to my soul.
He who could make his own child's head his mark
Can speed his arrow to his foeman's heart.
My children dear, my loved and faithful wife,
Must be protected, tyrant, from thy fury! -
When last I drew my bow, with trembling hand,
And thou, with murderous joy, a father forced
To level at his child, - when, all in vain,
WVrithing before thee, I implored thy mercy, -
Then, in the agony of my soul, I vowed
A fearful oath, which met God's ear alone,
That when my bow next winged an arrow's flight,
Its aim should be thy heart. The vow I made,
Amid the hellish torments of that moment,
I hold a sacred debt, and I will pay it.
Thou art my lord, my Emperor's delegate;
Yet would the Emperor not have stretched his power
So far as thou. He sent thee to these Cantons
To deal forth law, - stern law, - for he is angered;
But not to wanton with unbridled will
In every cruelty, with fiend-like joy: -
There is a God to punish and avenge.
Well, I am watching for a noble prey!
Does not the huntsman, with severest toil,
Roam for whole days amid the winter's cold,
Leap wvith a daring bound from rock to rock,
And climb the jagged, slippery steeps, to which
His limbs are gluecl by his own streaming blood,And all this but to gain a wretched chamois?
A far more precious prize is now my aim,
The heart of that dire foe who would dcestroy me.
From my first years of boyhood I have used
The bow, - been practised in the archer's feats;
The bull's eye many a time my shafts have hit,
And many a goodly prize have I brought home,
aWon in tha gaines of skill. This day I'11 malke

Within the whole circumference of the mountains,.10RHETORICAL AND DRAMATIC. - SCIILLER.
Come forth, thou bringer once of bitter pangs,
[Draws an arrow from his belt.
My precious jewel now, - my chiefest treasure,--
A mark I'11 set thee, which the cry of grief
Could never penetrate, - but thou shalt pierce it;
And thou, my trusty bow-string, that so oft
Has served me faithfully in sportive scenes,
Desert me not in this most serious hour
Only be true this once, my own good cord,
That hast so often winged the biting shaft;For shouldst thou fly successless from my hand,
I have no second to send after thee.
34. WILLIAM TELL DESCRIBES IllS ESCAPE. -Schiller.
I LAY on deck, fast bound with cords, disarmed,
In utter hopelessness. I did not think
Again to see the gladsome light of day,
Nor the dear faces of my wife and children,
And eyed disconsolate the waste of waters.
Then we put forth upon the lake,- the Viceroy,
Rudolph der Harras, and their suite.  My bow
And quiver lay astern beside the helm;
And just as we had reached the corner, near
The Little Axen, Heaven ordained it so,
That from the Gotthardt's gorge a hurricane
Swept down upon us with such headlong force,
That every rower's heart within him sanlk,
And all on board looked for a watery grave.
Then heard I one of the attendant train,
Turning to Gessler, in this strain accost him:
"You see our danger, and your own, my lord,
And that we hover on the verge of death.
The boatmen there are powerless from fear,
Nor are they confident what course to take;Now, here is William Tell, a fearless man,
And knows to steer with more than common skill,
How if we should avail ourselves of him,
In this emergency?"  The Viceroy then
Addressed me thus: "If thou wilt undertake
To bring us through this tempest safely, Tell,
I might consent to free thee from thy bonds."
I answered, "' Yes, my lord, with God's assistancee
I'11 see what can be done, and help us Heaven!"
01n this they loosed me from my bonds, and I
Stood by the helm and fairly steered along;
Yet ever eyed my shooting gear askance,
4nd kept a watchful eye upon the shore,

To find some point where I might leap to land:
And when I had descried a shelving crag,
That jutted, smooth atop, into the lake, -
I bade the men put forth their utmost might,
Until we came before the shelving crag.
For there, I said, the danger will be past!
Stoutly they pulled, and soon we neared the point;
One prayer to God for His assisting grace,
And, straining every muscle, I brought round
The vessel's stern close to the rocky wall;
Then, snatching up my weapons, with a bound
I swung myself upon the flattened shelf,
And with my feet thrust off, with all my might,
The puny bark into the hell of waters.
There let it drift about, as Heaven ordains!
Thus am I here, delivered from the might
Of the dread storm, and man, more dreadful still.

Is it possible?
Is't so? I can no longer what I would?
No longer draw back at my liking? I
Must do the deed because I thought of it,
And fed this heart here with a dream? Because
I did not scowl temptation from my presence,
Dallied with thoughts of possible fulfilment,
Commenced no movement, left all time uncertain,
And only kept the road, the access, open?
I but amused myself with thinking of it.
The free-will tempted me, the power to do
Or not to do it. Was it criminal
To make the fancy minister to hope,
To fill the air with pretty toys of air,
And clutch fantastic sceptres moving toward me!
Was not the will kept free? Beheld I not
The road of duty close beside me,- but
One little step, and once more I was in it!
Where am I? Whither have I been transported?
No road, no track behind me; but a wall,
Impenetrable, insurmountable,
Rises obedient to the spells I muttered
And meant not, - my own doings tower behind me

Than lies upon that truth, we live to learn.
For fable is Love's world, his home, his birth-place;
Dehghtedly dwells he'mong fays and talismans,
And spirits; and delightedly believes

Jaf. Could my nature e'er
Have brooked injustice, or the doing wrongs,
I need not now thus low have bent myself
To gain a hearing from a cruel father.
Wronged you?
Pri, Yes, wronged me i In the nicest point
The honor of my house, you've done me wrong.
You may remember (for I now will speak,
And urge its baseness), when you first came home
From travel, with such hopes as made you looked on,
By all men's eyes, a youth of expectation,
Pleased with your growing virtue, I received you,
Courted, and sought to raise you to your merits:
My house, my table, nay, my fortune, too,
My very self, was yours;-- you might have used me
To your best service. Like an open friend,
I treated, trusted you, and thought you mine,
When, in requital of my best endeavors,
You treacherously practised to undo me:
Seduced the weakness of my age's darling,
My only child, and stole her from my bosom.
0, Belvidera!
Jaf.'T is to me you owe her:
Childless you had been else, and in the grave
Your name extinct, - no more Priuli heard of.
You may remember, scarce five years are past,
Since, in your brigantine, you sailed to see
The Adriatic wedded by our Duke;
And I was with you. Your unskilful pilot
Dashed us upon a rock, when to your boat
You made for safety: entered first yourself:
The affrighted Belvidera following next,
As she stood trembling on the vessel's side,
Was, by a wave, washed off into the deep;
When instantly I plunged into the sea,
And, buffeting the billows to her rescue,
Redeemed her life with half the loss of mine.
Like a rich conquest, in one hand I bore her,
And with the other dashed the saucy waves,
That thronged and pressed to rob me of my priz;
I brought her, - gave her to your despairing arms:
Indeed you thanked me; but a nobler gratitude
Rose in her soul; for from that hour she loved me.
Till for her life she paid me with herself.
Prt. You stole her from me! - like a thief you stole her,
At dead of night! that cursed hour you chose
To rifle me of all my heart held dear
it3THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
May all your joys in her prove false, like mine!
A sterile fortune, and a barren bed,
Attend you both! continual discord make
Your days and nights bitter and grievous! still
May the hard hand of a vexatious need
Oppress and grind you; till, at last, you find
The curse of disobedience all your portion!
Jaf. Half of your curse you have bestowed in vain;
Heaven has already crowned our outcast lot
With a young boy, sweet as his mother's beauty.
May he live to prove more gentle than his grandsire,
And happier than his father!
Pri. Rather live
To bait thee for his bread, and din your ears
With hungry cries; whilst his unhappy mother
Sits down and weeps in bitterness of want!
Jaf. You talk as if't would please you.
Pri.'T would, by Heaven!
Jaf. Would I were in my grave!
Pri. And she, too, with thee!
For, living here, you're but my cursed remembrancers
I was once happy!
Jaf. You use me thus, because you know my soul
Is fond of Belvidera. You perceive
My life feeds on her, therefore thus you treat me.
Were I that thief, the doer of such wrongs
As you upbraid me with, what hinders me
But I might send her back to you with contumely,
And court my fortune where she would be kinder?
Pri. You dare not do't!
Jaf. Indeed, my Lord, I dare not.
My heart, that awes me, is too much my mastei.
Three years are past, since first our vows were plighted,
During which time, the world must bear me witness,
I've treated Belvidera as your daughter, -
The daughter of a Senator of Venice; -
Distinction, place, attendance, and observance,
Due to her birth, she always has commanded.
Out of my little fortune I've done this;
Because (though hopeless e'er to win your nature}
The world might see I loved her for herself,
Not as the heiress of the great Priuli.

39. NOTHING IN IT.--Charles AMathews.
Leech. But you don't laugh, Coldstream! Come, man, be amused,
for once in your life! - you don't laugh.
Sir Charles. 0, yes, I do. You mistake; I laughed twice, distinctly, - only, the fact is, I am bored to death!
Leech. Bored? What! after such a feast as that you have given
us? Look at me, -I'm inspired! I'm a King at this moment, and
all the world is at my feet!
Sir C. My dear Leech, you began life late. You are a young
fellow, - forty-five, - and have the world yet before you. I started
at thirteen, lived quick, and exhausted the whole round of pleasure
before I was thirty. I've tried everything, heard everything, done
everything, know everything; and here I am, a man of thirty-three,
literally used up - completely blase!
Leech. Nonsense, man! - used up, indeed! - with your wealth,
with your twenty estates in the sunniest spots in England,- not to
mention that Utopia, within four walls, in the Rue de Provence, in
Paris.
Sir C. I'm dead with ennui!
Leech. Ennui! poor Croesus!
Sir C. Croesus! - no, I'm no Croesus! My father, - you've seen
his portrait, good old fellow! - he certainly did leave me a little matter of twelve thousand pounds a year; but, after all--
Leech. O, come!--
Sir C. O, I don't complain of it.
Leech. I should think not.
Sir C. O, no; there are some people who can manage to do on
less,.-- on credit.
Leech. I know several. My dear Coldstream, you should try.hange of scene.
Sir C. I have tried it; - what's the use?
Leech. But I'd gallop all over Europe.
Sir C. I have; - there's nothing in it.

15. MOSES IN SIGHT OF THE PROMISED LAND.-W. B. O. Peabody. B. 1799; d. 1847.
THE legislation of Moses! Let me ask, what other legislation of
ancient times is still exerting any influence upon the world? What
philosopher, what statesman of ancient times, can boast a single disciple now?.W'hat other voice comes down to us, over the stormy
waves of time? But this man is at this day, - at this hour, - exerting a mighty influence over millions; the whole Hebrew Nation do
homage to his illustrious name. Though the daily sacrifice has ceased,
and the distinction of the tribes is lost, -  though the temple has not
left one stone upon another, and the altar-fires have been extinguished
long ago, - still, wherever a Jew is found, - and they are found
wherever the foot of an adventurer travels, - he is a living monument
of the power which this great Hebrew statesman still has over the
minds and hearts of his countrymen.
And now let us take one glance at this prophet, at the close of a
life so laborious and honored.  Up to his one hundred and twentieth
year, his eye was not dim, nor had his strength abated.  But now,
when he stands almost on the edge of the promised land, his last hour
of mortal life is come. To conduct his People to that land had been
his daily effort, and his nightly dream; and yet he is not permitted
to enter it, though it would never have been the home of Israel, but
for him. He ascends a mountain to die, and there the land of promise
spreads out its romantic landscape at his feet. There is Gilead, with its
deep valleys and forest-covered hills; there are the rich plains and
pastures of Dan; there is Judah with its rocky heights, and Jericho
with its palm-trees and rose-gardens; there is the Sordan, seen from
Lebanon downward, wirnding over its yellow sands; the long blue line
of the Mediterranean can be seen over the mountain battleIments of
the West.   On this magnificent death-bed the Statesman of Israel
breathed his last. Lest the gratitude which so often follows the dead,
though denied to the living, should pay him Divine honors, they buried
him in darkness and silence; and no man knoweth of his sepalehrc,
unto this day.

Leech. Yoa should go to Switzerland.
Sir C. I have been. - Nothing there, - people say so much about
everything. There certainly were a few glaciers, some monks, and
large dogs, and thick ankles, and bad wine, and Mont Blanc; yes, and
there was ice on the top, too; but I prefer the ice at Gunter's, -- less
trouble, and more in it.
Leech. Then, if Switzerland would n't do, I'd try Italy.
Sir C. My dear Leech, I've tried it over and over again,-- an
what then?
Leech. Did not Rome inspire you?
Sir C. O, believe me, Tom, a most horrible hole! People talk so
much about these things. There's the Coloseum, now; - round, very
round, - a goodish ruin enough; but I was disappointed with it. Capitol,- tolerable high; and St. Peter's,-- marble, and mosaics, and foun.
tains,- dome certainly not badly scooped; but there was nothing
in it.
Leech. Come, Coldstream, you must admit we have nothing like
St. Peter's in London.
Sir C. No, because we don't want it; but, if we wanted such a
thing, of course we should have it. A dozen gentlemen meet, pass
resolutions, institute, and in twelve months it would be run up; nay,
if that were all, we'd buy St. Peter's itself, and have it sent over.
Leech. Ha, ha! well said, - you're quite right. What say you to
beautiful Naples?
Sir C. Not bad, -excellent water-melons, and goodish opera;
they took me up Vesuvius, --a horrid bore! It smoked a good deal,
certainly, but altogether a wretched mountain;-saw the craterlooked down, but there was nothing in it.

Leech. She can, by you. Take the first woman that comes: on nly

Jenkinson. A wonderful man! A wonderful man!
Moses. Ah, a patient of that impudent quack doctor.
Jen. Quack doctor, Sir?  Would there were more such!     One
draught of his aqua soliginus has cured inme of a sweating sickness, that
was on me now these six years; and carried a large imposthume off
my throat, that scarce let me eat, drink or sleep, except in an upright
posture, and now it has gone as clean, saving your presence, as -

at full length, in a cart; but I shall ride back as upright as a gate-post,

I have a horse to sell, Sir..Jen. O! I warrant me you are one of those cozening horse-jockeys
that take in poor honest folk.' I know no more of horses than you do
of Greek.
Moses. Nay -   [aside] - but I must appear simple. - I assure you,
Sir, that you need not fear being cozened by me. I have a good
stout colt for sale, that has been worked in the plough these two years;
you can but step aside and look at him.
Jen. Well, as for that, I don't care if I do; but, bless me! I was
forgetting my wares.                             [Takes up his box.

Jen. [mysteriously]. Ah! that's a secret.. They're my wares.
There's a good twelve pounds' worth under the lid of that box. But

true, she tumbled off once; but that was her fault, and not the
colt's.
Jen. Then, I,don't care if I say a bargain.  How much is it to be?
I don't like paying more than ten guineas.
Moses [aside]. He's not worth half the money! You shall name
your own price; [aside]- and then nobody can say I cheated him.
Jen. What say you to nine guineas, and the odd half-guinea ftir
saddle and bridle?
Moses. Nay, I would not drive a hard bargain, - I'm content.
Jen. Stop a bit, and I'11 give the money. [Pretends to search his
pockets.] Eh? - 0,, nay,'t is t' other pocket; no, O! I'm a ruined

Jen. [prevents him]. Nay, good young man, I have friends enow
in this place who will do that for me. It is the loss of the horse that
vexes me. Hold! - perhaps, though I can no longer buy, you may
be willing to make a barter?
Moses. Why, the practice of barter was much used among the
ancients; and, indeed, the Lacedemonians had no coined money until
after the time of Lycurgus, as you are aware.
Jen. No- I can't say I know the family. But will you exchange
your horse against my wares? There's a good twelve pounds' worth
of'em.
Moses. What are they? Deprome - that is, bring them forth.

41, VAN DEN BOSCH AND VAN ARTEVELDE.-Henry Taylor.
Artevelde. This is a mighty matter, Van den Bosch,
And. much to be revolved ere it be answered.
Van den Bosch. The people shall elect thee with one voimeRHEETORICAL AND DRAMATIC.-- IAYL%YB,.
I will insure the White-Hoods, and the rest
Will eagerly accept thy nomination,
So to be rid of some that they like less,
Thy name is honored both of rich and poor;
For all are mindful of the glorious rule
Thy father bore, when Flanders, prosperous then,
From end to end obeyed him as one town.
Art. They may remember it; and, Van den Bosch,
May I not, too, bethink me of the end
To which this People brought my noble fhther 2
They gorged the fruits of his good husbandry
Till, drunk with long prosperity, and blind
With too inuch fatness, they tore up the root
From which their common weal had sprung and flourished.
Van den B. Nay, Master Philip, let the past be past.
Art. Here, on the doorstead of my father's house,
The blood of his they spilt is seen no more.
But when I was a child I saw it there;
For so long as my widow-mother lived
Water came never near the sanguine stain.
She loved to show it me; and then, with awe,
But hoarding still the purpose of revenge,
I heard the tale; which, like a daily prayer
Repeated, to a rooted feeling grew, -
How long he fought; how falsely came like friends
Thd villains Guisebert Grutt and Simon Bette;
All the base murder of the one by many!
Even such a brutal multitude as t-hey
Who slew my father; yea, who slew their own
(For like one had he ruled the parricides),
Even such a multitude thou'dst have me govern.
Van den B. Why, what if Jacques Artevelde was killed
He had his reign, and that for many a year,
And a great glory did he gain thereby.
And as for Guisebert Grutt and Simon Bette,
Their breath is in their nostrils as was his.
If you be as stout-hearted as your father,
And mindful of the villanous trick they played him,
Their hour of reckoning is well-nigh come.
Of that, and of this base, false-hearted league
They're making with the earl, these two to us
Shall give account.
Art. They cannot render back
The golden bowl that's broken at the fountain,
Or mend the wheel that's broken at the cistern
Or twist again the yilver cord that's loosed..
Yea, life for life, vile bankrupts as they are, -
0212THE STANDARD SPEA&amp;ER,
Their worthless lives, for his of countless price,is their whole wherewithal to pay their debt.
Yet, retribution is a goodly thing,
And it were well to wring the payment from them
Even to the utmost drop of their heart's blood!
Van den B. Then will I call the People to the square
And speak for your election.
Art. Not so fast.
Your vessel, Van den Bosch, hath felt the storm,
She rolls dismasted in an ugly swell,
And you would make a jury-mast of me,
WVhereon to spread the tatters of your canvab.
And what am I? Why, I am as the oak
WYhich stood apart, far down the vale of life,
Growing retired, beneath a quiet sky.
Wherefore should this be added to the wreck?
Van den B. I pray you, speak it in the Burgher's tongue
I lack the scholarship to talk in tropes.
Art. The question, to be plain, is briefly this: -
Shall I, who, chary of tranquillity,
Not busy in this factious city's broils,
Nor frequent in the market-place, eschewed
The even battle, - shall I join the rout?
Van den B. Times are sore changed, I see; there's none in G nera
That answers to the name of Artevelde.
Thy father did not carp nor question thus,
When Ghent invoked his aid. The days have been
When not a citizen drew breath in Ghent
But freely would have died in Freedom's cause.
Art. The cause, I grant thee, Van den Bosch, is good;
And, were I linked to earth no otherwise
But that my whole heart centred in myself,
I could have tossed ybu this poor life to play with,
Taking no second thought. But as things are,
I will revolve the matter warily,
And send thee word betimes of my conclusion.
Van den B. Betimnes it must be, for the White-Hood cLiefs
Meet two hours hence; and ere we separate
Oilr course must be determined.
Art. In two hours,
If I be for you, I will send this ring
In token I have so resolved. Farewell I
Van den B. Philip Van Artevelde, a greater man
than ever Ghent beheld, we'11 make of thee,
If thou be bold enough to try this venture.
God give thee heart o do so! Fare thee well

That't is ignoble to have led my life

are going to become the greatest musician in the world, and straight
you fill my house with fiddlers.
Tristram Fickle. I am clear out of that scrape now, Sir.
Old F. Then, from a fiddler, you are metamorphosed into a philosopher; and, for the noise of drums, trumpets and hautboys, you substitute a vile jargon, more unintelligible than was ever heard at the
tower of Babel.
Tri. You are right, Sir. I have found out that philosophy is folly;
so I have cut the philosophers of all sects, from Plato and Aristotle
down to the puzzlers of modern date.
Old F. How much had I to pay the cooper, the other day, for barrelling you up in a large tub, when you resolved to live like Diogenes?
Tri. You should not have paid him anything, Sir; for the tub
would not hold. You see the contents are run out.
Old F. No jesting, Sirr! this is no laughing matter. Your follies

lawyer.
Old F. Twelve square feet of learning! Well--
Tri. I have likewise sent for a barberOld F. A barber! What, is he to teach you to shave close?
Tri. lIe is to shave one-half of my head, Sir.
Old F. You will excuse' me if I cannot perfectly understand what
that has to do with the study of the law.
Tri. Did you never hear of Demosthenes, Sir, the Athenian orator?  He had half his head shaved, and locked himself up in a coalcellar.
Old F. Ah, he was perfectly right to lock himself up, after having
undergone such an operation as that. He certainly would have made
rather an odd figure abroad.
Tri. I think I see, him now, awaking the dormant patriotism of his
countrymen, - lightning in his eye, and thunder in his voice; he
pours forth a torrent of eloquence, resistless in its force; the throne
of Philip trembles while he speaks; he denounces, and indignation
fills the bosom of his hearers; he exposes the impending danger, and
every one sees impending ruin; he threatens the tyrant, - they grasp
their swords; he calls for vengeance, - their thirsty weapons glitter in
the air, and thousands reverberate the cry! One soul animates a

For confidence, suspicion; and the glow

And vengeance it shall have! What, ho! who waits there?

is in the bosom of the earth concealed; and if there be occasion at
any time to search into it, such labor is then more necessary thanJ
pleasant, both to them which undertake it and for the lookers on.
In like manner, the use and benefit of good laws, all that live under
them may enjoy wmith delight and comfort, albeit the grounds and first
driginal causes from whence they have sprung be unknown, as to the
greatest part of men they are.
Since the time that God did first proclaim the edicts of His law
upon the world, Heaven and earth have hearkened unto His voice, and
their labor hath been to do His will. He made a law for the rain;
He gave His decree unto the sea, that the waters should'not pass His
commandmlent. Now, if Nature should intermit her course, and leave
altogether, though it were for a while, the observat?on of her own
law; if those principal and mother elements of the world, whereof
all things in this lower world are made, should lose the qualities
which now they have; if the frame of that Heavenly arch erected
over our heads should loosen and dissolve itself; if celestial spheres
should forget their wonted motions, and by irregular volubility turn
themselves any way as it might happen; if the prince of the lights
of Heaven, which now, as a giant, doth run his unwearied course,
should, as it were, through a languishing faintness, begin to stand
and to rest himself; if the moon should wander from her beaten way;
the times and seasons of the year blend themselves by disordered
and confused miiture; the winds breathe out their last gasp; the
clouds yield no rain; the earth be defeated of Heavenly influence; the
fruits of the earth pine away, as children at the withered breasts of
their mother, no longer able to yield them relief, --what would become of man himself, whom these things do now all serve? See we
not plainly that obedience of creatures unto the law of nature is the
stay of the whole world?
Of Law there can be no less acknowledged than that her seat is
the bosom of God; her voice the harmony of the world; all things in
Heaven and earth do her homage; the very least as feeling her care,
and the greatest as not exempted from her power. Both angels and
men, and creatures of what condition soever, though each in different
sort and manner, yet all, with uniform consent, admiring her as the
mother of their peace and joy.

IN this God's world, with its wild-whirling eddies and mad foamoceans, where men and Nations perish as if without law, and judgment
for an unjust thing is sternly delay-d, dost thou think that there is
therefore no justice? It is what the fool hath said in his heart. It

Mal. Ad Now. Saladin,
The word is given, I have nothing more
To fear from thee, my brother. I am not
About to crave a miserable life.
Without thy love, thy honor, thy esteem,
Life were a burden to me. Think not, either,
The justice of thy sentence I would question.
But one request now trembles on my tongue, -
One wish still clinging round the heart, which soon
Not even that shall torture,  will it, then,
Thinkest thou, thy slumbers render quieter,
Thy wakcing thoughts more pleasing, to reflect,
That when thy voice had doomed a brother'" death,
The last request which e'er was his to utte,
Thy harshness made him carry to the gra,e?
Sal. Speak, then; but ask thyself if thou hast reason
To look for much indulgence here.
Mal. Ad. I have not!
Yet will I ask for it. We part forever;
This is our last farewell; the king is satisfied;
The judge has spoke the irrevocable sentence.
None sees, none hears, save that omniscient power,
Which, trust me, will not frown to look upon
Two brothers part like such. When, in the face
Of forces once my own, I'm led to death,
Then be thine eye unmoistened; let thy voice
Then speak my doom untrembling; then,
Unmoved, behold this stiff and blackened corse.
But now I ask - nay, turn not, Saladin! -
I ask one single pressure of thy hand;
From that stern eye one solitary tear -
O, torturing recollection - one kind word
From the loved tongue which once breathed naught but kindne,s
Still silent? Brother! friend! beloved companion
Of all my youthful sports! - are they forgotten?
Strike me with deafness, make me blind, 0 Heaven!
Let me not see this unforgiving man
Smile at my agonies! nor hear that voice
Pronounce my doom, which would not say one word
One little word, whose cherished memory
Would soothe the struggles of departing life!
Yet, yet thou wilt! 0, turn thee, Saladin!
Look on my face, - thou canst not spurn me then,
Look on the once-loved face of Malek Adhel

*a BPEECH OF SERGEANT BUZFUZ IN TUE CASE OF BARDELL AG.AIN
PICKWICK. - Charles Dickens.
You heard from my learned friend, Gentlemen of the Jury, that
this is an action for a breach of promise of marriage, in which the
damages are laid at fifteen hundred pounds. The plaintiff, Gentlemen,
is a widow; yes, Gentlemen, a widow. The late Mr. Bardell, some time
before his death, became the father, Gentlemen, of a little boy. With
this little boy, the only pledge of her departed exciseman, Mrs. Bardell shrunk from the world, and courted the retirement and tranquillity of Goswell-street; and here she placed in her front parlor-window
a written placard, bearing this inscription, -" Apartments furnished
for a single gentleman. Inquire within."  Mrs. ~Bardell's opinions
of the opposite sex, Gentlemen, were derived from a long contemplation of the inestimable qualities of her lost husband. She had no
fear, - she had no distrust, - all was confidence and reliance.  " Mr.
Bardell," said the widow, "G was a man of honor, - Mr. Bardell was a
man of his word, - Mr. Bardell was no deceiver, - Mr. Bardell was
once a single gentleman himself; to single gentlemen I look for
protection, for assistance, for comfort, and consolation; --in single
gentlemen I shall perpetually see something to remind me of what
Mr. Bardell was, when he first won my young and untried affections;
to a single gentleman, then, shall my lodgings be let."  Actuated by
this beautiful -and touching impulse (among the best impulses of our
imperfect nature, Gentleinen), the lonely and desolate widow dried her
tears, furnished her first floor, caughlt her innoaent boy to her maternal
bosom, and put the bill up in her parlor-window.  Did it remain
there long? No. "The serpent was on the watch, the train was laid,
the mine was preparing, the sapper and miner was at work! Before
the bill had been in the parlor-window three days,-- three days,
Gentlemen, - a being, erect upon two legs, and bearing all the out..
ward semblance of a man, and not of a monster, knocked at the door
of Mrs. Bardell's house! He inquired within; he took the lodgings
and on the very next day he entered into possession of them. This
man was Pickwick, - Pickwick, the defendant!
Of this man I will say little.  The subject presents but few attractions; and I, Gentlemen, am not the man, nor are you, Gentlemen,532
THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
the men, to delighlt in the contemplation of revolting heartlessness,
and of systematic villany.  I say systematic villany, Gentlemen; and
when I say systematic villany, let me tell the defendant, Pickwick, if
nci be in Court, as I am informed he is, that it would have been more
decent in him, more becoming, if he had stopped away.  Let me tell
him, further, that a counsel, in his discharge of his duty, is neither to
be intimidated, nor bullied, nor put down; and that any attempt to do
either the one or the other will recoil on the head of the attempter, be
he plaintiff or be he defendant, be his name Pickwick, or Noakes, or
Stoakes, or Stiles, or Brown, or Thompson.
I shall show you, Gentlemen, that for two years Picklwick continued
to reside constantly, and without interruption or intermission, at Mrs.
Bardell's house.  I shall show you that Mrs. Bardell, during the
rwhole of that time, waited on him, attended to his comforts, cooked
his meals, looked out his linen for the washerwoman when it went
lbroad, darned, aired, and prepared it for wear when it came home,
and, in short, enjoyed his ftillest trust and confidence.  I shall show
you that, on many occasions, he gave half-pence, and on some occasions
even sixpence, to her little boy. I shall prove to you, that on one
occasion, when he returned from the country, he distinctly and in
terms offered her marriage: previously, however, taking special care
that there should be no witnesses to their solemn contract; and I am
in a situation to prove to you, on the testimony of three of his own
friends, - most unwilling witnesses, Gentlemen, - most unwilling witnesses, - that on that morning he was discovered by them holding the
plaintiff in his arms, and soothing her agitation by his caresses and
endearments.
And now, Gentlemen, but one word more. Two letters have
passed between these parties, - letters that must be viewed with a
cautious and suspicious eye, - letters that were evidently intended, at
the tim'e, by Pickwick, to mislead and delude any third parties into
whose hands they might fall. Let me read the first: -- " Garraway's,
twelve o'clock. - Dear Mrs. B. - Chops and Tomato sauce. Yours,
Pickwick."  G-entlemen, what does this mean?  Chops and Tomato
sauce! Yours, Pickwick! Chops! Gracious Heavens! And Tomato
sauce! Gentlemen, is the happiness of a sensitive and confiding
female to be trifled away by such shallow artifices as these? The
next has no date whatever, which is in itself suspicious. - "Dear Mrs.
B., I shall not be at home to-morrow. Slow coach." And then follows
this very remarkable expression, -" Don't trouble yourself about thg
warming-pan."   The warming-pan!   Why, Gentlemen, who does
trouble himself about a warming-pan?  Why is Mrs. Bardell so
earnestly entreated not to agitate herself about this warming-pan,
unless (as is no doubt the case) it is a mere cover for hidden fire -a
mere substitute for some endearing word or promise, agreeably to a
preconcertecl system of correspondence, artfully contrived by Pickwick
with a view to his contempla4 d desertion? And what does this allu.
sion to the slow coach mean' For aught I know, it may be a referenceCOMIC AND SATIRICAL. -- IOOD.
to Pickwick himself, who has most unquestionably been a criminally
slow coach during the whole of this transaction, but whose speed will
tow be very unexpectedly accelerated, and whose wheels, Gentlemen,
as he will find to his cost, will very soon be greased by you!
But enough of this, Gentlemen.  It is difficult to smile witlh an
aching heart. Miy client's hopes and prospects are ruined, and it is
no figure of speeclh to say that her occupation is gone indeed. The
bill is down - but there is no tenant! Eligible single gentlemen pas
and repass - but there is no invitation for them to inquire within, or
without! All is gloom and silence in the house; even the voice of
the child is hushed; his infant sports are disregarded, when his mother
weeps. But Pickwick, Gentlemen, Pickwick, the ruthless destroyer of
this domestic oasis in the desert of Goswell-street, - Pickwick, who has
choked up the well, and thrown ashes on the sward, - Pickwick, who
comes before you to-day with his heartless tomato-sauce and warmingpans, - Pickwick still rears his head with unblushing effrontery, and
gazes without a sigh on the ruin he has made! Damages, Gentlemen,
heavy damages, is the only punishment with which you can visit
him, -the only recompense you can award to my client! And for
those damages she now appeals to an enlightened, a high-minded, a
right-feeling, a conscientious, a dispassionate, a sympathizing, a contemplative Jury of her civilized countrymen!
2. THE ART OF BOOK-KEEPING. - Thomas Hood. Born, 1798; died, 1845.
How hard, when those who do not wish to lend, thus lose, their books,
Are snared by anglers, - folks that fish with literary Hooks, -
Who call and take some favorite tome, but never read it through;--
They thus complete their set at home, by making one at you.
I, of my'" Spenser " quite bereft, last winter sore was shaken;
Of " Lamb." I're but a quarter left, nor could I save my' Bacon;"
And then I saw my " Crabbe," at last, like Hamlet, backward go;
And, as the tide was ebbing fast, of course I lost my " Rowe."
My "Mallet" served to knock me down, which makes me thus a
talker;
And once, when I was out of town, my "Johnson" proved a " Walker."
While studying, o'er the fire, one day, my " Hobbes," amidst the smoke,
They bore my 1" Colman " clean away, and carried off my " Coke."
They picked my " Locke," to me far more than Bramah's patent worth,
And now my losses I deplore, without a "Home" on earth.
If once a book you let them lift, another they conceal,
For though I caught them stealing "SviRft," as swiftly went my
"Steele  
6 Iope" is not now upon my shelf, where late he stood elated;
But what is strange, my " Pope " himself is excommunicated.
Hy little " Suckling" in the grave is sunk to swell the ravage;
&amp;nd what was Crtusoe's fate to save,'t was mine to lose, --a " Savage."
533THE STANDARD E EAKER.
Evern " Glover's " works I cannot put my frozen hanlds upon;
Though ever since I lost my " Foote," my " Bunyan" has been gone.
My 1"lHoyle" with "Cotton" went oppressed; my 6"Taylor," too
must fail;
To save my " Goldsmith " from arrest; in vain I offered " Bayle."
I "P'rior " sought, but could not see the " Hood " so late in front;
And when I turned to hunt for "Lee," 0! where was my "Leigh
Hunt "?
I tried to laugh, old care to tickle, yet could not "Tickle'  touch;
And then, alack! I missed my " Mickle," - and surely Mickle's much.'T is quite enlough my griefs to feed, my sorrows to excuse,
To think I cannot read my " Reid," nor even use my " Hughes;"
MIy classics would not quiet lie, a thing so fondly hoped;
Like Dr. Primrose, I may cry, my " Livy" has eloped.
[M~y life is ebbing fast away; I suffer from these shocks,
And though I fixed a lock on " Gray," there's gray upon my locks;
I'm far from " Young," am growing pale, I see my " Butler" fly;
And when they ask about my ail,'t is " Burton " I reply.
They still have made me slight returns, and thus my griefs divide;
For 0! they cured me of my "Burns," and eased my " Akenside."
pBut all I think I shall not say, nor let my anger burn,
For, as they never found me " Gay," they have not left me 1" Sterne.o'

"' DEAR Madam, I pray," quoth a Magpie, one day,
To a Monkey, who happened to come in her way, -
"h If you'11 but come with me
To my snug little home in the trunk of a tree,
I'11 show you such treasures of art and vertu,
Such articles, old, medieval, and new,
As a lady of taste and discernment like you
Will be equally pleased and astonished to view;---
In an oak-tree hard by I have stowed all these rarities;
And if you'11 colme with me, I'11 soon you show where it &amp;"'
The Monkey agreed at once to proceed,
And, hopping along at the top of her speed,
To keep up with the guide, who flew by her side,
As eager to show as the other to see,
Presently came to the old oak-tree;
When, from a hole in its mighty bole,
In which she had cunningly hidden the whole,
One by one the Magpie drew,
And displayed her hoard to the Monkey's view:
A buckle of brass, some bits of glass,
A ribbon dropped by a gypsy lass;COMIIC AND SATIRICAL. - YRIARiTE.
A tattered handkerchief edged with lace,
The haft of a knife, and a tooth-pick ease;
An inch or so of Cordelier's rope,
A very small cake of Castilian soap,.nd a medal blessed by the holy Pope;
Half a cigar, the neck of a jar,
A couple of pegs from a cracked guitar;
Beads, buttons and rings, and other odd things,
And such as my hearers would think me an ass, if I
Tried to enumerate fully or classify.
At last, having gone, one by one, through the whole,
And carefully packed them again in the hole,
Alarmed at the pause, and not without caws,
The 3Magpie looked anxiously down for applause.
The monkey, meanwhile, with a shrug and a smile,
Having silently eyed the contents of the pile,
And found them, in fact, one and all, very vile,
Resolved to depart; and was making a start,
When, observing the movement with rage and dismay,
the Magpie addressed her, and pressed her to stay:
"What, sister, I pray, have you nothing to say,
In return for the sight that I've shown you to-day?
Not a syllable? - hey? I'm surprised! - well I may, --
That so fine a collection, with nothing to pay,
Should be treated in such a contemptuous way.
I looked for applause, as a matter of right,
And certainly thought that you'd prove more polite."
At length, when the Magpie had ceased to revile,
The Monkey replied, with a cynical smile:
"Well, Ma'am, since my silence offends you," said she,
"I'11 frankly confess that such trifles possess,
Though much to your taste, no attraction for me;
For though, lilie yourself, a collector of pelf,
Such trash, ere I'd touch it, might rot on a shelf;
And I'd not, by Saint Jago, out of my way go
A moment to pick up so vile a farrago.
To the digging of roots, and the prigging of fruits,
I strictly confine my industrial pursuits;
And whenever I happen to find or to steal
Alore than will serve for a moderate meal,For my appetite's small, and I don't eat a deal, -
In the pouches or craws which hang from my jaws
And which I contract or distend at my pleasure,
I safely deposit the rest of my treasure,
And carry it home, to be eaten at leisure.
In sho-t, Ma'am, while you collect rubbish and rags, -
A mass of chiffonerie not worth possessing, -

I gather for use, and replenish my bags
With things that are really a comfort and blessing,--
A reserve, if I need them, for future subsistence,
Adapted to lengthen and sweeten existence."

Elicit some practical hint from the fableSuited the Magpie, and suits just as well any
Quarterly, monthly, or weekly miscellany,
WVhose contents exhibit so often a hash,
Oddly compounded, of all kinds of trash,
That I wonder, whenever I chance to inspect them,
How editors have the bad taste to select them.

Though you are worthless, witless, never mind it;
You may have been a stable-boy, - what then?'T is wealth, good Sir, makes honorable men.

On such a score; - why should it take the pains?'T is easier to weigh purses, sure, than brains.

And no one noticed him, and no one ever
Gave him a welcome. " Strange! " cried I; "whence is it

Now here, now there, in vain he tried;
Some formally and freezingly replied,

He could not pride himself upon his wit;
And as for wisdom, he had none of it;
IHe had what's better, - he had wealth,

The poor man hung his head;
And to himself he saidcl,
"This is, indeed, beyond my comprehension!"
Then looking round,
One friendly face he found,
And said, "Pray tell me, why is wealth preferred
To wisdom? " - "That's a silly question, friend "
Replied the other; "have you never heard,

Of gold or silver ore,
But wisdom none can borrow, none can lend? "

THE Yankee boy, before he's sent to school,
Well knows the mysteries of that magic tool,
The pocket-knife. To that his wistful eye
Turns, while he hears his mother's lullaby;
His hoarded cents he gladly gives to get it,
Then leaves no stone unturned till he can whet it;
And in the education of the lad
No little part that implement hath had.
His pocket-knife to the young whittler brings
A growing knowledge of material things.
Projectiles, music, and the sculptor's art,
HIis chestnut whistle and his shingle dart,
His elder pop-gun with its hickory rod,
Its sharp explosion and reboundinlg wad,
His corn-stalk fiddle, and the deeper tone
That murmurs from his pumpkin-stalk trombone,
Conspire to teach the boy. To these succeed
His bow, his arrow of a feathered reed,
His wind-mill, raised the passing breeze to win,
His water-wheel, that turns upon a pin;

6. CITY MEN IN THIE COUNTRY. -Oliver Wendell Holmes
CO,ME back to your mother, ye children, for shame,
Who have wandered like truants for riches or fame!
With a smile on her face and a sprig in her cap,
She calls you to feast from her bountiful lap.
Come out fronl your alleys, your courts, and your lanes,
And breathe, like young eagles, the air of our plains;
Take a whiff from our fields, and your excellent wives
Will declare it's all nonsense insuring your lives.
Come you of the law, who can talk, if you please,
Till the man in the moon will allow it's'a cheese,
And leave " the old lady that never tells lies "
To sleep with her handkerchief over her eyes.
Ye healers of men, for a moment decline
Your feats in the rhubarb and ipecac line;
WVhile you shut up your turnpike, your neighbors can gc
The old roundabout road to the regions below.
You clerk, on whose ears are a couple of pens,
And whose head is an ant-hill of units and tens,
Though Plato denies you, we welcome you still
As a featherless biped, in spite of your quill.
1'oor drudge of the city! how happy he feels
With the burrs on his legs and the grass at his heels;
No dodger behind, his bandannas to share, -
No constable grumbling, "You must n't walk there! "
to38COMIC AND SATIRICAL.
fn yonder green meadow, to Memory dear,
He slaps a mosquito and brushes a tear;
The dew-drops hang round him on blossoms and shoots, -
Ite breathes but one sigh for his youth and his boots.
There stands the old school-house, hard by the old chuich;
That tree at its side had the flavor of birch:
0, sweet were the days of his juvenile tricks,
Though the prairie of youth had so many " big licks 1"
By the side of yon river he weeps and he slumps,
The boots fill with water, as if they were pumps;
Till, sated with rapture, he steals to his bed,
With a glow in his heart and a cold in his head.'T is past, - he is dreaming, - I see him again;
The ledger returns as by legerdemain;
His neckeloth is damp with an easterly flaw,
And he holds in his fingers an omnibus straw.
Hle dreams the chill gust is a blossomy gale,
That the straw is a rose from his dcear native vale,
And murmurs, unconscious of space and of time,
" A. 1. - Extra super. - Ah, is n't it prime!"
O, what are the prizes we perish to win,
To the first little " shiner " we caught with a pin!
No soil upon earth is as dear to our eyes
As the soil we first stirred in terrestrial pies!
Then come from all parties, and parts, to our feast;
Though not at the "Astor," we'll give you, at least,
A bite at an apple, a seat on the grass,
And the best of old - water - at nothing a glass.
7, FUSS AT FIRES. -- nonymouts.
IT having been announced to me, my young friends, that you
vere about forming a file-company, I have called you together
o- give you such directions as long experience in a first-quality
ngine company qualifies me to communicate.   The moment you
iear an alarm  of fire, scream like a pair of panthers.  Run any
vay, except the right way, - for the furthest way round is the nearest
ray to the fire. If you happen to run on the top of a wood-pile, so
nuch the better, you can then get a good view of the neighborhood.
[f a light breaks on your view, " break" for it immediately; but be
ure you don't jump into a bow window. Keep yelling, all th3 time;
mnd, if you can't make night hideous enough yourself, kick all the
logs you come across, and set them yelling, too;'t will help amazingly.

auxiliary."  When you reach the scene of the fire, do all you can to
convert it into a scene of destruction. Tear down all the fences in
the vicinity.  If it be a chimney on fire, throw salt down it; or, if
you can't do that, perhaps the best plan would be to jerk off the
pump-handle and pound it down.  Don't forget to yell, all the while,
as it will have a prodigious effect in frightening off the fire. The
louder the better of course; and the more ladies in the vicinity, the
greater necessity for " doing it brown."  Should the roof begin to
smoke, get to work in good earnest, and make any man " smoke " that
interrupts you.  If it is summer, and there are fruit-trees,in the lot,
cu-t them down, to prevent the fire from roasting the apples. Don't
forget to yell!  Should the stable be threatened, carry out tle cowchains.  Never mind the horse, - he'11 be alive and kicking; and if
his legs don't do their duty, let them pay for the roast.  Ditto as to
the hogs; - let them  save their own bacon, or smoke for it. Wheln
the roof begins to burn, get a crow-bar and pry away the stone steps;
or, if the steps be of wood, procure an axe and chop them up. Next,
cut away the wasnh-boards in the basement story; and, if that don't
stop the flames, let the chair-boards on the first floor share a similar
fate.  Should the " devouring element " still pursue the " even tenor
of its way," you had better ascend to the second story.  Pitch out
the pitchers, and tumble out the tumblers.  Yell all the time!
If you find a baby abed, fling it into the second story window of
the house across the way; but let the kitten carefully down in a
work-basket.  Then draw out the bureau drawers, and empty their
contents out of the back window; telling somebody below to upset
the slop-barrel and rain-water hogshead at the same time. Of course,
you will attend to the mirror. The further it can be thrown, the
imore pieces will be made.  If anybody objects, sillash it over his
hLead. Do not, under any circumstances, drop the tongs down froim
the second story: the fall might break its legs, and render the poor
thing a cripple for life. Set it straddle of your shoulders, and carry
it dowxn carefully.  Pile the bed-clothes carefully on the floor, and
throw t!:~ clock,ery out of the window. By the time you will have
attended to all these things, the fire will certainly be arrested, or the
building be burnt down.  In either case, your services will be nl
keuger needed; and, of course, you require no further directions.
8. ONE STORY'S GOOD TILL ANOTHER IS I'OLD. - Charles Swain
THIERE'S a maxim that all should be willing to mind:'T is an old one, a kind one, and true as't is kind;'T is worthy of notice wherever you roanim,
And no worse for the heart, if remembered at home!
If scandal or censure be raised'gainst a friend;
Be the last to believe it - the first to defend  
Say, to-morrow will come - and then time will unfold
That " one story'i good till another is told! "
540COMIC AND SATIRICAL.
A friend's like a ship, when, with music and song,
The tide of good fortune still speeds him along;
But see him when tempest hath left him a wreck,
And any mean billow can batter his deck!
Then give me the heart that true sympathy shows,
And clings to a messmate, whatever wind blows;
And says, -when aspersion, unanswered, grows cold, -
Wait; --" one story's good till another is told! "
9. THE GREAT MIUSICAL CRITIC. - Original translatzon.
ONCE on a time, the Nightingale, whose singing
Had with her praises set the forest ringing,
Consented at a concert to appear.
Of course, her friends all flocked to hear,
And with them many a critic, wide awake
To pick a flaw, or carp at a mistake!'
She sang as only nightingales can sing;
And when she'd ended,
There was a general cry of " Bravo! splendid 1'
While she, poor thing,
Abashed and fluttering, to her nest retreated,
Quite terrified to be so warmly greeted.
The Turkeys gobbled their delight; the Geese,
Who had been known to hiss at many a trial,
Gave this one no denial:
It seemed as if the applause would never cease.
nBut,'mong the critics on the ground,
An Ass was present, pompous and profound,
Who said, "IMy friends, I'11 not dispute the honor,
That you would do our little primna donna.
Although her upper notes are very shrill,
And she defies all method in her trill,
She has some talent, and, upon the whole,
With study, may some cleverness attain.
Then, her friends tell me, she's a virtuous soul:
But -but-"
"But,i" growled the Lion, "by my mane,
I never knew an Ass who did not strain
To qualify a good thing with a but! "
"Nay," said the Goose, approaching, with a strut,
"Don't interrupt him, sire; pray let it pass;
-The Ass is honest, if he is an Ass!"'1 was about," said Long Ear, " to remark,
That there is something lacking in her whistle;  
Something magnetic, -

And kindle in the breast a spark
Like -  like, for instance, a good juicy thistle."
The assembly tittered, but the Fox, with gravity,
Said, at the Lion winking,
" Our learned friend, with his accustomed suavity,
JHas given his opinion, without shrinkinig
But, to do justice to the Nightingale,
He should inform us, as no doubt he will,
What sort of music't is that does not fail
His sensibilities to rouse and thrill."
"Why," said the critic, with a look potential,
And pricking up his ears, delighted much
At Reynard's tone and manner deferential,"Why, Sir, there's nothing can so deeply touch
JUiy feelings, and so carry me away,
As a fine, mellow, ear-inspiring bray."
"I thought so," said the Fox, without a pause;
" As far as you're concerned, your judgment's true, -
You do not like the Nightingale, because
The Nightingale is not an Ass like you!"
10. DRAMATIC STYLES. - Blackwood's eag'.
IN dramatic writing, the difference between the Grecian and Rooman
styles is very great.  When you deal with a Greek subject, you must
be very devout, and have unbounded reverence for Diana of the Ephesians.  You must also believe in the second sight, and be as solemn,
calim, and passionless, as the ghost of Hamlet's father. Never descend
to the slightest familiarity, nor lay off the stilts for a moment; and, far
from calling a spade a spade, call it
That sharp instrument
With which the Theban husbandman lays bare
The breast of our great mother.
The,oman, on the other hand, may occasionally be jocular, but
always warlike.  One is like a miracle-play in church;-- the other,
a tableau vivant in a camp.  If a Greek has occasion to ask his sweetP
heart'" if her mother knows she's out," and " if she has sold her mangle
yet," he says:
Mlenestheus. Cleanthe!
Cleanithe. My Lord!
M/Ien. Your mother, - your kind, excellent mother, -
She who hung o'er your couch in inf-ncy,
And felt within her heart the joyous pride
Of having such a daughter, - does sheo know,

Of the maternal walls.

11 THE GOUTY MERCI-IANT AND TI-IE STRANGER. - -orace Smitl
IN Broad-street buildings (on a winter night),
Snug by his parlor fire, a gouty wight
Sat, all alone, with one hand rubbing
His feet, rolled up in fleecy hose;
With t' other he'd beneath his nose
The Public Ledger, in whose columns grubbing,
He noted all the sales of hops,
Ships, shops, and slops,
Gums, galls, and groceries, ginger, gin,
Tar, tallow, tumeric, turpentine, and tin;
When, lo! a decent personage in black
Entered, and most politely said,"Your footman, Sir, has gone his nightlv track
To the King's Head,
And left your door ajar, which I
Observed in passing by;
And thought it neighborly to give you notice."
"Ten thousand thanks!" the gouty man replied'

"Indeed!!" replied the stranger, looking grave
"Then he's a clouble knave:

Nightly beset unguarded doors;
And see, how easily might one
Of these domestic foes,
Even beneath your very nose,
Perform his knavish tricks:
Enter your room, as I have done;
Blow out your candles, - thus, and thus,
Pocket your silver candlesticks,
And walk off, - thus! "
So said, so done; - he made no more remark,
Nor waited for replies,
But marched off with his prize,
Leaving the gouty merchant in the dark!
12 THE VICTIMI OF REFORMI. -Blaclcwood's Magazine. Adapted.
A MONKEY, once, whom fate had led to list
To all the rancorous spouting and contention
Of a convention
For every one's emancipation
From every thing, and body in creation,
Determined in the good work to assist.
So, with some curious notions in his noddle,
And conning portions of the precious twaddle
W\Thich, in the form of resolutions,
Had struck at all existing institutions,
Ile strode forthl with a step that seemed designed
To represent the mighty march of mind.
Not far he'd wandered, when his indignation
Was roused to see
A great menagerie,
Where birds and beasts of every race and station
All free-born animals, were kept confined,
Caged and locked up in durance vile!
It was a sight to waken all his bile.
The window of the building stood ajar;
It was not far,
Nor, like Parnassus, very hard to climb
The hour was verging on the supper timaCOMIC AND SATIRICAL.
And many a growl was sent through many a bar
Meanwhile, Pug scrambled upward, like a tar,
And soon crept in,
Unnoticed in the hunger-telling din.
Full of his new emancipating zeal,
Zounds! how it made him chafe, -
To look around upon this brute Bastille,
And see the King of creatures in -- a safe  
The desert's denizen in one small den,
Enduring all oppression's bitterest ills
A bear in bars unbearable; and then,
The fretful porcupine, with all its quills,
Imprisoned in a pen!
A tiger limited to four feet ten;
And, stilt worse lot, a leopard to one spot!
Pug went above, a solitary mounter,Up gloomy stairs, and saw a pensive group
Of hapless fowls, cranes, vultures, owls, -
In fact, it was a sort of poultry-counter,
Where feathered prisoners were doomed to droop:
HIere sat an eagle, forced to make a stoop,
Not from the skies, but his impending roof;
And there; aloof,
A pining ostrich, moping in a coop;
Writh other samples of the bird creation
All caged against their wills,
And cramped in such a space, the longest bills
Were plainly bills of least accommodation; -
In truth, it was a scene more foul than fair.
His temper little'mended,
Pug from his bird-cage walk at last descended
Unto the lion and the elephant,
His bosom in a pant
To see all Nature's free list thus suspended,
And beasts deprived of what she had intended.
Trhey could not even prey in their own way,A hardship always reckoned quite prodigious.
Thlus he revolved, and finally resolved
To give them freedom, civil and religious;
And first, with stealthy paw, Pug hastened to withdraw
The bolt that kept the King of brutes within.
" Now, Monarch of the forest, thou shalt win
Precious enfranchisement, - thy bolts are undone
Tlou art no longer a degraded creature,
But loose to roam with liberty and nature;
Free to search all the jungles about London."

Alas for Freedom, and for Freeclorm's heros
Alas for liberty of life and limb!
For Pug had only half unbolted Nero,
When Nero bolted him!
a'TIS NOT FINE FEATHERS THAT MAKE FINE BIXDM
A PEACOCK came, with his plumage gay.
Strutting in regal pride, one day,
Where a little bird hung in a gilded cage,
Whose song might a seraph's car engage.
The bird sang on, while the peacock stood,
Vaunting his plumes to the neighborhood;
And the radiant sun seemed not more bright
Than the bird that basked in his golden light;
But the little bird sang, in his own sweet words,
"'T is not fine feathers that make fine birds!"
The peacock strutted;--a bird so fair
Never before had ventured there,
While the small bird hung at the cottage door,..
And what could a peacock wish for more?
Alas! the bird of the rainbow wing,
lHe was n't contented,- he tried to sing  
And they who gazed on his beauty bright,
Scared by his screaming, soon took to flight;
While the little bird sang, in his own sweet words,
"'T is not fine feathers that make fine birds!"'
Then, prithee, take warning, maidens fair,
And still of the peacock's fate beware;
Beauty and wealth won't win your way,
Though they're attired in plumage gay;
Something to charm you all must know,
Apart from' fine feathers and outward show;--

15. THE JESTER CONDEMNED TO DEATH. - Horace Smitih.
ONE of the Kings of Scanderoon, a royal jester, had in his train a
gross buffoon, who used to pester the court with tricks inopporturle,
venting on the highest folks his scurvy pleasantries and hoaxes.  It
needs some sense to play the fool; which wholesomle rule occurred not
to our jackanapes, who consequently found his frieaks lead to innumerable scrapes, and quite as many kicks and tweaks; which only mLade
him faster try the patience of his master.
Some sin, at last, beyond all measure, incurred the desperate displeasure of his serene and raging Highness. Whether the wag had
twitched his bheard, which he was bound to have revered, or had
intruded on the.shyness of the seraglio, or let fly an epigram at
royalty, none knows- his sin was an occult one; but records tell us
that the Sultan, meaning to terrify the knave, exclaimed, "'T is
rime to stop that breath! Thy doom is sealed, presumptuous slave!
Thlou stand'st condemned to certain death! Silence, base rebel! Io
replying.  But such is my indulgence still, that, of my own free
grace and will, I leave to thee tthe mode of dying.'  "Your royal
will be done;'t is just," replied the wretch, and kissed the dust;
"since, my last moments to assuage, your majesty's humane decree
has deigned to leave the choice to me, I'11 die, so please you, of old

16. T1HE POET AND THE ALCHEMIST. --Horace Smith.
BEFOREo this present golden age of writers, a Grub-street Garreteer
existed, one of the regular inditers of odes and poems to be twisted
into encomiastic verses, for patrons who have heavy purses. Besides
the bellman's rhymes, he had others to let, both gay and sad, all ticketed from A to Izzard; and, living by his wits, I need not add, the
rogue was lean as any lizard.  Like a rope-maker's were his ways;
for still one line upon another he spun, and, like his hempen brother,
kept going backwards all his days. Hard by his attic lived a chemist,
or alchemist, who had a mighty faith in the Elixir Vitme; and, though

19. THE ELOQUENCE OF ACTION.--Daniel Webster.
WHEN public boclies are to be addressed on momentous occasions,
when great interests are at stake and strong passions excited, nothing
is valuable in speech, further than it is connected with high intellectual and moral endowments. Clearness, force and earnestness, are the
qualities which produce conviction.  True eloquence, indeed, does not
consist in speech. It cannot be brought from far. Labor and learning may toil for it, but they will toil in vain. Words and phrases
may be marshalled in every way, but they cannot compass it. It
must exist in the man, in the subject, and in the occasion. Affected
passion, intense expression, the pomp of declamation, all may aspire
after it,-they cannot reach it. It comes, if it come at all, like the
outbreaking of a fountain from the earth, or the bursting forth of
volcanic fires, with spontaneous, original, native force.  The graces
t;aught in the schools, the costly ornaments and stucied contrivances
of speech, shock and disgust men, when their own lives, and the fate
of their wives, their children, and their country, hang on the decision
of the hour.  Then, words have lost their power, rhetoric is vain, and
all elaborate oratory contemptible.  Even genius itself then feels
rebuked and subdued, as in the presence of higher qualities.  Then,
patriotism is eloquent; then, self-devotion is eloquent.  The clear
conception, outrunning the deductions of logic, the high purpose, the
firm resolve, the dauntless spirit, speaking on the tongue, beaming
from the eye, informing every feature, and urging the whole man
onward, right onward, to his object, --. this, this is eloquence; or, rather,
it is something greater and higher than all eloquence, - it is action,
1noble, sublime, godlike action!

unfiattered by the dimmest glimpses of success, kept gropiJg and
grubbing in his dark vocation; stupidly hoping to find the art of
changing metals, and guineas coin from pots and kettles, by mystery
of transmutation.
Our starving poet took occasion to seek this conjuror's abode; not
with encomiastic ode, or laudatory dedication, but with an offer to
impart, for twenty pounds, the secret art, which should procure, without the pain of metals, chemistry and fire, what he so long had soughlt
in vain, and gratify his heart's desire. The money paid, our bard
was hurried to the philosopher's sanctorum: who, somewhat sublimized,
and flurried out of his chemical decorum, crowed, capered, giggled,
seemed to spurn his crucibles, retort and furnace, and cried, as he
secured the door, and carefully put to the shutter: " Now, now, the
secret, I implore! For Heaven's sake, speak, discover, utter! " With
grave and solemn air, the Poet cried: "List! 0, list! for thus I
show it:-Let this plain truth those ingrates strike, who still, though
blessed, new blessings crave: that we may all have what we like, simply by liking what we have! "
17. BLINDMAN'S BUFF. --Horace Smith.
THREE wags (whom some fastidious carpers might rather designate
three sharpers) entered, at York, the Cat and Fiddle; and, finding
that the host was out on business for two hours or more, while Sam,
the rustic waiter, wore the visage of a simple lout, whom they might
safely try to diddle, - they ordered dinner in a canter, - cold or hot,
it mattered not, provided it was served instanter; and, as the heat
had made them very dry and dusty in their throttles, they bade the
waiter bring three bottles of prime old Port, and one of Sherry.
Sam ran with ardor to the larder, then to the kitchen; and, as he
briskly went to work, he drew from  the spit a roasted turkey, with
sausages embellished, which in a trice upon the board was spread,
together with a nice, cold brisket; nor did he even obliviscate half a,pig's head. To these succeeded puddings, pies, custards and jellieh
all doomed to fall a sacrifice to their insatiable bellies; as if, like camels, they intended to stuff into their monstrous craws enough to satisfy
their maws, until their pilgritnage was ended.  Tl'alking, laughing,
eating and quaffing, the bottles stood no moment* still.  They rallied
Sam with joke and banter, and, as they drained the last decanter,
called for the bill.'T was brought, - when one of them, who eyed and added up the
Itenis, cried, -  "Extremely moderate, indeed! I'11 make a point to
recommend this inn to every travelling friend; and you, Sam, shall
be doubly fee'd."  This said, a weighty purse he drew, when his companion interposed: -" Nay, Harry, that will never do; pray leL
your purse again be closed; you paid all charges yesterday;'t is
clearly now my turn to pay."  Harry, however, would n't listen to
any such insulting offer; his generous eyes appeared to glisten, indig

clangor served but to aggra-vate -lal's anger.  "3My worthy fellow,"
cried the third, "now, really, this is too absurd.  What! do both of
you forget, I have n't paid a farthing, yet? Am I eternally to crati1,
at your expense?'T is childish, quite. I claim this paynment as rmy
right. Here, how much is the money, Sam?"
To this most rational proposal, the others gave such fierce negatiGn,
one might have fancied they were foes, all; so hot became the altlcrca
tion, each in his purse his money rattling, insisting, arguing and battling.  One of them  cried, at last: -"A  truce! This point we
will no longer moot.  Wraingling for trifles is no use; and, thus we'11
fnish the dispute:  That we may settle what we three owe, we'iI
blinidfold Sam, and whichsoe'er he catches of us first shall bear all the
expenses of the trio, with half a crown (if that's enough) to Sam,
for playing blindman's buff."  Sam liked it hugely, - thought the
ransom for a good game of fun was handsome; gave his own handkerchief beside, to have his eyes securely tied, and soon began to grope
and search; when the three knaves, I need n't say, adroitly left him
in the lurch, slipped down the stairs and stole away. Poor Sam. continued hard at work. Now o'er a chair he gets a fall; now floufndering forwards with a jerk, he bobs his nose against the wall; and now
encouraged by a subtle fancy that they're near the door, he jumps
behind it to explore, and breaks his shins against the scuttle; crying,
at each disaster-" Drat it! ITang it!'od rabbit it!" and " Rat it!"
Just in the crisis of his doom, the host, returning, sought the room;
and Sam no sooner heard his tread, than, pouncing on him like a
bruin, he almost shook him into ruin, and, with a shout of laughter,
said: - " Huzza! I've caught you now; so down with cash for all,
and my half crown!"  Off went the bandage, and his eyes seemed
to be goggling o'er his forehead, while his mouth widened with a horrid
look of agonized surprise.  "Gull!" roared his master; " Gudgeon!
dunce! fool, as you are, you're right for once;'t is clear that I nmust
pay the sum; but this one thought my wrath assuages - that every
half--penny shall come out of your wages! "
18. THE FARMER AND THE COUNSELLOR. -IHorace Smith.
A COUNSEL in the Common Pleas, who was esteemed a mighty wit,
upon the strength of a chance hit, amid a thousand flippancies, and his
occasional bad jokes, in bullying, bantering, browbeating, ridiculing
and maltreating women, or other timid folks, --in a late cause,
resolved to hoax a clownish Yorkshire farmer, -one, who, by his
uncouth look and gait, appeared expressly meant by Fate for being
quizzed and played upon.  So, having tipped the wink to those in the
back rows, who kept their laughter bottled down until our wag should.draw the cork, he smiled jocosely on the clown, and went to work.
"Well, Farmer Numscull, how go calves at York? "  I" Why - not,
sir, as they do wi' you; but on four legs, instead of two"' Oticer 9'

sr;ed the legal elf, piqued at the laugh agaipst himself, " do pray keep
silence down oelow, there.  Now, look at me, clown, and attend; have
I not seen you somewhere, friend? "  "Yes, very like; I often go
there.;'  "Our rustic's waggish - quite laconic! " the counsel
cried, with grin sardonic; "I wish I'd known this prodigy, this
genius of the clods, when I on. circuit was at York residing.  Now,
iarmer, do for once speak true; mind, you're on oath, so tell me,'you who doubtless think yourself so clever, are there as many fools as
ever in the West Riding?"    "Why, no Sir, no; we've got our
share, - but not so many as when you were there."
19. MR. PUFF'S ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF.--Sheridan.
SIR, I make no secret of the trade I follow. Among friends and
brother authors, I love to be frank on the subject, and to advertise
myself viva voce. I am, Sir, a practitioner in panegyric; or, to speak
more plainly, a professor of the art of puffing, at your service - or
anybody else's. I dare say, now, you conceive half the very civil
paragraphs and advertisements you see to be written by the parties
-concerned, or their friends.  No such thing; nine out of ten manufactured by me, in the way of business.  You must know, Sir, that,
from the first time I tried my hand at an advertisement, my success
was such, that for some time after I led a most extraordinary life,
indeed.  Sir, I supported myself two years entirely by my misfortunes; by advertisements To the charitable and humane! and, To
those whom Providence has blessed with affluence!  And, in truth,
I deserved what I got; for I suppose never man went through such a
series of calamities in the same space of time. Sir, I was five times
made a bankrupt, and reduced from a state of affluence, by a train of'
unavoidable misfortunes; then, Sir, though a very industrious tradesman, I was twice burned out, and lost my little all both times.  I
lived upon those fires a month. I. soon after was confined by a most
excruciating disorder, and lost the use of my limbs.  That told very
well; for I had the case strongly attested, and went abdut to collect
the subscriptions myself. I was afterwards twice tapped for a dropsy,
which declined into a very profitable consumption.   I was then
reduced to -0, no!   then I became a widow, with six helpless children. All this I bore with patielnce, though I made some occasional
attempts at felo de se; but, as I did not find those rash actions answer,
I left off killing myself very soon.  Well, Sir, at last, what with
bankruptcies, fires, gouts, dropsies, imprisorments, and other valuable
calamities, having got together a pretty handsome sum, I determinedi
to quit a business which had always gone`rather against my conscience,
and in a more liberal way still to indulge\my talents for fiction and
embellishments, throu(gh my favorite channel of diurnal communica.

MISCELLANEOUS.
1 ADDRESS OF BLACK HAWK TO GENERAL STREET.
You have taken me prisoner, with all my warriors. I am11 much
gieved; for I expected, if I did not defeat you, to hold out much
longer, and give you more trouble, before I surrendered.  I tried
hard to bring you into ambush, but your last General understood
Indian fighting.  I determined to rush on you, and fight you face to
face. I fought hard. But your guns were well aimed. The bullets
flew like birds in the air, and whizzed by our ears like the wvild
throuigh the trees in winter. My warriors fell around me; it began
to look dismal.  I saw my evil day at hand. The sun rose dim on us
in the morning, and at night it sank in a dark cloud, and looked like
a ball of fire. That was the last sun that shone on Black Hawk.
his heart is dead, and no longer beats quick in his bosom. He is now
a prisoner to the white men; they will do with him as they wish.
But he can stand torture, and is not afraid of death. He is no coward. Black Hawk is an Indian.
He has done nothing for which an Indian ought to be ashame(d. lie
has fought for his countrymen, against white men, who came, year
after year, to cheat them, and take away their lands. You know the
cause of our making war. It is known to all white men. They
ought to be ashamed of it. The white men despise the Indians, and
drive them from their homes. They smile -in the face of the poor
Indian, to cheat him; they shake him by the hand, to gain his confidence, to make him drunk, and to deceive him. We told thern to let
us alone, and keep away from us; but they followed on and beset our
paths, and they coiled themselves among us like the snake. They
poisoned us by their touch. We were not safe. We lived in dangecr.
We looked up to the Great Spirit.  We went to our father. WeT
wel. encouraged. His great council gave us fair words and big promises; but we. got no satisfaction: things were growing worse. There
were no deer in the forest. The opossum and beaver were fled. The'springs were drying up, and our squaws and pappooses without
victuals to keep them from starving.

up tne war-whoop, and dug up the tomahawk; our knives were ready,
and the heart of Black Hawk swelled high in his bosom, wh,cn he led
his warriors to battle.  He is' satisfied. He will go to the world of
spirits contented.  He has done his duty.  His fiather will meet him
there, and commend him. Black Hawk is a true Indian, and disdains
to cry like a woman. He feels for his wife, h'is children, and his
friends. But he does not care for himself.  He cares for the Nation
and the Indians.  They will suffer.  He laments their fate.  Faret
well, my Nation! Black Hawk tried to save you, and avenge your
wrongs. He drank the blood of some of the whites. He has been
taken prisoner, and his plans are crushed.  He can do no more. Ito
is near his end. His sun is setting, and he will rise no more.  Fare.
well to Black Hawk!
2. TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR, 1824. - Pushmataha. Born, 1764; died, 1824.
FATHER- I have been here at the council-house some time; but I
have not talked. I have not been strong enough to talk. You shall
hear me talk to-day. I belong to another district. You have, no
doubt, heard of me. I am Pushmataha.
Father- When in my own country, I often looked towards this
council-house, and wanted to come here.  I am in trouble.  I will
tell my distresses.  I feel like a small child, not half as high as its
father, who comes up to look in his father's face, hanging in the bend
of his arm, to tell him his troubles. So, father, I hang in the bend
of your arm, and look in your face; and now hear me speak.
Father - When I was in my own country, I heard there were mein
appointed to talk to us.  I would not speak there; I chose to come
here, and speak in this beloved house; for Pushliataha can boast, and
say, and tell the truth, that none of his fathers, or grandfathers, or
any Choctaw, ever drew bow against the United States.  They have
always been friendly. We have held the hands of the United States
so long, that Olur nails are long like birds' claws; and there is no
danger of their slipping out.
Father -I h;: v, come to speak. My nation has always listened to
the applications of the white people. They have given of their
country till it is very small.  I came here, when a young man, to see
my Father Jefferson. He told me, if ever we got in trouble, we must
run and tell him. I am   come. This is a firiendly talk; it is lik(e
that of a man who nieets another, and says, How do you do? An.
other of my tribe shall talk further.  He shall say what Pushmatahs
would say, were he stronger.
3 SUPPOSED SPEECH OF A CHIEF OF THE POCOMiNTUC INDIANS. - Edward Evereut.
WHITE man, there is eternal war between me and thee! I quit not
the land of my fathers but with my life. In'those woods where I
bent my youthful bow, I will still hunt the deer.  Over yondel
552wateis I will still glide unrestrained in my bark canoe. By those dashing waterfills I will'still lay up my winter's store of food. On these
fertile meadows I will still plant my corn.  Stranger, the land is
mine! I understand not these paper rights.  I gave not my consent
when, as thou sayest, these broad regions were purchased, for a few
baubles, of my fathers.  They could sell what was theirs; they could
sell no more. How could my fathers sell that which the Great Spirit
sent me into the world to live upon?  They knew not what they did.
The stranger came, a timid suppliant, few and feeble, and asked to lie
down on the red man's bear-skin, and warm himself at the red man's
dre, and have a little piece of land to raise corn for his womien amdl
children; and now he is become strong, and mighty, and bold, and
spreads out his parchment over the whole, and says, It is mine.
Stranger, there is not room for us both.  The Great Spirit has not
made us to live together.  There is poison in the white man's cup; the
white man's dog barks at the red man's heels.
If I should leave the land of my fathers, whither shall I fly? Shall
I go to the South, and dwell among the graves of the Pequots? Shall I
wander to the West? - the fierce Mohawk, the man-eater, is my foe.
Shall I fly to the East? - the great water is before me. No, stranger;
here I have lived, and here I will die! and if here thou abidest, there is
eternal war between me and thee.  Thou hast taught me thy arts of
destruction.  For that alone I thank thee; and now take heed to thy
steps; - the red man is thy foe. When thou goest forth by day, my
bullet shall whistle by thee; when thou liest down at night, my knife
is at thy throat.  The noonday sun shall not discover thy enemy, and
the darkness of midnight shall not protect thy rest. Thou shalt plant
in terror, and. I will reap in blood; thou shalt sow the earth with corn,
and I will strew it with ashes; thou shalt go forth with the sickle, and
I will follow after with the scalping-knife; thou shalt build, and I will
burn, till the white man or the Indian shall cease from the land. Go
thy way, for this time, in safety; but remember, stranger, there is
eternal war between me and thee!
4. LOGAN, A MINGO CHIEF, TO LORD DUNMOREF
The charge against Colonel Cresap, in the subjoined speech, - or, rather, message, - sent to
Lord Dunmore, Governor of Virginia, in 1774, through John Gibson, an Indian trader, has been
proved to be untrue. Gibson corrected Logan on the spot, but probably felt bound to deliver
the speech as it was delivered to him.
I APPEAL to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's cal in
hungry, and he gave him not meat; if ever he came cold and naked,
---and he clothed him not. During the course of the last lonlg and
bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace.
Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed at me
as they passed, and said, " Logan is the friend of white men."  I had
even thought to have lived with you, but for the injuries of one man.
Colonel C(resap, the last spring, in cold blood, and unprovoled, murdered all the relations of Logan, not sparing even my women and chilb53

YE who would save your features florid,
Lithe limbs, bright eyes, unwirinkled forehead,
From Age's devastation horrid,
Adopt this plan, -'T will make, in climate cold or torrid,
A hale old man:
Avoid, in youth, luxurious diet;
Restrain the passions' lawless riot;
Devoted to domestic quiet,
Be wisely gay;
So shall ye, spite of Age's fiat,
Resist decay.
Seek not, in MIammon's wvorship, pleasure;
But find your richest, dearest treasure,
In books, friends, music, polished leisure:
The mind, not sense,
Made the sole;scale by which to measure
Your opulence.
This is the solace. this the science,
Life's purest, sweetest, best appliance,
That disappoints not man's reliance,
Whate'er his state;
But challenges, with calm defiance.
Time, fortune, fate.

No smiling courtiers tread;
One silent woman stands,
Lifting, with meagre hands,
A dying head.
No mingling voices sound,An infant wail alone;
A sob suppressed, - again
That short, deep gasp, and then
The parting groan.

Burst are the prison bars,This moment, there, so low,
So agonized, and now
Beyond the stars!

HOPE leads the child to plant the flower, the man to sow the seed,
Nor leaves fulfilment to her hour, but prompts again to deed.
And ere upon the old man's dust the grass is seen to wave,
We look through falling tears to trust Hope's sunshine on the grava.
O no! it is no flattering lure, - no fancy weak or fond, -
When hope would bid us rest secure in better life beyond.
Nor loss, nor shame, nor grief, nor sin, her promise may gainsay;
The voice divine hath spoke within, and God did ne'er betray.

reath out-wrings, and his,corse down flings
To the dark pit where grave-worms feed on kings?.Death!
When the murderer's undetected, when the robber's unsuspected,
And night has veiled his crime from every eye, -
When nothing living daunts him, and no fear of justice haunts him,  i
Who wakes his conscience-stricken agony?
Who makes him start, with his withering dart,
And wrings the secret from his bursting heart? -

If from the soul the language does not come,
By its own impulse, to impel the hearts
Of hearers with communicated power,
In vain you strive, in vain you study earnestly, -
Toil on forever, piece together fragments,Cook up your broken scraps of sentences,
And blow, with puffing breath, a struggling light,
Glimmering confusedly now, now cold in ashes, -
Startle the school-boys with your metaphors,And, if such food may suit your appetite,
Win the vain wonder of applauding children!
But never hope to stir the hearts of men,
And mould the souls of many into one,
By words which come not native from the heart!
21. TIIE CHRISTIAN ORATOR.--Original translation from Villemain.
1By the introduction of Christianity, a tribune was erected, from
which the most sublime truths were boldly announced to all the world;
from which the purest lessons of morality were made familiar to the
ignorant multitude; a tribune so authoritative, so august, that before
it Emperors, soiled with the blood of the People, were humbled; a;
tribune so pacific and tutelary, that more than once it has given reftge
to its mortal enemies; a tribune, from which many an interest, abandoned everywhere else, was long defended; a tribune which, singly
and eternally, has pleaded the cause of the poor against the rich, of
the oppressed against the oppressor, and of man against himself.
There, all becomes ennobled and deified.  The Christian orator,
with his mastery over the minds of his hearers, elevating and startling
themn by turns, can reveal to them a destiny grander than glory, or
terribler than death. From the highest Heavens he can draw down
an eternal hope to the tomb, where Pericles could bring only tributary
lamentations and tears. If, with the Roman orator, he commemorates
the warrior fallen on the field of battle, he gives to the soul of the
departed that immortality which Cicero dared promise only to his
renown, he charges Deity itself with the acquittal of a country's
gratitude.
Would the orator confine himself to evangelical preaching? That
science of morals, that experience of mankind, those secrets of the
passions, which were the constant study of the philosophers and orators
of antiquity, ought to be his, also, to command.  It is for him, even
A54TTHE STANDARD SPEAKER.
TPZere is a solemn sanctuary, founded
By God himself; not for transgressors meant;
But that the man oppressed, the spirit-wounded,. And all beneath the world's injustice bent,
Might turn from outward wrong, turmoil and din.
To peace within
Each bosom is a temple, - when its altar,
The living heart, is unprofaned and pure,
Its verge is hallowed; none need fear or falter
Who thither fly; it is an ark secure,
Winning, above a world o'erwhelmed with wrath,
Its peaceful path.
O, Bower of Bliss! O, sanctuary holy!
Terrestrial antepast of heavenly joy,
Never, O, never may misdeed or folly
My claim to thy beatitudes destroy!
Still may I keep this Paradise unlost,
Where'er I'm tost!
E'en in the flesh, the spirit disembodied,
Unchecked by time and space,, may soar elate,
In silent awe to commune with the Godhead,Or the millennium reign anticipate,
WVhen Earth shall be all sanctity and love,
Like Heaven above.
How sweet to turn from anguish, guilt and madness,
From scenes where strife and tumult never cease,
To that Elysian world of bosomed gladness,
Where all is concord, charity and peace;
And, sheltered from the storm, the soul may rest
On its owvn nest!
When, spleenful as the sensitive Mimosa,
We shrink from Winter's touch and Nature's gloom,
There may we conjure up a Vallombrosa,
Where groves and bowers in Summner beauity bloom,
And the heart dances in the sunny glade
Fancy has made.
But, would we dedicate to nobler uses
This bosom sanctuary, let us there
I-Iallow our hearts from all the world's abuses;,While high and charitable thoughts, and pr'yer
May teach us gratitude to God, combined

more than it was for them, to know all the windings of the hmnan
heart, all the vicissitudes of the emotions, all the sensibilities of the
soul; not with a view to exciting those violent affections, those popular animosities, those fierce kindlings of. passion, those fires of vengeance and of hate, in the outbursts of which the triumph of ancient
eloquence was attained; but to appease, to soften, to purify, the soul.
Armed against all the passions, without the privilege of availing himself of any, he is obliged, as it were, to create a new passion, if by
that name we may profane the profound, the sublime sentiment, which
can alone vanquish and replace all others in the heart, - an intelli&gt;
gent religious enthusiasm; and it is that, which should impart to his
elocution, to his thoughts, to his words, rather the inspiration of a
prophet than the art and manner of an orator.
22. AFFECTATION IN TIlE PULPIT.- -William Cowper. Born, 1731; died, 1800.
IN man or woman, - but far most in man,
And most of all in man that ministers
And serves the altar, - in my soul I loathe
All affectation.'T is my perfect scorn;
Object of my implacable disgust.
What! - will a man play tricks,- will he indulge
A silly, fond conceit of his fair form,
And just proportion, fashionable mien,
And pretty face, - in presence of his God?
Or will he seek to dazzle me with tropes,
As with the diamond on his lily hand,
And play his brilliant parts before my eyes,
When I am hungry for the bread of life?
He mocks his Maker, prostitutes and shames
His noble office, and, instead of truth,
Displaying his own beauty, starves his flock!
Therefore, avaunlt all attitude, and stare,
And start theatric, practised at the glass!
I seek divine simplicity in him
Who handles things divine; and all besides,
Though learned with labor, and though much admired
By curious eyes and judgments ill-informed,
To me is odious as the nasal twang
Heard at conventi(le, where worthy men,
Misled by custom strain celestial themes
Through the pressed nostril, spectacle-bestrid.
I venerate the man whose heart is warm,
Whose hands are pure, whose doctrine and whose life,
Coincident, exhibit lucid proof
That he is honest in the sacred cause.
To such I render more than mere respect,
05THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
Whose actions say that they respect themselves
But loose in morals, and in manners vain,
In conversation frivolous, in dress
Extreme, at once rapacious and profuse;
Frequent in park with lady at his side,
Ambling and prattling scandal as he goes  
But rare at home, and never at his books,
Or with his pen, save when he scrawls a card
Constant at routs, familiar with a round
Of ladyships'- a stranger to the poor;
Ambitious of preferment for its gold;
And well prepared, by ignorance and sloth,
By infidelity and love of world,
To make God's work a sinecure; a slave
To his own pleasures and his patron's pride;--
From such apostles, 0, ye riitred heads,
Preserve the Church! and lay not careless hands
On skulls that cannot teach, and will not learn!
C2. UTILITY OF HISTORY.--Original Translation from De Sgur. B. 173; d. 1830
WHATEVER your career, a knowledge of history will always be to
you a source of profit and delight.  Examples strike deeper than
precepts. They serve as proofs to convince, and as images to attract.
History gives us the experience of the world, and the collective reason
of ages. We are organized like men of the remotest times; we have
the same virtues and the same vices; and, hurried forward, like them,
by our passions, we listen witll distrust to those warnings of wisdoml
which would thwart our inclinations.  But History is an impartial
instructor, whose reasonings, which are facts, we cannot gainsay.  It
exhibits to us the Past, to prefigure the Future.  It is the mirror of
tiuth.  Nations and men, the most renowned, are judged in our eyes
from a point of time which destroys all illusion, and with a singleness
of purpose which no surviving interest can mislead.
Before the tribunal of History, conquerors descend from their triumphal cars; tyrants are no longer formidable by their satellites;
princei appear before us unattended by their retinue, and stripped of
that false grandeu'r with which Flattery saw them invested. You
detest, without danger, the ferocity of Nero, the cruelties of Sylla,
the hypocrisy of Tiberius, the licentiousness of Caligflla.  If youl
have seen Dionysius terrible at Syracuse, you behold him humbled at
Corinth. The plaudits of an inconstant multitude do not delude
your judgment in favor of the envious traducers of the good and
great; and you follow, with enthusiasm, the virtuous Socrates to his
prison, the just Aristides into exile.  If you admire the valor of
Alexander on the banks of the Granicus, on the plains of Arbela,--
you condemn, without fear, that unmeasured ambition which hurriedlMORAL AND DIDACTIC, - C1lA3IMERS.

tarnished the close of his career.  The love of liberty, cherished by
the Greeks. may kindle your soul; but their jealousies, their fickleness, their ingratitude, their sanguinary quarrels, their corruption of
manners, at once annrounce and explain to you their ruin.  If Rome,
with her colossal power, excite your astonishment, you shall not fail
soon to distinguish the virtues which constituted her grandeur, froi
the vices which precipitated her fall. Every-where shall you recognize the proof of this antique maxim, that, in the end, only what is
honest is useful; that we are truly great only through justice, and
entirely happy only through virtue.  Time dispenses equitably its
recompenses and its chastisements; and we may measure the growth
and the decline of a People by the purity or corruption of their morals.
Virtue is the enduring cement of the power of Nations; and without
that, their ruin is inevitable!
24. FALSE COLORING LENT TO WAR.- Thomas Chalmers. Born, 1780; died, 1847.
ON every side of me I see causes at work which go to spread a
most delusive coloring over war, and to remove its shocking barbarities
to the back-ground of our contemplations altogether. I see it in the
history which tells me of the superb appearance of the troops, and thi
brilliancy of their successive charges.  I see it in the poetry whict
lends the magic of its numbers to the narrative of blood, and transports its nmany admirers, as by its images, and its figures, and its nodding plumes of chivalry, it throws its treacllerous embellishments over
a scene of legalized slaughter.  I see it in the music which represents
the progress of the battle; and where, after being inspired by the
trumpet-notes of preparation, the whole beauty and tenderness of a
drawing-room are seen to bend over' the sentimental entertainment;
nor do I hear the utterance of a single sigh to interrupt, the deathtones of the thickening contest, and the moans of the wounded men,
as they fade away upon the ear, and sink into lifeless silence.
All, all, goes to prove what strange and half-sighted creatures we
are.  Were it not so, war could never have been seen in any other
aspe-t than that of unmingled hatefulness; and I can look to nothing
but to the progress of Christian sentiment upon earth to arrest the
strong current of the popular and prevailingy partiality for war. Then
onlffy will an imperious sense of duty lay the cheek of severe pritciple on all the subordinate tastes and fitculties of our nature.  Then
will glory be reduced to its right estimate, and the wakeful benevolence of the Gospel, chasing away every spell, will be turned by the
treachery of no delusion w'hatever from its simple but sublime enter.
prises for the good of the species.  Then the reign of truth and quietness will be ushered into the world, and war --  cruel, atr.cious,
unrelenting war- will be stripped of its many and its bewildering
fascinations.

It will be seen that the oratory of the ancients has supplied an unusua,

been imparted here, by original translations. We have had little, in
m3dern times, to surpass the Philippics of Demosthenes or the fiery
invective of2 Eschines. The putative speeches from Livy, Tacitus, and
Sallust, have been newly translated or adapted. In two or three instances,
the translation has been so liberal that a nearer relationship to the original
than that of a paraphrase has not been claimed. The speeches of Brutus,
Caius Marius, Canuleius, Virginius, and others, have been expanded or
abridged, to serve the purpose of declamation. The two speeches of Spartacus, that of Regulus, with several othets, are now, for the first time,
published. The extracts from that strangely depreciated work, Cowper's
Homer, have the vivid simplicity and force of the original, and are among
the most appropriate exercises for elocution in the whole scope of Eng.
lish blank verse.
Throughout the present volume, in deciding upon the insertion of a
piece, the question has been, not "Who wrote it? " or, "What country
produced it' " but, " Is it good for the purpose "  Like other arts, that
of eloquence is unhedged by geographical lines; and it is as inconsistent
with true culture, to confine pupils to American models in this art, as it
would be in sculpture or painting. While exercising great freedom of
range in selection, however, it has been the editor's study to meet all the
demands of a liberal patriotism; to do justice to all the noblest masters
of eloquence, and to all schools and styles, from which a grace may be
borrowed; and, above all, to admit nothing that could reasonably offend
the ear of piety and good taste.
The Introductory Treatise embodies the views, not only of the editor,
but of rnmny of our most experienced and distinguished teachers, in regard
to the ullu;luliti:Dtle character of those'" systems " which profess to teach
reading and speaking by the rule and plummet of sentential analysis or
rhetorical notation. Of these attempts the pupil may well exclaim, in the
words of Cowper, -
"Defend me, therefore, common sense, say I,
From reveries so airy, - from the toil
Of dropping buckets into empty wells,
And growing old in drawing nothing up!"
The preceptive portion of the Treatise presents no particular claim to origp
nality; the object being merely to give a summary of all the discoveries
and hints that can be serviceable to the student, in the development of
his vocal and elocutionary powers.

PREFACE.THE STANDARD SPEAKER.
JZ DEAIH'S FINAL CONQUEST.--James Shirley. Born, 1594; died, 196/
THE glories of our blood and state
Are shadows, not substantial tlilngs;
There is no armor against Fate;
Death lays his icy hand on ICings!
Sceptre, Crown,
Must tumble down,
And in the dust be equal made
With the poor crooked scythe and spade.
Some men with swordls may reap the field,
And plant fresh laurels where they kill;
But their strong nerves at last must yield, -
They tame but one another still.
Early or late,
They stoop to Fate,
And must give up their conquering breath,
When they, pale captives, creep to Death.
The garlands witlher on your brow!Then boast no more your mighty deeds:
Upon Death's purple altar now
See where tlhe victor-victim bleeds!
All heads must come
To the cold tomb:
Only the actions of the just
Smell sweet, and blossom in the dust.
5. RELIGION OF REVOLUTIONARY 3MEN.--Original Adaptation from Lamartine.
I KNOW--I sigh when I think of it-that hitherto the French
People have been the least religious of all the Nations of Europe.
The great men of other countries live and die on the scene of history,
looking up to Heaven.  Our great men live and die looking at the
spectator; or, at most, at posterity.  Open the history of America,
the history of England, and the history of France.  Washington
and Franklin fought, spoke and suffered, always in the name of God,
for whom they acted; and the liberator of America died confiding to
God the liberty of the People and his own soul. Sidlney, the young
martyr of a patriotism guilty of nothing but impatience. and who
died to expiate his country's dream of liberty, said to his jailer, "I
r-ejoice that I die innocent toward the king, but a victim, resigned to
the King oni High, to whom all life is due."  The Republicans of
Cr]omwell sought only the way of God, even in the blood of battles.
But look at Mirabeau on the bed of death.'O rown me with flowers' said he; "intoxicate me with perfumes. Let me die to the
sound of delicious music."  Not a word was there of God or of his

otwn soul!  Sensual philosopher, supreme sensualism was his last
desire in his agony! Contemplate Madame Roland, the strong-hearted
woman of the Revolution, on the cart that conveyed her to death.
Not a glance toward Heaven! Only one word for the earth she was
quitting: "0 O Liberty, what crimes in thy name are committed!"
Approaclh the dungeon door of the Girondins. Their last night is a
banquet,- tlheir only hymn the Marseillaise! Hear Danton on the
platiform of the scaffold: " I have had a good time of it; let me go
to sleep."  Then, to the executioner: "You will show my head to the
People; it is worth the trouble!"  His faith, annihilation; his last
sigh, vanity!
B]ehold the Frenchman of this latter age! WVhat must one think of
the religious sentiment of a free People, whose great figures seem thus
to march in procession to annihilation, and to whom death itself recalls
neither the threatenings nor the promises of God! The Republic
of these men without a God was quickly stranded. The liberty, won
by so much heroism and so much genius, did not find in France a conscience to shelter it, a God to avenge it, a People to defend it, against
that Atheism which was called glory. All ended in a soldier, and
some apostate republicans travestied into courtiers.  An atheistic
Republicanism  cannot be heroic. When you terrify it, it yields.
When you would buy it, it becomes venal. It would be very foolish
to immolate itself. Who would give it credit for the sacrifice, - the
People ungrateful, and God non-existent?  So finish atheistic Rev.

THou neither dost persuade me to seek wealth
For empire's sake, nor empire to affect
For glory's sake, by all thy arguiment.
Extol not riches, then, the toil of fools,
The wise man's cumbrance, if not snare; more apt
To slacken Virtue, and abate her edge,
Than prompt her to do aught may merit praise
WVhat if, with like aversion, I reject
Riches and realms? Yet not, for that a Crown,
Golden in show, is but a wreath of thorns, -
Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights
For herein stands the virtue of a King,
That for the public all this weight he bears:Yet he, who reigns within himself, and rules
Passions, desires and fears, is more a King!
This, every wise and virtuous man attains,
And who attains not, ill aspires to rule
Cities of men, or headstrong multitudes,--
Subject himself to anarchy within!
To know, and, knowing, worship God aright,

Xs yet.noie kingly: this attracts the soul,
Governs the inner man, the nobler part
That other o'er the body only reigns,
And oft by force, which, to a generous mind
So reigning, can be no sincere delight.
They err who count it glorious to subdue
Great cities by assault.  What do these worthie
But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter and enslave
Peaceable Nations, neighboring or remote,
Alade captive, yet deserving freedom more
Than those their conquerors, who leave behind
Nothing but ruin wheresoe'er they rove,
And all the flourishing works of peace destroy;
Then swell with pride, and must be titled G-ods,
Great benefactors of mankind, deliverers,
Worshipped with temple, priest, and sacrifie?
One is the son of Jove, of Mars the other;
Till conqueror Death discover themn scarce men,
Rolling in brutish vices, and deformed,Violent or shamleful death their due reward!
But, if there be in glory aught of good,
It may by means far different be attained,
Without ambition, war, or violence;
By deeds of peace, by wisdomn eminent,
By patience, temperance.
Shall I seek glory, then, as vain men seek,
Oft not deserved? I seek not mine, but His

28. NOBILITY OF LABOR.- Rev. Orville Dewey.
i CALL upon those whom 1 address to stand up for the nobility of
lyx'.r.  It is Heaven's great ordinance for humnan improvement.  Let
not that great ordinance be broken down.  What do I say?   It is
broken down; and it has been broken down, for ages.  Let it, then,
be built up again; here, if anywhere, on these shores of a new
world, -of a new civilization.  But how, I may be asked, is it
broken down?  Do not men toil? it may be said.  They do, indeed,
teil; but they too generally do it because they must. Many siubmit to
it as, in some sort, a degrading necessity; and they desire nothing so
mnuch on earth as escape from it. They fulfil the great law of lalor
in the letter, but break it in the spirit; fulfil it with the muscle, but
break it with the mind.  To some field of labor, mental or manual,
every idler should fasten, as a chosen and coveted theatre of improvement.  But so is he not impelled to do, under the teachings of
our imperfect civilization.  On the contrary, he sits down, folds his
ancd-. and blesses himself in his idleness.  This way of thinking isMORAL AND DIDACTIC.- OSGOOD.

miother Nature has embroidered, midst sun and rain, midst fire andl
steam, her own heraldic honors? Ashamed of these tokens and titles,

29. LABOR IS WORSHIP.--Frances S. Osgood. Born, 1812; died, 1850.
Laborare est orare--To labor is to pray.
PAUSE not to dream of the future before us;
Pause not to weep the wild cares that come o'er us;
Hark, how Creation's deep, musical chorus,
Unintermitting, goes up into Heaven!
Never the ocean wave falters in flowing;
Never the little seed stops in its growing;
More and more richly the rose-heart keeps glowing,
Till from its nourishing stem it is riven.
"Labor is worship! " - the robin is singing;
"Labor is worship!"--the wild bee is ringing:
Listen! that eloquent whisper upspringing
Speaks to thy soul from out Nature's great heart.
From the dark cloud flows the life-giving shower;
From the rough sod blows the soft-breathing flower;
From the small insect, the rich coral bower;
Only man, in the plan, shrinks from his part.
Labor is life!'T is the still water faileth;
Idleness ever despaireth, bewaileth;
Keep the watch wound, for the dark rust assaileth;
Flowers droop and die in the stillness of noon.
Labor is glory! - the flying cloud lightens;
Only the waving wing changes and brightens
Idle hearts only the dark future frightens;
Play the sweet keys, wouldst thou keep them in tune!
Labor is rest from the sorrows that greet us,
Rest from all petty vexations that meet us,
Rest from sin-promptings that ever entreat us,
Rest from world-sirens that lure us to ill.
Work - and pure slumbers shall wait on thy pillow;
Work - thou shalt ride over Care's coming billow'

]',(o cause is so bound up with religion as the cause of political
Libe,,ty and the rights of man.  Unless I have read history backward, -munless Milagna Charta is a mistake, and the Bill of Rights
a sham, and the Declaration of Independence a contui1macious falsehood, - unless the sages, and heroes, and martyrs, who have fought
and bled, were impostors,- unless the sublimest transactions in modern history, on Tower Hill, in the Parliamenlts of London, on the

cause so linked with religion as the cause of Democratic liberty.
And, Sir, not only are all the moral principles, which we can summon up, on the side of this great cause, but the physical movements
of t;he age attend it and advance it.  Nature is Republican. The discoveries of Science are Republican. Sir, what are these new forces,

What are they but the servitors of the People, and not of a clas?

Great in the Earth, as in the ethereal frame,
WVarms in the Sun, refreshes in the breeze,

Lives through all life, extends through all extent
Spreads undivided, operates unspent;
Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part,
As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart;
As full, as perfect, in vile Man that lnourns,
As the rapt Seraph that adores and burns:
To Him, no high, no low, no great, no small;
He fills, He bounds, connects, and equals all.

Of blindness, weakness, HIeaven bestows on thee.

Or in the natal, or the mortal hour.
All Nature is but Art, unknown to thee;
All Chance, Direction, which thou canst not see;

ever the vast region from the frigid to the torrid, from the Eastern to
the Western Ocean, every variety of climate giving them choice of
pursuit and modification of temperament, the ballot-box fusing together
all rivalries, they shall have one national will. What is wanting in
one race will be supplied by the characteristic energies of the other;
and what is excessive in either, checked by the counter action of the
rest. Nay, though for a time the newly-come may retain their foreign
vernacular, our tongue, so rich in ennobling literature, will be the
tongue of the Nation, the language of its laws, and the accent of its
majesty. Eternal God, who seest the end with the beginning, Thou
alone canst tell the ultimate grandeur of this People!
Such, Gentlemen, is the sphere, present and future, in which God
calls us to work for Him, for our country, and for mankind. The
language in which we utter truth will be spoken on this Continent, a
century hence, by thirty times more millions than those dwelling on the
island of its origin. The openings for trade on the Pacific coast, and
the railroad across the Isthmius, will bring the commerce of the world
under the control of our race.  The empire of our language will

THE great distinction of a Nation--the only one worth possessing,
and which brings after it all other blessings - is the prevalence of
pure principle among the Citizens. I wish to belong to a State in
the character and institutions of which I may find a spring of improvement, which I can speak of with an honest pride; in whose
ro,cords I may meet great and honored nanles, and which is fast making the world its debtor by its discoveries of truth, and by an example
of virtuous freedom.  0, save me from a country which worships
wealth, and cares not for true glory; in which intrigue bears rule; in
which patriotism borrows its zeal from the prospect of office; in which
hungry sycophants throng with supplication all the departments of
State; in which public men bear the brand of private vice, and the
seat of Government is a noisome sink of private licentiousness a.d
Fublic corruption.

35. WHAT MAKES A HEIRO? -Henry Taylor.
WHAT makes a hero? - not success, not fame,
Inebriate merchants, and the loud acclaim
Of glutted Avarice, - caps tossed up in air,
Or pen of journalist with flourish fair;
Bells pealed, stars, ribbons, and a titular name -
These, though his rightfuil tribute, he can spare;
His rightful tribute, not his end or aim,
Or true reward; for never yet did these
Refresh the soul, or set the heart at ease.
What makes a hero? - An heroic mind,
Expressed in action, in endurance proved.
And if there be preeminence of right,
Derived through pain well suffered, to the height
Of rank heroic,'t is to bear unmoved,
Not toil, not risk, not rage of sea or wind,
Not the brute fury of barbarians blind,
But worse - ingratitude and poisonous darts,
Launched by the country he had served and loved;
This, with a free, unclouded spirit pure,
This, in the strength of silence to endure,
A dignity to noble deeds imparts,
Beyond the gauds and trappings of renown.
This is the hero's comnplement and crown;
This missed, one struggle had been wanting still, -
One glorious triumph of the heroic will,
One self-approval in his heart of hearts.
36. THE LAST HOURS OF SOCIRATES. - Original Adaptation.
SOCRATES was the reverse of a sceptic. No man ever looked upon
life with a more positive and practical eye. No man ever pursued his
mark with a clearer perception of the roacl wlhich he was travelling.
No man ever combined, in like manner, the absorbing enthusiasm of a
missionary, with the acuteness, the originality, the inventive resources,
66MORAL AND DIDACTIC. - YANKEE.
and the generalizing comprehension, of a philosopher. And yet this
man was condemned to death, -condemned by a hostile tribunal of
more than five hundred citizens of Athens, drawn at hazard from all
classes of society. A majority of six turned the scale, in the most'
momentous trial that, up to that time, the world had witnessed,
And the vague charges on which Socrates was condemned were, that
he was a vain babbler,. a corrupter of youth, and a setter-forth of
L.trar ge Gods!
It would be t.empting to enlarge on the closing scene of his life, - a
scene whiche Plato has invested with such immortal glory; - on the
affecting farewell to the Judges; on the long thirty days whichl passed
in prison before the execution of the verdict; on his playful equlanimity, amid the uncontrollable emotions of his companions; on the
gathering in of that solemn evening, when the fadinC of the sunset
hues on the tops of the Athenian hills was the signal that the last
hour was at hand; on the introduction of the fatal hemlock; the
immovable countenance of Socrates, the firm hand, and then the
burst of frantic lamentation from all his friends, as, with his habitual
ease and cheerfulness, he drained the cup to its dregs; then the solemn silence enjoined by himself; the pacing to and fro; the strong
religious persuasions attested by his last words; the cold palsy of the
poison creeping from the extremities to the heart; the gradual torpor
ending in death! Bu-Lt I must forbear.
0 for a modern spirit like his! 0 for one hour of Socrates! 0
for one hour of that voice whose questioning would make men see
what they knew, and what they did not know; what they meant, and
what they only thought they meant; what they believed in truth, and
what they only believed in name; wherein they agreed, and wherein
they differed. That voice. is, indeed, silent; but there is a voice in
each man's heart and conscience, which, if we will, Socrates has taught
us to use rightly. That voice still enjoins us to give to ourselves a
reason for the hope that is in us,- both hearing and asking questions.
It tells us, that the fancied repose which self-inquiry disturbs is more
than compensated by the real repose which it gives; that a wise questioning is the half of knowledge; and that a life without self-examination is no life at all.

In Iteason's light. -Not oft she visits earth,
But her majestic port, the willing mind,
Through Faith, may sometimes see. Give her thy soul,
Nor faint, though Error's surges loudly'gainst thee roll
Be free - not chiefly from the iron chain,
But from the one which Passion forges -be
The master of thyself.  If lost, regain
The rule o'er chance, sense, circumstance.  Be free.
Trample thy proud lusts proudly'neath thy feet,
And stand erect, as for a heaven-born one is meet.
Seek Virtue. Wear her armor to the fight;
Then, as a wrestler gathers strength from strife,
Shalt thou be nerved to a more vigorous might
By each contending, turbulent ill of life.
Seek Virtue. - She alone is all divine;
And having found, be strong, in God's own strength and thile.
Truth - Freedom - Virtue - these, dear child, have power,
If rightly cherished, to uphold, sustain,
And bless thy spirit, in its darkest hour;
Neglect them - thy celestial gifts are vainIn dust shall thy weak wing be dragged and soiled;
Thy soul be crushed'neath gauds for which it basely toiled
38. AMIERICA'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WORLD.- Gulian C. Verpyanck.
WVHAT, it is asked, has this Nation done to repay the world for the
benefits we have received from others? -Is it nothing for the universal good of mankind to have carried into successful operation a
system of self-government,-uniting personal liberty, freedom of opinion, and equality of rights, with national power and dignity, - such as
had before existed only' in the Utopian dreams of philosophers? Is it
nothing, in moral science, to have anticipated, in sober reality, numerous plans of reform in civil and criminal jurisprudence, which are,
but now received as plausible theories by the politicians and economists of Europe?   Is it nothing to have been able to call forth, on
every emergency, either in war or peace, a body of talents always
equal to tlhe difficulty?  Is it nothing to have, in less than half a
ecentury, exceedingly improved the sciences of political ecc-omy, of
law, and of medicine, with all their auxiliary branches; to have
enriched human knowledge by the accumulation of a great mass of
useful facts and observations, and to have augmente4 the power and
the comforts of civilized man by miracles of mechanical invention?
Is it nothing to have given the world examples of disinterested patriotisrn, of political wisdom, of public virtue; of learning, eloquence
and vator, never exerted save for some praiseworthy end?   It isM')RAL AND DLI ACTIC. - ROUSSEAU.
sufficient to have briefly suggested these considerations; every mind
would anticipate me in filling up the details.
No, Land of Liberty! -thy children have no cause to blush for
thee.  What, though the arts have reared few monuments among
us, and scarce a trace of the Mluse's footstep is found in the paths of
ouir forests, or along the banks of our rivers,- yet our soil has been
consecrated by the blood of heroes, and by great and holy deeds of
peace.  Its wide extent has become one vast temple, and hallowed
asylum, sanctified. by the prayers and blessings of the persecuted of
every sect, and the wretched of all Nations.  Land of Refuge, -
Land of Benedictions! -Those prayers still arise, and they still are
heard: "MlIay peace be within thy walls, and plenteousness within thy
palaces! "    " vay there be no decay, no leading into captivity, and no
complaining, in thy streets!"  "lMay truth flourish out of the earth,
and righteousness look down from Heaven!"
39. THE TRUE KING.- Translated from Seneca, by Leigh Hunt.'TIS not wealth that makes a King,
Nor the purple coloring;
Nor a brow that's bound with gold,
Nor gate on mighty hinges rolled.
The King is bt, who, void of fear,
Looks abroad with bosom clear;
WVho can tread ambition down,
Nor be swayed by smile or frown;
Nor for all the treasure cares,
That mine conceals, or harvest wears,
Or that golden sands deliver,
Bosomed in a glassy river.
What shall move his placid might?
Not the headlong thunder-light,
Nor all the shapes of slaughter's trade,
With onward lance, or fiery blade.
Safe, with wisdom for his crown,
He looks on all things calmly down;
I-Ie welcomes Fate, when Fate is near
Nor taints his dying breath with fear.
No - to fear not earthly tling,
l'Iis it is that makes the King;
And all of u,s, whoe'er we be
May carve us out that royalty.
iO DEATHR S COMPENSATION. -Original Trans. from Rousseau. B. 1712; d. 177.t

more I consult my own intelligence, - the more legibly do I find writ.
69TIIE STANDARID SPEAKER.
ten in mny sou these words, -BE.1UST, AND THOU SHALT BE EAPPvY!
But let us not base our expectations upon the present state of thinD.
The wicke, d prosper, and the just reImain oppressed.  At this frustration of our hopes, our indignation is kindled.  Conscienee takes
umbrage, and murmurs against its Author' it murmurs, ";7wou hast

rnot thy noble life by turning thine own hand against it.  Leave not
thy hope and thy glory with thy mortal body on the field of Philippi.
Why dost thou say, virtue is nothing, when thou goest to enjoy thL
price of thine?  Thou goest to die, thou thinkest; no, thou goest to
live, and it is then that I shall fulfil all that I have promised thee."
One would say, from the murmurs of impatient mortals, that God
owed them recompense before merit, and that He ought to requite
their virtue in advance. 0! let us first be good, and afterwards we
shall be happy. Let us not exact the prize before the victory, nor the
wages before the labor. It is not on the course, says Plutarch, that
the conquerors in our games are crowned; it is after they have gone
cver it. If the soul is immaterial, it can survive the body; and, in
that survival, Providence is justified. Though I were to have no
other proof of the immateriality of the soul than the triumph of the
wicked and the oppression of the just in this world, that spectacle
alone would prevent my doubting the reality of the life after death.
So shocking a dissonance in this universal harmony would make me
seek to explain it.  I should say to myself: "All does not firfish for
me with this mortal life; what succeeds shall make concord of what
-Fent before."

How just his hopes, let Swedish Charles decide'
A frame of adamant, a soul of fire,
No dangers fright him, and no labors tire;
O'er love, o'er fear, extends his wide domain,
Unconquered lord of pleasure and of pain;
No joys to him pacific sceptres yield,
War sounds the trump, he rushes to the field,
Behold surrounding Kings their powers combine,
And one capitulate, and one resign;
Peace courts his hand, but,reads her charms in vain,

42. OUR DUTIES TO THE REPUBLIC.--Judge Story. Born, 1779; died, 1846
Tnr~ Old World has already revealed to us, in its unsealed books, the
beginning and end of all its own marvellous struggles in the cause of
liberty. Greece, lovely Greece,
" The land of scholars and the nurse of arms,"
where Sister Republics, in fair procession, chanted the praises of liberty and the Gods, --where and what is she?  For two thousand
years the oppressor has ground her to the earth. Ier arts are no
more. The last sad relics of her temples are but the barracks of a
ruthless soldiery. The fragments of her columns and her palaces are
in the dust, yet beautiful in ruins. She fell not when the mighty
were upon her. Her sons were united at Thermopylse and Marathon;
and the tide of her triumph rolled back upon the Hellespont.  She
was conquered by her own factions. She fell by the hands of her
own People. The man of Macedonia did not the work of destruction.
It was already done, by her own corruptions, banishments, and dissensions. Rome, republican Rome, whose eagles glanced in the rising
and setting sun, -where and what is she? The eternal city yet
remains, proud even in her desolation, noble in her decline, venerable
in the majesty of religion, and calm as in the composure of death.
The malaria has but travelled in the paths worn by her destroyers.
Mlore than eighteen centuries have mourned over the loss of her
empire. A mortal disease was upon her vitals before Csesar had
crossed the Rubicon; and Brutus did not restore her health by the
deep probings of the Senate-chamber. The Goths, and Vandals,
and Iuns, the swarms of the North, completed only what was already
begun at home. Romans betrayed Rome. The Legions were bought
and sold; but the People offered the tribute money.
We stand the latest, and, if we fail, probably the last experiment
of self-government by the People.  We have begun it under circunm72

stances of the most auspicious nature.  We are in the vigor eo
youth.  Our growth has never been checked by the oppressions of
tyranny.  Our constitutions have never been enfeebled by the vices
or luxuries of the Old World. Such as we are, we have been from the
beginning, - simple, hardy, intelligent, accustomed to self-government,
and to self-respect.  The Atlantic rolls between us and any formil
dable foe. Within our own territory, stretching through many degrees
of latitude and longitude, we have the choice of many products, and
many means of independence.  The Government is mild. The Press
ks free.  Religion is free.  Knowledge reaches, or may reach, every
home. What fairer prospect of success could be presented? What
means more adequate to accomplish the sublime end?  What more is
necessary than for the People to preserve what they have themselves
created?  Already has the age caught the spirit of our institutions.
It has already ascended the Andes, and snuffed the breezes of both
oceans. It has infused itself into the life-blood of Europe, and warmed
the sunny plains of France and the low lands of Holland.  It has
touched the philosophy of Germany and the North; and, moving
onward to the South, has opened to Greece the lessons of her better days.  Can it be that America, under such circumstances, can
betray herself?  Can it be that she is to be added to the catalogue
of Republics, the inscription upon whose ruins is: THEY WERE, BUT
ThEY ARE NOT?  Forbid it, my countrymen! Forbid it, IHeaven!

Beloved by Heaven o'er all the world beside;
Where brighter suns dispense serener light,
And milder moons emparadise the night;There is a spot of earth supremely blest,

His cavern-shelter, and his cottage-home.

Looks down in scorn upon the Summner zone;

On pure Madeira's vine-robed hills of health;
In Java's swamps of pestilence and wealth;
Where Babel stood, where wolves and jackals drink'Midst weeping willows, on Euphrates' brink;
On Carmel's crest; by Jordan's reverend stream,
Where Canaan's glories vanished like a dream;
Where Greece, a spectre, haunts her heroes' graves,
And Ronze's vast ruins darken Tiber's waves;
Where broken-hearted Switzerland bewails
Her subject mountains and dishonored vales;
Where Albicn's rocks exult amidst the sea,
Around the beauteous isle of Liberty;Man, through all ages of revolving time,

44. NATURE A IIARD CPEDITOR..-Thonas Carlyle.
NATURE admits no lie.  Most men profess to be aware of this, bur
few in any measure lay it to heart.  Except in the departments of
mere material manipulation, it seems to be taken practically as if this
grand truth were merely a polite flourish of rhetoric.  Nature keeps
silently a most exact Savings-bank and official register, correct to the
most evanescent item, Debtor and Creditor, in respect to one and all
of us; silently marks down, Creditor by such and such an unseen act
of veracity and heroism; Debtor to such a loud, blustery blunder,
twventy-seven million strong or one unit strong, and to all acts and
words and thoughts executed in consequence of that, - Debtor, Debtor,
Debtor, day after day, rigoroutsly as Fate (for this is Fate that is writ.

with the due rate of interest you will have to pay it, neatly, completely,
as sure as you are alive.  You will have to pay it even in money, if
you live: and, poor slave, do you think there is no payment but i
money? There is a payment which Nature rigorously exacts of men
ancl also of Nations, - and this I think when her wrath is sternest. -
in the shape of dooming you to possess money:-to possess it; to have
youlr bloated vanities fostered into monstrosity by it; your foul passions
blown into explosion by it; your heart, and, perhaps, your very stomach,
ruined with intoxication by it; your poor life, and all its manful activities, stunned into frenzy and comatose sleep by it; - in one word, as
the old Prophets said, your soul forever lost by it: your soul, so tlhat,
through the Eternities, you shall have no soul, or manful trace of eyer
having had a soul; but only, for certain fleeting moments, shall have
had a money-bag, and have given soul and heart, and (frightfuller still)
stomach itself, in fatal exchange for the same. You wretched mortal,
stumbling about in a God's Temple, and thinking it a brutal Cookeryshop!   Nature, when her scorn of a slave is divinest, and blazes like
the blinding lightning against his slavehood, often enough flings him a
bag of money, silently saying: "That! Away; thy doom is that!'

Of life stoci still, and Nature made a pause,
An awful pause' prophetic of her end.

47. THE TRUE SOURCE OF REFORMI. - Rev. E. H. Chapzn.
TI1i:  g cat element of Reform is not born of human wisdom, it does,lot drawv its life from human organizations.  I find it only in CHRIS21ANITI.  "Thy kingdom come!"     There i. a sublime and pregnant
ourden in this Prayer.  It is the aspiration of every soul that goes
torth in the spirit of RIeforimr.  For what is the significance of this
Prayer?  It is a petition that all holy influences would penetrate and
subdue and dwell in the heart of man, until he shall think, and speak,
and do good, from  the very necessity of his being.  So woulcd the
institutions'of error and wrong cruIible and pass away.  So would sin
die out from the earth; and the human soul living in harmony with
the Divine Will, this earth would become like Heaven.  It is too late
for the Reformers to sneer at Chlristianity, - it is fobolishness for them
to reject it. In it are enshrined our faith in human progress,- our
confidence in lReform.  It is indissolubly connected with all that is
hopefi~, spiritual, capable, in man. That men have nmisunderstood it,
and perverted;t, is true.  But it is also true that the noblest efforts,
for human melioration have come out of it, - have been based upon it.
Is it not so?  Come, ye remembered onas, who sleep the sleep of the
Just, -  who toolk your conduct fi'om the line of Christian Philosophy,
- come from your tombs, and answer!
Come, lHoward, from the gloolm of thle prison and the taint of the
lazar-house, and show us what Philanthropy can do when imbued with
the spirit of Jesus.  Come, Eliot, from the thick forest where the red
man listens to the Word of Life; - come, Penn, firom thy sweet coint;el and weaponless victory, -- and show us what Christian Zeal and
Christiani Love can accomplish with the rudest barbarians or the fiercest
hearts.  Come, Raikes, from thy labors with the ignorant and the
poor, and show us with what an eye this Faith regards the lowest and
leaist of our race; and how diligently it labors, not for the body, not for
the rank, but for the plastic soul that is to course the ages of immort:lity.  And ye, who are a great number, --ye nameless ones, - who
have done good in your narrow spheres, contel,; to forego renlown onMORAL AND DIDACTIC. - MACKAY.
)arth, and seeking your Reward in the Record on High,- come and tell
as how kindly a spirit, how lofty a purpose, or how strong a courage
the Religion ye professed can breathe into the poor, the humble, and
the weak. Go forth, then, Spirit of Christianity, to thy great work
of REFORM! The Past bears witness to thee in the blood of thv mar
tyrs, and the ashes of thy saints and heroes; the Present is hopefui
t,c,ause of thee; the Future shall acknowledge thy omnipotence.
t8. TI-IHE BEACON LIGIIT.-- Miss Pardoe.
DARFNECS was deepenin'g o'er the seas, and still the hulk drove on
No sail to answer to the breeze, - her masts and cordage gone;
Gloomy and drear her course of fear, - each looked but for. a grave,--
When, full in sight, the beacon light came streaming o'er the wave.
Then wildly rose the gladdening shout of all that hardy crew;
Boldly they put the helm about, and through the surf they flew.
Storm was forgot, toil heeded not, and loud the cheer they gave,
As, full in sight, the beacon light came streaming o'er the wave.
And gayly of the tale they told, when they were safe on shore;
How hearts had sunk and hopes grown cold amid the billow's roar;
When not a star had shone from far, by its pale beam to save;
then, full in sight, the beacon light came streaming o'er the wave.
Thus, in the night of nature's gloom, when sorrow bows, the heart,When cheering hopes no more illume, and prospects all depart,
Then, from afar, shines Bethleaem's star, with cheering light to sace,
And, full in sight, its beacon light comes streaming o'er the grave.
49. "CLEON AND I." - Charles MIackay.
CLEON hath a million acres, - ne'er a one have I;
Cleon dwelletlb in a palace,- in a cottage, I;
Cleon hath a dozen fortunes, - not a penny, I;
But the poorer of the twain is Cleon, and not I.
Cleon, true, possesseth acres,--but the landscape, I;
Half the charms to me it yieldeth money cannot buy;
Cleon harbors sloth and dulness, - freshening vigor, I;
ITe in velvet, I in fustian,  richer man am I.
Cleon is a slave to grandeur, - free as thought am I;
Cleon fees a score of doctors, - need of none have I.
W\ealth-surrounded care-environed, Cleon fears to die;
Death may come, - he'11 find me ready, - happier man am L
Cleon sees no charms in Nature, - in a daisy, I;
Cleon hears no anthems ringing in the sea and sky.
Nature sings to me forever, - earnest listener I;
State for state, with all attendants, who would change? Not I

VITHE STANDARD SPEAKER.
50. TEIE PROBLEMI FOR THE UNITED STATES.- Rev. Henry A. Boardmane.
Tins Union cannot expire as the snow melts from. the rock, or a sta
ilsappears from the firmament.  When it falls, the crash will be heard
in all lands.  Wherever the winds of Heaven go, that will go, bearing sorrow and dismay to millions of stricken hearts; for the subver.
sion of this Government will render the cause of Constitutional Liberty
hopeless throughout the world.  What Nation can govern itself, if thi'
Nation cannot?   A4What encouragement will any People have to establish liberal institutions for thenlselves, if ours fail?  Providencse has
laid upon us the responsibility and the honor of solving:that probleL
iln which all coming generations of men have a profound interest,whether the true ends of Government can be secured by a popular
representative system.  In the munificence of Iis goodness, Ile put
us in possession of our heritage, by a series of interpositions scarcely
tess signal thanl those which conducted the HI-ebrews to C(anaan; and.Ie has, up to this periocl, withheld from us no immunities or resources
which might fiacilitate an auspicious result.  Never before was a People so advantageously situated for working out this great problem in
favor of human liberty; and it is important for us to understand that
the world so regards it.
If, in the frenzy of our'base sectional jealousies, we dig the grave
of the Union, and thus decide this question in the negative, no tongue
may attempt to depict the disappointment and despair which will go
along with the announcement, as it spreads through distant lands.  It
will be America, after. fifty years' experience, giving' in her adhesion
to the doctrine that man was not made for self-government.  It will
be Freedom herself proclaiming that Freedom is a chimera; Liberty
ringing her own knell, all over the globe.  And, when the citizens or
subjects of the Governments which are to succeed this Union shall
visit Europe, and see, in some land now struggling to cast off its fetters, the lacerated and lifeless form of Liberty laid prostrate under
the iron heel of Despotism, let them remember that the blow which
destroyecl her was inflicted by their own country.
"So the struck Eaigle, stretched upon the plain,
NTo more through rolling clouds to soar again,
Viewed his own feather on the fatal dart,
And winged the shaft that quivered in his heart.
Keen were his pangs, but keener far to feel
HIe nursed the pinion which impelled the steel;
While the same plumage that had warmed his nest
Drank the last life-drop of his bleeding breast."
51. TIHE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT OF SELF-GOVERNMIENT. Edwvard Everett.
WE are summoned to new energy and zeal by the high nature of
the experiment we are appointed in Providence to Ilake, and the
grandeur of the theatre on which it is to be performed. At a moment
of deep and general agitation in the Old World, it pleased Heaven to
open this last refiuze of humanitv.  "`'e atempt has`qpeg   and isMORHAL AND DIDACTIC. - LUNTo
going on, lar from foreign corruption, on the broadest scale, and under
the most benignant prospects; and it certainly rests with us to salve
the great problem in human society, - to settle, aild that forever, the
momentous question, - whether mankind can be trusted with a purel3
popular system of Government.
One might.almost think, without extravagance, that the departed
wise and good, of all places and times, are looking down from tlheir
happy seats to witness what shall now be lone ~b us  that they who
lavished their treasures and their blood, of old,-- who spake and wrote,
who labored, fought and perished, in the one great cause of Freedom
and Truth,- are now hanging, from their orbs on high, over the last
solemn experiment of humanlity.  As I have wandered over the spots
once the scene of their labors, and mused among the prostrate columns
of their senate-houses and forums, I have seemed almost to hear a
voice from the tombs of departed ages, from the sepulchres of the
Nations which died before the sight. They exhort us, they adjure us,
to be faithful to our trust.  They implore us, by the long trials of
strug,ling humanity;. by the blessed memory of the departed; by the
dear faith which has been plighted by pure hands to the holy cause
of truth and man; by the awful secrets of the prison-house, where the
sons of freedom have been immured; by the noble heads which have
been brought to the block; by the wrecks of time, by the eloquent
ruins of Nations, - they conjure us not to quench the light which is
rising on the world. Greece cries to us by the convulsed lips ofi her
poisoned, dying Demosthenes; and Rome pleads with as in the mute
persuasion of her mangled Tully.
52. THE SHIP OF STATE.- Rev. Wim. P. Lunt.
BREAr up the Union of these States, because there are acknowledged
evils in our system? Is it so easy a matter, then, to make everything
in the actual world conform exactly to the ideal pattern we have conceived, in our minds, of absolute right?  Suppose the fatal blow were
struck, and the bonds which fasten together these States were severed,
would the evils and mischiefs that would be experienced by those who
are actually members of this vast Republican Community be all that
would ensue?  Certainly not. We are connected with the several
Nations and Races of thr world as no other People has ever been connected.  We have opened our doors, and invited emigration to our
soil from all lands.  Our invitation has been accepted.  Thousands
have come at our bidding. Thousands more are on the way. Other
fthor.sands still are standing a-tiptoe on the shores of the Old Worl.d,
eager to find a passage to the land where bread may be had for labeor,
and where man is treated as man. In our political family almost all
Natidns are represented.  The several varieties of the race are here
subjected to a social fusion, out of which Providence designs to form
a 4 "new man."
We are iv this way teaching the world a great lesson,- namelyTHE STANSDARD SPEAKER.
that men of dfferent ianguages, habits, manners and creeds, can livs
together, and vote together, and, if not pray and worship together, yet
in near vicinity, and do all in peace, and be, for certain purposes at
least, one People.  And is not this lesson of some value to the world,
especially if we can teach it not by theory merely, but through a successfuil example?  Has not this lesson, thus conveyed, some connection with the world's progress towards that far-off period to which the
human mind looks for the fulfilment of its vision of a perfect social
stnte?  It may safely be asserted that this Union could not be dissolved without disarranging and convulsing every part of the globe.
iN t in the indulgence of a vain confidence did our fathers build the
Ship of State, and launch it upon the waters. WVe will exclaim, in the
noble words of one of our poets: *
"Thou, too, sail on, 0 Ship of State!
Sail on, 0 Union, strong and great!
itumanity with all its fears,
With all the hopes of future years,
Is hanging breathless on thy fate!
We know what Master laid thy keel,
What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,
Who made eacb mast, and sail, and rope,
5What anvils rang, what hammers beat,
In what a forge and what a heat
Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!
Fear not each sudden sound and shock,-'T is of the wave and not the rock;'T is but the flapping of tile sail,
And not a rent r-made by the gale!
In spite of rock and tempest roar,
In spite of false lights on the shore,
Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!
Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee.
Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,
Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,
Are all with thee,- are all with thee!"
53. ART. - Charles Sprague.
WHEN, from the sacred garden driven,
BIan fled before his lIaker's wrath,
An angel left her place in Heaven,
And crossed the wanderer's sunless path.'T was Art! sweet Art! New radiance broke
Where her light foot flew o'er the ground;
And thus with seraph voice she spoke, -
"The curse a blessing shall be found."
She l.ed him through the trackless wild,
WVhere noontide sunbeam never blazed;
The thistle shrank, the harvest smiled,
And Nature gladdened as she gazed.
IF H. IV. Longfellow.MORAL AND DIDACTIC. - BAYLvF.
Earth's thousand tribes of living things,
At Art's command, to him are given,
The village grows, the city springs,
And point their spires of faith to Heaveu.
He rends the oak, and bids it ride,
To guard the shores its beauty graced;
He smites the rock, - upheaved in pride,
See towers of strenlgth and domes of taste;
Earth's teeming caves their wealth reveal,
Fire bears his banner on the wave,
He bids the mortal poison heal,
And leaps triumphant o'er the grave.
He plucks the pearls that stud the deep,
Admiring Beauty's lap to fill;
He breaks the stubborn marble's sleep,
And mocks his own Creator's skill.
With thoughts that fill his glowing soul,
He bids the ore illume the page,
And, proudly scorning Time's control,
Commerces with an unborn age.
In fields of air he writes his name,
And treads the chambers of the sky,
He reads the stars, and grasps the flame
That quivers round the Throne on high
In war renowned, in peace sublime,
He moves in greatness and in grace;
His power, subduing space and time,
Links realm to realm, and race to race.
54. THE PILOT. - Thomas Haynes Bayly. Born, 1797; died, 1839
0, PILOT t't is a feartfl night, - there's danger on the deep;
I'11 come and pace the deck with thee,- I do not dare to sleep,
Go down! the sailor cried, go down; this is no place for thee:
Fear not; but trust in Providence, wherever thou mayst be
Ah! pilot, dangers often met we all are apt to slight,
Xnd thtou hast known these raging waves but to subdue their might
It is not apathy, he cried, that gives this strength to me:
Fo,ar not but trust in Providence, wherever thou mayst be.
On such a night the sea engualfed my father's lifeless form;
My only brother's boat went down in just so wild a storm -
And such, perhaps, may be my fate; but still I say to thee,
Fear not; Itt trust in Providence, wherever thou mayst be.

And reigns tremendous o'er the conquered year.
How dead the vegetable kingdom lies!
How duli b the tuneful! Horror wide extends
His desolate domain. Behold, fond man!
See here thy pictured life:- pass some few years,
Thy flowering Spring, thy Summer's ardent strength,
Thy sober Autumn fading into age,
And pale concluding Winter comes, at last,
And shuts the scene. Ah! whither now are fled
Those dreams of greatness? those unsolid hopes
Of happiness? those longings after fame?
Those restless cares? those busy bustling days?
Those gay-spent, festive nights? those veering thoughts
Lost between good and ill, that shared thy life?
All now are vanished! VIRYiTE sole survives,
Immortal, never-failing friend of man,

In every heightened form, from pain and death
Forever free. The great eternal scheme

Ye vainly wise! ye blind presumptuous! now,
Confounded in the dust, adore that POWER
And WISDOM oft arraigned: see now the cause,
Why unassuming Worth in secret lived,
And died neglected: why the good man's share
In life was gall and bitterness of soul:
Why the lone widow and her orphans pined,
In starving solitude; while Luxury,
In palaces, lay straining her low thoughlt,
To form unreal wants: why Heaven-born Truth.
And Moderation fair, wore the red marks
Of Superstition's scourge: why licensed Pain
That cruel spoiler, that embosomed foe,
Embittered all our bliss. Ye good distressed,
Ye noble few! who here unbending stand
Beneath life's pressure, yet bear up a while,
And what your bounded view, which only saw

56. INDUCEME,NTS TO EARNESTNESS IN RELIGION. --John Alngell Jame..
INDUCEMENTS!  Can it be necessary to offer these? What! Is
not: the bare mention of religion enough to rouse every soul, who
understands the meaning of that momentous word, to the greatest
intensity of action?  Who needs to have spread out before him tae
demonstrations of logic, or the persuasions of rhetoric, to move him to
neek after wealth, rank, or honor? Who, when an opportunity proe
sents itself to obtain such possessions, requires anything more than an
appeal to his consciousness of their value to engage him in the pursuit?
The very mention of riches suggests at once to man's cupidity a thousand arguments to use the means of obtaining them. What intense longings rise in the heart! What pictures crowd the imagination! lWhat
a spell comes over the whole soul! And why is there less, - yea,
why is there not intensely more, than all this, at the mention of the
word religion, - that term wlich comprehends Heaven and earth,
time and eternity, God and man, within its sublime and boundless
meaning?   If we were as we ought to be, it would be enough only to
whisper in the ear that word, of more than magic power, to engage
all our faculties, and all their energies, in the most resolute purpose,
the most determined pursuit, and the most entire self-devotement.
Inducements to earnestness in religion! Alas! how low we have
sunk, how far have we been paralyzed, to need to be thus stimulated!
Is religion a contradiction to the usual maxim, that a man's activity
in endeavoring to obtain an object is, if he understand it, in exact proportion to the value and importance which he attaches to it?  Are
Heaven, and salvation, and eternity, the only matters that shall reverse
this maxim, and make lukewarmness the rule of action? By what
thunder shall I break in upon your deep and dangerous sleep? 0,
revolve often and deeply the infinite realities of religion! Most subjects may be made to appear with greater or less dignity, according to
the greater or less degree of importance in which the preacher places
them. Pompous expressions, bold figures, lively ornaments of eloquence, may often supply a want of this dignity in the subject discussed. But every attempt to give importance to a motive taken from
eternity is more likely to enfeeble the doctrine than to invigorate'it.
Motives of this kind are seif-suffiieient.  Descriptions the most simple
and the most natural are always the most pathetic or the most terrifying; nor can I find an expression more powerful and emphatic than
that t(f Paul, "The things which are not seen are eternal."  What
more could the tongues of men and the eloquence of angels say'Etei al things"!  Weigh the import of that phrase, "eternal
things." The history of Nations, the eras of time, the, creation of
worlds, all fade into insignificance, - dwindle to a point, attenuate te
a shadow, - compared with these " eternal things."  Do you believe
them? If not, abjure your creed, abandon your belief. Be consistent,
and let the stupendous vision which, like Jacob's ladder, rests its fooeTHE STANDARD SPEAKER.
on earth and places its top in Ieaven, vanish in thin air! But if you
do believe, say what ought to be the conduct of him who, to his own
conviction, stands with hell beneath him, Heaven above him, and eter.
nity before him.  By all the worth of the immortal soul, by all
the blessings of eternal salvation, by all the glories of the upper
world, by all the horrors of the bottomless pit, by all the ages
of eternity and by all the personal interest you'have in these inftoiJt
realities, I conjure you to be in earnest in personal religion!
57. NEVER DESPAIR.--SamuelLover.
O, NEvER despair! for our hopes, oftentime,
Spring swiftly, as flowers in some tropical clime,
WVhere the spot that was barren and scentless at night
Is blooming and ftagrant at morning's first light!
The mariner marks, when the tempest rings loud,
That the rainbow is brighter, the darker the cloud;
Then, up! up! - never despair!
The leaves which the sibyl presented of old,
Though lessened in number, were not worth less gold;
And though Fate steal our joys, do not think they're the best, -
The few she has spared may be worth all the rest.
Good fbrtune oft comes in adversity's form,
And the rainbow is brightest when darkest the storm;
Then, up! up! - never despair!
And when all creation was sunk in the flood,
Sublime o'er the deluge the patriarch stood!
Though destruction around him in thunder was hurled,
Undaunted he looked on the wreck of the world.!
For, high o'er the ruin, hung Hope's blessed form. -
The rainbow beamed bright through the gloom of tthe storm

THE blessings which the weak and poor can scatter
Have their own season.'T is a little thing
To give a cup of water; yet its draught
Of cool refreshment, drained by fevered lips,
May give a shock of pleasure to the frame
More exquisite than when nectarean juice
Renews the life of joy in happiest hours.
It is a little thing to speak a phrase
Of common comfort, which, by daily use,
Has almost lost its sense; yet on the ear
Of him who thought to die unmourned,'t will fall
84MORAL AND DIDACTIC. - BRYANT.
Like choicest music; fill the glazing eye
With gentle tears; relax the knotted hand
To know the bonds of fellowship again;
And shed on the departing soul a sense
More precious than the benison of friends
About the honored death-bed of the rich,
To him who else were lonely, - that another
Of the great family is near, and feels.
59. TIIE BATTLE-FIELD. - William Cullen Bryant
ONCE this soft turf, this rivulet's sands,
Were trampled by a hurrying crowd,
And fiery hearts and armed hands
Encountered in the battle-cloud.
Ah! never shall the land forget
How gushed the life-blood of her brave,
Gushed, warm with hope and valor yet,
Upon the soil they fought to save.
Now all is calm, and fresh, and still;
Alone the chirp of flitting bird,
And talk of children on the hill,
And bell of wandering kine, are heard.
No solemn host goes trailing by
The black-mouthed gun and staggering wain
Men start not at the battle-cry; -
O, be it never heard again!
Soon rested those who fought, - but thou,
Who minglest in the harder strifb
For truths which men receive not now,
Thy warfare only ends with life.
A friendless warfare! lingering long
Through weary day and weary year;
A wild and many-weaponed throng
Hang on thy front, and flank, and rear.
Yet nerve thy spirit to the proof,
And blench not at thy chosen lot!
The timid good may stand aloof,
The sage may frown, - yet faint thou not!
Nor heed the shaft too surely cast,
The hissing, stinging bolt of scorn,nuj'1THE STANDARD SPEAKE.,
For with tlhy side shall dwell, at last,
The victory of endurance born.
Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise again:
The eternal years of God are hers;
But Error, wounded, writhes with pain,
And dies among his worshippers.
Yea, though thou die upon the dust,
When those who helped thee flee in fear,--
Die fiall of hope and manly trust,
Like those who fell in battle here,Another hand thy sword shall wield,
Another hand the standard wave,
Till friom the trumpet's mouth is pealed
The blast of triumph o'er thy grave!
60. THE DIZZY ACTIVITIES OF TIIHE TIMES. -Edward Evereet.
WS need the spirit of'75 to guide us safely amid the dinzy activ
ities of the times. WVhile our own numbers are increasing in an
unexampled ratio, Europe is pouring in upon us her hundreds of
thousands annually, and new regions are added to our domain, which
we are obliged to count by degrees of latitude and longitude. In the
mean time, the most wonderful discoveries of art, and the most mysterious powvers of nature, combine to give an almost fearful increase to
the intensity of our existence. MlIachines of unexampled complication and ingenuity have been applied to the whole range of human
industry: we rush across the land and the sea by steam; we correspond by magnetism; we paint by the solar ray; we count the
beats of the electric clock at the distance of a thousand miles; we
annihilate time and distance; and, amidst all the new agencies of
communication and action, the omnipotent Press - the great engine
of modern progress, not superseded or impaired, but gathering new
power from~ all the arts -is daily clothing itself with louder thunders.
While we contemplate with admiration-- almost with awe --the
mighty influences which surround us, alnd which demand our co6peration and our guidance, let our hearts overflow with gratitude to the
patriots who have handed down to us this great inheritance. Let us
strive to furnish ourselves, from the storehouse of their example, with
the principles and virtues which will strengthen us for the performance of an honored part on this illustrious stage. Let pure patriotism add its bond to the bars of iron which are binding the continent;
together; and, as intelligence shoots with the electric spark from
ocean to ocean, let public spirit and love of country catch from heart
to heartI MORAL AND DIDACTIC. --SYDNEY SMITH.
61 THE GOOD GREAT MAN.--S. T. Coleridge. Born, 1770; died. 1538.
"How seldom, friend, a good great man inherits
I-Ionor and wealth, with all his worth and pains!
It seems a story from the world of spirits
When any man obtains that which he merits,
Or ainy merits that which he obtains."
For shame, my friend! - renounce this idle strain  
What wouldst thou have a good great man obtain?
Wealth, title, dignity, a golden chain,
Or heap of corses which his sword hath slain?
Goodness and greatness are not means, but ends.
Hath he not always treasures, always friends,
The good great man? Three treasures,--love, anc light
And calm thoughts, equable as infant's breath;
And three fast friends, more sure than day or night, -
Himself, his Maker, and the Angel Death.
62. TAXES THE PRICE OF GLORY.-Rev. Sydney Smith. Born, 1768; died, 1845.
JOHN BULL can inform Jonathan what are the inevitable consequences of being too fond of Glory:- TAXES! Taxes upon every
article which enters into the mouth, or covers the back, or is placed
under the foot; taxes upon everything which it is pleasant' to see,
hear, feel, smell, or taste; taxes upon warmth, light, and locomotion;
taxes on everything on earth, and the waters under the earth; on
everything that comes from abroad, or is grown at home; taxes on
the raw material; taxes on every fresh value that is added to it by
the industry of man; taxes on the sauce which pampers man's appetite, and the drug that restores him to health; on the ermine which
decorates the Judge, and the rope which hangs the criminal; on the
poor man's salt, and the rich man's spice; on the brass nails of the
coffin, and the ribbons of the bride;--at bed or board, couchant or
levant, we must pay.
The school-boy whips his taxed top; the beardless yduth manages
his taxed horse, with a taxed bridle, on a taxed road; -and the dying
Englishman, pouring his medicine, which has paid seven per cent., into
a spoon that has paid fifteen per cent., flings himself back upon his
chintz-bed, which has paid twenty-two per cent., makes his will on,n eight-pound stmp, and expires in the arms of an apothecary, who
has paid a license of a hundred pounds for the privilege of putting
him to death. His whole property is then immediately taxed from
two to ten per cent. Besides the probate, large fees.are demanded for
burying him in the chancel; his virtues are handed down to posterity
on taxed marble; and he is then gathered to his fathers, --to be taxed
no more.
In addition to all this, the habit of dealing with large sums will
make the Government avaricious and profuse; and the system itselfPa40. Battle of Ivry,... Maca lay, 143

63. THE PRESS.--Adaptation from Ebenezer Elliot. Born, 1781; died, 1849
GOD said - " Let there be light!"
Grim darkness felt His might,
And fled away:
Then startled seas and mountains cold
Shone forth, all bright in blue and gold,
And cried - "'T is day!'t is day!"
" Hail, holy light! " exclaimed
The thunderous cloud that flamed
O'er daisies white;
And lo! the rose, in crimson dressed,
Leaned sweetly on the lily's breast,
And, blushing, murmured-" Light  
Then was the skylark born;
Then rose the embattled corn;
Then floods of praise
Flowed o'er the sunny hills of noon;
And then, in stillest night, the moon
Poured forth her pensive rays.
Lo, Heaven's bright bow is glad  
Lo,. trees and flowers, all clad
In glory, bloom!
And shall the immortal sons of God
Be senseless as the trodden clod,
And darker than the tomb?
No, by the mind of man!
By the swart artisan!
We will aspire!
Our souls have holy light within,
And every form of grief and sin
Shall see and feel its fire.
By all we hope of Heaven,
The shroud of souls is riven

64. A DEFENCE OF POETRY.--Rev. Charles Wolfe. Born, 1791; died, 1823.
BELIEVE not those who tell you that Poetry will seduce the youth.,
ful mind from severe occupations. Didactic Poetry not only admits,
but requires, the cooperation of Philosophy and Science. And true
Poetry must be always reverent. Would not an universal cloud settle
upon all the beauties of Creation, if it.were supposed that they had
not emanated from Almighty energy? In works of art, we are not
content with the accuracy of feature, and the glow of coloring, until
we have traced them to the mind that guided the chisel, and gave the
pencil its delicacies and its animation. Nor -an we look with delight
on the features of Nature, without hailing the celestial Intelligence
that gave them birth. The Deity is too sublime for Poetry to doubt
His existence. Creation has too much of the Divinity insinuated into
her beauties to allow Poetry to hesitate in her creed. She demands
no proof.  She waits for no demonstration. She looks, and she
believes. She adnlires, and she adores. Nor is it alone with natural
religion that she maintains this intimate connection; for what is the
Christian's hope, but Poetry in her purest and most ethereal essence.
From the beginning she was' one of the ministering spirits that
stand round the Throne of God, to issue forth at His word, and do
His errands upon the earth.  Sometimes she has been the herald of
an offending nation's downfall. Often has she been sent commissioned
to offending man, with prophecy and warning upon her lips. At
other times she has been intrusted with "glad tidings of great joy.',
Poetry was the anticipating Apostle, the prophetic Evangelist, whose
feet " were beautiful upon the mpuntains;" who published salvation
wh) said unto Zion, " Thy God reigneth!".
65. GREAT IDEAS.--Rev. Wi. E. Channing.
WInAT is needed to elevate the soul is, not that a man should know
all that has been thought and written in regard to the spiritual nature,
not that a man should become an Encyclopedia, but that the Great
Ideas in which all discoveries terminate, which sum up all sciences
which the philosopher extracts from infinite details, rmay be comprehended and felt. It is not the quantity, but the quality of knowledge, which determ;nes the mind's dignity.  A man of immenmTHlE STANDARD SPEARER.
information may, through tXe want of large and comprehensive idea,
be far inferior in intellect to a laborer, who, with little knowledge, has
yet seized on great truths.  For example, I do not expect the laborer
to study theology in the ancient languages, in the writings of the
Fathers, in the history of sects; nor is this needful. All theology
scattered as it is through countless volumes, is summed up in the idea
of God; and let this idea shine bright and clear in the laborer's soul.
and he has the essence of theological libraries, and a far higher ligllht
than has visited thousands of renowned divines. A great mind is
formed by a few great ideas, not by an infinity of loose details.
I have known very learned men who seemed to me very poor in
intellect, because they had no grand thoughts. What avails it that a
man has studied ever so minutely the histories of G-reece and Ptome,
if the Great Ideas of Freedom, and Beauty, and Valor, and SpirituLal
Energy, have not been kindled, by those records, into living fires in
his soul? The illumination of an age does not consist in the amount
of its knowledge, but in the broad and noble principles of which that
knowledge is the foundation and inspirer. The truth is, that the most
laborious and successful student is confined in his researches to a very
few of God's works; but this limited knowledge of things may still
suggest universal laws, broad principles, grand ideas; and these elevate the mind. There are certain thoughts, principles, ideas, which
by their nature rule over all knowledge, which are intrinsically glorious, quick!ening, all-conxprehending, eternal!

WEAT's hallowed ground?  Has earth a clod

TaERE is a God!    The herbs of the valley, the cedars of the
mountain, bless Him; the insect sports in His beam; the bird sings
Himi in the foliage; the thunder proclaims Him in the Heavens,
the ocean declares His immensity; -- man alone has said, there is
no God!   Unite in thought at the saime instant the most beautiful objects in nature. Suppose that you see, at once, all the hours
of the day, and all the seasons of the year: a morning of spring,
and a morning of autumn; a night bespangled with stars, and a
night darkened by clouds; meadows enamelled with flowers; forests
hoary with snow; fields gilded by the tints of autumn, - then alone
you will have a just conception of the universe!  While you are
gazing on that sun which is plunging into the vault of the West,
allother observer admires him emerging from the gilded gates of
the East.  By what inconceivable power does that aged star, which is
sinking fatigued and burning in the shades of the evening, reaippear
at tbhe same instant fresh and humid with the rosy dew of the morninc? At every hour of the day, the glorious orb is at once rising,
resp?!ndent as nooin-day, and setting in the west; or, rather, our senses
de&gt;cive us, and there is, properly speaking, no East or West, no North
Dr South, in the world.
69. WHAT WE OWE TO THE SWORD.- T. S. Grimkc. Born, 1778; died, 1534.
To the question, " what have the People ever gained but by Revolution," I answer, boldly, If by Revolution be understood the law of
the Sword, Liberty has lost far more than she has ever gained by it
The S-word was the destroyer of the Lycian Confederacy and the
Ach=can league.  The Sword alternately enslaved and disenthralled
Thebes and Athenis, Sparta, Syracuse and Corinth. The Swordi of
Rome conquered every other fre, State, and finished the marder ofMORAL AND DIDACTIC. -- HLT
liberty in the ancient world, by destroying horself.  What but the
Sword, in modern times, annihilated the Republics of Italy, the HEanse.
atic towns, and the primitive independence of Ireland, Wales and
Scotland?  What but the Sword partitioned Poland, assassinated the
rising liberty of Spain, banished the Huguenots from France, and
made Cromwell tlhe master, not the servant, of the People? And what
but the Sword of Republican France destroyed the Independence of
hialf' of Europe, deluged the continent with tears, devoured its nlillions
upon millions, and closed the long catalogue of guilt, by founding and
defending to the last the most powerful, selfish, and insatiable of miilitary despotisms?
The Sword, indeed, delivered Greece from  the Persian invaders,
expelled the Tarquins from Rnome, emancipated Switzerland and Holland, restored the Bruce to his Throne, and brought Charles to the
scaffold. And the Sword redeemed the pledge of the Congress of'76, when they plighted to each other "their lives, their fortunes,
and their sacred honor."  And yet, what would the redemption of
that pledge have availed towards the establishment of our present
Government, if the spirit of American institutions had not been both
the birthright and the birth-blessing of the Colonies? The Indians,
the French, the Spaniards, and even England herself, warred in vain
against- a People, born and bred in the household, at the domestic
altar, of Liberty herself. They had never been slaves, for they were
born free. The Sword was a herald to proclaim their freedom, but it
neither created nor preserved it. A century and a half had already
beheld them free in infancy, free in youth, free in early manhood.
Theirs was already the spirit of American institutions; the spirit of.
Christian freedom, of a temperate, regulated freedom, of a rational
civil obedience. For such a People, the Sword, the law of violence,
did and could do nothing, but sever the bonds which bound her colonial wards to their unnatural guardian. They redeemed their pledge,
Sword in hand; but the Sword left them as it found them, unchanged in character, - fireemen in thought and in deed, instinct with
the immortal spirit of American institutions!
70. ABOU BEN ADHEM.-Leigh Hunt.
ABOU BEN ADIEMI (may his tribe increase!)
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,
And saw within the moonlight of his room,
Braking it rich, and like a lily in bloom,
An angel writing in a book of gold.
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,
And, to the presence in the room, he said,
" What writest thou? "  The vision raised its head,
And, with a look made of all sweet accord,
Answered,'The names of those who love the Lord!"TIIE STANDARD SPrEAKER.
"And is mine one?" asked Abol. -' Nay, not so,"
Replied the angel. Abou spake more low,
But cheerly still; and said-" I pray thee. then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow-men."
The angel wrote and vanished.  The next night
It came again, with a great wakening light,

And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest!
71 POLONIUS TO LAE RTES. - William Shakspeare. Born, 1564; died, 1616.
MY blessing with you!
And these few precepts in thy memory
Look thou charae'ter.  Give thy thoughts no tongiue,
NTor any unpropoitioned thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatched, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,
Bear it that the opposer may beware of thee.
G-ive every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
Take each man's e&amp;'nsure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
And they in France, of the best rank and station,
Are most select and generous chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and fi'iend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all, - to thine own self be truf.
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.

"Man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?"'AND where is he? "  Not by the side
Of her whose wants he loved to tend;
Not o'er those valleys wandering wide,
There, sweetly lost, he oft would wend.
That fornm beloved he marks no more;
Those scenes admired no more shlall see;
Those scenes are lovely as before, -
And she as f-ir, - but where is he?MORAL ANI DIDACTIC, - WAYLAND.
No, no! the radiance is not dim,
That used to gild his favorite hill'
The pleasures that were dear to him
Are dear to life and nature still
iBit, ah! his home is not as fair,
Neglected must his garden be;
The lilies droop and wither there
And seem to whisper, Where is he?
His was the pomp, the crowded hall
But where is now his proud display?
HIis riches, honors, pleasures, - all,
Desire could frame; but where are they.
And he, as some tall rock that stands,
Protected by the circling sea,
Surrounded by admiring bands,
Seemed proudly strong, - and where is he t
The church-yard bears an added stone;
The fire-side shows a vacant chair;
Here Sadness dwells, and weeps alone;
And Death displays his banner there!
The life has gone; the breathl has fled;
And what has been no more shall be;
The well-known form, the welcome tread, -
O! where are they?  Ayid where is he?
73. GROWTII OF INTERNATIONAL SYMPATHIES. --President Waylamd.
IN many respects, the Nations of Christendom collectively are
becoming somewhat analogous to our own Federal Republic. Antiquated distinctions are breaking away, and local animosities are subsiding. The common people of different countries are knowing each
other better, esteeming each other more, and attaching themselves to
each other by various manifestations of reciprocal good will.  It is
true, every nation has still its separate boundaries and its individual
interests; but the fi'ecdom of commercial intercourse is allowing those
interests to adjust themselves to each other, and thus rendering the
muses of collision of vastly less frequent occurrence. Local questiomus
are becoming of less, and general quLestions of greater importance.
Thanks be to God, men have at last begun to understand the rights
and feel for the wrongs of each other! Mountains interposed do not
so much make enemies of nations.   Let the trumpet of alarm be
sounded, and its notes are now heard by every nation, whether of
Europe or America.  Let a voice borne on the feeblest breeze tell
that the rights of man are in danger, and it floats over valley and
mounitain, across continent and ocean, until it has vibrated on the ear
of the remotest dweller in Christendom.  Let the arm of OppressionTHE STANDARD SPEAKER.
oe raised to crush the feeblest nation on earth, and there will be heard
everywhere, if not the shout of defiance, at least -the deep-toned nmur
mur of implacable displeasure. It is the cry of aggrieved, insulted,
mnuch-abused man. It is human nature waking in her might from the
slumber of ages, shaking herself from the dust of antiquated institutions, girding herself for the combat, and going forth conquering and
to conquer; and woe unto the man, woe unto the dynasty, woe unto
the party, and woe unto the policy, on whom shall fall the scathe of
her blighting indignation!
7-1 TIE WORTII OF FAME. -Joanna Baillie. Born, 1765; died, 1860.
O! wHo shall lightly say that Fame
Is nothing but an empty name,
Whilst in that sound there is a charm
The nerves to brace, the heart to warm,
As, thinking of the mighty dead,
The young from slothful couch will start,
And vow, with lifted hands outspread,
Like them to act a noble part!
O! who shall lightly say that Fame
Is nothing but an empty name,
When, but for those, - our mighty dead, -
All ages past, a blank would be,
Sunk in oblivion's murky bed, -
A desert bare, a shipless sea?
They are the distant objects seen, -
The lofty marks of what hath been.
O! who shall lightly say that Fame
Is nothing but an empty name,
When memory of the mighty dead
To earth-worn pilgrim's wistful eye
The brightest rays of cheering shed.
That point to immortality?
A twinkling speck, but fixed and bright,
To guide us through the dreary night,
Each hero shines, and lures the soul
To gain the distant, happy goal.
For is there one who, musing o'er the grave
Where lies interred the good, the wise, the brave,
Can poorly think, beneath the mouldering heap.
That noble being shall forever sleep?
No, saith the generous heart, and proudly swells,--

V5 THE PURSUIT OF FRIVOLOUS PLEASURES.-- Young
O, THE dark days of vanity! while here
low tasteless, and how terrible when gone!
Gone! they ne'er go; when past, they haunt us still
The spirit walks of every day deceased,
And smiles an angel, or a fury frowns.
Nor death nor life delights us. If time past
And tilne possest both pain us, what can please.
That which the Deity to please ordained,
TIME USED! The man who consecrates his hourE
By vigorous effort and an honest aim,
At once he draws the sting of life and death;
He walks with Nature, and her paths are peace.
Ye well arrayed! ye lilies of our land!
Ye lilies male! who neither toil nor spin
(As sister lilies might), if not so wise
As Solomon, more sumptuous to the sight!
Ye delicate! who nothing cain support,
Yourselves most insupportable! for whom
The winter rose must blow, the Sun put on
A brighter beam in Leo; silky-soft
Favonius breathe still softer, or be chid;
And other worlds send odors, sauce, and song,
And robes, and notions, framed in foreign looms,O ye Lorenzos of our age! who deem
One moment unamused a misery
Not made for feeble man; who call aloud
For every bauble drivelled o'er by sense
For rattles and conceits of every cast,
PFor change of follies and relays of joy,
To drag your patient through the tedious length
Of a short winter's day,- say, Sages, say!
Wit's oracles! say, dreamers of gay dreams!
How will ye weather AN ETERNAL NIGHT,
Where such expedients fail?
76. FORGIVE. -Bishop Heber. Born, 1783; died, 1826.
0 G;)D! mny sins are manifold; against my life they cry,
And all my guilty deeds foregone up to Thy temple fly.
WV'ilt thiu release my trembling soul, that to despair is driven?
"' Forgive! " a blessed voice replied, "and thou shalt be forgiven."
My foemen, Lord, are fierce and fell; they spurn me in their pride
They render evil for my good; my patience they deride;
Arise! my King! and be the proud in righteous ruin driven!" Forgive " the awful answer came, "as thou wouldst be forgiven'
