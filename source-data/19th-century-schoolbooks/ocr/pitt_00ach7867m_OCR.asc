GENERAL SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.

1. Follow the directions given in the “ Phonic Analy-
sis.”

2. As soon as the pupils master that Analysis, give
them practice in phonically analyzing portions of the
reading lessons.

3. Let the pupils learn thoroughly the “ Directions
and Explanations,” and give them repeated and careful
practice upon the “Exercises for Elocutionary Drill.”
One of the objects of this Drill is vocal culture.

4. Make a constant application of these “Directions
and Explanations ” to every selection read.

5. Look carefully over the “Questions” and “Re-
marks ” appended to the different selections, and see that
the pupils get a thorough appreciation of the meaning of
every thing they read.

6. Let all the Drill be ACCURATE. E The frequent repe-
tition of a wrong pronunciation or an improper intona-
tion only conﬁrms the power of a bad habit. ,

~ 7. Let all the Work be done with LIFE, ENERGY, and
ENTHUSIASM.

8. The TEACHER, in order to succeed, MUST HIMSELF

THQROUGHLY MASTER WHAT HE PROPOSES To TEACH.

the sunnier South? Who has not enjoyed the familiar song
of the Bluebird or the ﬁrst whistle of our Robin, when in
early March they come once more to tell us that winter has
gone and spring is coming? Who has not learned to love
the gentle little Chipping Sparrow, as he picks up the crumbs
at our feet? Or who has failed to admire the bright-colored
Baltimore Oriole, as he weaves his curiously-hanging nest
over our heads, so safe from snakes or prowling cats?

2. Among the many feathered visitors who come back to r

us in spring, to make their home among us during the few
months of summer, there is one bird——-not beautiful, for he
is dressed from head to tail in dark and somber slate-color ,-
not always seemingly amiable, for when he thinks you are
imposing upon him he will scold you in a very earnest man-
ner—who deserves to be a great favorite with all. He can
not fail to be one when you appreciate all his good qualities.
3. He is a beautiful singer, a wonderful mimic, a conﬁd-

ing and trusting companion when you treat him well, becomes ‘

very fond of your company if you deserve it, watches over
your fruit—trees, and kills the insects that would injure or de-
stroy them or their fruit. If now and then he does help him-
self to a nice strawberry, or claims as his share your earliest
cherry, be sure he has well earned them. Besides, he is
never selﬁsh or greedy. Ten to one he only takes them for
his dear little children. Let us then bid him take them, and
let us ever extend a warm and hearty welcome to the Cat-
bird.

4. Let us give our conﬁding, social little friend a wel-
come all the more cordial because he has the great misfor-
tune of a bad name. Because he is called a Cat-bird he is
not so popular as he should be. He is disliked by ignorant

people, who do not appreciate his good qualities. He is too

often persecuted by thoughtless boys and ungrateful men,
who, unmindful of the good he is ever doing in the world,
hate him for no good reason, are deaf to his varied song, and
heed not his affectionate disposition or his many social
Virtues.

5. The Cat-bird is found, in certain seasons, all over
North America, from Florida to Canada, and from the At-
lantic coast to the Territories of Utah and Washington. He

THE FOURTH READER. 101

makes his ﬁrst appearance in spring about the time the pear-
trees are in blossom, which, near Boston, varies from the
5th to the 15th of May. He leaves us in the early autumn,
towards the latter part of September.

6. From his first coming almost to his departure, he
makes the air about us vocal with his quaint and charmin.g
melodies. These are made all the more attractive to us by
being so amusingly interspersed with notes mimicked from
the songs of other birds. Whether natural or copied, the
song of the Cat—bird is always very varied, attractive, and
beautiful.

7. The Cat—bird is never long in ascertaining where he is
a welcome visitor, and there he at once makes himself per-

fectly at home. You may see him at all times, for he is ever

in motion. As soon as he satisﬁes himself that you are his
friend, he will approach you with a familiarity that is quite
irresistible. He seems toiwish to attract your attention by
his great variety of positions, attitudes, and musical efforts.
N o musical young lady was ever more ambitious of enter-
taining an audience, however small and select, than our slate-
colored songster. He will come down, in the excitement of
his musical ardor, to the lowest bough, within a few feet of
your head, and devote himself to your entertainment so long
as you honor him with your attention.

XXVI.-—THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.

1. A few years since a pair of Cat-birds ventured to make

‘ their home in our garden, where they secreted their nest in a

corner hidden by vines and low bushes. They were at first
shy and retiring. Later in the season, when they had be-
come better acquainted with the children, they built a second
nest nearer to the house, in a more open place, on the bough
of an apple—tree. Having no time to lose, it was constructed,
in haste, of the bleached leaves and stalks of weeds that had
been pulled and left to dry in the sun.

2. It was, of course, soon discovered, ‘and the busy move-

ments of the birds watched by the children with great de'

102 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

light, as the last ﬁnishing touches were given to the lining by
the mother-bird. It was about ten feet from the ground, and
the little folks could only reach it by means of a ladder.
When only the children visited it, the parent birds looked on
with no complaints, but apparent complacency, at the chil=
dren’s admiration of their new home. Though rough and
coarse on the outside, it was neatly and prettily lined with
ﬁne black roots.

3. If anyone else ventured too near, the birds would be _

nervous and restless, and show their uneasiness by their
harsh cry of P-a-y, p-cz-y ./ But soon this passed away. The
gentle and loving interest of the children, especially of little
Charlie, with his frequent contributions of food, seemed to be
appreciated. The birds became very tame and familiar, per-
mitting without complaint their frequent visits to their nest
even when their young were ready to ﬂy.

4. The next season our Cat-birds, to the great gratiﬁca-
tion of the younger portion of the family, built their ‘nest in
a running rose-bush, under one of the chamber—windolws. It
was completed and the eggs nearly hatched before the family
had moved to their summer quarters. The father-bird
seemed to welcome our coming with his best melodies, and
the mother showed her conﬁdence by her constant presence
on the nest, undisturbed by the opening of the window, or
by curious but kind and loving faces within a few inches of
her treasures. She soon ceased even to leave her nest when
Lucy or Charlie, or even their little cousins, ventured to take
a look at her.

5. The next season their nest was repaired, and again oc-
cupied by a brood of four young birds when the family re-
turned. It was interesting to watch the old birds feeding the
greedy little fellows, whowere just out of their shells. -Our
gentle, loving little Charlie—-two months later so mysteriously
recalled to the bosom of Him who had given him—delighted
to lean over the window-sill and watch the parent birds.

6. Their familiarity and conﬁdence in the little fellow
were quite as remarkable as his patient interest in their
movements. One day the parents were missing. What had
happened to them we never knew; but they were gone sev~
eral hours, and we feared they had been killed. The chil~

THE FOURTH READER. 103

dren were in great distress ; and at last, when the hot sun
had been pouring down on their unprotected little naked
bodies, and it was feared the birds would die, permission was
sought to feed them. '

7. A few worms were cut up and eagerly devoured ,by
the hungry little ﬂedglings, when, to the joy of all, the
mother—bird appeared. Such a rejoicing as there was on all
sides! The children in the house and the children in the
nest were equally delighted. The latter for a while kept up
an earnest, eager clattering with their mother, telling her—-
so Lucy insisted—-—the whole story of their distress, loneli-
ness, and hunger, and of the kind and loving little hands
that had fed them with so much care and such affectionate
interest.

8. Our little feathered family soon removed to the gar-
den, where they ‘carried with them their remembrance of
their friends in the house. They were tame and familiar;
and wherever the earth was dug over, they would come
around us with the fearlessness of little chickens, keeping
about our feet, perching on the hoe-handle when dropped
from our hand, and slipping quietly off when it was retaken.

9. But clouds gathered over the bright scene. The bright
little spirit, whose gentleness and loving purity and goodness
had won for him all hearts, in one short week passed from
the enjoyments of earth to a heavenly home ; and his sister,
spared to us, but still suffering from the same epidemic, came
back again the following spring, to ﬁnd that our Cat-birds
had for a third time reconstructed their nest, only to be de-

stroyed by a neighbor’s cat : and though the garden is ﬁlled _

with their descendants, none of them have equaled their

' parents in their conﬁding and trustful disposition. .
10. We have missed their welcome in May, when we have

revisited our country home; for no spaniel ever manifested
more joy to greet its master than our Cat-bird did on the last
spring he was with us. He would ﬂy back and forth, over-
head, alight on the ground, just a few steps in front, wher-
ever we moved, accompanying our steps, and evincing his

ii apparent desire to greet us by his outpouring of song and

antic movements.
11. The power of mimicry of the Cat-bird, though lim-

IO4 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

ited, is often very striking and entertaining. He is very far
from being the equal of the Mocking—bird. The more diffi-
cult notes he can not successfully copy, and ludicrously fails
when he tries. But the whistle of the common Quail, the
clucking of a hen calling her brood, the cries of young
chickens for their mother’s aid, the notes of the Pewee and
‘the refrain of the Towhee, he will repeat with perfect exact-
ness, so as even to deceive the birds themselves.

12. We were once crossing a swampy thicket, when the A

sound of ‘‘Bob-white ! ” so like the cry of a quail, caused a
useless search for that bird, which ended in our espying its
author in a Cat-bird snugly hid away, and apparently hugely
enjoying the cheat. At another time we have known the Cat-
bird call off a brood of young chickens, greatly to the an-
noyance of the old hen.

13. To its own family the Cat-bird is devoted and con-
stant in its care and attentions. To each other they are af-
fectionate, kind, and sympathizing in their troubles ,' and the
male bird, with a brood of its own has been known ’to bring
up another brood, not its own, that had been taken from their
mother’s nest and placed near that of its kind friend.

14. We hope we have said enough of the good qualities
of our favorite bird to teach our young folks to treat these

loving, conﬁding creatures with kindness, and to cultivate '

their good-will. They deserve your good-will, and they will
repay with their charming songs, and their equally charming
and affectionate conﬁdence, your kind treatment of them.

 

XXVII.—THE N UTCRACKERS OF N UTCRACKER,
LODGE.

HARRIET B. STOWE.

1. Mr.‘ and Mrs. Nutcracker were as respectable a pair
of squirrels as ever wore gray brushes over their backs.
They were animals of a settled and serious turn of
mind, not supposed to run after vanities and novelties, but
ﬁlling their station in life with prudence and sobriety. Nut-
cracker Lodge was a hole in a sturdy old chestnut, overhang-

THE FOURTH READER. 105

ing a shady dell, and was held to be as respectably kept an
establishment as there was in the whole forest.

2. Even Miss Jennie Wren, the greatest gossip of the
neighborhood, never found any thing to criticise in its arrange.
ments, and old Parson Too-whit, a venerable owl who in-
habited a branch somewhat more exalted, as became his pro-

fession, was in the habit of saving himself much trouble in

his parochial exhortations by telling his parishioners in short
to “look at the Nutcrackers” if they wanted to see what it
was to live a virtuous life. Every thing had gone on prosper-
ously with them, and they had reared many successive fami-
lies of young Nutcrackers, who went forth to assume their
places in the forest of life, and to reflect credit on their
bringing up,—so that naturally enough they began to have
a very easy way of considering themselves models of wis-
dom.

3. But at last it came along, in the course of events, that
they had a son named Featherhead, who was destined to
bring them a great deal of anxiety. Nobody knows what
the reason is, but the fact was, that Master F eatherhead was
as different from all‘ the former Children of this worthy
couple as if he had been dropped out of the moon into their
nest, instead of coming into it in the general way. Young

Featherhead was a squirrel of good parts and a lively dispo-

sition, but he was sulky and contrary and unreasonable, and
always ﬁnding matter of complaint in every thing his respecta-
ble papa and marnma did. '

4. Instead of assisting'in the cares of the family,—pick-
ing up nuts and learning other lessons proper to a young
squirrel,—-he seemed to settle himself from his earliest years
into a sort of lofty contempt for the Nutcrackers, for Nut-
cracker Lodge, and for all the good old ways and institutions
of the domestic hole, which he declared to be stupid and un-
reasonable, and entirely behind the times.

5. To be sure he was always on hand at meal-times, and
played a very lively tooth on the nuts which his mother had
collected, always selecting the very best for himself ; but he
seasoned his nibbling with so much grumbling and discon-
tent, and so many severe remarks, as to give the impression
that he considered himself a peculiarly ill-used squirrel in

having to “ eat their old grub,” as he very unceremoniously
called it. ’

6. Papa Nutcracker, on these occasions, was often ﬁercely
indignant, and poor little Mamma Nutcracker would shed
tears, and beg her darling to be a little more reasonable;
but the young gentleman seemed always to consider himself
as the injured party.

7. Now nobody could tell why A or wherefore Master

' F eatherhead looked upon himself as injured and aggrieved,

since he was living in a good hole, with plenty to eat, and
without the least care or labor of his own 3 but he seemed
rather to value himself upon being gloomy and dissatisﬁed.
While his parents and brothers and sisters were cheerfully
racing up and down the branches, busy in their domestic
toils, and laying up stores for the winter, F eatherhead sat
gloomily apart, declaring himself weary of existence, and feel-
ing himself at liberty to quarrel with every body and every
thing about him.

8. Nobody understood him, he said ,°——he was a squirrel
of a peculiar nature, and needed peculiar treatment, and no-
body treated him in a way that did not grate on the ﬁner
nerves of his feelings. He had higher notions of existence
than could be bounded by that old rotten hole in a hollow
tree 3 he had thoughts that soared far above the miserable,
petty details of every—day life, and he could’ not and would not
bring down these soaring aspirations to the contemptible
toil of laying up a few chestnuts or hickory-nuts for winter.

9. “ Depend upon it, my dear,” said Mrs. Nutcracker
solemnly, “that fellow must be a genius.”

“ F iddlestick on his genius!” said old Mr. Nutcracker;
“ what does he do? ”

“ 0 nothing, of course ; that’s one of the ﬁrst marks of
genius. Geniuses, you know, never can come down to com-
mon life.”

“ He eats enough for any two,” remarked old Nutcracker,

-“ and he never helps gather nuts.” N

10. “ My dear, ask Parson Too-whit; he has conversed
with him, and quite agrees with me that he says very uncom-
mon things for a squirrel of his age , he has such ﬁne feele
ings,——so much above those of the common crowd.”

THE FOURTH READER. 107

11. “ Fine feelings be hanged I” said old Nutcracker.
“When a fellow eats all the nuts that his mother gives him,
and then grumbles at her, I don’t believe much in his ﬁne feel-
ings. Why don’t he set himself about something? I’m go«
ing to tell my ﬁne young gentleman, that, if he doesn’t be
have himself, I’ll tumble him out of the nest, neck and crop,
and see if hunger won’t do something towards bringing down
his ﬁne airs.”

12. But then Mrs. Nutcracker fell on her husband’s neck
with both paws, and wept, and besought him so piteously to
have patience with her darling, that old Nutcracker, who was
himself a soft-hearted old squirrel, was prevailed upon to put
up with the airs and graces of his young scapegrace a little
longer, and secretly in his silly old heart he revolved the
question whether possibly it might not be that a great genius
was actually to come of his household.

13. The Nutcrackers belonged to the old established race
of the Grays, but they were sociable, friendly people, and
kept on the best of terms with all branches of the Nut-
cracker family. The Chipmunks of Chipmunk Hollow were
a very lively, cheerful, sociable race, and on the very best of
terms with the Nutcracker Grays. Young Tip Chipmunk,
the oldest son, was in all respects a perfect contrast, to Mas-

C ter Featherhead. He was always lively and cheerful, and so

Very alert in providing for the family, that old  and Mrs.
Chipmunk had very little care, but could sit sociably at the

door of their hole and chat with neighbors, quite sure that '

Tip would bring every thing out right for them, and have
plenty laid up for winter.

14. Now Featherhead took it upon him, for some reason
or other, to look down upon Tip Chipmunk, and on every
occasion to disparage him in the social circle, as a very com-
mon kind of squirrel, with whom it would be best not to
associate too freely.

“ My dear,” said Mrs. Nutcracker one day, when he was

expressing these ideas, “it seems to me that you are too hard
on poor Tip ;' he is a most excellent son and brother, and I
wish you would be civil to him.”

15. “ O, I don’t doubt that Tip is good enough,” said
Featherhead, carelessly ; “ but then he is so very common!

SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.
1. This drill must be t/wrong/z, or it will be Worth but

i little. THE TEACHER MUST MASTER THE ANALYSIS BEFORE

HE CAN TEACH IT. Let him be sure of this, at least,——that,
before calling upon a pupil to utter a given element, he is
prepared to u.tter it himself.

2. ALLOW NO FEEBLE WORK. In recitation, the pupil
should stand erect, have the lungs Well supplied With air,
and utter each element forcibly. Before, as Well as--after,
analyzing a Word, the pupil should pronounce it xvithriall
the clearness and precision he can command. If the Word
is other than a monosyllable, still more repetition is recom-

3. PHCNIC VVRITING is a valuable aid to both teacher

and pupil. At the end of each of several of the Lessons,’

is a list often or more Words, which the.pupil is expected

’ to write in neat letters, appropriately marked, when nec-

essary, as in the Phonic Chart, and present for the teach-
er’s inspection. The latter, by this thorough mode of
examination, is enabled to acquaint himself more fully
than he could by an oralexamination only, with the care
and progress of each member of the class.

he hasn’t an idea in his skull above his nuts and his hole.
He is good-natured enough, to be sure,——these very ordinary
people often are good-natured,—but he wants manner ; he
has really no manner at all ; and as to the deeper feelings,
Tip hasn’t the remotest idea of them. I mean always to be
civil to Tip when he comes in my way, but I think the less
we see of that sort of people the better ; and I hope, mother,
you won’t invite the Chipmunks at Christmas,—these family
dinners are such a bore 1 ”

16. “ But, my dear, your father thinks a great deal of the
Chipmunks ; and it is an old family custom to have all the
relatives here at Christmas.”

“ And an awful bore it is ! Why must people of reﬁne-
ment and elevation be forever tied down because of some dis-
tant relationship P Now there are our cousins the High-
F lyers,—if we could get them, there would be some sense in
it. Young Whisk rather promised me for Christmas 3 but
it’s seldom now you can get a ﬂying squirrel to show himself
in our parts, and if we are intimate with the Chipmunks it
isn’t to be expected.” _

17. “ Confound him for a puppy ! ” said old Nutcracker,
when his wife repeated these sayings to him. “ Featherhead
is a fool. Common, forsooth ! I wish good, industrious,
pains-taking sons like Tip Chipmunk were common. For
my part, I ﬁnd these uncommon people the most tiresome;
they are not content with letting us carry the whole load, but
they sit on it, and scold at us while we carry them.”

 

XXVIII.—TI~IE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.

1. But old Mr. Nutcracker, like many other good old
gentlemen squirrels, found that Christmas dinners and other
things were apt to go as his wife said, and his wife was apt to
go as young F eatherhead said ; and so, when Christmas came,
the Chipmunks were not invited, for the ﬁrst time in many
years.

2. The Chipmunks, however, took all pleasantly, and ac I

cepted poor old Mrs. Nutcracker’s awkward apologies with
the best possible grace, and young Tip looked in on Christ-

THE FOURTH READER. 109

mas morning with the compliments of the season and a few‘

beech-nuts, which he had secured as a great dainty. The
fact was, that Tip’s little striped fur coat was so ﬁlled up and
overﬂowing with cheerful good-will to all, that he never could
be made to understand that any of his relations could want
to cut him ; and therefore Featherhead looked down on him
with contempt, and said he had no tact, and couldn’t see
when he was not wanted.

3. It was wonderful to see how, by means of persisting
in remarks like these, young Featherhead at last got all his

' family to look up to him as something uncommon. Though

he added nothing to the family, and required more to be done
for him than all the others put together,—though he showed
not the smallest real perseverance or ability in any thing use-
ful,—-—yet somehow all his brothers and sisters, and his poor
foolish old mother, got into a way of regarding him as some-
thing wonderful, and of delighting in his sharp sayings as if
they had been the wisest things in the world.

4. But at last old papa declared that it was time for
Featherhead to settle himself to some business in life, round-
ly declaring that he could not always have him as a hanger—on
in the paternal hole. e

“ What are you going to do, my boy?” said Tip Chip-
munk to him one day. “ We are driving now a thriving trade
in hickory-nuts, and if you would like to join us ”

“ Thank you,” said Featherhead ; “ but I confess I have
no fancy for any thing so slow as the hickory trade ; I never
was made to grub and delve in that way.”

5. The fact was, that Featherhead had lately been form-

 

A ing alliances such as no reputable squirrel should even think

of. He had more than once been seen going out evenings
with the Rats of Rat I-Iollow,——a race whose reputation for
honesty was more than doubtful. The fact was, further, that
old Longtooth Rat, an old sharper and money-lender, had
long had his eye on F eatherhead as just about silly enough
for their purposes,-—engaging him in what he called a specu-
lation, but which was neither more nor less than downright
stealing. .

6. Near by the chestnut-tree where Nutcracker Lodge
was situated was a large barn ﬁlled with corn and grain, be-

110 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

sides many bushels of hazel-nuts, chestnuts, and Walnuts.
Now old Longtooth proposed to young F eatherhead that he
should nibble a passage into this loft, and there establish him-
self in the commission business, passing the nuts and corn to
him as he wanted them. Old Longtooth knew what he was
about in the proposal, for he had heard talk of a brisk Scotch
terrier that was about to be bought to keep the rats from the
grain 5 but you may be sure he kept his knowledge to him-
self, so that F eatherhead was none the wiser for it.

7. “The nonsense of fellows like Tip Chipmunk!” said

F eatherhead to his admiring brothers and sisters. “ The per-
fectly stupid nonsense ! There he goes, delving and poking,
picking up a nut here and a grain there, when I step into
property at once.”

8. “ But I hope, my son, you are careful to be honest in
your dealings,” said’ old Nutcracker, who was a very moral
squirrel. . ,

With that,‘ young F eatherhead threw his tail saucily over
one shoulder, winked knowingly at his brothers, and said,
“ Certainly, sir ! If honesty consists in getting what you can
while it is going, I mean to be honest.”

9. Very soon F eatherhead appeared to his admiring com-
panions in the height of prosperity. He had a splendid hole
in the midst of a heap of chestnuts, and he literally seemed
to be rolling in wealth ,- he never came home without shower-».
ing lavish gifts on his mother and sisters ,° he Wore his tail
over his back with a buckish air, and patronized Tip Chip-
munk with a gracious nod whenever he met him, and thought
that the world was going well with him.

10. But one luckless day, as F eatherhead was lolling in
his hole, up came two boys with the friskiest, wiriest Scotch
terrier you ever saw. His eyes blazed like torches, and poor

F eatherhead’s heart died within him as he heard the boys say, ,

“ Now we’ll see if we can’t catch the rascal that eats our
grain.”
A F eatherhead tried to slink out at the hole he had gnawed
to come in by, but found it stopped.
“ 0, you are there, are you, Mister? ” said the boy. “ Well,
you don’t get out ; and now for a chase I ”
11. And, sure enough, poor Featherhead ran distracted

forever. He had sprained his left paw, and got a chronic
rheumatism, and the fright and fatigue which he had gone
through had broken up his constitution, so that he never again
could be what he had been 5 but Tip gave him a situation as

XXIX.—TO THE KATYDID.
OLIVER W. HOLMES.

1. I love to hear thine earnest voice,
Wherever thou art hid,
Thou testy little dogmatist,
Thou pretty Katydid !

Thou mindest me of gentlefolks,-—
Old gentlefolks are they,-—
Thou say’st an undisputed thing

In such a solemn way.

2. Thou art a female, Katydid !
I know it by the trill
That quivers through thy piercing notes,
So petulant and shrill. . T

Beneath the hollow tree,——
A knot of spinster Katydids,-—-

3. 0 tell me where did Katy live,

And what did Katy do?

And was she very fair and young,
And yet so wicked, too ?

Did Katy love a naughtyiman,
Or kiss more cheeks than one?

I warrant Katy did no more
Than many a Kate has done.

4. Dear me! I’ll tell you all about
My fuss with little Jane,
And Ann, with whom I used to walk
So often down the lane,
And all that tore their looks of black,
Or wet their eyes of blue,——
Pray, tell me, sweetest Katydid,
What did poor Katy do ?

5. Ah no ! the living oak shall crash,
That stood for ages still,
The rock shall rend its mossy base
And thunder down the hill,——
Before the little Katydid
A Shall add one word, to tell
The mystic story of the maid
Whose name she knows so well.

And when the latest one A
Shall fold in death her feeble wings
Beneath the autumnsun,
Then shall she raise her fainting voice,
And lift her drooping lid,
And then the child of future years
Shall hear what Katy did.

XXX.--THE TWIN TRAPS.

BY MAYNE REID.

Swartboy, a Bushman, and Congo, a Kafﬁr, were servants who at-
tended the hunters Hans, Hendrik, Arend and Groot Willem, mention-
ed in the following story. During the absence of the hunters from
camp, these natives had proceeded to cook a duyker, a species of ante-
lope, and having occasion to go to the river near by for water, Congo,
who was in advance, suddenly disappeared. He had walked on to a

. carefully concealed pit, dug for the purpose of catching hippopotami or

elephants, and falling to the bottom, about nine feet, he was prevented
from extricating himself by the perpendicular sides of the cavity, which

were of a soapy kind of clay. Swartboy was so much amused by the -

114 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

ludicrous incident that he laughed, leaped, and danced around the edge
of the pit in an excess of delight, till instantly he also disappeared as if
swallowed up by an earthquake. Two pitfalls had been constructed
close together, and he now occupied the second. Congo was frantic
with rage, supposing that the Bushman, not content with laughing at his
misfortune, had gone off and left him to his fate. In vain he called
Swartboy and “ Bass Arend,” but no one came. The Bushman, on the

contrary, was so mortiﬁed at ﬁnding himself in a similar plight to that

which had produced his transport of merriment, that he listened in
silence to Congo’s cries for assistance.

1. As time passed on, however, and Swartboy saw that T

the sun was descending, and that the shades of night would
soon be gathering over the river, his hopes began to sink
within him. He could not understand why the young hunter
had not long ago come to release him. Groot Willem,
Hendrik, and Hans should have returned by that time ; and
the four should have made an effectual search for their miss-
ing servants. He had remained silent for a long ,time,
under very peculiar circumstances. But silence now ‘became
unbearable, and he was seized with a sudden desire to ex-
press his dissatisfaction at the manner Fate had been deal-
ing out events,—a desire no longer to be resisted. The
silence was at last broken by his calling out,—

2. “ Congo, you ole fool, where are you? What for don’t
you go home ?”

On the Kafﬁr’s ear the voice fell dull and distant; and

yet he immediately understood whence it came. Like him-'

self, the Bushman was in a living grave I That explained his
neglect to render the long—desired assistance.

“ Lor, Swart! why I waiting for you,” answered Congo,
for the ﬁrst time since his imprisonment attempting a smile ;
“ I don’t want to go to the camp and leave you behind me.”

3. “You think a big sight too much of yourself,” rejoined
the Bushman. “ Who wants to be near such a black ole
fool as you? You may go back to the camp,-and when you
get there jus’ tell Baas Hendrik that Swartboy wants’ to see
him. I’ve got something particular to tell him.”

‘—‘ Very well,” answered the Kaﬂir, becoming more rec-
onciled to his position ; “ what for you want see Baas Hen-
drik? I’ll tell him what you want without making him come
here. What shall I say?”

THE FOURTH READER. 115

4. In answer to this question, Swartboy made a long
speech, in which the Kaﬂir was requested to report himself
as a fool for having fallen into a pit,—that he had shown him-
self more stupid than the sea—cows, that had apparently
shunned the trap for‘ years. On being requested to explain
how one was more stupid than the other,——both having met
with the same mischance,—Swartboy went on to prove that
his misfortune was wholly owing to the fault of Congo, by the
Kaﬁir having committed the ﬁrst folly of allowing himself to
be entrapped.  

5. Nothing, to the Bushman’s mind, could be more clear
than that Congo’s stupidity in falling into the ﬁrst pit had led
to his own downfall into the second. This was now a source
of much, consolation to him, and the verbal expression of his
wrongs enabled him for a while to feel rather happy at the
ﬁne opportunity afforded for revilinghis rival. The amuse-
ment, however, could not prevent his thoughts from returning
to the positive facts that he was imprisoned ; that in place of
passing the day in cooking and eating duyker, he had been
fasting and fretting in a dark, dirty pit, in the companionship
of loathsome reptiles.

6. His mind now expanding under the exercise of a
startled imagination, he became apprehensive. What if
some accident should have occurred to Arend, and prevented
his return to the camp? What if Groot Willem and the
others should have strayed, and should not ﬁnd their way
back to the place for two or three days? He had heard of
such events happening to other stupid white men, and why
not to them? What if they had met a tribe of the savage
inhabitants of the country, and been killed or taken prisoners?

7. These conjectures, and a thousand others, ﬂitted
through the brain of the Bushman, all guiding to the conclu-
sion that, should either of them prove correct, he would ﬁrst
have to eat the reptiles in the pit, and then starve. It was no
consolation to him to think that his rival in the other pit would
have ‘to submit to a similar fate. His unpleasant reveries
were interrupted by a short, angry bark; and, looking up

‘to the opening through which he had descended, he beheld

the countenance of a wild dog,—the “wilde honden” of

r the Dutch Boors.

8. Uttering another and a different cry, the animal started
back ; and from the sounds now heard overhead, the Bush-
man was certain that it was accompanied by many others of
its kind. An instinctive fear of man led them to retreat for
a short distance ; but they soon found out that “ the wicked
ﬂee when no man pursueth,” and they returned. They were
hungry, and had the sense to know that the enemy they had
discovered was, for some reason, unable to molest them.

9. Approaching nearer, and more near, they again gath-

ered around the pits, and saw that food was waiting for them
at the bottom of both. They could contemplate their vic-
tims unharmed, and this made them courageous enough to
think of an attack. The human voice and the gaze of hu-
man eyes had lost their power, and the pack of wild hounds,
counting several score, began to think of taking some steps
towards satisfying their hunger.

10. They commenced scattering and tearing away the
covering of thepits, sending down a shower of dust, sand,
and grass that nearly suffocated the two men imprisoned
beneath. The poles supporting the screen of earth were
rotten with age, and the whole scaffolding threatened to
come down as the wild dogs scampered over it.

“If there should be a shower of dogs,” thought Swart-
boy, “ I hope that fool Congo will have his share of it.”

11. This hope was immediately realized, for the next
instant he heard the bowling of one of the animals evidently
down in the adjoining pit. It had fallen through, but, for-
tunately for Congo, not without injuring itself in a way
that he had but narrowly escaped. The dog had got trans-
ﬁxed on a sharp-pointed stake, planted ﬁrmly in the center
of the pit, and was now hanging on it in horrible agony,
unable to get clear.

12. Without lying down in the mud, the Kaﬂir was una-
ble to keep his face more than twelve inches from the open
jaws of the dog, that in its struggles spun around as on a
pivot ; and Congo had to press close against the side of the
pit, to keep out of the reach of the creature yelping in his
ears. Swartboy could distinguish the utterances of this dog
from those of its companions‘ above, and the interpretation

_ he gave to them was, that a ﬁerce combat was taking place

between it and the Kafﬁr.

THE FOURTH READER. 117

13. The jealousy and petty ill-will so often exhibited by
the Bushman was not so strong as he had himself believed.
His intense anxiety to know which was getting the-best of
the ﬁght, added to the fear that Congo was being torn to
pieces, told him that his friendship for the Kaﬁir far out-
weighed the animosity he fancied himself to have felt.

14. The ﬁendish yells of the dogs, the unpleasant situa-
tion in which he was placed, and the uncertainty of the time
he was to endure it, were we1l—nigh driving him distracted ,-
when just then the wild honden appeared to be beating a
retreat,—the only one remaining being that in the pit with
Congo. What was driving them away? Could assistance be
at hand? Breathlessly the Bushman stood listening.

15. In 1 the afternoon, when Groot Willem, Hans, and
Hendrik returned to the camp, they found it deserted.
Several jackals reluctantly skulked off as they drew near;
and on riding up to the spot from which those creatures had
retired, they saw the clean-picked bones of an antelope.
The camp must have been deserted for several hours.

“ What does this mean?” exclaimed Groot Willem.
“ What has become of Arend ? ”

16. “I don’t know,” answered Hendrik. “ It is strange
Swart and Cong are not here to tell us.”

Something unusual had certainly happened 3 yet, as each
glanced anxiously around the place, there appeared nothing
to explain the mystery.

“What shall we do?” asked Willem, in a tone that ex-
pressed much concern.

“ Wait,” answered Hans ; “ we can do nothing more.”

17. Two or three objects were at this moment observed

which ﬁxed their -attention. They were out on the plain,

nearly a mile off. They appeared to be horses,—their own
pack animals,--and Hendrik and Groot Willem started off
towards them to drive them back to the camp. They were
absent nearly an hour before they succeeded in turning the
horses and driving them towards the camp. As they passed

‘near the drift on their return, they rode towards the river

to water the animals they were riding.
18. On approaching the bank, several native dogs, that
had been yelling in a clump, were seen to scatter and retreat

across the plain. The horsemen thought little of this, but
rode on into the river, and permitted their horses to drink.
While quietly seated in their saddles, Hendrik fancied he
heard some strange sounds. “ Listen!” said he. “I hear
something queer. What is it ?” .

19. “ One of the honden,’.’ answered Willem.

“ Where? ”

This question neither for a moment could answer, until
Groot Willem observed one of the pits from the edge of.
which the dogs appeared to have retreated.

“Yonder’s a pit—trap!.” he exclaimed, “ and I believe
that a dog has got into it. Well, I shall give it a shot,
and put the creature out of its misery.”

20. “ Do so,” replied Hendrik. “ I hate the creatures as
much as any other noxious vermin, but it would be cruel to
let one starve to death in that way. Kill it.”

Willem rode up to the pit and dismounted. Neither of
them, as yet, spoke loud enough to be heard in the pits, and
the two men down below were at this time silent, the dog
alone continuing its cries of agony.

21. The only thing Willem saw on gazing down the
hole was the wild hound still hanging on the stake; and

~ taking aim at one of its eyes he ﬁred. The last spark of

life was knocked, out of the suffering animal ; but the report
of the great gun was instantly followed by two yells more
hideous than were ever uttered by “wild honden.” They
were the screams of two frightened Africans,——each frighten-
ed to think that the next bullet would be for him.

22. “ Arend ! ” exclaimed Willem, anxious about his
brother, and thinking only of him. “ Arend ! is it you?”

“ No, Baas Willem,” answered the Kaﬂir. “ It is Congo.”

Through the opening, Willem reached down the butt-end
of his long riﬂe, while ﬁrmly clasping it by the barrel. The

Kafﬁr took hold with both hands, and, by the strong arms -

of Groot Willem, was instantly extricated from his subter-
ranean prison.

23. Swartboy was next hauled out, and the two mud-be-
daubed individuals stood gazing at one another, each highly
delighted at the rueful appearance presented by his rival.

Slowly the ﬁre of anger, that seemed to have all the

while been burning in the Kafﬁr’s eyes, became extinguished,
and a broad smile broke like the light of day over his stoical
countenance.

XXXI.—THE SONG OF THE CRICKETS.

EMILY H. MILLER.

1. Under the grass, in the bright summer weather,
We little crickets live gayly together 5 _
When the moon shines, and the dew brightly glistens,
All the night long you may hear if you listen-

. I “ Cheep! cheep! cheep!”

We are the crickets that sing you to sleep.

2. We have no houses to store up our treasure,
Gay little minstrels, we live but for pleasure 3
What shall we do when the summer is over,
When the keen frost nips the meadows of clover?

Cheep ! cheep l cheep !

Under the hearthstone for shelter we creep.

3. Then when the ﬁrelight is dancing and glowing,
Nothing we’ll care how the winter is blowing ;
Down in our snug little cells we will sing you
Songs of the brightness the summer will bring you.

Cheep! cheep! cheep!
Summer is coming, though snows may be deep.

HOUSE.
HARRIET B. STOWE.

1. Once upon a time a gentleman went out into a great

‘ forest, and cut away the trees, and built there a Very nice lit-

tle cottage. It was set very low on the ground, and had
very large bow-windows, and so much of it was glass that

120 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

one could look through it on every side and see what was
going on in the forest. You could see the shadows of
the fern-leaves, as they ﬂickered and wavered over the ground,
and the scarlet partridge—berry and wintergreen plums that
matted round the roots of the trees, and the bright spots of
sunshine that fell through their branches and went dancing
about among the bushes and leaves at their roots.

2. You could see the little chipping sparrows and
thrushes and robins and bluebirds building their nests here .

and there among the branches, and watch them from day to
day as they laid‘ their eggs and hatched their young. You
could also see red squirrels, and gray squirrels, and little
striped chip~squirrels, darting and springing about, here and
there and every where, running races with each other from
bough to bough, and chattering at each other in the gayest
possible manner.

3. You may be sure that such a strange thing as a great
mortal house for human beings to live in did not come into
this wild wood without making quite a stir and excitement
among the inhabitants that lived there before. All the time
it was building, there was the greatest possible commotion in
the breasts of all the older population; and there wasn’t
even a black ant, or a cricket, that did not have his own
opinion about it, and did not tell the other ants and crickets
just what he thought the world was coming to in conse-
quence.

4. Old Mrs. Rabbit declared that the hammering and
pounding made her nervous, and gave her. most melancholy
forebodings of evil times. “ Depend upon it, children,” she
said to her long-eared family, “ no good will come to us from
this establishmeﬂ. Where man is, there comes always
trouble for us poor rabbits.” ,

5. The old chestnut-tree, that grew on the edge of the
woodland ravine, drew a great sigh which shook all
his leaves, and expressed it as his conviction that no good
would ever come of it,——a conviction that at once struck to
the heart of every chestnut-burr. The squirrels talked to-
gether of the dreadful state of things that would ensue.
“Why,” said old Father Gray, “it’s evident that Nature

made the nuts for us ; but one of these great human creatures e

will carry off and gormandize upon what would keep a hun«
dred poor families of squirrels in comfort.”

6. Old Ground-mole said it did not require very sharp
eyes to see into the future, and it would just end in bringing
down the price of real estate in the whole vicinity, so that
every decent—minded and respectable quadruped would be
obliged to move away ; for his part, he was ready to sell out
for any thing he could get. The bluebirds and bobolinks, it
is true, took more cheerful views of matters 3 but then, as
old Mrs. Ground—mole observed, they were a ﬂighty set,——
half their time careering and dissipating in the Southern
States,——and could not be expected to have that patriotic
attachment to their native soil that those had who had
grubbed in it from their earliest days.

7. “This race of man,” said the old chestnut tree, “is
never ceasing in its restless warfare on Nature. In our forest
solitudes, hitherto, how peacefully, how quietly, how regularly,
has every thing gone on! Not a ﬂower has missed its ap-
pointed time of blossoming, or failed to perfect its fruit. N 0
matter how hard has been the winter, how loud the winds
have roared, and how high the snow—banks have been piled,
all has come right again in spring. Not the least ‘root has
lost itself under the snows, so’ as not to be ready with its fresh
leavesand blossoms when the» sun returns to melt the frosty
chains of winter.

and the winds howl and beat ; but, when all is past, every

  thing comes out better and brighter than before,e—not a bird

is killed, not the frailest ﬂower destroyed. But man. comes,
and in one day he will make a desolation that centuries can-
not repair. Ignorant boor that he is, and all incapable of
appreciating the glorious works of Nature, it seems to be his
glory to be able to destroy in a few hours what it -was the
work of ages to iroduce, T

when he died ,- it was growing here when the ﬁrst ship
brought the white men to our shores, and hundreds and
hundreds of those whom they call bravest, wisest, strongest,
-—warriors, statesmen, orators and poets,-—have been born,
have grown up, lived, and died, while yet it has outlived
them all. It has seen more wisdom than the best of them ;
but two or three hours of brutal strength sufficed to lay it low.

10.‘ “ VVhich of these dolts could make a tree? I’d like
to see them do any thing like it. How noisy and clumsy are
all their movements,——chopping, pounding, rasping, hammer-
ing ! And, after all, what do they build? In the forest we
do every thing so quietly. A tree would be ashamed of itself
that could not get its growth without making such a noise
and dust and fuss. Our life is the perfection of good man-
ners. For my part, I feel degraded at the mere presence of
these human beings 3 but alas! I am old ;——a hollow place
at my heart warns me of the progress of decay, and probably
it will be seized upon by these rapacious creatures as an
excuse for laying me as low as my noble green brother.”

11. In spite of all this disquiet about it, the little cottage
grew and was ﬁnished. The walls were covered with pretty
paper, the ﬂoors carpeted with pretty carpets ; and, in fact,
when it was all arranged, and the garden walks laid out, and
beds of ﬂowers planted around, it began to be corifessed,
even among the most critical, that it was not after all so bad
a thing as was to have been feared.

1;, A black ant went in one day and made a tour of ex‘:
ploration up and down, over chairs and tables, up the ceilings

and down again, and, coming out, wrote an article for the
Crickets’ Gazette, in which he described the new abode as a‘

veritable palacé‘. Several butterﬂies ﬂuttered in and sailed
about and were wonderfully delighted, and then a bumble-
bee and two or three honey-bees, who expressed themselves
well pleased with the house, but more especially enchanted,
with the garden. I

fern that began to grow up under the trees in spring,--that
they never allowed a gun to be ﬁred to scare the birds, and
watched the building of their nests with the greatest interest,
—then an opinion in favor of human beings began to gain
ground, and every cricket and bird and beast was loud in
their praise. i

14. “Mamma,” said young Tit—bit, a frisky young squir-
rel, to his mother one day, “why won’t you let Frisky and
me go into that pretty new cottage to play? ” '

“ My dear,” said his mother, who was a very wary and
careful old squirrel, “ how can you think of it? Men are full
of devices for traps and pitfalls, and who could say what
might happen, if you put yourself in their power? If you
had wings like the butterﬂies and bees, you might ﬂy in and
out again, and so gratify your curiosity 3 but, as matters
stand, it’s best for you to keep well out of their way.”

15. “ But, mother, there is such a nice, good lady lives
there ! I believe she is a good fairy, and she seems to love
us all so ; she sits in the bow-window and watches us for
hours, and she scatters corn all round at the roots of the
tree for us to eat.”  

“ She is nice enough,” said the old mother-squirrel, “ if you
keep far enough off, but I tell you, you can’t be too careful.’’

 

XXXIII.——THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.

1. Now this good fairy that the squirrels discoursed about
was a nice little old lady that the children used to call Aunt
Esther, and she was a dear lover of birds and squirrels, and
all sorts of animals, and had studied their little ways till she
knew just Whatwould please them 3 and so she would every
day ‘throw out crumbs for the sparrows, and little bits of
thread and wool and cotton to help the birds that were build-
ing their nests, arrd would scatter corn and nuts for the squir-
rels ; and while she .sat at her work in the bow-window she
would smile to see the birds ﬂying away with the wool, and
the squirrels nibbling their nuts. After a while the birds
grew so tame that they would hop into the bow-window, and
eat their crumbs off the carpet. o

2. “There, mamma,” said Tit—bit and Frisky, “ only see!
Ienny Wren and Cock Robin have been in atthe bow-win-
dow, and it didn’t hurt them, and why can’t we go? ”

“Well, my dears,”said the old Mother Squirrel, “you
must do it very carefully : never forget that you haven’t
wings like Jenny Wren and Cock Robin.”

3‘. So the next‘ day Aunt Esther laid a train of coma

from the roots of the trees to the bow-window, and then from

the bow-window to her work-basket, which stood on the floor ,

beside her ; and ‘then she put quite a’ handful of corn in the
work-basket, and sat down by it, and seemed intent on her
sewing. Very soon, creep, creep, creep, came it-bit and
Frisky to the window, and then into the room, just as sly and
as still as could be, and Aunt Esther sat just like a statue
for fear of ‘disturbing them. They looked all around in
high glee, and when they came to the basket it seemed to
them awonderful little summer-house, made on purpose for
them to play in. They nosed about in it, and turned over
the scissors and the needle-book, and took a nibble at her
white wax, and jostled the spools, meanwhile stowing away
the corn each side of their little chops, till they both of them
looked as if they had the mumps.

4. At last Aunt Esther put out her hand to touch them, .

when, whisk-frisk, out they went, and up the trees, chattering
and laughing, before she had time even to wink.
But after this they used to come in every day, and when

A she put corn in her hand and held it very still, they would

eat out of it 3 and, ﬁnally, they would get into her hand,
until one day she gently closed it over them, and Frisky
and Tit—bit were fairly caught.

5. 0 how theirhearts beat ! but the good fairy only spoke
gently to them, and soon unclosed her hand and let them go
again. So, day after day, they grew to have more and more
faith in her, till they would climb into her work—basket, sit on
her shoulder, or nestle away in her lap as she sat sewing.
They made also long exploring voyages all over the house,
up and through all the chambers, till ﬁnally, I grieve to say,
poor Frisky came to an untimely end by being drowned in
the water-tank at the top of the house.

6. The dear good fairy passed away from the house in

THE FOURTH READER. 125

time, and went to a land where the ﬂowers never fade, and
the birds never die 3 but the squirrels still continued to make
the place a favorite resort.

7. “ In fact, my dear,” said old Mother Red, one winter,
to her mate, “what is the use of one’s living in this cold,
hollow tree, when these amiable people have erected this
pretty cottage where there is plenty of room for us andthem
too P Now I have examined between the eaves, and there is
a charming place where we can store- our nuts, and where

a we can whip in and out‘ of the garret, and have the free

range of the house; and, say what you will, these humans
have delightful ways of being warm and comfortable in
winter.” ’ '

8. So Mr. and Mrs. Red set up housekeeping in the cot-
tage, and had no end of nuts and other good things stored
up there. The trouble of all this was, that, as Mrs. Red was
a notable body, and got up to begin her housekeeping opera-

tions, and woke up «all her children, at four o’clock in the morn-,

ing, the good people often were disturbed by a great rattling
and fuss in the walls, while yet it seemed dark night. Then
sometimes, too, I grieve to say, Mrs. Squirrel would give her
husband vigorous curtain lectures in the night, which made
him so indignant that he would rattle off to another quarter
of the garret to sleep by himself; and all this broke the rest
of the worthy people who built the house. _

9. What is to be done about this we don’t know. What
would you do about it? Would you let the squirrels live- in
your house or not? When our good people come down of a
cold winter morning, and see the squirrels dancing and frisk-
ing down the trees, and chasing each other so merrily over
the garden-chair, or sitting with their tails sauci-ly over their
backs, they look so jolly and jaunty and pretty, that the said
good people almost forgive them for disturbing their night’s
rest, and think that nothing shall be done to drive them out
of the garret to-day. And so it goes on 3 but how long the
squirrels will rent the cottage in this fashion, I’m sure I dare
not undertake to say.

When the dark ﬁr-branch into verdure breaks.

From the streams and founts I have loosed the

Where the Violets lie may be now your home.

XXXVI.-,--AMONG THE ICE—CUTTERS.

J. T. TROWBRIDGE.

1. The boys——and, I am glad to say, the girls too-—had
enjoyed a few days of the very ﬁnest skating, when one night
there came a fall of snow, and the next morning Lawrence,
looking from his window, saw the pond covered with a shin-
ing white mantle

130 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

“ Never mind,” said he ; “we can sweep places to skate

‘on. A good skater don’t care for a space larger than a parlor

floor to practice on.”

2. So he went out that afternoon with a shovel and a
broom to clear off a little of the snow. He was surprised to
ﬁnd a number of men on the pond before him. They had
long chisel—shaped iron bars, with which they were cutting
holes in the ice about ﬁve paces apart, all over the pond.

3. “Look here!” cried Lawrence, running up to one of
them, “ what is this for? You’re spoiling our skating.”

“Your skating is spoiled already,” said the man; and
click ./ click / his bar went through the ice again. “ Our busi-
ness would be spoiled too, if we did’nt cut these holes.”

“I don’t see how?”

4. “ I’ll tell you how. This coating of snow prevents the
ice from forming. Snow is warm; did you know it? A

sheep covered up in a drift will live through a night that
would freeze her to death if she were exposed to the weather.‘

Just so, a heavy fall of snow is the best thing in the world to
keep strawberries and other plants from winter-killing. It
keeps the pond warm in the same way. “Ice will form, to be
sure, under the snow, but so slow we shouldn’t get half a
crop if We didn’t out these holes and let the water through.”

5. “I see,” cried Lawrence. “The weight of the snow
makes the ice sink a little; that forces the water up, and the
water soaks the snow, and then freezes and makes ice.”

“ Yes, but that top-ice—-—.mo*w-z’ce, we call it—is good for
nothing. It’s only a bother to us, as you will see if you are
here when we are cutting. But it don’t prevent the ice from

_ forming underneath, as the snow does.”

6. “ I understand ;—the ice is a good conductor of caloric,
and the snow isn’t,” said Lawrence, who had learned enough
of natural philosophy to come to this conclusion. “But
why don’t you have some sort of horse-scrapers to scrape
the snow off? ”

“We have horse-scrapers, but now the ice ain’t "strong
enough to bear _a horse ; that’s the trouble.”

7. “Will it be good skating after the snow soaks and
freezes?” “

“ It will be-pretty rough. There’s a good strip along by

THE FOURTH READER. 131

the Doctor’s shore where we don’t cut ; it is kept for skating
and ﬁshing. You can sweep the snow from that, if you like,
and cut holes for pickerel too,-—a thing that ain’t allowed on
any other part of the pond.”

8. “ How can you prevent it ?‘ Do you own the pond? ”

“ No, but the ice-company have bought the privilege of '
cutting, from all the owners around the pond, and so control
it. Pickerel holes would spoil the ice at the time of cutting;
besides, the horses would get their legs in them.”

9. Lawrence was very anxious to see the work begin.
He skated meanwhile on his uncle’s shore, and after the

y snow-ice had frozen he went all over the pond,-although,

as the man had predicted, he found it pretty rough.

Thenvthere came another fall of snow. By this time the
ice was ﬁrm enough to bear up horses, and the workmen came
on it with plank—scrapers six feet broad, and scraped the snow
all up, like hay, in big windrows stretching across the pond.

10. Then there came still another snow, accompanied by
sleet, and followed by rain; so that, when the storm was
over, the pond was covered with a coarse frozen crust, too
hard for the wooden scrapers. This brought out the iron-
edged scoop-scrapers, formedfor removing either heavy or
crusted snow. Each scraper was drawn by a single horse,
with a harness which consisted of a simple girth and loops
for the shafts.

11. -At last, one bright morning, early in January, Law-
rence looked from his window and saw that the ice-harvest
had fairly begun. It was Wednesday 3 there was no school
in the afternoon, and as soon as he had eaten his dinner he
hastenedout to see the ice-cutters.

12. There were two men ﬁshing on his uncle’s shore.
Having chopped holes in the ice, they dropped their hooks
through them, baited with live minnows, which had been
caught in the autumn and preserved in tanks for this purpose.
Their minnows were in apail ; an ax and three or four pick-
erel lay on the ice ; and each man was watching half a dozen
lines sunk in different places, a few yards apart, and ad-
justed so that a bite at either would pull down a rag‘ of red
ﬂannel set up on a stick for a signal. - w

13. Lawrence like most boys, took a lively interest in

132 ANALYTICAL smurs.

ﬁshing. But something of still greater interest attracted him
to-day 5 and stopping but a few minutes to watch the sport,
he hastened on to the scene of the ice—cutting. Two or
three hundred men were at work on the pond, in two divis-
ions, one at the upper and the other at the lower end ,- pre-
senting, with their horses and ice—saws and ice-hooks and
cutters and scrapers and planes, a wonderfully animated and
busy picture. T

14. He chose to visit the lower end ﬁrst, because he there
expected to ﬁnd the man whose acquaintance he had already
made. He saw some men at work with a long, straight strip
of board and a curious-looking instrument, and ran up to
them. One of the men got down on his face and took sight
across the board at a target, while the others drew the instru-
ment along the edge of it. They thus marked the ice, some—
what as a school—boy draws a straight line with a pencil and
ruler.

15. The man who had taken sight got up, and Lawrence
saw that it was his old acquaintance.

“ So you’ve come to see the ice—cutting. Well, here you
have what is properly the beginning of it. We are striking a
straight line, which is almost ﬁnished.” .

Three or four more lengths of the board brought them to
the target, set up by one of the windrows of snow.

16. “ This board is what we call a straight-edge. Here is
an arm to it which we now open ; and you see it lies on the
ice like a carpenter’s square. Now we are to strike another
line at right angles with this , and so we lay out our square-
cornered ﬁelds of any number of acres, which are to be all
cut up into such ‘cakes as the ice-man brings you in summer.

. This instrument we mark with is called a hand-groove. You

see it has seven steel teeth, set one behind another, and
riveted in this strong iron back. Each tooth is a quarter of
an inch broad, and forms a sharp little plow by itself. The
ﬁrst cuts the slightest groove in the ice ; the second is a triﬂe
longer, and cuts a trifle deeper ,- the third deeper still ; and
so on, till the last, which leaves the groove an inch and a

* half deep.”

17. “You go all around your ﬁeld in this way?” said
Lawrence.

THE FOURTH READER. 133

“ No, only on two sides. Now see,—here comes an odd
looking horse-machine down the line we have struck. That
is what we call a guz'a’e—mm’-marieer. The guzkie is a smooth-
edged blade that runs in the groove we have cut. The mcméei
is a cutter made on the same principle with this hand-groove.
The two are so ﬁtted and fastened together that, when the
guide runs in the groove, the marker cuts another parallel
groovetwenty-two inches from it.”

18. As the machine approached, Lawrence saw that it was
drawn by a single strong rope, ﬁfteen or twenty feet long,
which kept it at a distance from the horse. The horse was
led by one man, and the machine held by its handles, like a
plow, by another. The marker made a crisp, brittle sound,
and threwout ﬁne, bright chips, as the teeth cut through the
ice ; and after it had passed, Lawrence saw that there were

two perfectly straight, beautiful grooves instead of one.

19. Arrived at the corner of the new ﬁeld, the horse was
turned about, and the machine (by means of an ingenious
arrangement) turned over, so that, returning, the guide ran in
the freshly-‘cut groove, and another groove was cut by the
marker, twenty-two inches farther on.

20. “ In this way,” said Lawrence’s friend, “ the machine
goes over the whole ﬁeld, the last groove it cuts forming the
boundary of the other side. Then it commences on this
line, which we are here running at right angles with the ﬁrst,
and goes over the whole ﬁeld the other way, cutting it all up
into checkers twenty-two inches square. The marker cuts a
groove two inches deep. T

21. “ Now you see another machine following it, drawn
by a horse, just the same. But instead of being double, like

’ the guide-and—marker, it is a single instrument, made up of

teeth like the marker 3 only the teeth are longer, and they cut
deeper. That we call a four-inch cutter, as it leaves the
groove four inches deep, That will be followed by a six-inch
cutter, and that by an eight-inch, and that again by a ten—inch.
Each cuts two inches, which is about as much as a horse
ought to be compelled to do. ‘We have also a twelve—inch

V cutter, but this ice is not thick enough to require it.”

22. “ Do you cut clear through the ice? I shouldn’t think
that would do.” .

134

“ N o, '1ndeed. This ice is about ﬁfteen inches thick, and
we shall cut it only ten inches. VVe have harvested ice when
it was only ten inches thick, and again when it was twenty-
three inches ; but that is rare. Sixteen inches is a good
average thickness for working.”

ANALYTICAL SERIES}

XXXVII.—-THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.

1. Lawrence remained with his friend until the second
line was struck. By this time a new machine, likewise drawn
by a horse, made its appearance. It was the ice—plane
twenty-two inches broad, running between two grooves, and

planing off the porous s720w—z'ce which has already been de-

scribed.

“ Now,” said the man,“ we will see how the ice is housed.”
And he took Lawrence over a ﬁeld where a hundred men had
been at work all the morning.

2. It was a busy scene. On one side, the six, eight, and
ten-inch cutters were going. On the other, men were break-
ing off broad rafts of the grooved ice, and ﬂoating them along
a canal which had been cut to the ice-houses. Some were
cutting through to the water with saws. Others were splitting
off the sheets, the ends of which had been thus cut, with iron
bars called “ barring-off bars.” Still others, by means of
“ ca1king—bars,” were calking with ice-chips the ends of the
grooves which were to come in contact with the water.

8. “ The calking,” said Lawrence’s friend, “is to keep the
water from running into the grooves. For if it gets into
them, it will circulate all through them, and then freeze, and
the ice will be a solid mass again, as if it hadn’t been grooved
at all. ‘

4. “These rafts, or sheets of cakes, are, you see, thirty
cakes long and twelve broad. The ends have to be sawed ;
but every twelfth groove——in this direction, 1engthwise—is cut
deeper than the rest, so that one man can -easily bar off a
sheet. Ice splits very easy from top to bottom, but it is hard
to split it in any other direction. Lay a cake up out of water
in a warm day, and it will always begin to honeycomb from

O

the top downwards. Turning it on its side makes no differ
ence with it 3 the frost insists on taking down its work first
where it began to build it up. This shows that ice has a
grain.” .

5. The sheet of three hundred and sixty cakes, being
split off, with its grooves all carefully calked around the ends
and sides exposed to the water, was then ﬂoated off into the
canal, and dragged on towards the ice-houses. One man
armed with an ice-hook,—an instrument resembling a pike
pole,—sometimes riding on the sheet, and sometimes walk-
ing by the edge of the canal, navigated this checkered raft to
the slip, where it was broken up with bars into blocks of -six
cakes each, by men standing on the platform. Each of these
blocks was fastened upon by an iron grapple, and taken by
two men and a horse up an inclined plane to the summit of
a strong staging, built before the windows of a row of white
ice-houses.

6. One man guided the horse ; the other guided the
block along the smooth rails with a wooden handle attached
to the grapple. _ It was lively work, one horse going up after
another at a swift pace. At the ‘summit of the staging, the
blocks were seized by men with ice-hooks, and shoved along
the now slightly declining rails towards the windows where
they were wanted. Swiftly sliding, one after another, went
the bright crystal masses, to be seized again by men standing
at the windows, and whirled into the ice-houses, where, layer
upon layer, they were stored away.

7. “ As soon as the ice in these is built up to the level
of this staging, the horses will begin to carry it up the next
one” (for there was another staging above the ﬁrst), “from

A that we shall ﬁll the houses nearly to the top ; then the ice

will be completely covered with hay. Each of these vaults,”
continued Lawrence’s friend, as they went up and looked
into one of the great, gloomy buildings, into which the blocks
went sliding and bouncing, and where several dimly—seen
men were at work taking care of ‘them, looking like demons

_ in a pit,-—“ each of these vaults holds ﬁve thousand tons of

Ice. .
8. “You will see, behind the ice-houses, trains of cars
loading at the same time. The cars take the ice to ships in

the harbor, and they takeit to all parts of the world. We
want to cut, this year, sixty—ﬁve or seventy thousand tons.
Our two hundred and ﬁfty men will cut about ﬁve thousand
tons a day.” V

Lawrence noticed that the ice-houses had very thick
wooden walls ; but his friend said: “ Each wall is in reality
two walls, two feet apart, with the space between ﬁlled in
with tan—bark, which is the best thing we have for keeping
out the heat.” .

9. “ Do you ever cut two crops of ice the same season? ”

“ Seldom. The second freezing makes poor ice com-
pared with the ﬁrst. I don’t pretend to give the reason.
There is a great difference in the quality of ice for keeping.
Ice cut in melting weather is porous, and won’t keep half as
long as ice cut incold weather.”

10. “ It seems to me,” said Lawrence, as they descended
the inclined plane, “machinery might be invented to take
the place of ‘these horses in elevating the ice.”

“ Well, how would you arrange it? ”

11. “I don’t know; but I’ve been thinking you might
have two wheels, one at the water down there, and the other
at the top‘of the ice—house 3 have an endless chain pass over
them, hung full of grapples ; set it in motion by an ordinary
steam-engine ; and let the grapples catch the blocks of ice in
the slip, and- carry them up an inclined plane to the stagings.”

12. The man laughed. “ Go to the other end of the
pond, and you’ll ﬁnd very much such a machine as you have
suggested. A common steam-engine of forty horse—power
does the work of a hundred and ﬁfty men and seventy-ﬁve
horses, anddoes it quicker and better. We shall elevate
all our ice in that way another year.” .

13. Lawrence hastened to the upper ice-houses, and saw
to his delight, the operation of the new machine. It was so
much like the one he had arranged in his own mind, that he
began to consider himself a great inventor. The ﬂoating
blocks, of two cakes each, were fed into a little slip under
the lower wheel, which revolved just over the water. They
were there seized by the grapples, which, coming down empty
on the upper side of the moving chain, returned loaded on
the underside.

THE FOURTH READER. 137

14. Stiff ratan brooms, fastened to the platform, swept
the blocks clean, as the grapples carried them up. The
crystallized pond-water was thus elevated by this chain pump,
and poured into the ice—house windows,—the rattling and
sliding masses, as they ﬂew along the stagings, resembling
an endless train of silver-bright cars seen on high bridges
in the distance. There were four stagings, one above an
other, running the whole length of a long row of ice—houses.

15., The ice was elevated at one end, so that one machine
answered for all. The blocks were launched by the grapples
upon a short inclined plane, which set them sliding down
the gently sloping staging to the windows, where they were
seized. The houses being ﬁlled to the level of one staging,
the ice was then, by a slight alteration in the machinery,
carried up to the next. .

16. There was something about this harvesting of the
ice so brisk and beautiful that Lawrence remained all the
afternoon watching it; and more than once, afterwards, he
Went to spend a delightful hour among the ice-cutters.

XXXIX.——THE VIOLET’S LESSON.
SUSAN E. DICKINSON. /

1. One bright day early in spring—time a cluster of timid
little Violets, which had pushed‘ their Way up through the
damp mold, opened their eyes and looked out on the world

around them. They found themselves just within the edge
of a large wood, with noble old forest—trees lifting their heads
in stately grace on every side, and vigorous young saplings
shooting up here and there between. The whole wood was
ﬁlled with the music of the birds which had ﬂown north from
some sunny clime to herald the approach of summer. And
close beside the timid violets, so near that they could lean
over and look down into its clear waters, a bright stream
went hurrying by, out into the meadows and ﬁelds beyond,
and on, on, as far as the violets could see 5 how much farther
they did not know.

2. Every thing about them was so grand or so beautiful,
and so full of life, that the poor little violets felt themselves
very insigniﬁcant beings indeed, in this strange, glad world
into which they had entered. And they shrank closer to—
gether, as if each would shelter itself behind the other, when
the golden April sunshine, glancing through the budding
boughs above them, spied them out and sent a stray beam
to cheer them and brighten up their delicate blue petals.
Presently an oriole perched himself on one of the branches
of a gracefulelm close by, and warbled as if he would pour
out his very heart in music,——such a song of life and glad-
ness and love.

3. “ Oh!” sighed one of the violets, when the strain

paused for a moment, “ if we could have voices like that to

rejoice every living thing within hearing, it would indeed be
something to live for. Would it not be a grand thing, sisters,
if We could be of some use in this beautiful world ? ”

4. Low as the whisper was, the oriole, who was just poising
himself on the bough above, preparatory to another outburst of
melody, heard it, and, looking down, said : “Why, you are of
use, little ones ! It is your business here to grow up just as
fresh and lovely as you can, and help to make the world
more beautiful. Every one cannot sing, to be sure ; but
every one can do what is in his own power.” And so, hav-
ing answered the violet, he launched out into his song again
exultingly, joining the chorus of woodland minstrels who
were rejoicing on every side.

5. But the violet whispered to her sisters lower than be-
fore : “Ah, but I wish we could do something! It is all

very well to be beautiful, although I doubt if such poor little
tiny things as we are any thing very wonderful in that way.’
The April wind swept across them and bent their heads over
the clear stream. “Look at yourselves in the water, and
see if you have not been made beautiful enough to help to
gladden the world, and do not sigh for more than has been
given you. Live your own life to the utmost; be fragrant
and blooming, and you do your part.”

6. And the stream looked up to them, and sang also in.

its low murmurous ripple, “ Every thing has its own work to
do in the world! Mine is to freshen the grass and ﬂowers,
that, like yourselves, grow near my green margin, and the
lofty trees that mirror themselves in my waters, and after
a while, when I have expanded into a broad river, to bear on
my bosom noble ships that carry men whither they wish to
go. Rejoice in the sunshine and soft air, and be as lovely as
you can,——as lovely as you were designed to be,—-—and in
time you will know for what use you are destined.
Be content till then.” So the April wind swept on to visit
other ﬂowers, and the brook ﬂowed along its pebbly bed,
singing low to itself as before.

7. And the violets still looked up timidly, but they wel-
comed the warm, bright sun-rays when they shone in upon
them, bringing to them fresh life and color 3 they breathed
out their delicate fragrance lovingly on the soft spring airs,
which gently caressed them. And so they bloomed in per-
fect beauty, unseen for a while by human eyes. But on one
sunny day two young girls came wandering through the
wood, searching for wild ﬂowers, and listening to the birds.

8. Presently one of them paused above the cluster of
violets. “O Laura, see what lovely violets ! I am going
to paint them for mamma. If I should gather them, they
would -wither long before I could take them to her. But if I
copy them as faithfully as I can, they will be the loveliest re»
minder of the spring that I can send to her in the close, built-
up city.” So she sat down on a fallen tree n.ear by, and sketch
ed and painted the delicate wee things in the book she carried
with her, while the violets stood in an ecstacy of delight at
ﬁnding how much joy they could give by their beauty. Then
the young girls went on and left the wood to its solitude.

9. All things went on as before. The birds sang their
love-songs, ﬂitting to and fro ,- the trees put forth fresh leaves,
and grew greener every day, and gave deeper shade; the
stream rippled merrily on its way. Occasionally some care-
less woodman strolled, whistling, along a faintly trodden
path that led through the heart of the wood, or a troop of
merry children, let loose for holiday, came seeking wild-
ﬂowers ; but none of them found the violets, until one golden
morning there came a little pale-faced, blue—eyed girl, drawn
by her brothers in a light basket carriage. The little girl
had been sick for weeks, but with the opening spring she had
revived, and now on soft, sunny days, she was ableto go out
in this way to take the air. I '

10. As her brothers drew her along near the margin of the
stream, she spied the violets, and the blue eyes grew bright
with pleasure. “ O Artie! Charlie!” she exclaimed, “ won’t
you take up the violets very carefully for me, roots and all,
with the earth around them? I want to carry them home
and put them in a‘ ﬂower-pot in my room, where I can tend
them myself, and see them whenever I wish, when I can not
run about to look for ﬂowers.” And Artie and Charlie, glad
to please their darling sister, took up the delicate cluster with
the greatest care, and, holding the earth in which it grew
ﬁrmly together by means of paper wrapped around it, they
laid the prize in Edith’s lap, and drew her home.

11. And so the violets, transferred to Edith’s room,
bloomed as beautifully as in their native wood ; for loving
care never failed them ; and day by day, while Edith gather-

, ed health and strength, the blue eyes shone down on them

with an ever new delight. And Edith’s visitors often smiled

with pleasure as her ﬂowers suggested to them some pleasant

thought, or brought the brightness and freshness of nature,
too often forgotten, into their daily lives.

12. So the violets found their use. And day after day, as.
they breathed out their lives in bloom and fragrance, the
breeze that wandered in at the open windows heard the violet
which had spoken before whisper to her sisters, “ Ah, when I

XL.--THE LITTLE POST—BOY.

BAYARD TAYLOR.

1. Very few foreigners travel in Sweden in the winter, on.

account of the intense cold. As you go northward from
Stockholm, the capital, the country becomes ruder and
wilder, and the climate more severe. In the sheltered val-
leys along the Gulf of Bothnia and the rivers which empty
into it, there are farms and villages for a distance of seven
or eight hundred miles, after which fruit—trees disappear, and
nothing will grow in the short, cold summers except potatoes
and a little barley. Farther inland, there are great forests
and lakes, and ranges of mountains where bears, wolves, and
herds of wild reindeer make their home. N 0 people could
live in such a country unless they were very industrious and
thrifty. -

2. I made my journey in the winter, because I was on

I my way to Lapland, where it is easierto travel when the

swamps andrivers are frozen, and the reindeer sleds can ﬂy
along over the smooth snow. It was very cold indeed the
greater part of the time ; the days were short and dark, and

i if I had not found the people so kind, so cheerful, and so

honest, I should have felt inclined to turn back, more than
once. But I do not think there are better people in the world
than those who live in Norrland, which is a Swedish province
commencing about two hundred miles north of Stockholm.
3. They are a tall, strong race, with yellow hair and
bright blue eyes and the handsomest teeth I ever saw. They
live plainly, but very comfortably, in snug wooden houses,
with double windows and doors to keep out the cold 5 and
since they cannot do much out-door work in~the winter, they
spin and weave and mend their farming implements in the
large family room, thus enjoying the cold weather in spite of
its severity. They are very happy and contented, and few of

THE FOURTH READER. 143

them would be willing to leave that cold country and make
their homes in a warmer climate.

4. Here there are neither railroads nor stages, but the
government has established post-stations at distances varying
from ten to twenty miles. At each station a number of
horses, and sometimes vehicles, are kept ; but generally the
traveler has his own sled, and simply hires the horses from
‘one station to another. These horses are either furnished by
the keeper of the station or some of the neighboring farmers,
and, when they are wanted, a man or boy goes along with the
traveler to bring them back. It would be quite an independ-
ent and convenient way of traveling, if the horses were al-
ways ready ; but sometimes you must wait an hour or more
before they can be furnished.

I 5. I had my own little sled, ﬁlled with hay and covered
with reindeer—skins to keep me warm. So long as the Weather
was not too cold, it was very pleasant to speed along through
the dark forests, overlthe frozen rivers, or past farm after
farm in the sheltered valleys, up hill and down, until long
after the stars came out, and then to get a warm supper in
some dark-red post cottage, while the cheerful people sang or
told stories around the ﬁre.

6. The cold increased a little every day, to be sure, but I

' became gradually accustomed to it, and soon began to fancy

that the arctic climate was not so diﬁicult to endure as I had
supposed. At ﬁrst the thermometer fell to zero ; ‘then it went
down ten degrees below 5 then twenty, and ﬁnally thirty. Be-
ing dressed in thick furs from head to. foot, I did not suffer
greatly; but I was very glad when the people assured me
that such extreme cold never lasted more than two or three

' days. Boys of twelve or fourteen very often went with me to

bring back their fathers’ horses, and so ‘long as those. lively,
red-cheeked fellows could face the weather, it would not do
for me to be afraid.

7. One night there was a wonderful aurora in the sky.
The streamers of red and blue light darted hither and thither,

_ chasing each other up to the zenith and down again to the

northern horizon, with a rapidity and abrilliance which I had
never seen before. “There will be a storm soon,” said my
post—boy ; “ one always comes after these lights.”

144 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

8. Next morning the sky was overcast and the short dav
was as dark as our twilight. But it was not quite so cold,
and I traveled onward as fast as possible. There was a long
tract of wild and thinly settled country before me, and I
wished to get through it before stopping for the night. Un-
fortunately it happened that two lumber-merchants were
traveling the same way, and had taken the horses ; so I was
obliged to wait at the stations until other horses were brought

from the neighboring farms. This delayed me so much that.

at seven o’clock in the evening I had still. one more stretch
of three Swedish miles before reaching the vil.lage where I
intended to spend the night. Now, a Swedish mile is nearly
equal to seven English, so that this distance was at least
twentymiles long.

49. I decided to take supper while the horse was eating
his feed. They had not expected any more travelers at the
station, and were not prepared. The keeper had gone on
with the two lumber-merchants 3 but his wife—,-a friendly, rosy.
faced woman-—prepared me some excellent coffee, potatoes,
and stewed reindeer-meat, upon which I made an excellent
meal. The house was on the border of a large, dark forest, and
the roar of the icy northern wind in the trees seemed to in-
crease while I waited in the warm room. I did not feel inclin-
ed to go forth into the wintry storm, but, having set my mind
on reaching the village that night, I was loath to turn back.

10. “It is a bad night,” said the woman, “and my hus-

band will certainly stay at Umea until morning. His name -

is Neils Petersen, and I think you will ﬁnd him at the post-

house when you get there. Lars will take you, and they can -

come back together.”

“ Who is Lars? ” I asked.

“My son,” said she. “ He is getting the horse ready.
There is nobody else about the house to-night.”

11. Just then the door opened, and in came Lars. He
was about twelve years old; but his face was so rosy, his
eyes so clear and round‘ éfhd blue, and his golden hair was
blown back from his face in such silky curls, that he appeared
to be even younger. I was surprised that his mother should

be willing to send him twenty miles through the dark woods

on such a night.

THE FOURTH READER. 145

12. “ Come here, Lars,” I said. Then I took him by the
hand, and asked, “ Are you not afraid to go so far to-
night ? ”

He looked at me with wondering eyes, and smiled ; and
his mother made haste to say : “ You need have no fear, sir.
Lars is young 3 but he’ll take you safe enough. If the storm
don’t get worse, you’ll be at Umea by eleven o’clock.”

13. I was again on the point of remaining 5 but while I
was deliberating with myself, the boy had put on his overcoat
of sheep-skin, tied the lappets of his fur cap under his chin,
and a thick woolen scarf around his nose and mouth, so that
only the round blue eyes were visible ; and then his mother
took down the mittens of hare’s fur from the stove, where
they had been hung to dry. He put them on, took a short
leather whip, and was ready. ,

14. I wrapped myself in my furs, and we went out to~
gether. The driving snow cut me in the face like needles,
but Lars did not mind it in the least. He jumped into the
sled, which he had ﬁlled with fresh, soft hay, tucked in the
reindeer—skins at the sides, and we cuddled together on the
narrow seat, making every thing close and warm before we
set out. I could not see at all, when the door of the house
was shut and the horse started on the journey.

15. The night was dark, the snow blew incessantly, and
the dark ﬁr—trees roared all around us. Lars, however, knew
the way, and somehow or other we kept the beaten track.
He talked to the horse so constantly and so cheerfully, that
after a while my own spirits began to rise, and the way
seemed neither so long nor so disagreeable.

“ Ho there, Axel!” he would say. “ Keep the road,—
not too far to the left. Well done. Here’s a level 3 now
trot a bit.” H

XLI.—THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.

1. So we went on,--sometimes up hill, sometimes down
hill,e—for a long time, as it seemed. I began to grow chilly,
and even Lars handed me the reins, while he swung and
beat his arms to keep the blood in circulation._ He no
longer sang little songs and fragments of hymns, as when we
ﬁrst set out 5 but he was not in the least alarmed, or even
impatient. Whenever I asked (as I did about every ﬁve
minutes), “Are we nearly there?” he always answered, “A
little farther.”

2. Suddenly the wind seemed to increase.  

“ Ah,” said he, “ now I know where we are: it’s one mile
more.” But one mile, you must remember, meant seam.

Lars checked the horse, and peeredgaanxiously from side
to side in the darkness. I looked also, but could see
nothing. *

“ What is the matter? ” I ﬁnally asked. I

3. “We have got past the hills on the left,” he said.
“ The country is open to the wind, and here the snow drifts
worse than anywhere else on the road. If there have been
no plows out to-night we shall have trouble.”

X You must know that the farmers along the road are
obliged to turn out with their horses and oxen, and plow
down the drifts, whenever the road is blocked up by a storm.
! 4. In less than a quarter of an hour we could see that
the horse was sinking in the deep snow. He plunged brave~
ly forward, but made scarcely any headway, and presently
became so exhausted that he stood quite still. Lars and I
arose from the seat and looked around. For my part, I saw

was no sign of an opening through them. In a few minutes
the horse started again, and with great labor carried us a few
yards farther. ‘ I

5. “ Shall we get out and try to find the road?” said I.

“ It’s no use,” Lars answered. “ In these new drifts we
should sink to the waist. Wait a little, and we shall get
through this one.”

6. It was as he said. Another pull brought us through
the deep part of the drift, and we reached a place where the
snow was quite shallow. But it was not the hard, smooth
surface of the road ,' we could feel that the ground was un-
even, and covered with roots and bushes. Bidding Axel
stand still, Lars jumped out of the sled, and began wading
around among the trees. Then I got out on the other side,
but had not proceeded ten steps before I began to sink so
deep into the loose snow that I was glad to extricate myself
and return. It was a desperate situation, and I wondered
how we should ever get out of it.

7. I shouted to Lars, in order to guide him, and it was
“ If I knew
where the road is,” said he, “ I could get into it again. But
I "don’t know ,' and I think we must stay here all night.”

.“ We shall freeze to death in an hour! ” I cried. . I was
already chilled to the bone. The wind had made me very
drowsy, and I knew that if I slept I should soon be frozen.

him an armful of hay, and fastened the reindeer-skin upon his

LESSON II.

THE NAMES OF LETTERS ARE SELDOM THE SAME AS THEIR
SOUNDS.

In “spelling aloud” the words come, cat, call, care,
eorlf‘, you name 0-05 (See, Aye) as the first two letters of
each Word. So far, then, the spelling is the same for
all the Words. Yet, by this spelling, you do not once
utter the sozmol with which each Word begins. You say
See (0), and in doing so you hear ‘What sounds? Is either
of these the ﬁrst sound you hear when you pronounce
came? Then, too, on is the second sound of‘ only one of
-the ﬁve Words. Which one? When you “spell aloud,”
that is, when you name the letters, you do it without
regard to their sounds. Tee, Aitch, 0, Yew, Jee, Aitch,
do not sound Very much like the two sounds in though.
Indeed, 0 is the only letter that really has a sound in the
Word though.

In theselessons in Phonic Analysis, you are to think
What sound or sounds should be given in uttering a word.
Sometimes you will be asked to utter each sound sepa-
rately, and sometimes to Write such letters as have been
agreed upon to represent these sounds. It is Well for you
to remember that the ear, rather than the eye, is to assist
you in determining the sounds.

A Word is commonly Written with quite as many let-
ters as it has sounds; often, with more. In the Word am,
are there as many sounds as letters ? in this? thaw ? so ?
sew .? ooze? gohth2's2'e.? enoagh.? foes?

One reason Why there are more letters on a page than
there are sounds represented, is, that there are several
simple sounds in our language which are always repre-
sented by two letters. For example, We have no single

' letter that stands for the ﬁrst sound in the Word this. The

same is true of the words chiloi, show, when, mm. Two

10. Whenthis was done, Lars spread the remaining hay
evenly over the bottom of the sled and covered it with the
skins, which he tucked in very ﬁrmly on the side towards the

shuddered in the icy air 3 but the next moment I lay stretched
in the bottom of the sled, sheltered from the storm. I held

up the ends of the rein‘deer—skins while Lars took off his coat’

and crept in beside me. Then we drew the skins down and
pressed the hay against themy When the wind seemed‘ to
be ‘entirely excluded, Lars said we must pull off our boots,
untie our scarfs, and so loosen our clothes that they would
not feel tight upon any part of the body.

12. When this was done, and we lay close together, warm-
ing each other, I found that the chill gradually passed out of
my blood. My hands and feet were no longer numb ; a de-
lightful feeling of comfort crept over me 3 and I lay as snugly
as in the best bed. I -was surprised to ﬁnd that, although
my head was covered, I did not feel stifled. Enough air
came in under the skins to prevent us from feeling oppressed.

13. There was barely room for the two of us to lie, with
no chance of turning over or rolling about. In ﬁve minutes,
I think, we were asleep, and I dreamed of gathering peaches
on a warm August day, at home. In fact, I did not wake up
thoroughly during the night ; neither did pars; though it

’ 15. “There they are! ” cried Lars, and immediately be
gan to put on his boots, his scarf, and heavy coat. I did the
same, and by the time we were ready we heard shouts and
the crack of whips. We harnessed Axel to the sled, and pro-
ceeded slowly in the direction of the sounds, which came, as
we presently saw, from a company of farmers, out thus early
to plow the road. They had six pairs of horses geared to a
wooden frame, something like the bow ‘of a ship, pointed in
front and spreading out to a breadth of ten or’ twelve feet.

16. This machine not only cut through the drifts but packed
the snow, leaving a good, solid road behind it. After it had
passed, we sped along merrily in the cold morning twilight,
and in little more than an hour reached the post—house at
Umea, where we found Lars’s father prepared to return home.
He waited, nevertheless, until Lars had eaten a good warm
breakfast, when I said good-by to both, and went on toward
Lapland. 

17. Some weeks afterwards, on my return to Stockholm,
I stopped at the same little station. This time the weather
was mild and bright, and the father would have gone with
me to the next post—house ,- but I preferred to take my little
bedfellow and sled-fellow. He was so quiet and cheerful
and fearless, that, although I had been‘ nearly all over. the

a lesson from him, and might probably learn many more, if I
should know him better. We had a merry trip of two or
three hours, and then I took leave of Lars forever. He is

Shone round him o’er the dead.

2. Yet beautiful and bright he stood,

As born to rule the storm ;
A creature of heroic blood,

A proud, though child-like form.

3. The ﬂames rolled on—he would not go

Without his F ather’s word 3
That Father, faint in death below,

His Voice no longer heard.

THE FOURTH READERQ 151

4. He called aloud: ——“ Say, Father, say
If yet my task is done? ”
He knew not that the chieftain lay
Unconscious of his son. '

5. “ Speak, Father!” once again he cried, ‘ <

“ If I may yet begone X ”
And but the booming shots replied,
And fast the ﬂames rolled on.

6. Upon his brow he felt their breath,
And in his waving hair,
And looked from that lone post of death,
In still, yet brave despair.

“ My Father 1 must I stay ? ”
While o’er him fast, through sail and shroud,
The wreathing ﬁres made way.

8. They wrapt the ship in splendor wild,
They caught the flag on high,
And streamed above the gallant child,
Like banners in the sky.

9. There came a burst of thunder—-sound,--——«
The boy—-—oh! where was he?
Ask of the winds that far around
With fragments strewed the sea-—

That well had borne their part—--,
But the noblest thing which perished there
Was that young faithful heart.

REMARK.—Casabianca was a French naval ofﬁcer. He
was killed in the bloody battle of Aboukir, fought August I,
1798, between the English and French. His little son,
eleven years of , age, stood where his father had placed him,
on the deck of the ship L’Orient, until he was killed by the
blowing up of the ship.

XLIII.——THE RAIN.
HENRY w. LONGFELLOW.

How beautiful is the rain 2
After the dust and heat,

In the broad and ﬁery street,
In the narrow lane,

How beautiful is the rain 2

How it clatters along the roofs,

L Like the tramp of hoofs 1

How it gushes and struggles out

F r-om the throat of the overﬂowing spout S
Across the window pane

It pours and pours 3

And swift ‘and Wide,

With a muddy tide‘,

Like a river down the gutter roars

The rain, the welcome rain I

53. The sick man from his chamber looks

At the twisted brooks 5

He can feel the cool

Breath of each little pool ;

His fevered brain

Grows calm again,

And he breathes a blessing on the rain.

From the neighboring school
Come the boys

With more than their wonted noise
And commotion ;

And down the wet streets

Sail their mimic ﬂeets,

Till the treacherous pool

Engulphs them in its whirling

And turbulent ocean.

THE FOURTH READER. 153

. In the country, on every side,

Where far and wide,

Like 3. leopard’s tawny and spotted hide,
Stretches the plain,

To the dry grass and the drier grain,
How welcome is the rain!

. In the furrowed land

The toilsome and patient oxen stand ;
Lifting the yoke—encumbered head,
With their dilated nostrils spread,
They silently inhale

y The clover-scented gale,

And the vapors that arise

From the well-watered and smoking soil.
For this rest in the furrow after toil
Their large and lustrous eyes

Seem to thank the Lord,

More than man’s spoken word.

. Near at hand,

From under the sheltering trees,
The farmer sees p

His pastures and his ﬁelds of grain.
As they bend their tops

To the numberless beating drops

f the incessant rain,

He counts it as no sin

That he sees therein

Only hisvown thrift and gain.

. These and far more than these,

The poet sees!

He can behold

Aquarius old

Walking the fenceless ﬁelds of air;
And from each ample fold

Of the clouds about him rolled,
Scattering everywhere

ANALYTICAL SERIES.

The showery rain,
As the farmer scatters his grain.

. He can behold
Things manifold
That have not yet been wholly told,

Have not been wholly sung nor said,
For his thought that never stops,
Follows the water-drops

Down to the graves of the dead,
Down through chasms and gulfs profound,
To the dreary fountain head

Of lakes and rivers under ground ;
And sees them, when the rain is done,
_On the bridge of colors seven
Climbing up once more to heaven
Opposite the setting sun.

10. Thus the seer,

With vision clear,

Seesyforms appear and disappear,

In the perpetual round of change,
Mysterious change,

From birth to death, from death to birth,
From earth to heaven, from heaven to earth,
Till glimpses more sublime

. Of things, unseen before, _

Unto his wondering eyes reveal

The Universe, as an immeasurable wheel
Turning for evermore

The rapid and rushing river of Time.

 

  XLIV.—THE SONG or THE WATER.
EMILY. H. MILLER.

1. I know a green dingle, where, all the day long,
The waters go singing a wonderful song ;
Beneath the gray shadows, that tremble and glide,
Slips over the pebbles the shimmering tide.

THE FOURTH READER. 155

2. But when the faint twilight steals over the blue,
And evening comes softly with starlight and dew,
The song of the water grows clearer, and swells
To the chime and the tinkle of silvery bells.

3. The ferns in the sedges nod lightly, and wave
Like plumes on the conquering hosts of the brave,
And soft on the mosses fall footsteps that seem
To move to the musical bells of the stream.

4. 0 beautiful dingle! I know from your green
The breath of the autumn has faded the sheen ;
But over the pebbles, in shadow and sun,

The song of the water will never be done.

 

XLV.—NATURE’S JOKES.
GAIL HAMILTON.

1. Nature is fond of her little joke as well as the rest of us,
though the actors in the comedy do ‘not always discern the
comic element in it. Strange how ridiculous any thing may be,
and yet not have the smallest suspicion that it is ridiculous. As
when, for instance, one of these little “ bossy calves,” fumbling
and smelling around a chair, got his head between the rounds
of the lower part and could not get it out again.

2. He did not see the point of the joke at all, but stum-
bled about, shaking his head wildly, and wedging it in more

A ﬁrmly with every struggle. It was no easy matter to get near

enough to help him; and, in spite of his terror and impa-
tience of the situation, one could but laugh at the ﬁgure he
made.

3. I remember once seeing a pretty little yellow-bird on
the fence, looking as if he had three legs. A three—legged
bird! this must be attended to. I crept near enough to re-

_ solve the third leg into his tail, on which he had settled him-

self, leaning backward in a persistent determination to swal-
low a huge worm, which was just as persistently determined
not to be swallowed. Birdie gulped and wormie wriggled.

156 I ANALYTICAL seams.

Birdie looked very solemn, and wormie very angry. Birdie
would not give up and wormie would not go down. There
was a good deal of fun, but I had it all to myself.

4. Once -a caterpillar hung his cocoon to my window-sash,

W and I determined to keep my eye on him and see him begin

life as a butterﬂy. I watched him week after week without
detecting any change, and upon consulting the text books of
Natural History, found that he had probably reached middle

age, as butterﬂies count time, before I began to suspect he I

had been born at all.

5. But did the little sprite know I was watching him?
Did he creep out on the farther side, and shut the door behind
him carefully, and steal slyly around the corner of the house for
his wings to dry, and come peeping down from the roof every
day, laughing in his sleeve to see me watching that empty nest?
And did he tell the story to his friends at some butterﬂy din-
ner—party, and did they laugh at me till the tears ran from their
wicked little eyes, and say, in butterﬂy argon, what a “ sell ” it
was, and pat him on the shoulder, and call him “ a sad dog?”

 

XLVI.—HOW A PINE-TREE DID SOME GOOD.

SAMUEL W. DUFFIELD.

1. It was a long narrow valley where the Pine-Tree stood,
and perhaps if you went to look for it you might ﬁnd it there
to-day. For pine—trees live a long time, and this one was not
very old.

2. The valley was quite barren. Nothing grew there but
a few scrubby bushes, and, to tell the truth, it was about as
desolate a place as you can well imagine. Far up over it
hung the great, snowy caps of the Rocky Mountains, where

the clouds played hide and seek all day, and chased each

other merrily across the snow. There was a little stream,
too, that gathered itself up among the snows and came run-
ning down the side of the mountain 5 but, for all that, the Valley
was very dreary.

3. Once in a while there went a large gray rabbit hopping
among the sage-bushes 5 but look as far as you would, you

THE FOURTH READER. 157

would ﬁnd no more inhabitants. Poor, solitary little valley,
with not even a cottonwood down by the stream, and hardly
enough grass to furnish three oxen with a meal 1 Poor, bar-
ren little valley, lying always for half the day in the shadow of
those tall cliffs, burning under the summer sun, heaped high
with the winter snows,——lying there year after year without a
friend!

4. Yes, it had two friends, though they could do it but
little good, for they were two pine—trees. The one nearest
the mountain, hanging quite out of reach in a cleft of the rock,
was an old, gnarled tree, which had stood there for a hundred
years. The other was younger, with bright green foliage,
summer and winter. It curled up the ends of its branches, as
if it would like to have you understand that it was a very ﬁne,
hardy fellow, even if it wasn’t as old as its father up there in
the cleft of the rock.

5. Now this young Pine -Tree grew very lonesome at times,
and was glad to talk with any one who came along, and they
were few, I can tell you. Occasionally it would look lovingly
up ‘to the father—pine, and wonder if it could make him hear
what it said. It would rustle its branches and shout by the
hour, but he only heard it once, and then the words were so
mixed up withtfalling snow, that it was really impossible to
say what they meant. I

6. So the Pine—Tree was very lonesome, and no wonder.
“ I wish I knew of what good I a_m,” it said to the gray rab-
bit, one day. “ I wish I knew,—I wish I knew 5 ”~———and it
rustled its branches until they all seemed to say, “ Wish I
knew,—wish I knew.”

“ O, pshaw 1” said the rabbit. “ I wouldn’t concern my-

  self much about that. Some day you’ll ﬁnd out.”.

“ But do tell me,” persisted the Pine-Tree, “ of what good
you 2%z'7z,% I am.”

7. “Well,” answered the rabbit, sitting up on her hind
paws and washing her face with her front ones, so that com-
pany shouldn’t see her unless she looked trim and tidy,

, “well,” said the rabbit, “I can’t exactly say myself what it is.

If you don’t help one, you help another, and that’s right
enough, isn’t it? As for me, I take care of my family. I
hop round among the sage-bushes and get their breakfast,

LESSON III.

WRITING BY SOUND.

In the words came, cal, call, care, calf, no two of the
sounds denoted by the letter a are just alike. Each of the
diﬁerent sounds of a letter is sometimes called a power of
that letter. In our irregular way of spelling English words,

ey in they and eiglz in sleigh denote the sound which a g

has in came. The sound of a in call is represented in
cazzgiztr by aag/2., in pawn by aw, by an in azamnn, and by
0 in nor. We not only ﬁnd that seventeen of our letters
represent each from two to nine different sounds, but that
nearly every sound in the language is represented in two
or more ways. ._

In writing the following exercises, you are asked to
use one cizaracterfor each sounol, and always to denote
that sound by the same character. This is P/tonic writ-
ing,——writing in accordance with the sounds. .

There are forty-four sounds to be represented; and,
as our alphabet contains only twenty-six letters, several
new characters must be supplied or old ones must be
changed. The latter plan is followed in the Phonic
Chart (p-. 11).

U, Q, and ac do not appear in the Chart. VVe have
other ways of representing their powers, as in sacrzj/ice
(sakriﬁze), cent (sent), conquer (ker), fox (foks), exact
(egzakt). VVhat is the power of c, of q, andof m, as they
are used in aciel, excellence, conguer, axle, ocebec, exert?

LESSON IV.

THE “NAME vowELs,”——A, E, I, 0, AND U.

Mate, mete, mile, mote, mute. In each of these words,
except the last, the sound of the second letter is precisely
the same as the name of that letter; and even in mute,
the real sound of the second letter is heard as a part of its
name. Hence these ﬁve Vowels have been called name
vowels. They are also known as “long a,” “long e,”
“long 2',” “long 0,” and “long u.” A short horizontal
mark, called a enacron, is placed over a to denote
“long a,” over e to denote “long e,” and so on. In

dinner, and supper. [have plenty to do, I assure you, and
you must really excuse me now, for I have to be off.”

8. “ I wish I were a hare,” muttered the Pine-Tree to him-
self. “ I think I could do some good then, for I should have
a family to support, but I know I can’t now.”

9. Then he called across to the little stream and asked
the same question of him. And the stream rippled along,
and danced in the sunshine, and answered him, “I go on

errands for the big mountain all day. I carried one of your ,

cones not long ago to a point of land twenty miles off, and
there now is a pine—tree that looks just like you. But I must
run along, I am so busy. I can’t tell you of what good you are.
You must wait and see ” And the little stream danced on.‘

10. -“ I wish I were a stream,” thought the Pine-Tree.

“ Any thing but being tied down to this spot for years. That
is unfair. The rabbit can run around, and so can the stream ,-
but I must stand still forever. I wish I were dead!”

11. By and by the summer passed into autumn, and the
autumn into winter, and the snow—ﬂakes began to fall.
“ Halloo ! ” said the ﬁrst one, all in a ﬂutter, as she dropped
on the Pine-Tree. But he shook her ofﬁ and she fell still
farther down on to the ground. The Pine-Tree was getting
Very churlish and cross lately.

12. However, the snow didn’t stop for all that, and very
soon there was a white robe over the narrow valley. The
Pine-Tree had no one to talk with now. The stream had
covered himself in with ice and snow, and wasn’t to be seen.
The hare had to hop round very industriously to get enough
for her children to eat, and the sage—bushes were always low-
minded fellows, and couldn’t begin to keep up a ten minutes
conversation.

13. At last there came a solitary ﬁgure across the valley,
making its way straight for the Pine-Tree. I It was a lame
mule, which had been left behind from some wagon—train.
He dragged himself slowly on until he reached the tree. Now
the Pine, in shaking off the snow, had shaken down some
cones as well, and they lay on the snow. These the mule
picked up, and began to eat. ,

“ Heigh—ho ! ” said the tree, “ I never knew those things
were fit to eat before.”

THE FOURTH READER. 159

14. “ Didn’t you ?” replied the mule, “ Why, I have lived
on these things, as you call them, ever since I left the wagons.
I am going back on the Oregon trail, and I sha’n’t see you
again. Accept mythanks for breakfast. Good-by.” And
he moved off to the other end of the valley, and disappeared
among the rocks.

“ Well!” exclaimed the Pine-Tree, “that’s something, at
all events.” And he shook down a number of cones on the
snow. He was really happier than ever he had been before,
and with good reason, too.

XLVII.—THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.

1. After a while there appeared three people. They were
a family of Indians, a father, a mother, and a little child.
They, too, went straight to the tree. “ We’ll stay here,” said
the father, looking across at the snow—covered bed of the
stream, and up at the Pine—Tree. He was very poorly clothed,
this Indian. He and his wife and the child had on dresses
of hare skins, and they possessed nothing more of any ac-
count, exoept a bow and arrows, and a stick with a net on the
end. They had no lodge-poles, and not even a dog. They
were very miserable, and hungry.

2. The man threw down his bow and arrows not far from
the tree. Then he began to clear away the snow in a circle,
and to pull up the sage-bushes. These, he and the woman
built into a round, low hut, and then they lighted a ﬁre within
it. VVhile it was beginning to burn, the man went to the
stream, and broke a hole in the ice. Tying a string to his
arrow, he shot a ﬁsh which came up to breathe, and, putting
it on the coals, they all ate it half—raw. They never noticed
:he. Pine—Tree, though he rattled down at least a dozen more
‘-EOII‘?-S.

' 3. At last night came on, cold and cheerless. The wind
blew savagely through thevalley, and howled at the Pine-
Tree, for they were old enemies. 0, it was a bitter night!
but ﬁnally the morning broke. More snow had fallen, and
heaped up against the hut, so that you could hardly tell that

160 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

it was there. The stream had frozen tighter than before, and
the man could not break a hole in the ice again. The sage-
bushes were all hid by the drifts, and the Indians could ﬁnd
none to burn.

4. Then they turned to the Pine-Tree. How glad he was
to help them! They gathered up the cones, and roasted
the seeds on the ﬁre. They cut branches from the tree,
and burned them, and so kept up the warmth in their but.

5. The Pine-Tree began to ﬁnd himself useful, and he I

told the hare so, one morning, when she came along. But
she saw the Indians’ hut, and did not stop to reply. She
had put on her winter coatof white, yet the Indian had seen
her in spite of all her care. He followed her over the snow
with his net, and caught her among the drifts.

‘6. Poor Pine—Tree ! She was almost his only friend, and
when he saw her eaten, and her skin taken for the child’s
mantle, he was Very sorrowful, you may be sure. He saw
that, if the Indians stayed there, he too would have to die,
for they would in time burn off all his branches, and use all
his cones ; but he ,was doing good at last, and he was
content. I

7. Day after day passed by,——-some bleak, some warm,——

I and the winter moved slowly along. The Indians only went

from their hut to the Pine—Tree now. He gave them ﬁre and
food, and the snow was their drink. He was smaller than
before, for many branches were gone, but he was happier
than ever. '

8. One day the sun came out more warmly, and it seem-
ed as if spring was near. The Indian man broke a hole in
the ice, and got more ﬁsh. The Indian woman caught a
rabbit. The Indian child gathered sage—bushes from under
the fast-melting snow, and made a hotter ﬁre to cook the

east. And they did feast, and then they went away.

9. The Pine-Tree had found its mission. It had helped
to save three lives.

In the summer, there came along a band of explorers, and
one, the botanist of the party, stopped beside our Pine-Tree.
“ This,” said he, in his big words, “is the Pzkzus monopﬂyllzts,
otherwise known as the Bread Pine.” He looked at the de3
sertecl hut, and passed his hand over his forehead.

THE FOURTH READER. 161

10. “ How strange it is,” said he : “ this Pine-Tree must
have kept a whole family from cold and starvation last win-
ter. There are few of us who have done as much good as
that.” And ‘when he went away, he waved his hand to the
tree, and thanked God in his heart that it grew there. And
the Bread-Pine waved his branches in return, and said to
himself, as he gazed after the departing band, “ I will never
complain again, for I have found out what a pleasant thing it

is to do good, and I know now that every one in his lifetime
can do a little of it.” i

oi. L..—-LAWRENCE’S LESSON. 

J. T. TROWBRIDGE.

1. It was June when Lawrence came to the pond-side to
live. His uncle’s house stood on a high green bank ; and
his aunt gave him an attic room with a window that looked
out upon the water. The winding shores were fringed‘ with

ﬂags and willows, or overhung by shady groves 5 and all‘

around were orchards and gardens and meadows.‘

2. A happy boy was Lawrence, for he was passionately
fond of the water, and he had never lived so near a pond be-
fore. The scene from his window was never twice the same.

164 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

Sometimes the pond was like glass, mirroring the skyiand the
still trees. Sometimes light breezes swept over it, and sail-
boats rode the dancing waves. Then there were the eve-
nings, when clouds of the loveliest colors ﬂoated over it, and
the moon rose and silvered it ,- and the mornings, when all
the splendors of the new-risen sun were reflected into Law-
rence’,s chamber.

3. Whenever he had a leisure hour—-—for he went to school,
and worked in the garden-—he was to be seen rambling by
the shore, or rowing away in his uncleis boat ,° and he found
that the faithful performance of his tasks made’ his sports all
the sweeter to him.

_ 4. As children who play about the water are always in
more or less danger of falling into it, Lawrence’s uncle had
lost no time in teaching him to swim. “The ﬁrst thing for
you to learn,” said the doctor——for his uncle was a physician-«
“ is conﬁdence. Plunge your head under water.”

Lawrence did so, and came up with dripping hair and face,

gasping. The doctor made him repeat the exercise until he

i neither gasped nor choked.

5. “ That does not hurt you, does it? N 0. Neither will
it hurt you if you sink to the bottom, for you can hold your
breath ,- the water is shallow, and, besides, I am here to help
you. Now try to take a single stroke, just as the frogs do.
Throw yourself boldly off your feet, and don’t be afraid of
sinking.”

Lawrence, after considerable hesitation, tried the ex-
periment, and found that he could swim a single stroke, and

. come down upon his feet again without drowning. He tried
it again and again, delighted at his success.

6. “ That will do for this lesson,” said his uncle. “You
have been long enough in the water. Swimming is a ﬁne ex-
ercise for boys, and the bathing is good for them ,- but they
often make the mistake of staying too long in the water.
Especially at ﬁrst you must be careful ; after you get used to
it, you can stay in longer. Never go i.n when you are heated ,-
or if you do, come out again immediately, and continue ex-
ercising, so as to keep the pores of your. skin open.”

7. Lawrence learned, in his next lesson, to swim S two
strokes, and in a few days he could swim a rod. His uncle
then taught him how to dive.  

THE FOURTH READER. 165

“ You must avoid falling ﬂat on the water ; for if you do

so, from any great height, it will beat the breath out of your .

body almost as suddenly as if you struck a board. Learn to
keep your eyes open under the water. Some people’s nos-
trils are so large that the water gets into their heads when
they div-e ; if that is the case with yours, it will be well to
stuff a little cotton into them.” ,

8. Lawrence found no trouble of that kind. He was soon

able to dive, and pick up pebbles, and to swim beneath the ,

surface. His uncle then taught him how to save a drowning
person.

“ If he is still struggling, you must not let him get ‘hold of
you, or he will very likely cause you to drown with him. The

safest and readiest method is to pull him up by his hair. Be

sure and keep behind him as you bring him to the surface.
Do not try to do more than to lift his face out of water,
as you swim with him to the shore. The human body is so
light in the water that it may be supported at the surface by
a very slight effort 3 but it is hard to keep any portion of it
much above the surface.”

9. “ But what shall I do after I get him to the shore? ”
asked Lawrence.

“That is something very important to learn, which you
will very likely ﬁnd useful some day, if you live near this pond.
Three young people have been drowned in it within ﬁve
years, two of whom at least might have been saved from
death, had the persons with them known how to get

got them out.”

10. “ I wish you would teach me that, ” said the boy.

“ Very well ; I’ll give you apractical lesson before long.”

Accordingly, a few days afterwards, the doctor met Law-
rence and his companions as they were coming up from the
water, and, seizing his nephew, exclaimed, “ You have been
drowned, have you?”

“Not to my knowledge, ” said Ltmrrence laughing.

E11. “ Yes ; you fell from the boat just now, getting water
lilies. You know how to swim, but you got tangled among

the weeds, and were three minutes under water. You have i

just been ﬁshed out, and brought to shore. Lie down, sir,
for a drowned boy has no business on his feet. ”

12. Lawrence, who understood very well what his uncle
meant, dropped down on the grass, and tried to play the part
of a drowned person seriously ,- but he couldn’t help laughing,
and all the while he watched closely to see what was done
for him.

13. “ What shall we do, boys?” cried the doctor, “for
not a minute is to be lost.”

“ Carry him home, the ﬁrst thing, ” said Tim Hooper.

“ No, we haven’t time for that,—so many precious min-
utes would be wasted. ”

“ Put him in a warm bath, ” saidjake Thomas.

14. “ We could’nt do that without carrying him home, or
bringing the warm water to him. Besides, the warm bath is hurt-
ful under such circumstances. A person will drown quicker in
warm than in cold water. The reason seems to be, that cold
water strikes a chill into the blood, so that its circulation is
impeded, and less air is required for it in the lungs. The
blood goes to the lungs to throw off carbon, and to get oxy-
gen, which is breathed in with the air, of which you know it
is a part.

15. “When a person drowns, the supply of oxygen is out
off, and the carbonic acid, retained in the blood, poisons it.
A person in a swoon may live half an hour under water ,- for
his blood moves so slowly that -very‘ little oxygen is required
for it, and there is but very little carbon to be thrown off. Now
if we stimulate the circulation before we manage to get fresh
air into the lungs,—as we should do if we put him into a
warm bath,——you see we should increase the difficulty.”

16. “ The ﬁrst thing I would do would be to go for the
doctor,” said Lawrence.

“No, you wouldn’ t, for you are drowned, and have no
voice in the matter. Besides, I am ﬁve miles away, attend-
ing to a‘ boy who broke his leg falling from a beam in a
barn. But fortunately a boy comes up who has been told
what to do in such cases,——fortunately indeed, for already
too much time has been lost while we were considering what
to do, instead of doing it.

17. “This boy knows that the ﬁrst thing necessary is
fres/z air 2'72 #26 /zmgs. To make sure that the passage to the
lungs is open, he turns the patient on his face, in which

THE FOURTH READER. 167

position any water that may have lodged in his mouth and
throat, or any thing that may have risen from his stomach and
choked him, drops out.”

The doctor at the same time turned Lawrence on his face
to illustrate his method.

18. “ In this position, the tongue also falls forward, and
opens a passage to the windpipe. But sometimes the tongue is
so much swollen that it is necessary to put the ﬁnger on the
roots of it and press it forward. This should be looked to,
and where there is a hand to spare it will be well to keep the
tongue in place in that way. Act promptly and don’t be
afraid of hurting him. In this case, however, the tongue will
take care of itself. '

19. “- All this must be quickly done ; and the new-comer
hastens to make the patient gasp. He places him on his
side,——-thus. He rubs his forehead smartly, to bring warmth
and sensitiveness to the skin, then dashes cold water upon it.
If he has any snuff about him, or hartshorn, or spirits of any
kind, he applies them freely to the nostrils. But the drowned
boy does not gasp. Then what?”

“ Blow in my lungs,” said Lawrence.

20. “ But my own breath is exhausted of oxygen, and
charged with carbonic acid ,' and what we want is fresh air.
While one of the boys runs for the doctor, and another for
dry blankets, this is what the boy who knows does. He
loosens your clothes, then turns you down again upon your
face,—completely upon your breast,—with one wrist under
your forehead, thus, and passes his other hand with a gentle
pressure down your back. That compresses the lungs, and
drives the bad air out of them. Then he turns you again on
your side, and partly upon your back, in which position the
lungs open again of themselves and draw in fresh air.

2] . “ Repeat this process six or eight times a minute,—not
too often, for the low circulation requires but little air, and too
much cools the body. What we want now is to keep the body
warm, and excite circulation. As soon as we have got the
artiﬁcial breathing started, we strip off all the wet clothes 5

1. “ How long will it take to bring me to?” Lawrence
anxiously inquired.

“ That depends upon how thoroughly drowned you were.
I should not give you up for an hour 5 but I should not have
much hope of you, if I could perceive no movement of the
heart, by putting my ear to it, after a quarter of an hour. In
ﬁve or ten minutes I should expect you to make a little gasp ;
and after that I should consider you safe.

2. “ Now, boys,” the doctor continued, “remember that,
as long as nothing is done to put fresh air into the lungs of a

drowned person, it is just the same for him as if he remained ’

all that while in the water. So you must be prepared to do
all these things with the utmost promptitude.”

He then made them take little Tim Hooper, and go
through all the movements with him, as he had done
with Lawrence, and repeat the process until they were perfect

 it.

THE FOURTH READER. 169

3. “ If this were taught in every school the children of
which live or play near a pond or river,” he said, “ more than
half the cases of actual death from drowning might be pre»
Vented.”

The boys laughed, and thought the lesson more a good
joke than any thing else. They little expected ever to prac-=
tice. it. But now see how useful a little knowledge some—
times proves.

December came, and the pond froze over. So thin, how»
ever, was the coating of ice that but few boys ventured to go
upon it.  

4. “ Wait, my boy, a day or two, until the ice is stronger.”
said the doctor. “ Nothing will be lost by waiting 5 but much
will be risked by attempting toskate to-day.”

So Lawrence, not without some mutterings of discontent,
I am sorry to say, restrained his eagerness to strap on the
new skates his uncle had given him, and remained on the shore,
watching those who did skate.

5. Suddenly a boy fell, and, in falling, he broke the ice
and went in 3 and, in struggling to get out, he slipped under

the ice. It was Jake Thomas, one of the boys who had

learned the lessonwith Lawrence. How little did he imag-
ine, when he laughed at it, that the time would so soon come
for it to be practiced on him.‘

6. “ Boy drowned! Boy drowned!” was the cry ; and the

skaters ﬂew to the rescue.
Lawrence knew that, under such circumstances, his uncle
would approve of his going upon the ice, and he started to

Q run to ]ake’s assistance. But he had scarcely left the shore

when he saw the ice give way again, under the weight of two

‘skaters who approached the broken place. There were now

three boys in the water.

7. “ This won’t do,” thought he 3 and he ran back to the,

shore. There was a man at work, preparing some hot-beds,
in a garden near by. He had already heard the alarm.
“ Bring planks ! a rake !’,’ cried Lawrence.

He seized one of the broad board coverings of the beds,

"and shoved it out before him on the ice. The man followed

with another hot-bed cover, and a long-handled garden rake.
8

l?O ANALYTICAL SERIES.

Nothing had yet been done for Jake, who _had not been seen
since he went down. '

8. Other skaters had arrived 3 but they were engaged in
trying to rescue the two boys who had fallen in after him. It
was perilous business. The ice was bending and cracking
under them, and they could not reach the edge of it without
breaking in like the others. Fortunately, both boys could
swim, and they were sustaining themselves by holding on to

coats thrown to them over the edge of the ice. Thus far, at_

every attempt to get out, they had only broken the ice still more.
9. Lawrence pushed his board close up to the broken

place, and, lying ﬂat on his breast upon it, looked down into i

the clear cold water. He could have seen the bottom, but
for the. ﬂoating fragments of thin ice, and the ripples formed
by the two boys trying to get out.

10. “ Keep still I keep still 1” he cried ; but that was not
easy for two boys in their position to do. As long as the
light reﬂected from the waves danced in his sight, he could
see nothing under them. So he plunged his face into the
water, with his eyes open. Banzai/z the surface, they could
see very well. And there, lying upon the bottom, in about
ten feet of water, clinging fast to some weeds, with his red
tippet on his neck and his skates on his feet, was Jake
Thomas.

1]. He was directly under the ice Lawrence was on. The
plunged face came dripping out of the cold water. “The
rake I ” the man handed it to Lawrence, who thrust it into the
water, and hooked one of the teeth into ]ake’s tippet, and
drew him quickly and steadily up.

The broad board distributed the pressure of his weight
over so large a surface of the ice that it did not break, even
when he pulled the drenched and lifeless body out.

12. The situation on the ice being unsafe and awkward,
the body was quickly slid ashore on the board, and taken to
the gardener’s house, which was close by the pond. With

the other board that had been brought, the other two skaters

were speedily rescued ; and Lawrence had nothing to do but
to think of fake and his uncle’s lesson.

13. “ I shouldn’t have stopped to bring him to the house,
he said afterwards, “ but Peter insisted on it.”

THE FOURTH READER. 171

Arrived at the house, however, Peter, who was ignorant
as an owl of what should be done in the case, left all to the
boy. 1
“ 0 yes ! roll him I "’ said he, “I’Ve heard that was good,-—
to get the water out of him.”

14. Lawrence did not stop to explain that the rolling pro»
cess was not to get the water out, for none could enter the
lungs, but to get the air in. He worked vigorously, accord-
ing to his uncle’s directions. Meantime his uncle was sent
for 3 but he _was not at home.

15. Laid out on Peter’s kitchen—table, his wet clothes

‘ removed, his limbs wrapped in warm blankets, and several

persons smartly slapping and rubbing them, according to
Lawrence’s»directions, while Lawrence himself, with Peter’s
assistance, rolled him from his breast to his side, and over
again upon his breast,—this was the situation in which the
drowned boy’s mother found him, when, having heard the

terrible news, she came running to Peter’s house.

16. But the peril was now nearly over. Jake had gasped
slightly once or twice. Then came the agony of recovering
consciousness, in the midst of which the doctor arrived. It
was then half an hour from the time when Jake broke through
the ice, and it was evident to all, that, if nothing had been
done for him all that while, his recovery would have been
impossible. 1

17. “Well done! well done!” cried the doctor. _ “You
have made good use of my lesson, boy! Woman, your child
is saved.”

The hearty praise of his uncle, the joy of the mother, and
his own consciousness of having done a good action, made
this the happiest day of Lawrence’s life.

F ORTUNE.

OUR YOUNG FOLKS.

1. My friend Jacques went into a balzeris shop one day
to buy a little cake which he had fancied in passing. He
intended it for a child whose appetite was gone, and who
could be coaxed to eat only by amusing him. He thought
that such a pretty loaf might tempt even the sick. ‘While he
waited for his change, a little boy six or eight years old, in
poor but perfectly clean clothes, entered the baker’s shop.
“Ma’am,” said he to the baker’s wife, “ mother sent me for a
loaf of bread.” The woman climbed upon the counter (this
happened in a country town), tool: from the shelf of four»
pound loaves the best one she could find, and put it into the
arms of the little boy,

2., My friend Jacques then ﬁrst observed the thin and
thoughtful face of the little fellow, It contrasted strongly
with the round, open countenance of the great loaf; of which
he was taking the greatest care, J

“ Have you any money?” said the baker’s wife;

The little boy’s eyes grew sad,

3,. “ No rna’am,” said he, hugging the loaf closer to his

A thin blouse ; “ but mother told me to say that she would come

and speak to you about it to=morrow,”

“Run along,” said the good woman ; “ carry your bread
home, child?’ .

“ Thank you, rna’am,” said the poor little fellow.

4. My friend Jacques came forward for his money, He

, had put his purchase into his pocket, and was about to go,

when he found the child with the big loaf, whom he had
supposed to be half-way home, standing stock-=sti11 behind him.
“What are you doing there?” said the baker’s wife to the

17 6 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

child, whom she also had thought to be fairly off. “ Don't
you like the bread?”

'5. “ 0, yes, ma’am 1” said the child.

“Well, then, carry it to your mother, my little friend. If
you wait any longer, she will think you are playing by the

-way, and you will get a scolding.”

The child did not seem to hear. Something else absorb
ed his attention.

6. The baker’s wife went up to him, and gave him a*

friendly tap on the shoulder. “ What are you thinking
about? ” said she.
“Ma’am,” said the little boy, “ what is it that sings? ”
“ There is no singing,” said she. ,
“ Yes,” cried the little fellow. “ Hear it ! Queek, queek,

V queek, queek 3. ’

7. My friend and the woman both listened, but they could
hear nothing, unless it was the song of the crickets, frequent
guests in bakers’ houses.

“ It is a little bird,” said the dear little fellow, “ or per
haps the bread sings when it bakes, as apples do.”

8. “ No, indeed, little gooseyl ” said the baker’s wife ;
“those are crickets. They sing in the bakehouse because
we are lighting the oven, and they like to see the ﬁre.”

“Crickets l ” said the child 3 “ are they really crickets ?”

“Yes, tobe sure,” said she. The child’s face lighted up.

9. “ Ma’am,” said he, blushing at the boldness of his re-
quest, “ I would like it very much if you would give me a
cricket.”

“ A cricket!” said the baker’s wife, smiling, “what in the
world would you do with a cricket, my little friend? I would
gladly give you all there are in the house, to get rid of them,
they run about so.”

10. “O ma’am, give me one, only one, if you please!”
said the child, clasping his little thin hands under the big
loaf. “ They say that crickets bring good luck into houses ;
and perhaps if we had one at home, mother, who has so much
trouble, wouldn’t cry any more.”   y

11. “Why does your poor mamma cry? ” said my friend,
who could no longer help joining in the conversation.

“ On account of her bills, sir,” said the little fellow. “ Fa-

ther is dead, and mother works very hard, but she can not
pay them all.”

12. My friend took the child, and with him the great loaf,
into his arms, and I really believe he kissed them both.
Meanwhile, the baker’s wife, who did not dare to touch a
cricket herself, had gone into the bakehouse. She made her
5.-husband catch four, and put them into a box with holes in
‘the cover, so that they might breathe. She gave the box to
the child, who went away perfectly happy.

13. When he had gone, the baker’s wife and my friend
gave each other a good squeeze of the hand. “ Poor little
fellow,” said they, both together. Then she took down her
account book, and, ﬁnding the page where the mother’s
charges were written, made a great dash all down the page,
and then wrote at the bottom, “Paid.”

14. Meanwhile my friend, to lose no time, had put up in
paper all the money in his pockets, where fortunately he had
quite a sum that day, and had begged the good wife to send
it at once to the mother of the little cricket boy, with her bill
receipted, and a note, in which he told her she had a son who
would one day be her joy and pride. ,

15. They gave it to a baker’s boy with long legs, an_d
told him to make haste. The child, with his big loaf, his
four crickets, and his little short legs, could not run very fast,

- so that, when he reached home, he found his mother for the

ﬁrst time in many weeks with her eyes raised from her work,
and a smile of peace and happiness upon her lips. A

16. The boy believed that it was the arrival of his four
little black things which had worked this miracle, and I do
not think he was mistaken. Without the crickets, and his

H   good little heart, would this happy change have taken place

in his mother’s fortune P

LVI.-—-DAILY WORK.

CHARLES MACKAY.

L Who lags from dread of daily work,
And his appointed task would shirk,
Commits a folly and a crime ,-
A soulless slave————
A paltry knave-—

A clog upon the wheels of time.
With work to do, and store of health
The man’s unworthy to be free,

‘Who will not give,
That he may live,
His daily toil for daily fee,
2. No I let us work ! We only ask
Reward proportioned to our task ;
We have no quarrel with the greatm
No feud with rank-—
With mill or bank——
No envy of a lord’s estate.
if We can earn sufficient store‘ ‘
To satisfy our daily need,
And can retain,
For age and pain,
A fraction, We are rich indeed.

THE FOURTH READER   18}

3. No dread of toil have we or ours ;
We know our worth, and weigh our powers ,;
The more we work, the more we win :
Success to trade! “
Success to spade!
And to the corn that’s coming in l
And joy to him who, o’er his task,
Remembers toil is nature’s plan
Who, working, thinks,
And never sinks
His independence as a MAN !

4. Who only asks for humblest wealth,
Enough for competence and health,
And leisure, when his work is done.
To read his book,
By chimney nook,
Or stroll at setting of the sun-—
VVho toils as every man should toil,
For fair reward, erect and free 3
These are the men--«
The best of men—-
These are the men we mean to be.

 

LVII.——LAST DAY.

GAIL HAMILTON.

1. Not the last day that ever will be, but the last day of
school. What you call “ examination day,” that the little
people of Applethorpe called “last day.” And a great day
it was,—comm1ttee 111 school, fathers and mothers, ever-
greens, best clothes, “ speaking pieces,” and rewards of merit.
0, there was a great deal to be done! so Jack and Gerty
and Trip went over to where Parke and Huldah and Moses
and Susan and Lina lived, to see about. it. It was evening,
and, though their house was nearly a mile away, Jack was as
brave as a lion, and Gerty and Trip as fearless as cubs un-
der his wing',——only cubs do not go under wings, I believe.

182 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

2. Trip had private ends in view in accompanying her
brother and sister. She was extremely interested in .“last
day,” but she did not care to hear their tiresome talk about
ways and means. Nobody ever listened to her, or if they
did, it was only to. laugh ,' but Lina and she could go away
and play by themselves. She would have liked to carry both
her dolls. I may as well tell you that her dolls were just
rag—babies. *  '

3. Mary Maria, the elder, was a very well grown young ~

woman, about as tall as your arm, and too heavy for Trip’s
arms 3 so Miss Mary Maria was forced to stay at home, al-‘
though she had been arrayed for the visit in a cloak made of
an old bonnet-lining, which garment Trip, who was of an as-
piring as well as an ingenious ‘mind, had digniﬁed with the
l1igh—sounding appellation of “ white-satin-saratoga—half—man-
-tilla-belzerette ” ! The other was Charles Emilus, until Trip
had a teacher whom she liked very much, and for whom she
refchristened her son Emilus Alvah.

4. Trip loved both her children alike, especially Emilus
Alvah. He was much smaller than Mary Maria, being only
about a third as tall as your arm, and he had trunkfuls of (
clothes. He had a little yellow plush great—coat, with a cape
and velvet collar, and a blue silk cap with a visor——-do you
call it ?——as nice a cap as ever you saw. Gerty made those.
Gerty did all the extra tailoring, and Trip did the plain sew-
ing. She made him little pink trousers, with embroidered

white muslin ones over them, and little silk jackets, for party

wear, and she hem—stitched all his collars. .

5. He had school clothes, and meeting clothes, and
rainy—day clothes ; indeed, he had clothes on the slightest
provocation. All his trousers were plaited at the waist, and
stitched down as nicely as if he had been a real boy ,- and he
had pins stuck into him wherever buttons ought to be ; be-
cause the heads, you know, looked just like buttons. As
Trip’s dolls led a very active life, they naturally wore out
often and had to be renewed. It was no great matter, for
their legs and arms were only pieces of cloth rolled up and
sewed, and then fastened to a body full of bran‘ or cotton
wool, with a string tied tightly around where the waist and
the throat ought to be, and eyes, nose, and mouth inked into
the face by Jack or Gerty.

THE FOURTH READER. 183

6. Nevertheless, Trip was very fond of heryoung family,

and undressed and put them to bed every night as regularly
as she went to bed herself 3' therefore, when their faces grew
hopelessly dirty, and their poor little bodies and limbs burst
open beyond all possibility of repair, and. she had to give
them up and make new ones, she could not help celebrating
their obsequies with a few secret tears. It does not seem to
me that our young folks love their dolls half as much as these
young folks did. But how long I am lingering over Trip’s
dollsi Pardon me! When people get into years they are
apt to grow garrulous. Do you -know what that means?
Never mind. ~

7. So Trip took Emilus Alvah and a traveling—bag of his
clothes over to Lina’s, and they went into a little bedroom that
opened out of the great kitchen where the others were, and
enjoyed themselves and their play just as much as Trip ex-
pected, though she had one disappointment, for in the midst
of their play Lina jumped up, shut the door cautiously, opened
the lid of a big old wooden chest, and beckoned Trip to look.

, Trip ran to her, and Lina dug down nearly to the bottom, and

unearthed a clean crash towel, which, being unfolded, dis-
played a pile of beautiful bulky, ﬂaky mince turn—overs, of the
shape and about the size of the half-moon in the sky.

8. Now if Trip law’ a weakness, it was for mince turn-
overs. Besides being mince, they had so much crust, and
these in particular were of such royal dimensions, that they
quite turned her head. Not unnaturally she concluded that
they were going to be set forth in her and Jack and Gerty’s
honor ; but the minute-hand kept going, and the clock kept

I striking, and that one speedily dissolving View was the last

she ever got of the mammoth turn—overs. However, she with
the others had “ refreshments” of baked apples and milk,
which was a great deal better for them ; though here again
Trip was not in luck, for no sooner had she tasted her brim-
ming bowl than she exclaimed in dismay, “ 0, it’s new milk 1”

9. “Yes 5 don’t you like new milk?” asked Hu1dah’s

. mother.

“ Yes, m‘a’am,”, said Trip quickly, smothering her disrel-
ish, and permitting her instinct of politeness to get the mas-

tery over her instinct of truth 3 for she had a great dislike to"

184: ANALYTICAL SERIES.

new milk, or “No I have n’t either,” she said to her con-
science. “ It is ze/arm milk, not new milk, that I don’t like ;
so I didn’t tell a lie.” If you would not get into Trip’:,
trouble, you must not speak out so quickly as Trip. Just
say nothing as long as you can, and when you do speak,
speak the truth.

10. As the result of their deliberations, the girls were all
set to making roses out of pink tissue—paper, and the boys
went down into the swamps and woods after evergreen, and
the girls kept saying to Trip, “Don’t touch this!” “Don’t
spoil that 1” “ Don’t come here! ”—so she betook herself
cheerily to the swamps and the boys, and they cried, “ Look
out, Trip-hammer, you’ll slump through!” when she immedi~
ately “slumped through ; ” and after she had scrambled upon
thicker ice, and slipped down half a dozen times, somebody
would call, "Trip-up, you’ll fall if you don’t mind.”  

11. By and by a very sad thing happened ; for Asel, high
up on a tree after boughs, was too heavy for the branch he

stood on, and down it came, bringing him with it. He did

not break his leg, but he might as well while he was about it,
for it doubled under him, and was sadly wrenched, so that he
had to be carried home and keep his bed ,- and Tripcried
very hard, for she was very fond of Asel, as she was indeed
of nearly every one who took the least notice of her, and if
they took none it was all the same. But never went she into
2‘/tat swamp again as long as she lived.

12. And the old school—house was all festooned with ground-
pine, and hung with hemlock and spruce, and gay with roses,
and the children went to school in their best clothes for the
“last day.” Gerty and'Trip had new muslin-delaine dresses,
with little plaits on the waist, and little lace ruffles on the
throat,—-very fresh and pretty, though Trip’s had had a nar-
row escape , for when she went to the dressmaker’s for her
dress, her aunt called and asked her to take home a milk-can
almost as large as she was herself. It was empty and light,
but rather unwieldy for Trip ,' so, to simplify matters, she just

, tucked her new dress intothe milk—can and forgot all about it.

13. And next morning, when the milk went in,'it did not
rattle quite as much as usual, because Trip’s new dress was
soft! But the dress was speedily taken out and well shaken,

THE FOURTH READER. 185 K

and Trip well scolded, which she did not mind at all 3 and
when the dress was on, you never would’ have suspected it
had passed the night in a milk-can, or taken a milk—bath in
the morning. “And where’s the harm?” said Jack 3 “people
have watered silks. Why should n’t they have milked ’al~a-
pack-ahs ? ” Stupid Jack, who called all sorts of girls’ cloth
,“al-.a-pack—ah,” ﬁrst misspelling the word and then mispro~
nouncing it with great rapidity.

14. Also Gerty and Trip had beautiful black—silk aprons,
made expressly for “last day” out of their grandmother’s
cape, as good as new, and new polka-boots, bought a fortnight
before, which Trip had taken out of her drawer every day
Since and held up admiringly with one hand, while the other
held a pair of nice little embroidered pantalets above them,
thus feasting beforehand on the splendor that should be.
When she was dressed, she asked Jack conﬁdentially, did he
think she looked as nice as Lina and Cicely and Meg and
Olive would look, and Jack would like to see the fellow that
could hoe their row with Trip and Gerty, sir! Whereat Trip
laughed to the very bottom of her silly little heart, and trotted
off» to school well pleased.

LVIII.—THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.

1. I have not space to tell you how brilliantly successful
this last day proved to be,——how the committee and the parents
poured in and ﬁlled the rooms, and crowded the large schol-
ars into the low seats, and the little scholars into no seats at

' all ; how they read and spelled in loud shouts, and the louder

they shouted the better every body was pleased ; what long
“ sums” they did on ‘the blackboard, what heroic orations
they uttered, what magniﬁcent writing-books they showed, all
gay with German text, and how the happy parents congratu-
lated themselves and each other on having children so prom;
ising. But Trip had a special triumph which I must not fail

A to record.

2. To be sure she was in high spirits all day,—-—as who
could help being with a new delaine dress and polka boots?

186' L ANALYTICAL SERIES.

She answered every question which was asked her, read with-
out any failure, and came off conqueror in a discussion with
the head committee—man ; for when a class was reciting from
some child’s book of philosophy, he tried to puzzle them by
asking which would weigh the most, a pound of lead or a
pound of feathers ? Some said the lead, but Trip answered
decidedly, “Both alike ; ” and then all the company smiled,
Trip was so little. T

3. “ And which would fall to the ground soonest, if you ~

should let them drop?”

“ Both alike,” said Trip again ,' and then they smiled again.

“ 0 no,” said the committee—man ,- “the feathers would
ﬂoat about and be a long while getting down.”

“ N 0 they would n’t,” persisted Trip eagerly, “if they were
tied up just as tight ,- ” and then every body laughed outright,
the committee—man hardest of all, and Trip was quite fright-
ened at having “ spoken right out in meeting.”

4. And after the committee were gone, and the master
had made his farewell address and delivered his “ rewards of
merit,” he called up little Trip and put into her hands two
cents, which he said Mr. Church, a strange gentleman who
had been present, "had desired him to give her. And you
can imagine how Jack and Gerty and Trip gloried in it, and
how all the children crowded around after school to look at
the cents as they lay hot and coppery in her eager little list.

5. Then there was great stir and jollity in gathering up

their goods and chattels for the three months: vacation. ’

Trip’s treasures consisted of a lovely pasteboard horse which
Eldred had given her,——Eldred and she were great friends.
It had an extraordinarily long tail, and a hardly less wonder-
ful head, and it stood on nothing in a very spirited manner.
There was a busk which Nathan had made for her,———Nathan
and she were intimate also. You don’t know what a busk
is? \Well, sometimes it is whalebone, and sometimes it isn’t,
and whatever it is, it is of no earthly use. This was one of
the z3"7z’2‘s, for it was made of white-wood polished, and with
little ﬁgures pricked all over it.

6. There was a ball, India rubber, with a bright cover-
ing, which George gave her, for George and she were
on the best of terms 5 and a medal which Benjamin gave her

on this wise. He brought it to school one day and dis-
played it, black and bulging, with a bright pewter rim, a
white log-cabin on one side, and a head. of Harrison on the
other. -It went from hand to hand until it got to Trip.
“ Whose is it ? ” asked Olive, just coming in. Trip told her,
and she immediately rushed to Benjamin to beg him to give
it to her. “ It is n’t mine,” said Benjamin carelessly, sticking
his ack—knife into the desk.

7. Olive came back and reported, and just then the mas-
ter came and school began 3 and little Trip pondered
within herself what it could mean, and shrewdly guessed he
meant to give it to her. So as soon as school was done she
held it out to him with a beating heart, and he said “ Tis n’t
mine, it ’s yours” ; and Trip put it into her pocket and never
told Olive. And now little Benny sleeps in the China Sea.
If you wish to know why they befriended Trip in so knightly
a fashion, I can tell you, I think it was because she would
have been in an evil case if she had not been befriended.

8. It was because she was such a ridiculous little puss ;
because her adventurous and rebellious hair was always
blowing about over her sunburnt little face ; because she
was always running into places where she had no business to
be, and took snubbings so sweetly, never even knowing that she
was snubbed ; because she was perpetually tumbling down
on her nose and making it bleed, and tumbling down on her
forehead and bumping little black and yellow mounds all over
it, and tumbling on the back of her head and being stunned,
and pitching under the horses, and bruising her hands, and
getting her wrists cut, and setting her clothes on ﬁre,—
in short, wherever there was any thing going on, especially if

i it was mischief or danger, therein was Trip sure to poke her

pug nose in a manner most trying to Gerty, who acted as
surgeon-‘general, and never had any peace except when Trip
was sick, and had to stay at home from school a day. So_
you see it was very fortunate that the big boys turned their
gentle side to her ; for if they had been as merciless as she

A was to herself there is no knowing what would have become

of her.

A Syllable is either a Word, or such a part of a Word,
as is spoken with a single effort or impulse ofvoice. The
Word mil is a syllable, because, in speaking it, the voice
makes but one spring; so is the Word read. "What is a
word of one syllable called? In pronouncing the Word

make ? VVhat is a ctissyllable .9 a polysyllabte .9

Are all the syllables of the word lV0vembe7~ spoken
with equal loudness ? Whicli syllable of the word neglect
is spoken more loudly than the other ‘.9 which syllable of

and calling out now and then, “ Trip, what’s in your hand? ”
“ Who ’s got any money to lend?” “ Trip, are n’t you going
to treat? ” “ Trip give us an oyster supper, there’s a good
girl.” But Trip was not good girl enough for that. She
clutched close her two cents, displayed them to her admiring
parents, and then put them into her little pitcher, and kept
them there till she took them out, and then she lost them.
“ Though lost to sight, to memory dear,”

. He is crossing o’er the wold apace,

He is stronger than the storm ,
He does not feel the cold, not he,

His heart it is so warm 3 .
For father’s heart is stout and true
As ever human bosom knew.

. He makes all toil, all hardship light;

Would all men were the same !
So ready to be pleased, so kind,

So very slow to blame!
Folks need not be unkind, austere,
For love hath readier will than fear.

.1 Nay, do not close the shutters, child ;

For far along the lane
The little window looks, and he

Can see it shining plain ;
I’Ve heard him say he loves to mark
The cheerful ﬁrelight through the dark.

. And We’ll do all that father likes,

His wishes are so few’;
Would they were more 3 that every hour
Some wish of his I knew ;
I am sure it makes _a happy day,
When I can please him any way.

. I know he’s coming by this sign,

That baby’s almost wild ;
See how he laughs and crows and stares,—--
Heaven bless the merry child!
He’s father’s self in face and limb,
And father’s heart is strong in him.

. Hark! hark ! I hear his footsteps now,

He’s through the garden gate ;
Run, little Bess, and ope the door,

And do not let him wait ;
Shout, baby shout! and clap thy hands,
For father on the threshold stands.

On her pillow as she lay,
Heard a robin, loud and clear,
Sing, the chamber window near. a

Did not stir nor speak a word,
Happy thus to hear him sing,
Thinking, now it would be spring,—«»-

Smiling, that ere long she should
Hunt for violets in the wood.

Without rambles in the grove,
Such as eager children love.

1. And in the frosty season, when the sun

Was set, and, visible for many a mile,

The cottage-windows through the twilight blazed,
I heeded not the summons : happy time

It was indeed for all of us 3 for me

It was a time of rapture! Clear and loud

The village clock tolled six-——I wheeled about, .
Proud and exulting, like an untired horse

That cares not for his home.—All shod with steel
We hissed along the polished ice, in games
Confederate, imitative of the chase '
And woodland pleasures,~——the resounding horn,-an
The pack loud-chiming, and the hunted hare.

And not a voice was idle : with the din

Of melancholy, not unnoticed 3 while the stars,
Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west
The orange sky of evening died away.

LXIII.—HOW THE INDIAN CORN GROWS.

OUR YOUNG FOLKS.

1. The children came in from the ﬁeld with their hands
full of the soft, pale-green corn—si1k. Annie had rolled hers
into a bird’s—nest, while Willie had dressed his little sister’s
hair with the long, damp tresses, until she seemed more like
a mermaid, with pale blue eyes shining out between the locks
of her sea—green hair, than like our own Alice.

2. They brought their treasures to the mother, who sat on
the door-step of the farm—house, under the tall, old el1n—tree
that had been growing there ever since her mother was a
child. She praised the beauty of the bird’s nest, and kissed
the little mermaiden to ﬁnd if her lips tasted of salt water;
but then she said, “ Don’t break any more of the silk, dear
children, else we shall have no ears of corn in the ﬁeld,——-
none to roast before our picnic ﬁres, and none to dry and
pop at Christmas time next winter.”

3. Now the children wondered at what their mother said,
and begged that she would tell them how the silk could
make the round, full kernels of corn. And this is the story
that the mother told, while they all sat on the door-step under
the old elm.

4. “When your father broke up the ground with his plow,
and scattered in the seed—corn, the crows were watching from
the old apple-tree ; and they came down to pick up the corn 3
and indeed they did carry away a ' good deal ; but the days
went by, the spring showers moistened the earth, and the
sun shone, and so the seed—corn swelled, and, bursting open,

. thrust out two little hands, one reaching down to hold itself

ﬁrmly in the earth, and one reaching up to the light and the
air. _

THE FOURTH READER. 197

5. “ The ﬁrst was never very beautiful, but certainly quite
useful ; for, besides holding the corn ﬁrmly in its place, it
drew up water and food for the whole plant 3 but the second
spread out two long, slender green leaves, that waved with
every breath of air,‘ and seemed to rejoice in every ray of
sunshine. Day by day it grew taller and taller, and by and
by put out new streamers broader and stronger, until it stood
higher than Willie’s head ; then, at the top, came a new kind
of bud, quite different from those that folded the green
streamers, and when that opened, it showed a nodding ﬂower
which swayed and bowed at the top of the stalk like the
crown of the whole plant.

6. “And yet this was not the best that the corn plant
could do,—for lower down, and partly hidden by the leaves,
it had hung out a silken tassel of pale, sea—green color, like
the hair of a little mermaid. Now, every silken thread was
in truth a tiny tube, so ﬁne that our eyes cannot see the bore
of it.

7. “The nodding ﬂower that grew so gayly up above
there was day by day ripening a golden dust called pollen,
and every grain of this pollen—and they were ‘very small
grains indeed—knew perfectly well that the silken threads
were tubes 3 and they felt an irresistible desire to enter the
shining passages and explore them to the very end 3 so one
day, when the wind was tossing the whole blossoms this way
and that, the pollen-grains danced out, and, sailing down
on the soft breeze, each one crept in at the open door of a
sea-green tube. . i

8. “ Down they slid over the shining ﬂoors, and what

was their delight to find, when they reached the end, that
they had all along been expected, and for each one was a_

little room prepared, and sweet food for their nourishment ;
and from this time they had no desire to go away, but re-
mained each in his own place, and grew every day stronger
and larger and rounder, even as Baby in the cradle there,
who has nothing to do but grow.

, 9. “ Side by side were their cradles, one beyond another
in beautiful straight rows; and as the pollen-grains grew
daily larger, the cradles also grew for their accomodation,
until at last they felt themselves really full of sweet, delicious

from the opening of the dry leaves which wrapped them all
together, and saw a little boy with his father coming through
the cornﬁeld, while yet every thing was beaded with dew, and
the sun was scarcely an hour high. The boy carried a bas-
ket, and the father broke from the corn-stalks the full, ﬁrm.

10. “ O Mother 1 ” cried Willie, “ that was father and I.

We must have taken that very ear ; for I remember how the

LXV.——THE INEQUALITIES or FORTUNE.
GAIL HAMILTON.

1. This is an abstract subject, my little friends, it you look
at it simply as a subject; but the things which the words
stand for are things which most of you have doubtless seen

and felt, and, I fear, mourned and wondered over. At least .

I have known so many young people disturbed by the difference

between their own lot and that of others, that I have thought a _

little talk about it might be useful to all our young folks.

2. In the ﬁrst place, little friends, let us accept the facts as
they are. The leg of an old bedstead is not so good to bat a
ball with as a real bat, broad where the ball is to be hit, and
narrow and slender where you are to take hold of it ,' and if
your well-shaped bat is also polished and carved and marked
with your name in gay letters, why, it may not win you the
game, but it is prettier to look at and easier to keep.

3. You, little girls, love to adorn yourselves with whimsi-
cal devices. You delight in stabbing your hair with long
pins, whose great, round white heads your envious brothers
tease you by calling eggs and cannon—balls. You fasten
white beads around your necks, with red, white, and blue
streamers ﬂuttering behind you, “ a large cloth-Iyerde and
more.” All right, young people, stream away as. much as you
like. Your brothers will soon get tired of teasing you, and
doubtless you can ﬁnd something equally absurd to tease
them about. Nothing is more harmless than beads and bows.

4. I regret that there are some little girls who can only
look with wistful eyes at the ﬂuttering ribbons of their friends,
without hope of attaining any such delights themselves. Not
that I -think they would be more beautiful with them than
without them,—but I like to see children have what they
Want when their wants are innocent. Here is a little boy
Who read the prospectus of the new magazine for young
people and scarcely gave it a thought. He knew he could
have it by saying a Word ; his mother would be only too glad
at the slightest symptom that he was developing a taste for
reading. ‘

THE FOURTH READER. 203.

5. Another boy lay awake nights, trying to think whether
there could be any hope of his subscribing for it, and considers
himself very happy in clubbing with three other boys, all taking
it together. He does not mind that he gets it a week after it
is out, and slightly battered at that. When a little girl who
wears calico and walks to church is playing with a little girl
who wears silk and rides in her carriage, and a third little
girl comes by and invites the latter into her garden and says’
nothing to the former, the poor little girl in calico feels slight-
ed and unhappy, and it is quite natural she should.

6. But, little friends, be comforted. You who see the ‘

fashions come and go, and are not able to follow them, you
who cannot get “ a quarter” just for the asking, you whose
clothes are a little faded, and perhaps patched here and there,
you who see the toys and the candies in the hands of other
children and not in yours, you who live in the plain, small,
and perhaps unattractive houses, let not your hearts be
troubled. 

There are many reasons why they need not be, some of
which you can understand and some you cannot. I will be-
gin with one that you cannot understand, and you must sim-
ply take my Word for it. 

7. You should not be troubled, because, although you may
miss many good things, you can always have the best things.
Character is of more consequence than clothes. If you are a
gentle little girl, if you speak in soft, pleasant tones, if you are
kindly in your acts and generous in your feelings towards all,
whether they are dressed better or worse than you, if you are
respectful to your elders, and especially to your parents, if you
are truthful and obedient, and do not talk when there is com-

' pany,——why, it is not of the smallest consequence whether

you have a ribbon tied around your neck or not.

8. If you are a brave, honest, manly boy,——if you are
polite to your mother, and take good care of your sisters,-.--
if you scorn a meanness, and are not afraid to apologize
when you have, in a passion, said or done a wrong thing,—-
then you may consider yourself extremely well off in the

l world, although you have no pony, and are rather bashful, and

must work when other boys are at play, and your jacket is
short-waisted.

204 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

9. Every good thing I have mentioned you may possess,
whether you are rich or poor. If you have not these things,
riches will do you no good,——and if you have them, poverty
will do you no hurt. I mean, if _ a girl is rough in speech and
coarse in manners, she will be disagreeable to all those whose

good opinion is worth having, even though she wear a new

hat every day with feathers ﬂoating all over it; and a well-
bred boy will be liked and favored and helped on in the

World, whether he wear broadcloth or blue overalls. This is ,

not merely what the books say, but it is true in life.

10. Let me tell you a short story to illustrate another
reason.

Two boys living next door to each other were playmates
and friends. Henry’s father was rich, and Robert’s father
was poor. Robert often used to wonder in his own mind why

I it was that Henry should have so many ﬁne things and him-

self so few. When Henry rode by on his pony, Robert had
hard work not to feel envious and unhappy. Time passed
on, and Robert left his native city. He had been a good boy,
and he became a good man and a learned man and a rich
man.‘ He drove his own horses, and lived in a handsome
house, and associated with the best people.

11. One day he ‘was walking along the beach during a
short visit at home, and he met a man whom he half recollect-
ed, and who half recollected him. “ Is this Henry ? ” “ Is
this Robert? ” And very glad they were to see each other.

“ And how goes the world with you P” asked Robert.

“ Miserably enough,” replied Henry, sadly. “I am a
pauper ! ” I

12. Robert was shocked, and hardly knew what to say,
but Henry went on frankly: “You had nothing butyour

;energies to rely on. You went abroad, and have made your-

self a name and a fortune. I had plenty of money. My
friends were unwilling to have me leave them. I had no

l 0 o n o a
genius to impel me from within, and no necessity to force me

from without. I led an aimless, useless life. I fell into ex-
travagance from sheer listlessness. I was too lazy to my};
into any thing. I had barely sense enough left to see that my
property was disappearing while there was yet a pittance re-
maining. Then I turned upon my steps, took care of the

rest, and am now subsisting upon it, with no hope in this life
and but little interest in the next.”

13. And yet, dear children, this boy gave apparently as
fair promise as the other. And now I give you the second
reason why you should not be over-much troubled if you are
poor—that poverty seems to be favorable to the best mental
and moral training of a vast majority of persons. Remem-
ber that this is not universally true. Many who are the sons
and daughters of rich men are eminently ﬁt for you to follow,
by the grace of their manners, the wisdom of their minds,

‘ and the goodness of their hearts. The beauty of their daily

life can not be surpassed. But I think you will ﬁnd that a
large majority of those who are eminent for their talents, their
virtues, and their usefulness, were not born in costly houses,
did not wear rich clothes in their childhood, and were not

provided with numerous servants, elegant carriages, and ex-

pensive toys.

14. Let me tell you also another thing. Your standing
in the world is not going to be affected by these things.
You will be appreciated when you are grown up according to
what you are, and not according to what you have. Does
your schoolmate slight you now because you dress plainly and
have little money to spend? He is a silly child for doing it,
and you are a silly child for minding it 3 but we do not blame
either of you a great deal, because we do not expect children
to be very wise. But when you shall be grown up, the time
for such things will have gone by. No gentleman or lady
will slight you for not possessing those things which are not
essential to a gentleman or lady,‘ and it is impossible to be
slighted by any one else. When you are grown up, we ex-

‘ pect you to know this, and if you could ﬁnd a little comfort

in it now I should be very glad.

15. Above all things, my little friends, do not be envious.
Be as willing to see good traits in your rich companions as
in your poor ones. Because your schoolmate comes with a
new dress every week, do not try to make out that she is
proud. Because a boy has a pony, do not insist that he tells

‘ lies. Be just and generous towards rich and poor. Think

the best you can of every one, make the most of every thing
you do possess, enjoy the pretty things which your friends

have, even though you can not get them yourself, and you will
be as happy and contented as if you owned all the silk-worms
and ponies in the world.

 

LXVI.—-THE BATTLE OF FORT DONELSON.

CHARLES C. COFFIN.

1. On Wednesday, the 12th of February, 1862, Paul,

found himself once more upon the road leading from Fort
Henry to Fort Donelson, not now alone, but guiding an army
of ﬁfteen thousand men, with forty pieces of artillery. ‘He
was on horseback, and sat so well in the saddle that the
cavalrymen said he rode like an old trooper. He was in
uniform, and wore straps on his shoulders, and was armed
with a sword and a revolver. He ‘rode in advance of all,
looking sharply into the thickets and down the ravines, to see
if there were any rebels in ambush.

2. The sharpshooters followed him. They wore gray
jackets and skull—caps, and were armed with rifles and long
hunting—kniVes. They were famous hunters, and could shoot
a deer upon the run, or bring down a prairie-chicken upon
the wing. They were tough, hearty, jolly, courageous, daring
fellows. They were in good spirits, for the rebels had ﬂed
in dismay from Fort Henry when the gunboats sent their
shells into the fort. ’

3. It was a hard march, for the roads were muddy, and T

they were obliged to wade through creeks, although it was
midwinter. Paul noticed one brave fellow among them,
whose feet were so sore that his steps were marked with
blood, which oozed from a hole in the side of his shoe, and
yet the man kept his place in the ranks.

4. “ Let me carry your gun,” said Paul, and so, taking it
across his saddle, helped the soldier. “You ought to be in
the hospital,” said Paul.

“ I can’t stay behind if there is to be any ﬁghting,” said
the soldier, thanking Paul for’ his kindness ; and then, in a
low tone, the soldier said to his comrade, “ There ain’t many
ofﬁcers like him who will help a fellow.” ‘A ‘

Tents had been left behind, and the soldiers had no shelter
from the wintry air. They cut down great trees and kindled
huge ﬁres. The farmers in that part of the country had
large herds of pigs, which roamed the woods and lived on
nuts. The soldiers had lived on salt meats for many months,
and, notwithstanding orders had been issued against commit-‘
ting depredations, they were determined to have a good sup~
per. Crack ! crack! crack ! went their riﬂes. Some, instead
of shooting, tried to catch, the pigs. There were exciting
chases, and laughing scenes,—a dozen men after one pig,
trying to seize him by the ears, or by the hind legs, or by
the tail.

6. They had a charming time, sitting around the roaring
ﬁres, inhaling the savory odors of the steaks and spareribs
broilihgand roasting over the glowing coals on forked sticks,
and of the coffee bubbling in their tin cups. The foot-sore
sharpshooter whom Paul had helped on the march cooked a
choice and tender piece, and presented it to Paul on a chin,
for they had no plates. It was cooked so nicely that Paul
thought he had never tasted a more delicious morsel.

' In the morning they had an excellent breakfast, and then
resumed the march, moving slowly and cautiously through
the woods, but ﬁnding -no enemy till they came in sight of
Fort Donelson.

7. Paul had guided the army to the fort, but now he had
other duties to perform. He was required to make a sketch
of the ground around the fort, that General Grant might
know where to form his lines,—on what hills to plant
his cannon,——where to throw up breastworks for defence,
should the rebels see ﬁt to come out and attack him.
Leaving his horse behind, Paul began his dangerous but im-
portant work on foot, that he might make an accurate map,——
examining through his ﬁeld-glass the breastworks of the
rebels, counting their cannon, and beholding them hard at
work. When night came he crept almost up to their lines.
He was between the two armies,-—-a dangerous position, for
the pickets on both sides were wide awake, and his own
comrades might ﬁre upon him before he could give the
countersign. Although he stepped lightly, the sticks some.-
times crackled beneath his feet.

LESSON XI.

THE FOUR DIPHTI-IONGrSu

In Lesson IV., “long i” was called a “name vowel.”
If you Will pronounce it quite slowly, however, you will
ﬁnd that it is composed of two vowels. Try it. The
syllable maend does not differ very much from 7m'77cZ.
“ Long 2',” then, is a double vowel,——a CZ’&']0}tt/Ft07’tg. Some
persons utter the ii, and others the 6, too cl,early, when
pronouncing such words as 7725726, tribe. Neither of the
elements ofi should be uttered as fully as if it were the
only vowel in the syllable.

Pronounce boil .' both 6 and i are quite distinctly heard,
and no error would be made "in representing the word, in
Phonic writing, thus, boil. But We will not mark either
vowel : denote this diphthong by oi.

If you pronounce £19 with one impulse, you form a

‘third diphthong, which we will denote by ou. If you

have the habit of saying kag for kou (ac) you should cor-
rect the error as soon as possible : it is extremely vulgar.
When the two elements, i and Q, are uttered with one
impulse, “long u ” is heard. This combination is a little
more diiiicult than the others. Pronounce “ short i”—~
i; 6; io. Keep trying until you hear the very sound

. uttered between the m and t in the word mute.

“ Long u ” is never heard immediately after the sound
of 7', Sb, or zit. When such might seem to be the case,
9 or u is to be heard instead. The Phonic representations,

8. “ Halt! Who goes there ? ’’ shouted a rebel picket di-
rectly in front of him. It was so sudden, and he was so
near, that Paul’s hair stood on end. He darted behind a
tree. Click! ﬂash! bang! and a bullet came with a heavy
2‘/mg into the tree. Bang! went another gun,—another,—
and another ,- and the pickets all along the rebel lines, think
ing that the Yankees were coming, blazed away at random.
The Yankee pickets, thinking that the rebels were advancing,

became uneasy and ﬁred in return. Paul could hear the

bullets spin through the air and strike into the trees. His
ﬁrst thought was to get back to his comrades as soon as ‘pos-
sible ; then he reﬂected that it would be dangerous to attempt
it just then. The ﬁring woke up all the sleepers in the two
armies. The drumsjwere beating the long roll, the bugles
were sounding, and he could hear the rebel ofﬁcers shouting
to the men “ Fall in! fall in!”

9. He laughed to think.that the cracking of a stick had
produced all this uproar. He wanted very much to join in
the fun, and give the rebel picket who had ﬁred at him areturn

‘shot, but his orders were not to ﬁre even if ﬁred upon, for

General Grant was not ready for a battle, and so, while the
rebels were reloading their guns, he glided noiselessly away.
When he heard the bullets singing through the air, he thought
that he certainly would be hit; but he calculated that, as he
was less than six feet high and only eighteen inches across
his shoulders, and as it was dark and the soldiers were ﬁring
at random, there was not one chance in a million of his being
injured, and so through the night he went on with his re~
connoissance along the lines, and completed the work assign-
ed him. 

 

LXVI1.—THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.

4 1. In the morning he found General Grant in a little old
farm-house, where he had established his head-quarters. He
appeared to be pleased with the map which Paul-made of the
ground, and said to Major Cavender, who commanded the
regiment of Missouri Artillery, “ Place your guns on that hill,
and be ready to open upon the fort.” He issued orders to

THE FOURTH READER. 209

/Gen. McClernand to go round to the southwest side of the
town; to General Wallace, to hold the center of the line,
west of the town; and to General Smith, to be ready to
storm the fort on the northwest side. '

2. It wasa beautiful morning. The air was mild, and
the birds sang in the trees though it was midwinter. The
sharpshooters ate their breakfast before sunrise, and began
the battle by exchanging shots with the rebel pickets. Though
Paul had been up all night, there was no time for rest. He
was sent with orders to the artillery ofﬁcers,—to Captain Tay-
lor, Captain Dresser, and Captain Schwartz, telling them
where to place their guns. As he rode over the hills and
through the ravines, he passed the sharpshooters. Their riﬂes
were cracking merrily. Among them was the soldier whom
Paul had helped on the march. The soldier saluted him.
Paul saw that he was not only foot—sore, but also sick.

3. “You are not fit to go into battle ; you ought to re-
port to the surgeon,” said Paul.

“ I wouldn’t miss of being in this scrimmage that we are
going to have to-day for the best farm in Illinois,” said the
soldier. ’

Just then the rebel cannon opened, and the shells came
crashing through the front. Major Cavender had wheeled
his guns into position, and was sighting them. One of the
shells struck at his feet, and ploughed a deep furrow in the
ground. Another struck a poor "fellow in the breast, whirled
him into the air, spattering his blood upon those who stood
around, killing him instantly. , '

4. As Paul beheld the quivering ﬂesh, the sight ﬁlled
him with horror, and made him sick at heart. Such might
be his fate before the day was done. He thought of
home,-——of his mother, of Azalia, and of the dear friends far
away. He thought also of God, and the hereafter 3 but he
remembered that he was in the keeping of his Heavenly
Father. He was there to do his duty, and if he was to meet
with death, he would meet it resolutely; and so, regaining
his composure, he rode calmly along the lines, acting as aid
to General Grant, doing the duties assigned him.

5. The battle lasted through the day, but the fort was
not taken. The gunboats which were to sail up the Cums

berland River had not arrived, and the provisions which the
troops brought from Fort Henry were nearly exhausted. The
day which had been so bright and beautiful was succeeded
by a dreary night. The wind blew from the northeast. A
rain-storm set in, which changed to snow, and became one of
the severest storms ever known in that section of the coun-
try. It was a terrible night for the wounded. They had no
protection from the storm. Hundreds had fallen during the
day. g

6. Some were lying where they fell, close up under the
rebel breastworks, amid the tangled thickets, the blood ooz-
ing from their wounds and staining the drifting snow. It
was heart-rending to hear their wailings, and cries of dis~
tress, and calls for help. When morning came, many a brave
soldier was frozen to the ground. When Paul saw the ter-
rible suffering, he felt that he was willing to make any sacri-
fice to put a stop to such horrors. But then he remembered
that Justice, Truth, and Righteousness are more valuable
than human life, and that it is better to ﬁght for them than to
yield to injustice and wickedness.

7. But now the hearts of the soldiers were cheered with
the news that the gunboats were coming. Paul looked down
the river and saw a cloud of black smpke hanging over the
forest, rising from their tall chimneys. Steamboats loaded
with provisions came with the ﬂeet. Tahe soldiers swung
their caps, and made the air ring with their lusty cheers.

8. What a magniﬁcent sight it was when the gunboats
steamed up the river and opened ﬁre upon the fort, cover-
ing themselves with clouds of smoke and ﬂame, and all of
the guns in the fort replying! The storm had died away,
the air was still, and the roar of the cannonade was like
thunder. All along the lines the sharpshooter riﬂes were
ringing. The soldiers crowded behind trees and logs and
hillocks, lying on their faces, picking off the rebel gunners
when they attempted to load their cannon. But the day
passed and the fort was not taken. Saturday morning came,
and the rebels, ﬁnding themselves short of provisions, instead
of waiting to be attacked, came out from the fort at day-
break, ﬁfteen thousand strong, and made a sudden attack
upon the Union army.

THE FOURTH READER. 211.

9. A great battle followed which lasted nearly all day.
Thousands were killed and wounded. Paul was obliged to
ride all over the ﬁeld, carrying orders to the different
generals, while the bullets fell like hailstones around him.
Cannon-balls ﬂew past him, shells exploded over his head,
men fell near him, but he was unharmed. He saw with
grief his comrades overpowered and driven back, and he
could scarcely keep back the tears" when he saw the rebels
capture some of Captain Schwartz’s guns. But when the in-
fantry gave way and ﬂed panic-stricken along the road t0~
wards Fort Henry, throwing away their muskets, his indigna-
tion was aroused.

10. “ Stop! or I’ll shoot you,” he said, drawing his rev
volver. ‘

“ A’n’t you ashamed of yourselves, you cowards?” shout-
ed one brave soldier.

Paul looked round to see who it was, and discovered his
friend the sharpshooter, who thus aided him in rallying the
fugitives. Blood was dripping from his ﬁngers. A ball had
passed through one arm, but he had tied his handkerchief over
the Wound, and was on his way back to the lines to take part
once more in the battle. Paul thanked the noble fellow for
helping him, and then, with the aid of other ofﬁcers, they ral-
lied the fugitives till reinforcements came. ,

11. Onward came the rebels, ﬂushed with success, and
thinking to win a glorious victory: but they were cut down
with shells and canister, and by the volleys of musketry which
were poured upon them. It was with great satisfaction that
Paul saw the shells tear through the rebel ranks ; not that he
liked to see men killed, but because he wanted Right to
triumph over Wrong. Again and again the rebels marched
up the hill, but were as often swept back by the terrible ﬁre
which burst from Captain Wood’s, Captain Willard’s, Captain
Taylor’s, and Captain Dresser’s batteries.

12. The little brook which trickled through the ravine at
the foot of the hill was red with the blood of the slain. It was
a fearful sight. But the rebels at last gave up the attempt to
drive the Union troops from the hill, and went back into the
fort. Then in the afternoon there was a grand charge upon
the rebel breastworks. With a wild hurrah they carried the

212 A o ANALYTICAL SERIES.

old ﬂag across the ravine, and up the hill beyond, over fallen
trees and through thick underbrush.

13. Men dropped from the ranks in scores, but on——on-—-
on they went, driving the rebels, planting the stars and stripes
on the works ,' and though the rebel regiments in the fort
rained solid shot and shell and grape and canister and musk-=
et-balls upon them, yet they held the ground through the long,
weary, dreary winter night. When the dawn came, the clavm
of Sunday, they saw a white ﬂag ﬂung out from the parapet of
the fort, and they knew that the enemy had surrendered.
What a cheer they gave! They swung their hats, sang
songs, and danced for joy. How beautifully the stars and
stripes waved in the morning breeze! How proudly they
marched- into the fort and into the town,————the drums
beating, the bugles sounding, and the bands playing.

14. But how horrible the sight upon the ﬁeld when the

contest was over,—the dead, some cold and ghastly, others I

still warm with departing life, lying with their faces toward
Heaven, smiling as if only. asleep! The ground was strewn
with guns, knapsacks, and blood—stained garments ; the snow
had changed to crimson. Many wounded were lying where
they fell, some, whose lives were ebbing away, calmly waiting
the coming of death.

15. As Paul walked over the ﬁeld he came upon one ly-
ing with clasped hands and closed eyes, whose life-blood was
running away from a ghastly wound in his breast. As Paul
stopped to gaze a moment upon a countenance which seemed
familiar, the soldier opened his eyes and smiled ; then Paul

. saw that it was the brave sharpshooter whom he had helped

on the march, who, though sick, would not go into the hos-

! pital, and who, though wounded, would not leave the ﬁeld,

and who aided him in rallying the fugitives. .He had fought
gallantly through the battle, and received his death wound in
the last grand charge.

16. “ I am glad you have come, for I know that one who
was kind enough to help a poor fellow on the march will be
willing to do one thing more,” said the soldier faintly.

“ Certainly, what can I do for you?”

“ Not much, only I would like to have you overhaul my

knapsack for me.”

THE FOURTH READER. ’ 213

Paul unstrapped the knapsack from the soldier’s back, and
opened it.

“There is a picture in there which I want to look at
once more before-I die. You will ﬁnd it in my Bible.”

Paul handed him the Bible. ,

17. “ My mother gave it to me the day I left home to join
the army. It was her last gift. I promised to read it every
day, and I would like to have you write to her and tell her
that I have kept my promise. Tell her that I have tried to
do my duty to my country and to my God. I would like to live
but am not afraid to die, and I am not sorry that I enlisted.
Write to my sister. She is a sweet girl,—I can see her now,—
a bright-eyed, light-hearted, joyous creature. 0, how she will
miss me! Tell her to plant a rose-bush in the garden and
call it my rose, that little Eddie, when he grows up, may re-
member that his eldest brother died for his country. They
live away up in Wisconsin.”

18. He took a photograph from the Bible. It was the
picture of a dark—haired, black-eyed, fair—featured girl. He
gazed upon it till the tears rolled down his cheeks. He
drew his brawny hand across his face and wiped them away,
but the effort started the bright blood ﬂowing in a fresher
stream. “ It is hard to part from her. She promised to be
my wife when I came home from the war,” he said, and
touched it to his lips, then gazed again till his sight grew dim.
He laid it with the Bible on his breast.

Paul wiped the cold sweat from the soldier’s brow.

“God bless you, ” he whispered, and looked up and
smiled. His eyes closed, and the slowly heaving heart stood
still. He was gone into the land where the Faithful and
True receive their just reward;

Nay, nay, your question has done no harm, dear,
Though it woke for a moment a thrill of pain,
For whenever I look at my stump of an arm here,

I seem to be living that day again.

2. A cloud of sulphurous haze hung o’er us,
As prone we lay in the trampled mire ;
Shells burst above us, andright before us
A rebel battery belched forth ﬁre.
All at once to the front our Colonel galloped,

His form through the smoke looking dim and large,

“You see that battery, boys,” he shouted,
“We’re ordered to take it. Ready! Charge 1”

3. What a thrill I felt as the word was given ;

At once to his feet each soldier leapt,

One long, wild shout went up to heaven,
Then down on the foe like the wind we swept

Each fought that day for his country’s honor ;

‘ We gained the edge of a slippery bank,

I drove from his post a rebel gunner,

And then--the rest is a perfect blank.

4. What need to tell of the days that followed,

Each dragging painfully, slowly by,

Till wearied out by my constant pleading,
They sent me home, as they thought to die.

My sire was dead, and my own loved mother
Was wasting away with toil and care,

I.’d a little sister and feeble brother,
And I——I could be but aburden there.

:2. And so this peddler’s trunk I bought me,
Filled it with needles, pins, tape, and thread,
Housewives’ stores, as my mother taught me,
And I sell them to win my daily bread.
When the frost on the ﬁelds lies still and hoary,
My way through the village streets I take,
My empty coat-sleeve tells its story,
And they’re kind to me for the old ﬂag’s sake.

6. It was not regret that made me falter,
Nor sorrow that made my eye grow dim,
I offered all on my country’s altar,
And she was pleased to accept a limb.
Maimed, but yet to regrets a stranger,
The thought that gives me the keenest pain
Is this,——were my country once more in danger
I never could ﬁght in her ranks again.

 

LXIX.-—THE HOSPITAL NURSE.

CHARLES C. COFFIN.

1. As the weeks passed by, bringing no intelligence to
New Hope that Paul was living,-—when there was no longer
a doubt of his death,——Father Surplice held a memorial ser-
vice. It was on Sunday, and all the people were at church.
Appropriate for the occasion were the words which he read
from the New Testament, of the widow of Nain,—how, “ as
Jesus came nigh to the city, there was a dead man carried out,
the only son of his mother, and she was a widow ; and when the
Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said, ‘Weep
not 1 ’ ”

2. Consoling and comforting were his own words, which
sank deep into the hearts of the stricken people ; and though
the good man said “ Weep not 1 ” tears dropped from his own
eyes, and fell upon the great Bible which lay open before him.
It was a sad and solemn service. Though the heart of the
mother was yearning for her son, yet she could say, “ The
Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away ; blessed be the name
of the Lord.” T

3. Mrs. Parker still lived in the little old cottage. The
sneighbors were very kind, and she wanted for nothing, for
Colonel Dare remembered his promise. Peaceful was her
life. The birds sang cheerful songs; sweet was the hum-
ming of the bees, flfagrant the ﬂowers in the garden, and
steady the ﬂowing of the river; and as she listened to the
waterfall, she thought of Paul as standing by the River of
Life. How, then, could she mourn for him? Yet she miss-

ed him. Sometimes she listened as if to hear his footsteps
coming up the garden walk. Sometimes her eyes ﬁlled with
tears, as her heart went out to the lonely battle-ﬁeld where she
thought him lying. 0, if she could but behold him again,——-
clasp him in her arms,—and once more lay her hand upon
his brow, and bless him with a mother’s tenderest love !

4. But he was gone, and for him she could work no more.
His comrades were bearing on’ the flag, upholding it on
bloody ﬁelds, ﬁghting as he fought, suffering as he suffered,
needing help and comfort and cheer from those at home.
There was work to be done for them ; so, through the days
she sat in the old kitchen,‘ knitting and sewing for the sol-
diers, wishing that she had half a dozen hands instead of two,
that she’ might help them more.

5. There was one who came to aid her every day,—Aza-
lia, who, in the silence and seclusion of her chamber, had
looked out upon the yellow harVest—ﬁelds where the farmers
were gathering the ﬁrst ripe ears of seed-corn, and had tried
to still the wild commotion in her heart by remembering that
it was just and right for the Lord of the harvest to gather his
“ choicest grains.” Down on the lowlands by the river the
nursery-men were selecting their fairest trees, and trans-
planting them in their orchards on the pleasant hills beyond
the stream. Why, then, should she complain, if the kind
Father had seen ﬁt to do the same?

6. It was consoling to take from her bureau drawer,
where her keepsakes were stored, the letters which Paul had
written, undo the black ribbon which she had tied around the
package, and read again and again that which she almost
knew by heart. What manly words were there: “ Life is
worth nothing unless devoted to noble ends. I can see the
millions yet to come beckoning me to do my duty for their
sake. What answer can I give them if I falter? ”

7. So read one of the letters. They were words which
she could not forget. They were written fromthe trenches be-
fore Vicksburg, when -the prospects of the country were dark
and g1oomy,——when craven men at home were crying,
“ Peace I Peace ! Let us have peace at any price I ” forgetting
that there can be no reconcilement between right and wrong.
Paul had sacriﬁced every thing—life itself---for the sake of

TI-ZIE FOURTH READER. 217

those who were to come after him,—-for Truth and Jus-
tice. S

8. She thought of him as asleep beneath the sod of the
battle-ﬁeld ‘where he fell,—of all that was mortal lying there,
but of his soul as having passed  into heaven, perhaps even
then beholding her from the celestial sphere. “What answer
can I give to those who come after me?” The question
haunted her through the waning days and the lonely nights.
What could she do ? How listless her life I of how little ac-2
count 1 How feeble, forceless, and narrow all her efforts 2
What sacriﬁce had she made? None. She had. lived for
herself alone. Was this all of life ?

9. In the silent hours, when all around were hushed in
slumber, her longing soul, with far—reaching sight, looked out
upon the coming years, and beheld the opening prospect,—
a country saved, a nation redeemed, justice and truth tri-
umphant, and Peace, with her white wings, brooding over the
land! This through sacriﬁce of blood, of strength, of ease,
and comfort. To withhold the sacriﬁce was to lose all. To
her the coming millions were beckoning as they had beck-
oned to him. With prayers of consecration she gave herself
to the country,——to go wherever duty called, to labor, to en-

. dure hardship, and brave scenes which would wring out her

heart’s blood,—to face disease and death itself, if need be,
to hand down a priceless inheritance to the coming ages.

10. “ You will get sick, my child. You have not strength
to be a nurse in the hospital,” said her mother, when Azalia
told her that she must go and take care of the soldiers.

“ I can not spare you, my daughter,” said her father, ten-
derly taking her in his arms, and kissing her ruby lips. She

.was his only child, and he ‘loved her dearly. “ I don’t think

it is your -duty to go ; and how lonesome the house would be
without my darling ! ”

11. And so, knowing that it was her duty to do whatever
her parents wished, she tried to be content. But the days
dragged wearily. She was ever thinking of the soldi&s,_—-
thinking through the days and through. the nights, till the

- bright bloom faded from her cheek. Her heart was far away.

Her life was incomplete,—'—she felt that it was running to
Waste.

14. Her step was light upon the ﬂoor ; soothing and ten-

pure as that which beamed from her earnest eyes. The sick
waited impatiently for her appearance in the morning,
lwatched her footsteps during the day, thanked her for-all she
did, and said, “ God bless you ! ” when she bade them good
night. Men who were in the habit of uttering fearful oaths
wept when she talked with them about their mothers; she

wrote their letters, and read to them the words of affection

which came from home. She sang the songs they loved to
hear. It was like wine to the weak.

Beneath the hawthorn on the green they made me
Queen of May.

And we danced about the May-pole and in the hazel

Till Char1es’s Wain came out above the tall white

There’s not a ﬂower on all the hills ; the frost is on the A

I only wish to live till the snowdrops come again.
I wish the snow would melt and the sun come out on

I long to see a ﬂower so, before the day I die.

All night I lie awake, but I fall asleep at morn ;

But I would see the sun rise upon the glad New Year,
So, if you’re waking, call me, call me early, mother dear.

THE CONCLUSION.

I thought to pass away before, and yet alive I am ;

And in the ﬁelds all round I hear the bleating of the lamb.

How sadly, I remember, rose the morning of the year!

To die before the snowdrop came, and now the violet’s
here.

0 sweet is the new violet, that comes beneath the skies,

And sweeter is the young lamb’s Voice to me that can
not rise, ’
And sweet is all the land about, and all the ﬂowers that
~ blow,
And sweeter far is death than life to me that long to go.

It seemed so hard at ﬁrst, mother, to leave the blessed
sun,

And now it seems as hard to stay 3 and yet, His will be
done!

But still I think it can’t‘be long before I ﬁnd release ;

And that good man, the clergyman, has told me words
of peace.

Have you heard the wooing breeze,

And the drowsy hum of bees,

On its way—

Let their silver voices fall
On thy heart with happy call,

“ Praise the Lord! who loveth all,

LXXIII.——THE SAGACIOUS DOG.

HARRIET B. STOWE.

1. Aunt Esther’s stories were not generally fairy tales,
but stories about real things,——and oftener on her favorite sub-
ject of the habits of animals, and the different animals she
had known, than about any thing else.

2. One of these was a famous Newfoundland dog, named
Prince, which belonged to an uncle of hers in the country,
and was, as we thought, a far more useful and faithful member
of society than many of us youngsters. Prince used to be
a grave, sedate dog, that considered himself put in trust of
the farm, the house, the cattle, and all that was on the place.
At night he slept before the kitchen door, which, like all other
doors in the house in those innocent days, was left unlocked
all night 5 and if such a thing had ever happened as that a
tramper or an improper person of any kind had even touched
the latch of the door, Prince would have been up attending
to him as master of ceremonies.

3. At early dawn, when the family began to stir, Prince
was up and out to superintend the milking of the cows, after
which he gathered them all together, and started out with

them to pasture, padding steadily along behind, dashing out

once “I a while to reclaim some wanderer that thoughtlessly
began to make her breakfast by the roadside, instead of
saving her appetite for the pastures, as a properly behaved
cow should. .

4. Arrived at the pasture-lot, Prince would take down the
bars with his teeth, drive in the cows, put up bars, and
then soberly turn tail and pad off home, and carry the dinner«
basket for the men to the “ mowing-lot,” or the potato—ﬁeld,
or wherever the labors of the day might be. There arrived,
he was extremely useful to send on errands after any thing
forgotten or missing: “ Prince! the rake is missing; go to
the barn and fetch it ! ” and away Prince would go, and
come back with his head very high, and , the long rake very
judiciously balanced in his mouth. -

dog, and his master thought he would show off his tricks in
a still more original style ; and so, calling Prince to him, he
said, “ Go home and bring Puss to me ! ”

Away bounded Prince towards the farm—house, and,
looking about, found the younger of the two cats, fair Mistress
Daisy, busy cleaning her white velvet in the summer sun.
Prince took her gently up by the nape of her neck, and carried

her, hanging head and heels together, to the ﬁelds, and laid ,

her down at his master’s feet.

6. “ How’s this, Prince ? ” said the master ; “ you didn’t
understand me. I said the cat,’ and this is the kitten. Go
right back and bring the old cat.”

Prince looked very much ashamed of his mistake, and
turned away, with drooping ears and tail, and went back to
the house.

The old cat was a venerable, somewhat portly old dame,
and no small lift for Prince ; but he re-appeared with old
Puss hanging from his jaws, and set her down, a little dis-
composed, but not a whit hurt, by her unexpected ride.

7. Sometimes, to try Prince’s skill, his master would hide
his gloves or riding-whip in some out-of-the-way corner, and
when ready to start, would say, “ Now, where have I left my
gloves? Prince, good fellow, run in, and ﬁnd them ;” and
Prince would dash into the house, and run hither and thither
with his nose to every nook and corner of the room ; and, no
matter how artfully they were hid, he would upset and tear his
way to them. He would turn up the corners of the carpet,
snuff about the bed, run his nose between the feather-bed
and mattress, pry into the crack of a half—opened drawer, and
show as much zeal and ingenuity as apoliceman, and seldom
could any thing be so hid as to bafﬂe his perseverance.

8. Many people laugh at the idea of being careful of a
dog’s feelings, as if it were the height of absurdity ; and yet it
is a fact that some dogs are as exquisitely sensitive to pain,
shame, and mortiﬁcation, as any human being. See, when a
dog is spoken harshly to, what a universal droop seems to
come over him. His head and ears sink, his tail drops and
slinks between his legs, and his whole air seems to say, “ I
wish I could sink into the earth to hide myself.”

9. Prince’s young master, without knowing it, was the

THE FOURTH READER. 229

means of inflicting a most, terrible mortiﬁcation on him at one
time. It was very hot weather, and Prince, being a shaggy
dog, lay panting, and lolling his tongue out, apparently suf«
fering from the heat.

10. “I declare,” said young master George, “ I do believe
Prince would be more comfortable for being sheared.” And
so forthwith he took him and began divesting him of his
coat. Prince took it all very obediently; but when he ap-
peared without his usual attire, every one saluted him with
roars of laughter, and Prince was dreadfully mortiﬁed. He
broke away from his master, and scampered off home at a
desperate pace, ran down cellar and disappeared from view.
His young master was quite distressed that Prince took the
matter so to heart ; he followed him in vain, calling, “ Prince!
Prince!” N o Prince appeared.

11. He lighted a candle and searched the cellar, and
found the poor creature cowering away in the darkest nook
under the stairs. Prince was not to be comforted ; he slunk
deeper and deeper into the darkness, and crouched on the
ground when he saw his master, and for a long time refused

even to take food. The family all visited and condoled with

him, and ﬁnally his sorrows were somewhat abated ; but he
would not be persuaded to leave the cellar for nearly a week.
Perhaps by that time he indulged the hope that his hair was
beginning to grow again, and all were careful not to destroy
the illusion by any jests or comments on his appearance.

gerous. Men speculate on the clouds ; they begin to calcu-

Will it never stop ? The hay is out, and spoiling. The rain

drunk their ﬁll. The springs revive, the meadows are wet ;
the rivers run discolored with soil from every hill. Smoking
cattle reek under the sheds. Hens, and fowl in general,

. shelter and plume. The sky is leaden. The clouds are full

yet. The long ﬂeece covers the mountains. ‘ The hills are
capped in white. The air is full of moisture.

humors or interests I

'4. But if one will but look for enjoyment, how muchthere
is in every change of weather. The formation of clouds,——
the various signs and signals, the uncertain wheeling and
marching of the ﬂeccy cohorts, the shades of light and gray

in the broken heavens,—all have their pleasure to an ob--

servant eye. Then come the wind-gust, the distant, dark
cloud, the occasional ﬁery streak shot down through it, the
run and hurry of men whose work may suffer 1

5. Indeed, sir, your humble servant, even, was stirred up
on theday after “Fourzﬂé of _7uZ_y.” The grass in the old
orchard was not my best. Indeed, we grumbled at it con-
siderably while it was yet standing. But being cm‘ and the
rain threatening it, one would have thought it gold, by the
nimble way in which we tried to save it! ‘

6. Blessed be horse-rakes ! Once half a dozen men, with
half a dozen rakes, would have gone whisking up and down,
thrusting out and pulling in the long-handled rake, with slow
and laborious process. But no more of that. See friend
Turner, mounted on the wheeled horse-rake, riding about as
if for pleasure. Up go’ the steel teeth and drop their collect~
ed load, down go his feet, and the teeth are at work again ;
and at every ten or ﬁfteen feet, the windrow forms. It is easy
times when men ride and ﬁorses rake ! N o more hand-rakes,

through the air, and spit here and there a drop preliminary.

But the hay is cocked, the sides dressed down, and all is
ready—except the /zay-co72ers./ Alas for’ our negligence!
The manufacturers had offered to send us some for trial, and
we had forgotten to say, “ Send them along!” And now,
with our hay out and the rain coming, we mourned our care-

lessness. With good hay-covers, our two dozen little hay-1

cocks would have been as snug as if in the barn.

leaves are washed, the grass drinks, corn drinks, the garden
drinks, every thing drinks. It’s our opinion that every thing

except man is laughing and rejoicing. Trees shake their
leaves with a softer sound. Rocks look moist and soft, at
least where the moss grows. Even the solitary old pine-tree
chords his harp, and sings soft and low melodies with plain-
tive undulations !

9. A good summer storm is a rain of riches. If gold
and silver rattled down from the clouds, they would hardly
enrich the land so much as soft, long rains. Every drop is
silver going to the mint. The roots are machinery, and
catching the willing drops, they assay them, reﬁne them, roll
them, stamp them, and turn them out coined berries, apples,

grains, and grasses! When the heavens ‘send clouds, and ‘_

they bank up the horizon, be sure they have hidden gold in

' them.

10. All the mountains of California are not so rich as are
the soft mines of Heaven, that send down treasures upon
man without tasking him, and pour riches upon his ﬁeld with-
out spade or pickaX,——without his search or notice. Well,
let it rain, then! N o matter if the journey is delayed, the
picnic spoiled, the visit adjourned. Blessed be rain——and
rain in summer ! And blessed be He who watereth the earth,
and enricheth it for man and beast!

Fair and sweet as summer ﬂowers.

. Each white blossom, rosy-tinted,

Sat within a cup of green,
Rising whence, like fairy torches,
Golden stamens stood between.

With a ﬁerce and noisy glee,

Eager for the hoarded honey,
Buzzed all day the toiling bee.

Passing in the morning cool,
Taking nosegays thence to cheer them
Through the lengthened hours of schools.

There the red-tailed cock was seen,
With their canopies above them,
Like a monarch and his queen.

. Breezes came and kissed the blossoms,

Pleased their playfellows to be ;
But, at last, too rudely sportive,
Shook them, tore them from the tree.

Falling thus, all widely scattered,

V There a carpet soft they made,

Heaps on heaps of velvet petals
Woven in with light and shade.

Still the sturdy cups that held them
Kept their places on the stem,

And within their clasping bosoms
Bore they each a precious gem.

Pushing upward, warm -and eager,
Now scarce larger than a pea,

Strove young apples, hard and bitter,
Ripened in the sun to be.

Hard and hairy! Will such atoms
Ever reach to size and strength?
Will the apple-robe of beauty
Wrap their meagre forms at length?

All the days of June delightful,
When the damask roses grew,
’Mid thick leaves concealed, the apples
L Silently were growing too.

And the Robin redbreast saw them
As she sat within her nest,

Patient, motionless, and watchful,
With the eggs beneath her breast.

Larger, larger, all through July
Robin saw them ; but before

August came, came forth her young ones
And she watched the fruit no more.

Robin said, “Of course my children
I must nourish ; yet I’m loath

To abandon those young apples,—
Hope it will not stop their growth.”

All the apples laughed to hear her :.
Larger grew they every day,

’ Swelling in the glow of summer,

Ripening in the noontide ray. ‘

Like the streaks upon the tulip,
Purple gleams across them spread,

Or they yellowed in the sunlight,
Or they blushed a rosy red.

And the people at the farm—house,
When October days had come,

Joyful, brought and ﬁlled their baskets.
Bore the fragrant apples home.

Now the tree, her look so lively,
Look so fresh, had ceased to wear ;

Bird and bee had left her,—only
Robin’s empty nest was there.

Hour by hour the leaves were dropping,
And among the boughs, forlorn,

Autumn wind came sighing, sobbing,
Till the last brown leaf was born.

White-winged hen and kingly rooster
Soon the failing tree forsook,-—

In the barn, on beam orrafter,
More at ease their slumber took.

Bravely stood the tree and cheery,
Though so gray and leaﬂess grown;
Hopeful still, but Very lonely,-—

When the winter snow-drifts covered
All the landscape, high and low,
Tippets white she wrapped about her,

Graceful tippets of the snow.

March! And now the frozen rain—drop$
Glittering hung from all her stems,

And she _‘stood in jewels blazing,
Decked from top to toe in gems.

Spring returned. Without pursuit

Came the young buds, came the blossom,

LXXIX.-—HELPING FATHER.

WILLIAM L. WILLIAMS.

1. “ Money does not last long now-a-days, Clarissa,” said
Mr. Andrews to his wife one evening. “ It is only a week
since I received my month’s salary, and now I have but lit-
tle more than half of it left. I bought a cord of pine wood
to-day, and to-morrow I must pay for that suit of clothes which
Daniel had ,- that will be ﬁfteen dollars more.”

2. “ And Daniel will need a pair of new shoes in a day
or two ; those he wears now are all ripped, and hardly ﬁt. to
wear,” said Mrs. Andrews.

“ How fast he wears out shoes I It seems hardly a fort-
night since I bought the last shoes for him,” said the father.

“O, well! But then he enjoys running about so much .

that I can not check his pleasure as .long as it is harmless.
I am sure you would feel sorry to see the little _shoes last
longer from not being used so much,” answered the affection-
ate mother.

3. Daniel, during this conversation, was sitting on the
ﬂoor in a corner with his kitten, trying to teach her to stand
upon her hind legs. He was apparently much occupied with

his efforts, but he heard all that his father and mother

had said. Pretty soon he arose, and, going to his father,

climbed upon his knee and said, “ Papa, do I cost you a good I

deal of money ? ”

4. Now, Mr. Andrews was book-keeper. for a manufac-
turing company, and his salary was hardly sufficient for him
to live comfortably at the rate every thing was selling, owing
to the Rebellion. He had nothing to spare for superﬂuities,
and his chief enjoyment was being at home with his wife and
boy, his books and pictures. Daniel’s question was a queer
one, but his father replied as correctly as he could.

240 A ANALYTICAL SERIES.

5. “ Whatever money you may cost me, my son, I do not
regret it, for I know that it adds to your comfort and enjoy-
ment. ” To be sure, your papa does not have a great deal
of money, but he would be poor indeed without his little
Daniel.”

6. “How much will my new suit of clothes cost?” asked
Daniel.

“ Fifteen dollars,” was the reply.

“ And how much for my shoes? ”

“ Two dollars more, perhaps,” said his father.

“ That will make seventeen dollars. I wish I could work
and earn some money for you, father,” said Daniel.

“ 0, well, my son, don’t think about that now. If you are
a good boy and study well at school, that will repay me am-
ply,” said Mr. Andrews.

7. Daniel saidsno more, but he determined to try and see
if he could not help to pay for the clothes his father was so
kind as to buy him. An opportunity soon occurred. That
very afternoon the load of wood which his father bought came,
and was thrown off close to the cellar door. It was Wednes-
day, and there was no school. .

“Now I can save father some money,” thought Daniel ;
and he ran into the house to ask his mother if he could‘ put
the wood into the cellar.

8. “ I am afraid it is too heavy work for you, my son,”
said his mother.

“ I think I can do it, mother. The wood lies close to the
cellar door, and all I shall have to do is to pitch it right down,”
replied Daniel.

“Very well, you may try it ; but if you ﬁnd it too hard
you must give it up, and let Tim Rooney put it in,” said his
mother.

9. Daniel danced away, and went ﬁrst to the cellar, when

' he unhooked the trapdoor and opened it, and climbed out into

the yard where the sticks of wood lay in a great heap. At
ﬁrst it was good fun to send the sticks clattering one on top
of the other down into the cellar, but pretty soon "it grew te-
dious, and Daniel began to think that he had rather do some-
thing else. Just then George F lyson came into the yard and

asked Daniel if he wasn’t going to ﬁsh for smelts that day.

THE FOURTH READER. 241

10. “ I guess not. This wood must go in, and then it will
be too late to go so far this afternoon,” replied Daniel.

“ 0, let the wood slide ! We have got some round at our
house that ought to go in, but I shan’t do it. Father may
hire a man to do such work. Come, old Rooney will be glad
of that job,” said George.

11. “ No, I am‘ going to do this before any thing else,”
said Daniel, as he picked up a big stick and sent it scooting
down the cellar-way.

“ Did your old man make you do it? ” asked Flyson.

“ Who? ” queried Daniel, so sharply that the boy saw his
error, and corrected his form of question.

“ Did your father make you do this job ? ”

1:3. “ No ; he does not know I am doing it ; and, by the
way, George Flyson, don’t you call my father " old man.’ If
you don’t know any better than to treat your father disre-
spectfully, you shan’t treat mine so,” answered Daniel.

“ Ho ! Seems to me you are getting mighty pious all of a
sudden. Guess I’ll have to be going. I’m not _good enough
for you,”———and, with a sneering look, George went off

13. The woodpile down cellar grew larger, until the wood-
pile in the yard was all gone, then Daniel shut down the trap-
door, ran into the house and brushed his clothes, and started
out to ﬁnd his playmates and have a game of base—ball. He
felt very happy, for he had earned something for a kind father
who was always earning something for him 3 and the thoughts of
this much pleased him. He felt happier still when his father
came home to supper, and said while at the table, “ My wood
did not come, did it, mother? I told the man to send it up
this afternoon, certainly.” Mr. Andrews always called his
wife “mother.”

14. “ 0, yes, the wood came, I saw the team back into the
yard,” replied Mrs. Andrews.

“ Then Rooney must have put it in. I suppose he will
charge ﬁfty or seventy-ﬁve cents for doing it, ” said Mr. An-
drews.

“ I think a boy put it in,” said his wife.

“ What boy? ” »- 1:.

"' O, a smart little fellow that plays around here a good
deal. 1 He wanted the job, and so I let him do it,” said Mrs.

Andrews.

15. “ Some little chap that wanted some pocket—money, I
suppose. Whose boy was it?” said Mr. Andrews.

“ There he is ; he willtell you about it,”—and Mrs. An-
drews pointed to Daniel, who was enjoying the fun quietly.

[And now he was pleased indeed to hear how gratiﬁed his

father was at ﬁnding his little boy so industrious and thought-
fill. It repaid him amply for not going smelt—ﬁshing.

16. It was not long after this that the bleak winds of
November began to blow ; the leaves of the trees fell lifeless
to the earth ; and every thing prepared to put on the ermine
garb of winter. One evening when Daniel went to bed he
put aside his curtain, and looked out into the street. He
was surprised to ﬁnd it white with snow. Silently and gen-
tly, one by one, the tiny ﬂakes had fallen, until hillside and
valley, street and housgtop, were covered with the spotless
snow.  W

17. “ I wonder how deep it will be by morning. Perhaps
there will be enough for sleighing. Old Rooney will be

’, round to clear off the sidewalk and platforms. I must get

ahead of him this winter, and save father some more money,”
and Daniel got into bed as quick as he could, so that he
should awake early in the morning.

When Mr. Andrews awoke the next day, he heard the
scraping of a shovel on the sidewalk, and said to his wife,

.“ Tim has got along early this morning. These snow—storms

are proﬁtable to him. Last winter I guess I paid him ﬁve or
six dollars for shoveling snow.”

18. When he got up, however, and looked out of the win-
dow, he was not a little astonished to see Daniel shoveling
off the sidewalk, his cheeks all aglow with the healthy exer-
C156.

“ See that boy, mother,” said he to his wife, “he has
cleared the walk off nicely. What a good little fellow he is.
When Christmas comes we must reward him for all this.”

19. And so Daniel went on according to this beginning.

\He cleared the snow of after every storm ; in the spring-time

he put the garden and yard all in order, and did a great many
things which his father had always paid a man for doing.
And he had plenty of time -to play besides, and then he enjoy-
ed his play better, because there is always a satisfaction in

doing good, which lends a charm to every thing that we un-
dertake.

20. One day, about a year afte_r the day that Daniel had
put in the first load of wood, his father said to him, “ My son,
I have kept a memorandum of the work which you have done
for me the past year, and I ﬁnd, that, allowing you what I
should have paid Tim Rooney or any other person, I owe
you to—day forty—two dollars and sixty cents.”

21. “ So much as that, father? Why, I did not know
that I could earn so much all myself, and I did not work very
hard either,” said Daniel.

“ Some of it was pretty _hard work for a little boy that likes
to play,” replied his father, “ but you did it well, and now I
am ready to pay you.”

“ Pay me P What ! the real money right in my hands P ”

22. “Yes, the real money,” and Mr. Andrews placed a
roll of “ greenbacks” in his little son’s hands.

Daniel looked at it for a few minutes, and then said, “ I’ll
tell you what to do with this money for me, papa.” A

“ What, my son?” , 1

“ Buy my clothes with it for the next year,” said Daniel.

And Mr. Andrews did so.

LXXXII.-——»—T.HE VETERAN EAGLE.
MARIA s. CUIMMINS.

1. A friend of mine, lately returned from the West, spent
nearly the whole of his ﬁrst visit to us in telling about the
Wisconsin Eagle. Among all the novelties of his journey,
nothing had apparently interested him so much as this bird ;
and if you young folks are half as much pleased as I was
with the story, and the thoughts to which it gave rise, it will
have been quite worth while for me to record them for your
beneﬁt.

2. You will see that I call the hero of my story a Veteran
Eagle 3 but you must not on that account imagine him to be an
old, decrepit bird, with drooping wings, subdued spirits, and

. an eye dimmed with age ; for, on the contrary, he is still act-

ive, keen—sighted, and young, as much the king of birds as
ever. In fact, he is no more and no less a veteran than all
our brave young officers and privates, who, though mere

boys, have won the title of veterans by the experience they
have had, and the service they have done in camps and on

battle-ﬁelds ; for you must know that the Wisconsin Eagle is
a soldier, has served three years, been in ﬁfteen battles, and

_done good service to his country.

3. But in telling you his story I must begin at the
beginning, and omit no circumstance of his origin, birth-
place, enlistment in the army, rank, equipment, 864:. -And

this I am the better able to do, because, since I have been
writing this account, a lady who learned my purpose has sent
me a pamphlet containing a veritable history of this bird,
which was circulated at ‘the Chicago Fair,———an authority by
which I shall verify or correct my facts, and fromwhich I
shall perhaps occasionally quote.

4. He belonged to the Bald-Head, or more correctly the
White-Headed family, a species which in some respects are

all young veterans, inasmuch as, at three or four years old,-

their head—feathers, which are originally brown, have become-
snowy white, giving them a digniﬁed and venerable appear-
ance. Their other name of Bald—Head is derived from a spot
between the beak and eyes, which is almost wholly destitute
of feathers, so that the Bald Eagle, which is the emblem of
America, assumes in his youth the honors which belong to a
bald head and a hoary crown, although one would think he
might afford to wait longer for them, as the eagle is a very
long—lived bird, instances having been known of his living to
be a hundred years old.

5. And so with the country of which the Bald-Head is
the representative. Although America is a young nation,
she has had so much experience, and has progressed so
much faster than the nations of the Old World, that, if she
could see herself in the mirror of history, she would appear
with a fresh, ruddy face, and a strong frame, but a little
wrinkled and bald about the temples, and with hair which
care and anxiety have turned prematurely gray. But long
life to her, and a high place among the nations 1 and if she
too has become a veteran in her youth, may it be with her as
with our eagle,—only the courage, strength, and wisdom
which she has acquired on her many hard—fought ﬁelds that
entitle her to the name.

6. But I must not ﬁy away from my bird and his story.
They are a ﬁsh-eating family by nature, these Bald-Heads, so
it is not strange that many of their race should have taken
up their abode in the neighborhood of our great lakes, where
ﬁsh are abundant, and that our eaglet should have ﬁrst seen
the light somewhere in the region of Lake Superior. Here,
when quite young, he was taken from the nest in Chippeway
County, by a Chippeway Indian, in the month of July, 1861,

and was sold to a farmer near by for a bushel of com. This
new owner says, that during the few weeks he kept the
eagle he grew very fast and very saucy, and that, whilst
watching his belligerent freaks among his other domestic ani-
mals, the idea one day “struck him like a brick” that his
eagle should go to the war. Acting on this idea, he took
him to Eau Claire, and offered him for sale to Company C
of the Eighth Wisconsin Volunteers.

7. This new companion-in-arms was not accepted without
due consideration. His merits were well weighed. His
eyes, claws, muscles, voice, all underwent examination 5 but
the debate ended in his favor, and the new recruit, having
thus passed muster, was ﬁnally purchased by a citizen of Eau
Claire, and presented to the Company, who received him
with acclamations, and installed him in his place.

8. This place was of no little honor, being next in rank
to that of the regimental ﬂag. Indeed, during the three
years that followed,——that is, to the end of the war,—it came
to take precedence of the ﬂag itself ; for the eagle is our na-
tional emblem; and, with all honor to the tri-colored ﬂag,
the regiment soon came to look upon their eagle as a more
perfect representative yet of every thing for which they were
ﬁghting. So the royal bird became in some sense their lead-
er; and I think it not improbable that “ Rally round the
Eagle, boys I ” was one of their battle-cries.

9. Wherever Company C went, they were sure to be
cheered and welcomed with peculiar enthusiasm. By the
time they arrived at Madison, on their way to active service,

, the novel character of their presiding genius had excited uni-

versal interest, and already they and their eagle enjoyed a
notoriety for which, thus far, the brave fellows were indebted
to the eagle, rather than the eagle to them. That he was in
full sympathy’ with his comrades and the cause in which they
were engaged, was evident from the beginning.

10. W hen Company C, or the Eau Claire Badgers, as they
were then called, marched into Camp Randall, where the
Seventh and part of the Eighth Wisconsin regiments had
already assembled, they and their eagle were received with
an outburst of cheers ; and the men, running to the entrance
of the camp, deﬁled right and left while they passed in, the

musicians playing Yankee Doodle. The eagle, who h.ari
hitherto looked on with majestic gravity, at this moment
seemed inspired with the common enthusiasm, and, seizing
in his beak one of the little ﬂags attached to his perch, he
spread and ﬂapped his wings, and continued these demon‘
.strations until borne to the Colonel’s quarters. It was a sine
Igular fact that he was always, during his continuance in the
service,~similarly affected by any cheering on the part of his

own regiment, but quite indifferent to it when proceeding from

other troops in his Vicinity.

11. It was no wonder that the soldiers were proud of their
eagle, and believed in him as a bird of good omen. The
Eau Claire Badgers henceforward Voted themselves the Eau
Claire.Eagles, and the Eighth Wisconsin was soon known
every where as the Eagle regiment. A

153. While at Madison, the eagle was honored by thou-
sands of visitors of high and low degree. One of the officers
ha.d by this time bestowed on him the name of Old Abe,—a
name dear to the country, and which well becomes the gallant
veteran. He had also been sworn into the United States
service,--a ceremony which consisted in putting around his
neck ribbons of red, white, and blue, and decorating his breast
with a rosette of the same colors. Being now a national
bird, he was furnished at State expense with a new perch,
consisting of a shaft about ﬁve feet long, surmounted by a
shield in the form of a heart, on which the stars and stripes
were painted,‘ and above it a cross—piece on which the eagle
sat. This perch, which was used throughout the war, and is
worn and battered by service, is still preserved by the State
as an army relic.

13. An eagle—bearer was regularly appointed, whose duty
it was to superintend and care for the bird and carry him at
‘the head of the company. This duty devolved on several of
the boys in succession, and was one always eagerly sought
and claimed.’ Company C was also the regimental Coler-
company ; and when the regiment formed in line the eagle
was always on the left of the color—bearer. He shared all the
battles of the regiment, and was exposed to all their perils ;
and yet not only did he escape all injury, but not a color-
bearer or eagle-bearer of the regiment was ever shot down

THE FOURTH READER. 249

Once or twice Old Abe was grazed by a bullet, or had a few
tail-feathers shot away ; but not a drop of his blood was ever
shed in any engagement, and the soldiers were almost justi-
fied in the belief that he had a charmed life.

14. He was not foolhardy, however. I have it on official
authority, that ,“ at the battle of Farmington, May 9th, 1862,
gthe men, being exposed to a galling ﬁre, were ordered to lie
‘brown. The instant they did so, it was impossible to keep
him on his perch. He insisted on being protected as well
as they, and, when liberated, ﬂattened himself on the ground,
and there remained until the men arose, when he resumed his
place of peril, and held it to the close of the contest.”

15. His courage, moreover, was as undoubted as his in—
telligence, and he was every inch a soldier. The colonel of
the regiment testiﬁes that “ upon parade, after he had been a
year in the service, he always gave heed to ‘Az‘z‘em‘z'o7z /’
With his head obliquely to the front, his right eye directly
turned upon the parade-commander, he would listen and obey
orders, noting time accurately. After parade had been dis«
missed and the ranks were being closed by the sergeants, he
would lay aside his soldierly manner, ﬂap his wings, and make
himself generally at home.”

16. When the regiment was forming forbattle, he and the
colors were ﬁrst upon the line. At such times he always
seemed anxious and uneasy, and only assumed composure
when they faced and were ready to march to the combat.
But it was amid the smoke of battle that he was to be seen
in his true glory. Then, with his pinions spread, he would
iump up and down on his perch, and as the artillery volleyed
forth its thunder he would mingle his voice with it in wild

- and fearful screams.

17. Of course his enthusiasm inspired the whole brigade,
who believed that he sounded the trump of victory, and who
vowed that he should never be captured by the enemy. The
bird who proved such an inspiration to the soldiers would
naturally be greatly exposed to Rebel sharp-shooters. At
the battle of Corinth, the Rebel General Price, having dis-

‘ covered him, ordered his men to be sure and take him, if they

could not kill him ; adding, that he would rather get that bird
than the entire brigade.

LXXXIII.—THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.

1. It would be too long a story were I to undertake to
tell you all the journeyings, perils, battles, and sieges to
which our eagle accompanied, or rather led, the Eighth Wisri
consin. E“ Where,” says Mr. Barret, in his history of our bird,
“did the Eagles not go in the Mississippi Valley?” They
endured the dangers and toils of the Red River expedition;
they stormed at Vicksburg ; New Madrid and Island N 0. IO
were inscribed on their banners; nearly half their original
number had found soldiers’ graves 5 but it was their boast
that their eagle never lost a battle. It is their glory now,
that by heroism such as theirs the country itself is saved.

2. You may well believe, that, when at last their perils
were over and their work well done, the Wisconsin Eagles
had a_ triumphant welcome home. There was a public re-
ception in Madison and another in Eau Claire ,' there were
bell—ringings, speeches, and salutes. Finally, the eagle, de-
servedly the chief object of notice to the crowd, was publicly
presented to the Governor, and accepted on behalf of the
State.

Thus the pet and pride of the regiment was transferred to
civil authority, with an assurance from the Governor that he
should be well and carefully provided for, and as safely kept
as possible, as long as he lived.

3. He is supported now at the public expense, in a res-
idence appropriated to him, near the State Armory. Like
any other honored veteran, he is always brought out and
paraded on occasion of every public military exercise or re-
view, and is sure to excite attention and enthusiasm. I am
told that, even in his quiet home at Madison, this brave bird

T is much excited by the report of ﬁre-arms, ﬂapping his wings,

shrieking, and otherwise manifesting his familiarity with their
use. .

4. When in the service, and subjected to the necessities
of camp-life, he had a soldierly indifference in regard to his
diet, and, like many another chivalrous youth of good birth
and breeding, was satisﬁed with the poorest fare. For some

time he lived very contentedly on rats, until ﬁnally he was
bitten by one of these vermin, after which he would never ac-
cept any of the species as an article of food. Since return--
ing to private life, he shows more aristocratic preferences,
and, I am sorry to say, is a dainty fellow. Perhaps. he thinks

himself deserving of some compensation for his hardships,

or is keeping up a perpetual thanksgiving for the country’s
deliverance. At all events, his taste for delicate food is uni»
mistakable, and, a grateful country being disposed to pamper
him, he is fed chieﬂy on live chickens.

5. I trust the majority of our soldiers do not claim similar
compensation, and that the present scarcity of poultry is not
owing to this cause. I would rather believe that our boys
have had a‘ wholesome discipline in hardships, and are more
than satisﬁed with plain living and home fare, be it ever so
homely 3 but we are an extravagant people by nature and
habit, and I am afraid have all a lurking desire for chicken
and tidbits, when they are to be had. A

6. However the case may be in the matter of diet, I was,
while listening to the story of this bird, constantly detecting
a similarity between his traits of character and those of the
nation of which he is a worthy representative and type. For
instance, Old Abe knows his keeper, and is gratefully attach-
ed to him, but is reserved towards strangers, sometimes even
showing ﬁght when they presume to take liberties with him,
or triﬂe with his dignity. Thus, when he is disturbed from
any cause, this keeper may stroke his ruffled feathers and
soothe him by the process, but woe to any foreign or un-
friendly hand that ventures to interfere. I

7. So I need hardly remind even the youngest among you

‘how, in our time of war and difﬁculty, the American nation

refused to be stroked into submission by the rough hand of
John Bull, or the dainty one of his French neighbor, that plausi~
ble Johnny Crapaud‘, but how peaceably the people bent their
neck to the mild paternal hand of our good President Lin-
coln, the keeper and ruler whom we had tried" and knew we

. could trust.

8. It is a ﬁne trait of this Wisconsin Eagle, true bird of
America, that he knows and loves every soldier who has
fought in the great cause. I am told that he always ﬂaps his

252 ANALYTMJAL. ssniss.

wings at sight of a federal uniform, and claims the wearer for
a friend 3 and long may it be before America shall forget any
of the loyal sons who have done her such good service, or
fail to recognize their claims to her gratitude !

9. Nor did our eagle serve the country in the camp and
the ﬁeld alone. He has been an aid to the sick and the
wounded, and as the men, women, and children of the nation
exerted themselves heart and hand to furnish and provide for

'our hospitals, and keep the Sanitary Commission in funds, so _

this benevolent bird had hardly returned from the duties of

his last campaign before he might be found engaged in earn-‘

ing money for the great Chicago Fair, adding no _less than
twenty thousand dollars to the proﬁts of this charitable enter-
prise. ,

10. This sum was realized partly by exhibiting himself to
the crowd of visitors who were eager to make his acquaint-
ance, and partly by the extensive sale of his photograph.
The latter object was mainly accomplished through a sort of
military organization,—boys and girls all over the land being
invited to act as agents for obtaining purchasers, and printed
commissions as officers in the Army of the American Eagle
being served to all who had obtained a certain number of
subscribers for the picture,-—their military rank being pro~
portioned to their success as salesmen. I have by me now a
paper which commissions a boy of my neighborhood as a ﬁrst
lieutenant.

11. ‘Mr. Barnum of New York, who has an eye, you know,
for natural curiosities and celebrities of . every kind, has been
Very anxious to obtain possession of this eagle for the Ameri-
can Museum, and offered for his purchase as large a sum of
money as had been raised through his means at the Chicago
Fair ; but you may well believe the Wisconsin people proud-=
ly refused his offer——as if they could part with such a
trophy, or as if a price could be set on the Bird of Liberty!
Why, even the stray feathers that he chances to shed are
treasured up and prized ,- and my friend, who told us most of
this story, is as proud of his good fortune in possessing one
quill and a few little brush-feathers, as you or I should be of
a bit of the wood of the good ship Cumberland, or a few hairs

of the black horse that carried Sheridan on his famous ride. ,

personal appearance of Old Abe, I must not omit to tell you
that he is a huge fellow, measuring six feet and a half from
tip to tip of his spread wings, and his weight is ten and a
half pounds. As I have mentioned before, he has a beautiful
fringe of white feathers on his head and neck 3 his tail also is
white, spotted with black ;- but the rest of his plumage is a
ﬁne chocolate, with a golden tinge. His legs are bright yel-
low, his talons black and hooked, and his eye——O, but you

LXXXVI.——CHASED BY A RHINOCEROS.

BY MAYN E REID.

Arend was in pursuit of a truant horse when the adventure here de-
scribed took place. It explains his absence from camp, and answers
Groot Willem’s question, (paragraph I 5, page 117,) “What has become
of Arend ?” -

 ,1". Arend followed, increasing his own speed in like pro-
portion. When nearly across the plain, the runaway sudden-
ly stopped and then bolted off at right angles to the course
it had been hitherto pursuing. Arend was astonished, but
soon discovered the cause of this eccentric action, in the
presence of a huge black rhinoceros,——the borelé,—-—which
was making a straight course across the plain, as if on its way
to the river.

2., The runaway horse had shied put of its way ; and it

 would have been well for the horseman if he had shown

himself equally discreet. But Arend Von Wyk was a hunter,

THE FOURTH READER. 2357-

—-—and an ofﬁcer of the Cape Militia,—and as the borelé
passed by him, presenting a ﬁne opportunity for a shot, he
could not resist the temptation to give it one. Pulling up
his horse, or rather trying to do so, for the animal was res-
tive in the presence of such danger, he ﬁred. The shot pro-
.-duced a result that was neither expected nor desired. With

‘ta roar like the bellowing of an angry bull, the monster turned
and charged straight towards the horseman.

3. Arend was obliged to seek safety in ﬂight, while the
borele’ pursued in a manner that told of its being wounded,
but not incapacitated from seeking revenge. At the com-
mencement of the chase, there was but a very short distance
between pursuer and pursued; and in place of suddenly
turning out of the track, and allowing the monster to pass by
him,——which he should have done, knowing the _defect of
vision natural to the rhinoceros,-——the young hunter continued
on in a straight line, all the while employed in reloading
his riﬂe.

4. Suddenly he found his flight arrested .by the thick
scrub of thorny bushes, known in South Africa as the “ wait
a bits ” 3 and the horse he was riding did wait a bit,——-and so
long that the borelé was soon close upon his heels. There
was now neither time nor room to turn.‘ either to the right or
left. The riﬂe was at length loaded, but there would have
been but little chance of killing the rhinoceros by a single
shot, especially with such uncertain aim as could have been
taken from the back of a frightened horse.

5. Arend, therefore, threw himself from the saddle. He
had a twofold purpose in doing so. His aim would be more
correct, and there was the chance of the borelé keeping on

’ after the horse, and leaving him an undisturbed spectator of

the chase. The ﬁeld of view embraced by the eyes of a
rhinoceros is not large 3 but, unfortunately for the hunter, 
the frightened horse ﬂed from his side, it was he himself
that came within the circumscribed circle of the borele”s
vision. Hastily raising the riﬂe to his shoulder he ﬁred at
the advancing enemy, and then ﬂed towards a clump of

’ trees that chanced to be near by.
6. He could hear the heavy tread of the rhinoceros as it p .

followed close upon his heels. It seemed to shake the earth.

Arrow, alley, (mic, ebbing, eelcl;/. In most words con«
taining a double consonant, only one of the _two is uttered :
there is no word in which both are clearly heard. Yet,
in pronouncing some words, we dwell a moment on the
consonant, and then give a new impulse to ﬁnish it; thus,
miaggoell, goenl-:n.ife, heacl-clress, 7/nnerve. In the phonic
writing of such words, two consonants should be repre-
sented, and in oral analysis two should be uttered; thus,

Closer and closer he heard it, so near that he dared not

i stop to look around. He fancied he could feel the breath of

the monster blowing upon his back. His only chance was to
make a sudden deviation from his course, and leave the
borelé to pass on in its impetuous charge. This he did,
turning sharply to the right, when he saw that he had just
escaped being elevated upon the creature’s horn.

7. This maneuver enabled him to gain some distance as

he started off in the new direction. But it was not long I

maintained, for the borele’ was again in hot pursuit, without
any show of fatigue, while the tremendous exertions he had
himself been making rendered him incapable of continuing
his flight much longer. He had just sufﬁcient strength left to
avoid an immediate encounter by taking one more turn,
when, fortunately, he saw before him the trunk of a large
baobab tree lying prostrate along the ground. It had been
blown down by some mighty storm, and lay resting upon its
roots at one end, and its shivered branches at the other, so
as to leave a space of about two feet between its trunk and
the ground.

8. Suddenly throwing himself down, Arend glided under
the tree, just in time to escape the long horn, whose point
had again come in close proximity with his posteriors. The

hunter had now time to recover his breath, and, to some ex-

tent, his conﬁdence. He saw that the fallen tree would pro-
tect him. Even should the rhinoceros come round to the
other side, he would only have to roll back again to place
himself beyond the reach of its terrible horn. The space
below was ample enough to enable him to pass through, but
too small for the body of a borelé. By creeping back and
forward he could always place himself in safety. And this
was just what he had to do ; for the enraged monster, on see-
ing him on the other side, immediately ran round the roots,
and renewed the attack.

9. This course of action was several times repeated before

A the young hunter was allowed much time for reflection. He

was in hopes that the brute would get tired of the useless
charges it was making, and either go away itself, or give him
the opportunity. In this hope he was doomed to disappoint-
ment. The animal, exasperated with the wounds it had re-

THE FOURTH READER. 259

ceived, appeared implacable ; and for more than an hour it
kept running around the tree in vain attempts to get at him.
As he had very little trouble in avoiding it, there was plenty
of opportunity for. reﬂection ; and he passed the time in
devising some plan to settle the misunderstanding between
the borelé and himself. ‘

10. The first he thought of was to make use of his riﬂeé.
The weapon was within his reach where he had dropped it
when diving under the tree; but when about to reload it, he
discovered that the ramrod was missing! S0 sudden had
been the charge of the borelé, at the time the riﬂe was last
loaded, that the ramrod had not been returned to its proper
place, but left behind upon the plain. This was an unlucky
circumstance 3 and for a time the young hunter could not think
of anything better than to keep turning from side to side, to
avoid the presence of the besieger.

11. The borelé at last seemed to show signs of exhaus-
tion, or, at all events, began to perceive the unproﬁtable

nature of the tactics it had been pursuing. But the spirit of ,

revenge was not the least weakened within it, for it made no
move toward taking its departure from the spot. On the
contrary, it lay down by the baobab in a position to Command
a View on both sides of the huge trunk, evidently determined
to stay there and await the chance of getting within reach of
its victim. Thus silently beleaguered, the young hunter set
about considering in what manner he might accomplish the
raising of the siege. 

12. The sun went down,,the moon ascended above the
tops of the surrounding trees, yet the borelé seemed no less

inspired by the spirit of revenge than on ﬁrst receiving the

injuries it was wishing to resent. For many hours the young
hunter waited patiently for it to move away in search of food
or any other object except that of revenge 3 but in this hope
he was disappointed. The pain inﬂicted by the shots would
not allow either hunger or thirst to interfere with the desire
for retaliation, and it continued to maintain a watch so vigi-

_ lant that Arend dared not leave his retreat for an instant.

Whenever he made a movement, the enemy did the same.
13. It was a long time before he could think of any plan
that would give him a chance of getting away. One at

260 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

length occurred to him. Although unable to reload the riﬂe
with a bullet, the thought came into his mind, that the
borele’ might be blinded by a heavy charge of powder, or so
confused by it as to give him an opportunity of stealing away.
This seemed an excellent plan, yet so simple that Arend was
somewhat surprised he had not thought of it before.

14. Without difficulty he succeeded in pouring a double
quantity of powder into the barrel ; and, in order to keep

it there until he had an opportunity for a close shot, some

dry grass was forced into the muzzle. The chance soon
offered ; and, taking a deliberate aim at one of the borelé’s
eyes with the muzzle of the gun not more than two feet from
its head, he pulled trigger. With a loud moan of mingled
rage and agony, the rhinoceros rushed towards him, and
frantically, but vainly exerted all its strength in an endeavor
to overturn the baobab. “One more shot at the other eye,”
thought Arend, “and I shall be free.”

15. He immediately proceeded to pour another close of
powder into the riﬂe, but while thus engaged a new danger

' suddenly presented itself. The dry gra.ss projected from

the gun had ignited and set ﬁre to the dead leaves that were
strewed plentifully over the ground. In an instant these
were ablaze, the ﬂame spreading rapidly on all sides, and
moving towards him. The trunk of the baobab could no
longer afford protection. In another minute it, too, wouldbe
enveloped in the red ﬁre, and to stay by its side would be to
perish in the ﬂames. There was no alternative but to get
to his feet and run for his life.

16. Not a moment was to be lost, and, slipping from
under the tree, he started off at the top of his speed. The
chances were in his favor for escaping unobserved by the
rhinoceros. But fortune seemed decidedly against him.
Before getting twenty paces from the tree, he saw that he
was pursued. Guided either by one eye or its keen sense
of hearing, the monster was following him at a pace so rapid

' that, if long enough continued, it must certainly overtake him.

17. Once more the young hunter began to feel some‘
thing like despair. Death seemed hard upon his heels. A

few seconds more, and he might be impaled on that terrible __

horny. But for that instinctive love of life which all feel, he

THE FOURTH READER. 261

might have surrendered himself to fate; but urged by this,
he kept on. He was upon the eve of falling to the earth
through sheer exhaustion, when his ears were saluted by the
deep—toned bay of a hound, and close after it a voice ex—
claiming,-—“ Look out, Baas Willem! Somebody come yon-
der ! ”

18. Two seconds more and Arend was safe from further
pursuit. The hound Spoor’em was dancing about the borele”s
head, and by his loud, angry yelps diverting its attention
from every thing but himself. Two seconds more and Groot
Willem and Hendrik came riding up ; and, in less thanhalf
a minute after, the monster, having received a shot from a
heavy riﬂe, slowly settled down in its tracks—a dead rhi'
noceros. ‘

DIRECTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS.

Good reading is telling in the best way what the
‘writers of the pieces wished to say, and how they felt,
when they wrote them. .

To read well, therefore, you must not only pronounce
the words correctly, but you must so speak them that the
meaning of the writer, and the way he felt, will be made

‘ plain to any one that hears you.

Now, there are different ways of feeling and thinking;
and so there are different tones of voice for expressing

2

26 ANALYTICAL snnrns.

feelings and thoughts. When a boy is angry, his voice
sounds Very diﬁ"erent from what it does when he is speak-
ing kindly to his little brother or sister. And when a
little girl receives a beautiful doll for a Christmas present
and tells about it, she speaks very differently from what
she does when the doll falls into the ﬁre and is burnt.
ion see, then, that different feelings require different tones
voice.

In how many different ways can we speak ? We may
speak louol or softly; slowly or rapidly. This is easy to
understand. We call the difference between speaking
loud and speaking softly a diﬁerence in Force; andthat
between speaking rapidly and speaking slowly a difference
in Speed. But we may also speak with a lziglz, or a low
Pitch. A grown up man speaks with a much. lower pitch
than a woman or a little boy. The sounds of a bass-Viol
are of lower pitch than those of a violin, and the low bass
strings of a piano have a lower pitch than the high ones.
So that we have three kinds of diﬁbrences in Reading and
Speaking,——a diﬁerence in Force, in Speed, and in Pitch.
There are other differences in ways of speaking, about
which you will learn by and by.

Now, when you are about to read any piece, you must
ask yourself whether it ought to he read loud or softly,
slowly or rapidly, with a high pitch or a low pitch. This
will depend entirely upon the meaning of what is read,
and the feelings to be expressed.

‘When We are saying or reading something that is not
at all exciting, we do not speak very loud nor very softly,
but with moderate Force. In such cases also we use
moderate Pitch and moderate Speed. When one is angry,
or indignant, or wishes to express deﬁance, or great joy, he
speaks loud, or uses great Force.

In expressing kindness and affection, or pity, you
speak,so'ftly, or use little Force. You do the same when
you feel sad. I _ _ '

“Then we are joyous, or cheerful, or are describmg
something in a very animated way, we speak rapidly, or
with great Speed. But when we are sad, or saying very
solemn things, or Very grand and noble things, we speak
slowly. A _

And in joy or cheerfulness we are, apt to use a high
Pitch, but in expressing solemn thoughts, or very sad
ones, we speak with a low Pitch. -

Sometimes we need to speak in a clear voice; at other

THE FOURTH READER. 27

times in a whisper, or partly in a. whisper. When one is
frightened, but not suﬂiciently to make him scream, he
naturally speaks in a hoarse whisper. But in describing
beautiful or noble things, we must use clear tones.

EMPHASIS.

If you listen carefully to a good reader, you will notice
that he pronounces some words louder than others, and
dwells upon them longer; that is, he gives them more
force and more time than ordinary words. This is because
the thoughts they express are important or new. In read-
ing, you need to be careful to ﬁnd what thoughts are new
or most important, and to speak the words expressing
them with more force and length of sound than other words.
This is called Emphasis, and the words spoken in this way

i are said to be Em}?/ta2f27c.— Many people are careless about-

emphasis, and that makes it Very difficult to get the.meau-
ing of what they are reading.

PAUSES.

The little marks,-—commas, semicolons, periods, &e.,-——
that you see in books, are to help you in getting the mean-
ing of what is printed. They do not show just how long
you are to pause at the places where they are. You often
need to pause in reading where none of these marks are
found, and sometimes you must not pause where they are.
By carefully thinking of what you are reading, and striv-
ing to make the meaning clear to others, you will be very
likely to ﬁnd out where you ought to pause. You must
also look forward to the words, and see them ‘some time
before you have to pronounce them. This will make you

_ ready to pronounce them when the time comes.

Pieces that need to be read slowly require long pauses;
those that are to be read with moderate Speed should
have the pauses of moderate length ; and in the pieces that

are to be read fast the pauses must be short. Look back '

to page 26 and see what kind of pieces these are.

The pauses after emphatic words are longer than after
other words. You remember that two things are neces-
sary to make a word emphatic,——loudness, and length of
time. A part of this time is used in pausing after the
Word. -

In reading poetry, you must be careful not to make

the pauses at the ends of the lines too long, or to make
them all alike. This would be reading in a “ sing-song ”

style. Children often read in this way, and the sound of

such reading is very disagreeable. But you must ascer-
tain from the sense where the pauses must be made, and
how long they must ‘be. Some pause, however, is re-
quired at the end of each line, but it must be very sliglw,
except where the sense calls for a longer one.

INFLECTIONS.

If you listen to a person as he asks a question that you
could answer by saying “ yes ” or “ no,” and then listen
to the answer, you will observe what are called an up-
ward and a downward Slide or Inﬂection of the voice.
If I say to a boy, “ John, are you learning your grammar
lesson ? ” he may answer, “ No, I am writing a let-
ter ; ” you notice that in the question the pitch suddenly
rises as you pronounce the word “ grammar,” and that in
the answer it suddenly falls on the word “ letter.” The
first is called the Rising Inﬂection, and the second the
Falling Inﬂection.

VVe use the falling inﬂection in stating any thing
that is important, and that we feel sure about, or in ex-
pressing a determination when our mind is fully made up.
If you say, “A studious boy will learn,” you say some-
thing which is important, and which you know to be true.

‘You therefore say it with the falling inﬂection. You do

the same when you command something to be done, or
give serious advice. Try these sentences: “ James, bring
me the book.” “My son, you must not fall into bad
company.” I

But when we are in a doubtful state of mind, or wait-
ing to know something, we are apt to speak with the
rising slide; thus, we ask questions that can be answered

by “yes” or “ no”, or express our doubt of something ~

that is said to us. If a person should tell me that an old
friend Whom I had not seen for twenty years was in the
next room waiting to see me, I might say, “ He is ! ”——-with
the rising inﬂection, because I might ﬁnd it hard to be-
lieve.

When you utter a long sentence in which the main
thought comes near the end, you speak all the previous
parts of it with the rising inﬂection. Try this sentence:
“ If I were on the ice and had been skating some time,

THE FOURTH READER. 29

and should see a poor boy, greatly troubled because he had
no skates, and should lend him mine, I should feel happier

_ for it.” Now if you say this sentence over carefully, you

will see that each of the statements in it has the rising in-
ﬂection until you come to the statement, “ I should feel
happier for it.” This is the main statement, and requires
the falling inﬂection.

If after making a statement, you add another that
weakens it, the last statement is spoken with the rising
slide. If I say, “Alice is an admirable girl, but she is

careless,” the last statement weakens the other,-—Alice is ‘

not so admirable a girl as if she were not careless. The
last statement must therefore be spoken with the rising
inﬂection.

Sometimes we use both inﬂ_ections on the same sound,
one followingithe other. This is called the Circumﬂex.
When the ﬁrst part of the sound is given with the falling
inﬂection and the last part with the rising, it is called the
rising circumﬂex; when the rising inflection comes ﬁrst
and the falling last, it is called, the falling circumﬂex.
Suppose a boy, seeing a very large ﬂock of sheep, should
say, “There are a hundred sheep!” Another, knowing
more about the number, might answer, “ A hundred
sheep ! There are at least a thousand.” The word “hun-
dred” on being repeated, would have the rising circum-
ﬂex. Repeat this sentence a great many times until you
get full control of the rising circumﬂex.

A boy may think another boy better treated than him-
self, and say ironically, “I am only a good-for-nothing,
but John is perfect.” “I ” and “ John ” require the rising
circumﬂex, and “ good-for-nothing” and “perfect” re-
quire the falling circumﬂex.

You will notice that the circumﬂexes are never used in
statements that are entirely straightforward. There is
always something understood that is not said. In the
case about the sheep, when the boy repeats the words,
“A hundred sheep,” he says them in such a way as to make
them mean that there are many more than a hundred.
Say “A hundred sheep” with the rising circumﬂex on
“hundred, ” and think what the meaning is. Try also
“ John is perfect,” giving “ John ” the rising circumﬂex,
and “perfect ” the falling. Would a person speaking in
this way mean just what the words seem to mean? In
using the circumﬂexes, then, something is meant that is
not expressed by the words.

EXAMPLES FOR ELooUTroNARY DRILL

WE now wish to apply the principles and rules which we
have been learning, and for that purpose the pupil is re-
quested to study carefully the following pieces, and the ex-
planations that are placed before them.

Theﬁrst is the song of the Skaters. It is full of joy and
spirit. In reading it, you are to imagine yourself on the ice
with the laughing, shouting company. Say “ Hurrah I Hur-
rah!” just as you would if you were throwing up your hat
and shouting out of doors. You must use great force, high
pitch, and rapid speed. Look back to the explanations and
see what these things mean. Be careful, too, about the in-
flections and the emphases. Study what is said about them

in the explanations, and then ﬁnd out what words in the _,

piece require emphasis, and what inﬂections the different

«sentences require.

With what inﬂection should you say “ Hurrah” ?

 

I.—THE SKATERS.

apply to it.)

The winter winds are sleeping ;
The moon above the steeple tall,

A silver crescent, over all,

And need not breathe, by night or day,
A sigh for summer pleasure 5

The merry bells ring gayly out,

Our lips keep time with song and shout,
And laugh in happy measure.

We sweep as sea—birds skim the main,
Our pulses gayly leaping ;

The stars are bright, the track is white,
There’s joy in ev’ry heart to—night,
While winter winds are sleeping.

The next selection is very different from the other two.‘
It requires soft tones and medium pitch, and must be spoken
slowly. Some of the inflections require particular care.
For instance, “love,” in the second line, requires the falling
inflection, and “ fear” the rising. Study the explanations,
page 28, and see whether this is in agreement with them.
You will notice that a positive declaration is made about
“love,” but about “ fear” there ‘is a kind of denial. All the
commands or entreaties must have the falling inﬂection.
How many of these are there? Point them out.‘ You also
need to use clear tones, or pure quality, in reading this piece,
because the sentiments expressed are beautiful and good.

6. Speak gently 3 Love doth whisper low

The fourth example, “ The New Year,” is somewhat like

the ﬁrst and second. Y But it is more serious than either of »
them. Like “The Skaters” and “ The Sleighing Song,” it ‘

requiresmuch force ; but the force is softened and subdued
by the solemn character of the thoughts. It does not, there-
fore, require the mere joyous shouting of the other two, but a
strong and vigorous expression of something that is Very im-
portant and not at all triﬂing. It must, therefore, be spoken
more slowly than the ﬁrst and second pieces. It requires,
then, great force, rather high pitch, slow speed. Be sure
that you understand the meaning of each of the stanzas.
Some of them are a little difficult. Does the poet wish the

A New Year to be in all respects like the Old Year? Name

over all the changes he wishes to see.

cold shoulder, is now coming back to it again, and rejoices
in longer days and a renewir 1g sunlight.

“ The days begin to lengthen,
And the cold begins to strengthen,”

it is true. But the growing plants that I mean to tell of
care little for the cold. The lengthening sunlight warms
them in their close buds, and stirs the young germs that are
to make their ﬁrst appearance in the spring. They do not
think of minding the weather. The oak stands hardily
against the storm, and the elm sways its long branches
gracefully in the wind, and the sturdy pines look glad and
green.

3. Before we set out on the winter’s walks that are to tell

-us of trees and buds, here is one tree that has come into the

parlor that we must stop for. “A tree in the parlor!”
Yes, for surely you can not already have forgotten the
CHRISTMAS-TREE. This tree belongs to the cone-éearzkzg
family, but, as we have seen it, its fruit has been far more
various! There were rosy apples, and bags of nuts, and
sugar-plums, and shining glass globes, red, blue, and green.

4. What fruit there was indeed 1 You have not forgotten
yet the dolls,-—waX dolls and china ones, and those whose
eyes would open and shut. There were boxes of soldiers,
with their cannon and tents. Many reviews and battles you
have had with them already ; and, alas I by this time many
are lost or on the list of the wounded. A general, perhaps,
in the crack behind the great trunk in the play-room, a
sergeant with only one arm ; one or two down the furnace
register ,- and the bravest lieutenant of all thrown by Bridget,
before your very eyes, into the hottest of the ﬁre in the
grate! .

5. Ah, well, tears do not become the brave, so think again
of the Christmas—tree, how it shone with candles on every
bough! The tree itself looked like a great chandelier.
That was in the midst of our shortest days, and the shining
candles were calling to the sun to come back to us again.

6. But it is only once a year that our Christmas-tree
bears such gay fruit as this, and if we begin to tell over the

guns, and the wooden horses, and the picture-books, and the ,

mon, on one of the squares, or we can linger by this little
strip of ﬂower—border by the door; or, more adventurous
still, we will take the cars, and start from home, out of town,
where we can see the winter landscape in all its beauty.

8. In all its sameness, you want to say, if you know only
the dripping of the melted ice from the roofs, and the muddy
snow that clogs the streets, and the glimpse of .a leaden sky
that you get between the houses. That is the way the
grown-up folks at home talk. But boys and girls know bet-
ter. Winter and snow tell them of sleds and skates, of
coasting and skating, of snow-balls and snow-men, and long,
glittering icicles. So you will not be surprised at the beauty
of the winter landscape that meets us.

' 9. Before the house, rises a high hill, covered with trees.
Let us climb over it and look down. What an enchanted
country lies before us, all still and silent 1 Every thing glis-
tens as in an Arabian Nights’ tale. All the million little
twigs are covered with a soft snow, and last night’s mist thick-
ened and turned into ice upon the trees. Yet, heavily laden
as the trees are, we can still recognize some of our acquaint-

that the asters held are turned into clusters of diamonds,
and the high grasses hold up long scepters of shiny glass

quiet now ! _We have come out from the silence to a noisy,

thous_an_ds of slender insects whirled round in wild circles
over the smooth mirror of water that they never succeeded
in touching. Now men, women, and children circle about

ice has made safe for them.

was once a little brook, but is now a narrow ice—path, that
leads us into the woods,—into the thick woods, that shake
down crystals upon us, and heavy balls of frozen snow.
Ah! if they only would not melt away in the warmth, what

we might dress ourselves with them for a dance !

in ! I am afraid they would disturb him in his winter’s nap.
Yet surely he has earned a good sleep after all that work.
Which one of you has done as much for his winter’s comfort?

« But boys know every thing, and I dare say could tell me a

great deal about the muskrats, and about this very house.

VIII.—l-THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.

, 1. Wait but a day, andthe sun has carried off the jewels
from our pines, and we can take another walk to visit them.
But which are the pines? Are all the evergreens pines,--our
Christmas-tree, these cone-shaped trees in our grounds, and the
leaﬂess larch? They are all of the pine family——the mmfer(e,——
the cone-bearing family of which I have spoken. The Ger-
mans have a pretty way of describing this family. They call
them the 7z.em’Ze-trees,-—tl1ose that have narrow, pointed leaves,

like needles.

2. It was one of this family, in the German story, you
know,.that wanted to change its needles into “truly” leaves,
like those of the oak and the elm. But glad enough was the

44 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

dissatisﬁed tree to come back to its needles again, and very
much should we miss them if all the pines and ﬁrs~ and
spruces should choose to lay aside their needles, and dress
themselves like the other trees. We should lose their green,
that lasts us all the winter long. The larch is the only one of
this family that mimics the other families of trees, and sheds
its leaves in the winter.

3. We can tell the different kinds of this family by the
different effect the position of theirbranches gives them at
a distance. The white pine has its regular horizontal stages.
We have seen how it spreads them, to hold the snow. The
pitch-pine bears round, tufted masses. The spruce begins
from the very ground to conceal its gradually sloping trunk.
The Aﬁr rises with a tall, sloping shaft, “clean” from the
ground for some distance. Its lower branches are horizontal,
while the upperones bend slightly upwards. The hemlock
has a soft, delicate outline, and the cedars and junipers are
more ragged and very picturesque.

4. Of these, our White Pine stands ﬁrst,-—for it is the
most stately tree of our forests, varying in its outward
appearance, and receiving different names according to the
place it grows in. We see it frequently, left standing near
our towns, its dark green in the summer forming a contrast
to the other trees around,——a picture of powerful growth ; or,
farther away in the country, its dark color is prominent
against the soft green of the wild cherry—tree, or its trunk
serves as a support for the bitter—sweet and other trailing
Vines.

5. No wonder that Emerson says :

“ Who leaves the pine tree
Leaves his friend,
Unnerves his strength,
Invites his end.”

For now in the winter this tree seems like a trusty friend,
stretching out his sheltering arms, a type of a strong con-
stancy. T

6. It is easily distinguished by its leaves, being in ﬁves ;
that is, each one of its slender little needles does not rise
separately from the branch, but, with four needle-like com-

as

THE FOURTH READER. 45

panions, comes out of a little gray sheath. These sheaths,
each bearing its ﬁve needles, are set closely round the twig.
A single large bud, encircled by ﬁve smaller ones, is at the
end of each branch. .  

'7. The branches, as we have said, grow in regular stages
or whorls, of about ﬁve at each stage, tending upwards when
the tree is young, but in old trees horizontal. It is not the
season to examine its ﬂowers, which, indeed, at any time are
indistinct. Has it any ﬂowers? Who ever saw the ﬂowers
of such great old trees? you ask. Every plant must have its
ﬂower, its blossom, because from them comes the fruit or
seed. And the essential parts of a ﬂower are not its showy,
its pretty part. The important parts, those which must
never fail in ca ﬂower, because they produce the seed, are the
stamens and pistils. These we shall have a chance tostudy
when the ﬂower season comes.

8. In all the pine family the ﬂower is very incomplete;
even the important pistil has not all its parts, but appears
like a mere scale. Besides, the pistils are in one part of the
tree, and the stamens in another. So there are two sets of
ﬂowers, one to hold the pistils, called the ]>z'sz‘z°Z[az‘e ﬂowers,

and another to hold the stamens, called the sz‘amz'mzz‘e ﬂowers. ’

In the white pine the pistillate ﬂowers are in erect cones on
the ends of the uppermost branches, and appear in June.
These do not, ripen into fruit till the autumn of the second
year. It is the ripe cones that give the name to this family

‘ and distinguish it.

9. Here are more pines. Are they white pines? Take
hold of a branch and count its needles. You will see that
there are only three in a sheath, where the white pine had
ﬁve, and they are ﬂatter in shape. . Each tree, too, is more
irregular in form, and this tree never reaches the height of
the white pine. It is the Pitch Pine. It makes up many of
the woods that we call the “ pine woods,” and that invite us‘
with their healthy smell.

10. Come in and listen to the pleasant sighing of the
wind through the leaves. There is a warm, comfortable feel-
ing here, even in these winter days, for the thick branches
have kept the snow from the brown tasseled ground, and we
are sheltered from the cold winds. Here and there a stream

O

46 ' ANALYTICAL SERIES.

of sunlight comes in, and lights up a red tinge in the brown,
soft carpet, and we can venture to linger awhile and listen to
the story the wind is whispering to the pines. The brown
empty cones lie scattered about.

11. “O, we have picked thousands of 1 them,” you ‘say.
But did you ever consult them about the weather? In damp
seasons the scales of the cones drink in the moisture. This
makes them swell and close up. When it is dry again, they
open gradually. So you see they are little weather-prophets.
A part of the scale of the pistil of which I have spoken
makes a wing that ﬂies away with the seed when it is ripe.
The cones of some of the pines require two or three years
to come to perfection.

12. A cart-path leads us among trees that are leafy in
summer, by snow-covered bushes, to a favorite summer resting-
place under a tall hemlock. It is the hemlock-spruce, or hem-
lock of the spruce genus. It may fairly be called the most
beautiful tree of the family, and we ﬁnd a cool shelter in the
summer beneath it, in a soft corner of the rocks at its feet.

13. Far up in the branches sound the gay voices of the
birds, not far off the note of the thrush,—Wilson’s thrush.
But there are dreams of the summer as we look up its tall,
ﬁrm trunk. Its foliage, even now, is soft and delicate, and
it is distinguished from the spruce by its slender, tapering
little branches and smooth limbs. Here in the forest its
lower limbs are stiff and broken.

14. The names of spruce and ﬁr are used with a bewilder-
ing uncertairity, and in the shrubs in our gardens which stand
in either genus there is resemblance enough to create much
doubt. The leaves of both differ much from the pines we

vhave just described. They are solitary; that is, we no

longer ﬁnd them collected in ﬁves, threes, or twos, and a
sheath, but they rise directly from the twig, closely, side by
side. The leaves too are shorter than those of the pines,
and more ﬂat. They are more like a little sword than a
needle, and some have three sides and some four.

15. The spruce in the beginning of summer puts on a
fresh tuft of yellowish-green leaves at the end. of each twig,
and its branches are so numerous, that its young delicate
green gives a great beauty. In the very ornamental shrub in

THE FOURTH READER. 47

our grounds the lower branches spread close to the ground,
and from these a regular pyramid of whorls of leaves rises
to the tapering summit. It was from among them that we
took our Christmas—tree. Its shelf—like branches offered cozy
places for playthings enough to last till next Christmas.

16. On these branches, in the summer, the robins and
other birds ﬁnd pleasant shelter of a rainy day. These are
their piazzas and balconies, where they can take exercise
when it is too stormy outside. Its leaves, as I have said, are
small and ﬂat, and sow themselves along the sides .of the
stalk, forming a ﬂatter branch than that of the ﬁr, and more
like a hand spread out. Its staminate ﬂowers are near the
end of the smaller branches. In the hemlock—spruce the cones
that have borne the fertile ﬂowers are long and pointed, of a

light-brown color, and hang from the extremities of the I

branches. ’

PREFACE.

THIS book has been prepared for the use of classes in
grammar and intermediate schools. It is made to con-
form to the principles adopted in the Analytical Series.
These principles, it is thought, have successfully borne
the test of actual use in the recitation-room, and they
are recommended to educators with renewed conﬁdence.

One of these principles is, that the foundation of all
eﬁ"orts in reading should be a thorough appreciation of
the thoughts and emotions expressed in what is read.
Vocal expression must take its character from the mean-
ing it is to convey.

But the necessity for vocal drill and voice-culture is
fully recognized. Every book in the series aims to pre-
sent some of the best examples for such drill.

The recent improvement in the character of literature

for the young, has enabled the compiler to make selec-

tions for this book, unequaled, it is believed, by those of
any similar book now before the public, both in their
general merits as literary productions, and in their adapt-
edness to the ‘purpose of teaching reading. Among the
selections, however, are many old pieces of sterling merit.

Appended to many of the selections will be found sug-

gestions and questions intended to assist in developing

48 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

fX;——THE SAME SUBJECT CONCLUDED.

1. Here is another tall tree with tapering trunk. Can
this be a spruce or a pine? It is a tree that commands
our attention at a distance, and gives character to the whole
landscape. It is the tree that forms a great feature in the
German forests, and it reigns especially in the famous Black
Forest, where all the dwarfs and the elves of the German
stories are to be found. I can almost fancy I see one of the
little elves now sitting astride one of its cones high in the
air. This tree is the Balsam Fir.

2. Reach down some of its leaves, and you will see how
they differ from the spruce. They are broader, and look as
if they might be formed of two grown together. They are
more crowded, too, than those of the spruce. Starting on
every side of the stem, they bend upwards where the branch
is horizontal, so as to seem to form but two rows, but are
pressed together on the upper side. In the bark lies con-
cealed some of the peculiar balsam of the ﬁr, that spreads a
pleasant fragrance. Their beauty arises from the regularity
of their symmetrical heads. The trunk, too, is perfectly even
and straight, and tapers rapidly to the top.

3. It cuts in upon the landscape with its nearly horizontal
branches, giving a picturesque character wherever it appears.
Even if some bird or insect has greedily eaten up its leading
shoot, which constitutes the pride of all the members of this
family, the two buds on either side of the leading bud vie
with each other in growing, till they form a double header,
and the tree, though- not so symmetrical, is equally pictur-
esque. The cones are erect near the ends of the upper
branches, tapering a little, with the ends rounded. They
stand in great numbers, and with their purple scales look
like a cluster of candles on a majestic chandelier.

4. Do not tell me that you have picked its cones, for I
shall be forced, though reluctantly, to contradict you. The
cones of the pine and the spruce set free the seeds they con—
ceal, which have little wings to carry them out into the world,
and then, with all their scales perfect, they drop to the

THE FOURTH READER. 49

ground. But in the cones of the ﬁr the scales and the seeds
fall away together, and leave on the tree only the tapering
little spike round which they were formed. Therefore, to ﬁnd
a perfect ﬁr cone you must be adventurous enough to climb
the tree, or else cut it down.

5. Which of these trees could we spare from the land-
scape ? If we call the white pine the king of our woods, the
hemlock should stand for the queen, and a group of balsam
ﬁr would answer for the princes. The pines and the ﬁrs
stand as sentinels along the lines of the hills, guarding the
valleys,—the pines solitary watchmen, the ﬁrst clambering
up in bands, while the hemlock lingers in the woods, or sends
its foreign cousins into our gardens and grounds, or the
squares and parks of our cities. The Norway spruce, which
is very ornamental, and is cultivated in this way, is a cousin
of the balsam ﬁr. ts cones are large and light brown, and
pendent. Its leaves differ from those of the cultivated
spruces, as they are not arranged so ﬂatly on the stem, but
the leaves are crowded on the twigs, and the twigs on the
branches. .

6. I must not forget one peculiarity of this pine family:
it is, that they have no hesitation about telling their age!
The oaks and the maples, the trees of the “ truly leaf” sort,
are not so outspoken. After they are dead, by their works
you can tell their age ; after cutting across their trunks, you
can count the rings that year after year they have formed
round the center. But the pines tell their history as they
grow. ‘They form each year a fresh whorl of leaves.

7. Thus each year’s growth is marked between each
whorl of branches ; so, by counting the stages of branches,
you can reckon the life of the tree. And its history is further
told by the varying length of the trunk between the branches,
or of the branches themselves. If this space is smaller, if
the branches are shorter than they should be, or the needles
snorter, thenyou know there. was a year of famine, there was
a want of rain, or a late frost checked the young buds.

8. To this family, too, belonged the trees of the old coal
period. For all the black mines of coal were once stately
trees ; but ages have passed away, burying them up in earth,
far under the ground, changing them from growing trees into

stone. What a change indeed! It took such a long, long
time, too. Do you think that the pine-wood kindlings that
we bring in and lay in the grate to light up the ﬁre with,
recognize their very great-great—grandfathers in the shining
black stones of coal that they are to kindle into a ﬂame ?

9. It is very hard to leave this family. I have told you
a very little about three of its principal members. There
are, besides, the Arbor Vitae, the Cedars, the Juniper, the

Cypresses, and the Yew. I shall have to leave them for you i

to study yourselves. You must go to the sea—shore" and look
at the Red Cedar, (it belongs to the junipers,) and the Juni-
per itself, and see how the branches contort themselves
against the salt breeze. They are stout fellows. I think
they must learn a little of their ﬁrmness from the great rocks
that they clasp with their roots. The needles of the cedar
spread themselves out to look like a fan—like leaf, and the
juniper puts on purplish berries. Beaten by the Winds, they
look as if they had lived forever, with their torn trunks and
ragged limbs, but they keep sever green still. -

10. The juniper-tree is clear to children, from the old
German story of the step-mother and the juniper-tree. And
they can smell the red cedar, in the wood of the pencils they
use. Such a useful family as this is! I must leave you to
recall to yourselves how the pines furnish the tall masts for
our ships. Far away in the harbors of foreign cities these tall
masts stand like another forest. The hemlock and larch

‘ furnish bark for tanning. The Indian cuts his canoe from

the white spruce. The ﬁrs give healing balsams. Pitch,
resins, balsams,—these are the spices that ﬂavor our North-
ern woods. - -

11. You see how little I have been able to tell, and how
mubh there is to tell, how much for you to look at and ﬁnd
out for yourselves. You do not know these trees yet 3 you
have only made their acquaintance, and can bow to them
when you meet them in the street. If you shake hands with
a pine, you can look and see whether he has two, three, or
ﬁve needles in his sheath, and will know accordingly whether
he is red, black, or white pine. But don’t fancy you know a
great deal, and “set up” upon it, else you will show you
have not got so far as to understand the meaning of the say-

XI.—HOW JOHNNY BOUGHT A SEWING-MACHINE.
HORATIO ALGER, JR.

1. Just across the street from the Methodist Church, in

. the principal street of Benton, is a small one—story house,

consisting of three rooms only. This is occupied by Mrs.
Cooper, a widow, and her only son Johnny, with whom it is
our purpose to become further acquainted. 'When the Great
Rebellion broke out, Johnny’s father was one of the first to
enlist. It was a great trial to him to leave behind his wife
and son, but he felt it his duty to go. For more than a year

A he wrote cheerful letters home 3 but one dark day there

came over the wires tidings of the disastrous battle of Fred-

-ericksburg, and in the list of killed was the name of James

Cooper.

54 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

2. It was a sad day for Mrs. Cooper ,- but she had little
time to mourn. The death of her husband threw the burden
of maintaining herself and Johnny upon her shoulders. After
a while she obtained a pension of eight dollars a month,
which helped her considerably. One half of it paid her rent,
and the other half paid for her fuel and lights. But it costs
a good deal to buy food and clothes for two persons, and she
was obliged to toil early and late with her needle to make up

the requisite sum. Johnny was now eleven years old, and‘
might have obtained a chance to peg shoes in some of the

shoe—shops in the village, as indeed he wanted to do, but
Mrs. Cooper felt that he ought to be kept at school. - As she
would not be able to leave him money, she was resolved at
least togive him as good an education as the village schools
would allow. J

3. One evening, just after tea, Mrs. Cooper laid down her
Work with a little sigh. “Johnny,” said she, “ I will get you

, to run over to Squire Baker’s, and_ say that I shall not be

able to ﬁnish his shirts to—night, but I will try to send them
over in the morning before he goes.”

4. “ You don’t feel well mother, do you? ”

“ N o, I have a bad headache. I think I shall go to bed
early, and see if I can’t sleep it off.”

“ I don’t believe it agrees with you to sew so much,” said
Johnny. ‘ '

“ I sometimes wish I. had a sewing-machine,” said his
mother. “ That would enable me to do three times as much
work with less fatigue.”

5. “ How much does a sewing—machine cost?”

“ I suppose a good one would cost not far from a hundred
dollars.”

“ A hundred dollars ! That is a good deal of money,” said ‘

Johnny.

“ Yes, quite too much for our means. Of course there is _

no chance of my being able to purchase one.”

6. As Johnny went across the ﬁeld to Squire Baker’s, he
could not help thinking of what his mother had said. He
had hoped the cost of a machine would not exceed twenty
dollars, for in that case there might be some chance of his
earning the amount in time. Occasionally the neighbors

THE FOURTH READER. 55

called upon him to do odd jobs, and paid him small sums.
These in time might. amount to twenty dollars. But a hun-
dred seemed quite too large for ‘him to think of accumu-
lating. .

7. “ Still,” thought Johnny, “ I’ve a good mind to try. I
won’t wait for jobs to come to me 3 I’ll look out for them.
I have a good deal of time out of school when I might be
doing something. If I don’t get enough to buy a sewing-
machine, I may get something else that mother will like.”

8. The next day was Saturday, and school did not keep.
It was about the first of October. In the town where Johnny
lived there were many swamps planted with cranberries,
which were now ripe and ready for gathering. It was nec-
essary to pick them before a frost, since this fruit, if touch-
ed with the frost, will decay rapidly. As Johnny was coming
home from the store, he met a school companion, who seem-
ed to be in a hurry.

r 9. “ Where are you going, Frank?” he inquired.

“ I’m going to pick cranberries for Squire Baker.”

“ How much does he pay?” I

“ Two cents a quart.”

“ Do you think he would hire me?” asked Johnny, with a
sudden thought. ,

“Yes, and be glad to get you. He’s got a good many
cranberries on the vines, and he’s afraid there will be a frost
to-night.” .

“ Then I’ll ask mother if I can go. Just hold on a
minute.”

“ All right.” .

10. Having obtained permission, Johnny rejoined his
companion, and proceeded at once to the swamp. The
fruit was abundant; for the crop this year was unusually
good, and Johnny found that he could pick quite rapidly.
When noon came, he found that he had picked twenty

~ quarts.

“ Can you come again this afternoon? ” asked the squire.

‘‘ Yes, sir,” said Johnny promptly.

“ I shall‘ be very glad to have you, for hands are scarce.”

11. Johnny had already earned forty cents, and hoped to
earn as much more in the afternoon. He was so excited by

his success that he hurried through his dinner with great
rapidity, and was off once more to the swamps. He worked
till late, and found at the end of the day that he had gathered
ﬁfty quarts. He felt veryrich when the squire handed him a
one-dollar greenback in return for his services. He felt
pretty tired in consequence of stooping ‘so much, but the
thought that he had earned a whole dollar in one day fully
‘repaid him.

12. “Mother,” said Johnny, when he got home, “if you ~

are willing, I will keep this money. There is something very
particular I want it for.”

“ Certainly,” said his mother. “ You shall keep this, and
all you earn. I am very sure you will not wish to spend it
unwisely.” e

“ N 0, mother, you may be sure of that.”

13. On Monday it so happened that the teacher was sick,
and school was suspended. Johnny found no difficulty in
obtaining a chance to pick cranberries for another neighbor.
He was determined to do a little better than on Saturday.
When evening came, he was paid for ﬁfty-three quarts,---one
dollar and six cents.

“ I wish there were cranberries to be picked all the year
round,” thought Johnny. “ I should soon get a hundred
dollars.”

14. But this was about the last of his picking. School
kept the next day, and though he got a little time after school,
he could only pick a few quarts. When the cranberry season
was over, Johnny found himself the possessor of four dollars.
After that his gains were small. Occasionally he ran on an
errand for a neighbor. Once he turned the grindstone for
about half an hour, and received the small compensation of
one cent from a rather parsimonious farmer. Johnny was
about to throw it away, when the thought came to him, that,
small as it was,'it would help a little.

15. So the autumn slipped away, and winter came and
went. In the spring Johnny found more to do. -On the
ﬁrst day of June he counted his money and found he had
ﬁfteen dollars.

“ It’ll take a long time to get a hundred dollars,”fsighed
Johnny. “ If mother would only let me go to work in a

shoe—shop ? But she thinks I had better go to school. But
by and by there’ll be a chance to pick cranberries again. I
wish there’d be a vacation then.”

REMARKS AND QUEsTIoNs.———“ The Great Rebellion” was
a war set on foot for the purpose of destroying the govern-
ment of the United States. It began in the month of April,
1861. The battle of Fredericksburg was fought in the month
of December, 1862. In this battle General Burnside com-
manded the Union army and General Lee the army of the
rebels. The Union men fought bravely, but a great many
were killed.

It is only a few years since the ﬁrst sewing-machine was
ever used. The ﬁrst machine was very rude and clumsy, but

different men invented new contrivances, one after another, I

which improved it, until now there are many kinds of excel-
lent sewing-machines. Every man who invents a labor-
saving machine does a great deal of good, for he enables
working-people to give more time to study and the cultivation
of their minds. ,

What is it to enlist? Is it right for a man to leave his
wife and children and go to war? What is meant by a “ dis-
astrous battle”? Why had Mrs. Cooper “little time to
mourn”? What is a “pension”? What is “rent”? Why
was not ]ohnny’s mother willing that he should work in the

time? Is the “ sewing-machine ” auseful thing? Why? To
whom is it useful? Have people always had sewing—machines ?
Do you think it was easy to make the ﬁrst sewing—machine?
What kind of fruit are “ cranberries ” ? In what kind of ground

' do they grow ? What is meant by being “touched with the

frost”? For what are cranberries used? How do the
“ vines ” grow, and what is their appearance ? Do you think
Johnny was very industrious to pick twenty quarts in half a
day? Why did he wish to keep the dollar? How long was
he earning ﬁfteen dollars? How long is it from cranberry
time until June ? Is one cent good wages for turning grind-

XII.—THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.

1. One morning Johnny had occasion to cross the fields
near a small pond about half a mile from his mother’s house.
He was busily thinking about his ‘little fund, and what he could
do to increase it, when his attention was all at once attracted

by a sharp cry of distress. Looking up, he saw a gentleman ‘

in a row-boat on the pond, who appeared to be in the great-
est trouble.

“ Boy,” he called out, “ can you swim? ”

“ Yes, sir,” said Johnny.

“ Then save my little daughter, if you can. She has just
fallen out of the boat. There_ she is.”

2. The little girl just appeared above the surface of the
water. Luckily it was very near the shore, yet too deep for
any one to venture who was unable to swim. Our young
hero had plenty of courage. Moreover, he was an expert
swimmer, having been taught by his father before he went to
the‘war. Without a minute’s hesitation he stripped off his
jacket and plunged in. A few vigorous strokes brought him
to the little girl. He seized her, just as she was about sink-
ing for the third time. He held her till her father could re-
ceive her from his arms into the boat.

3. “ Let me lift you in, too,” he said.

“ N o, sir, I’ll swim to shore,” said Johnny.

“ Come up to the hotel this afternoon. I want to see
you.”

The father applied" himself to the restoration of his
daughter, and Johnny went home and changed his wet
clothes. He had recognized the gentleman as a merchant
from the city who had been boarding at the hotel for a week
or two. He felt a glow of satisfaction in the thought that he
had been instrumental in saving a human life; for it was
very evident that, her father being unable to swim, the little
girl would, but for him, have been drowned.

4. In the afternoon he went to the hotel, and inquired .

for Mr. Barclay, for he had heard the gentleman’s name.
He was conducted upstairs into a private parlor.

THE FOURTH READER. 59

Mr. Barclay advanced towards him with a smile of wel-
come. “ I am glad to see you, my brave boy,” he said.

“ Is your little girl quite recovered?” asked Johnny,
modestly. J E —  

5. “Yes, nearly so. I-thought it best to let her lie in
bed the remainder of the day, as she might have got chilled.
And now, my dear boy, how shall I expressi my gratitude to
you for your noble conduct? Under God, you have been
the means of saving my dear chi/l,.d”s life. I am quite unable
to swim, and I shudder to thin‘l«{ what would have happened
but for your timely presence and courage.” ~

6. “I am very glad I was able to be of service,” said
Johnny.

“ I can not allow such a service to go unrewarded,” said
Mr. Barclay. “ Adequate compensation I can not offer, for
money will not pay for the saving of life ,- but you will allow
me to give you this as a first instalment of my gratitude.”
He pressed into the hands of the astonished boy a one-hun-
dred-dollar bill.

'7. “ One hundred dollars I ” exclaimed Johnny in be-
wilderment. “ Do you really mean to give me so much ? ’i

“ It is little enough, I am sure.”

“O, I am so glad!” said Johnny, delighted. “Now I
can buy mother a sewing—machine.”

“ But don’t you want to buy something for yourself?”
asked Mr. Barclay, with interest.

“ No, sir , I would rather have a sewing—machine than
any thing.” .

8. Then Johnny, encouraged by Mr. Barclay’s evident

I interest, proceeded to tell him how for nearly a year he had
been saving up money, without his mother’s knowledge, to

buy her a machine, in order that she need not work so hard
in future. But thus far he had only succeeded in saving up
ﬁfteen dollars. Now, thanks to this unexpected gift, he would
be able to buy it at once. “And it will come just right,
too,” he said, with sparkling eyes; “ for it will be mother’s
birthday in a week from to-day, and I can give it to her

-then. Only,” he said, doubtfully, “I don’t know whom .1

can get to buy it.”

9. “ I canlhelpvyou there,” said Mr. Barclay. “I am go-

ing to the city in a day or two. I will select the machine,
and arrange to have it sent down by express on your mother’s
birthday.” ,

“ That’ll be just the thing,” said Johnny. “ Won’t she be
astonished! I shan’t say any thing to her about it before-
hand. Here’s the money, sir ,- I thank you very much for
that, and for your kind offer.”

“ I ought to be kind to you, my dear boy, when I think
how much you have done for me.”

“ Good afternoon, sir.”

“ Good afternoon. Call again to-morrow, and you shall
see the little girl you have saved.”

10. Johnny did call the next day, and made acquaintance
with little Annie Barclay, whom he found a sprightly little

, girl of four years of age. She took quite a fancy to our

young hero, with whom she had a ﬁne game of romps.
Mrs. Cooper knew‘ that Johnny had saved a little girl
from drowning, but never inquired what reward he had re-'

_ ceived, feeling sure that he would tell her sometime. I As for

Johnny, he had his reasons for keeping silent, as we know.

. 11. At length Mrs. Cooper’s birthday came. Johnny
was full of impatience for evening, for then the express
wagon would arrive from Boston, with the present for his
mother. As soon as he heard the rumble of the wheels, he
ran to the door. To his delight, the wagon stopped at the
gate.

“ Come here, youngster, and give us a lift,” called the
express—man. “ I’ve got something heavy for you.” 

12. It was a large article, looking something like a table;
but what it was Mrs. Cooper could not tell, on account of its
many wrappings. “ There must be some mistake,” she said,
going to the door. “ I am not expecting any thing.”

“ No, there isn’t,” said Johnny, “ it’s all right, directed in
large letters to Mrs. Mary Cooper, Benton.”

“ I shall want ﬁfty cents,” said the express-man. ,

“ I’ve got it here,” said Johnny, seeing that his mother
was searching for her pocketbook.

13. “ O,“ by the way, here’s something else,——a letter
directed to you. That will be ﬁfteen cents more.”

“ Indeed!” said Johnny, surprised. “Well, here’s the

money.” He took the letter, but did not open it at once.
He Wanted to enjoy his mother’s surprise.

Mrs. Cooper was unwrapping the machine. “What is
this?” she exclaimed in delighted surprise. “A sewing-
machine ! Who could have sent it? Do you know any thing
about it, Johnny ? ”

14. “Yes, mother. It’s a birthday present for you from

“ My dear boy ! How could you ever have earned money
enough to pay for it? ”

Then Johnny told his mother all about it. And her eyes
glistened with pride and joy as she heard, for the ﬁrst time,
how he had worked for months with this end in View 3 and
she could not help giving him a grateful kiss, which I am
sure paid Johnny for all he had done.

5. It was really a beautiful machine, and, though Johnny

62 ANALYTICAL SERIES»

did not know it, cost considerably more than the hundred
dollars he had sent. Mrs. Cooper found that it worked ad-
mirably, and would lighten her labors more even than she
had hoped.

“But you haven’t opened your letter,” she said, with a
sudden recollection.

“ So I haven’t,” said Johnny.

What was his surprise, on opening it, to discover the same

hundred-dollar bill which Mr. Barclay had originally given

him, accompanied by the following note :

16. “My Dear Young Friend :——I have bought your
mother a sewing—machine, which I send by express to-day.
I hope it will please you both, and prove very useful. I also
send you a hundred dollars, which I wish you to use for
yourself. The sewing-machine will be none the less your
present to your mother, since both that and the money are
a very insufﬁcient recompense for the service you have
rendered me. Continue to love and help your mother,
and when you are old enough to go into a store I will receive
you into mine.

“Your friend,
“ HENRY BARCLAY.”

17. There was greatjoy in the little cottage that evening.
Johnny felt as rich as a millionaire, and could not take his
eyes from the corner where the handsome new sewing-
machine had been placed. And his mother, happy as she
was in her present, was happier in the thought that it had
come to her through the good conduct of her son.

Johnny possessed, and tell what makes you think they be-

XIII.-ﬂ—THE BAREFOOT BOY.
JOHN G. WHITTIER.

1. Blessings on thee, little man,
Barefoot boy, with cheek of tan 1
With thy turned-up pantaloons,
And thy merry whistled tunes 3
With thy red lip, redder still
Kissed by strawberries on the hill 3
With the sunshine on thy face,
Through thy torn brim’s jaunty grace:
From my heart I give thee joy 3
I was once a barefoot boy!

Prince thou art—the grown-up man
Only is republican.

Let the million—dollared ride—
Barefoot, trudging at his side,
Thou hast more than he can buy,
In the reach of ear and eye,-
Outward sunshine, inward joy :
Blessings on thee, barefoot boy!

2. O, for boyhood’s painless play 3

Sleep that wakes in laughing day 3
Health that mocks the doctor’s rules 3
Knowledge (never learned of schools)
Of the wild bee’s morning chase,

Of the wild ﬂower’s time and place,
Flight of fowl, and habitude

Of the tenants of the wood 3

How‘ the tortoise bears his shell,
How the woodchuck digs his cell,
And the groundmole sinks his well 3
How the robin feeds her young,

How the oriole’s nest is hung 3

Where the freshest berries grow,
Where the ground—nut trails its Vine,

Of gray hornet artisans !—

For, eschewing books and tasks,
Nature answers all he asks ,'

Hand in hand with her he walks,
Face to face with her he talks,

Part and parcel of her joy,——
Blessings on the barefoot boy!

Crowding years in one brief moon,
When all things I heard or saw,
Me, their master, waited for 3--

I was rich in ﬂowers and trees,
Humming-birds and honey-bees ;
For my sport the squirrel played,
Plied the -snouted mole his spade ;
For my taste the blackberry cone
Purpled over hedge and stone ;
Laughed the brook for my delight
Through the day, and through the night,
Whispering at the garden wall,
Talked with me from fall to fall ,'
Mine the sancl—rimmed pickerel pond,
Mine the walnut slopes beyond,
Mine on bending orchard trees
Apples of Hesperides !

Still as my horizon grew,

Larger grew my riches, too ;

All the world I saw or knew
Seemed a complex Chinese toy,
Fashioned for a barefoot boy !

Like my bowl of milk and- bread,—-

Though the ﬂinty slopes be hard,

Every morn shall lead thee through
Fresh baptisms of the dew 3

Every evening from thy feet

Shall the cool wind kiss the heat ;
All too soon these feet must hide
In the prison-cells of pride,

Like a colt’s for work be shod,
Made to tread the mills of toil

Up and down in ceaseless moil 5

Never on forbidden ground,—-

Quick and treacherous sands of sin.

Ere it passes, barefoot boy!

XIV.—THE DAISY’S FIRST WINTER.
HARRIET B. STOWE.

1. Somewhere in'a garden of this earth, which the deal

 Lord has planted with many ﬂowers of gladness, grew a fresh,

bright little daisy. The ﬁrst this little daisy knew, she found

. herself growing in green pastures and beside the still waters

where the Heavenly Shepherd was leading his sheep. And
very beautiful did life look to her, as her bright little eyes,
with their crimson lashes, opened and looked down into the
deep crystal waters of the brook below, where the sunshine
made every hour more sparkles, more rings of light, and
more brilliant glances and changes of color, than all the jew-
elers in the world could imitate.

2. She knew intimately all the yellow—birds,‘and meadow-
larks, and bobolinks, and black—birds, that sang, piped, whis-
tled, or chattered among the bushes and trees in the pas-
tures, and she was a prime favorite with them all. The ﬁsh
that darted to and fro in the waters seemed like so many liv-
ing gems, and their silent motions, as they glided hither and
thither, were full of beauty, and told as plainly of happiness
as if they could speak. Multitudes of beautiful ﬂowers grew
up inthe water, or on the moist edges of the brook.

3. There were green fresh arrow-heads, which in their
time gave forth their white blossoms with a little gold ball in
the center of each, and there were the pickerel—weed, with its

and the tall meadow-grass, with its graceful green tassels

4. In fact, there is scarcely any saying how many beautiv
ful blooming things grew and ﬂourished in that green pasture
where dear little Daisy was so happy as first to open her
bright eyes. They did not all blossom at once, but had their

graceful changes ; but there was always a pleasant ﬂutter of 

expectation among them,———either a sending forth of leaves, or
a making of buds, or a bursting out into blossoms ,° and when
the blossoms passed away, there was a thoughtful, careful
maturing of seeds, all packed away so snugly in their little
coffers and caskets of seed—pods, which were of every quaint
and dainty shape that ever could be fancied for a lady’s
jewel-box.

5. Overhead there grew a wide-spreading apple—tree,
which in the month of June became a gigantic bouquet, hold-
ing up to the sun a million silvery opening ﬂowers, and a
million pink—tipped buds 5 and the little winds would come
to play in its branches, and take the pink shells of the blos-
soms for their tiny air-boats, in which they would go ﬂoating
round among the ﬂowers, or sail on voyages of discovery
down the stream ,- and when the time of its blossom was
gone, the bountiful tree from year to year had matured fruits
of golden ripeness which cheered the hearts of men.

6. Little Daisy’s life was only one varied delight from day
to day. She had a hundred playmates among the light~
winged winds, that came to her every hour to tell her what
was going on all over the green pasture, and to bring her
sweet perfumed messages from the violets and anemones of
even the more distant regions.

7. There was not a ring of sunlight that danced in the
golden network at the bottom of the brook that did not bring

a thrill of gladness to her heart ; not atiny ﬁsh glided in

his crystal paths, or played and frolicked under the water-
lily shadows, that was not a well—known friend of hers, and
whose pleasures she did not share. At night she held c-on-

'ferences with the dew—drops that stepped about among the

ﬂowers in their bright pearl slippers, and washed their leaves
and faces before they went to rest. Nice little nurses and

dressing—maids these dews ! and they kept tender guard all

night over the ilowers, watching and blinking wakefully to see

that all was safe ; but when the sun arose, each of them I

spread a pair of little rainbow wings, and was gone.

8. To be sure, there were some reverses in her lot.
Sometimes a great surly, ill—looking cloud would appear in
the sky, like a cross schoolmaster, and sweep up all the sun-
beams, and call in a gruff voice to the little winds, her play-
fellows, to come away from their nonsense, and then he
would send a great strong wind down on them, all with a
frightful noise and roar, and sweep all the little ﬂowers ﬂat to
the earth ,- and there would be a great rush and pattering of
rain drops, and bellowing of thunders, and sharp forked
lightnings would quiver through the air as if the green pas-
tures certainly were to be torn to pieces ; but in about half
an hour it would be all over,——-—the sunbeams would all dance
out from their hiding—places, just as good as if nothing had
happened, and the little winds would come laughing back,
and each little’ ﬂower would lift itself up, and the winds would
help them to shake off the wet and plume themselves as
jauntily as if nothing had gone 2

9. Daisy had the greatest pride and joy in her own pink
blossoms, of which there seemed to be an inexhaustible
store, for, as fast as one dropped its leaves, another was
ready to open its eyes, and there were buds of every size,
waiting still to come on, even down to little green cushions of
buds that lay hidden away in the middle of the leaves down
close to the root. “ How favored I am 1” said Daisy, “ I never
stop blossoming. The anemones and the liverwort and the

p blood—root have their time, but then they stop and have only

leaves, while I go on blooming perpetually ,' how nice it is to
be made as I am !”

10. “ But you must remember,” said a great rough Bur-
dock to her,-—“ you must remember that your winter must
come at last, when all this ﬁne blossoming will have to be
done with.” . .

“What do you mean?” said Daisy, in a tone of pride,
eying her rough neighbor with a glance of disgust. “You
are a rough, ugly old thing, and that’s- why you are cross.
Pretty people like me can afford to be good-natured."

11. “ Ah, well,” said Dame Burdock, “ you’ll see. It’s a

pretty thing if a young chit just out from seed this year
should be impertinent to me, who have seen twenty winters,
-—yes, and been through them well, too ! ”

“ Tell me, Bobolink,” said Daisy, “is there any truth in
wl1at this horrid Burdock has been saying? What does she
mean by winter P ”

12. “ I don’t know,—not I,” said Bobolink, as he turned
a dozen somersets in the air, and then perched himself airily
on a thistle—head, singing,——

“ I don’t know, and I don’t care ;

It’s mighty pleasant to ﬂy up there,

And it’s mighty pleasant to light down here,
And all I know is chip, chip, cheer.”

13. “ Say, Humming-bird, do you know any thing about

  winter ? ” ’

“Winter! I never saw one,” said Humming-bird 3 ‘‘we
have wings, and follow summer round the world, and where
she is, there go we.”

“ Meadow-Lark, Meadow-Lark, have you ever heard of
winter? ” said Daisy.

14. Meadow-Lark was sure he never remembered one.
“ What is winter P ” he said, looking confused.

“Butterﬂy, Butterﬂy,” said Daisy, “come, tell me, will

' there be winter, and what is winter? ”

But the Butterﬂy laughed, and danced up and down, and
said, “What is Daisy talking about? I never heard of
winter! I Winter? ha! ha!. What is it?”

15. “Then it’s only one of Burdock’s spiteful sayings,” I

said Daisy. “Just because she isn’t pretty, she wants to
spoil my pleasure, too. Say, dear lovely tree that shades
me so sweetly, is there such a thing as winter’? ”

And the tree said, with a sigh through its leaves, “ Yes,
daughter, there will be winter; but fear not, for the Good
Shepherd makes both summer and winter, and each is good
in its time. - Enjoy the summer, and fear not.”

REMARKs.—The daisy is a beautiful little ﬂower, a native
of Europe. It belongs to what is called the Composite

order of plants, of  dandelion is an example. The

meaning of the word daisy is day’: eye. The plant is so
called on account of its great beauty of form and color. Let
the pupil study the descriptions with care, and learn the
beautiful lessons so admirably developed in the dialogue.
Such study will be very efficient in improving the moral
character as well as the taste of children.

XV.—THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.

1. The months rolled by. The violets had long ago
stopped blooming, their leaves were turning yellow, but they
had beautiful green seed-caskets, full of rows of little pearls,
which next year should come up in blue violets. The dog-
toothed Violet and the eye—bright had‘ gone under ground, so

that no more was seen of them, and Daisy wondered whither,

they could be gone. But she had new acquaintances, far
more brilliant, and she forgot the others. The brook-side
seemed all on -ﬁre with golden—rod, and the bright yellow
was relieved by the rich purple tints of the asters, while‘ the
b1ue—fringed gentian held up its cups, that seemed as if they
might have been cut out of the sky ,'—-and still Daisy had
abundance of leaves and blossoms, and felt strong and well

at the root. Then the apple-tree cast down to the ground‘

its fragrant burden of golden apples, and men came and
carried them away.
2. By and by there came keen, cutting winds, and driv-

. ing storms of sleet andahail ; and then at night it would be

so cold, so cold! and one after another the leaves and
ﬂowers fell stiff and frozen, and grew black, and turned to
decay. The leaves loosened and fell from the apple-tree,
and sailed away by thousands down the brook ; the butter”-

ﬂies lay dead with the ﬂowers, but all the birds had gone

singing away to the sunny south, following the summer into
other lands.
, 3. “ Tell me, dear tree,” said Daisy, “is this winter that
is coming? ”

“ It is winter, darling,” said the tree 3 “ but fear not. The
Good Shepherd makes winter as well as summer.”

72 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

“ I still hold my blossoms,” said Daisy, for Daisy was a
hardy little thing.

4. But the frosts came harder and harder every night,
and ﬁrst they froze her blossoms, and then they froze her
leaves, and ﬁnally all, all were gone,—there was nothing left
but the poor little root, with the folded leaves of the future
held in its bosom.

5. “Ah, dear tree! ” said Daisy, “is not this dreadful? ”

“ Be patient, darling,” said the tree. “ I have seen many,
many winters ,- but the Good Shepherd loses never a seed,  

never a root, never a ﬂower : they will all come again.”

6. By and by came colder days and colder, and the brook
froze to its little heart and stopped : and then there came
bitter, driving storms, and the snow lay wreathed over Daisy’s
head ; but still from the bare branches of the apple-tree came
a voice of cheer. “ Courage, darling, and patience 1. Not a
ﬂower shall be lost : winter is only for a season.”

“ It is so dreary ! ” murmured Daisy, deep in her bosom.

“ It will be short: the spring will come again,” said the
tree.  

7. And at last spring did come ; and the snow melted

' and ran away down the brook, and the sun shone out warm,

and fresh green leaves jumped and sprang out of every dry
twig of the apple-tree. And one bright, rejoicing day, little
Daisy opened her eyes, and lo! there were all her friends
once more ;—-there were the eye—brights and the violets and
the anemones and the liverwort,—-—only ever so many more
of them than there were last year, because each little pearl
of a seed had been nursed and moistened by the snows of
winter, and had come up as a little plant to have its own
ﬂowers. The birds all came back, and began building their
nests, and every thing was brighter and fairer than before ;
and Daisy felt strong at heart, because she had been through
a winter, and learned not to fear it. She looked up into the
apple—tree. “Will there be more winters, dear tree?” she
said.

8. “ Darling, there will ; but fear not. Enjoy the present
hour, and leave future winters to Him who makes them.
Thou hast come through these sad hours, because the Shep-
herd remembered thee. He loseth never a ﬂower out of his

THE FOURTH READER. 73

pasture, but calleth them all by name: and the snow will
never drive so cold, nor the wind beat so hard, as to hurt one
of his ﬂowers. And look! of all the ﬂowers of last year,
what one is melted away in the snow, or forgotten in the

, number of green things? Every blade of grass is counted,

and puts up its little head in the right time 3 so never fear,
Daisy, for thou shalt blossom stronger and brighter for the
winter.”

9. “ But why must there be winter? ” said Daisy.

“I never ask why,” said the tree. “ My business is to
blossom and bear apples. Summer comes, and I am joyful 3
winter comes, and I am patient. But, darling, there is
another garden where thou and I shall be transplanted one
day, where there shall be winter no more. There is coming

a new earth ; and not one ﬂower or leaf of these green pas-’

tures shall be wanting there, but come as surely as last year’s
ﬂowers come back this spring ! ”

REMARKS AND QUEsTIoNs.——The two selections ending
here contain what is called an allegory. Trees, ﬂowers,
birds, insects, &c., are represented as doing and saying cer-
tain things, and as passing through certain experiences. But
the things really sought to be expressed are human thoughts
and experiences, which are similar to those attributed to the
objects of nature.

What does the summer in the allegory represent? What
does the winter represent? What kind of people does the
daisy represent? the apple—tree ? the burdock? the bobolink?
the humming-bird? the butterﬂy? Who is the Good Shep-

herd? What is the garden where there is to be no winter?

Even the hearts in our bosoms
Are leaping to greet her again!

XVII.-—SUSY’S DRAGON.

NORA PERRY.

1. It was after school, and Susy sat in one of the great
windows of the library, writing out her French exercises. It
was evidently dull work for her, for she yawned and ﬁdgeted
and sighed in a very restless manner ,- and every now and

A then she would stop in the midst of a line, and watch the

boys playing at marbles on the sidewalk. There was little
Kit and Jimmy Grant ; what good times they did have ! O
dear ! she wished she were a boy, and were playing marbles
on the sidewalk, instead of toiling at these tiresome French
exercises. Nobody had to study as hard as she did, she was
sure. There was Tom, now, ﬂying his kite an hour ago;
and there—yes, there was Fanny Hamlin going after trailing
arbutus, as true as the world ! This was too great a tempta-
tion. Down went the exercises, and up went the window, in
a breath. “ O F anny! Fanny! are you going after trailing
arbutus ? ”

2'. Yes, Fanny was going after trailing arbutus, and she

wished Susy would come with her. Why couldn’t she? Susy
asked herself the Very question, and came to the conclusion
that there was really no sufﬁcient reason why she couldn’t.
“ Because I can write the rest of my exercises out to—morrow
morning,” she thought.

3. “ I’m just going for a walk to Pine-woods,” she said to
Aunt Cathy, who had the charge of Susy and her brothers
since their mother’s death. a

Aunt Cathy lifted her kind but penetrating gaze to Susy’s
face, and Susy felt uncomfortable, though all her aunt said

in reply was, “ Very well, my clear 3 you know best whether

you can spare the time.”

THE FOURTH READER. 77

4. This was always Aunt Cathy’s way. She said a sensi-
ble girl of thirteen, like Susy, should be taught to depend on
her own judgment in matters of this kind. Susy was the one
who went to school ; Susy was the one who had lessons to
learn ;—then Susy was the only one who could tell when

‘these school duties were over, and whether her lessons were

learned. And if Susy wasn’t faithful to her duty, then she

- must suffer the penalty. She was a baby no longer, to be

governed _blindly ,- she must learn to govern herself ,- it would
teach her to know herself a great deal better, and to be self-
reliant. ‘ A

5. Susy liked Aunt Cathy’s “way,” but she always knew
when Aunt Cathy thought she had neglected any thing, and
it always made her feel very uneasy, as people do when they
abuse the trust reposed in them. And now this lovely spring
afternoon, searching for arbutus with Fanny Hamlin, there
was this shadow of uneasiness, of something unfulﬁlled,
which clouded the bright day, and made the pleasure half a
pain. But they were very successful in their hunt for ﬂowers.
Susy had never carried home such a big basketful, and dear,

_. kind Aunt Cathy admired them to her heart’s content.

6. “ But you look tired, Susy,” she said to her.

“Yes, we went farther than we meant to at the start;
why, we went almost to Long—Roads, Aunt Cathy.”

“ Which is almost three miles. I should think you’d be
tired, Susy. Now I should advise you, my dear, to eat your
supper at once and go to bed.”

7. And Susy was sensible enough to take this advice, for
she remembered what she had to do in the morning: and if
she would oversleep the time !

y “ Will you call me when you get up, Bridget?” she asked if

of the cook, when she went up stairs.
“ Shure, it’s not at ﬁve o’clock you’d be wanting to rise?”
exclaimed Bridget, in astonishment.
, “ But I do, Bridget ; and I want you to call me.”
a 8. “O well, I can do that aisy, Miss ; but it’ll not be so aisy

for you to mind it,” Bridget replied in her dry way ; “for

Shure,” she said to Katy Malony, the chambermaid, “ haven’t
I tried her at this calling before, and didn’t she always fail at
the minding! ”

It didn’t seem more than an hour to Susy when she heard
Bridget calling at the door, “ Come, Miss Susy, it’s ﬁve
o’clock, and you rernifhber you wanted me to call yer.”

9. “ Yes, Bridpl /hear,” she answered, “ and I’m going
to get right up,” wiih she certainly meant to do. But it was

 

so early, so long bfore nine o’clock, she would lie just a,

minute: and that was the last she remembered until a great
thumping at her door broke into a morning dream.

aglt was her brother Tom. “Come, Sue,” he shouted,

“ aren’t you ever going to get up ?- It’s bre;akfast—time, and

Bridget says she woke you hours ago. Come, hurry up ! I

want you to see me ﬂy my new kite. I bought?‘ it of Sam

suchii‘a=.girl in my life as you are, Sue. You’re always in a
hurry, and you never get out of it.”

There was no time given her to reply to this assertion, for
Tom hadbanged the door,‘ and was halfway down the avelnue
in a minute. Then what could she have replied? When the
truth is told us, however unpleasantly, what is there for us to
say? ’    I
12. But the fact was, at present Susy didn’t think much
about the sayz'7zg,- it was the dozﬂg that occupied her. Here
were two pages yet to translate 1 She set to work now in
good earnest, but, of necessity, it had to be very hurried
work ; and Susy was never a ready translator. She was al-
ways a little uncertain with those perplexing verbs and pro«-
nouns. There was one rule she had to repeat to herself over
and over again : “ 1% before the Verb, and pas after it.” She
had no time this morning to go back and correct mistakes,
however, for there rang the quarter bell, and she was only at
that moment at the foot of the page. _

13. “ Dear me,” she sighed ; “if I get another tardy mark,

or an imperfect one, Miss Hill will change my seat, I know.
Every thing has gone wrong this week. I suppose it’s what
Cousin Bella calls a Fate.”

Poor Susy ! she got both,-—the tardy mark and the im-
perfect one ; for that French lesson was an awful boggle.

“What does ail you, Susy?” said Miss Hill, as Made-
moiselle Le Brun reported her angrily.

14. “ She has de grand talent, but she is not attenteev ! ”
cried Mademoiselle, in her broken English, and her little
shrill, impatient Voice.

“ I am afraid that is it, Susy,” said Miss Hill, kindly.

Susy burst into tears. A dim consciousness was stealing
over her, that the “ every thing going wrong” wasn’t Fate ex-
actl .

>175. Her eyes were so red from these tears when she went
home that Aunt Cathy asked the same question Miss Hill
had asked, but with a different solicitude, “ What does ail
you, Susy?”

Then Susy told her troubles : how she had missed yester-
day in her geography, and to-day in her French 3 how she
had been marked tardy just for being a second behind the
last bell-ringing ; and then the dreaded result of all,——losing
her seat beside Fanny Hamlin.

16. Aunt Cathy heard her gently and patiently, but at the
end she did not say much 5 she felt sure that Susy was ﬁnding
out for herself the cause of these troubles, and she thought
this would be better for her in the end than to have her fault
held up before her by somebody else. That time, at least,
Susy was on her guard. She took her history lesson into a
little back room, where she could neither see the boys playing
at marbles, nor Tom ﬂying his kite, nor Fanny ‘Hamlin if she
passed ; and then she put her mind upon her task, and was
astonished to ﬁnd that, by this steady, uninterrupted applica-
tion, she had accomplished in an hour what she had many a
time spent three hours over.

17. When she went down stairs, Tom was crossing the

, hall whistling one of his favorite negro melodies; and, re- 4,

membering her ungraciousness of the morning, she said to
him, “ I want to see your new kite, Tom.”
“ O, you’re over your hurry, are you? Well, the new kite’s

and away he went towards the parlor, looking rather “ huffy "
and injured still.

18. Susy followed him, and found Aunt Cathy reading
aloud to little Kit. It was a ‘pleasant story, and Aunt Cathy
was a pleasant reader ,- and after the reading, which both
Susy and Tom had enjoyed as much as little Kit, they all

Susy came across a picture of St. George and the Dragon.

19. “ St. George? 0, he was a saint or hero, whose story
belongs to the age of the crusades. The crusaders, you know,
were those who fought in what are called ‘ The Holy Wars,’
for the conquest of Palestine. Palestine, you see, was in
the hands of unbelievers, and the Christians were horriﬁed
that the land where Jesus had lived and taught and died,

should be in such possession 3 so for years they disputed this
possession by ﬁghting these battles.

20. “ The legend of St. George is, that he was a re-
nowned prince, whose greatest achievement was the ‘slaying
of an enormous dragon, by which exploit he effected the de-
liverance from bondage of Aja, the daughter of a king. His
story and character were so popular with the ancient Chris-
tians, that they bore the representation of the knight upon
their standards. And at this day the badge of the famous
Order of the Knights of the Garter, in England, is the image
of St. George. '

21. “ To every one now it is a symbol of victory of some
kind,——the victory gained over any weakness or sin ,- for we
all of us have some weakness or sin which is a dragon. for us
to ﬁght. Thackeray, the great novelist, whom your father
admires so much, said he had not one dragon, but two, and
that they were Indolence and Luxury; and he said it in con-
nection with this picture of St. George, which had just been
given him, and which he declared he should hang at the head
of his bed, where he could see it every morning.”

22. As Aunt Cathy concluded, Susy’s face grew very
grave and earnest, and, bending over the picture of St.
George, she looked at it a long time in silence 5 but it was
not until she was alone with Aunt Cathy that she spoke what

was in her mind.

T 23. The boys had both gone to bed,'and she still held the
picture before her, regarding it with great interest, when she
said: “Aunt Cathy, I’ve found out my dragon. It is that
long word beginning with P, that little Kit was trying to spell
the other day ; and it means, to keep putting every thing off

’ till another time, that ought to be done right away.”

“ I know. Procrastination,——that is the word, Susy.”

24. “ Yes, that is it ; that is my dragon, and it’s been the
cause of all my troubles, Aunt Cathy. Now I’ll tell you
what I’m going to do. I’m going to ask father if he will let
me have this picture cut out and framed, and I’ll hang it at

A the fdot of my bed, and try to remember, when I look at it,

that I’ve got a battle to ﬁght every day; for I have, Aunt
Cathy.

ment she burst out bravely, in a determined voice: “But I
shall try real hard to beat Mm, any way! ”

27. “ That’s ‘it, Susy! ” Aunt Cathy exclaimed. “Try
real hard ; it’s all any body can do 5 and in trying I know you
will win the battle, my dear.”

And Susy was true to her word. She did try “real hard,”
and at last she won the battle.

XX.—THE ENGLISH REDBREAST AND THE
AMERICAN ROBIN.

OUR YOUNG FOLKS.

America, they brought with them the old as§ociE3ffions and
recollections of the home theywere leaving. Unwilling to
part at once with these old and dear as ps,;$l1ey sought

poisonous species of sumac which is here called by that
name. Our New England dogwood is also a ‘sumac, and not
a true dogwood. Our woodbine is not the same vine meant
in English books by that name; and the Robin of North
America is totally unlike the dear old Robin Redbreast,
whose benevolent attentions to the unfortunate Babes in the
Wood have invested the name of Robin with the affectionate
associations of childhood, wherever the English language is
spoken.

3. The Robin Redbreast more nearly resembles our com-
mon Bluebird than any other of our native birds, although
the latter is somewhat larger. The Redbreast of Europe is
quite a small bird, being only about ﬁve inches and three
quarters from the tip of its bill to the end of its tail—feathers.
The principal color of this bird is a yellowish, olive—brown.
The throat and breast are of a reddish--orange color, and this
gives to them their name of R€dbI€%iE,T~f; V

4. They are very common in Europe, and especially so in
England. They remain all the year round, and appear to be
even more numerous in winter than in summer. This may
be partly owing to their deserting the frozen ﬁelds and snow-
covered gardens, where they can no longer obtain food, and
resorting to the habitations of man. I

5. In the summer-time they feed iipi..,   ;.;..;.i. i.ieri'i::s.
In the winter every rural dwelling is resorted to by these
charming little birds, who seldom fail ‘to meet with a coi-'-eli-al
welcome from the young folks of Old England. Where they
are well treated they soon become very familiar and make

themselves quite at liome,‘entering the cottage doors, picking E

up the crumbs thrown to them, and often roosting contented-

A ly over night in their warm and hospitable kitchens. .

6. The poet Thomson thus describes the manner in
which little Robin Redbreast enters a cottage to pick up the
needed food :  

“ The Redbreast, sacred to the household gods,
Wisely regardful of the embroiling sky,
In joyless ﬁelds and thorny thickets leaves
His shivering mates, and pays to trusted man
His annual visit. Half afraid, he ﬁrst
Against the window beats ; then, brisk, alights

On the warm hearth ; then, hopping o’er the ﬂoor,
Eyes all the smiling family askance,

And pecks, and starts, and Wonders where he is ;
Till," more familiar grown, the table-crumbs
Attract his slender feet.”

7. Mr. Yarrell, the English naturalist, tells us that ties
Redbreast has a s_prightly air, a full, dark eye, which, with
the sidelong turn of its head which it puts on when thus ap-«
pealing for human aid, gives an appearance of Sagacity and
inquiry to its character. This, aided by its trusted‘ enti-
dence, gains it friends every where, and the Robin has accord-
ingly become afamiliar domestic pet in almost every country
of Europe. E A

8. The Redbreast has a sweet and plaintive, but not a
powerful song, which it keeps up, like our own Bluebird———
which in this respect also it most resembles——from early
spring to late in autumn. It builds a very pretty and neatly
constructed nest of mosses, dried leaves, and dead grasses,
lined with ﬁne hair and soft feathers. These are placed near the
ground, in thick bushes, or in holes in walls, among branches
of ivy. English books of natural history are full of interest-
ing narratives of the beautiful confidence in man shown by
the Redbreast in selecting a place for its nest.

9._ One pair selected a small cottage adjoining a large
blacksmith’s shop, where, throughout the day, a constant
noise was made by the forge. They entered through an
open window, and built their nest in a child’s covered cart,
hanging on a peg over the ﬁreplace. Here the pair built
their ﬁrst nest early in spring. Although they were atten-
tively watched by crowds of curious spectators, they raised
their brood, and, as soon as these could ﬂy, built a second

nest on a shelf on the opposite side of the room. Here, too,  

they raised successfully a second brood ; and as soon as
these could take care of themselves, the same pair built a
third nest in a different part of the room, on a bundle of
papers on a shelf, and there, late in June, the pair were seen
feeding their four ﬂedglings, unmindful of a roomful of
featherless bipeds looking curiously on.

10. Another pair of Redbreasts chose fortheir nest a

T shelf in a school-room, in which there were some seventy

children at school, and directly over the heads of a little
class of girls, who never once disturbed them. There they
hatched out ﬁve eggs. One of their little birds died, and
the parents carried out its dead body-during school hours.
The other four little Robins were fed and reared, day by day,
in the presence of the seventy children. Do you wonder
that the young folks of England are so fond of their conﬁd-
ing Robin Redbreast?

11. But we will tell you one more anecdote, still more
interesting. , In one of the churches of Old England the
Bible had been left on the sacred desk lying open, with one
part resting on a raised ledge, leaving ahollow place between
it and the cushion. There a pair of Robins, before the fol‘
lowing Sunday, built -their nest and deposited their eggs.
The next Sunday, during divine service, there the mother-bird
boldly sat, undisturbed either by the music of the choir, the
reading of the services, or the responses of the congregation.
On the following Sunday there were ﬁve little Robins in the
nest 3 and all through the morning and evening services the
parent birds were flying in and out, bringing food to their little
ones, unmindful of the congregation over whose heads they
passed and repassed in the discharge of their parental duties.

12. Such is the Robin Redbreast of Europe. We have
no bird in this part of America which quite equals - it in its
conﬁding trust and its sociable and affectionate familiarity.
Our Robin, so called from some, fancied resemblance in its
colors, is a very different bird in all respects.

 

XXI.-—-—THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.

1. The Robin of North America belongs to a very differ-
ent family,—that of the Thrushes. It is of nearly twice the
length of the Redbreast, and more than twice its size. Hav-
ing been so fortunate as to receive the name by which it is
now generally known, and having some good qualities of its

‘ own, the American Robin‘ is quite as much of a favorite as
it deserves to be,——more so than a good many other birds far *

more worthy of our favor.‘
2. Our Robin is probably one of the most common birds

90 ANALYTICAL SERIES.

all over North America. In summer it is found as far to the
north as the Arctic seas, from the Atlantic to the Paciﬁc
oceans ,- and in winter it is found in all the Southern States
and in Mexico. It is called the Migratory Thrush by Audu-
bon, because it leaves us when winter comes on, and does
not return until the frost is out of the ground. It does this
probably because its food fails it in winter,-—not because of
the cold. In the thick woods in the valleys of the White

Mountains, where berries are plentiful all the year round, the ‘

Robin stays through all the very severe winters.

3. The American Robin possesses some traits of char-
acter not altogether to be commended. He is greedy, vo-
racious, and wasteful of the good things of our gardens. He
helps himself to our cherries. He eats more than he needs,
and wastes more than he eats. He plunders our strawberry-
beds, and there too he picks to pieces and destroys unneces-
sarily more than he eats.

4. So, too, the Robin appropriates our Currants, and, later
in the season, helps himself to ripe pears, if we leave them
to ripen within his reach ,- and he is also accused of helping
himself in the autumn to our grapes. The worst of it is that
he does not seem to know when he has had enough. Too
often will he eat more than is good for himself. In South

Carolina he will devour the berries of a tree called the Pride -

of India, in such large quantities as to disable himself from
ﬂying, and large numbers are taken and destroyed after they
have thus fed upon these berries, becoming an easy prey.

5. The Robin is also a quarrelsome fellow, and will some-
times drive away from the garden where it resorts other kinds
of unoffending birds which deserve better treatment. A pair
of Robins once undertook to prevent several families of
Swallows from returning to their own homes in a martin-box,
in order to feed their young. The Robins stood doggedly
before the entrance to the nest of the Swallows, and refused
to permit them to pass in. The poor Swallows, not strong
enough to ﬁght their own battles alone, told their grievances
to their neighbors, who came in large numbers and resolutely
attacked the Robins, but even they were not strong enough
to break the blockade until the owner of the garden appeared,
and raised the siege by driving the Robins away.

6. But these are the worst points in our Robin’s char-
acter. It has its good points too, and these are not few.
Its very greediness enables it to do a great deal of good. In
the spring of the year, when there are no berries for it to
feed upon, it destroys‘ a Vast number of injurious insects,
slugs, and Worms, which, but for the Robin, might destroy
whole crops.

7. Like the Robin of Europe, our bird also has a conﬁd-
ing disposition 3 though its conﬁdence has more of the bold-
ness of one who demands a right, than of the gentle trust
of one who seeks a favor. Early in spring, long before there
are any leaves to shelter or hide his nest, our Robin openly
constructs his large coarse nest of mud and hay, in places
more or less exposed. His very boldness assures his safety,
under the protection of man, from other enemies. He builds
his nest often in places singularly exposed to interruption
and observation. In one instance it was near a blacksmith’s
forge; in another, it was on the timbers of a half—ﬁnished
ship on the stocks, upon which the carpenters were still at
work. It is a very common thing to ﬁnd its nests on the
porches of houses, over window-sills, and in other places
which bring it into similar intimacy with man.

8. The Robin is a deservedly popular singer. Its notes
are said, by persons familiar with the far-famed Blackbird of
Europe, so greatly to resemble those of the latter bird as to
be hardly distinguishable. These are earnest, simple, and
thrilling ; and, being the ﬁrst to open and among the last to
close the great vernal concert of Nature, their notes are even
more esteemed than those of many of our superior songsters.

9. The parental devotion of our Robin is one of its best

‘traits. It is watchful, provident, and faithful to its young;

jealous of any approach to its nest, and evincing the great-
est anxiety at any appearance of danger. If its nest is ap-
proached too near, or its young molested, its cries of distress
and alarm are made almost articulate with reproaches and
remonstrances. ,

10. Our Robins, when taken sufficiently young, are easily

I tamed and reconciled to conﬁnement. They soon become

strongly attached to their benefactors where they are kindly
treated, and perfectly tame and familiar. In our younger

days, a pair of tame Robins made a part of our large family
They were allowed to come and go from their cage at pleas«
ure, and would follow our father, when permitted to do so,
wherever he went,-——ever on the watch for food from his
hands, or ready to see if he turned over the ground, that
they might search for worms.

11. They would come at his call, alight on his ﬁnger, or
head, or shoulder; and would resent, with an amazing air

of jealousy, any attempt of the smaller children to interfere *

with their privileges in theserespects. One of our pets, very
much to our sorrow, was accidentally killed, But our child-
ish grief, sincere as it was, did not equal the inconsolable
sorrow of its bereaved mate, which, refusing to be comforted,
resisted all attempts to induce it to take food, and in a few
days its loving spirit—-for who can doubt that it had one P-r.-
had left it to follow its loved and loving mate.

12. Such is our American Robin,——bearing little resem~
blance in size, shape, colors, or character, to its English
namesake, yet not wholly undeserving of our favorable re-

gard. We might all imitate with advantage its affectionate,-

loving disposition to its kindred and family; and esteem
ourselves fortunate if we can make ourselves so generally
welcome with our sweet and simple harmony as the Robin.
Its faults, we will remember, are but the promptings of its
natural instincts, planted there by a common Creator; and
we who are better taught have no excuse when we imitate

, them.

XXII.—MY BIRD’SN EST.

LUELLA CLARK.

1. I must tell you a little story

(True, every word),

How once, out of the southland early
Came a bird,

To a home in the midst of green grass
And high trees,

And the little birds never were frightened

« Out of these.

THE FOURTH READER. 

2. And this one went ﬂying, a week,

In and out

Of ﬁrst one tree, and then another,_
All about— 

As men hunt after homes for their children,
In a city-— .

Which too often they can not ﬁnd—-
More’s the pity;

But our bird could 5 for once on a time,
Like a bird,

On a blossoming branch we discovered
Bits of mud,

Which we knew for a brave beginning,
Then a straw ;—

8. And so, little by little, was builded,

Without ﬂaw,

A home ﬁt for a queen of birds.
But no queen

Was Shae, With her yellow-brown wings ;
You have seen

A hundred far fairer, I know,
Every year,

But never to me, was another
Half so dear ;

For she, ﬂying east, ﬂying west,
Had a song,—'—-

A song for her work and her rest,
All day long.

4. And full oft was her cheerful twitter
First to greet I
 ear, in the bright summer morning;
Low and sweet
Was always her song, and at night
I could hear
Her chirruping still, in the nest.
’Twas so near
I could reach with my hand the green leaves
sWhere it lay ;

94   . ANALYTICAL SERIES.

So, all summer, I wondered and watched,
Day by day,

The glad life that it held,—always glad,
Rain or shine.

That song never ceased : never sad,
Half divine '

Seemed sometimes the sweet voice to my soul,
Giving rest

And deep peace, strange gifts for a bird
On her nest.

' 5. But at last, the white night frosts of autumn
Chilled the air ,- ‘ T
. And one day the bird ﬂew away, singing,

Who knows where? »

And here, now, is the nest, on my table,
Miles away— i

A thousand—from where it was builded 3
And each day,

I look at its soft hair lining,
And I hear

The songs of those summer mornings,
Sweet and clear.

Hear them still, for a life that is glad,
Child’s or bird’s, V

Has an echo of song, far sweeter than
Any sweet words.

 

XXIII.—CHICKENS:

GAIL HAMILTON.

1. A chicken is beautiful and round and ful¥ of cunning

ways, but he has no resources for an emergency. He will ‘

lose his reckoning and be quite out at sea, though only ten

steps from home. He never knows enough to turn a corner.  

All his intelligence is like light, moving only in straight lines.
He is impetuous and timid, and has not the smallest presence
of mind or sagacity to discern between friend and foe. He
has no conﬁdence in any earthly power that does not reside

in an old hen. Her cluck will he follow to the last ditch, and
to nothing else will he give heed.

2. I am afraid that the Interpreter was putting almost too
ﬁne a point upon it, when he had Christiana and her children
“into another room, where was a hen and chickens, and bid
them observe awhile. So one of the chickens went to the
trough to drink, and every time she drank she lift up her head
and her eyes towards heaven. ‘ See,’ said he, ‘ what this
little chick doth, and learn of her to acknowledge whence
your mercies come, by receiving them with looking up.’ ”

3. Doubtless the chick lifts her eyes towards heaven, but a
close acquaintance with the race would put any thing but ac-
knowledgment in the act. A gratitude that thanks Heaven
for favors received, and then runs into a hole to prevent any

other person from sharing the beneﬁt of those favors, is a very

questionable kind of gratitude, and certainly should be con-
ﬁned to the bipeds that wear feathers.

 Yet, if you take away selﬁshness from a chicken’s
moral make-up, and fatuity from his intellectual, you have _a
very charming little creature left. For, apart from their ex-
cessive greed, chickens seem to be affectionate. They have
sweet social ways. They huddle together with fond caressing
chatter, and chirp soft lullabies. Their toilet performances
are full of interest. They trim each other’s bills with great

. thoroughness and dexterity, much better indeed than they

dress their own heads, for their bungling, awkward little claws
make sad work of it.

5. Igis as much as they can do to stand on two feet, and l

they natférally make several revolutions when they attempt to
stand on one. Nothing can be more ludicrous than their

» early efforts to walk. They do not really walk. They sight

their object, waver, balance, decide, and then tumble forward,
stopping all in aheap as soon as the original impetus is lost,-—
generally some way ahead of the place to which they wished
to go.

6. It is delightful to watch them as drowsiness ﬁlms their
round, bright, black eyes, and the dear old mother croons

‘ them under her ample wings, and they nestle in perfect har-
mony. How they manage to bestow themselves with such.

room so close, it is diﬁicult to imagine. They certainly deal
a staggering blow to our preconceived notions of the neces-
sity of oxygen and ventilation, but they make it easy to see
whence the Germans derived their fashion of sleeping under
feather beds. But breathe and bestow themselves they do.
The deep mother-heart and the broad mother-wings take them
all in.

7. They penetrate her feathers, and open for themselves
unseen little doors into the mysterious, brooding, beckoning

darkness. But it is long before they can arrange themselves ‘

satisfactorily. They chirp, and stir, and snuggle, trying to
ﬁnd the warmest and softest nook. Now an uneasy head is
thrust out, and now a whole tiny body, but it soon re-enters
in another quarter, and at length the stir and chirr grow still.
You see only a collection of little legs, as if the hen were a
banyan-tree, and presently even they disappear ; she settles
down comfortably, and all are wrapped in a slumberous
silence. i

8. And as I sitby the hour, watching their winning ways,’

and see all the steps of this sleepy subsidence, I can but re-

member that outburst of love and sorrow from the lips of '

Him who, though He came to earth from a dwelling place of
ineffable glory, called nothing unclean because it was com-
mon, found no homely detail too homely or too trivial to
illustrate the F ather’s love, but from the birds of the air, the
‘ﬁsh of the sea, the lilies of the ﬁeld, the stones in the street,
the foxes in their holes, thepatch on a coat, the oxen in the

furrow, the sheep in the pit, the camel underhis burden, drew‘

lessons of divinepity and patience, of heavenly duty and de-
light.
 9. Standing in the presence of the great congregation,

seeing, as never man saw, the hypocrisy and the iniquity

gathered before Him,—seeing too, alas ! the calamities and
the woe, that awaited this doomed people, a god-like pity
overbears His righteous indignation, and cries out in pas-
sionate appeal, “ 0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the
prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how
often would I have gathered thy children together, even as
a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would
not! ”   i
