relatives. The intended competitors were expected to sustain
the long-established repltations of their several names, and
they were admonished of thle disgrace of defeat. They were
cheered by the men, and stimullated by tle smiles and tears of
the other sex. The rewards were recalled to their minds; they
were fortifiedl by prayers to the saints; and then they were dismissed amnid the cries and the wishes of the nmultitude to seek
their allotted places benleathl the stern of the galley of state.
The city of Venice is dividled into two neiirlv equal parts by
a channel iimuch broader thain tlhat of the ordilary passages of
the town. This dividitng alrterv, fi'omll its superior size and
depth, and its greater importnance, is catlled the granld canal.
Its course is not unlike that of an undulating lint, w lich greatly
increases its length.  As it is n1ucl} used by thle larger boats of
the bay--beiLng in fact a sort of secontlday' port--and its width
is so considerable, it has throughout the whole distatince but one
bridge-the celebrated Rialto. Tlje regatta was to be held on
this canal, which offerted the requisites ot length and space, and
which, as it was lined w\ith imost of the palaces of the principal
senators, atfforded all the facilities necessary for viewing the
struggle.
In passing fromn one end of this long course to the other, the
men destined for the race were not permlitted to make any ex.
ertion.  Their eyes roamied over the gorgeous hangings, wMlich,
as is still wont throulghbout Italv on all days of festa, floated
fromi every window, tJand oin groups of fetllales in rich attirc,
brilliant with the peculiar chlarmlis of the famned Venetian beauty
that clustered in tite balconi,es. Those who were domestics rose
anld anlswered to the encouraging signials tllrovn fromn above, as
they passed the palaces of their miastters; vwhile those who were
watermen of the public endeavored to gather hope among the
syimpathizing faces of the nmultitude.
At length every formality had been dulyl observed, and the
competitors asstumed their places. The gondolas were much
larger th:an those colmmonly used, and each was manned by
three waterlmen in the center, directed 1lv a fourth, who, standing on the little deck in the sterln,.steted while he aided to
imXpel the boat. There were light, low staffs in the bows, with
flags tlhat bore the distilngutishing colors of several noble families
of thle republic, or which had such other simple devices as had
been suggested by the fancies of those to whom they belonged.

and parry, were giv-e11; a wlhirling of the boats, like the prancing of curbed racers,,ulccec led; and then att the report of a gun,
thle whole darltt.d away as if thle gondolas were impelled by volition. The start;as' followed by a shout which passed swiftly
along tlhe canal, and an eager naitation of heads that went from
balcony to balcony, till tlhe symlpathetic movemlent was communicated to thle grave loald under which the lBucentaur labored.
For a few miniltes tile difference in force antd skill was not
verv obvious. Eacih gondola glidledl alotlg the element, apparentlv with tlhat ease with w*hich a ligilt-winged swallow skilns
the lake, an(d with no visible advantage to alny one of the ten.
Then, as more art itn himl whlo steered, or greater powers of endurance in thlose whlo rowcld, or some of the latent properties of
the boat itself came into service, tile cluster of little barks which
had( comle off like a closely united flock of birds taking flight together in alarm, began to open till they foried a long and vacillating line in thie centre of the passage. The wlole train
shot beneathl the bridge, so near each other as to render it still
doubtful which was to conquer, and tile exciting strife caine
more in view of the principal personages of the city
But here those radical qualities, which insure success in efforts of this nature manifested themselves. The weaker began
to yield, the train to lengtlhen, and hopes and fears to increase,
until those in the fiont presented the exhilarating spectacle of
success, while those behind offered the still more noble siglit of
men struggling without hope. Gradually the distance between
the boats inlcreased, while that between them and the goal grew
rapidly less, until three of those in advance camne in, like glancing arrows, beneath the stern of the Bucentaur, with scarce a
length between them. The prize was won, the conquerors were
rewarded, and the artillery gave forth the usual signals of rejoicing. Music answered to the roar of cantnon and the peals
of bells, while sympathy with success, that predominant and so
often dangerous principle of our nature, drew shouts even from
the disappointed.
The clamor ceased, and a herald proclaimed aloud the commencement of a new and a different struggle. The last, and
what might be termed the national race, had been limited, by
an ancient usage, to the known and recognized gondoliers of
Venice. The prize had been awarded ty the state, and the
whole affair had somewhat of an official and political character.
It was now announced, however, that a race was to be run in
which the reward was open to all competitors, without question

ing as to their origin, or as to tLheir orllinarv occupations.  An
oar of gold, to which was attached a clainl of tile samne precious
metal, exhibited as the boone of the doge to himt who showed
most dexterity and strength in thlis new struggle; while a similar ornament of silver, was to be the portion of him who showed
the second best dexterity and bottom. A mlilic boat of less precious metal was the thirfd prize. The gotdolas were to be the
usual light vehicles of the caiials, and as the object was to di.splay the peculliar skill of that city of islands, but one oarsman
was allowedl to each, on whom would necessarily fall the whole
duty of guiding while ihe impelled his little bark. Any of those
who had beell entgaged in the previoas trial were admnitted to
tlhis: and all desirous of takint part in the new strnggle were
commtna,ded to conme beneatlh the stern of the Buicentaur, within
a prescribed number of Iinites, that iinote ilight be had of their
wishes. As notice of this arrantgement lhad been previously
given, the interval between the two races was not IonLr.
The first who caine out of thle crowd of boats which environed the vacant place that hlad beeni left for the competitors,
was a gondolier of the public landing, well known for his skill
with the oar, and his song on the cantal.
" Ilow art thou called, anit in whose namI e dost thou put thy
chance?" demanded the herald of this aquatic course.
"All know ime for Bartolomteo, one whlo lives between the
Piazzetta and the Lido, and, like a loyal VeWietian, I trust in
San Teodoro."
"Thou art well protected; take thy place and await thy fortulle."
The conscious waterman swept the water with a back stroke
of hlis blade, and the litht gondola whlirled away into the centre of the vacant spot like a swan giving a sudden glance aside.
"And who art thlou!" demlanded the official of the next that
catne.
"Enrico, a gondolier of Fusina  I come to try my oars with
the braggarts of the canals."
"In whom is thy trust!"
"Sant' Antonio di Padtla."
"Thou wilt need his aid, though we commend thy spirit.
Enter and take place."--"And wlho art thotui?" he continued, to
anothler, when the second d had imitated the easy skill of the first.
" I am calledl Gitno of Calabria, a gondolier in private service."
"What noble retaineth tlhee?"
"The illustrious and most excellent Don Camillo Monforte,
102Tl'IlE LADIES' READER.
DIuca atld Lord of Sant' Agata in Napoli, and of right a senator
in NVenice."
"Thou shouldst have come of Padun, friend, by thy knowledge of the laws! Dost thou trust in him thou servest for the
victory?"
There was a movement among tlhe senators at the answer of
Gino; and the half-terrified varlet thought he perceived frowns
gathering on more tlihan one brow. IIe looked around in quest
of him whose greatness lie had vaunted, as if he sought succor.
" Wilt thou name thy support in this great trial of force "
resuined the herald.
"My master," uttered the terrified Gino, "St. Januarius, and
St. Mark."
"Thou art well defended. Shoauld the two latter fail thee,
thou mayest surely count on the first!"
"Signor Monforte hlas an illustrious name, and he is welcome
to our Venetian sports," observed the doge, slightly bending
his head toward the young Calabrian noble, who stood at no
eat distance in a gondola of state, regarding the scene with a
deeply-interested countenance.'1his cautious interruption of
the pleasantries of the official was acknowledged by a low reverence, and the matter proceeded.
"Take thy station, Gino of Calabria, and a happy fortune be
thine," said the latter; then turning to another, he asked in
surprise-" Why art thou here?"
"'I come to try my gondola's swiftness."
"Thou art old and unequal to this struggle; husband thy
strength for daily toil. An ill-advised ambition hath put thee
on this useless trial."
The new aspirant had forced a common fisherman's gondola,
of no bad shape and of sufficient lightness, but which bore about
it all the vulgar signs of its daily uses, beneath the gallery of
the Bucentaur. He received the rebuke meekly, and was about
to turn his boat aside, though with a sorrowing and mortified
eye, when a sign from the doge arrested his arm.
"Question of him, as of wont," said the prince.
"Hlow art thou named I" continued the reluctant official,
who, like all of subordinate condition, had far more jealousy of
the dignity of the sports he directed than his superior.
"1 am known as Antonio, a fisherman of the Lagunes."
"Thou art old!"
"Signore, none know it better than 1. It is sixty summers
tince I first threw net or line into the water."
103104
"Nor att thou clad as befitteth one who cotmeth before the
state of Venice in a regatta."
" I am here in the best that I have. Let tlletm who would do
the nobles greater honor coame in better."
" Thy limbs are uncovered-thy bosomn bare--thy sinews feeble-go to; thou art ill advised to interrupt the pleasures of the
nobles by this levity."
Again Antonio would have shrunk from the ten thousand
eyes that shone upon him, when the calm voice of the doge
once more came to his aid.
"The struggle is open to all," said the sovereign; "still I
would advise the poor and aged man to take counsel; give him
silver, for want uirges him to this hopeless trial."
" Thou hearest; almns are offered thee; but give place to those
who are stronger and more seemnly for the sport."
"I will obey, as is the duty of one borll anld accustomed to
poverty. They said the race was open t:, all, and I crave the
pardon of the nobles, since I nmeant to d1o, thlem no dishonor."
"Justice in the palace, and justice onl the canals," hastily observed the prince. "If hle will continle, it is right. It is the
pride of Sainit IMark that his hal:ances are held with an even
Ftasnd."
A murmulr of applause succeeded the specious sentiment, for
the powerful rarely affect thle noble attribute of justice, hlowever
limited may be its exercise, withont their words finding an echo
in the tongues of the selfish.
"Thou liearest-his highness, who is the voice of a mighty
state, says thou mayest retmain:-thougl l thou art still advised
to withdraw."
"I will then see what virtue is left in this naked arm," returned Antonio, easting  a mourniful glance, and one that was
not entirely free fi'oml the latent vanity of man, at his neagre
and thlreadbare attire. "The limb hath its sears, but the infidels mav have spared enough for the little I ask."
"In whom is thy faith?"
"    Bl ssed St. Anthony, of the Miraculoutts Draught."
"Take thly place!--Ha! here cometh one unwillina, to be
known! How now! who appears with so false' face V
" Call me, Mask."
"So neat and just a leg and arm need not have hid their fellow the countenance. Is it your highness's pleasure that one
disguised should be entered for the sports?"
"Doubt it not. A mask is sacred in Venice. It is the glorv

of our excellent and wise laws, that he who seecketh to dwell
within the privacy of his own thoughllts, and to keel) aloof fronm
curiosity by shadowing his feiatures, rangetll our streets and
canals, as if lie dwelt in the security of hlis own abode. Such
are the hligh privileges of liberty, and suchli it is to be a citizen
of a generous, a magnanimious, anld a free state!"
A thousand bowed in approbation of the sentiment, and a
rumor passed froin mouth:l to motith that a young noble was
about to try his strengthl in the regatta, in comlplilnent to some
wayward bealty.
"Such is justice!" exclaimed the herald, in a loud voice, admiration apparently overcoming respect in the ardor of the moment. " Happy is he that is born in Venice, and envied are
the people in whose councils wisdom and Inercy preside, like
lovely and benignant sisters! On whom dN;t tllhou rely I"
"Mine own arm.i"
"Ha! This is inlpious! None so presulrming may enter into
these privileged sports."
The hurried exclamation of the herald was accompanied by
a general stir, such as denotes sudden an(d strong emotion in a
multitude.
" The children of the republic are protected by an even hand,"
observed the venerable prince. " It formeth our just pride, and
blessed St. Mark forbid that aught resenmbling vain-glory should
be uttered I but it is truly our boast that we know no difference between our subjects of the islands, or those of the Dalmatian coast; between Padua or Candia; Corfu or St. Giorgio.
Still it is not permitted for any to refuse the intervention of the
saints."
"Namie thy patron, or quit the place," continued the observant herald, anew.
The stranger paused, as if he looked into his mind, and then
he answered"San Giovanni of the wilderness."
"Thou namest one of blessed nmemory!"
"I name him who may have pity on me in this living desert."
"The temper of thy soul is best known to thyself, but this
reverend rank of patricians, yonder brilliant show of beauty,
and that goodly multitude may claim another name. Take thy
place."
While the herald proceeded to take the names of three or
four more applicants, all gondoliers in private service, a mtur5*

inlir ran throutgh the spectators, which proved how much their
inrtrest and curiositv had beeni awaketned by the replies ald
appearance of thle two last competitors.  In lthe meantime, the
young nobles wlho entertained those who caime last, began to
move among thle throngs of boats with the intention of mnaking
such manifestations of their gallant desires and personal devo.
tion as suited the custoins and opinions of the age.  The 1i4t
was now proclaimlced to tbe full, and the gonldolas were towed
otf, as before, toward the starting point, ieaving thu place beneath the stern of the Bucentaur vaciant. The scene tilat followed consequently passed directly before the eyes of those
grave men, who charged themselves with most of the private
interests, as well as with the public concerns of Venice.
It has been said that the gontdtolas which were to contend in
the race, had been towed( toward the plac,e of starting, in order
that the men mighlt enter on the struggtle witlh unlliminished
vigor. In this precaution, even the hlunilble anld half-clad fisherinan had not been neglected, but his boat, like the others,
was attached to the Iarger barges to tile larger bes twhicl this duty had been assigned.  Still, as he passed along the canal, before the crowdedl
balconies and groaning, vessels which line(d its sides, there arose
that scornftill and deriding laugh, wlich seems ever to grow
more stronlg and bold as mIlisftrtunle weighs Inost heavily on its
subject.
The old man was not unconscious of the remarks of which
lie was the subject; and, as it is rare indeed that our sensibilities do not survive our better fortunes, even lie was so far collscious of a fall as not to be callous to contempt thus openlexpressed.  He looked wistfully on vceriy side of him, and
seenmed to search in every eye he encountered some portion of
the sympathy which his meek and humble feelings still craved.
But even the men of his caste and profi ssion thlrew jibes upon
his ear; and though of all the competitors perhaps the one
whose motives most hallowed his atnbition, he was held to be
the only proper subject of mnirth. For the solution of this revolting trait of human character, we are not to look to Venice
and her institutions, since it is known that none are so arrogant
on occasions as the ridden, and that the abject and insolent spirits are usually tenants of the same bosom.
The movement of the'boats brought those of the masked
watermnan and the subject of these taunts side Iy side.
"Thou art not the favorite in this strife," observed the
former, when a fresh burst of jibes were showered on the head
106THE LADIIES' READER.
of his unresisting associate. Thou hast not been sufficiently
heedlfuil of thy attire; for this is a town of luxury, and he who
woulld ileet applautse mu.st appear on the canals in the guise of
one less borne tupon by fortunle."
"I know themt! I know them!" returned tne fisherman;
"they are all led away by their pride, and they think ill of one
who catinnot share in thelir vanities. But, friend unknown, I
have brotlught with ime a face which, old thoutgh it be, and wrirlkled, and worn by the weatler like the stonves of the sea-shlore,
is uncovered to ttle eye and without shamell."
"There may be reasons whicll thou knowest not why I wear
a mask. ItBut if imv face be Ilid, the limbs are bare, and thou
seest there is no liack of sinew's to nlake good tllat which I
have undertaken.  Thou shouldst have tlloughlt better of the
ma;tter ere thou pittest tlhyselt in the way of so Innuch tmortification.  Defeat will not cause the people to treat thee mtore
tenderlv."
"If Imy sinews are old and stiffened, Signor Mask, they are
long used to toil.  As to shame, if it is a shame to be below
the rest of mankind in fortune, it will not now coime for the
first time. A heavv sorrow hlatlh befallen Ine, and this race may
lighten thte burlen of grief.  I sh1all not pretend that I hear this
laughter, and all thlese scornful specciles as one listtens to the
evening breeze on the Iagunes-for a Iman is still a man, though
he lives with the humblest, and eats of the coarsest. But let it
pass; Sant' Antonio will give me heart to bear it."
"Thou hast a stout Inind, fishermlan; andl I would gladly
pray my patron to grant tlhee a stronger arm, but that I have
much need of this victory myself. NWNilt thlou be content with
the second prize, if, by any inanner of skill, I migrht aid thee in
thy efforts?-for, I suppose, the metal of the third is as little to
thy taste as it is to mv own."
"Nay, I count not on gold or silver."
"Can the honor of suchl a struggle awaken the pride of one
like tlhee?"
The old man looked earnestly at his companion; but he
sh( ok his head without answer. Fresh merriment, at his expense, caused him to bend his face toward the scoffers; and he
perceived they were jlst then passing a nutnerous group of his
fellows of the Lagllnes, who seemed to feel that his unjustifiable
amibition reflected, in some degree, on the honor of their whole
body.
"How, now, old Antonio?" shouted the boldest of the band
107TIE LADIES' RIEAIEiR.
-" is it not enoughr that thlou hast xwon thle lhonors of the net,
but thou wouldst have a goldet oar at thly necki"
"We shall yet see him of the setlate!" cried a seconl.
" I-Ie standethl in need of the horned -bonnet for his naked
head," continued a third.  " We shall see tile brave Admiral
Antontio sailing in the BIucentaur with the nobles of the
land!"
Their sallies were succ eeded by coarse laiughter.  Even the
fair in the bah:onies were not ulninfltlcnceeed by these consta.nt
jibes, andl the apparent discrepancy bvetween the condlition and
the mlleans of so unusual a pretender to the honors of the regatta. The purlpose of the oldM lman wa:veret(; but he seemied
goaded by somell intward incentitve that still enabled hiln to
maintain hlis giroulnd. His c    io c panion clos.ely watelied the varyitng expression of a countenance thl.t was far too little trlained
in deception to conceal the feelings withlin; an(l, as they approached the plIace of starting, he agtlitn spoke.
"Thou mayest vet withdraw,"   e said; " why should one of
thy years make the little time he has to stay bitter, by bearing
the ridicule of his associates for the rest of his life? "?
",'-t. Anthonly did a greater wonler whe   hclie caused the
fishes to come upon the waters to hoar his preaching, anld I will
not show a cow'irdly heart at a moment whenl thelre is iimost
need of resolution."
The masked waterman crossed himself devoutlv; and relinquishing all further design to persuade the other to abandon
the fruiitless contest, ihe gave all Ilis tloughlts to his own iliterest
in the coming struggle.
The narrowness ofI most of the canals of Venice, with tlte innumerable anig'les and thle con.statnt passing, have given rise to a
ftshiou of construction and of rowitng that are so peculiar to
that city atnd its iminmediate depe dencies, as to require some explanation. The readler has doulbtless already understood that a
gondola is a long, narrow, and light boat, adapted to the uses
of the place, ttnd distinct fromll the wherries of all other towns.
The distance between the dwellin~s on miost of the canals, is so
small, that the width of the latter does not admit of the use of
oars on both sides at the saime titme.  The necessity of collatantly turning aside to give roomn for others, and the frequency
of the bridges and the corners, have sugwested the expediency
of placing the face of the waterman in the direction in which
the boat is steering, and of course of keeping him  on his feet.
As every gondola, when fiilly equipped, has its pavilicn in the
108'rilE  LAb)IE ES' RIEADIER.
centre, the height of the latter renders it nlecessary to place hill
whlo steers on sulch an elevation, as will enable hiln to overlook
it. From  these several causes, a one-oared boat in Venice is
propelled by a gondolier who stands on a little angular (leck in
its stern, formed like tile low roof of a hiouie; and the stroke of
thle oar is given by a push inistead of a pull, as is commnon elsewhere. This lhabit of rowingl erect, lhowever, which is usually
done by a forward, instead of a backward, Inovement of the
body is not uinfrequent in all the ports of the Mediterranealn,
thoutrgh in no other is there a boat wllich resembles the gondola
in all its properties or uises. The upright position of the gondolier requlires that the pivot oin w)hich the oar rests should have
a co)rrespondilngr elevation; and thllere is, consleqtently, a species
of bumnkiin raised fronl tlhe side of the boat to thle desired height,
and wlichl, Ibeing forllued of a crooked and( very irregullar knee of
wood, lIas two or three row -locks, one above the other, to suit
tlhe stature of ditfierent individuals, or to give a broader or narrower sweep of the' blade as the movemnent shall require. As
there is frequlent occasion to ca.st the oar from one of these rowlocks to thle othler, andl no,t unfrequently to change its side, it
rests in a \verv open bed; and the instrument is kept in its
place by great dexterity alone, and by a perfect knowledge of
the means of accommodating the force and the rapidity of tle
effort to the forward mtovenient of the boat and the resistance
of the water. All these diflficulties united( rendler skill in a gondolier one of the most (lelicate branches of a waterman's art, as
it is clear that muscular strength alone, tllough of great aid, can
avail but little in such a practice.
The great canal of Venice, following its windings, being more
thani a leaglue in length, the distance in the present race was reduccd nearly lIalf by causing the boats to start from the Rialto.
At this point, then, the gondolas were all assembled, attended
by those who were to place them. As the whole of the population, which befo,re had been extended along the entire course
of the water, was now crowded between the bridge and the
Bucentaur, the long and graceful avenue resembled a vista of
human heads.   It was an imposing sight to look along that
bright and living lane, and the hearts of each competitor beat
high, as hlope, or pride, or apprehension became the feeling of
the nioment.
"Gino of Calabria," cried the marshal who placed the gondolas, "thy station is on the right.  Take it, and St. Januarius
speed thee "

For many a coal-black tribe and cany spear,
The hireling guard of Misraim's throne, were there;
From distant Cush they trooped. a warrior train,
Siwah's green isle and Senar's marly plain:
On either wing their fiery coursers check
The parched and sinewry sons of Amalek;
While close behind, inured to feast on blood,
Decked in Behemoth's spoils, the tall Shangalla strode.'Mid blazing helms and bucklers rough with gold,
Saw ye how swift the scythed chariots rolled?
Lo, these are they whom, lords of Afric's fates,

Where, flusIed with power and vengeance, Pharoab rode I

The circling horns of Egypt's chivalry.
On earth's last margin, throng the weeping train;
Their cloudy guide moves on:-" And must we swim the main?"'Mid the light spray their snorting camels stood,
Nor bathed a fetlock in the nauseous flood:
He comes--their leader comes I--the man of God
O'er the wide waters lifts his mighty rod,
And onward treads. The circling waves retreat,
In hoarse deep murmurs from his hloly feet,
And the chased surges, inly roaring, show
The hard wet sand and coral hills below.
With limbs that falter, and with hearts that swell,
Down, down they pass-a steep and slippery dell;
Around them rise, in pristine chaos hurled,
The ancient rocks, the secrets of the world;
And flowers that blush beneath the ocean green,
And caves, the sea-calves' low-roofed haunt, are seen.
Down, safely down the narrow pass they tread;
The beetling waters storm above their head:
While far behind retires the sinking day,
And fades on Edom's hills its latest ray.
Yet not from Israel fled the friendly light,
Or dark to them, or cheerless came the night;
Still in their van, along that dreadful road,
Blazed broad and fierce the braudished torch of GAd.

PARADISE AND THE PERI.-M ooLL
One morn a Peri at the gate
Of Fden stood, disconsolate;
And as she listen'd to ttle Springs
Of Life withlin. like mulsic flowing,
And cauglht the lightt upon her wings
Throughl thle lalf-open portal glowing,
She wept to think her recreant rac
Should e'er have lost that gloriotus place I
The glorious Angel, who was keeping
The gates of Light, beheld her weeping;
And, as he nearer drew and listen'd
To her tad son, a teardrop glisten'd
Within lhis eyelids, like the spray
Fromn Eden's fountain, when it lies
On the blue tlow'r, which--Brahtnins sayBlooims nowhtere but in Paradise.
"Nymph of a fair but erring lilne! "
Gentlvy he said--" One hlope is tline.'Tis written inl the Book of Fate,

The gift thta is most dear to ieavren  
Go, seek it, and redeem thy sin-'Tis swvet to let the Pardou'd in."
But whlither slhall the Spirit go
To tind this gift for Heaven?--" I know
The wealtlh." she cries, "of every urn,
In which unnumber'd rubies burn,
Beneath the pillars of Chilminar;
I know where the Isles of Perfume are
Many a fathom down in the sea,
To the south of sun-bright Araby;
I know, too, where the Genii hid
The jewell'd cup of thleir King Jamshid,
With Life's elixir sparkling highBut gifts like these are not for the sky.
Where was there ever a gem that shone
Like the steps of Allah's wonderful Throue?
And the Drops of Life-O, what would they be
In the boundless Deep of Eternity?  
Downward the Peri turns her gaze,
And, through the war field's bloody haze
Beholds a youthful warrior stand,
Alone beside his native riverThe red blade broken in his hand,
And the last arrow in hi. quiver.

Now among Afric's lunar Mountains,
Far to the South, the Peri lighted;
And sleek'd her plumage at the fountains

Where oft the Genii of the Floods
Dance round the cradle 6f their Nile,

Lisping th' eternal name of God

And seeking for its home again.

THE LANIDING OF THE MAYFLOWER.-EoWA^D EVEUTrT.
Do you think, sir, as we repose beneath this splendid pavilion, adorned by the hand of taste, blooming with festive garlands, wreathed with the stars and stripes of this great republic,
resounding with strains of heart-stirring music, that, merely because it stands upon the soil of Barnstable, we form any idea
of the spot as it appeared to Captain Miles Standish, and his
companions, on the 15th or 16th of November, 16201 Oh, no,
sir. Let us go up for a moment, in itmagination, to yonder hill,
which overlooks the village and the bay, and suppose ourselves
standing there on some bleak, ungenial morning, in the middle
of November of that year. The coast is fringed with ice.
Dr,earv forests, interspersed with sanldy tracts fill the background. Nothing of humanity quickens on the spot, save a
few roaming savages, who, ill-provided with what even they
deein the necessaries of life, are digging with their fingers a
scanty repast out of the frozen sands. No friendly lighthouses
had as yet hung up their cressets upon vour headlands; no
brave pilot-boat was hovering like a sea-bird on the tops of the
waves, beyond the Cape, to guide the shattered bark to its harbor; no charts and soundings made the secret pathways of the
deep as plain as a gravelled road through a lawn; no comfortable dwellings along the line of the shore, and where are now
your well-inhabited lsreets, spoke a welcome to the Pilgrim;
no steeple poured the music of Sabbath morn into tile ear of
the fulgitive for conscience' sake. Primeval wildness and native desolation brood over sea and land; and from the 9th of
November, when, after a most calamitous voyage, the Mayflower first came to anchor in Provincetown harbor, to the end
of December, the entire male portion of the company was occupied, for the greater part of every day, and often by night as
well as by day, in exploring the coast and seeking a place of
rest, amidst perils from the savages, from the unknown shore,
and the elements, which it makes one's heart bleed to think upon.
But this dreary waste, which we thus contemplate in imagination, and which they traversed in sad reality, is a chosen land.
It is a theatre upon which an all-glorious drama is to be enacted. On this frozen soil,-driven from the ivy-clad churches
of their mother land,--escaped, at last, from loathsome prisons
-the meek fathers of a pure.chureh will lay the spirititwl hase123TlIE' LAD)1ES' READER.
Ilent of their templple. Iere, on tlhe everlasting rock of liberty,
they will establish the foundation of a free State.  Beneath its
ungenial wintry sky, principles of social right, institutions of
civil government, shall gertminate, in which, what seelmed tile
Utopian dreams of visionary sages, are to be more than realized.
But let us contemplate, for a Ionacuit, the instrumlents selected by'Providernce, for this political and imoral creation.
IHowevel u,lpromising the field of action, the agents must correspond with the excellence of the work. The time is truly
auspicious.  Enlgland is well supplied with all the materials of
a generos enterpririse. She is in the filll affluence of her wealth
of intellect andll c haracter. The age of Elizabeth has passed and
garnere( l up its treasures. The age of the common wealth, silent
and unsu,spected, is ripening toward its harvest of great men.
The B3urli,,rlhs and Cecils have sounded the depths of statesmanship; ithe Drakes and Raleiglls have run the whIole round
of chivalry land adventure; the Cokes and Bacons are silreading
the light of their ma.ster-ilinds through the entire universe of
philo.sophy and law. OuQt of a generation of which me n like
these are the guides and lights, it cannot be dlilficult to select
the leaders of any lofty undettaaking; and, through their influe(nce, to secure to it tile protection of royalty.  But, alas, for
New England     No, sir, happily for New England, Providence
works not with humanl inlstrumnents. Not miany wise men after
tile flesh, not many mighty, not mlany noble, are called. The
stars of human greatness, that glitter in a court, are not destined
to rise on the lowering horizon of the despised colony. The
feeble company of Pilgrimns is not to be marsmalled by gartered statesmten, or mitred prelates.  Fleets will not be despatched to convoy the little band, nor aruies to protect it Had
there been lhonors to be won, or pleasures to be enjoyed, or
plunder to be grasped, hungry courtiers, midsummer friends,
godless adventurers would have eaten out the heart of the enterprise.  Silken Buckinghams and Somersets would hare
blasted it with their patronage. But, safe amidst their unenvied perils, strong in their inoffensive weakness, rich in their
untemrpting poverty, the patient fiugitives are permitted to pursue unmolested the thorny paths of tribulation; and, landed at
last on the unfriendly shore, the hosts of God, in the frozen
mail of December, encamp around the dwellings of the just:
"Stem famine guards the solitary coast,
And winter barricades the realms of frost."
1 24TIME LADIES' RtEAD)ER.
While Bacon is attuning the sweetest strains of his honeyed
eloquence to sooth the dull ear of a crowned pedant, and his
great rival, only less obsequious, is on Ihis knees to deprecate
the royal displeasure, the futulre founders of the new republic
beyond the sea are training up for their illustrioxus mission, itn
obscurity, hardsllip, and weary exile in a foreign land.
And now-for the fulness of tiime is conic--let us go up
once more, in imagination, to yondler hill, and look oult upon
the Noveimiber scene. That siingle dark speelk, jiist discernible
through the perspective glass, on the waste of waters, is the
fated vessel. The stormn moans tlhrough her tattered canvas, as
she creeps, almost sinking, to her anchorage in l'rovincetown
harbor; and there she lies, with all her treasures, not of silver
and gold, (for of these slle has none,) but of courage, of patience, of zeal, of high spiritual dari,ng. So often ais I dwell in
imagination on this scene; when I consider the condition of
the Mayflower, utterly incapable, as she was, of living through
another gale; when I survey the terriblle front presented by our
coast to the navigator who, unnacquainted with its channels and
roadsteads, should approach it inl the stormy season, I dare not
call it a mere piece of good fortuine, tllat the general lnorth and
south wall of the slhore of New England should!,e broken by
this extraordinary projection of the Cape, running out into the
ocean a hundred miles, as if on purpose to receive antd encircle
the precious vessel. As I now see her, freighltedl with the destinies of a continent, barely escaped fromn the perils of the deep,
approaching the shore precisely where the broad sweep of this
most remarkable headland presents almost the only point, at
which, for hundreds of miles, she could, with any ease, have
made a harbor, and this, perhaps, the very best on tlhe seaboard, I feel my spirit raised above the sphere of mere natural
agencies. I see the,nmountains of New Englan(d rising froln
their rocky thrones.  They rush forward ilto the ocean, settling down as they advance; and there they range themselves,
as a mnighty bulwark around the heaven-directed vessel. Yes,
the everlasting God himself stretches out.the arm of his mercy
and his power, in substantial manifestation, and gathers the
meek company of his worshippers as in the hollow of his haiind.

THIE TWO FPRIENDS.-WoanwoaTsa
We talked with open heart and tongue,
Affectionate atld true;
A pair of friends, though I was young,
And Matthew seventy-two.
We lay beneath a spreading oak,
Beside a mosy seat;
And frtom the turf a fountain broke,
Aud gurgled at our feet.
"Notw, Matthew," said I,` let us match
Thlis water's pleasant tuneo
With some old border-song. or catch
Thlat suits a summer's noon;
O r of the churcel clock and the chines
Sing here beneath the sllade,
That ialfr-mad thinlg of witty rhynes
Which you last April made."
In silence iMatthew lay, and eved
Tile spring hneath the tree;
And thtrs the dear old tan replied,
The gray-haired man of glee.
"No check, no stay, this streamlet fears
How merrily it goes i'Twill murmur on a tllousand years,
And flow as it uow flows.
"And here, on this delightful day,
I cannot choose but think
How oft a vigorous mnan, I lay
Beside tihis fountain's brink.
"My eyes are dim with childish tears,
My heart is idly stirred,
For the same sound was in my ears
Which iu those days I heard.
"Thus fares it still in our decay;
Alnd yet the wiser mind
Mourns less for what age takes away,
Than what it leaves behiud.
"The blackbird amid leafy trees,
The lark above the hill,
Let loose their carols when they please,
Are quiet when they will.
126THE LADIES' IIEADI 2:.' With Nature never do they wage
A foolish strift; they see
A happy youtll, and their old atge
Is beautiftul and free.
"But we are pressed by heavy laws,
And often, glad no more,
We wear a face of joy, because
We have been glad of yore.
"If there be one who need bemoan
Ilis kindred laid in earth,
The houhellold lenrts that were his own,
It is the man of mirtlh.
"My days, my friend, are almost gone,
My life has been approved;
Anid mtany love me; but by none
Am I enough beloved."
"Now both himself and me he wrongs,
The manl whto thus complains I
I live and sing my idle songs
Upon these happy plains.
"And, Matthew, for thy children dead,
I'11 be a son to thee I"
At this he grasped my hand, and said,
"Alas I that cannot be."
We rose up from the fountain side;
And down the smooth descent
Of the green sheep-track did we glide;
And through the wood we went.
And, ere we came to Leonard's rock,
He sang those witty rhymes
About the crazy old church clock,
And the bewildered chimes.
LADY CLARA VERE DE VEREi-Tzxxtlow.
Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
Of me you shall not win renown;
You thought to break a country heart
For pastime, ere you went to town.
At me you smiled, but unbeguiled
I saw the snare, and I retired:
The daughter of a hundred Earls,
You are not one to be desired.
127THIE LADIIES' READER.
Lady Clara Vere do Vere,
I ktlow you proud to bear your name,
Your pride is yet no mate for mine,
Too proud to care from whlence I came.
Nor would I break for your svweet sake
A heart that doats on truer charms;
A simple maiden inl her flower
Is worth a hundred coats-of-arms.
Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
Sonme meeker pupil you must find,
For were you queen of all that is,
I could not stoop to such a mind.
You souglht to prove how I could love,
And my disdain is my reply;
The lion on your old stone gates
Is not mlore cold to vou than I.
Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
You put strauge m nleories in my head,
Not thrice your branching limes have blown
Since I behleld tlung Laurence dead.
Oh your sweet e\ces, Nlyour low replies:
A great nchlantrecss you may be:
But there was tihat across his tlroat
Whihll you lhad hardly cared to see.
Lady Clara Vere de Vere;
When thlus lhe met his miother's view,
She had the p asions of her kind,
She spake some certain truths of you.
Indeed I lheard one bitter word
That scarce is fit for you to hear;
Her manners had not that repose
Which stamps the caste of Vere de Vere.
Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
There stands a spectre in your hall;
The guilt of blood is at your door,
You changed a wholesome heart to gall.
You held your course without remorse,
To make him trust his modest worth,
Ar, Laast, you fix'd a vacant stare,
And slew him with your noble birth.
Trust me, Clara Vere de Vere,
From yon blue heavens above us bent;
The grand old gardener and his wife
Smile at the claims of long descent.
Howe'er it be, it seems to me,
T' is only noble to be good;
Kitd hearts are more than coronets,
And simple faithl than Norman blood.
128THE LADIES' READER.
I know you, Clara Vere de Vere:
You pine among your halls and towers:
The languid light of yotur proud eyes
Is wearied of the rolling hours.
In glowing health, with boundless wealth,
But sickening of a vague disease,
You know so ill to deal with time,
You needs must play such pranks as thes
Clara, Clara Vere de Yore,
If time be heavy on your hands,
Are there no beggars at your gate,
Nor any poor about your lands?
Oh I teach the orphan-boy to read,
Or teach the orphan-girl to sow,
Pray heaven for a human heart,
And let the foolish yeoman go.

Bring not here a useless woman,
Hands unuskilful, feet unwilliug;
Bring a wife with nimble fingers,
Heart and hand that move together,
Feet that run on willing errands I"
Smiling answered Hiawatha,
"In the land of the DacoAbhs
Lives the Arrow-maker's daughter,
Minnebaha, Laughing Water,
Handsomest of all the women.
I will bring her to your wigwam,
She shall run upon your errands,
Be your starlight, moonlight, firelighs,
Be the sunlight of my people I"
Still dissuading said Nokomis:
"Bring not to my lodge a stranger
From the land of the Dacotihs I
Very fierce are the Dacotihs,
Often is there war between us,
There are feuds yet uuforgotten,
Wounds that ache and still may open 1'
Laughing answered Hiawatha:
"For that reason, if no other,
Would I wed the fair Dacotah,
That our tribes might be united,
That old feuds might be forgotten,
And old wounds be healed for ever 1"
Tbus departed Hiawatha
To the land of the Dacotahs,
To the land of handsome women;
Striding over moor and meadow,
Through interminable forests,
Through uninterrupted silence.
With his mocasins of magic,
At each stride a mile he measured;
Yet the way seemed long before him,
And his heirt outrun his footsteps;
And he journeyed without resting,
Till he heard the cataract's laughter,
Heard the falls of Minnehaha
Calling to him through the silence.
"Pleasant is the sound 1" he murmured,
Pleasant is the voice that calls me I"
On the outskirts of the forest,'Twixt the shadow and the sunshine,
Herds of fallow deer were feeding,
But they saw not Hiawatha;
To his bow he whispered, " Fail not "
To his arrow whispered, "Swerve notI'
Sent it singing on its errand,
To the red heart of the roebuck;
Threw the deer acer  his shoulder,
130TIlE LAEIXIS' RlEAI)Et                    181
And sped forward without pausing.
At the doorway of his wigwam
Sat the ancient Arrow-maker,
In the laund of the Dacotahs
Making arrow-heads of Jasper,
Arrow-heads of chalcedony.
At his side, in all her beauty,
Sat the lovely Minnehahla,
Sat his daughter, Laughing Water,
Plaiting mats of flags and rushes;
Of the past the old man's thoughts were,
And the nmaiden's of the future.
He was tlhilnking, as he sat there,
Of the days w1hen with such arrows
Hie had struck the deer and bison,
On the Muskediy, the meadow;
Shot the wild goose, flying southward,
On the wing. the clamorous Wiwa;
Thinking of the great war-parties,
How they came to buy his arrows,
Could not tight without his arrows.
Ah, no more such noble warriors
Could be found on eartl as they were I
Now the men were all like women,
Only lised their tongues for weapons I
She was thinking of a lunter,
From another tribe and country,
Young and tall and very handsome,
Who one morning, in the Spnng-time,
Came to buy her father's arrows,
Sat and rested in the wigwam,
Lingered long about the doorway,
Looking back as he departed.
She had heard her father praise him,
Praise his courage and his wisdom;
Would he come again for arrowp
To the falls of Minnehahs?
On the mat her hands lay idle,
And her eyes were very dreamy.
Through their thioughts they heard a foot,tep,
Heard a rustling in the branches,
And with glowing cheeks and forehead,
With the deer upon his shoulders,
Suddenly from out the woodlands
Hiawatha stood before them.
Straight the ancient Arrow-maker
Looked up gravely from his labor,
Laid aside the unfinished arrow,
Bade him enter at the doorway,
Saying, as he rose to meet bim,'Hiawatha. you are welcome I"
At the feet of Laughing Water
181THE LADIES' READER
Hiawatha laid his burden,
Threw the red deer from his shoulders;
And the maiden looked up at him,
Looked up from her mat of rushes,
Said with gentle look and accenrat,
"You are welcome, Hiawatha I"
Very spacious was thle wigwam,
Made of deer-skin dressed and whitened,
With the Gods of the Dacotahs
Drawn and painted on its curtains,
And so tall the doorway, hardly
Hiawatha stooped to enter,
Hardly touched hi eagleteathers
As 4e entered at the doorwayj
Then uprose the Iatughing Vater,
From the ground fiir Minnehaha,
Laid aside her mat unfinished,
Brought forth food and set before them,
Water brought them from the brooklet,
Gave them food in earthen vessels,
Gave them drink in bowls of bass-wood,
Listened while the guest was speaking,
Listened while her father answ crcd,
But not once her lips sie opened,
Not a single word she uttred.
Yes, as in a dream she listened
To the words of iiawatha,
As he talked of old Nokomis,
Who had nursed him in his childhood,
As he told of his companious,
Chibiabos, the musician,
And the very strong man, Kwisind,
And of happiness atd plenty
In the lanld of the Ojibways,
In the pleasant land and peacefuL
" After many years of warfare,
Many years of strife and bloodshed,
There is peace between the Ojibways
And the tribe of the Dacotahs."
Thus continued Hiawatha,
And then added, speaking slowly,
"'That tills peace may last for ever,
And our hands be clasped more closely,
And our hearts be more united,
Give me as my wife this maiden,
Minnehiaha, Laughing Water,
Loveliest of Dactah Women I"
And the ancieut Arrow-maker
Paused a moment ere he answered,
Smoked a little while in silence,
Looked at Hiawatha proudly,
Fondly looked at Laughing Water,
132TIIE LADIES' READEiR.
And made answer very gravely:
"Yes, if Minnehahlla wisles;
Let your heart speak, Minnellala I"
And the lovely Laughing Water
Seemed more lovely, as she stood there,
Neither willinlg nor reluctant,
As she went to Hliawatha,
Softly took the seat beside hinm,
While she said, and blusllhed to say it,
"I will follow you, my hlusband I'
This was Hiawatha's wooing I
Thus it was he won the daughter
Of the atncient Arrow-maker,
In the land of the Dacotahs I
From the wigwam lie departed,
Leading withl him Laughling Water;
falld in hand they went together,
Thlrough the woodland and the meadow,
Left the old man standing lonely
At the doorway of his wigwam,
Heard the Falls of Minnehlaha
Calling to them from the distance,
Crying to them from afar off,
"Fare thee well, O Mininehaha I"
And the ancient Arrow-maker
Turned again unto his labor,
Sat down by his sunny doorway,
Murmuring to himself, and saying:
"Thus it is our daughtrs leave us,
Those we love, and those who love us I
Just when they have learned to help ua,
When we are old and lean upon them,
Comes a youth with flaunting feathers,
With his flute of reeds, a straonger
Wanders pipilng through the village,
Beckons to the fairest maiden,
And she follows where he leads her,
Leaving all tlings for the strangerl"
Pleasant was the journey homeward,
Through interminable forests,
Over meadow, over mountain,
Over river, hill, and hollow.
Short it seened to Hiawatha,
Though they journeyed very slowly,
Though his pace he checked and slackened
To the steps of Laughing Water.
Over wide and rushing rivers
In his arms he bore the maiden;
Light he thought her as a feather,
As the plume upon his head-gear;
Cleared the tangled pathway for her,
Bent aside the swaying branchesll,

And a bed with boughs of hemulock,
And a fire before the doorway

O'er the meadow, through the forest;
All the stars of night looked at them,

That calls, when brimmed her festal caup
A nation's glory, and lher shame,
In silent sadness up.
A nation's glory-be the rest
Forgot-she's canonized his mind;
And it is joy to speak the best

Where the Bard-peasant first drew breath;
A straw-thatched roof above his head,
A straw-wrought couch beneath.
And I have stood beside the pile,
His monument-that tells to heaven
The homage of earth's proudest isle
To that Bard-peasant given I
Bid thy thoughts hover o'er that spot,

And know, however low his lot,
A Poet's pride and power.
The pride that lifted Burns from earth,
The power that gave a child ot song
Ascendency o'er rank and birth,
The rich, the brave, the strong;
And if despondency weigh down
Thy spirit's fluttering pinions then,
Dospair:-thy name is written on
The roll of common men.
There have been loftier themes than his,
And longer scrolls and louder lyres I
And lays lit up with Poesy's
Purer and holier fires:
Yet read the names that know not death;
Few nobler ones than Burns are there;
And few have won a greener wreath
Than that which binds his hair.
His is that language of the heart,
In which the answering heart would speak*
Tbought, word, that bids the warm tear start,
Or the smile light the cheek;

And his that music, to whose tone
The common pul.b of man keeps time,
In oit or castle's mirth or moan,
In cold or sunny clime.
And who bath heard his song, nor kneit
Before its spell with willing knee,
And listen'd, and believed, and felt
The Poet's mastery?
O'er the mind's'a, in calm and storm,
O'er the heart's sunshine and its showers,
O'er Passion's moments bright and warm,
O'er Reasons dark, cold hours;
On fields where brave men "die or do,"
In halls where rings the banquet's mirth,
Where mourners weep, where lovers woo,
From throne to cottage hearth;
What sweet tears dim the eyes unshed,
What wild vows falter on the tonugte,
When "Scots wha hae wi' Wallfce bled,"
Or "Auld Lang Syne" is s,ng!
Pure hopes, that lift the soul above,
Come with your Cotlr's hymn of praie,
And dreams of youth, olnd trtlth, and love,
With "i' L n1:' banks and braes.
And when he breathes his master-lay
Of Alloway's witchl-haunted wall,
All passions in our frames of clay
Come thronging at his call.
Imagination's world of air,
And our own world, its gloom ~nd glee,
Wit, pathos, poetry, are there,
And death's sublimity.
And Burns--though brief the race he ran,
Though rough and dark the path he trod--
Lived-died--in form and soul a Man,

RICHARD DOUBLEDICK'S STORY.--DtcKKEN.
IN the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine, a
relative of mine came limping downi, oil foot, to this town of
Chatham. I call it this town, because if anybody present
knows to a nicety where Rochester ends and Chatham begins,
it is more than I do. IIe was a poor traveller, with not a
farthling in his pocket. Ile sat by the fire in this very loomn,
and he slept one night in a bed that will be occupied to-night
by somne one here.
My relative came down to Chatham, to enlist in a cavalry
reginlent, if a cavalry regiument would have him; if not, to take
King George's shilling from any corporal or sergeant who would
put a bunch of ribbons in his bat. Hlis object was, to get shot;
but, he thought he might as well ridle to death as be at the
trouble of walking.
My relative's Christian name was Richard, but he was better
known as Dick. He dropped his ownl sturname on the road
down, and took up that of Doubledick. i1e was passed as
Richard Doubledick; age, twenty-two; height, five feet ten;
native place, Exmouth; which he hlad never been near in his
life. There was no cavalry in Chatham when he liimped over
the bridge here with half a shoe to his dusty foot, so he enlisted
into a regiment of the line, and was glad to get drunk and forget all about it.
You are to know that this relative of mine had gone wrong
and run wild. His heart was in the right place, but it was
sealed up. He had been betrothed to a good and beautiful
girl whom he had loved better than she-or perhaps even hebelieved; but, in an evil hour, he had given her cause to say to
him, solemnly, "Richard, I will never marry any other man. I
will live single for your sake, but Mary Marshall's lips"-her
name was Mary Marshall--" never address another word to you
on earth. Go, Richard! Heaven forive you!"  This finished
him. This brought him down to Chatham. This made him
Private Richard Doubledick, a deep determination to be shot.
There was not a more dissipated and reckless soldier in
Chatham barracks, in the vear one thousand seven hundred
and ninety-nine, than Private Richard Doubledick. He associated with the dregs of every regiment, he was as seldom sober
as he could be, and was constantly under punishment. It be137THE LADIES' READE.
came clear to the whole barracks, that Private Richard Doubledick would very soon be flogged.
Now, the Captain of Richard Doubledick's company was a
young gentleman not above five years his senior, wlhose eyes
had an expression in them which affected Private Richard
Doubledick in a very remarkable way.  They were bright,
handsome, dark eyes-what are called laughinlg eyes, generally,
and, when serious, rather steady than severe-but, they were
the only eyes now left in his narrowed world that Private
Richard Doubledick cotuld not stand. Unabashed by evil report and punishment, defiant of everything else and everybody
else, he had but to know that those eyes looked at him for a
moment, and he felt ashamed. IIe could not so much as salute
Captain Taunton in the street, like any other officer. He was
reproached and confused-troubled by the mere possibility of
the captain's looking at him. In his worst moments he would
rather turn back and go any distance out of his way, than encounter those two handsome, dark, bricght eyes.
One day, when Private Richard Doubledick came out of the
Black Hole, where he had been passing tlhe last eight-and-forty
tours, and in which retreat he spent a good deal of his tiime, he
was ordered to betake himself to Captain Tauinton's quarters.
In the stale and sqlualid state of a man just out of the black hole,
he had less fancy than ever for being seen by the captain; but,
he was not so mad yet as to disobey orders, and consequently
went up to the terrace overlooking the parade-ground, where
the officers' quarters were; twisting and breaking in his hands,
as he went along, a bit of the straw that had formed the decorative furniture of the black hole.
" Come in I" cried the Captain, when he knocked with his
knuckles at the door. Private Richard Doubledick pulled off'is cap, took a stride forward, and felt very conscious that he
stood in the light of the dark bright eyes.
There was a silent pause. Private Richard Doubledick had
put the straw in his mouth, and was gradually doubling it iup
into his windpipe and choking himself.
"Doubledick," said the Captain, "Do you know where you
are going to?"
"To ruin, sir P" faltered Doubledick.
"Yes," returned the Captain. "And very fast."
Private Richard Doubledick turned the straw of the black
hole in his mouth, and made a miserable salute of acquiescence.
"Doubledick," said the Captain, "since I entered his Ma138THE LADIES' READEI R.
jesty's service, a boy of seventeen, I have been pained to see
many men of promise going that road; but, I have never been
so pained to see a man determined to make the shameful journey, as I have been, ever since you joined the regiment, to see
you."
Private Richard Doubledick began to find a film stealing
over the floor at which he looked; also to find the legs of the
Captain's breakfast-table turning crooked, as if he saw them
through water.
"I am only a common soldier, sir," said he. "It signifies
very little what such a poor brute comes to."
"You are a man," returned the Captain with grave indignation, "of education and superior advantages; and if you say
that, meaning what youe say, you have sunk lower than I had
believed. How low that must be, I leave you to consider;
knowing what I know of your disgrace, and seeing what I
see."
"I hope to get shot soon, sir," said Private Richard Doubledick; "and then the regiment, and the world together, will be
rid of me."
The legs of the table were becoming very crooked. Doubledick, lookilg up to steady his vision, met the eyes that had so
strong an influence over him. lie put his hand befobre his own
eyes, and the breast of his disgrace-jacket swelled as if it would
fly asunder.
" I would rather," said the young Captain, "see this in you,
Doubledick, than I would see five thousand guineas counted
out upon this table for a gift to my good mother. Have you a
notherr  
"I am thankful to say she is dead, sir."
If your praise," returned the Captain, " were sounded from
mouth to mouth through the whole regiment, through the whole
army, through the whole country, you would wish she bad
lived, to say with pride and joy,' He is my son I"'
" Spare me, sir;" said Doubledick. "She would never have
heard any good of me. She would never have had any pride
and joy in owning herself my mother. Love and compassion
she might have had, and would have always had, I know; but
not -    Spare me, sir I I am a broken wretch, quite at your
mercy I" And he turned his face to the wall, and stretched out
his imploring hand.
My friend ---" began the Captain.
"God bless you, sir I" sobbed Private Richard Doubledick.
189THE LADIES' READER.
"Yoiu are at the crisis of your fate. Hold vour course unchanged, a little longer, and you know what mIust happen. I
know even better than you can imagine, that after that has happened, you are lost. No man who could shed those tears could
bear those marks."
" I fully believe it, sir," in a low, shivering voice, said Private
Richard Doubledick.
" But a man in any station can do his duty," said the young
Captain, "and, in doing it, can earn his own respect, even if
his case should be so very unfortunate and so very rare, that he
can earnl no other iman's. A common soldier, poor brute tllough
you called hiIn just now, has this advantage in the storimy titnes
we live in, that he always does his duty before a host of sympathising witnesses. Do vou doubt that he may so do it as to
be extolled through a whole regiment, through a whole army,
through a whole countryl Turn while you may yet retrieve
the past, and try."
"I will! I sk for only one witness, sir," cried Richard, with
a bursting heart.
"I understand you.   I will be a watchful and a faithful
one."'
I have heard from Private Richard Doubledick's own lips,
that he dropped down upon his knee, kissed that officer's hand,
arose, and went out of the light of the dark bright eyes, an
altered ian.
In that year, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine,
the French were in Egypt, in Italy, in Germany, where not?
Napoleon Buonaparte had likewise begun to stir against us in
India, and most men could read the signs of the great tr,ubles
that were coming on. In the very next year, when w. formed
an alliance with Austria against hiln, Captain Taunon's regiment was on service in India, And there was not a finer noncommissioned officer in it--no, nor in the whole line-than
Corporal Richard Doubledick.
In eighteen hundred and one, the Indian army were on the
coast of Egypt. Next year was the year of the proclamation
of the short peace, and they were recalled. It had then become well known to thousands of men, that wherever Captain
Taunton, with the dark bright eyes, led, there, close to him,
ever at his side, firm as a rock, true as the sun, and brave as
Mars, would be certain to be found, while life beat in their
hearts, that faimous soldier, Sergeant Richard Doubledick.
Eighteen hundred and five tesides being the great year of
140THE LADIES' READER.
Trafalgar, was a year of hard fighting in India. That year saw
such wonders done by a Sergeant-Major, who cut his way,
single-handed, through a solid mass of men, recovered the colors of his regiment which had been seized from the hand of a
poor boy shot through the heart, and rescued his wounded cap,
tain, who was down, and in a very jungle of horses' hoofs and
sabres-saw such wonders done, I say, by this brave SergeantMajor, that he was specially made the bearer of the colors he
had won; and Ensign Ricilard Doubledick had risen from the
canks.
Sorely cut up in every battle, but always reinforced by the
bravest of men-for, the fame of following the old colors, shot
-hrough and through, whichl Ensign Richard Doubledick had
saved, inspired all breasts-thllis regiment fou glit its way through
the Peninsular war, up to the investment of B adajos in eighteen
hundred and twelve.  Again and again it had been cheered
through the British ranks until the tears had sprung into men's
eyes at the mere hearing of the mighty British voice so exultant in their valor; and there was not a drummer-boy but knew
the legend, that wherever the two friends, Major Taunton, with
the dark bright eyes, and Ensign Richard Doubledick, who was
devoted to him, were seen to go, there the boldest spirits in the
English army became wild to follow.
One day, at Badajos-not in the great storming, but in repelling a hot sally of the besieged upon our men at work in the
trenches, who had given way, the two officers found themselves
hurrying forward, face to face, against a party of French infantry
who made a stand. There was an officer at their head, encouraging his men-a courageous, handsome, gallant officer of fiveand-thirty-whom Doubledick saw hurriedly, almost momentarily, but saw well. He particularly noticed this officer waving
his sword, and rallying his men with an eager and excited cry,
when they fired in obedience to his gesture, and Major Taunton
dropped.
It was over in ten minutes more, and Doubledick returned to
the spot where he had laid the best friend man ever had, on a
coat spread upon the wet clay. Major Taunton's uniform was
opened at the breast, and on his shirt were three little spots of
blood.
"Dear Doubledick," said he, "I am dying."
"For the love of Heaven, no!" exclaimed the other, kneeling
down beside him, and passing his arm round his neck to raise
his head. "Taunton! My preserver. my guardian angel, mv
1.11TUE    LADIES' REAI'E!.R.
witness I Dearest, truest, kindest of human beings I Taunton I
For God's sake!"
The bright dark eyes-so very, very dark now, in the pale
face-smiled upon him; and the hand he had kissed thirteen
years ago, laid itself fondly on his breast.
"Wr'te to my mother. You will see home again. Tell her
how we became friends. It will comfort her, as it comforts
me."
He spoke no more, but faintly signed for a moment towards
his hair as it fluttered in the wind.  The Ensign understood
him. He smiled again when he saw that, and gently turning
his face over on the supporting arm, as if for rest, died, with his
hand upon the breast in which he had revived a soul.
No dry eye looked on Ensign Richard Doubledick, that melancholy day. He buried his friend on the field, and became a
lone, bereaved man. Beyond his duty he appeared to have
but two remaining cares in life: one, to preserve the little
packet of hair lie was to give to Tautlton's mother; the other,
to encounter that French officer who had rallied the men under
wthose fire Tatnton fell. A new legend now began to circulate
among our troops; and it was, that when he and the French
officer caine face to face once more, there would be weeping in
France.
The war went on-and through it went the exact picture of
the French officer on the one side, and the bodily reality upon
the other-until the Battle of Toulouse was fought. In the
returns sent home, appeared these words: "Severely wounded,
but not dangerously, Lieutenant Richard Doubledick."
At Midsummer time, in the year eighteen hundred and fourteen, Lieutenant Richard Doubledick, now a browned soldier,
seven-and-thirty years of age, came home to England, invalided.
He brought the hair with hinm, near his heart. Many a French
officer hadl he seen, since that day; many a dreadful night, in
searching with men and lanterns for his wounded, had he relieved French officers lying disabled; but, the mental picture
and the reality had never come together.
Though he was weak and suffered pain, he lost not an hour
in getting down to Frome, in Somersetshire, where Taunton's
mother lived. In the sweet, compassionate words that naturally
present themselves to the mind to-night, "He was the only son
of his mother, and she was a widow."
It was a Sunday evening, and the lady sat at her quiet garden-window, reading the Bible; reading to herself, in a tremb14aTILE LADIES' READER.
ling voice, that very passage in it as I have heard him tell. He
heard the words, " Youngi man, I say lunlto thee, arise!"
He had to pass the window; and the bright dark eyes of
his debased time scemed to look at him. tIer heart told her
who he was; she camo to the door, quickly, and fell upon his
neck.
"He saved me from ruin, made me a human creature, won
me from infamy and shame. O God, for ever bless him! As
He will, He will!"
" He will!' the lady answered. " know he is in Heaven 1"
Then she piteously cried, "But, O, my darling boy, my darling
boy!'
Never, from the hour whlen Private Richard Doubledick enlisted at Chatlilam, had the Private, Corporal, Sergeant, Sergeant-Major, Ensign, or Lieultenant, breathed lis right name, or
the name of Mary Marshall, or a word of the story of his life,
into any ear, except his reclaimer's. That previous scene in his
existence was closed. IIe lad firmly resolved that his expiation
should be, to live unlknown; to disturb no more the peace that
had long grown over his old offences; to let it be revealed whlen
he was dead, that he had striven and suffered, and had never
forgotten; and then, if they could forgive him and believe him

But, that night, remcmbering the words he had cherished for
two years, "Tell her how we became friends. It will comfort
her, as it comforts me," he related everything. It gradually
seemed to him, as if in his maturity he had recovered a mother;
it gradually seemed to her, as if in her bereavement she had
found a son. During his stay in England, the quiet garden into which he had slowly and painfully crept, a stranger, became

that they would scarcely hold together. He stood beside them,
in an awful stillness of many men, shadowy through the mist
and drizzle of a wet June forenoon, on the field of Waterloo.
And down to that hour, the picture in his mind of the French
officer had never been compared with the reality.

vigor of life, broader across the chest and shoulders than he haa

in person. Travelling through all that extent of country after
three years of peace he blessed the better days on which the
world had fallen. The corn was golden, not drenched in unnatural red; was bound in sheaves for food, not trodden underfoot
by men in mortal fight. The smoke rose up from peaceful
hearths, not blazing ruins. The carts were laden with the fair
fruits of the earth, not with wounds and death. To him who
had so often seen the terrible reverse, these things were beautiful indeed, and they brought him in a softened spirit to the old
chateau near Aix, upon a deep blue evening.
It was a large chateau of the genuine old ghostly kind, with
round towers, and extinguishers and a high leaden roof, and

more windows than Aladdin's Palace. The lattice blinds were
all thrown open, after the heat of the day, and there were
glimpses of rambling walls and corridors within. Then, there
were immense outbuildings fitllen into partial dlecay, masses of
dark trees, terrace-gardens, balustrades; tanks of water, too
weak to play and too dilty to work; statues, weeds, and thickets of iron railing, that seemed to have overtgrown themselves
like the shrubberies, and to have branched out in all manner of
wild shapes. The entrance tloors stood open, as doors often do
in that country when the heat of the day is past; and the Captain saw no bell or knocker, and walked in.
Hie walked into a lofty stone hall, refreshingly cool and
gloomy after the glare of a southern day's travel. Extending
along the four sides of this hall, was a gallery, leading to suites
of rooms; and it was lighted from the top. Still, no bell was
to be seen.
"Faith," said tihe Captain, halting, asliamied of tlle clanking
of his boots, " this is a ghostlv beginning!"
Ile started back, and felt his face tlrn white. In the gallery, looking down at him, stood the French officer; the officer
whose picture he lihad carried in his mind so long and so far.
Compared with the origrinal, at last-in every lineanment how
like it was!
He moved, and disappeared, and Captain Richard Doubledick heard his steps coming quickly down into the hall. lIe

upon his face. Much such a look as it had worn in that fatal
moment.
Monsieur le Capitaine Riclhard Doubledick? Enchanted to
receive him! A thousand apologies! The servants were all
out in the air. There was a little fte among them in the garden. In effect, it was the fUte day of my daughter, the little
cherished and protected of Madame Taunton.
He was so gracious and so frank, that Monsieur le Capitaine
Richard Doubledick could not withhold his hand. "It is the
hand of a brave Englishman," said the French officer, retainiing
it while he spoke. "I could respect a brave Enlglishman, even
as mly foe; how much more as my friend I I, also, am a soldier."
" He has not remembered me, as I have remembered him;
he did not take such note of my face, that day, as I took of
his," thought Captain Richard Doubledick. " How shall I tell
him?"

The French officer conducted his guest inlto a garden, and
presented hinm to his wife; an engaging and Lealtiful woman,
sitting with Mrs. Taunton in a whimsical old-faslhioned pavilion.
His daughlter, her fair young face beamling with joy, came running to embrace him; and there was a boy-btaby to tumble
down among the orange-trces on the broad steps, in making for
his fatler's legs. A multitude of children-visitors were dancing
to sprightly music; antd all the servants andl peasants about the
chateau were dancing too. It was a scene of innocent happiness that might have been invenlted for the climiiax of the scenes
of peace which had soothed the Captain's journey.
He looked on, greatlv troubled in his mind, tluntil a resounding bell rang, andi the French officer begged to show him his
roomns. They went up stairs into the gallery from which the
officer had looked down; and Monsicur lc Capitaine Richard
Doubledick was cordially welcomied to a grand outer chamber,
anld a smaller one within, all clocks and draperies, and ihearths,
alnd brazen dogs, and tiles, and cool devices, and elegance, and
v ast Itnes.
"' You were at Waterloo," said the French officer.
"I was," said Captain Richard Doubledick. "And at l3adajos."
Left alone with the sound of his own stern voice in his ears,
he sat down to consider. What shall I do, and how shall I tell
him? At that time, unhappily, many deplorable duels had been
fought between English and French officers, arising out of the
recent war; and these duels, and how to avoid this officer's hospitality were the uppermost thought in Captain Richard Doubledick's mind.
He was thinking and letting the time run out in which he
should have dressed for dinner, when Mrs. Taunton spoke to
him outside the door, asking if he could give her the letter he
had brought from Mary. "His mother, above all," the Captain
thlought, "Iow shall I tell her?"
" YoQu will form a friendship with your host, I hope," said
Mrs. Taunton, whom he hurriedly admitted, "that will last for
life. He is so true-hearted and so geinerous, Richard, that you
can hardly fail to esteem one another. If he had been spared,"
she kissed (not without tears) the locket in which she wore his
hair, i he would have appreciated him with his own magnanimity, and would have been truly happy that the evil days were
past, which made such a man his enemy."
She left the room; and the Captain walked first to one win149INTRO D          UCT I ON.
THE PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
TnAT the study and practice of ELOCUTION sh110ould form a branch
in our systemsof Education, is now generally conceded. The true
metllod of conveying a knowledge of this art is, however, still open
to niuch discussion.
A very large class of intelligent and educated persons adopt the
radical opinions of Archbishop Whately, and, echoing his injunctions to students, say" Don't use any system of elocution: it oill give you afatse style;
but read and speak naturally, as if you understood and felt wohat
yo7u are reading and speaking. NATURE and HABIT will 8sho  you
how." While in direct opposition to this high authority we have
elaborated treatises on the Art, from popular Teachers, which insist
upon a perfect system of ARrIrICIAL training, by which the pupil is
reduced to a mere mechanical automaton, acted upon only by arbitrary and complicated Rules, and graduating every emotional expression of the voice by a scale of MUsICAL NOTATION. NoW, these
ultra views of the Art I conceive to be equally remote from a true
conception of the requirements necessary to form a natural, graceful, and impressive mode of delivery either in Reading or Speaking.
In my long experience as a Professor of this Art, I have never
found that NATURE, uneducated, untrained NATURE, ever made a
naturally correct reader, or an impressive and eloquent speaker. At
the same time I am free to confess that experience has confirmed me
in the opinion that elaborated AWrrtIIIAL rules are almost " worse
than useless," for they fetter all the natural impulses of the Pupil,
and too frequently substitute mannerisms and affectations for a
direct, earnest, natural method of delivery. And yet ELOCIUTIO
has itq rules, as essential and as neceseary to be understood andTtlE LADIES' READER.

" Spirit of my departed friend," said he, " is it through thee,

He sat down, with his head buried in his hands, and, when
he rose up, Inade the second strong resolution of his life: That
neither to the French officer, nor to the mlother of his departed
friend, nor to any soul while either of the two was living,

secretly forgave him in the name of the Divine Forgiver of injuries.

Hail to thee, blithe spirit!
Bird thou never wert,
That from heaven, or near it,
Pourest thy full heart
In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.
Iligher still and higher
From the earth thou springest
Like a cloud of fire;
The blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singet.
In thle golden lightning
Of the sunken sun,
O'er whichl clouds are brightening,
Thou dost float and run;
Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.
The pale purple even
Melts around thy ttlight;
Like a star of heaven
In the broad daylight
Thbou art untsn, but vet I hear tby shrill delight.

Soothing her love-laden
Soul in secret hour
Withl Ilusic sweet as love, which overflows her bower;
Like a glow-worm golden
In a dell of dew,
Scattering unbeholden
Its aerial hue
Among the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view:
Like a rose embower'd
In its own green leaves,
By warm winds deflower'd
Till the scent it gives
Makes faint with too much sweet these heavy winged thieves
Sound of vernal showers
On the twinkling grass,

Joyous, and clear and fresh, thy music doth surpua

In Egypt's centre, when the world wvts young,
My statue soar'd aloft -a man-shaped tower,
O'er hlundred-gated Thebes, by Iloniler sung,
And built by Apis' and Osiris' power.
WVhen the sun's infant eye more brightly blazed,
I mark'd the labors of unwearied time;
And saw, by patient centuries up-raised,
Stupendous teimples, obelisks sublime!
Ilewn from the rooted rock, some mightier mou1nd
Some new colo.sus more etnormnous springs,
So vast, so firm, that, as I gazed around.
I thought them, like myselt, eterial things.
Thea did I mark in sacerdotal state,
Psammis the king, whose alabaster tomb,
(Such the inscrutable decree:A o faite,)
Now floats athwart te sea to hare my doomll.
O Thebes, I cried, thou wonder of the world!
Still shalt thou soar, its everlastitng boast:
WVlhan lo I the Persian standards were unfilrl'd,
And fierce Cambyses led the invading host.
Where from the enst a dtst of cloud proceds,
A thousasnd bauner'd suns at once appear;.Noughlt else wis seen;-but sound of neighing steeds
And faint barbaric music met iinie car.
Onward they march, and foremost I descried
A cuirassed Grecian batnd in phalanx dense,
Around theml throng'd, in oriental pride,
Commingled tribes-a wild magniticence.
Dogs, cats, and monkers in their van they show,
WhichA Egypt's children worship and obey;
They fear to strike a sacrilegious blow,
And fall--a pious, unresisting prer.
Then havocy leaguing with infuriate zeal,
Palaces, temples, cities are o'erthrown;
Apis is stabb'd l-Cambyses thrusts the steel
And shuddering Egypt heaved a general groan I
The firm Memnonium mock'd their feeble power,
Flames round its granite columns hissd in vaii,
The head of Isis, frowning o'er each tower,
Look'd down with indestructible disdaiu.

Mine was a deeper and more quick disgrace:Beueatlh my shade a wondering army flock'd;
Witll force combined, they wrenclh'd me from my base,
And earth beueatl the dread concussion rock'd.
Nile from his banks receded with affright,
Thle startled Sphynx long trembled at the sound;
Whlile fromu each pyramid's astounded height,
The loosun'd stones slid rattling to the ground.
I watch'd, as in the dust supine I lay,
The fall of Thebes--as I had mark'd its fameTill curmbling down, as ages roll'd away,
Its site a lonely wildoriness Icame I
The throngs that choked its hlundred gates of yore,
Its fieets, its arnies, were no longer seen;
Its priestlood's ponlp, its Pharaohs were no moreAll-all were gone-as if they ne'er had been I
Deep was the silence now, unless some vast
And time-worn fragment thunder'd to its base;
Whose sullen echoes, o'er the desert cast,
Died in the distant solitude of space.
Or haply, in the palaces of kings,
Some stray jackal sate howling on the throne:
Or, on the temple's holiest altar, springs
Some gaunt hytnan, laughing all alone.
Nature o'erwhelms the relics left by time;By slow degrees entombing all the land;
She buries every monument sublime,
Beneath a mighty winding-sheet of sand.
Vain is each monarch's unremitting pains,
Wlho in the rock his place of burial delves;
Beholdl their proudest palaces and fCanes
Are subterraneous sepulchres theniselves.
Twenty-three centuries unmoved I lay,
And saw the tide of sand around me rise;
Quickly it threaten'd to engulf its prey,
And close in everlasting night mine eyes.
Snatch'd in this crisi. from my yawning grave,
Belzoni roll'd me to the banks of Nile,
And slowly heaving o'er the western wave,
This massy fragment reach'd the imperial isle.
In London, now with face erect I gaze
On England's pallid seas, whose eyes upeast,
View my colloal features with ariiaze,
And deeply ponlder on my glories past.

But who my future destiny shall guess?
Saint Paul's inay lie, like Memnon's temple, low.
London, like Thebes, may be a wilderuess,
And Thames, like Nile, through silent ruins flow.
Then haply may my travels be reuew'd:Some transatlantic hand may break my rest,
And bear me from Augusta's solitude,
To some new seat of empire in the west.
Mortal I since human grandeur ends in dust,
And proudest piles must crumble to decay;
Build up the tower of tlly final trust
In those blest realms-where naught shall pass sway!
TIHE DUbill WAITER.-FarEDERIC S. CozztEN.
WE have put a dumb waiter in our house. A dumb waiter
is a good thing to have in the country, on account of its conlvenlience. If you have company, everytling  cain be sent up
fromI the kitchen without any trouble, and, it the baby gets to
be lunbearable, on account of his teethl, you can dismiss the
colnplainant by stuffing him in one of the shelves, and letting
himil  down upon the help. To provide for contingencies, we
had all our floors deafened. In consequence, you cannot hear
anything that is going on in the story below; and, when you
are in atn upper room of the house, there might be a democratic
ratification mieeting in the cellar, and you would not know it.
Theretfre, if any one should break into the basement, it would
not disturb us; but to please Mrs. Sparrowgrass, 1 put stout
iron bars in all the lower windows.  Besides, Mrs. Sparrowgrass had bought a rattle when she was in Philadelphla; such
a rattle as watchmen carry there. This is to alarm our neighbor, who, upon the signal, is to come to the rescue with his revolver. He is a rash man, prone to pull trigger first, and make
inquiries afterward.
One evening, Mrs. S. had retired, and I was busy writing,
when it struck me a glass of ice-water would be palatable. So
I took the candle and a pitcher, anid went down to the pump.
Our piump is in the kitchen. A country pump, in the kitchen,
is more convenient; but a well with buckets is certainly most
picturesque.  Unfortunately, our well water has not been sweet
since it was cleaned out. First I had to open a bolted door

that lets vou illtto the basement-hall, and theti I went to tile
kitchen-door, wlichl proved to be locked. Then I renlembered
that our girl always carriedl the key to bed with her, and slept
with it under her pillow. Then I retraced miy steps; bolted
the basement door, and went up in the dining-room. As is
alwaiys tlle case, I foun(l, when I could not get any water, I was
thirstier thain I supposed I was. Then I thought I would wake
our~ girl up. Theni I concluded not to do it. Then I tlhought
of the well, bult I gave that up on account of its flavor.  Thenl I
opened the closet dloors, tlicre was no water there; and tlecn I
thought of the *ldumnb waiter!  The novelty of the idea made
mie smile; I took (llt two of the movable shelves, stood the
pitcher on the bottomn of the dumtnb waiter, got in myself with
thle lamp; let myselt down, until I supposed I was within a foot
of'he floor below, and then let go!
We came down so suddenly, that I was shot out of the apparatus as if it had been a catapult; it broke the pitcher, extinguished the lamip, an(l lanlded Ine in the middle of the kitchen
at midnight, with nio fire, and the air not Imuch above the zero
pwoint. The trlutll is, I had lmiscalculated the distance of the descent-instead of 1iflling one foot, I had fallen five. My first impulse was, to ascendl byv the way I came down, but I found tllat
imnpracticable. l'hen I tried the kitchen door, it was locke,l; I
tried to force it open; it was made of two-incll stlff, and held
its own. Then 1 lhoisted a winldow, and there were tihe rigid
iron bars. If I everC felt angry at anybody it was at mlly'slf, for
putting up those bals to please Mirs. Sparrowgra.ss. I put them
up, not to keep people in, but to keep pcople out.
I laid mly cheek against the ice-cold barriers and lookedl out
at the sky; not a star was visible; it was as black as ink overhead. Tflen I thought of Baron Trenck, and the prisoner of ChilIon. Then I made a noise! I shouted until I was hoarse, and
ruined our preserving-kettle with the poker. That brought our
dofrs out in fuill bark, and between us we made night hlideous.
Then I thought I heard a voice, and listened-it was Mirs.
Sparrowgrass calling to me from the top of the stair-case.  I
tried to make her hear me, but the infernal dog^s united with
howl, and growl, and bark, so as to drown my voice, wbich is
naturally plaintive and tender. Besides, there were two bolted
doors and double deafened floors between us; how could she
recognize my voice, even, if she did hear it?  Mrs. Sparrowgrass called once or twice, and then got frightened; the next
thing I heard was a sound as if the roof had fallen in, by whi. h

I understood that Mrs. Sparrowgrass was springing thle rattle!
Tblat called out our neigrlhbor, alretady wide awake; he came to
the rescue with a bull-terrier, a Newfoundland pup, a lantern,
and a revolver. The moment he saw lne at the window, he shot
at me, but fortunatelv just missed nme. I threw myself under
the kitchen table, and ventured to expostulate with him, but he
wotld not listen to reason. In the exciteient I had forgotten
his name, and that imtade matters worse. It was not until he
had roused up everybody around, broken in the basement door
with an axe, gotten into the kitchen with his cursed savage
dogs and shooting-iron, and seized me by the collar, that he
recognized ine--and then, he wanted me to explain it! But
what kind of an explanation could I make to him? I told hitm
he would have to wait until my mind was composed, and then
I would let himn understand the whole matter fully. But he
never would hnave had the particulars from me, for I do not ap
prove of neighbors that shoot at you, break in your door, and
treat you, in your own house, as if you were a jail-bird. He
knows all about it, however-somrebody has told him--somnebody tells everybody everything in our village.

Navza, perhaps, did any nian suffer death with more justice,
or deserve it less. The first step he took, after his capture, was
to write a letter to General Washington, conceived in terms of
dignity witllout insolence, and apology without meanness. The
scope of it was to vindicate himself from the imputation of having assumed a amean character for treacherous or interested purposes; asserting that he had been involuntarily an impostor;
that contrary to his intention, which was to meet a person for
intelligence on neutral ground, he had been betraved within
our posts, and forced into the vile condition of an enemy in disguise; soliciting only, that, to whatever rigor policy might devote him, a decency of treatment might be observed, due to a
person, who, thotgh unfortunate, had been guilty of nothing
dishonorable. His request was granted in its full extent; for,
in the whlole progress of the affair, he was treated with the
most scrupulous delicacy. When brought before the Board of
Oficers, lie met with every mlark of indulgence, and was re164TIlE LADIES' READIER.
quiredt to answer ino interrogatory which cotuld even embarrass
his feelings. O)n lhis part, while he caretilly concealed every
thing that mnliht involve  tlthers, he frankly confessied all the
facts relating to hilmself; and, upon his confession, without the
trouble of examining a witness, the board made their report.
The members of it were not more impressed with the candor
and firmness, mixed with a becoming sensibility, which he displayed, than he was penetrated witlh their liberality and politeness. Ie acknowledged the generosity of the behaviour toward
him in every respect, btut particularly in thlis, in the strongest
terms of manly gratitude. In a conversation with a gentleman
who visited himn after Ihis trial, he siaid he flattered himsielf he
had never been illiberal; but if there were auy remains of prejudice in his mind, his present experience must obliterate them.
In one of the visits I made to himin, (and I saw him several
times durintg his confinement,) he begged nme to be the bearer
of a request to the general, for permission to send an opeti letter to Sir Henry Clinton. " I foresee my fate," said he, " and
though I pretend not to play the hero, or to be indifferent
about life, yet I am reconciled to whatever may happen, conscious that misfortune, not guilt, has brought it upon me.
There is only one thing that disturbs my tranquillity. Sir
Henry Clinton has been too good to me; he has been lavish of
his kindness. I am bound to him bv too many obligations, and
love him too well, to bear the thought that he should reproach
himself or that others should reproach him, on the supposition
of my having conceived myself obliged, by his instructions, to
run the risk I did. I would not, for the world, leave a sting in
his mind that should imbitter his future days."  He could
scarce finish the sentence, bursting into tears in spite of his efforts to suppress them; and with difficulty collected himself
enough afterward to add: "I wish to be permitted to assure
him, I did not act uuder this impression, but submitted to a necessity imposed upon me, as contrary to my own inclination as
to his orders." His request was readily complied with; and he
wrote the letter annexed, with which I dare say you will be as
much pleased as I am, both for the diction and sentiment
When his sentence was announced to him, he remarked, that
since it was his lot to die, there was still a choice in the mode,
which would make a material difference in his feelings; and he
would be happy, if possible, to be indulged with a professional
death. He made a second application, by letter, in concise bu'
persuasive terms. It was thought this indulgence, being incom

patible with the customs of war, couldl not be granted; and it
was therefore determninetd, in both cases, to evade an answer, to
spare him the sensations which a certtlin knowledge of the intended mlode would inflict.
In going to the place of execution, lihe bowed finmiliarly, as
he went along, to all those with whomi he lad been acquainted
in his confinement. A smxile of complacency expressed tile
serene fortitude of his mind. Arriived at thle fittal spot, he
asked, with otme emotion, " Mtust I thllc die in this manner?"
He was told it lhad been unavoidable. " I am reconciled to imy
ftate," said he, "' but not to the mod(e."  Soon, however, recoilectingl himself, he added: " It will be but a momentary pang;'
and, springing upon the cart, performed the last offices to hIunself, with a composure that excited the atdmliration atnd melted
tlhe lhe.arts of the beholders. Upon being t.dl ttle final monlment
was at hand, and asked if he had an-vthlin to say, he answered,
"Nothing, bult to requelst you will;itness to tile worll, that I

Thelre was something singtnlarly interestinf in the character
andI fortunes of Andre. To an excellent understanding, well iimproved by education and travel, he united a peculiar elegance
of mind and manners, and the advantage of a pleasing person.'Tis said he possessed a pretty taste for tie fine arts, and had
himnself attained some proficiency in poetry, music, and painting. tlis knowledge appeared without ostentation, and emnbellished by a diffidence thlat rarely accompanies so many talents
alld accomplishments; whicli left vou to suppose imore than
ap)'cared. His setntiments were elervated, and inspired esteem:
they had a sofness that conciliated affection.  His elocution
was handsome; his address easy, polite, and insinuating. By
his merit, he had acquired the tnlimirited confidence of his general, and was mnakilng a rapid progress in military rank and
reputation.  But in tile height of his career, flushed with new
hopes froim the execution of a project, the mlost beneficial to his
party that could be devised, he, was at once precipitated from
the summinit of prosperity, and saw all the expectations of his
ambition blasted, and hitnself ruinetd.
Thle character I have given of him is drawn partly from what
I saw of himun mrayself, and partly from information. I am aware

Rush'd headlong to tile sea.
Alono stood brave Horatius,
But constant still in mintd;
Thrice thirty thousand foes before,
And the broad flood behind.
" Down with him I " cried false Sextus,
With a smile on his pale face.
"Now yield thee," cried Lars Porsena,
"Now yield thee to our grace."
Round turn'd he, as not deigning
Those craven ranks to see;
Nanught spake he to Lars Porsenn,
To Sextus naught spake he;
But he saw on Palatinus
Tlhe white porch of his home;
And he spake to the noble river
That rolls by the towers of Itome.
0 O Tiber I father Tiber I
To whom the Romanls pray,
A Roman's life, a Roman's arms,
Tatke thou in charge this day I "
So lihe spake, and speaking sheathed
The good sword by his side,
And, withl his harness on his back,
Plunged headlong in the tide.
No sound of joy or sorrow
Was hleard fromm either bank;
But friends and foes in dtumb surprise,
Witlh parted lips and straining eyes,
Stood gazing where he sank:
And when above the surges
They saw his crest appear,
All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,
And even the ranks of TuscanyIy
Could scarce forbear to cheer.
But fiercely ran the current,
Swollen high by months of rain;
And fast his blood was flowing;
And he was sore in pain,
And heavy with Ihis trmour,
And spent with changing blows;
And oft they thought him sinking,
But still againl i rose.

Now round him throng the fathers

When the goodman mends his armour,
And trims his helmet's plume;
When the goodwife's shuttle merrily

With weeping and with laughter
Still is the story told,
How well Horatius kept the bridge

TILE SEN'SE OF BEAUTYT-Cas2iNIxo.
BEAUTY is an all-pervading presence.  It unfolds in the num
berless flowers of the spring.  It waves in the branches ot the
trees and the green blades of grass.  It haunts the depths of
the earth and sea, and gleams out in the htles of the shell and
the precious stone. And not only these minute objects, but
the ocean, the mountains, the clouds, the heavens, the stars, the
rising and setting sun, all overflow with beauty.  The universe
is its temple; and those men who are alive to it, cannot lift
their eves without feeling themselves encompassed with it on
every side.  Now, this beauty is so precious, the enjoyments it
gives are so refined and pure, so congenial with our tenderest
and noble feelings, and so akin to worship, that it is painfil to
think of the multitude of men as living in the midst of it, and
living almost as blind to it as if, instead of this fair earth and
glorious sky, they were tenants of a dungeon.   An infinite joy
is bl,at to the world by the want of culture of this spiritlual enduwuntent.  Suppose that I were to visit a cottage, a;:d to see

its walls linedl *with the choicest pictures of Raphael, and every
spare nook filled with statues of the most exquisite workmanship, and that I were to learn that neither man, woman, nor
child ever cast an eve at these miracles of art, how should I feel
their privation; how should I watlt to open their eyes, and to
help themI  to comprehend and feel the loveline  and grandeur
which in vain courted their notice!  13ut every husbandiman is
living in sight of the works of a diviner Artist; and how much
would his existence be elevated, could he see the glory which
shines forith in their formis, hues, proportions, and moral expression I I have spoken only of the beauty of nature, but how
nluch of this mysterious cliarm is found in the elegant arts, and
especially in literature?  Th'e best books have most beauty.
The greatest truthls are wronged if lnot linked with beauty, and
they win their way Imost surely anld deeply into the soul when
arrayed in this their natural aind fit attire.  Now, no man receives the true culture of a man, in whiom the sensibility to the
beautiful is not cherished; an(d I know of no condition in life
froam which it should be exclulded.  Of all luxuries this is the
cheapest and most at at hand; nnd it seems to ime to be most ilnportant to those conditions, *whe re  coarse labor tends to give a
grossness to the mind.    Fromi the diffusion of the sense of
beauty in ancient Greece, and of the taste for music in modern
Germany, we learn that the people at large maynv partake of refined gratifications, whicl h have Iitherto bcen thought to be necessarly restricted to a few.

THB TIRGINIAN 0UXTLIEANS.--Jomn P. Kz(sDxt.
FaAN,K MrIWETInER is now in the meridian of life; somewhere close upon forty-five. Good cheer and a good temper
both tell well upon him. The first has given him a comfortable
full figure, and the latter certain easy, contemplative liabits,
that incline hilmn to be lazv attnd philosoiphical. He has the substantial planter look that belongs to a gentlemnian who lives on
his estate, and is not mnuch vexed with the crosses of life.
I thiink he prides himself on his personal appearance, for he
has a handsome face, with a dark bilue eve, and a lhighl forchead
that is scaintily embellished with solie silver-tipped locks thlat,
I observe, he cherishes for their rarity; besides, he is growing
manifestly attentive to his dress, and carries himiself erect, wvithl
some secret consciousness that his pvlrson is not bad. It is
pleasant to see him when he has ordet.rcd his horse for a ride
into the neighborhood, or across to the court-house. On such
occasions, he is apt to make his appearance in a coat of blue
broadcloth, astonishingly new and glossy, and with a redundant
supply of plaited ruffle strutting through the folds of a Marseilles
waistcoat; a worshipful finishl is given to this costume by a
large straw hat, lined with green silk.  There is a miagisterial
fulness in his garments that betokens condition in the world,
and a heavy bunch of seals, suspended by a chain of g,old,
jingles as he moves, pronouncing hitn a man of superfluities.
It is considered rather extraodirnarv that he has never set
up for Congress; but the truth is, lie is an unambitious nan,
and has a great dislike to currying favor-as lie calls it. And,
besides, he is thoroughly convinced that there Aill always be
men enough in Virginia, willing to serve the people, and the.refore does not see why he should trouble his head about it.
Some vears ago, however, there was really an impression that
he meant to come out. By some sudden whimn, he took it into
his head to visit ~ashington during the session of Congress,
and returned, after a fortnight, very seriously distempered with
politica  He told curious anecdotes of certain secret intrigues
which had been discovered in the affairs of the capital, gave a
pretty clear insight into the views of some deep-laid combinations, and becatm e, all at on1e, painfully florid in his discourse,
and dogmatical to a degree that ntade his wife stare. Fortunately, this orgasm soon subsided, and Frank relapsed into ai

indolent gentleman of the opposition; but it had the effect to
give a ilucll more decided caist to hiis studies, f,r lhe forthwith
discarded tlhe Whig and took to the Enlquirer, like a itiman who
was not to be disturbed by doubts; and as it was morally ilmpossible to believe what was written ont both sides, to preveIlt
his milnd firom being abused, he, froim this time forward, gave
an implicit assenlt to all the ftlcts that set against Mr. Adams.
The consequence of this straightforward and conifiding deportmeniit wail an uns olicited land compliinentary notice Jo him l by

of the peace, andl, having tlilts beco1me a public mIan against his
will, hlis opiiiios were o,bserved to undergo some essential
changes. Ile I1now thinks thlat a good citizen ought neither to
solicit nor decline office; that the magistracy of Virginia is thle
sturdiest pillar that supports thle fabric of the constitution; and
that the people, " tllough in their opinions they mitay be mistaken, in their isentiments tlhey are never wrong"--with some
other such d,gmias, that, a few years ago, he did not hold in
very good repuite.  In this temlper, he has, of late, embarked
tupon the mnill-pond of county affairs, and, notwitlstanding Iiis
amiable andl respectful republicanism, I am told he keeps thle
peace as if lie c ommanded a garison, and administers justice
ike a ciadi.                                           jutice
He has:so,ne claim to supremacy in this last department;
for, during three yeatrs of his life, he smoked cigars in a lawyer's
office at Richmlond; sometimes looked inito lBlackstone and the
Revised Code; was a member of a debating society that ate
oysters once a week during the winter; and wore six cravats
and a pair of yellow-topped boots as a blood of the metropolis.
Having in this way qualified himself for the pursuits of agriculture, he came to his estate a very model of landed gentlemen.
Since that time, his avocations have had a certain literary tincture; for, having settled himself down as a married man, and
got rid of his superfluotls foppery, he rambled with wonderful
assiduity through a wilderness of romances, poems, and dissertations, whlich are now collected in his library, and, with their
battered blue covers, present a lively type of an army of continentals at the close of the war, or an hospital of veteran invalids.
These have all, at last, given way to the newspapers--a miscellaneous study very enticing to gentlemen in the country-that
have rendered -Meriwether a most diseomfiting antagonist in the

A VISION OF TIIE VATICAN.-FRAxcSs AssN KrMBLL.
In the great palace halls, where dwell the gods
I hea:rd a voice filling the vaulted roof;
The lhe;rt that uttered it seem'd sorrow proof,
And, clarion-like, it might lhave made tlhe clods
Of thle dead valley stalrt to sudden life,
With such a vigor and a joy'twas rife.
And, coming towards me, lo a wotsna past,
lter fitc was shining as the morning bright,
Alld her feet fell in steps so strolgr and light,
I scarce could tell if she trode slow or fitst:
Shle seem'd instinct with beauty and with power,
And what slle sang dwells with me to this hour.
"Transfigur'd from the gods' abode I come,
I have been tarrying in their awful hotne;
Statnld from my path, and give me pas.ige free,
For yet I breathe of their divinity.
Jove h ave I knelt to, solemn and  eretne,
And stntely tIerS, heaven's transcndtl ant quecnll;
Apollo's ligiht is on my brow, and fleet,
As silver-sandall'd Dian's are my feet;

Anid PIalla.s, steadfstly leholding me,
Ilathl.set me forth in - wisdom to be free."
When at the portal, smiling she did turn,
An:d, lrcking back thro' the vast halls profound,
Re-echoing with her s$ong's triumphant )aund,
She tow'd her head, and siid.--" I shall return!"
Thlen raised her face, all radiant with deliglht,

HIAGAR IN TIlE WIItDERNEi-.-- I. P. WLLts.
The morning broke. Light stole upon the clouds
With a strange beauty. Earth received again
Its garment of a thousand dves; and leaves,
And delicate blossom., and the painted flowers
And everything that bendeth to the ddew,
And stirreth with the daylight, lifted lp
Its beautty to the breath of that sweet morn.
185THE LADIES' READER.
All things are dark to sorrow; and the light
And loveliness, and fragrant air were sad
To the dejected Hagar. The moLst earth
Was pouring odors from its spicy pores,
And the young birds were singing as if life
Were a new thing to them; but olh I it came
Upon her heart like discord, and she felt
How cruelly it tries a broken heart,
To see a mirth in aVr tlhing it loves.
She stood at Abraham's tent. Her lips were press'd
Till the blood started; and the wandering veins
Of her transparent forehead were swell'd out,
As if her pride would burst thoem. Her dark eye
Was clear and tearless, and the light of heaven,
Which made its language legible, shot back,
From her long lashes, as it had been flame.
Her noble boy stood by her, with his band
Clasp'd in lher own, and his round delicate feet,
Scarce train'd to balance ol the tented floor.
Sandall'd for journeying. lHe had look'd up
Into his mother's face until hlie caught
The spirit there, and his youIng heart was swelling
Beneath hlis dimpled bosom, and his form
Straighlten'd up proudlv in liis tiny wratll,
As if lhis light proportions would have swell'd,
lIad they but match'd his spirit, to the mant.
Whqly bends the patriarch, as he cometh now
Upon his staff so wearily?  H9is beard
Is low upon his breast, anlld his high brow,
So written with the converse  of his God,
Bearetll the swollen vein of agony.
His lip is quivering, and his wonted step
Of vigor is not tlere; and, tlhough the morn
Is passing fair and beautiful, he breathes
Its freshness as it were a pestilence.
Oh l ma n may bear witlh suffering; his heart
Is a strong thing, and godlike, in the grasp
Of pain that wrings mortality; but tear
One chord affection clings to-part one tie
That binds him to a woman's delicate loveAnd his great spirit yieldleth like a reed.
He gave to her the water and the bread
But spoke no word, and trusted not himself
To look upon her face, but laid his lland
In silent blessing on the fair-bair'd boy,
And left her to her lot of loneliness.
Should llagar weep? May slightes  woman turn
And, as a vine the oak hath shaken off;
Bend lightly to her leaing trust again t?
O no! biy all her loveliness-by all

O)NE of tlle illost atnllsitg anid actate persons I remembertand in mlv very early )days 1 knew hiln wtll-wkts      a whlitelheaded, lamie old man, knownII in the  neighlborllood   of Killaggin, by the name of Burnt Eagle, or, as the Irislh pea;sants
catlled himn, "'Burnt Aigle."  tIis descent proclaimed him     an
Irisihman, buit some of his habits were not characteristic of
the countrv, for he understood the value     of money, and that
which makes money-Time.           He certainlv was not of the
neighborhood in which he resided, for he had no " people," no
uncles, aunts, or cousins.    What his real name was I never
hleard; but I remelimber himL since I was a verv little girl, just
old enough to be placed by m       nurse on the back of Burnt
Eagle's donkey.   At that time he lived in a neat, pretty little
cott'ge, about a mile from our house: it containedl two roomlls;
they were not only clean bitt well furnished; tllat is to sav,
weil filrnished for an Irish cottage.
188THE LADIES' READER.
The little patch of ground this inldustrious old man had, aft,er
incredible labor, suc cceded in forminig over the coat of sward
that covered the sand, was in front of Crab Hlall.  The donkl;y
had done Ihis best to assist a master who had never given hinl
an unjust blow: the fence was forinmed round the little inclosure of grav granite, which some convulsion of nature had strewedc
abundantly on the strand; these stones the donkey drew   up
when his day's work was ended, three or four at a time. Evenl
this inclosure was perfected, and a very neat qate of basket-work
with a latch outside andl. a bolt in, hung opposite the cottage
door, before Burnt Eagle lhlad laid down either the earth or mianure on his plot of ground.
"   hy, thin, B3urnt Aigle, dear," said Mrs. Radford, the netmIaker's wife, as, followed by seven lazy, dirty, healthy children,
she strolled over the sand-hills one evening to see whiat the poor
boche r* was doing., at the place, " that was good enoughl for Corney, the eralh)-catcher, withIout alteration dacent man! for twenty,c'ars.  Whly, thin, Bulrrnt Aigle, dear, what are ye slaving and

" Whl     I thought I toldl e, Mrs. Radford, wlien I tauglht ye

to thliink of that  how the Lord helps us to a great deal, if we
only do a little toward it!"
"Ilow do you make that out?" inquired the net-maker.
liBurnt Eagle puilled a seed-pod froim a tuft of beautifuil seapink.  " All that's wanted of ius, " he said, " is to put such as
this in the earth at first, and doesn't God's goodness do all the
rest?"
"Bult it would be' time enough,' sure, to make the fence
whin the groiund was ready," said his neighlbor, reverting to the
first part of hler conversation.
"And have all the neilghbors' pigs right through it the next
morning'l" retortved tihe old man laughing; "no, no, that's not
my way, Mrs. Radford."
"Fair and aisy goes far in a day, Masther Aigle," said the
gossip, lounging against the fence, and taking her pipe out of
her pocket.
"Do you want a coal for your pipe, ma'am I" inquired Burnt
Aigle.

souls of iljfinite ages anld of uncoulnte(d worlds! Let a nloment's failure of his power, of his watchfllness, or of his will to
do good, occur, anld whast a sweep of death aind annihilati,,l
through the universe! Ilow stars would reel, pltanets expire,
and nations perish' B ut from age to age uo such catastropllphe
occurs, evenI in the midst of national crimes, and of atheisin
that denies the hand that made and feeds it: life springs with
a power ever nlew, food springs up as plentifully to sustain it,
and sunshine and joy are poured over all from the invisible
throne of God, as the poetry of the existenuce he has given.  It'
there come seasons of dearth or of failure, they comle but as
warnings to proud and tvrannic mnan. The potato is smitten,
that a nation mav not be oppressed for ever; and the lartvest is
diminished, that the laws of mali's untlnatural avarice may be
rent asunder.  And then again the sun shines the rain falls,
and the earth rejoices in a renewed beauty, and in a redoubled
plenty.
It is amid one of these crises that we at this moment stand,
and hail the month of harvests with unmingled joy. Never
did the finger of God demonstrate his beneficent will more perspicuolusly than at this moment. The nations have been warned
and rebluked, anld again the bounty of heaven overflow~ the earth
in golden billows of the ocean of abundance. God wills that all
the arts of man to check his bounty, to create scarcity, to establish dearness, to enfeeble the hand of the laborer, and curse the
table of the poor, shall be put to shame. That his creatures
shall eat and be glad, whether corn-dealers and speculators live
or die.
I1 4THE LADIES' READER1
Nations, therefore, have fittingly rejoiced in every century
since tile creation in the joyfulness of harvest. It has been a
time of activity and of songs. Never was there a generation
that had more cause to put forth their reaping and rejoicing
hanlds and sing so heartily as ours. The coming month will
see the I'laraoh of monstrous monopoly, and all his wretched
selfish hosts, drowned in tle lte(l Sea of abundance. The corn
dealers will be smothered in the showering-down heaps of their
own comlnodity; the speculator who has so long sought his
owin fatteningf at tlhi cost of a nation's starvation and misery,
shall find that tllhere is a greater speculator in the blue serene
above him, whose lhalnd catl whelm him in the gulf of his own
schemes, and craze all the chariot wheels of his cunning. Praise
to God-the God of harvests-and to Hiln whose cattle are on
a thousand hills. Let tus go oult and rejoice amid the sulnshine,
and the wheat stooping to the sickle, and the barley to the
scythe, and in the certain asslurlance that the loaf never was
cheaper than it shlll be witlinl the next six months, never the
heart of labor mnore strengtlhDened with abundance.
There is no month more beautiful than Augrust. It has a serene splendor and imaturity abolt it that is delightful. The soil
is dry, the skyv is bright and beautifuil, with scattered and silvery
clouds. The ftoliage is full and luxuriant-the grass fields mnown
in Julle and July are now full of the richest green, and cattle wanrider in finest condition through themn, or lie in groups
arolund worthy of a painter's hand. There is a sort of second
spring in trees, the oak and thle elm, especially, puttifrg forth
new shoots of a lighter tint. The hedges put on the same vernal lookintg linle, and the heather on the moors, and sweet scalbiutses, bl1ue chicory, the large whlite convolvulus, hawkweeds,
hloneysuckles, and the slnall blue campanula, make the fields
gay. Tle nuts, still green, hang in prodigal clusters on the tall
old hedt,es of old woodland lanes. Young frogs in thousands
are issuing from the waters, and traversing the roads; and birds
having terminated their spring cares, are out enjoying their
families in the sunny and plentiful fields

DESCRIPTION OP A DUTCH VILLAGK--D. G. MITCBELL
A HALF-lIOUH'S sail brought us in sight of the church spire,
rising froln among the trees; and soon appeared the chimneytops, and finally the houses themselves, of the little town of
Brock-all prettily reflected in a clear side-basin of the canal.
A towIn it hardly is; bhut a group of houses among rich trees,
whlere eight hundred neighbors live, and make things so neat,
that strangers come a thousand imiles for a look at the wondrous nicety. Passing by the basin of smooth water that reflected so prettily the church and the trees, we stopped before
a little inn, finely shaded with a beech trained into an arbor all
over the front. A very, very pretty blue-eyed Dutch girl of
sixteen, received me. We could talk nothing together; but
there happened a stupid old Meinheer smoking with his wife at
the door, througlh lwhom I explained my wants.
I saw by the twinkle in her eye that she comprehended. If
I had spo ien an hour it could not have been better-my dinner. There were cutlets white as the driven snow, and wine
with cobwebs of at least a vear's date on the bottle, and the
nicest of Dutch cheese, and strawberries, and profusion of delicioIus cream.
The blue-eyed girl had stolen out to put on another dress,
while I was busy with the first cutlet; and she wore one of the
prettiest little handkerchiefs imaginable on her shoulders, and
she glided about the table so noiselessly, so charmingly, and
arraniged the dishes so neatly, and put so heaping a plateful of
strawverries before me, that-confound me! I should have
kept by the dinner-table until night, if the old lady had not put
her head in the door, to say--there was a person without who
would guide ne through the village.
" And who is to be my guide?" said I, as well as I could
say it.
The old lady pointed opposite. I thought she misunderstood
me, and asked her again.
She pointed the same way-it was a stout woman with a baby
in her arms!
Was there ever such a Cicerone before I I looked incredulously at my hostess; she looked ame honestly enough back, and
set her arms a-kimbo. I tried to understand her to point to
her blue-eyed daughter, who was giggling behind her shoulder
-but she was inexorable.
108TIUE LADIES' READER.
I grew frightened; the woman was well enough, though jogging upon torty.  But the baby--what on earthl should it be
doing; suppose she were to put it in my arms in soime retired
part of the village? Only fancy me six leagues from Amsterd(am, with only ten guilders in my pocket, and a fat Dutch
baby squalling in my hands! But the woman-with a ripe,
red, latighing cheek, had a charitable eye, and we set off together.
Not a bit, though, could we talk, and it was nicAts, nichts,
however I put the (questions. Nature designed eyes to talk half
a language, and the good soul pleaded to mc with hers for the
beauty of her village-words of the oldest Cicerone could not
plead stronger. And as for the village it needed none. It was
like dreanming; it was like a fairy land.
Away, over a little bridge we turned off the towpathl of the
canal, and directly were in the quiet ways of thi town. They
were all paved with pebbles or bricks, arranged in every quaint
variety of pattern; and all so clean, that I could find no place
to knock the ashes fromn my pipe. The  rass tllhat grew up
everywhere to the edge of the walks was saort-not the prim
shlortness of French shearing, but it had a look of dwarfish
neatness, as if custom had habituated it to short growth, and
lhabit become nature. All this in the public highway-not
five yards wide, but under so strict municipal surveillance, that
no horse or unclean thing was allowed to trample on its neatness. Once a little donkey, harnessed to a miniature carriage,
passed us, in which was a Dutch Miss, to whom my lady patroness with the baby bowed low. It was evidently, however, a
privileged lady, and the donkey's feet had been waxed.
Little vards were before the houses, and these stocked with
all sorts of flowers, arranged in all sorts of forms, and so cleanwalks, beds, and flowers-that I am sure, a passing sparrow
could not have trimmed his feathers in the plat, without bringing out a toddling Dutch wife with her broom. The fences
were absolutely- polished with paint; and the hedges were
clipped-not with shears, but scissors. Now and then faces
would peep out of the windows, but in general the curtains
were close drawn. We saw no men, but one or two old gardeners and a half-a-dozen painters. Girls we met, who would
pass a word to my entertainer, and a glance to me, and a low
courtesy, and would chuckle the baby under the chin, and
glance again. But they were not better dressed, nor prettier,
thia the rest of the world, besides having a great deal shorter

llolcielike.
Little boys were rolling along home from school-rolling, I
mean, as a seaman rolls-with their short legs, and fat bodies,
and phlegmatic faces. Two of them were throwing off hook
and bait into the canal from under the trees; and good fishers,
I dare stay, they made, for never a word did they speak; and I
almost fancied that if I had stepped quietly up, and kicked one
of thenl into the water, the other would have quietly pulled in
his line-taken off his bait-put all in his pocket, and toddled
off in true Dutch style, home, to tell his Dutch inainma.
Round pretty angles that came unlooked for, and the shady
square of the churcli-not a sound anywhere-we passed along,
the womnan, the baby, and I. Half a dozen timles, I wanted
Cameron with me to enjoy a good Scotch laugh at the oddity
(of the whole thing; for there was sometling approaching the
ludicrous in the excess of cleanliness-to say notlhing about nai

colfirmdec the idea with which the extravagant neatness can
inot fitil to impress one, that the whole thing is a nmockery, and
in no sent e eIarinest.
Front this we wandered away in a new quarter, to the tubs,
annd pans, and presses of the dairy. The wonman in waiting gave
a suspicious glaXne. at miv feet when I entered the cow-stable;
and afterward, when she favored me with a look into her home,
all beset witlh hil-polishled cupboards and china, my steps

Tn, big imastiff who turned the churn was sleeping under the
table, and tile Imaid showed mete the women milking over the
low ditches in the fields,-for the sun *w^as getting near to tl.e
far away flat grounds in the west.
With another stroll through the clean streets of the village, I
returned to my little intn, where I sat under the braided limbs
of the beech-tree over the door. There was something in the
quiet and cleanliness thlat impressed me like a picture, or a curious book. It did not seem as if healthy flesh and hlood, with'TIlIC LADII'.:~' Ii'EA1I)ER.THE LADIES' READER.

living.  I am   sure that some of the dirty people alotng the
Rhone, alld in the Vallais Canton of Switzerland, if suddenly
translated to the grass slopes that sink into the water at Broek,
would imagine it some new creation.
So I sat there musing before the inn, looking olut over the
clanal, and the vast plain with its feeding flocks, and over the
groups of cottages, alnd windmills, and far-off delicate spires.

MR. MINNYS AND HIS COUSIN.-DIcxztsMai. AtCoGUSTUS M1I.Ns was a bachelor, of about folrty, as he
said-uf about eight-and-forty, as his friends said.  He was alvayvs exceedingly clean, precise, and tidy; perhaps somewhat
priggish, and the most retiring man in thie world.   He usually
wo1'c a brown frock-coat without a writnkle, a neat neckerchief
withl a remarkably neat tie, and boots without a fault; moreover, lhe always carried a brown silk umbrella with an ivory
handle.  lie was a clerk in Somterset-house, or, as he said hinmselt, he hlelid "a responsible situation under Government."  He
had a good and increasing salary, in addition to some ~10,000
of his own (invested in the funids), and he occupied a first-floor
in Tavistock Street, Covent Garden, where he had resided for
twenty years, having been in the habit of quarrelling with his
landlord the whole tnme, regularly giving notice of hiis intention
to quit on the first day of everv quarter, and as rularly counterinanding it on the second.  There were two clntes of created
objects wlich he held in the deepest and most unmingled horror; tlley were, dogs and children.  He was not unamiable, but
he could at anyl time have viewed the execution of a dog or the
asaesination of an infant, with thie liveliest satisfaction.  Their
habits were at variance with his love of order; and his love of
204THE LADIES' READER.
order was as powerful as his love of life. Mr. Augustus Minns
had no relations, in or near London, with the exception of his
cousin, Mr. Octavius Buddcn, to whose son, whom he had never
seen (for he disliked the father) he had consented to become
godfather, by proxy. Mr. Buddenl having realized a moderate
fortune by exercising the trade or calling of a corn-chandler,
and having a great predilection for the country, had purchased
a cottage in the vicinity of Stamford Hill, whither he retired,
with the wife of his bosom, and his only son, Master Alexander
Augu.stu.s Budden. One evening, as Mr. and Mrs. B. were admiring their son, discussing his various inerits, talking over his
education, and (lisputing vllether the classics should be made
an essential part thereof, tile lady pressed so strongly upon her
husband the propriety of cultivating the friendship of Mr. Minns
in behalf of their son, that Mr. Bldden at last made up his
nind, that it should not be his fault if lie and his cousin were
not, in future, more intimate.
"1I'll break the ice, my love," said Mr. Budden, " by asking
Miiins down to dine with us, on Sunday."
"Then, prav, Mr. Butdden, write to your cousin at once," replied Mrs. Budden. " Who knows, if we could only get him
down here, but that he might take a fancyv to our Alexander,
and leave him his property?-Alick, my dear, take your legs
off the rail of the chair!"
"Very true," said Mr. Budden, musing, "very true, indeed,
my love'"
On the following morning, as Mr. Minns was sitting at his
breakfast-table, alternately biting his dry toast, and casting a
look upon the colutnns of his morning paper, which he always
read from the title to the printer's name, he heard a loud knock
at the street-door, which was, shortly afterwards, followed by
the entrance of his servant, who put into his hand a particularly
small card, on which was engraved, in immense letters, "Mr.
Octavius Budden, Amelia Cottage (Mrs. B.'s name was Amelia),
Poplar W\alk, Stamford Hill."
" Budden," ejaculated Minns, " what the deuce can bring that
vulgar fellow here---say I'm asleep-say I'm out, and shall
never be home again-any thing to keep him down stairs."
"But please, sir, the gentleman's coming up," replied the
servant; and the fact was made perfectly evident, by an appallinr creaking of boots on the staircase, accompanied by a patt~rinw noise, the cause of which Minns could not, for the life of
Ihim, divine.

shaggy dog, dressed in a suit of fleecy hosiery, with pink eves,
large ears, and no perceptible tail.
The cause of the pattering on the stairs was but too plain.
Mr. Augustus Mitnns staggered beneatll the shock of the dog's
appearance.' "My dear fellow, how are you?" said Budden as he entered.
IIe always spoke at the top of his voice, and always said the
samne thing half-a-dozen times.
"How are you, my hearty?"
" Iow do you do, Mr. Budden,--pray take a chair "' politely
stammered the discomrfited Minns.
"Thank you-thank you--well-how are you, eh?"
"Uncomtnonly well, thank re," said Minnus, casting a look at
the dog, who, with his hind-les og l the floor, and his fore-paws
resting on the table, was dragging a bit of bread-alkl-bultter out
of a plate, preparatory to devouring it, with the buttered sidle
next the carpet.
" Ah, you rogue I" said Budden to his dog; "you see, Minns,
he's like me, always at homne, eh, my boy?-Egad, I'm preciouls
hot and hungry!I've walked all the way fromu Stamford lfill
this morning."
" IHave you breakfasted?" itinquired  linns.

Minns rang the bell, and tried to smile.
"I decidedly never was so hot in my life," continued Octavius, wiping his forehead; "well, how are you, Minns?'Pon

"D'ye think so I" said Minns; and he tried another smile.
"'Pon my life, I do!"
"Mrs. B. and-what's his name-quite well?"
"Alick-my son, you mean, never better-never better. But
at such a place as we've got at Poplar Walk, you know, he
couldn't be ill if he tried. When I first saw it, by Jove! it
looked so knowing, with the front garden, and the green irailings, and the brass knocker, and all that-I really thoulghlt it
was a cut above me."
"Don't you think you'd like thle ham better." interrupted
206THE LADLES' READEPR.
Mfinns, "if vou cut it the other wayv" IIe saw, with feelings
wlhich it is impossible to describe, that his visitor was cutting
or rather mainiing the liham, in utter violation to all established
rules.
"No, thaink ve," returne(l B13dden, with the most barbarous
indifference to crime, "I prefer it in this way-it eats short.

will be delighted with the place; I know you will. Amelia
and I were talking about you the other nighlt, and Amelia said
-another lump of sugar, please; thank ye--she said, don't you
think you could contrive, my dear, to say to Mr. Minns, in a
friendly way--come down, sir-tle dog! lie's spoiling your
curtains, Mlinns-ha!-ha-hha!"  Minns leaped fr(om his seat
as though he had received the discharge from a galvanic
battery.
"Come ouit, sir!-go out, hoo!" cried poor Augustus, keeping, nevertheless, at a very respectful distance froln the dog,
rhavingr read of a ease of hydrophobia in the paper of that morning. By dint of great exertiotn, mnuch shouting, and a imarvellous deal of poking under the tables with a stick and timbrt.lla,
the dog was at last dislodged, and placed on the landitlg, outside the door, where he immediately commenced a most appalling howling; at the same time vehemently scratching the paint
off the two nicelv-varnished bottom panels of the door, until
they resembled the interior of a Ibackgammlon-board.
"A good dog for tile country that!" coolly observed Budden
to the distracted Minnu--" he's not much used to confinement,
though. But now,'Minns, when will you come down?   I'll
take no denial, positively. Let's see, to-day's Thursday.--Will
you come on Sunday? We dine at five, don't say nro-do."
After a great deal of pressing, Mr. Augustus Alinns, driven to
despair, accepted the invitation, and promised to be at Poplar
Walk on the ensuing Sunday, at a quarter before five to the
minute.
"Now mind the direction," said Budden; "the coach goes
from the Flowerpot, in Bishopsgate Street, every half hour.
When the coach stops at the Swan, you'll see, immediately opposite you, a white house."
"Which is your house-I understand," said Minns, wishing
to cut short the visit and the story at the same time.
"No, no, that's not mine; that's Grogus's the great ironmonger's. I wrs going to say-you turn down by the side of
the white house till you can't go another step further-mind
2 I28THE LADIES' READER.
that--and then you turnr to vour right, by some stables-well;
close to you, you'll see a wall with' Beware of the Dog' written
upon it in large letters-(Minns shuddered)-go along by the
side of that wall for about a quarter of a mile, an4 any body
will slow you wllich is lmy place."
" Very well-thank ye-good bye."
"Be punctual."
"Certainl; good morning."
"I say, Miinns, you've got a c~ard?"
"Yes, I have; thank vre."  And Mr. Octavius Buddeln departed, leavintg his cousin looking forward to his visit of the
ollowing Sunlday, with the feelinrt  of a penniless poet to the
weekly visit of his Scotch lan(dlady.
Sunday arrived; the sky was bright and clear; crowds of
people were hlurrying along the streets, intent on their different
schemes of pleasure for the day; and every thing and every body
looked cheertifl and happy bult Mr. Aulllstus Minns.
The day was fine, hut the hebat was considerable; and by the
time Mr. Minns hnad flged up the shady side of Fleet Street,
Cheapside, and Threadneedle Strceet, he had become pretty
warm, tolerably duisty, and it was getting late into the bargain.
By the most extraordinary good fortune, however, a coach was
waiting at the Flowerpot, into whllich Mr. Augustus Minns got,
on the solemn assurance of the cad that the vehicle would start
in three minutes-that being the very utmost extremity of time
it was allowed to wait by Act of Parliament. A quarter of an
hour elapsed, and there were no signs of moving. Minns looked
at his watch for the sixth timte.
"Coachman, are you going, or not?" bawled Mr. Minns, with
his bead and half his body out of the coach-window.
"Di--rectly, sir," said the coachman, with his hands in his
pockets, looking as much unlike a man in a hurry as possible.
Five minutes more elapsed; at the end of which time the
coachman mounted the box, fromll whence he looked down the
street and up the street, and hailed all the pedestrians for another five nminutes.
"Coachman! if you don't go this moment, I shall get out,"
said Mr. Minns, rendered desperate by the lateness of the hour;
and the impossibility of being in Poplar Walk at the appointed
tinle.
" Goingthis minute, sir," was the reply and accordingly the
machine trundled on for a couple of hundred yards, and then
stopped aain. NMinns doulbled himself up into a corner of the
208TtIE LADIES' READER.,(o:l)l, l and a,batloned himself to fiate, as a child,:a mlotlher, a
banbllox, and a parasol became his feill,w-passengers.
Tlhe child was an affectionate and ant amiable inlfialt; the
little dear mistook Minns for its other parent, and screamed to

B" IBe quiet, dear," said the mamma, restraining the illlpett)sitv of the darling, whose little fat legs were kicking and stamlling,, and twining themselves into the most complicattd forms,
in an ecstasy of impatience.  "I1e quliet, dear, that's inot youlr

of plesaure he had exi eriened that morning shone like a meteor

W\'lell thle unlforttunate gentleman  arrived at the swan, he
foulll to his great dismnay, that it was a quarter past five. The
wlhite hloute, tlhe stables, the "I:eware of the DoJ"--every
lanldmark was passed, witlh a rapidlity llot iunusual to a gentlemalln of a ccrtidn age when too late for dinner.  After tle lapse
of a few minutes, Mr. Minns fourtd hlimself opposite fa yellow
brick house with a greell door, bras.s knocker and door- plate,
green window frames and ditto railings, withl "a gardeln" in
front.  His knock at the door was answered by a stumpl y boy,
in drab livery, cotton stockings and high-lows, wlio, after hanging his hat on one of the (lozen brass pegs whichl ornamented
the passage, denominated by coulrtesy "The IIall," usahered him
into a front drawing-rooim commanding a very extensive view
of the backs of the neighboring houses. The ustll ceremotny

somlehow or other, the Lion of about a dozen people, sitting togetlher in a smtall drawting-room, getting rid of that most tedious

from extending his gallantry any farther. Th. dinner passed
off as such dinners usulally (do. Ever and anon amidst tile clatter of knives and forks, and the hum of conversation, Mr. B.'s
voice might be heard, asking a friend to take wile, and assuring himn he was glad to see'im; and a great deal of by-play
took place between Mrs. B. and the servants, respecting the
removal of the dishes, during which her countenatnce assunmed
all the variations of a weather-glass, from "stormy" to "setfair."
Upon the dessert and wine being placed on the table, the
servant, in compliance with a significant look fromn Mrs. B.
brought down "Master Alexander," habited in a sky-blue suit
with silver buttons, and with hair of nearly the saime color as
the metal.  After sundry praises from his mother, and various
admonitions as to his behaviour from his Pa, he was introduced
to his godfather.
"Well, my little fellow-you are a fine boy, ain't you?" said
Mr. Minns, as happy as a tomtit on birdlime.
"Yes:,
"How old are you?"
"Eight, next We'nsday. Ilow old are you?"
"Alexander," interrupted his mother, "how dare you ask
Mr. Miuns how old he is!"," He asked me how old I was," said the precocious child, to
whom Minns had from that moment internallv resolved he
never would bequeath one shilling. As soon as the titter occasioned by the observation had slubsided, a little smirking man
with red whiskers, sitting at the bottom of the table, who dur
ing the whole of dinner had been endeavoring to obtain a listener to some stories about Sheridan, called out, with a very
patronising air-" Alick, what part of speech is be e"
"A verb."
"That's a good bov," said Mrs. Budden with all a mother's

"A verb is a word which signifies to be, to do, or to suffer;
as, I an--I rule-I amn ruled. Give me an apple, Ma."
4I'11 give you an apple," replied the man with the red
whiskers, who was an established friend of the family, or in
other words, was always invited by irs. Budden, whether Mr.

of be."

"No, dear," frowned Mrs. Budden. " 13B double E is the sub.

"I don't tlinkl; he k;nows much yet about con1mou, substalltives," said the smirking gentleman, who thought this all admirable opportunity for letting off a joke. " It's clear lie's not
very M ell acquainted with proper natne. Ile! he! he!"
"Gentlemien," called out Mr. Budden, froin the end of the
table, in a stentorian voice, and witlh a very important air,
"will you have the goodiness to charge your glasses?  I have a
toast to propose."
"Hear! hear!" cried the gentlemen, passing the decanters.
After they liad imade the round of the table, Mr. Budden proceeded--" Gentlemen; there is an individual present-"
"i Ilear! hear!" said the little man with red whiskers.
"Pray be quiet, Jones," remonstrated Budden.
"I say, gentlelmIen, tlhere is an itidividual present," resumed
the host, "in whose society, I am sure we must take great delight-and-and-the conversation of that individual must have
afforded to every one present, the utmost pleasure. Gentlemen,
I am but a humible individual myself, and I perhaps ought to
apologise f. r allowing any individual feelings of friendship and
affection for the person I allude to, to induce me to venture to
rise, to propose the health of that person-a person that I atlm
sure-that is to say, a person whose virtues must endear him to
those who know him-and those who have not the pleasure of
knowing him, cannot dislike him."
"Hear! hearl" said the company, in a tone of encouragement and approval.
"Gentlemen," continued Buldden, " my cousin is a man who

groaned audilbly. "Who I am most happy to see here, and
who, if he were not here, would certainly have deprived us of

hear.) Gentlemen, I feel that I have already trespassed on

All eyes were now fixed on the subject of the toast, who by
gulping down port wine at the imminent hazard of suffocation,
endeavored to conceal his confusion. After as long a pause as
decency would admit, he rose, but, as the newspapers some211THE LADIES' READER.

to give even the substance of the honorable gentleman's observations." The words "present comnpany--honor-present occasion," and "great happiness"-heard occasionally, and repeated
at intervals, with a cou,ntenance expressive of the utmost confusion and misery, convinced the cotmpany that he was making
an excellent speech; and1 accordingly, on his resuming his seat,
they cried "Bravo!" alnd manifested tumultuous applause.
Jotles, who had been long watching his opportunity, then
darted up.
"Budden," said he, " will you allow me to propose a toast I"
"Certainly," replied 13udlden.
"It has on several occasions, in various instances, under
many circumstances, and in ditffretnt companies, fallen to lmy
lot to propose a toast to those by whom, at the time, I have
had the honor to be surrounded. I have sometimes, I will
cheerfully own-for why shouldl  I deny it?-felt the overwhelming nature of the task I have undertaken, and my own
utter incapability to do justice to the subject. If such have
been my feelings, however, on former occasions, what must
they be now--tow--under the extraordinary circumstances in
which I am placed. (Ilear! hIear!)  To describe imy fielin-s
accurately would be impossible; but I cannot give you a better

Now, there is no knowing what new villainy in tbe form of a
joke would have been heaped ulpon the memory of that very
ill-used man, MAr. Sherida)n, if the boy in drab had not at that
mnoment entered the roon in a breathless state, to report that,
as it was a very wet night, the nine o'clock stage had come
round to know whether there was anybody going to town, as,
in that case, he (the nine o'clock) had room for one inside.
Mr. Minns started up; and, despite countless exclamations
of surprise, and entreaties to stay, persisted in his determination to accept the vacant place. But the brown silk umbrella
was nowhere to be found; and as the coachman couldn't wait,
he drove back to the Swan, leaving word for Mr. Minns to
"run round" and catch himl. But as it did not occur to Mr.
Minns for some ten minutes or so, that he had left the brown
silk umbrella with the ivory handle in the other coach, coming
down; and, moreover, as he was by no means remarkable for

I loved the Winter once with all rmy soul,
And longed for snow-storms, hail and mantled skies;
And sang their praises in as gay a troll
As Troubadours have poured to Beauty's eyes.
I deemed the hard, black frost a pleasant tlhing,
For logs blazed higlh, and horses' hoofs rung out;
Andl wild birds came with tame and gentle wing
To eat the bread my young hland flung about.
But I have walked into the world since then,
And seen the bitter work that cold can doWhere the grim Ice King levels babes and men
With bloodless spear, that pierces through and through.
I know now, there are those who) sink and lie
Upon a stone bed at the dead of night,
I know the roofless and unfed mt4st ldie,
When even lips at Plenty's feast turn white.
And now whene'er I hear the cuckoo's song
In budding woods, I bless the joyous comer;
While my heart runs a cadence itl a throng
Of hopeful notes, that say-" Thank God for Sumwrl'I've learnt that sunslhine bringeth more than flowers,
And fruits, and forest leaves to cheer the earth;
For I have seen sad spirits, like dark bowers,
Light up beneatlh it with a gratefu; mirth.
The aged limbs that quiver in their task,
Of dragging life on, when the north winds goad--
Taste once again contentment, as they bask
In the straight b:ains that warm their churchyard road.

The meek-eyed morn appeam mother of dews,
At first faint gleaming in the dappled east;
Till far o'er ether spreads the widening glow;
And, from before the lustre of her face,
White break the clouds away. With quickened step
Brown Night retires: young Day pours in apace,
And opens all the lawny prospect wide.
The dripping rock, the imountain's misty top,
Swell on the sight, and brighten with the dawn.
Blue through the dusk, thile smoking currents shline;
And from the bladed field the fearful hare
LiAmps awkward; while along the forest glade
The wild deer trip, and often, turning, gaze
At early passenger. Music awakes
The native voic of undis.nembled joy;
And thick around the woodland bymns arise.
Roused by the cock, the soon-clad shepherd leaves
His mossy cottage, where with Peace he dwellsAnd from the crowded fold, in order, drives
His flock, to taste the verdtue of theo morn.
Falsely luxurious will not Man awake;
Alnd, springing from the bed of sloth, enjoy
The cool, the fragrant, and the silent hour,
To meditation due and sacred song?,For is their aught in sleep can charm the wise?
To lie in dead oblivion, losing half
The fleeting moments of too short a life---
Total extinction of the enlightened soul!
Or else to feverish vanity alive,
Wildered and tossing thirough distempered dreams?

N. B.-By continuous practice on the foregoing elementary sounds
of letters, with reference to their itnportance in Elocutionary expression-that is, the development of the pure vocal tone in their
pronunciation-Pupils would be insensibly led into a correct klnowledge, and a finished execution of what have been designated Tonic
andI Subtonio Sounds, without being distracted by the elaborated
rules and tables of examples, deemed essential by those who are
advocates for coinplicated artificial rules. To further aid Pulils of
matured capabilities, I annex a Table of Tonics, Subtonics, and
Atonics, as arranged by Dr. Rush, and which are generally adopted
by Professors of ETocution.
But all the essential principles of Articulated Sounds may be
evolved in the examples I lhave before given. The exercise on thle
following Tables may be fouund advantageous in developing and
strengthening the vocal organs, if the practice is made to involve
the prolonged sounds of the vowels and vocal consonants-- with a
full expulsion of the chest tones, and with varied mnodtulations of the
voice.
TONICS.
Tonics are elementary sounds, which have a distinct and perfect
tone proper to themselves, and capable of being held or prolongeil
by the voice indefiniitely. They are--A, E, I, 0, U, as heard in

VALLEY OF MEXICO.--\ILLux II. PatEScoTT.
TiiE troopl, refreshed by a nliglt's rest, succe-eded, early on
the tollowillng lay, in gaining the crest of the sierra of Ahualco,
which streticlies like a curtain }letweell the two great mountains
oni the north and south. Their progress was now comlparatively easy, tand they marched forward with a buoyant step as
they felt they were treading the soil of Montezuna.
Ti'iley had not advanced far, when, turning an antgle of the
siterra, they suddenly came on a view whichl Ilore than conmpensated the toils of the preceding day. It was that of the
tValley of Mexico, or Tenochtitlan, as more com2nmlllyl called by
tlhe natives; which, with its picturesque  ssetnrl,la,ge of water,
woodland,, and cultivated plains, its shiniing cities iaind shadowy
hills, wal spread out like sonic gay and gorgeous panoramal before
theml. In the higlllv rarefied atmnospllere of these upper regions,
eveCn remlote objects have a brillianev of coloring and a distinctIetss of outline whicll seem to annihilate distance.  Stretching
thr away at their feet were seen noble forests of oak-, sycamore,
and cedar, an,l beyond, yellow fields of mlaize and the towering magucy, intermingled witll orchards and blooming gardens;
t;r flowers, in stch demand for their religious festivals, were
icvcn Iore abundant in this populous valley than in other parts
of Anahuac.  In the centre of the great basin were beheld the
lakes, occupying then a much larger portion of its surface than
at present; their borders thickly studded with towtns anld hamulets, and, in thle midst-like somle Indian empress with her coronial of petrls-the fair city of Mexico, witll her white towers
atnd pyramidal temples, reposing, as it were, on the bosom  of
thle waters, te far-fallled "Venice of the Aztecs."  Hiugh over
all rose the royal hill of Chapoltepec, the residence of tile NMexican monarchs crowned with the samiie grove of gigantic cypresses, whicl at this day flingr theitr broad shadows over the
land. In the distance beytond the blue waters of the lake, and
Ilearly screened by iuterveniing foliage, was seen a shining
peck, the rival capital of Tezeuco, and, still fartier on, the dark
belt of porphyry, girdling the Valley around like a rich setitng which nature had devised for the fairest of her jewels.
Such was the beautiful visibn which broke on the eves of the
conquerors. And even now, when so sad a cbhange has come,evtr the scene; when the statelv forests have beenl laid low,

and the soil, unsheltered from the fierce radiance of a tropical
sun, is in many places abandoned to sterility; when the waters
have retired, leaving a broad and ghastly margin lwhite withl
the incrustation of salts, wlhile tlhe cities and haimlets on their
borders have mnouldered into ruins; even n0ow that desolatioii
broods over the aindscape, so indestructible are the lines of
beautty wlich nature has traced on its features, that no traveler,
however cold, can gaze on them with any other emotions than
those of astonishmIent and rapture.
What, tlien, must have been the emotions of the Spaniards,
when, after wvorking their toilsome way into the ulpper air, the
cloudy tabernacle parted before their eyes, aind tihey beheld
these fair scenes in all their pristine magnificence and beauty!
It was lik  the spectacle whlich greeted the eyes of Moses from
the sumllmit of Pisgall, and, in the warm  Llow of their feelings,
tlhey cried out, " It is the promised land!'

PUDLDIPORD AND ITS PEOPLXI--IL E Rmzr.
THE township of Puddleford was located in the far west,
and was, and is unknown, I presume, to a large portion of my
readers. It has never been considered of sufficient importance
by atlas-makers to be designated by them; and yet inen, women,
and children live and die in Pulddlefo,rd. Its poptulation helps
make up the census of the United States every ten years; it
helps make governors,- congress-men, presidents. Puddleford
does, and fails to do, a great many things, just like the'rest of
mankind,' and yet, who knows and cares anything about Puddleford I
Puddleford was well enough as a township of land, and beautifull was its scenery. It was spotted with bright, clear lakes,
reflecting the trees that stooped over them; awtd straight through
its centre flowed a majestic river, guarded by hills on either
side. The village of Puddleford (there was a village of Puddleford, too) stood huddled in a gorge that opened up from the
river; and through it, day and night, a little brook ran tinkling along, making music around the' settlement.' The houses
in Puddleford were very sahabbv indeed; I am very sorry to be
compelled to mnake that fact public, but they were very shabby.
Some were built of logs, and some of boards, and some were
never exactly built at all, but came together through a combination of circumstances which the " oldest inhabitant" has never
been able to explain. The log-houses were just like log-houses
in every place else; for no person has yet been found with impudence enough to suggest an improvement. A pile of logs,
laid up and packed in mud; a mammloth fire-place, with a
chimney-throat as large; a lower story and a garret, connected
in one corner by a ladder, called "Jacob's ladder," are its essentials. A very few ambitious persons in Puddleford had, it
is true, attempted to build frame-houses, but there was never
one entirely finished yet. Some of them had erected a frame
only, when, their purses having failed, the enterprise was left
at the mercy of the storms. Others had covered their frames;
and n,e citizen, old Squire Longbow, had actually finished off
two rooms;4and this, in connection with the olffice of justice
of the peace, gave him a standing and influence in the settlement almost omnipotent.
The reader discovers, of course, that Puddleford was a very
226THE LADIES READER.
miscellaneous-looking place. It appeared tnfinished, and ever
likely to be. It did really seem that the houses, and cabins,
and sheds, and pig-sties, had been sown up and down the
gorge, as their owners sowed wheat. The only harmony about
the place was the harmony of confusion.
Pud(ldkford had a population made up of all sorts of people,
who had been, from a variety of causes, thrown together just
there; and every person owned a number of dogs, so that it
was very difficult to determinle which were numerically the
strongest, the inhabitallts or the dogs.  There were great
droves of cows owned, too, which were in the habit of congregating every morning, and marching some miles to a distant
marsll to feed to the jingle of the bells they wore on their necks.
Puddlleford was not destitute of a church, not by any means.
The " log chapel," when I first became acquainted with the
place, was an ancient building. It was erected at a period
almost as early as the tavern--not qulite-temporal wants
pressing the early settlers closer than spiritual.
This, reader, is a skeleton view of Pud3leford, as it existed
when I first knew it. Just out of this village, some time during the last ten years, I took possession of a large tract of
land, called "bulrr-oak openillg," that is, a wide, sweeping
plain, thinly clad with burr-oaks. Few sights in nature are
more beautiful. The eye roams over these parks unobstructed
by undergrowth, the trees above, and the sleeping shadows on
the grass below.
The first time I looked upon this future home of mine, It
lay calm and bright, bathed in the warm sun of a May morning, and filled with birds. The buds were just breaking into
leaf, and the air was sweet with the wild-wood fragrance of
spring. Piles of mosses, soft as velvet, were scattered about.
Wild violets, grouped in clusters, the white and red lupin, the
mountain pink, and thousands of other tiny flowers, bright as
sparks of fire, mingled in confusion.  It was alive with birds;
the brown thrasher, the robin, the blue jay poured forth their
music to the very top of their lungs.'he thrasher, with his
brown dress and very quizzical look, absolutely revelled in a
luxury of melody. He mocked all the birds about him. Now
he was as good a blue-jay as blue-jay himself, and screamed as
loud; but suddenly bouncing around on a limb, and slowly
stretchling out his wings, he died away in a most pathetic
strain; then, darting into another tree, and turning his saucy
eye inquisitively down, he rattled off a chorus or two, that I

night know lie was not so sad a fellow after all. Now, his
soft, flute-like notes fairly melted in his throat; then he drew
out a long violin strain, the whole length of his bow; then a
blast on his trumipet roused all the birds. lie was " everytlhing
by turns, and nothing long."  After completing his performance, away lie went, and his place, in a moment almost, was
occupied by another, repeating the medley, for the whole wood
was alive with them.
Scores of blue-jays, in the tops of the trees, were picking
away at the tender buds. Tile robin, that household bird, first
loved by our children, was also here. Sitting alone and apart,
in a reverie, and blowing occasionally his mellow pipe, he
seemed to exist only for his own comfort, and to forget that he
was one of the choristers of the wood. Woodpeckers wer2
flitting hither and thither; troops of quails whistled in the
distance; the oriole streamed out his bright light through the
green branches; there was a winnowing of wings, a dashing
of leaves, as birds came rushing in and out. It was their festival.
Reader, such was the scene presented to my eve the day I
first looked upon the piece of wild land upon which I finally
settled and improved. I had just arrived from an Eastern village, where I was born, and "brought up," as the phrase is.
A somewhat broken fortune, and breaking health had driven
me frot it, with a moderate family, to seek a spot elsewhere;
and I resolved to try the Great West, that paradise (if the word
of people who never saw it, is to be taken) where the surplus
popuilation of a portion of the world have fotlnd a home.
The chatnge was great. Btut great as it was, I resolved'to
endure it. So at it I went. I procured " help," girdled the
trees, put a breaking team of twelve yoke of cattle on the
ground, tore it up, fenced the land, raised a log-house, and in
the fall I had a crop of wheat growing, the withered oak-trees
standing guard over it. My family, consistitng of a wife and
three children, a boy of eight, and two giris of twelve and
teni, were removed to their new qularters, and I had thus fairly
begun the world again, anid all tlings were as new about me as
if I had just benu born into it.
During the summer, I had an opportunity of studving the
general character of the inhabitants of Puddleford, and its surrounding country population. Like most Western settlements,
it was made up of all kinds of materials, all sorts of folks,
holding every opinion. More than a dozen States had contri228THE LADIES' READER.
buted to make up its people. Society was exceedingly,niscellanecous. Tle keen YIalnkkee, the obstinate Pennsylvaniinll, iand
the reckless Soutllherner were there.  Each one of these persons had brought along with hlimi his early habits, anld associations-his own views of business, law and religion. When
thrown together on public questions, this composition boiled
up like a mixture of salts and sola. Factions, of course, were
formed amnong those, whose early education and habits were
congenial; divisions were created, and a war of prejudice and
opinion went on fi'oin monthl to I)lloith, and year to year. The
New-Englallld Yallkec stood aboult ten years aheadl of the Pennsylvania German, in all Ihis ideas of progress, while the latter stood
back dogged andl sullen, attachlled to the customus of his fathers.
Anotlher general feature consisted in this, that there was no permanency to society. The inhabitants were constantly changing,
pouring out anld inl, like the waters of a river; so that a co&gt;lmplete
revolution took place every four or five years. Every body who
remained in Puddleford expected to remove somewliere else very
soon. They were merely sojourners, not residents. Thlere was
no attachment to, or veneration for the past of Puddlleford, because Puddleford had no past. The ties of Inemory reached to
older States. There stood the church that sheltered( the infant
years of Puddleford's population, and there swung the bell that
tolled their fathers and fathers' fathers to the tolib. There
was the long line of graves, running back a hundred years,
where the sister of yesterday, and the ancestor whose virtues
were only known through tradlition, were buried. There tottered the old homestead which had passed through the family
for generations, filled with heir-looms that had become sacred.
The school-house was there, where the village boys shouted
together. Lookingr back from a new country, where all is confusion, to an old one, where figures have the stability of a
painting, objects which were once trivial, start out upon the
canvas in bolder relief.  The venerable, gray-headed pastor,
who appeared regularly in the village pulpit for half a century,
to impart the word of life, rises in the memory, and stands
fixed there like a statue. The quaint cut of his coat, the neat
tie of his neck-cloth, the spectacles resting on the tip of his
nose, his hums idi haws, his eye of reproof, his gestures of
vengeance, are now living things-are preaching still. We
see again the changing crowd, that year after year went in and
out of that holy place; the spot where the old deacon sat, his
head resting on a pillar, his tranquil face turned upwatl, his

recollect the gay bridal, the solemln tuneral, the buoyant falce
of the one, the still, cold one of the other. NWe even remenllber the lamne old sexton, who rang the bell, and went limping
up to the burying ground, with a spade upon his shoulder.
Even he, of no consequence when seen every day, is transformed by distance, and mellowed by memory into a real being. And then there are the hills and streams, and waterfalls,
that shed their music through our boyish souls, until they
became a part of our very existence.  No man ever lived who
entirely forgot these things, suppressed though they miglt be,
by the cares and anxieties of maturer yearls. And no circumstance so likely to bring them all up, glowing afresh, as a removal to a new country. Of course, no one was attached to
Puddleford, as a locality, atny more than the wandering Arab
is attached to the particular spot where he pitches his tent and
feeds his camnels.
But I will not go into particulars with the Puddlefordians at
present. During the summer, my acquaintance with Venison
Styles had ripened into a deeper affection for the old hunter.
I accepted his invitation to *visit him, and found him sheltered
in the depths of the forest, and nestled in a valley, his hut
overshadowed by great trees, which were filled with birds
pouring forth their songs. A little brook tinkled down the
slope by his hut, singing all kinds of woodland tunes, as the
breeze swelled and died along its banks. The squirrels were
chatting their nonsense, and the rolling drum of the partridge
was heard almost at his very door.
Venison was a hunter, a fisher, and a trapper. The inside
walls of his cabin were hung about with rifles, shot-guns, and
fishing rods, which had been accumulating for years. Deerhorns aand skins lay scattered here and there, the trophies of
the chase. Seines for lakes, and scoop-nets for smaller streamy
were drying outside upon the trees.
Venison kept around him a brood of lazy, lounging, good
for-nothing boys, of all ages, about half-clothed, who followed
the business of their father. This youing stock were growing
up as he had grown, to occupy somlewhere thejF father's position, and lead his life. They'lived just as welhs the hounds
for all stbood on an equalitv in the fthily.  These ragamufflns
were perfect lmasters of natural history.  There. was not an instinct or peculiarity belonging to the denizens of the woods

seemed to have penetrated the secrecy of animal life, and
fathorned it throlughout.  Birds, and beasts, and fish were completely within their power; and there was a kind of matter-ofcourse success with them in their capture that was absolutely
provoking to a civilized hunter.

Old Tubal Cain was a man of might,
In the days when earth was young;
By the fierce red light of his furnace bright,
The strokes of his hammer rung;
And he lifted high his brawny hand
On the iron glowing clear,
Till the sparks rnlh'd out in scarlet showers,
As he fashiou'd the sword and spear.
And he sang-," Hurrah for my handiwork!
Hurrah for the spear and sword  
Hurrah for the hand that shall wield them well,
For he shall be king and lord I"
To Tubal Cain came many a one,
As he wrought by his roaring fire,
And each one pray'd for a strong steel blade,
As the crown of his desire;
And he made them weapons sharp and strong,
Till they shouted loud for glee,
And gave him gifts of pearls and gold,
AnDd spoils of the forest free.
And they sang--" Hurrah for Tubal Cain,
Who hath given us sr-ength anew I
Hurrah for the smith, hurrah for the fire,
And hurrah for the metal rue I"
But a sudden change came o'er his heart.
Ere tile setting of the sun;
And Tubal Cain was fill'd with pain
For the evil be had done;
He saw that men, with rage and hate,
Made war upon their kind,
That the land was red with the blood they shed,
In their lust for carnage blind.
And he said-"Alas! that I ever made,
Or that skill of mine should plan,
The spear and the sword, for men whose joy
Is to slay their fellow-man!"

And bared his stroing right arm for work,
While the quick flames mounted high.
And he sang--" Hurrah for my handiwork I"
And the red sparks lit the air;
"Not alone for the blade was tile bright steel made,"
And he fashiou'd the first ploughshare.
And men, taught wisdom from the past,
In friendship join'd their hlands,
Hung the sword in the hall, the spear on the wall,

what might be termed "a goodly companv."
It is no longer the custom in American packet-ships for ladies
to persevere in what is called a sea-dress-that is, a sort of dishlabille prepared expressly for the voyage. Those who are not
well enough to devote some little time and attention to their
personal appearance, rarely come to the general table, but take
their meals in their own apartment. The gentlemen, also, pay
ais munich respect to their toilet as when on shore.

Ou(r passengerl  were not too nuel!ron'. T'Ih  lesser cabin
was appropriated to thlree other ladies 1and myself.
Our fourth female passenger was Mrs. Cumminilgs, a plump,
rosv-fiaed o1(1 lalv of remarlably lilnitcd ideas, who hlad literally passed her whole life in the city of London. IHaving been
recently left a widow, shlie lhad broken up housekeeping, andr
w.as now on her way to join a soon established in New York;,
who had very kindly sent for lher to colme over and live witli
hinm. The rest of tlle worldl w: alllost a sealed book to her,
but she talked a rgreat deal of the Minories, the Poultry, tilhe Old
Jewry, Clleapside, Lolln Acre, Bisoplsgrtec Within and;Bishopsgate Witthout, and othel streets and places with anpellations
equally exprlessive.
The majority of the male pas:,sengers were pleasant and compauionable--and we thought wc hadcl seen them all in the course
of thle first three days-lbut o,l tlie fourth, we hear(d tlhe captain
say to one of the waiters, "J Itba, ask that gentlenman if I shall
have th Ipleasure of taking wine with hilm."  My cyes now involuntarily followed the directiont of Juba's movements, feeling
so1me curio,sity to know who 1" that getntleman" was, as I now
recollected having frequently heard the epithet within the last
few days. For instance, when almost every one was confined
by sea-sickness to their state-roomns, I had seen the captain
despatch a servant to inquire of tthat gentleman if he would have
any thing sent to him from the table. Also, I had heard Hnmnilton, the steward, call out--" There, boys, don't you hear that
gentleman ring his bell-why don't you run spontaneouslyjump, one of you, to number eleventeen."  I was puzzled for a
molient to divine which state-room bore the designation of
eleventeen, but concluded it to be one of the many unmeaning
termus that characterize the phraseology' of our colored people.
Once or twice, I wondered who that gentleman could be; but
something else happened immediately to divert my attention.
Now, when I heard Captainl Santlow propose taking wine with
him, I concluded, that, of course, that gentleman must be visible
in propria persona, and casting nly eyes toward the lower end
of the table, I perceived a genteel-looking man whom I had not
seen before. He was apparently of no particular age, and there
was nothin g in his face that could lead any one to guess at his
countrv. He might have been English, Scotch, Irishl or American; but he had none of the characteristic marks of either
nation. He filled lli.s glass, and bowing his head to Captain
Santlow, who congratulated him on his recovery, he swallowed

his wine in silence. There was an anitlated conversation going
on near the head of the talle, between Miss Audlev and two
of her beaux, and we thought no mnore of himn.
At ttle close of the dessert, we happened to knrow that he had
quitted the table and gone on deck, by one of the waiters conming down, and requesting Mr. Overslaugh to let him pas for a
momenlt, while lie went into No. cleventeen for that gentlemal's
overcoat. I n1ow found that the servants had converted No. 13
into elevenlteen. By-the-bye, that gentleman had a state-room
all to himself, sometimes occupying the upper and sometimes
the under birth.
"Captain Santlow," said Mr. Fenton, "allow me to ask you
the namne of that gentleman."
"Oh! I don't know," replied the captain, trying to suppress
a smile, " at least I have forgotten it--some English name; for
he is an Englishman-he came on board at iPlrmouth, and his
indisposition commenced immnlediately. Mrs. Cummings, shall
I have the pleasture of peeling an oran:ge for you?"
I Inow recollected a little incident whiiclh lhad set me laughing
soon after we left Plymouth, and when we were beating down
the coast of Devonshire. I had been trving to write at the
table in the ladies' cabin, but it was one of those days when
"Our paper, pen and ink, and we
Roll up and down our ships at sea."
And all I could do was to take refilge in my berth, and endeavor to read, leaving the door open for light and air. Mv attention, however, was continually withdrawn froml my book. by the
sound of something that was dislodged from its place, sliding or
falling, and frequently sutffering destruction; though sometimes
miraculously escaping unlhurt.
While I was watching the progress of two pitchers that had
been tossed out of the washing-stand, and after deluging the
floor with water, had met in the ladies cabin, and were rolling
amicably side by side, without happening to break each other,
I saw a barrel of flour start from the steward's pantry, and running across the dining-room, stop at a gentleman that lay extended in a lower berth with his room door open, and pour out
its contents upon him, completely enveloping him in a fog of
meal. I heard the steward, who was busily engaged in mopping up the water that had flowed fromli the pitchers, call out,
" Run, bovs, run, that gentleman's smothering up in flour-go
take the barrel off him-jump, I tell you."

ITow that genltlemain acted while hididen in tile cloud of flour,
I couild inot percei\ve, anld immediately tile closinlg of the folding
doors shut out tlle scene.
For a few dayvs after lie appeared among us, there was some
speculalstiol with relard to thil naleless stranger, whose taciturnity seemiied lhis cllief characteristic. One iimorning while we
were looking at the galmbols of a slhoal of porpoises that were
tumbling through the waves and sometilnes leaping out of thenm,
my lhis:band mlade so,le remark on the clumlsy antics of this
unsihlltl fi,ll, addressing hillself, for tile first tilme, to the unknown En,glishllllan, who happened to be sttand(ing near him.
That gentlemanll smiled affably, but made no reply. MIr. Fenton
ursutld thle subject-ltanc d that gentleman smiled still nlore affaly, and walked away.
Nevertheles,, he was neither deaf nor dumb, nor melancholy,
but had oinly "a great talent for silence," and as is usually the
case with p(ersons wh\ose genius lies that way, he was soon left
entirely to hii-imself, no one thinlking it wortli while to take the
trouble of extracting words fro)m him. In truth, he was so impracticable, and at the same time so evidently insignificant, and
so totally uninteresting, that his fellow-passengers tacitly conveved himi to Coventry; and in Coventry lie seemed perfectly
satisfied to dIwell. Oiice or twice Captain Santlow was asked
again if he recollected the name of that gentleman; but he
always replied with a sort of smile, "I cannot say I do-not
exactly, at least--but I'll look at my manifest and see"-and he
never failed to turn the conversation to something else.
The only person that persisted in occasionally talking to that
gentleman, was old Mrs. Cummings; and she confided to him
her perpetual alarms at " the perils of the sea," considering him
a good hearer, as he never made any reply, and was always disengaged, and sitting and standing about, apparently at leisure,
while the other gentlemen were occupied in reading, writing,
playing chess, walking the deck, &amp;c.
Whenever the ship was struck by a heavy sea, and after
quivering with the shock, remained motionless for a moment
before she recovered herself and rolled the other way, poor Mrs.
Cummnings supposed that we had run against a rock, and could
not be convinced that rocks were not dispersed everywhere
about the open ocean.   And as that gentleman never attempted to undeceive her on this or any other subject, but
merely listened with a placid smile, sbe believed that he always
thought precisely as she did. She not unfrequently discussed

to him, in an under tone, the obstinacy and incivility of the
caiptain, who, she averred, with truth, had inever in any one instance, had the politeness to stop tile slhip, often as she had requested, nay, implored himn to do so even when she was suffering with sea-sickness, and actually tossed out of her berth by
the violence of tlle storm, though she was holdinig on with both
hands....
In less than a fortni7ght after we left the English Channel we
were off the banks of Ncwfbundland; and, as is frequently the
case in their vicinlity, we met with cold fogvry weatlher. It
cleared a little about seven in the morning, and we then discovcred no less than thrce icebergs to leewttard. One of thenm,
whose distance froin us was perhiaps a mile, appeared higher
than the main-nlatst head, and as the top shot up into a tall
column, it looked like a vast rock with a lighlt-house on its pinnacle. As thle cold and watery sunbeaml  gleamned fitfuillv upon
it, it exhibited in sonme places the rainb,;ow tints of a prism--
other parts were of a dazzling white, while its sharp angular
projections seemed like 1masses of diamonds glittering upon
snow.
The fog soon became so dense that in looking over the sllip
we could not discern the sea. Fortunately, it was so calm that
we scareely moved, or the dl:aner of drivinlg on the icebergs
wouldl have been terrific. We llad now no otlher means of ascertaining our distlance froml them, but by trying the temper1ature of the water witll a tllermollmlleter.
In the afteranoon the fofg gatlhered still more thickly round us,
and dripped frot the riggin, so that the sailors were continaallyt swabbing the deek.  I ilad gone  witlh Mr. Fenton to the
round-house, and looked awlhile fromn its wintdows on the comfortless sceine without. The only persons then on the m1aindeck we re the ciaptain and the firsgt imate. They were wrapped
in their watch-coats, their hair and whiskers drlpping with the
fog dew. Most of the passengers went to bed at an earlv hour,
anid soon all was awfully still; Mrs. Cummiinr being really too
much frigiltened to talk, only that she sometimes wished herself in Stioreditch, and sometimes in Iloundsditch.  It was a
night of real danger. The captain remained on deck till mIorning, and several of the gentlemen bore him company being too
anxious to stay below.
About dav-break, a beavv shower of rain dispersed the fog"The conscious vessel waked as from a trance." A breeze sprung
up that carried us out of danger from the icebergs which were

soon diminished to three specks on the horlizon, and the sun rose
bri,hlit and cheerfilly.
Tow:ard noon, the ladies recollected tlhzt none of them had
seen that gentlelman diiiuring the last twenty-four hours, and
some apprehension was expressed lest he should have walked
overboard in the fogr. No one could give any account of him,
or remember his last appearance; anld Aliss Audley professed
much ryegret that nwi in all probability we shIonuld never be able
to ascertain his nalne, as, Inost likelv lhe had "died and made
no sign."  To our shames be it spoken, Inot onle of us could cry
a tear at lhis possible fate. The captain iad turned into his
berth, and was reposing himnself after tile fatigue of last nighlt;
so we could Inake no inquiry of him on, tie subject of our Inissing fellow-passenger.
Mrs. Cummings called the steward, antd asked him how long
it wa.s since he had seen anything of that gentlemnan. " I really
can't tell, Inadain," repliel Ilamilton(-" I can't pretend to cliarge
mvy nemorv with such things. 13But I conclude he must have
been seen yesterday-at least I ratlher expect he was."
The waiter Juba was now appealed to.  " I believe, madam,"
said Jbtla, " I rememT-ber soTmethlin,g of haniditng that gentleman
the bread-ba.sket yesterday at dlinner-ibut I would not be qualified as to whether the thing took place or not, my mind beingl
a good deal engaged at the time."
" Solomon, the third waiter, disclaimed all positive knowledgre
of this or any other fact, but sagely remarked, "that it was very
likely that gentleman had been about all yesterday as usual:
yet still it was just as likely he mirlht not; and there was only
one tliing certain, which was, that if he was not nowhere, he
must, of course, be somewhere."
"I have a misgiving," said Mrs. Cummings, "that he will
never be found again."
"I'll tell you'what I can do, madam," exclaimed the steward,
lookinig as if suddenly struck with a bright thought-" I can
examine into No. eleventeen, and see if I can perceive him
there." And softly opening the door of the state-room in question, lie stepped back and said with a triumphant flourish of his
handcl-" There he is, ladies, there he is, in the upper berth fast
asleep in his double ca.shmere dressing gown. I opinionate
that he was one of the gentlemen that stayed on deck all night,
because they were afraid to go to sleep on account of the icebergers--of course nobody noticed himn-but there he is now,
safe enough."

"W'ell," said Mrs. Cummings, "he is not dead, however, so
we have yet a chance of knowil)g his namle fro,mi hiiiuseltf, if we
choose to ask hiin.  But I'm determined I'll ina;ke the captain
tell it Ime, as soon as he gets up.  It's all nonsense, this making

Among the numerous steerage passen,ters was a votunii man,
whose protlssion was tllhat of a imethodist preacher.  lavitng
succeeded in Imaking sonlie religious impressiotns oni the imnrajority
of his coimpanions, he one Siundlay obtained their cocl-lent to hlis
performing divine service that evening in thei steertage; anil respectfillly intimated that he would be IhighlIr gratitio,dl by the
attendanrce of any of thle cabin passengers that would( condescened to lhonor himin so far. Accordingly, after tea, we all descended to the steerage at early candle-light, and tountid everything prepared for the occasio)u.  A barrel, its he,ad cover~ed
with a piece of sailcloth, served a. a desk, lighted by two ytellowish dip-cntludles placedl in empty porter bottles. But as there
was considerable motion, it was found that the bottles ^would
not rest in their stations; therefore they were held by two boys.
The chests and boxes nearest to the desk were the seats allotted
to the ladies and gentlemen: and the steerage people rag,ed
theimselves behlind.
A hymn was sung to a popular tune.    The prayer and serm1on were delivered in simple but impressive laniuage; tfr thle
preacher, though a poor and illiterite man, was not deficivent
eitlher in sense or feeling, and was evidently imnbued with the
sincerest piety. Thlere was somethling solemln andlt aiffctingl in
the aspect of the whole scenei, with all its rude arranw.ement;
and also in the idea of the lonel; a11nd insulated situationi of our
little commllunity "one wide water all around us."  And when
tlhe preacher, in his homnel  but fervent language, returnled
thanks  for our hitherto prosperous vovyage, and prayed for our
speedy and safe arrival at our destined port, tears stood in the
eyes of many of his auditors.  I thought, when it was over-,
how frequently such scenes imulst have occurred between the
decks of the Mayflower, during the long and tempestuous pa1s

when the wise and pious Brewster lifted his voice in exhortation and prayer, and the virtuous Carver, and the gallant Standish, bowed their heads in devotion before him....
After crossing the Banks we seemed to feel ourselves on
American ground, or ratler on Amlerican sea. As our interest
increased on approaching the land of our destination, that gentleman was proportionally overlooked and forgotten. He " kept
the even tenor of his way," and we had become scarcely conscious that he was still Among us: till one day when there was
rather a hard gale, and tile waves were running high, we were
startled, as we surrounldedl the lutncheon table, by a tremendous
noise on the cabin staircase, and tlle sudden bursting open of
the door at its foot. We all looked tip, and saw that gentleman falling down stairs, with both arms extended, as he held
in one hand a tall cane stool, and in the other the captain's baroieter, which hald hung just witllin the upper door; he having
involuntarily caught hold of both these articles, with a X iew of
saving himself.'L"While his head, as he tumbled, went nicketty
nock,' his countenance, for once, assumed a new expression,
and the change from its usual unvarying sameness was so striking, that cotmbiiied with his ludicrous attitude, it set us all to
laughing. The wAters ran forward and assisted him to rise;
and it was then found that the stool and the barometer had
been the greatest sufferers; one having lost a leg, and the othler
being so shattered that the stair-carpet was covered with glob.
ules of quicksilver. However, he retired to his state-room, and
whether or not he was seen again before next morning, I cannot
positively undertake to say.
On the edge of the Gulf Stream we had a day of entire calm,
whlen "there was not a breath the blue wave to curL"  A thin
veil of haziness somewhat softened the fires of the American
sun, (as it was now called by the European passengers,) and we
passed the whole day on deck, in a delighttul state of idle enjoyment; gazing on the inlhabitants of t-be deep, that like ourselves seemed to be taking a holiday. Dolphins, horse-mackerel, and porpoises were sporting round the vessel, and the
flying-fish "with brine still dropping fromn its wings," was darting up into the sun-light; while flocks of petrels, their black
plumage tinged with flame-color, seemed to rest on the surface
of the water; anad the nautilus, "the native pilot of his little
bark," glided gaily along the dimpling mirror that reflected his
tiny oars and gauzy sail. We fished up larye clusters of seaweerd, amn,r whichl were some benutifull Ipecia,ens of a delicate

It was a lovely day.  The lieutenant anid Ihis iflxilv were all
on deck, anld looked happy. That gentleman looke:i as u sual.
Toward evening, a breeze sprung up directl- f'air, and tille(l the
sails, whiclh all day hIad been clinging idly\- to the lmasts; and
before midnig ht we weire wafted along at the -rate of nine knots
an hour, " while round the waves phosphoric biightness broke,"
the ship seeming,  as she cleaved the foam, to draw after her in
her wake a lon1g train (of stars.
Next dav we continued to proceed rapidly, with a fair wind,
which we kn.ew wouldl soon bring us to the end of our voyage.

" that gentleman went on shore in the nlews-boat; t did yotu niot

"No," was the general reply, "w' ve did niot see him go."  In
truth we hadl:all been too imuchl interested in hearing, reaidilg,
and talking of the nIews brought l,y the boat.
"Thein he is gone forever," exclaimied Mrs. Cummings--"  and
we shall never kniow his name."
"Coime, Captain Santlow," said Mr. Fenton,'I try to recollect it.'Let it not,' as (rumlio ~says,'die in oblivion, while we return

"Hlis name," answered the Claptain,  " is Sir St. John St.

"Sir St. John St. Ledger!" was repeated byv each of the company
"Yes," resumed Captain Santlow, "1 and vou see how difficult
it is to say it simoothly. There is more sibilation in it than in

They are floating through the stillness,
They are giveu to the stormAnd they tremble off like phantoms
Of a joy that has no form.
But the proud tree stands up prouder,
While its brauches ca-st their leaves
And the cold wind whispers louder,
Like a sobbing breath that grieves;
A heart that's long in breaking,
As a single flower may cling,
All wither'd, shorn, and quakingOn the naked stalk till spring.
Then I thought that tree is human,
And its boughs are human too;
For while the leaves were wealthy
With kindling sap and dewWhile the sun shot golden lances

And the birds poured love a nd music,
Where the slanting rays had beenThen its great roots gather'd fragrance,
Like wine-drops froin the ground,
Till it sparkled tllrough the foliage,
As faith fills the profound
Of souls that live together,
In kindred trust antd love--
Till their union seenms immortal,
As the burning stars above.
But the very dews of summer
Had left their own decay;
And change, a rutllle vampire,
Trhat steals the soul away',
Came with the mellow autumn,
And touclhed those leaves with blight;
Then the frost came stealing earthward,
Like a ghost upon the night.
When the frost had done its death-wortk.
When the golden leaves were sre,
And the brown crept dlmly on them
In the old age of the year;
Ah I the roots withdrew their nurture,
While the tree stood firm and high;
Wheu the leaves had lost their greenness,
Lo, it east them off to die I
Then I thought those leaves were weary,
And tllrilled with human pain,
As they fell so cold and dreary
Beneath thle heatin, rain.

Then my soul went sadly after,

As my hopes had taken flight.
So I watched the pale leaves flutter,

On such a vernal lday as this did we, whllo had visited the
Elder on Ihis dleath-bed, walk together to his house in the
Ilazel-glen, to accompany his body to the place of burial. (On
th}e nlight lie died, it seclled to be the deadl of winter.  Ont the
day lie was buried, it seelned to be the birth of spring.  The
old pastor andl I were alone for awhlile, as we pursuedl our plath
up the glen, by the baniks of the little burn.  It had cleared
itself off fi'oiil the melted snow, andI rant so pelltucid a race,
that every stone and pebble was visible in its yellow ch:inniel.
The willows, the alders, and the birclles, tile thiltrcst and the
earliest of our native hill trees, seelncd almnost tiinged witli a
verdant liglit, as if they were buddling; and betineath them,
here and there, peeped ollt, as in the pleasure ot new existelce,
the pri,lrose, lonely, or in little fitnilies aiid flocks. The bee
had not yet ventured to leave his cell, yet the flowers remindled
one of his Imurmur.  A few insects were dancing in the air,
and here atnd there some little nmoorlantd bird, touched at the
heart with the warn, sunny change, was piping his love-sweet
so1ng among the braes.
It was just such a day as a grave, meditative man, like him
we werl' about to ititer, wotild have chosen to walk over his
farin  in religious contentmlent with his lot.  That was the
thollghlt that entered the pastor's heart, as we paused to enjoy
one brighter gleam of the stln in a little meadow-field of peculiar beauty.  " This is the la-st dav of the week, and on that
day often did the Eller wCalk throllrh this little happy kingdoln
of his own, with somne of hlis gran;dchlildren besidle and aro,und
lhim, anid often Iis Bible in ihis haund.  It is, yotu teel, a solitary
place; all the vale is one Seclusion; and otteu, have its quiet
bounids been a place of undisturbed nedlitation and prayer.
We now calne in sight of the cottage, and beyond it the termination of the glen. There the high hills came sloping gently
down; and a little waterfall, in the distance, gave aninmation
to a scene of perfect repose.  We were now joined by various
small parties coming to the funeral through openingrs amll,ong
the hills; all sedate, but none sa,l, atnd] everty  greetitu was that
of kindness and peace. The Elder had died full of years; and
there was no need why any out of his own household shoultd254
w ",:p.  A long life of piety had been beautifully   closed; and,
theret'ore, we were all goitlg to coinmit the body to the earth,
assulred, as far as hutnan beings may be so assured, that the
soul was in heaven. As the party increased on our approach
to the house, there was even cheerfulness among us.  We
spoke of the early and bright promise of spring; of the sorIrows and the joys of other families; of marriages and births;
of the new schoolmaster; of to-morrow's Sabbath. There was
no topic, of whiclh, on any common occasion, it mifrht have
been fitting to speak, that did not now perhaps occupy, for a
few moments, some one or other of the groulp, till we found
ourselves ascending the green sward before the cottage, and
stood beftre the bare branches of the sycamores. Then we
were all silent, and, after a short pause, reverently entered into
tlhe house of death.
At the door, the son received us with a calm, humble, and
untroubled face; and, in his manner toward the old minister,
tllere was something that could not be inisunderstood, expressinl penitence, gratitude, and resignation. We all sat down
inll tile large kitchen; and the son decently received eachl person at the door, and showed him to his place. There were
s,me old, gray heads, more becoming gray, and many bright
it inlnhood and ad outh. But the same solemn hush was over
tlheln all; and tlhey sat all bound together in one unitin)g and
alsinilUating spirit of devotion and faith. Wine and breadi were
t.) be sent round; but the son looked to the old minister, who
ritsV, lifted up his withered hand, and began a blessing and a
pl.l ter.'lhere was so muLch composure and stillness in the old man's
attitude, and something so affecting in his voice, tremulous and
r)loktlcn, Inot in grief, but age, that no sooner had he begrun to
pray, than everv heart and every breatlh at once was hushed.
All stood motionIless, nor coulldt one eve abstain from  that
pla.cid and patriarchal counteinance, withl its closed eyes, and
1,l, silvery hair. There was nothing sad in his words, but
tlhey were all humble and solemn, and at tinmes even joyful in
the kindling spirit of piety and faith. Ile spoke of the dead
oiman's goodness as imperfect in the eyes of his Great Judge,
bult such as, we were taught, might lead, through intercession,
to the kingdom of heaven.   Might the blessing of God, he
prayed, which had so long rested on the head now coffined, not
torsake that of him who was now to be the father of this
house. There was more joy, we were told, in hearven, over

one sinner that repentetlh, thaIn over niniety and nine just persons which need no repentance. Fervently, too, and tenderly,
did the old Illan pray for her, in her silent chamber, who had
lost so kind a parent, andr for all the little children round her
knees. Nor did he end his prayer without some allusion to
his own gray hairs, and to the approaclhing day on which many
then present would attend his burial.
Just as lie ceased to speak, one solitary, stifled sob was
heard, and all eves turned kindly round to a little boy who
was standing by the side of the Elder's son. Restored once
moreto his own fitlher's love, his heart had been insensibly
filled with peace since the old man's deatlh. The returning
tenderness of the livilng came in place of that of the dead, and
the child yearnldl toward liis fatller now with a stronger affection, relieved, at l:st fronlm all his fear. Ile had been suffered
to sit an hour each day beside the bed on which his grandfather lay shrouded, and he had got reconciled to the cold, but
silent and happy looks of death. IIis mother and his Bible
told him to obey God, without repiaing, in all things; and the
child did so with perfect simplicity. One sob had found its
way at the close of tlhat pathetic prayer; but the tears that
bathed his glistening cheeks were far different from those tlhat,
on the day and niglht of his grandfather's decease, had burst
from the agony of a breaking heart. The old minister laid his
hand silently upon his golden head; tlhere was a momentary
murmur of kindness and pity over the room; the child was
pacified; and again all was repose and peace.
A sober voice said that all was ready, and the son and the
minister led the wav reverently out into the open air. The
bier stood before the door, and was lifted slowly up with its
sable pall. SilentlSy each mourner took his place. The sun was
shining pleasantlv, alnd a gentle breeze passing throughl the sycamores, shook dowvn the glittering rain-drops upon the funeral
velvet. The small procession, with an instinctive spirit, began
to move along; and as I cast up mv eyes to take a farewell look
of that beautifuil dlwelling, now finally left by him who so long
had blessed it, I saw, at the half open lattice of the little bedroom window above, the pale, weeping face of that stainless
matron, who was taking her last passionate farewell of the mortal remains of her father, now slowly receding from her to the
quiet field of graves.
We proceeded along the edges of the hills, and along the
meadow-fields, crross, d the old wooden bridge over the burt,

now widening in its course to the plain; and in an hour of pensive silence, or pleasant talk, we found ourselves entering, in a
closer body, the little gateway of the churchyard. To the tolling of the bell we moved across the green nmounds, and arranged
ourselves, according to the plan and order which our feelings
suggested, around the bier and its natural supporters. There
was no delay. In a few minutes the Elder was laid among the
mould of his forefathers, in their long-ago chosen spot of rest.
One by one the people dropped away, and none were left by
the new-made grave but the son and his little boy, the pastor
and myself. As yet nothing was said, and in that pause I
looked around me, over the sweet burial ground.
Each tombstone and grave, over wlich I hlad often walked in
boyhood, arose in my nlemory as I looked steadfastly upon their
long-forgotten inscriptions; and many had since then been
erected. The whole character of the place was still simple and
unostentatious; but, froln the abodes of the dead, I could seo
that there had been an inlprovement in the condition of the living. There was a taste visible in their decorations, not withlout
much of native feeling, and, occasionally, something even of native grace. If there was any other inscription than the name
and age of the poor inhabitants below, it was, in general, some
short text of Scripture; for it is most pleasant and soothing to
the pious mind, when bereaved of friends, to commnemorate them
on earth by some touching expression taken from that Book,
which reveals to theln a life in heaven.
There is a sort of gradation, a scale of forgetfulness, in a
country churchyard, where the processes of nature are suffered
to: go on over the green place of burial; that is extremely, affecting in the contemplation. The soul goes, from the grave
just covered up to that which seems scarcely joined together,
on and on to those folded and bound by the undisturbed verdure of many, many unremembered years. It then glides at last
into nooks and corners where the ground seems perfectly calm
and waveles, utter oblivion having smoothed the earth over the
long mouldered bones. Tombstones, on which the inscriptions
are hidden in green obliteration, or that are mouldering, or falling to a side, are close to others which last week were brushed
by the chisel: constant renovation and constant decay, vain attempts to adhere to memorS, and oblivion now baffled, and now
triumphant, smiling among all the memorials of human affec
tion, as they keep continually crumbling away into the world of
udiutinguishable dust and ashes.
258THE L)ADIES' READER.
The churchyard, to the inhabitants of a rural parish, is the
place to which, as they grow older, all their thoughts and feeliilgs tturn. The young tuake a look of it every Sabbath-day, not
always perilaps a careless look, but carry away from it, unconsciously, many salutary impressions. What is more pleasant
tlhan the meeting of a rural congregation in the churchyard before the minister appears? What is there to shudder at in lying
down, sooner or later, in such a peaceful and sacred place, to be
spoken of frequently on Sabbath among the groups of which
we used to be one, and our low burial-spot to be visited, at
such times, as long as tllere remains on earth any one to whom
our face was dear!  To those who mix in the strife and dangers of the world, the place is felt to be uncertain wherein they
may finally lie at rest. The soldier, the sailor, the traveler, can
only see some dim grave dug for him, when he dies, in sonmo
place obscure, nameless, and unfixed to imagination. All he
feels is, that his burial will be, on earth or in the sea. But the
peaceful dwellers, who cultivate their paternal acres, or tilling
at least the same sm;all spot of soil, shift only f*romt a cottage
on the hillside to one on the plain, still within the bounds of
one quiet parish; they look to lay their bo,nes, at last, in the
burial place of the kirk in which they were baptized, and with
them it alhnost literally is but a step froln the cradle to the grave.
Sucl were the thoughlts that calmly followed each other in
my revery, as I stood beside the Elder's grave, and tho trodden
grass was again lifting up its blades from the pressure of many
feet, now all but a few departed. What a simple burial lhad it
been! Dust was consigned to dust; no more. Bare, naked,
simple, and austere is, in Scotland, the service of the grave. It
is left to the soul itself to consecrate, by its passion, the mould
over which tears, but no words are poured. Surely there is a
beauty in this; for the heart is left unto its own sorrow, according as it is a friend, a brother, a parent, or a child, that is covered up from our eyes. Yet call not other rites, however different from this, less beautiful or pathetic. For willingly does
the soul connect its grief with any consecrated ritual of the
dead. Sound or silence, music, hymns, psalms, sable garments,
or raiment white as snow, all become hoy symbols of the soul's
affection; nor is it for any man to say which is the most natural,
which is the best of the thousand shows, and expressions, and
testimonies of sorrow, resignation and love, by which mortal
beings would seek to express their souls, when one of their
brethren has returned to his parent dust.

My mind was recalled from all these sad, yet not unpleasant
fancies by a deep groan, atld I beheld the Elder's son fling himself down upon tile grave, and kiss it passionately, imploring
pardon fromn God. " I distressed my tilther's heart in lhis old
age; I repented, and received1 thy forgiveness even on th}
death-bed! But how nny I be assured thart God will forgive
me for having so sinned against my old, gray-headed father,

minister stood at the head of the grave, without speakinlg a
word, with hlis solemn and pitifill eyes fixed upon the prostrate
and contrite man. HIls sin lhad been great, tand tears that till
now had, on this day at least, bee*cotmipressed within his lheart
by the presence of so many of his frie,ds, now poured down
upon the sod as if they would have found their way to the very
body of his father.  Neither of us offered to lift him up, for we
felt awed by the ruefuil passion of his love, hlis remorse and his
penitence t; and natture, we felt, ougllt to lhave her way. " Fear
not, my son," at length said the old man, in a gentle voice,
"fear not, my son, bult that you are already forgiven.  Dost
thou not feel pardon within thy contrite spirit?"  He rose up
from  his knees with a faint smile, while thie minister with his
white head yet uncovered, held his hands over himn as in benediction; and that beautiful and loving child, who had been
standing in a fit of weeping ttrror at his father's agony, now
came up to himi, and kissed his cheek; holding in his little
hand a few faded primtroses, which he had unconsciou.ly gathered together as they lay on the turf of his grandfather's grave.

softer and more luxuriant vegetation. Lofty natural mounds
rose amnidst the rest, withl the saie lovely andi sweeping outlille,
showing everywhere thie plastic power of water,-water, mother
of beauty, whiclh, by its sweet and eager flow, had left such
lineaments as human genius never dreamt of.
Not far from the river was a high crag, called the Pine
Rock, which looks out, as our guide observed, like a hellnet
above the brow of the country. It seems as if the water left
here atnd there a vestige of forms and materials tlhat preceded
its course, just to set off its new and richer designs.
The aspect of this country wtas to me enchantintig, beyond
anly I have ever seen, from its fulness of expression, its bold
anti imnpassionIed sweetness.  Ilere the flood of emotion has
passed over and marked everywhere its course by a smile. The
fragments of rock touch it with a wildness and liberality which
give just the needed relief.  I should never be tired here,
though I have elsewhere seen country of more secret and alluring charms, better calculated to stimulate and suggest.  Here
thel  e and heart are filled.
lIow bhappy the Indians must have been here! It is not
long since they were driven away, anld tlle ground, above and
below, is full of their traces.
"The earth is full of ttilen."
You have onily to turn up the sod to find arrowheads and
Indiain pottery.  On anl island, belonging to our host, and
nearly opposite his house, they loved to stay, and no doubt,
enjoyed its lavish beauty as much as the myriad wild pigeons
that now haunt its flower-filled shades.  Here are still the
marks of their tomahawks, the troughs in which they prepared
their corn, their caches.
A little way down the river is the site of an ancient Indian
tVillage, witlh its regularly arranged mounds. As usual, they
had chosen with the finest taste.  When we went there, it was
one of those soft, shadowy afternoons when Nature seems
ready to weep, not from grief, but from an overfull heart. Two
prattling, lovely little girls, and an African boy, with glittering
eye and ready grin, made our party gay; but all were still as
we entered tbe little inlet and trod those flowery paths.  They
may blacken Indian life as they will, talk of its dirt, its brutality, I will ever believe that the men who chose that dwellingplace were able to feel emotions of noble happiness as they
returned to it, and so were the women that received them.

Neither were the children sad or dull, who lived so familiarly with the deer and tile birds, anld swain that clear wave in
the shadow of the Seven Sisters.   Tilhe whole scene suggested
to me a Greek.splendor, a Greek sweetness, and I can believe
that an Indian brave, accustomled to ramble in such paths, and
be bathed bv such sunbeams, might be mistaken for Apollo, as
Apollo was for him  by West.    Two of the boldest bluffs are
called the Deer's Walk, (1not because deer do not walk there), and
the Eagle's nest.  The latter I visited one glorious morning; it
was tlliht of the fourth of July, and certainly I think I had
never felt so happy that I was born in America. Woe to all
country folks that never saw this spot, never swept an enraptured gaze over the prospect that stretched beneath.      I do
believe Rome and Florence are suburbs compared to this capital of Nature's art.
The bluff was decked with great bunches of a scarlet variety
of the milkweed, like cut coral, and all starred with a mysterious-looking (lark flower, whose cup rose lonely on a tall stem.
This had, fo-r two or three days, disputed the ground with the
lupine andf phlox.  My comllpanions disliked, I liked it.

I climb'd the dark brow of the mighty Hellvellyn,
Lakes and mountains benenth me gleam'd misty and wide;
All was still, save by fits when the eagle was yelling,
And starting around me the echoes replied.
On the right, Striden-edge round the Red-tarn was bending,
And Catchedicam its left verge was defending,
One huge nameless rock in the front was ascending,
When I markfd the sad spot where the wanderer had died.
Dark green was the spot mid the brown meadow heather,
Where the pilgrim of nature lay stretch'd in decay,Like the course of an outcast abandon'd to weather,
Till the mountain-winds wasted the tenantless clay.
Nor yet quite deserted, though lonely extended,
For faithful in death, bis mute favorite attended,
The much-loved remains of her master defended,
And chased the hill-fox and the raven away.
How long didat thou think that his silence was slumber?
When the wind waved his garment how oft didst thou start?
Howi many long days and long weeks didst thou number,
Ere he faded before thee, the friend of thy heart?

TIBE RA~1EN.-EnDas A. Pot.
Once upon a midnight dreary,
While I ponder'd, weak and weary,
Over many a qulaint and curious
Volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping,
Suddenly thlere came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping,
Rapping at my chamber door.
"'Tis some visiter," I mutter'd,
" Tapping at my chamber doorOnly this, and nothing more."
Ah, distinctly I remember,
It was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember
Wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wisli'd the morrow;
Vainly I liad tried to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrowSorrow for the lost, LenoreFor the rare and radiant maiden
Whom the angels name LenoreNsmeless here for evermore.
26688THE LADIES' READER.
And the silken, sad, tincertain
IRustling of eafcll purple curtain
Thrill'd mc--ill'd me wit tlantastic
Terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating
Of my heart, I stood repeating
"'Tis some visiter entreating
Eutrance at my chamber doorSome late visiter entreatitng
Entrance at my lchamber door;
This it is, and notinDg more."
Presently my soul grew stronger;
Hesitating thlln no longer,
"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly
Your forgiveness implore;
But the fact is, I was napping,
And so gently you eame rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping,
Tapping at my cllamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you,"
Here I open'd wide tle door:
Darkness there, and nlotling more  
Deep into that darkness peering,
Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal
Ever dared to dream before:
But the silence was unbroken,
And the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken
Was the whisper'd word, " Lenore I"
This I whisper'd, and an ecllo
Murmur'd back the word "Lenore l"
Merely this, and nothing more.
Then into the chamber turning,
All my soul within me burning,
Soon I heard again a tapping
Somewhbat louder than before.
"Strely," said I, "surely that is
Something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then. what thereat is,
And this mystery exploreLet my lheart be still a moment,
And this mystery explore;'Tis the wind, and nothing more I"
Open here I flung the shutter.
When, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepp'd a stately raven
Of the saintly days of yore;
267TH1E LADLES' READER.

Not atn instdant stopp'd or stay'd he;
But, witlh nloien of lord or hldy,

Just above my chamber doorPerch'd, and sat, and uothling more.
Then this ebony bird beguiling
My sad fancy ilto smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum
Of the countenancel it wore.
"Though tllhy crest be slhorn and shaven,

Ghastly grim and ancient raven,
Wanuderitg fromt tlhe Nig htly slhoreTell me what thyv lordly name is

Quoth the raven "Nevermore."
Muchl I marvell'd this ungainll
Fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its antswer little umeanintgLittle relevancy bore;
For we cantnot lhelp agreeing
That no living lhuman bIe   ing
Ever yet was blessMd witli seeing
Bird above hlis clhamber doorBird or beast upon the sculptured
Bust above his chamber door,
With such name as " Nevermore."
But the raven sitting lonely
On tihe placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if lhis soul in
That one word lihe did outpour.
Notheing farther then he iitter'dNot a feather thetn hle flutter'dTill I scarcely more than mutter'd' Other friends have flown before--
On the tnorrow he will leave me,
As my hopes have flown before."
Then the bird said "~N'evermore."
Startled at tte stillness broken
By reply so aptly spoken.
"Doubtless,' said 1, i" what it utters
Is its ontly sto, k and store
Caughit from some unhappy master
Whom unmereiful It'isater
Follow'd fast and fo low'd faster
Till his songs one burden bore--
268269
Till the dirges of his Hope the
Melancllholy burden bore
Of' Nevermore'-of' Nevermore.'"
But the raven still beguiling
All my sad soul into smtiling,
Straight I wheel'd a cushion'd seat in
Front of bird, and bust and door;
Then' upon the velvet sinking,
I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking
What this ominous bird of yore--
Whllat this grim, ungainly, ghastly,
Gaunt and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking " Nevermore."
This I sat engaged in guessing,
But no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose tiery eyes now
Burn'd ilto my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divitling,
With my head at ease reclining
On the culshion's velvet lining
That the lamplight gloated o'er;
But whose velvet violet lining
With the lamplight gloatinlg o'er,
She shall press, al, never more  
Then, methought, the air grew denser,
Perfum'd from an unseen censer,
Swung by angels whose faitnt foot-falls
Tinkled on tlhe tlfted floor.
"Wretch,' I cried, "thy GKod hath lent thee
By these angels he hath sent thee
R  e-rerespite and nepenthe

Quoth the raven " Nevermore."

POE"TRY AN) NATURKE.-RALP1 WALDO EXuzaso.
BY Latin and English poetrv, we were born and bred in an
oratorio of praises of nature-flowers, birds, mountains, sun,
and moon; yet the naturalist of this hour finds that he knows
nothing, by all their poems, of any of these fine things; that he
has conversed with the merest surface and show of them all;
and of their essence, or of their history, knows nothing. Further inquiry will discover that nobody-that not these chanting
poets themselves, knew anything sincere of these handsome natures they so commended; that they contented themselves with
the passing chirp of a bird that they saw one or two mornings,
and listlessly looked at sunsets, and repeated idly these few
glimpses in their song.  But, go into the forest, you shall find
all new and undescribed.  The screaming of the wild geese, flying by night; the thin note of the companionable titimouse, in
the winter day; the fall of swarims of flies in autumn, from combat, high in the air, pattering down on the leaves like rain; the
a~ngrv hiss of the wood-birds; the pine throwing out its pollen
for the benefit of the next century; the turpentine exudinlg
frion the tree-and, indeed, any vegetation-any animnation,
alny atld all are alike unattempted. The man who stands on

the sea-shore, or who rambles ill tile woods, seems to be the
first man that ever stood on the shore, or entered a grove, his
sensations and his world are so novel and strange.'Whilst I
read the poets; I tllink thlat nothing new can be said about
morning and evening; but wheni I see the daybreak, I am not
reminded of these homeric, or Shakspearian, or Miltonic, or
Chaucerian pictures. No; but I feel, perhaps, the pain of an
alien world-a world not yet subdued by the thought; or I am
cheered by the moist, warm, glittering, budditng, melodious
hour, that takes down the narrow walls of my soul, and extends
its life and pulsation to the very horizon. That is morning, to
cease for a bright hour to be a prisoner of this sickly body, and
to become as large as nature.
Thle noondav darknsess of the Amenrican forest, the deep,
echoing aboriginal woods, where the living columns of the oak
and fir tower up from the ruins of the trees of the last mlillenniuln; whtere, fromll year to year, the eagle and the crow see no
inltruder; tile pines, bearded with saviatge moss, vet touchlled
with grace by the violets at their feet; the broad, cold lowland, wllich fcorms its coat of vapor with the stillness of subterranean crystallization; and wllere the traveler amid the repulsive pllnts that are native in the swamp, thinks with pleasing
terror of the distant town; this beauty-l-haggard and desert
beauty, wlich the sun and the moon, the snow and the rain repaiint and varv, has never been recorded by art, yet is not indifferent to any passenger.  All men are poets at heart. They
serve nature for bread, but her loveliness overcomes them sometimes. What mean these joutrneys to Niagara; these pilgrims
to the WhVite Hills?  Men tbelieve in the adaptations of utility,
always. In the mountains, they may believe in the adaptations
of the eyve. Undoubtedly, the changes of geology have a relation to the prosperous sprouting of the cornl and peas in my
kitchen garden; but not less is there a relation of beatty between my soul and the dim crags of Agiocochook up thlere in
the clouds. Every man, when this is told, hearkens with joy,
and yet his own conversation with nature is still unsung.

TILE FALLS OF NIAGARA.-Joun flowlso.
Now that I propose to attempt a description of the Falls of
Niagara, I feel myself threatened with a return of those throbs
of trembling expectation which agitated me on my first visit to
those stupendous cataracts; and to which every person of the
least sensibility is liiable, when he is on the eve of seeing any
thing that has strongly excited his curiosity, or powerfully affected lhis imagination.  The form of Niagiara Falls is that of
an irregufrlar semicircle, aboult three-quarters of a mile in extent.
This is divided into two distinct cascades, by the intervention
of Goat Island, the extremity of whlich is perpendiculiar, and in
a line witlh the precipice over which the water is projected. The
cataract on tlte Callada side of the river is called the Ilorseshoe
or Great Fall, firomi its peculiar form, and that next the United
States, the Americ:an Fall.
The Table Rock, fromln which the Falls of Niagara may be
contemplated in all their grandeur, lies on an exact level w ith
the edge of the cataract oni the Can;ada side, and, indeed, forms
a part of the precipice over which the water gushes. It derives its namle froml the circumlstance of its projecting beyond
the cliffs that stapport it, like the leaf of a table. To gain thlis
position, it is necessary to deseend a steep bank, and to follow
a pathl that winds among shrubbery and trees, which entirely
conceal from the eye the scene that awaits him who traverses
it. When near the termination of this road, a few steps carried
me beyond all these obstructions, and a magnificent amphitheatre of cataracts bursts upon my view with appalling suddenness and majesty.  Ilowevvr, in a moment the scene was concealed fiom mly eves by a tlense cloud of spray, which involved
me so completelv that I did not dare to extricate myself.  A
mingled rushing and thulndering filled mr ears. I could see

nothing except when the wind made a chasm in the spray, and
then tremendous cataracts seemed to encompass me on every
side; wllile below, a ratging and foamly gulf of undiscoverable
extent lashed the rocks with its hissing waves, and swallowed,
under a lhorrible obscurity, the smoking floods that were precipitated into its bosom.
At first the sky was obscured by clouds; but after a few
minutes the sun burst forth, and the breeze subsiding at the
salne time, permitted the spray to ascend perpendicularly. A
host of pyralnidal cloulds rose majestically, one after another,
froim thle abyss at the bottoin of the fill; and eachl, when it had
ascended a little above the edge of the cataract, displayed a
beautiful rainbow, whlichl in a few tmoments was gradually
transft.rred into the bosom of the cloud that immediately succeeded.  The spray of the Great Fall had extended itself
through a wide space directly over me, and, receiving the full
influlence of the sun, exhibited a luminous and magnificent
rainbow, which continued to overarch and irradiate the spot on
which I stood, while I enthusiastically contenmplated the indescribable scente.
The body of water which composes the middle part of the
Great Fall is so immenll se that it descends nearly two-thirds of
the space without being ruffled or broken; and the solemnn
calmnless with which it rolls over the edge of the precipice is
finely contrasted with the perturbed appearance it assumes
after having reached the gulft below. But the water toward
each side of the fall is shattered tile moment it drops over the
rock, and loses as it descends, in a great measure, the character
of a fluid, being divided into pyramlidal-shalped fragments, the
bases of which are turned upwards. The surface of the gulf
below the cataract presents a very singular aspect; seeliing, as
it were, filled with an immnense quantity of hoar frost, which is
agitated by small and rapid undulations. The particles of water
are dazzlingly white, and do not apparently unite together, s
might be supposed, but seem to continue for a time in a state
of distinct comminution, and to repel each other with a thrilling and shivering motion which cannot ea.sily be described.
The noise made by the Horseshoe Fall, though very great, is
far less thanl might he expected, and varies in,loudness according to the state of the atmosphere. W\ hen the weather is clear
and frosty, it may be distinctly heard at the distatlce of ten or
twelve miles-nay, much farther when, there is a steady breeze;
but I hcve frequently stood upon the declivity of the high bank

that overlooks the Table Rock, and distinguished a low thundering only, which at times was altogetber drowned amid the
roaring of the rapids above the cataract. In my opinion, the
concatve shape of the Great Fall explains this circumrstance.
The noise vibrates from one side of the rocky recess to the
other, and only a little escapes firomr its confinement; and even
this is less distinctly heard than it wotld otherwise be, as the
profusion of spray rendels the air near the cataract a very indifferent conductor of sound.
The road to the bottom of the fall presents many more difficulties than that which leads to the Table Rock. After leaving
the Table Rock, the traveler Ilust proceed down the riverl nearly
half a mile, where he will colme to a small cl'han in the bank,
in which there is a spiral staircase enclosed in a wooden building. By descending this stair, which is seventy or eighty feet
in perpendicular height, he will filld bimself under the precipice, on the top of which lie formlerlv walked. A biglh but
sloping bank extends fromtl its base to the edge of tile river; and
on the sumnmit of this there is a narrow, slippery path, covered
with angular fragments of rock, which leads to the Great Fall.
The impending cliffs, hung with a prof\lsion of trees and brushwood, overarch this road, and seem to vibrate with the thunders of the cataract. In some places they rise abruptly to the
height of one hundred feet, and display upon their surfaces fossils, shells, and the organic remains of a former world; thus sublimely leadinlg the minld to contenlplate the convulsions which
nature has undergone since the creation.
As the traveler advances, he is frightfully stulnned bv the appalling noise; for clouds of spray sometimes envelop him, and
suddenly check his faltering steps; rattlesnakes start from the
cavities of the rocks, and the screamns of eagles soaring among
the whirlwinds of eddyitlg vapor, whlich obscure the gulf of the
cataract, at intervals announce that the raging waters have
hurled some bewildered animal over the precipice.   After
scrambling among piles of huge rocks that obstruct his way,
the traveler gains tile bottom of the fall, where the soul can )be
susceptible of but one emotion, namely, that of uncolttrollable
terror. It was not until I had, by frequent excursions to the
falls, in some measure familiarized my mind with their sublimities, that I ventured to explore the petetralia of the great cataract. The precipice over which it rolls is very much arched
underneath; while the impetus which the water receives in its

descent projects it far bevyond the cliff, and thus an immense
Gothic arch is formed by the rock and tlhe torrent.
Twice I entered this cavern, and twice I was obliged to re.

Spray that whirled around me; however, t]he third tinme I succeeded in advancing about twenty-five yards.  Here darkness
bemoan to encircle ime; on one side tle black cliff stretched
itself into a gigantic arch far above my head, and on the other
the dense and hissing torrent forned anl impenetrable sheet of
foam, witli which I was d(renched in a moment.  The rocks
were so slippery that I coult(l hlardly keep 1}my feet, or hold securely by thlem; while the horridl din made me think the precirices above were tumblling down in colossal fragments upon my
ecad..
It is not easy to determine how far an individual might advance between the sheet of water and the rock; but were it
even possible to explore the recess to its ultmost extreinity,
scarcely any one, I believe, would have courage to attempt an
expedition of the kind.
A little way below the Great Fall the river is, comparatively
speaking, tranquil, so that a ferry boat plies between the Canada
and Alnerican shlores ftbr the convenience of travelers. When I
first crossed, the heaving flood tossed about tle skiff with a violence that seemed very alarming; but as soon as,we gained the
middle of the river, my attention was altogetller engaged by the
surpassing grandeur of the scene before me. I was now within
the area of a semicircle of cataracts, more than three thousand
feet in extent, and floated on the surface of a gulf raging fathomless and interminable.  Majestic cliffs, splendid rainbows, lofty
trees, and columns of spray were the gorgeous decorations of
this theatre of wonlers, whiile a dazzling sun shed refulgent
glories upon every part of the scene.
Surrounded with cloudls of vapor, and stunned into a state of
confusion and terror b1w the hidCous noise, I looked upward to
the hcight of one hundred and fifty feet, and saw vast floods,
dense, awful, and stupendonus, vehemlently burrsting over the precipice, and rolling down, as if the windolws of heaven were open,
to pour another delluge uipon the earth. L(,ud sounds, resemnbling discharges of artillery or volcanlic explosions, were now
distinguishable among the watery tumulllt, and added terrors to
the abyss from which they issued. The sun, looking majesticallyv through the ascending spray, was encircled by a radiant
halo, whilst fragments of rainbows floatodf on every side, and

momentarily vanished, only to give place to a succession of
others more brilliant. Looking backward I saw the Niagara
River, again become calm and tranquil, rolling lagnificently
between the towerin(g cliffs that rose on either sile, and receiving showers of orient dewdrops from the trees that gracefully overarched its transparent bosom.
The Niagara Falls appear to the observer of a magnitude inferior to what they really are, because the objects surrounding
do not bear a due proportion to them. The river, cliffs, and
trees are on a comrparatively small scale, and add little to the
composition or granideur of the scene; therefore he who contemplates the cataract reduces them to such dimensions as correspond with those of the contiguous objects; thus divesting one
part of the scene of a good deal of magnificence, without conmmunicatini: ally additional grrandeur to the other.
There have been instances of people being carried over the
falls, but I believe Inone of thle bodies were ever found. The
rapidity of the river, before it tumbles down tle precipice, is so
great, that a human body would certainly be whirled along
without sinking; therefore sone of those individuals, to whom
I allude, probablt retained their senses till they reached the
edge of the cataract, and even looked'down upon the gulf into
which they were the next moment precipitated.
Many years ago, an Indian, while attempting to cross the
river above the falls in a canoe, had his paddle struck from his
hands by the rapidity of the currents. Ile was immediately
hurried toward the cataract, and, seeing that death was inevitable, he covered his head wvith his cloak, and resigned himself
to destruction. However, when he approached the edge of the
cataract, shuddering nature revolted so strongly that he was
seen to start up and stretch out his arms; but the canoe upset,
and he was instantlv illglilfed amidst the fury of the boiling
surge.

puffs of smoke rolling tiup froin the guns of a frigate. It wwa
a deal calm; iiot a penlsile leaf twinkled; the flat expalnse of
the river was without a ripple. We saw the conglomerated
volumes of snow-white vapor ascending to thie zenitli, and below lay the Iludson, roufghening in the now audibly approaching breeze. Meanwhile the sky grew ashy pale in the southwest, and the big clotuds overhead were sometiites veined withl
lightning, wlich was reflected moiently by the darkening
water. Just below us we heard the quick rattle of tlhe rings,
as the wood sloops dropped and reefed their broad siail.s in anticipation of the squall. Everything aroundl us reposed ili a sort
of superntaturial twiligiht, the gri;as turne(l gray and old, the
tree trunks changed to iron, the air seemed (leliser, sullener,
sultrier.  Then a little breeze prattled throulgh the chestnuts,
and whitened the poplars.  Then it subsided. Then the white
cloudl above appeared a tangle of dazzlintf lighlt, and a sharp
fusilade followed on the instant. Then Mrs. Sparrowgrass got
fiightened, and sai(d she must go in, and as she said so, the

three hundred feet above tide water.  Then it slamtuned to

Nevertheless, the scenery arotund was marvellously beautiful.
South of us a grey rain-curtain was drawn across the river,
shutting out everything beyond, except the spectral masts and
spars of a schooner riding at anchor. The I'alisades started up
in the gloom, as their precipitous masses were revealed by the
flashes of unearthly light that played through the rolling
clouds. The river before us, flecked with snow, stretched away
to the north, where it lay partly in sunshiiie, under a blue sky,
dappled.with fleecy vapors. Inland, the trees were twisted in
attitudes strikingly pictuiresqute and novel; the scud flew before the blast like spray, and below it the swells and slopes of
livid green had an a.spect so unusual that it seenmed as if I had
been transported into a strange place-a far countrie. Our cottage, too, whichti I had planned and btuilt, changed its titnted

Cried a whaler in Baffin's Bay.
To know if between the land and the pole
I may find a broad sea-way.
I charge you back, Sir John Franklin,
As yoi would live and thrive:
For between the land and the frozen pole
No man may sail alive.
But lightly laughed the stout Sir John,
And spoke unto his men:
Half England is wrong, if he is right;
Bear off to westward then.
0, whither sail you, brave Englishman?
Cried the little Esquimaux.
Between your land and the polar star

Come down, if you would journey there,
The little Indian said;
And change your cloth for fur clothing,
Your vrssel for a sled.
But lightly laughed the stout Sir John,
And the crew laughed withl him tooA sailor to change from ship to sled,
I ween, were something new I
All through the long, long polar day,
The vessels westward sped;
And wherever the sail of Sir John was blown,
The ice gave way and fled.
Gave way with many a hollow groan,
And with many a surly roar,
But it murmured and threatened on every side
And closed where he sailed before.
Hot se ye not, my merry men,
The broad and open sea?
Bethink ye what the wIhaler said,
Think of the little Indian's sledt
The crew laughed out in glee.
Sir John, Sir John,'t is bitter cold,
The scud drives on thle breeze,
The ice comes looming from the north,
The very sunbeams freeze.
Bright summer goe, dark wiuter comesWe canuot rule the year;
But long e'er summer's sun goes down,
On yonder sea we'll steer.
The dripping icebergs dipped and rose,
And floundered down the gale;
The shlips were staid, the yards were manned,
And fhrled the useless sail
The summer's gone, the winter's come,
We sail not on yonder sa:
Why sail we not, Sir John Franklin?
A  lent man was he.
The summer goes, the winter comes--
We cannot rule the year:
I ween, we cannot rule the ways,
Sir John, wherein we'd steer.

And open a path to the sunny main,

But the hard green ice was strong as death,

WHAT American does not feel proud that lie is descended
from  the countrymen of Bacon, of Newtonl, and of Locke?
Who does not know, that while every pulse of civil liberty in
the lleart of the British empire beat warm and full in thle bosom
of our fathers, the sobriety, the firmnelcss, and the dignlity with
which the cause of free principles struggled into existence here,
constantly found encourarcement and countenanlce from  the
sons of liberty there  Whlo does not remember that when the
Pilgrims went over the sea, the prayers of the faithful British
confessors, in all the quarters of their dispersion, went over
with them, while their aching eyes were strained, till the star
of hope should go up in the western skies?  And who will
ever forget that in that eventful struggle which severed this
mighty empire from the British crown, there was not heard,
throughouit our continent in arms, a voice which spoke louder
for the rights of America, than that of Burke or of Chatham,
within the walls of the British parliarnent, and at the foot of
the British throne? No, for myself I can truly say, that after
my native land, I feel a tenderness and a reverence for that of
my fathers. The pridle I take in my own country makes me
respect that from which we are sprung.
In touching the soil of England, I seem to return like a descendant to the old family seat; to come back to the abode of
an aged, the tomb of a departed parent. I acknowledge this
great consanguinity of nations. The sound of my native language, beyond the sea, is a music to my ear beyond the richest
strains of Tuscan softness, or Castilian majesty.  I am not yet
in a land of strangers while surrounded by the manners, the
habits, the forms in which I have been brought up. I wander
delighted through a thousand scenes, which the historians, the
poets, have made fanliliar to us-of which the names are interwoveL with otur earliest associations. I tread with reverence
the spots where I can retrace the footsteps of our suffering
fathers; the pleasant land of their birth has a claim on my
heart. It seems to me a classic, yea, a holy land, rich in the
memlories of the great and good; the martyrs of liberty,
the exiled heralds of truth; and richer, as the parent of this
land of promise in the west.

land.  I am not dazzled by her riches, nor awed by her power.
The sceptre, the mnitre, and the coronet, stars, garters, alid blue
ribbons, seem to tnme poor tlings for great men to contend for.
Nor is my admiration awakened by her armies, mustered for
the battles of Europe; her navies, overshadowingw the ocean;
nor her empire, grasping the furthest East.    It is these, and
the price of guilt and blood by which they are maintained,
which are the caulse why no friend of liberty can salute her
with undivided affections.  But it is the refiuge of free principles, though often persecuted; the school of religious liberty,
the more precious for the struggles to which it has been
called; the tombs of those who have reflected hlonor on1 all who
speak the English tongue; it is the birtlhplace of our fathers,
the holne of thie pilgrims; it is these which I love and venerate in England.  I should feel ashamed of an enthusiasm    for
Italy and Greece, did I not also feel it for a land like this.  In
an Amnerican it would seem  to ime degenerate and ungratefll,
to hang with passion upon the traces of Homer and Virgil, and
follow  without emotion the nearer and plainer footsteps of
Shakspeare and Milton; and I should think him      cold in his
love for his native land, who felt no melting in his heart for
that other native land, which holds the ashes of his forefathers.

BALLAD FROM THIE GXRMAN.--  zxazun
Among green pleasant meadows,
All in a grove so mild,
Was set a marble image
Of the Virgin and the Child.
There oft, on summer evenings,
A lovely boy would rove,
To play beside the image
That sanctified the grove.
Oft sat his mother by him,
Among the shadows dim,
And told how the Lord Jesus
Was once a child like him.
"And now from highest heaven
He doth look down each day,
And sees whate'er tllou doest,
And hears what thou dost sar."
Thus spake Ihis tender motller:
And on an evening brigllt,
When the red round sun desctended'Mid clouds of crimnion lightAgain the boy was playing;
And earnestly said 1w,
"0 beautiful Lord Jesus,
Come down and play with me."'
"I will find thee flowers tle fairest
And weave for thee a crown-;
I will get thee ripe red strawberriets
If thou wilt but come down.
" O holv, holy mother,
Put him down from off thy knee;
For in these silent meadows
There are none to play with me."
Thus spake the boy so lovely;
The while bis mother heard;
But on his prayer she pondered,
And spake to him no word.
That self-same night she dreamed
A lovely dream of joy;
She thought she saw young Jesus,
There playing with the boy.THE LADIES' READER.

Thus tenderly and kindly

And full of careftll musings,

And thlus it was accomplisheod:
In a short month and day,
That lovely boy, so gentle,
Upon his death-bed lay.

To make the most of his tyrant hour:

Bathing her shroud with gushing tear:

With frantic speech and burning brain.

From the flowers of day and the stars of night;

by their forms and veil the fierce splendors of the sun as they
now and then sail across his face, at the same time portend
wind and storm. All Rome was early astir. It was ushered in

witnessed, followed by troops of boys imitating in their grotesque way the pompous declarations of the men of authority,
not unfrequentlv drawingll down upon their heads the curses
and the batons of the insulted dignitaries.
At the appointed hour we were at the palace of Aurelian on
the Palatine, where a procession, pompous as art and rank and
numbers could make it, was formed, to move thence by a winding and distant route to tile temple near the foot of the Quirinal. Julia repaired with Portia to a place of observation near
the templec-I to the palace to join the company of the emperor.  Of the gorgeous magrnificence of the procession I shall
tell you iotling. It was in extent and ivariety of pomp and
costliness of decoration, a copy of that of the late triumph,
and went even beyond the captivating splendor of the example.
Roman music--which is not that of IalImiyra--lent such charms
as it could to our passage through the streets to the temple,
from a thousand performers.
As we drew nlear to the lofty fiLbric, I thought that no scene
of such various beauty and mabnificence had ever met my eye.
The temple itself is a work of unrivalled art. In size it surpasses any other buildling of the same kind in Rome, and for
the excellence in workmanship anld purity of designi, although
it lmay fall below the standard of Hadrian's age, yet for a certain air of grandeur and luxuriance of invention in its details,
anld lavish profision of embellishment in gold and silver, no
temple or other edifice of any preceding age ever perhlaps rescembled it. Its order is the Corinthian, of the Roman form,
and the entire building is surrounded by its slender coliumns,
each composed of a siugle piece of marble. Upon the firont is
wrought Apollo surrounded by the Hours. The western extremity is approached bv a flight of steps of the same breadth
as the temple itself. At the eastern there extends beyond the
walls to a distance equal to the length of the building a marble
platform, upon which stands the altar of sacrifice, and which is
ascended by various flights of steps some little more than a
gently rising plain, up which the beasts are led that are destined to the altar.
When this vast extent of wall and column of the most dazzling brightness came into view, evtrywhere covered, together
with the surrounding temples, palaces and theatres, with a dense
mass of human beings, of all climes and regions, dressed out in
their richest attire-music from innumerable instruments filling

the heavens with harmony-shouts of the proud and excited
populace every few moments and frotm different points, as Aurelian advanced, shaking the air with its thrilling din--the
neighing of horses, thle frequent blasts of tile trumpet-the
whole made more solemnly imposing by the vast masses of
cloud which swept over the sky, now suddenly unveiling and
again eclipsing the sun, the great god of this idolatry, ans fiom
which few could withdraw their gaze; when at once all this
broke upon my eye and ear, I was like a child who before had
never seen aught but his own village and his own rural temple,
in tile effect wrought upon me, and the passiveness with which
I abandoned myself to tile sway of the senscs. Not one there
was more ravished by the outward circumstance and show. I
thoughlt of Rome's thouisantd years, of her power, her greatness an(l universal emipire, and for a moment my step was not
less proud than that of Aturelian. But after that momentwhen tlhe senses had had their fill, when the eye had seen the
glory, and the car had fed upon the harmony and the praise,
then I thought and felt very differently; sorrow and compas-.
sion for these gay multituides were at my hlealt; prophetic
forebodings of disaster, danger, and ruin to those to whose sacred
cause I had linked myself, made my tongue to falter in its
speech, and my limbs to tremble. I thought that the superstition that was upheld by the wealth and the power, whose manifestations were before me, had its roots in the very centre of
the earth-far too deep down for a few like myself ever to
reach them. I was like one whose last hope of life and escape
is suddenly struck away.
I was roused from these meditations by our arrival at the
eastern front of the temple. Between the two central columns,
on a throne of gold and ivory, sat the emperor of the world,
surrounded by the senate, the colleges of augurs and haruspices, and by the priests of the various temples of the capital, all
in their peculiar costurfe.  Then Fronto, the priest of the
temple, when the crier had proclaimed that the hour of worship and sacrifice had come, and had commanded silence to be
observed-standing at the altar, glittering in his white and
golden robes like a messenger of liglt-bared his head, and
lifting his face up toward the sun, offered in clear and sounding
tones the prayers of dedication. As le came toward the close
of his prayer, he, as is so usual, with loud and almost frantic
cries and importunate repetition, called upon the Sod to hear
him, and then with appropiate names and praises invoked the
301TtIIE LADIES' READER.
Father of gods and men to be present and hear. Just as he
had thus solemlnly invoked Jupiter by name, and was about to
call upon tthe other gods in the samue manner, the clouds, which
had been deepening and darkening, suddenly obscured the sun;
a distant peal of thunder rolled along the heavens, and at the
sanme moment from the dark recesses of the temple a voice of
preternatural power came forth, proclaimling so that the whole
multitude heard the words-" God is but one; the king eternal, immlortal, invisible."  It is impossible to describe the horror that seized those multitudes. Many cried out with fear,
and each seemed to shrinki behind the other. Paleness sat
upon every face. The priest paused as if struck by a power
from above. Even the brazen Fronto was appalled. Aulrelian
leaped from his seat, and by his countenance, white and awestruck, showed that to him it came as a voice fromt the gods.
lie spoke not, but stood gazing at the dark entrance into the
temple from  which tile sound had come.    Fronto hastily
approached him, and whispering but one word as it were into
his ear, the emperor started; the spell that bound him was
dissolved; and recovering himlself--making indeed as though a
very differenlt feeling had possessed him-cried out in fierce
tones to his guards:
"Search the temple; some miscreant hid away among the
columnns profanes thus the worship and the place. Seize him
and drag him forth to instant death."

rushed in at that bidding and searcheld in every part the interior of the building. They soon ermerged, saving tllat the
search was fruitless. The temple in all its aisles and apartments was emIpty.
The ceremionies, quiet being again restored, then went on.
Twelve bulls, of purest white and of perfect forms, their horns
bound about with fillets, were now led by the servants of the
temple up the marble steps to the front of the altar, where
stood the cultrarii and harulspices, ready to slay them and examine their entrails. The omens as gathered by the eves of
all from the fierce strugglings and bellowilgs  of the animals as
they were led toward the place of sacrifice-some even escaping from the hands of those who had the management of them
-and from the violent and couvulsive throes of others as the
blow fell upon their heads, or the knife severed their throats,
were of the darkest character, and broulght a deep gloom upon
the hrow of the emperor. The report of the haruspices upon
302THE LADIES' READER.
examination of the entrails was little calculated to remove tllat
glooln.  It was for the most part unfavorable.  Especially
appalling was the sight of a heart so lean and withered that it
scarce seemed possible it should ever have formed a part of a
living animal. But more harrowing than all was the voice of
Fronto, who prying with tile haruspices into the siloking carcass of one of the slaughtered bulls, suddenly cried out with
horror that " no heart was to be found."
The emperor, hardly to be restrained by those near him from
some expression of anger, ordered a more diligent search to be
made.
" It is not in nature that such a thing sholld be," he said.
"Men are, in truth, sometimes without hearts; but brutes, as I
think, never."
The report was however confidently confirmed.  Fronto
himself approached, and said that his eye had from the first
been upon the beast, and the exact truth had been stated.
The carcasses, such parts as were for the flames, were then
laid upon the vast altar, and the flames of the sacrifice ascended.
The heavens were again obscured by thick clouds, which
accumulating into dark masses, began now nearer and nearer to
shoot forth lightning and roll their thunders. The priest commenced the last office, prayer to the god to whom the new
temple had been thus solemnly consecrated. lie again bowed
his head, and again lifted up his voice. But no sooner had he
invoked the god of the temple and besought his ear, than again
from its dark interior the same awful sounds issued forth, this
time saying "Thy gods, O Rome, are false and lying gods.
God is but one."
Aurelian, pale as it seemed to me with superstitious fear,
strove to shake it off, giving it artfully and with violence the
appearance of offended dignity. His voice was a shriek rather
than a human utterance, as he cried out:
"This is but a Christian device; search the temple till the
accursed Nazarene be found and hew him piecemeal-" more
he would have said, but at the instant a bolt of lightning shot
from the heavens, and lighting upon a large sycamore which
shaded a part of the temple court, clove it in twain. The
swollen cloud at the same moment burst, and a deluge of rain
poured upon the city, the temple, the gazing multitudes, and
the jlust kindled altars. The sacred fires went out in hissing
and (larkness; a tempest of wind whirled the limbs of theTIIE LADLES' R:EADER.
slaughtered victims into the air, and abroad over the neighboring streets. All was confusion, uproar, terror and dismay. The
crowds sought safety in the houses of the nearest inhabitants,
and the porches of the palaces. Aurelian and the senators,
and those nearest him, fled to the interior of the temple. The
heavens blazed with the quick flashing of the lightning, and the
temple itself seemed to rock beneathl the voice of the thunder.
I never knew in Rome so terrific a tempest. The stoutest
trembled, for life hung by a thread.  Great numbers, it has
now been found, fell a prey to the fiery bolts. The capitol
itself was struck, and the brass statue of Vespasian in the forum
thrown down and partly melted.   The Tiber in a few hours
overranl its banks, and laid much of the city on its borders
under water.
But ere long the storm  was over. The retreating clouds,
but still sullenily muttering in the distance as they rolled away,
were gaily lighted up by the sun, which again shone forth in
his splendor. The scattered limbs of the victims were collected and again laid upon the altar. Dry wood being brought,
the flames quickly shot upward and consumed to the last joint
and bone the sacred offerings. Fronto once more stood before
the altar, and now, uninterrupted, performed the last office of
the ceremony. Then around the tables spread within the temple to the honor of the gods, feasting upon the luxuries contributed by every quarter of the earth, and filling high with
wine, the adverse omens of the day were by most forgotten.
But not by Aurelian.  No sTnile was seen to light up his dark
countenance. The jests of Yaruis and the wisomll  of Porphyrius alike failed to reach him. Wrapped up in his own thoughts
he brooded gloomily over what had happened, and strove to
read the interpretation of portents so unusual and alarming.

~OICEM OF GREENWOOD-J. W. S. w  ows.
GREENWOOD has its voices-eloquent ones, intelligible to
our commnon humanity for they speak the universal language
" that makes mankindt akin."  Their teaclings too are beautifil andl impressive.  Iow  suggestive of pure taste are theO
tong/ues that speak in hei Pembowering trees, her winding glades,
her sunny slopes, her mimic lakes, her sinuously arrangred alid
picturesque walks. These are all books exquisitely illustrated,
where the finishing touches have been delicately laid in by the
Great Artist of the Universe! And then what 8srmCons ever
preached by stones can equal the expressive and solemn truths
conveyed by the memorials reared by affection and respect, to
snatch from forgetfillness the remembrance of those who were
once the objects of reverence or of love? Yes, Greenwood has
its voices! At all tinmes and in all seasons every step within
its hallowed precincts is vocal with the sounds of those eloquent
and instructive Inonitors. The revivifying breath of spring is
freig,hted with their utterings; the soft soutlh winds of summer
are laden with their genial teachings; the hollow murmurings
of the autumnal breeze sigh forth their solemn warning.s; and
the winter's blast echoes with symbolical expression the truths
these voices are made to utter. From " morn till dewy eve," in
the broad glare of the meridian sunlight, and under the mellow
radiance of the moon, may be hleard their whisperings, by all
whose hearts are attuned to the reception of genial infltuences
and holy imaginations.
Are these voices as palpable to feeling as to sound?  Can we
arrest them in their airy flights; anld, giving to them the tangible form of type, can we transfer them to our firesides, or carry
them with us to the bustling mart, and the sequestered haunt, or
make them the companions of our wayfaring excursions?  The
experiment is worth the trial, albeit we may fail fuilly to tinslate their meaning, and may not succeed in rendering their eloquent and impressive lessons with equal force and expression as
when they are heard in their own appropriate temple.
Yet to the single-hearted and the sincere, who go forth to
Greenwood "to list to nature's teachings" with simnplicity of
purpose and obedience of slriit, even our itperfect jottingYs

be torgotten.
ILet us put ourselves then in communication with these voices,
and endeavor to interpret their silent but sage like counsellings.
Even afar off we may hear them, for, like the father of the retlrning prodigal, they come to meet us. You may hear the
gertle whisperings, and see their influences, even in the crowded
conveyances which transport the visitants to Greenwood. They
are in communion with that pale yoiung mother, who is seeking
to renew the torn up spring of her love at the grave of her first
born; they are saddening the brow of the ftilter at her side,
and are drawing him, for the moiment, froil the cares and toils
of incessant labor for the thingp of earth; they are opening
anew the fountains of grief in tile widowed and the fatherless;
they are sharpening the memories to which affection, friendship
and reverence cling, while journeying to the shrines of their respective pilgrimages.
Even the mere pleasure-seekers, as they come within the influence of these " warnling voices," are less thotlghtless; and
levity is subdiued under the power of their secret ministrations.
IIow solernn and yet how beautifill are the lessons breathed
into our imental ears, even on the threshold of this hallowed
spot I We are treading the confines of that "bourne from
which no traveler rettlrns," to which we must all be conveyed.

and sacred spot--guarded by the maje.sty of the law, and

have thrown around tlhe sepulchre the aegis of reverenece and

~The voice of inspiration, first sounded in the patriarchal ages
and reverberated through the periods of Mosaic and Christian dispensations, has hallowed the abodes of the dead, forbidding their
desecration for profane or mundane purposes. It is a principle,
too, apparently instinctive in man to honor the resting places
of the departed. Th, untutored Indian venerates the graves of
his ancestors; the rudest savage pays homage to the spot
where lie the relics of his race. The mystic idolatry of Egypt
expended its world-teachbing science in giving an attempted illmortality to the perishing remains of humanity, and their yet
existing stupendous relics of arcbitcture speak trumpet-tongued
to us moderns, how they venerated the memory of the departed.

regard for the honored dead. The disciples of Mahomet hold
their sepulchres in reverence; the worshlllppers of Branrah, the
devotees of Confucius and Fo; the adorers of tile Grand Lanla;
the believers in Zoroaster, and the Persiain fire-worshippers;
the children of Woden, and the ignorant adorer of the "Fetisli
God"-all have testitied an honored regard for the burial places
of the dead.
It is this sacred impulse of nature, sanctioned by the approval of inspiration, that makes these modern ornalnented
remeteries such interesting expository features of the spirit of
our age. The rapidity of modern ilnprovemelnt cannot touch
them.  They, at least, are preserved from the experimenstal process of utilitarianism. New York rushing on to its destined
gigantic altitude, and its torrent-like progress, may transform
temples raised to the worship of the living God into seats of the
money-changers and marts of traffic; and time-honored graveyards may be trampled by her busy crowds, yet Greenwood is
there, clothed in its sacred prerogative of excliusive privileges,
secure from Innovation and preserved from future desecration.
And there, too, may be traced the progress of modern refinemnet, fitly a.ssuming the task of modeling public talsteu, by fostering a love for the beautiful, as exhibited in the comnbination
of Nature iljproved by Art.
In a country like this, wlhere every man may aspire to becolne the owner of a " homestead," and where wealthy proprietors possess domains equal in extent to the largest baronial
est.ates of Europe, the cultivation of a taste for ornamental gardening seems almost to become a duty, for who will deny the
humanizing tendencies of such pursuits?  Greenwood is actually a "Capability Brown," quite as eloquent as the great
modern expounder of the advantages of landscape gardening.
HIow many an embowering residence, and how many a picturesquely ornamented garden, that adds beauty to our country,
miay owe their origin to Greenwood! And what genial home
influences may not have been first awakened by a contemtplation of the beauties which are so admirably blended in these
ornamented resting-places of the loved and honored dead!
If the "voices of Greenwood," are thus suggestive of feelings
of reverence to the dead; if they foster those humanizing influences, which are generated by pure and refined tastes, how
solemnly impressive are other lessons they convey I Not alone
do they say, in the language of the poet:

"Hark I how the sacred calm that breathes around,
Bids every fierce tumultuous passion cease;
In still small accents whispering from the ground
A grateful earnest of eternal peace."
But they speak to us of the busy world, its conflicts and its
toils, teaching us not only how to die, but how to live; they
arm us for the contests of this world's strifes, and as we linger
over the evidences of frail mortality around us, these "voices"
point endless morcals and adorn most eloquent tales.
HYMN TO THE BEAUTIFUL.-R. H. STODDARD.
My heart is full of tenderness and tears,
And tears are in mine eyes, I know not why;
With all my grief, content to live for years,
Or even this hour to die.
My youth is gone, but that I heed not now;
My love is dead, or worse than dead can be;
My friends drop off like blossoms from a bough,
But nothing troubles me,
Only the golden flush of sunset lies
Within my heart like fire, like dew within my eyes I
Spirit of Beauty! whatsoe'er thou art,
I see thy skirts afar, and feel thy power;
It is thy presence fills this charmned hour,
And fills my charmed heart;
Nor mine alone, but myriads feel thee now,
That know not what they feel, nor why they bow;
Thou canst not be forgot,
For all men worship thee, and know it not;
Nor men alone, but babes with wondrous eyes,
New-comers on the earth, and strangers from the skiesl
We hold the keys of Heaven wvithin our hands,
The gift and heirloom of a former state,
And lie in infancy at Heaven's gate,
Transfigured in the light that streams along the lands I
Around our pillows golden ladders rise,
And up and down the skies,
With winged sandals shod,
The angels come, and go, the messengers of God  
Nor do they, fading from us, e'er departIt is the childish heart;
Wre walk as heretofore,
A down their shininlg ranks, but see them nevermore I

ABBOTTSFORD AND MELROSE ABBEY--BAYARD TATLw.
CRossING the Gala we ascended a hill on the road to Selkirk,
and bellold! the Tweed ran below, and opposite, in the midst
of ellbowering trees planted by the hand of Scott, rose the
grev hall.s of Abbottsford.  We went down a lane to the banks
of tlle swift stream, but finding no ferry, as it looked very shallow, we thoughlt we migllt save a long walk by wadinlg across.
The current was ice-cold and very swift, and as the bed was
covered with loose stones, it required the greatest care to stand
upright.  Looking at thle bottom, through the rapid water,
made my head so giddv, I was forced to stop and shut my
eyes; my friend, who had firmer nerves, went plunging on to a
deeper and swifter part, where the strength of the current
made him stagger very unpleasantly.
We found a foot-path on the other side, which led through a
young forest to Abbottsford. Rude pieces of sculpture, taken
from  Melrose Abbey, were scattered around the gate, sonle
half buried in the earth and overgrowvl with weeds. TLe
niches in the walls were filled with pieces of sculpture, and an
antique marble greyhound reposed in the middle of the court
yard.   We rang the bell in an outer ve.stibule, ornamented
with several pairs of antler, when a lady appeared, who, from
her appearamce, I have no doubt was Mrs. Orinand, the " Duenna of Abbottsford," so humorously described by D'Arlincourt,
in his "Three Kingdoms."  She ushered us into the entrance
hall, which has a magnificent ceiling of carved oak and is
lighted by lofty stained windows. An effigy of a knight in
armllor stood at either end, one holding a huge two-handed
sword found on Bosworth Field; the walls were covered with
helmets and breastplates of the olden time.
Among the curiosities in the Armory are Napoleon's pistols,
the blunderbuss of Ilofer, Rob Roy's purse and gun, and theTHE LADIES' READER
offering box of Queen Mary. Through the folding doors between the dining-room, drawing-roomn and library, is a fine
vista, terminated by a niche, in which stands Chantrey's bust
of Scott.  The ceilings are of carved Scottish oak and the
doors of American cedar. Adjoiling the library is his study,
the walls of which are covered with books; the doors and windows are double, to render it quiet and undisturbed.  Ilis
books and inkstand are on the table and hlis writing-chair
stands before it, as if he had left them but a moentct  before.
In a little closet adjoining, where he kept his private ianuscripts, are tile clothes he last wore, his cane and b,tlt, to which
a hammnrer and small axe are attached, and his sword. A narrow staircase led from the study to his sleeping rooln above, by
which he could come down at nighlt and work while his family
slept. The silence about the place is solemn and breathless, as
if it waited to be broken by his returning footstep. I felt an
awe in treading these lonely halls, like that wlich impressed
me before the grave of Washington-- a feelinlg that hallowed
the spot, as if there yet lingered a low vibration of thle lyre,
though the minstrel llad departed forever!
Plucking a wild rose that grew near the walls, I left Abbottsford, embosomned among the trees, and turned into a green lane
that led down to Melrose.
Melrose is the finest remaining specimen of Gothic architeecture in Scotland. Some of the sculptured flowers in the cloister arches are remarkably beautiful and delicate, and the two windows-the south and east oriels--are of a lightness and grace
of execution really surprising. We saw the tomb of Michael
Scott, of King Alexander II., and that of the Douglas, marked
with a sword. The heart of Bruce is supposed to have been
buried beneath the high altar. The chancel is all open to the
sky, and rooks buhild their nests among the wild ivy that climbs
over the crumbling arches. One of these came tamely down
and perched upon the hand of our fair guide. By a winding
stair in one of the towers we mounted to the top of the arch
and looked down on the grassy floor. I sat on thb broken pillar, which Scott always used for a seat when he visited the
Abbey, and read the disinterring of the magic book, in the
" Lay of the Last Minstrel."  I never comprehended its fill1
beauty till then: the memory of M,.lrose will give it athrilling
interest, in the filture. When we left, I was willing to say,
with the minstrel:

Round her head the locks are golden,

Pours his glory o'er the summer

With the mountain's snow.

THE CARELFSi WORD.-MM. NoRm
A word is ringing thlrough my brain:
It was not meant to give me pain;
It had no tone to bid it stay,
When other things lihad passed away;
It had no meaning more than all
Which in an idle hour fall:
It was whenJirst the sound I heard
A lightly-utter'd, careless word.
That word-oh I it doth haunt me now,
In scenes of joy, in scenes of wo;
By night, by day, in sun or shade,
With the half smile that gently play'd
Reproachfully, and gave the sound
Eternal power through life to wound.
Thbre is no voice I ever lheard
So deeply fix'd as that one word.
When in the lauglhing crowd some tone,
Like those whose joyous sound is gone,
Strikes on my ear, I shrink-for then
The careless word comes back again.
When all alone I sit and gaze
Upon the cheerful home-fire blaze,
Lo freshly as when first'twas heard,
Returns that lightly-utter'd word.
When dreams bring back the days of old,
With all that wishes could not hold;

mountain torrent. While all things else are compelled to subserve some useful purpose, it idles its sluggish life away in lazy
liberty, without turningf a solitary spindlte, or atfording even
water power enoltgh to grind the corn that grows upon its
banks. The torpor of its movement iallows it nowhlere a bright,
pebbly shore, nor so mluch as a narrow strip of glistening sand,
in any part of its course. It slumbers between broad prairies,
kissing the long meadow grass, and bathes the overhanging
boughs of elder bushes and willows, or the roots of elmn and ash
trees, and cltumps of maples. Flagrs and rushes grow along its
plashy shore; the yellow water-lilS spreads its broad, flat leaves
on the mayrgin; tand the fragrant, whlite pond lily abounds, generally selecting a position just so far froim the river's brink that
it cannot be grasped, save at the h1azard of plunginri  in.
It is a marvel whence this perfect flower derives its loveliness
andl perfitume, springing, as it does, from tlhe black muld over

life of others.
The Old Manse!-we had almost forgotten it, bult will return
thither through the orcl:ard. This was set oult by the last clergyman, in the decline of his life, when the neighibors laughled
at the hoary-headed man for planting trees, from which he
could have no prospect of gathering fruit. Even lhad that been
the case, there was only so much the better motive for planting
them, in the pure and unselfish hope of benefiting his successors-an end so seldom achieved by more ambitious efforts.
But the old iminister, before reaching his patriarchal age of
ninety, ate the apples from this orchard during many years, and
added silver and gold to his annual stipend, by disposing of the
superfluity.  It is pleasant to think of hitnm, walkig among the
trees in the quiet afternoons of early autumn, and picking up
here and there a windfall; while he observes how heavily the

I have met with no other such pleasant trouble in the worldl,
as that of finding myself, with only the two or three iiiouths
which it was my privilege to feed, the sole inheritor of the old
clelgyman's wealth of firuits. Thlroughout the summecr there
were cherries and currants; and then came autumn, witl) hlis
ilimense burden of apples, dropping tlhemi continually fi-oin Iis
overladen shouldlers, as lie truldged along.  In the stillest afternoon, if I listened, the tlihumip of a great apple was audible, tStllinc witlhout a breatli of wind, firomi thle mere necessity of perfect ripeness. Anld, besides, tilere were pear trees, that flung
down bushels upon blushels of lceavy pears; and peach trees,
whlich in a good year, tomented Incme with paeahes, neither to
be eaten nor kept, nor, witliout labor and p,rplexity, to be
given away.  The idea of an infinite generosity anld inexhaiustible bounty, on the part of our mother nature, was well worth
obtaining throtugh such cares as these. TlJat feeling can be enjoyed in perftction only by the natives of summer islands,
where the bread-tfruit, the cocoa, the palm, and the orange grow
spontaneously, anid hold forth the ever-ready meal; but, likewise, al,lnost as well, by a man long habituated to city life, who
plunges into such a solitude as that of the Old Manse, where
he plucks the tiluit of trees that he did not plant; and which,
thelefore, to my heterodox taste, bear the closer resemblance to
those that grew in Eden.
Not that it can be disputed that the light toil requisite to
cultivate a mloderate ly-sized garden, imparts such zest to kitchen
vegetables as is never foulnd in those of the market gardener.

altogether by their own care. If there be not too many of
themn, each individual plant becomes an object of separate interest. My garden, that skirted the avenue of the Manse, was
of precisely the right extent. An hour or two of morning labor

" Now our Lady be praised!" said the Queen; "'it was but

" And now for the signal from the shore!" exclaimed Catlerine; "miy bosom tells Iime we sihall see this night two lights
instead of one gleam froln that garden of Eden. And tlen,
Roland, do you play your part manfully, and we will dance on
the green sward like midniglht fairies."
Catherine's conjecture misgave not, nor deceived her. In the
evening two beams twinkledl from the cott.age, instead of one;
and the page heard, with beating heatrt, tllhat the new retainer
was ordered to stand sentinel on the outside of the castle.
When he intimlated this news to tlhe Queen, she held her hand
out to him--he knelt, and whlen he raisedl it to his lips in all
dutiftil homage, he foulnd it was damIp and cold as Inarble.
"For (;God's sake, madamn, droop not now---sink not now!"
"Call upon Our Lady, my Liege," said the Lady Fleming" call upon voulr tutelar saitit."
"Call the spirits of the hundred kings you are descended
from!" exclaime(d the page; " in tlis honlr of need, the resolution of a moniarchl were worth tile aid If a l,  t ndred saints."
"'O  Roland Greime," said Mary, in a tone of leep dlespondency,' be true to me-many have been false to mie. Alas! I
have not always been true to myself! Aly mind misgives ime
that I shall die in bondage, and that this bold attempt will
cost all our lives. It was foretold me by a soothsayer in
France, that I should die in prison, and by a violent death-, and
here comes the hour. 0, wolild to God it found me prepared!"
"Madam," said Catherine Seyton, "r.member you are a

freedom, than remain here to be poisoned, as men rid them
of the noxious vermin that liaunt old houses."
"You are right, Catiherine," said the Queen; "and Mary
will bear her like herself. But, alas! your young and buovant
spirit can ill spell the causes which liave broken mine. Forgive
me, my children, and farewell for a while--I will prepare both
mind and body for this awful venture."
They separated, till again called together by the tolling of
the curfew. The Queen appeared grave, but firm and resolved;
the Lady Fleming, with the art of an experienced courtier,
knew perfectly how to disguise her inward tremors; Catherine's eye was fired, as if with the boldness of the project, and

seizing opportunity for the execution of their project.
The keys had, with the wonted ceremonial, tteen presented
to the Lady l.ochleven.  Shle stood with her back to the casement, which, like that of the Queen's apartment, contmmianded a
view of Kinross, with the churlch, w*hich stands at some distance fromn the town, andc nearer to the lake, then connected
with the town by straggling cottages. Witl her back to the

their restraint. Just when, having finished her cereimony as

the page, who stood beside her, andt had handed her the dishes
in succession, looked sidewise to the clihurchyard   and exclaimiced

second, and in that seconld were lost the whole fruits of her
former vigilance. The page held the forged keys under his
cloak, and with great dexterity exchanged them for the real
ones. His utmost address could not prevent a slight clash as
he took up the latter bunch. " Who totaches the keys 1" said
the Lady; and while the page answered that the sleeve of his
cloak had touched theim, she looked around, possessed herself
of the buiich whichl now occupied the place of the genuine
kevs, and again turned to gaze at the supposed corpse-cindles.

he repeated the Lady's last words, "fools look to to-morrow,

" \e hlave but brief time," said Queen Marvy; "one of the
two lights in the cottage is extinguished--that shows the boat
is put off."
"They will row very slow," saidl the page, "or kent where
depth permits, to avoid noise. To our several tasks-I will
communicate with the good Fatlher."
At the dead hour of Inidnight, when all was silent in the
castle, the page put the key into the lock of the wiciket wlich
opened into the garden, and which was at tile bottom of a
staircase that descended from the Queen's apartment. "Now
turn smooth and softly, thou good bolt," said he,'" if ever oil
softened rust'" and li.s precautions had been so effectual, that
the bolt revolved with little or no sound of resistance. He
ventured not to cross the threshold, but exchanging a word
with the disguised Abbot, asked if the boat were ready?
"This half hour," said the sentinel. "' She ies beneath the
wall, too close under the islet to be seen by the warder, but I
fear she will hardly escape his notice in puattingr off again."
"Thme darkness," said the page, "and our protfound silence,
may take her off unobserved, as she came in. Ilildebrand has
the watch on the tower-a heavy-headed knave, who holds a
can of ale to be the best head-piece upon a night-watch. He
sleeps for a wager.",
" Then bring the Qneen," said the Abbot, " and I will carry
Henry Seyton to assist them to the boat."
On tiptoe, with noiseless step and suppressed breath, trembling at every rustle of their own apparel, one after another the
fair prisoners glided down the winding stair, undler the gulidance
of Roland Graeme, and were received at the wicket-gate by

--I will conduct the Queen-and that youth will have the honor to guide Lady Flemclinrg.'"
This was no timlle to dispute the arrangement, althongh it
was not that which Roland Gr, me would have chosen. Catherine Seyton, who well knew the garden path, tripped on before
like a sylph, rather leading tile Abtbot than receiving assistance
-tlhe Queen, her nati've spirit prevailing over feniiale feair, and
a thousand painiful revflectioIls, mlloved steadlily forward, by the
assistance of IIenry Seyton-lwhile the Lady Fleniing, encuinbered with her fears and lier helplessness, Roland Grmilne, mbho
followed in the rear, arid who bore undler the otlher armll a
packet of necessaries belonging to the Queen. Tlhe door of
the garden which communllicated with the silore of the islet,
yielded to one of the kevs of wlhich Rolland had possessed himself, although not until be had tried several-a moniment of
anxious terror and expectation.  Thle ladies wvere tlhen partly
led, partly carried, to the side of tile lake, whiere a boat with
six rowers attended thielm, tile mien coiclhed along the bottom
to secure them  lrom  observation. lHenry Seyton placed the
Queen in the stern; the Abbot offered to assist Cathletritne, but
she was seated by thle Queen's side before he could utter his

will maintain."
"Be silent, minion," said her brother, " for shame, if not for

"Pardon me, madam, if I disobey," said the intractable
young man; and witll one hand lifting in Lady Fleming, he began himself to push off the boat.
She was two fathoms' length firoml tile slhore, and the rowers
were getting her hlead round, when Roland Grteme, arriving,
bounded from the beach and attained the boat, overturning
Seyton, on whom he lighted. The youth swore a deep but
suppressed oath, and stopping Grleme as he stepped toward
thte stern, said, "Your place is not withl ]igh-born dameskeep to the headl and trimi the vessel. Now give way-give\
wav. PRow, fior God and the Queen!"
The rowers obeyedl, and began to pull vigrorously.
"Wh did Xyou not lmuffle the oars?" said Roland Greme;
"this dash mIust iawaken the sentinel. Itow, lads, and get out of
reach of shot; for had niot old IIildebrand, the warder, supped
upon poppy-porridge, this whispering mlust have waked him."
"It was all thline own delay," said Seyton; "thou shalt
reckon with me hereafter for that andc other mnatters."
But Roland's apprehension was verified too instantly to perniit him to reply. The sentinel, whose slumbering had withstood the whispering, was alarmed by the dash of the oars.
I-His challenge was instantly heardl. "A boat-a boat!--bring
to, or I shoot "' And as they continued to ply their oars, he
called aloud, " Treason! treason!" rulng the bell of the castle,
anld discharged lis harquebuss at the botat. The ladies crowded on each other like startled wild-fowl, at the flash and report
of the piece, while the men urged the rowers to the utmost
speed. They heard more thain one ball whiz along the surface
of the lake, at no great distance from their little bark; and
from the lights, uwhichll glanced like meteors from window to window, it was evident the whole castle was alarmed, and their
escape discovered.
"Pull!" again exclaimed Seyton; "stretch to your oars, or I
will spur you to the task with my dagger-they will launch a
boat immediately."
"That is cared for," said Roland; I locked gate and wicket
on them when I went back, and no boat will stir from the
island this night, if doors of good oak and bolts of iron can
keep men within stone walls. And now I resign my office of
porter of Lochleven, and give the keys to the Kelpie's keeping."
As the heavy keys plunged in the lake, the Abbot who till
then had been repeating his prayers, exclaimed, "Now, bless
thee my son! thy ready prudence puts shalne on us all."

POETS AND PDOESY.-LAMARTINE.
ONE of the most natural and universal faculties of man is
that of reproducing, internally by imagination and thought,
and externally by art and speech, the material and moral universe in the midst of which he has been placed by Providence.
Man is the reflecting mirror of nature. Every thing is recreated
by him, and, through poetry, every thing is reanimated and receives new life. It is another state of existence, which God -has
permitted man to make, by multiplying external being in his
thoughts and in his words-an inferior power but not the less
real--which truly creates, although it only does so from   the
elements, the imnages, and recollections of what nature has embodied before him-an imitation like the sport of a child, yet
still the play of the mind upon the impressions which it receives from nature-a play in which we continually reiterate the
fleeting image of the external and internal iworlds, which expainds, passes away, and renews itself unceasingly before us.
Therefore doth poetry mnean CREATION.
Memory is the first element of this creation, because it is by
memory that we retrace upon our minds the image of things
that have passed.  The muses, symbols of inspiration, were said
by the ancients to be the daughters of memory.
Imagination is the second; for imaginatioin colors and animates the outline dlrawn by memory.
Sensitiveness is the third; because, on the sight or rememeorance of past events presenting itself to the mind, sensitiveness
causes us to receive physical or moral impressions almost as
836TII e LADlIES' READ)ER
strotg and ilitense as would be the iimpression of the events
themselves if actutally occurring before our eyes.
Judgment is the fourth; for by it alone are we taughlt in
what order, in what proportions, in whlat relations, and in what
true harmony to combine and arrange these remembrances or
phantasms-these hlistorical or imagiinary incidents or feelings
-that we make them conform as much as possible to nature, to
probability, and to truth, so that they may produce upon ourselves and upon others an impression as complete as if the fiction were realitvy.
The fiftlh clemnent nlecessary to this creation or to this poisy
is the gift of expressing by language what we observe and feel
internally-of producing outwardly what stirs us from withinto paint with words, to give to words, as we may say, the color,
the impression, the movement, the pulsation, the life, the7joy,
or the grief felt by our own hearts at the sight of the object
which we imlaagine.
Lastly, the sixth element necessary to this creation, which we
call poesy, is that the poet's ear should possess mlusical feeling;
for he sings where others speak, and all song requires mutsic to
mark its melody, and to render it more sonorous and imore voluptuous to our senses and to oulir Iimind.
But tie poet, as I have desclribed him, must not only be
gifted with a vast memory, a copious imagination, a keen sensitiveness, a clear judgment, a strong power of expression, a mdsical feeling as well of time as of harmony-he must be a deep
philosopher, for wisdom is the soul of his song; he must be a
legislator, for he should understand the laws which control the
relations of men to each other, which are to society and to nations what mortar is to buildings; he must have the warrior's
spirit, for he has to sing of tile battle-field and the storm of
towns, the march and flight of armies; he must have the soul
of a hero, for he relates the achievements and the devoted sacrifices of the great; he must be a historian, for his poems are narratives; he must be eloquent, for his characters must harangue
and debate; he must have traveled, for he describes, earth, sea,
and mountains, the productions of nature, the monuments of
men, and -the manners of people; he must know animated and
inorganic matter, geography, astronomy, navigation, agriculture,
the arts, and even the common trades of his time, for his songs
extend over heaven, earth, and ocean, and he draws his metaphors, his illustrations, and his comparisons from the motion of
the stars, the handling of vessels, the forms and habits of the

wildest and the tamest beasts-a seaman among sailors, a herdsman among graziers, a laborer among laborers, a smlith among
smiths, a workman among workmen, even a beggar among the
beggars at the palace or the cottage gate. His mind should
be simple as a child's; tender, compassionate, and pitiful as a
woman'; firm and inflexible as that of a judge or of a patriarch; for he tells of the sports, the innocence, and the candor
of childhood, the loves of men and beauteous maidens, the atffections and the woes of the heart, and the sympathy of compassion with misery; he writes with tears; his master-piece is
to make them   flow. lie should be able to inspire men with
pity, the most beaultiful, because the most unselfish of hulman
sympathies. Lastly, he should be truly pious, filled with the
presence and worship of the Almightiy, for he speaks as much
of heaven as of earth. His mission is to make men aspire to
the invisible and superior world; to force all things, even though
inanimate, to proclaim the name of tlhe Most High, and to impress all the emotions lie excites in the mind or in the heart
with that immortal, itnfinite, and undefinable character which is,
as it were, the atmosphere and invisible element of the Divinity.
Such should be the perfect poet; a living epitome of all the
gifts, all the perceptions, all the endowments, all the wisdom,
all the tenderness, all the virtlous and heroic instincts of the
soul--a creature as perfect as our imperfect humanity will
allow.

PRIDE OF ANCESTRY.--DAxs,L WtESTR.
IT is a noble faculty of our nature which enables us to connect our thoughlts, our sympathies, atd our lhappiness with
whabt is distant in place or time; aind, looking before and after,
to lhold communiion at once with our ancestors and our posterity. ltnaHuan and mortal althou,gh we are, we are nevertheless
not i iere instilated beins, without relation to the past or the
filture.  Neither the point of timne nor the spot of earth in
which we physically live, bounds our rational anld intellecttlal
enjoyments.   We live in the past by a knowledge of its history,
and in the future by hope and anticipation.    By ascending to

an association with our ancestors; by contemplating their example and studying their character; by partaking their sentimeults, and imbibing their spirit; by accompanying them  in
their toils; by.sympathizing in their sufferings, and rejoicing in
their successes and tlheir triumphs--we mingle our own existcnce with theirs, and seem to belong to their age. We become
thcir conttemporaries, live the lives which they lived, endure
what thev ecldulred, an(I partake in the rewards wllichl they enjoyed. AAnd in like manner, by running along the line of future time; by contemnplating tile probable fortunels of those who
are coming atter us; by attempting somlnething whlicll imay promote their happiness, and leave some not dishonorable imemorial
of ourselves for their regard whenl we shall sleep witlh the fathers
-we protract our ownt earthly being, and seeCm to crowd whatever is future, as well as all that is past, into the narrow coinpass of our eartthly existence. As it is not a vain and false, but
an exalted and religious irnmagination which leads us to raise
our tllhoughts from the orb wllicll, amidst this universe of worlds,
the Creator has given uts to inhabit, and to send them with
something of the feelinlg which nature prompts, and teaches to
be proper amlong children of the same Eternal Parent, to the
contemllation of the myriads of fellow-beings with which his
goodness has peopled the infinite of space; so neither is it false
or vain to considler ourselves as interested or connected with
our whole race throulgh all time; allied to our ancestors; allied
to our posterity; closely compacted on all sides with othlers;
ourselves being but links in the great chain of beitg, which begins with the origin of our race, runs onward through its successive generations, binding together the past, the present, and
the filture, and terminating at last with the consummation of
all things earthly at the throne of God.
There may be, and there often is, indeed, a regard for ancestry, which nourishes only a weak pride; as there is also a care
for posterity, wlich only disguises an habitual avarice, or hides
the workingfs of a low and groveling vanity. But there is also
a moral and philosophical respect for our ancestors, which elevates the character and improves the heart. Next to the sense
of religious duty and moral feeling, I hardly know what should
bear with stronger obligation on a liberal and enlightened mind,
than a consciousness of alliance with excellence which is departed; and a consciousness, too, that in its acts and conduct,
and even in its sentiments, it may be actively operating on the
happiness of thc,se who co,me after it.  Poetry is follnd to have
341ITHE LADIES' READER.
few stronger conceptions, by wbich it wotuld affect or overwhelm
the mind, than those in which it presents the moving and
speaking image of the departed dead to the senses of the living.
This belongs to poetry only because it is conginmial to our nature.  Poetry is, in this respect, but the handmaid of true philosophy and mnorality.  It deals with us as human being, naturally reverencing those whose visible connection with this
state of being is severed, aind who may yet exercise we know
not what sympathy with ourselves; and when it carries us forward, also, and shows us the long-continued result of all the
ood we do in the prosperity of those who follow us, till it
bears us from ourselves, and absorbs us in an intense interest
for what shall happen to the generations after us, it speaks
only in the language of our nature, and affects us with sentiments which belong to us as humain beings.

Within the darkened chamber sat
A proud but stricken form;
Upon her vigil-wasted cheeks
The grief-wrung tear were warm;
And faster streamed they as she bent
Above a couch of pain,
Wlhere lay a withering flower that wooed
Those fond eyes' freshening rain.
The raven tress on that young brow
Was damp with dews of deatlh;
And glassier grew her upraised eye
With every tlutteding breath.
Coldly her slender fingers lay
Within the mourner's grasp;
Lightly they pressed that fostering hand,
And stiffened in its grasp.
Then low the mother bent her knee,
And cried in fervent prayer"Hear me, O God I mine own, my child,
Oh, holy Father, spare I
My loved, my last, mine only oneTear her not yet away:
Leave this crushed heart its best, sole Joy
Be meret~fn, I pray!"

Though fixed in death her eye;
A smile had met the angel's kiss
That stole her parting sigh I
And round her cold lips sitll that smile
A holy brightness shed,
As though she joyed her sinless soul
To Him who gave had fled.
The mother clasped her senseless form,
And shrieked in wild despair,
And kissed the icy lips and cheek,
And touched the dewy hair.
"N o warmth-no life-my child, my ebild I

One murmur of that lute-like voice,

Spare me, in pity spare this blow  
All else I can endure.
Take hope, take peace, this blighted head
Strike with thy heaviest rod;
But leave me this, thy sweetest boon,
Give back my child, 0 God I"
The suppliant ceased; her tears were stayed;
Hushed were those wailings loud;
A hallowed peace crept o'er her soul;
Her head to earth was bowed
Low as her knee; for as she knelt,
About her. lo I a flood
Of soft, celestial lustre fellA form beside her stood.
And slowly then her awe-struck face
And frighted eyes she raised;
Her heart leaped high: those clouded orbs
Grew brighter as she gazed;
For oh I they rested on a shape
Majestic-yet so mild,
Imperial dignity seemed blent
With sweetness of a child.
It spske not, but that saeinike  di
Was full of mery's light,
And power and pity from thoe

CHARACTERIt ICS OP 8iHAEKPEARE.--CLsLYLz.
SITAXSPEARE, we may say, embodies for us the outer life of
our Europe as developed in the middle ages. Its chivalries,
courtesies, humors, ambitions, what practictl way of thinking, acting, looking at the world men then had. Just when that chivalry way of life had reachled its last finish, and was on the point
of breaking down into slow or soft dissolution, as we now see
it everywhere, this sovereign poet, with his seeing eye, with his
perennial singing voice, was sent to take note of it, to give longenduring record of it.
Of this Shakspeare of ours, perlhaps the opinion one sometimes hears a little idolatrously cxpressed is, in fact, the right
one; I think the best judgmenlt, not of this country only, but
of Etrope at large, is slowly pointing to the conclusion, that
Shakspeare is the chief of all poets hitberto; the greatest intellect who, in our recorded world, has left record of himrself in the
way of literature.  On the whole, I know not such a power of
vision, such a faculty of thoulrht, if we take all the characters
of it, in any other man. Such a calmlness of depth; placid
joyous strength; all tlings imaged in that great soul of his so
true and clear, as in a tranquil unfathomable sea!  It has been
said, that in the constructing of Shakspeare's dramas, there is,
apart from all other " faculties," as thev are called, an understanding manifested, equal to that in Bacon's iortnm Oryanunm.
That is true; and it is not a truth that strikes every one. It
would become more apparent if we tried, any of us for himself,
how, out of Shakspeare's dramatic materials, we could fashion
such a result!  The built house seems all so fit-every way as
it ihould be, as if it came there by its own law and the nature
of things, we forget the rude disorderly quarry it was shaped
from. the very perfection of the houlse, as if ntature herself had
nmade it, hides the builder's merit.  Perfect, more perfect than
any other man, we may call Shakspeare in this: he discerns,
knIows as by instinct, what condition he works under, what his
materials are, what his own force and its relation to them is. It
is not a transitory glance of insight that will suffice; it is deliberate illumnination of the whole matter; it is a calmlv seei'ng eye;
a great intellect, in short.
Or indeed we may say again, it is in what I called portrait
painting, delineating of men and things, especially of men, that
8hakspeare is great. All the greatness of the man com -s orut
846THE LADIES' READ)ER.
decisively here.  It is unexampled, I thinlk, that calm creative
perspicacity of Shliakspeare.  The tling lie looks at reveals not
this or that face of it, but its inmost heart anti generie secret:
it dissolves itself as in lighlt before him, so that he discernls the
perfect structure of it.  Creative, we said: poetic creation,
what is tlhis too but acein! tile thing sufficiently  Th'le we rd
that will describe the thing, follows of itself firom suclh clear
intense sight of the thlinlg.  And( is not Shakspeare's morality,
his valor, candor, tolerance, truthfulness; his whole victorious
strength and greatness, which call triumph over such obstruCtions, visible there too I Great as the world! No twIisted, poor
convex-concave mnirror, reflecting all objects with its own convexities and concavities; a pertectly level mirror; that is to say
withal, if we will understand it, a man justly relateld to all things
and men, a good man.    It is truly a lordly spe'tacle llow this
great soul takes in all kilnds of tmen and objects, a Falstaff, anii
Othello, a Juliet, a Coriolanus; sets them all tbrthl to us in their
rolund colpFlletenless; loving, just, the equal brother of all.
If I say that Shakspeare is tile greatest of intellects, I have
said all concerning himn.  But there is more in Sliakspeare's
intellect than we have yet seen. It is what I call ai uncon.scious
intellect; thiere is more virtue itn it than  e he imself is aware
of. Novalis beautifully remarks of hinm, that those dramas of
his are products of nature too, deep as nature herself.  I find a
great truth in this saying.  Shakspeare's art is not artifice; the
noblest worth of it is not there by plan or precontrivance. It
grows up from the deeps of nature, through this noble sincere
sotil, who is a voice of nature.  The latest generations of tmen
will find new meanings in Sbakspeare, new elucidations of their
own human being; "new harmonies with the infinite structure
of the Universe; concurreinces with later ideas, affinities with
the higher powers and senses of man."    This well deserves
meditating.  It is nattre's highest reward to a true simple great
soul, that he get thus to be a part qf herself.  Such a man's
works, whiatsoever he with utmost conscious exertion and forethought shall accomplish, grow up withal unconsciously, from
the unknown deeps in him:--as the oak-tree grows from the
earth's bosom, as the mountains and waters shape themselves;
with a symmetry grounded on nature's own laws, conformable
to all tnrth whatsoever.  How much in Shakspeare lies hid;
his sorrows, his silent struggles known to himself; much that
was not known at all, not speakable at all: like roots, like sap
and forces working under ground! Speech is great; but silence
i':renter.

THE SKELTN CAVE--WILLIAM CtLL!N BaTANT.
[The characters of Tshe Skeleton's Cave, are Father Ambrose, an aged
Catholic priest; Le MNire, a gay sportsman of French origin; and his
niece, a young Anglo-American.]
The ecclesiastic had taken the hat from  his brow that he
might enjov the breeze which played lightly about the cliffs;
and the coolness of which was doubly grateful after the toil of
the ascent. In doing this lhe uncovered a highl atnd ample forehead, suchi as artists love to couple with the features of old age,
when they would represent a countenance at once noble and venerable. This is the only feature of the human face which Time
spares; he dims the lustre of the eye; he shrivels the cheek,
he destroys the firm  or sweet expression of the mouttl; he
thins and whitens the hairs; but the forehead, that temple of
thought, is beyond the reach, or rather, shows more grand and
lofty for the ravages which surround it.
The two persons whom he addressed were much younger.
One of them    was in the prime of manhlood and personal
strength, rather tall, and of a vigorous make. lie wore a hunting-cap, from the lower edge of which curled a profusion of
strong dark hair, rather too long for the usual mode in the Atlantic states, shading a fresh-colored countenance, lighted by a
pair of full black eyes, the expression of which was compounded of boldness and good-humor.   His dress was a blue frockcoat trimmed with yellow fringe, and bound by a sash at the
waist, deer-skin pantaloons, and deer-skin moccasins. He carried a short rifle on his left shoulder; and wore on his left side
a leathern bag of rather ample dimensions, and on his right a
powder-flask. It was evident that he was either a hunter by
occutpation, or at least one who made hunting his prin ipal
amusemllent; alnd there was something in his air and the neatness of his garb and equipments that bespoke the latter.

the lofty growth, and the magnificence and variety of foliage
which distinguish the American forests, so much  the admiration of those who have seen only the groves of Europe.
As the three went forward they passed through a heap
of dry leaves lighltly piled, which tlhe winds of the  last
autumn had blown into the cave from the summit of the
surrounding forest and the rustling made by their steps sounded strangely loud amnid that death-like silence.  A spacious
cavern presented itself to their sight, the roof of whith near

witlh thle darkless, but the flaite did not reveal the I'ace of the

On reaching again the mouth of the catve, they were struck
withl the  change in the aspect of thle hleavens. Dark heavy
clouds, the rouIlll sumnilits of whichl were seen one beyond thu
otlier, were rapidly rising in the west; and through the grayish blue haze w\lich suffuised thie sky before them, the sun
appeared already shorn of his beams. A sound was leard afar
of miligltv wiinds coinltelding witlh tle forest, andX the thluntler
rolled at a dista:llce.

clitffs.  Le us w\;tch it fi'oml1 wh'ere we stand above the tops of

Emliily, thoigil she wouild,ladlv lhave left the cave, co1uld say
nothing agrainst the propriety of this advice; and even Le

well-loaded table tat that moenictllt than all tlhe storms that ever

atteml)tiig a descent. In a few moments thle dark array of
cloulds swept over the f;ace of thle sunI, and a tumult in the
woods announced the co,nitlrg of tlhe blast.  The sulmmits of
the firest waved mand stooped before it, like a field of young flax
in the stummer breeze--anotlIer and fiercer gust descendedanother and strongrer convulsion of the forest ensued.  The
trees rocked backward and forward, leaned andl rose, and tossed

air above thelm was filled witlh their leafy spoils.  The roar was
tremendous-the noise of the ocean in a teCilpest is not loutder
-it seemed as ift' tllat innumerable mnultitude of giantts of the
wood raised a universal voice of wailinlg under the fuiry that
smote and tormented themn.  At length the rain began to fall,
first in large and rare drops, and then thunder burst over head,
and the waters of the firmamemnt poured down in torrents, and
the blast that hlowled in the woods fleld before them  as if from
an element that it feared. The trees again stood erect, and
nothing was lheard but the rain beating Iceavily on the immense
canopy of leaves arounfl, and the occa-ional crashings of the
thundler, accompatied tby flshes of liglltlning, that tlhrew  a

the base of the precipice.
A gust of winld drove the rain into the opening where they
stood, and obliged them to retire farther withlin. The priest
suggested that thiey should take this opportunity to exalnine
thiat part of thle cave whicel, itn going to the skeleton's cllatnber, they lhad passed on1 tlleir left, o)bserving, however, that lie believed it wa.s no otherwise remarkable tllhan thr its narrowness anrd
its length.  Le Maire and Emily assenlted, and the former taking Ilp the torch wllich lie lhad sttuck in thle ground, they went
ba,ck into the interior. Theyv had jllst reached the spot wltere thle
two passagles divergedf   from each other, wlIen a hideous and
intense gltare of liglht filled the c.avern, showing for an instant
the walls, the the  of, the floor, and every crag and recess, with
the distinctness of the( broadest sunshine.  A  frightful crash
accompanied it, consisting of several sharp and deafening explosions, as if the very lheart of the imountain was reilt asutnder bIy
the lightning, anld immediately after a body of immense weight
seemled to fall at their very feet with a heavy sounld, and a
shock that caused the place where they stood to tremble as if
shaken by an earthquake.   A strong blast of air rushed by
them, and a suffocating odor filled the cavern.
Fatlher Ambrose had fallen upon hiis knees in mental prayer,
at the explosion; but the blast from the mouth of the cavern
threw himn to the earth.  lie raised himself, however, immediately, and found hiimself in utter silence and darkness, save that
a livid image of that insuifferable glare floated vet before his
eyeballs. tIe called first upon Emily, who did not answer, then
upon Le Maire, who replied from the ground a few paces nearer the entrance of the cave. He also had been thrown prostrate, and the torch he carried was extinguished. It was but
the work of an instant to kindle it again, and they then discovered Emily extended near them in a swoon.
" Let us bear her to the mouth of the cavern," said Le'Maire;
"the fresh air from without will revive her."  He took ler in
his arms, but on nrriving at the spot he placed her suddenly on
the grotiund, and raising both hands, exclaimed, with an accent
of despair, l"The rock is fallen!-the entrance is closed "  It
was but too evident-Fatlher Ambrose needed but a single look

to convince him of its trnth-the huge rock which impended
over the entrance hlad been loosened by the tllunderbolt, and
had fallen upon the floor of the cave, closing all return to the
outer world.
On the third dav the cavern presented a nmore gloomy spectacle than it had done at any time since the fall of the rock
took place. It was now about eleven o'clock in the morning,
and the shrill singing of the wind about the cliffs, and through
the crevice, which now acllnitted a dimmer light than on the
day previous, announced the approach of a storm from the
south. Thle hope of relief from without was growing fainter
and fainter as the time passed on; and the sufferings of the
prisoners became mnore poignant.
In the meantime the light from the aperture grew dimmer
and dimmer, and the eves of the prisoners, though accustomed
to the twilight of the cavern, becamne at length unable to distinguish objects at a few paces from the entrance. The priest
and Le Maire had placed themselves by the couch of Emily,
btut rather, as it seemed, from that instinct of our race which
leads us to seek each other's presence, than for any purpose of
conversation, for each of the party preserved a gloomy silence.
The topics of speculation on their condition had been discussed
to weariness, aud no others had now any interest for their
minds. It was no unwelcome interruption to that melancholy
siltence, when they heard the sound of a miglhty rain pouring
down upon the leafy summits of the woods, and beating against
the naked walls and shelves of the precipice. The roar grew
more and more distinct, and at length it seemed that they could
distinguish a sort of shuddering of the earth above them, as if
a    mighty host was marching heavily over it. The sense of
suffering was for a moment suspended in a feeling of awe and
curiosity.
" That, likewise, is the rain," said Father Ambrose, after liFtening for a moment  "The clouds must pour down a perfect
cataract, when the weight of its fall is thus felt in the heart of
the rock."
UDo you hear that noise of running water f" asked Emily,
whose quick ear had distinguished the rush of the stream
formed y the collected rains over the rocks without at the
mouth of the cave.
"Would that its channel were through this cavern," exclaimed
Le Maire, starting up. " Ah I! here we have it-we have it!listen to the dropping of water from the roof near the entrance.MtD U LA TIO.N.

As I wais on a jolrney late, a mental one I mean,
Around.his mighty world of ours, I came upon a scene
Was so astoniLshing to see, so comic, grave, and grand,
I took my note book out with haste and clambered to a stand
Upon a heap of broken wares, a motley pile of things,
That seemed they might have once belonged to some old race of kings;
And heaps on heaps were strewn about, as far as eye could scan,
Around the fields, along the streams where e'er the vision ran;
As if some ruthless creditor had levied on the world,
And kingdoms, thrones, and diadems, were all to ruin hurled;
Ill-gotten chattles of tlhe powers that were compelled to " fail,"
And were ah brought together there for one stupendous sale I
Stood side by side the vassal-bot, and they of proudest birth;
No more a slave, no more a lord, in all Republic earth.

Rich harvests waited but a word, to burst the teeming ground;

THE STORM-SHIIP.-WAsmeGTron IavING,
Is the golden age of the province of the New         Netherlands,
when under the sway of W\ollter Van Twiller, otherwise called
the Doubter, the people of the Malihattoes were alarmed one
sultry afternoon, just about the time of the sutmmer solstice, by
a tremendous storm      of thulnder an(d lightning.    The rain fell
in such torrents as absolutely to spatter up and smoke along
the ground.    It seemed ai if the thunder rattled and rolled
over the very roofs of the houses; the lightning was seen toTIlE LAEDIW' READER.
play about the church of St. Nicholas, and to strive three
times, in vaill, to strike its weathercock. Garret Van Horne's
new chimney was split almost from top to bottom; atnd Doffue
Mildeberger was struck speechless froi his bald-faced mare,just
as he was riditng into town. In a word, it was one of those unparalleled storms which only happen once within the memory of
that venerable personage, known in all towns by the appellation
of "the oldest inhabitant."
Great was the terror of the good old women of the Manhattoes. They gathered their children together, and took refuge in thle cellars, after having hlung a shoe on the iron point
of every bed-post, lest it shoul(l attract the lightning.  At
length the storm abated; the thunder sank inlto a growl; and
the settinlg sun, breaking fro;m under the fringed borders of the
cloulds, mallcle the broad bosomi of the bay to gleam like a sea of
molten goldl.
The word was given firom the fort that a ship was standing
up the bay. It passed from mnoutll to mouth, and street to
street, and soon put the little capital in a bustle. The arrival
of a ship, in those early tivmes of the settlement, was an event
of vast imiportance to the inhabitants. It brought them news
fromn the old world, fromn the land of their birth, from which
they were so completely severed: to the yearlv ship, too, they
looked for their supply of luxuries, of finery, of comlforts, and
almost of necessaries. The good vrouw coul(d not have her new
cap nor new gown until the arrival of the ship; the artist waited
for it for hiis tools, the burgomaster for his pipe and his supply
of llolltnds, the schoolboy fir his top and marbles, and the lordly
landholder for the bricks with which he was to build his new
mansion. Thus every one, rich and poor, great and small, looked
oult for the arrival of the shlip. It was the great yearly event of
the town of New Amsterdanm; and from one end of the year to
the other, the ship-the sllip-the ship-was the continual
topic of conversation.
The news from the fort, therefore, brought all the populace
down to the battery, to behold the wished-for sight. It was
not exactly the time when she had been expected to arrive, and
the circumstance was a matter of some speculation. Manv wvere
the groups collected about the battery. Here and there might
b)e seen a burgonuaster, of slow and pompous gravity, giving his
opillion with great confidence to a crowd of old womnen and idle
)oys. At another place was a knot of old weather-beaten fellows who hadt been seamen or fishermen in their times, and

were tgreat authorities on such occasions; thiese gave different
opinions, auld caused great lispultes amlong their several adhercllts: but the man most looked up to, and followed and watched
by the crowd was Ilans Vanll Pelt, an old Dutch sea captain re-'
tired from service, the nautical oracle of the place.  le recoiinnoitred the ship through an ancient telescope, covered witdh'
tarry canvas, hummed a Dutch tune to himself, and said
nothing. A hum, however, from Hans Van Pelt, had always
more weight with the public than a speech from another man.
In the Ineantime the ship becalme more distinct to the naked
eve: she was a stout, rountd, Dutch-built vessel, with hIigh bow
anld poop, anil bearing Jiltch colors. The eveling sun gildled
hler bellying canvals as she came riding over the lontg wavilng
billows. The sentinel, wlho lhad given notice of lier alp)roach,
declared, that he first got sight of her whell slie was in tile
centre of the bay; and that she broke suddenly on Ihis siglht,
just as if she had come out of the bosom of the black tlllhun,ler-loud. The bystanders looked at Hans Van Pelt, to see what
lie would say to this report: Hans Van Pelt screwed his Iloutlh
closer together and said nothing; upon which some shook thleir
hleads, and others shrugged their shoulders.
The ship was now repeatedly hailed, but made no reply, and
passing by the fort, stood on up the Hudson. A gun was
brought to bear on her, and with some difficulty, loaided and
fired by Hans Van Pelt, the garrison not being expert in artillery. The shot seemed absolutely to pass through the shlip, and
to skip along the water on the other side, but no notice was taken
of it!  What was strange, she had all her sails set, and sailed
right against wind and tide, which were both down the river.
Upon this Hans Van Pelt, who was likewise harbor-master, ordered his boat, and set off to board her; but after rowing two
or three hours, he returned without success. Sometimes he
would get within one or two hulndred yards of her, and then,
in a twinkling, she would be half a mile off. Some said it was
because his oarsmen, who were rather pursy and short-winded,
stopped every now and then to take breath, and spit on their
hands; but this it is probable was a mere scandal. He got
near enough, however, to see the crew; who were all dressed in
the Dutch style, the officers in doublets and high hats and
feathers; not a word was spoken by any one on board; they
stood as motionless as so many statues, and the ship seemeld as
if left to her own government. Thus she kept on, away up the
river, lessening and lessening in the evening sunshin,:, until she:i 6 73f;8

MODULAT10ION.TiE LADIES' READER.
in these highlands in storms, which are considered as connected witlh the old story of the ship. The captains of the river
craft talk of a little bulbous-bottomed Dutch goblin, in trunk
hose and sugar-loafed hat, with a speaking trumpet in his
hand, which they say keeps the Duunderberg. They declare
that they have heard him, in stormy weather, in the imidst of
the turmoil, giving orders in low Dutch, for the piping up of a
fresh gust of wind, or the rattling off of another thunder-clap.
That sometimes he has been seen surrounded by a crew of little imps, in broad clothes and short doublets, tumbling head
over heels in the rack and mist, and playing a thousand ganmbols iu the air, or buzzing like a swarm of flies about Antonv's
nose; and that, at such times, the hurry-scurry of the storm
was always greatest. One timne a sloop, in passing by the
Dunderberg, was overtaken by a thunder-gust, that came
scouring round the mountain, and seelmed to barst just over the
vessel. Though tight and well ballhited, she labored dreadfully, and the water came over the gunvwale. All the crew
were amazed, when it was discovered that there was a little
white sugar-loaf hat on the mast head, known at once to be
the hat of the Heer of the Dunderberg. Nobody, however,
dared to climb to the mast-head, and get rid of this terrible
hat.  The sloop continued laboring and rocking, as if she
would have rolled her mast overboard, and seemed in continual
danger either of upsetting, or of running on shore. In this
way sle drove quite through the HiglTands, until she had
passed Pollopol's Island, where, it is said, the jurisdiction of the
Dunderberg potentate ceases. No sooner had she passed this
bourne, than the little hat spun up into the air, like a top,
whirled up all the clouds into a vortex, and hurried them back
to the summit of the Dunlderberg, while the sloop righted herself, and sailed on as quietly as if in a mill-pond. Nothing
saved her from utter wreck, but the fortunate circumstance of
having a horse-shoe nailed against the mast, a wise precaution
against evil spirits, since adopted by all the Dutch captains that
navigate this haunted river.
There is another story told of this foul-weather urchin, by
Skipper Daniel Ouslesticker, of Fishkill, who was never known
to tell a lie. He declared that, in a severe squall, be saw him
seated astride of his bowsprit, riding the sloop ashore, full butt
against Antony's nose, and that he was exorcised by Dominic
V`an Gieson, of Esopus, who happened to be on board, and wllo
sang the hymn of St. Nicholas, wlereupon the goblin threw

carlrying away with him the nighrtcap of thle Dominic's wife,
whlich wa;s discovered the next Sunday morning lhallging on
the weathercock of Esopus chlurch steeple, at least forty miles
otl:  Sevcral events of this kind having taken place, the regular skippers of the river, for a long time, did not venture to
pass the Dunderberg without lowering their petks, out of
I(.lnage to the Hleer of the mountain, and it was observed that
ll stlch as paid this tribute of respect were suffered to pass
unmo-lested.
"'Such," said Antony Vander Hleyden, "are a few of the
stories written down by Selyne the poet, concerning this stormship; wlhich he affirm~ns to have brought a crew of mischievous
imlps irlto the province, from some old ghost-ridden country of
Europe. I could give you a host mnore, if necessary; for all
the accidents that so often befall the river craft in the 1Higllands
are said to be tricks played off by these imps of the Dunderberg; but I see that you are nodding, so let us turn in for the
night."

-TIE LAST PLAGUE OF EO1YPT.--RZ. A. CLEVLAWND CoXZ.
Deep nlight o'er thr waters, thou dark-rolling Nile,
And tlhe lIebrew sleeps trel bling, hlis lord witlh a smile,
For a voice cotmes in dreatms  tho t  chlildren of God:
But the proud have no whlisper that Death is tbroad!
So, nestled in rocks, whetn tle wllirlwind is nigh,
The- heIar its flr cornillg-t1he birds of the skyl
\'liil e trees it must slliver il leaf atid in forin,
Are hush is the stillllesS that heralds the storm.
And the temnlphian, at imidnighlt, lay smiling and pleased,
His sin all unatlrivetn, his Cod uitappeas'd,
Till o'er liis d;irk slumbers chill sl'hldaows were ciurl'd,
And tlle soul of the dreamer was far from tlhe world.
And he lay in the coils of the dlenathspirit, mute,
With a seal on Ihis lips, like the 1blast in tili fruit;
And he seem'd as wlien hoar frost lathl stiffen'd the flower'Twas the blight of the Lord,'twas tlhe touch of his power.
But still was the starlillt, wllile shrouded and hid,
Death brooded o'er pliltace and cold pyramid;
No voice on the midight: t;o larum of wrath;
No sound of the whirlwinid-but only its path.
And a cry was in Egypt, when rose the red morn,
For a thou.sand pale mothers bewail'd their first born;
And Memnon's sweet music that greeted tho Sun
Was lost in the moan of a nation undone.
And shriek'd the young  ifero o'er the child of her pain,
That never should breathe on her bosom again,
And breasts that were warm with their nursling before,
But heaved, in her grief, for the boy that she bore.
And the bride shrunk aghast, like the death-stricken dove,
When she woke in the cold frozen lock of her love;
And a groan for the noble, the lovely outpour'd,
A wail for tie battle they waged with the Lord.
And they wem'd like the willows, that, left on the steep,
Are bent o'er the wreck of the forest to weep,
Or liltes that dripping, and drooping of form,
Shed tears o'er the broken, the spoil of the storm.
Ye join not the wailing, ye dwellers of Zan  
Hath the death-angel spared ye, that smote as he ran?
Oh, the blood-sprinkled lintel liath stayed his proud reign,
And wateh'd at your threshold the Lamb that was slain.

RETURN OP THE WEPT OF WISH-TON-WISH.--JAxM FIMimoRz CooRPL
The movement of the timid hare is scarce more hurried, or
more undecided, than that of the creature who now suddenly
presented herself to the warriors. It was apparent, by the
hesitating and half-retreating step that succeeded the light
bound with which she catne in view, that she dreaded to advance, while she knew not how far it might be proper to retire. For the first moiment, slhe stood in a suspended and
doubting posture, such as one mnigllt suppose a creatuire of mist
would assume ere it vanrished, and then niieting the eve of Conanchet, the uplifted foot retouchled the eartlh, and iher whole
formi sunk into the mnodest and shrinking attitude of an Indian
girl, who stood in the presence of a Sachemn of her tribe. As
this female is to enact no tnean part in that which follows, the
reader tnay be thiankful for a more mlinutte description of her
person.
The age of the stranger was under twenty. In form she
rose above the usual stature of an Indian lmaild, though the
proportions of her person were as light and buoyant as at all
comiported with the fullness that properly belonjged to her
years. The limbs, seen below the folds of a short kirtle of bright
scarlet cloth, were just and tapering, even to the nicest proportions of classic beauty; and never did foot of higher instep,
and softer roundness, grace a feathered moccason. Thoughl the
person, from the neck to the knees, was hid by a tightly-fitting
vest of calico and the short kirtle named, enough of the shape
was visible to betray outlines that had never been injured,
either by the mistaken devices of art or by the baneful etfects
of toil. The skin was only visible at the hands, face, and neck.
Its lustre having been a little dimmed by exposure, a rich, rosv
titnt had usurped the natural brightness of a complexion that
had once been fair even to brilliancy. The eve was fuill, sweet,
and of a blue that emulated the sky of evening; the brows,
soft and arched; the nose, straight, delicate, and slighltly Grecian; the forehead, fuller than that which properly belonged to
a girl of the Narralansetts, but regular, delicate, and polished;
and the hair, instead of dropping in long straight tresses of jet
black, broke out of the restraints of a band of beaded wampum, in ringlets of golden yellow.
The peculiarities that distinguished this female from tho
37tTIHE LADIES' READER.
others of her tribe, were not confined alone to the indelible
marks of nature. Her step was more elastic; her gait more
erect and graceful; her foot less inwardly inclined, and her
whole movements freer and more decided than those of a race
doomed from infancy to subjection and labor. Though ornamented by somlle of the prized inventions of the hated raco
to w-lhich she evidently owed her birth, she had the wild and
timid look of those with whom  she had grown into womanhood. Ier beaulty would have been remarkable in any region of the eartll, while the play of muscle, the ingenuous
beaming of the eye, anld the freedom of limb and action, were
such as seldom p;ss beyond the years of childhood, among
people who, in attelnpting to improve, so often mar the works
of znature.
"Wh y has Conanchet sent for a woman from the woods I"
"Narra-mattah, come near;" returned  the young chief,
changing the deep and proud tones in which he had addressed
his restless and bold companion in arms, to those which better
suited the gentle ear for which his words were intended. " Fear
not, daughter of the morning, for those around us are of a race
used to see women at the coulncil-fires. Now look, with an open
eye-is there anythilng among these trees that seemetl like an
ancient tradition?  Hast ever beheld such a valley, in thy
dreams? Have yonder Pale-faces, whom the tomahawks of my
young men spared, been led before thee by the Great Spirit, in
the dark night?"
The female listened, in deep attention. Her gaze was wild
and uncertain, and yet it was not absolutely without gleamings
of a half-reviving intelligence. Until that moment. she had
been too much occupied in conjecturing the subject of her visit
to regard the natural objects by'which she was surrounded:
but with her attention thus directly turned upon them, her organs of sight embraced each and all, with the discrimination
that is so remarkatfef in those whose faculties are quickened by
danger and necessity. Passing from side to side, her swift
glances ran over the distant hamlet, with its little fort; the
bluildings in the near grounds; the soft and verdant fields; the
fragrant orchard, beneath whose leafy shades she stood, and the
blackened tower, that rose in its centre, like some gloomy memorial, placed there to remind the spectator not to trust too
fondly to the signs of peace and loveliness that reigned around.
Shaking back the ringlets that lhad blown about her temples,
375THE LADIES' READER.
the wondering female returned thoughtfully and in silence to
her place.
"'Tis a village of the Yengeese!" she said, after a long and
expressive pause. " A Narragansett woman does not love to
look at the lodges of the hated race."
"Listen.-Lies have never entered the ears of Narra-mattah.
My tongue hath spoken like the tongue "of a chief. Thou didst
not come of the sumach, but of the snow. This hand of thine
is not like the hands of the women of my tribe; it is little,
for the Great Spirit did not make it for work; it is of the color
of the sky in the morning, for thy fathers were born near the
place where the sun rises. Thy blood is like spring water. All
this thou knowest, for none have spoken false in thy ear.
Speak--dost thou never see the wigwam of thy father? Does
not his vani-e whisper to thee, in the language of his people?"
The female stood in the attitude which a sibyl might be supposed to assume, while listening to tlhe occult mlandates of the
mysterious oracle, everyfaculty entlancecl ancd atteative.

knows what she knows; he sees'vli,ut s'le sees; his mind is her
mind. If the Great Spirit madle l:her1 kiln of a different color,
he made her heart the same. Narra-mattah l will not listen to
the lying language; she shuts her ears, ior tlhere is deceit in its
sounds. She tries to forget it. One tong'te can say all she
wishes to speak to Conanchet; why shoicl she look back in
dreams, when a great chief is lher husbandm?"
The eye of the warrior, as he looked upoIn the ingenuous
and confiding face of the speaker, was kind to fondness. The
firmness had passed away, and in its place was left the winning
softness of affection, whiclh, as it belongs to nature, is seen, at
times, in the expression of an Indian's eye, as strongly as it is
ever known to sweeten the intercourse of a more polished condition of life.
"Girl," he said with emphasis, after a ni{oment of thought,
as if he would recall her and himself to more important duties,' this is a war-path; all on it are men. Thou wast like the pigeon before its wing opens, when I brought thee from the nest;
still the winds of many winters had blowtn upon thee. Dost
never think of the warmth and of the food of the lodge in which

She does not tell how a young Narragansett should obey her
husband, nor how the woman must keep food in the lodges for
the hunters that are wearied; her tongue useth strange words.
It namnes a mighty and just Spirit; it telleth of peace and not
of war; it soundeth as one talking from the clouds; it is like
the falling of the water among rocks. Narra-mattah loves to
listen, for the words seem to her like the Wish-Ton-Wish,
when he whistles in the woods."
Conanchet had fastened a look of deep and affectionate
interest on the wild and sweet countenance of the being who
stood before him. She had spoken in that attitude of earnest
an(d natural eloquence that ino art can equal; anld when she
ceased, he laid a hand, in kind but melancholy fondness, on
the half-inclined and motionless head, as he answered:
"This is the bird of night singing to its young! The Great
Spirit of thy fathers is angry, that tlhout livest in the lodge of a
Narragansett. His sighlt is too cunning to be cheated. He
knows that the moccasin, andi the wasmpuln, and the robe of
fur are liars; he sees the color of the skin beneatlh."'Conanchet, no'" returnled the female hurriedly, and with
a decision her timiditv did not give reason to expect. "lie
seeth fuirther than the skin, antd knoweth the color of the imind.
He hath forgotten that one of his girls is missing."
"It is not so. The eagle of my people was taken into the
lodges of the pale faces. lie was young, and they taught him
to sing with another tongue. The colors of his feathe rs were
changed, and they thought to cheat the Manitou. But when
the door was open, he spread his wings and flew back to his
nest. It is not so.  What hath been done is good, and
what will be done is better. Come, there is a straight path
before us."
Thus saying, Conanchet motioned to his wife to follow
toward the group of captives. The foregoing dialogue had
occurred in a place where the two parties were partially concealed from each other by the ruin; but as the distance was so
trifling, the Sacbem and his comupanion were soon confronted
with those he sought. Lenvilg his wife a little without the
circle, Conanchet advanced, and taking the unresisting and
half-unconscious Ruth by the arm, he led her forward. Ile
placed the two females in attitudes where each might look tlhe
other full in the face. Strong emotion struggled in a couIntenance, which, in spite of its fierce mask of war-paint, couldi
not entirely concenal its workings.

"See," he said in English, looking earnestly from one to the
other.  " The Good Spirit is not aslhamed of his work. What
he hath done, he hath done; Narra,ansett nor Yengeese can
alter it. This is the white bird that came from the sea," lihe
added, touching the shoulder of Ruthl lightly with a finger,
"and this the yotng, tllat shei warnmed unider lier wing."
Then, folding his armls oin his naked breast, he appeared to
summon his energy, lest, in the scene that he knew   must
follow, his manhood might be betrayed into some act unworthy of his name.
The captives were necessarily ignorant of the meaning of the
scene whichl they had just witnessedf. So, mlany strange and
savage-lo,oking forllts were constantly passing andl repassinlg
before their eyes, that the arrival of one more or less was not
likely to be noted. Until she heard Conanchet speak in her
native tongue, Ruth lhad lent no attention to the interview
between him and his wife. Biut the figurative languatge and
no less remarkable action of the Narraganlsett had the effect to
arouse her suddenly, and in the most exciting manner, from
her melancholy.
No childl of tender age ever unexpecetedly catme before the
eves of Rulth Heathcote, witiout painfilly recalliing tlhe image
of the clherub she had lost. The playfill voice of itnfancy never
surprised her ear, withlout the sound conveying a pang to the
heart; nor cotuld allusion, ever so remlote, be made to persons
or events that bore resemllblance to the sad incidents of her
own life, without quickeni)ng the never-dying pullses of maternal love. No wonder, then, that when she found lherself in the
situation and under the cireclnlstances described, nature grew
stronlg within her, and that her mind caught glimpses, however
dim and indistinct they mighlt be, of' a truth that the reader
has alrealdy anticipated. Still, a certain and intelligible clite
was wanlting. Fancy lhad ever painted her child in the innocence and infancy in wlich it had been torn from lter armis;
and here, wlhile there was so much to correspond with reasonable expectation, there was little to answer to the long and
fondly cherished picture. The delusion, if so holy and natural
a feeling may thus be termed, had been too deeply seated to
be dispossessed at a glance. Gazing lotng, earnestly, and with
features that varied with every chatlging feeling, she held the
stranger at the length of her two arms, alike unwilling to
release her hold, or to adlmit hler closer to a heart which might
rightfilly be the property of another.

TIIE SABBATT IN 1NE-W NE G I.ANI).-Ms8 BsDowl-xc.
The observancte'f the Sabbath began witlh the ])uritanls, as
it still does with a great portion of their descendants, on Saturday night. At the going down of the sun on Saturday, all
temlporal affairs were suspended; and so zealouslv did our
fathers maintain the letter, as well as the spirit of the law, that,
according to a vulgar tradition in Connecticut, no beer was
brewed in tile latter part of the week, lest it slhould presume to
work on Sun,day.
It must be confessed, that the tendency of the age is to
laxity; and so rapidly is the wholesome strictnlless of primitive
times abating, th;at, should some antiquary, fifty years lletee, in
exploring lhis garret rubblish, chance to cast his eye on our
humble pages, he may be surprised to learn, that, even now,
the Sabbath is observed, in the interior of New England, with

On Saturday afternoon an uncommon b ustle is apparent.
The greait class of pl)ocrastinators are Ihurryilng to and fro to
coinplhte thle lagging btusiness of the week. The good mothers, like Burns' matrons, are plying the needle, making "' anldl
claes look amaist as weel's the new;" while the domestics, or
help, (we prefer the national descriptive terni), are wielding,
witlh might and main, their brooms and mops, to make all tidty
for the sabbath.
As the day declines, the hum of labor dies away, and after
the sun is set, perfect stillness reigns in every well ordered household, and not a foot-fall is heard in the village street.  It cannot be denied, that even the most scriptural, missing tlle excitement of their ordinary occulpations, anticipate their uisual bed
tiime. The obvious inference from this fact is skillfillv avoided
by certain ingenious reasoners, who alletge, that the constitution
was originally so organized as to require an extra quantity of
sleep on every seventh night. We recommend it to the curious to inquire, how this peculiarity was adjusted, when the first
day of the week was changed from Saturday to Sunday.
The Sabbath morning is as peaceful as the first hallowed day
Not a human sound is heard without the dwellingf, and, but

theinr measured steps to the mceeting-house;-the families of the
mitinister, the squire, the doctor, the mnerchant, the modest gentriy of the village, and the mecllanic and laborer, all. arrayed in
their best, all imneeting on even ground, and all with that consciousness of independence and equality, which breaks down
the pride of the rich, and rescues the poor fonom servility, envy,
and discontent. If a morning salutation is reciprocated, it is
in a suppressed voice; and if, perchance, nature, in somle reckless urchin; burst forth in laughter-" My dear, you forget it's
Sunday," is the ever ready reproof.
Though every face wears a solemn aspect, yet we once chanced
to see even a deacon's muscles relaxed by-the wit of a neighbor,
and heard him allege in a half-deprecating, half-laughing voice,
"The squire is so droll, that a body must laugh, though it be
Sabbath-day."
The farmer's ample wagon, and the little one-horse vehicle,
bring in all who reside at an inconvenient walking distancethat is to sav, in our riding community, half a mile from the
church. It is a pleasilng sioght, to those who love to note the
happy peculiarities of their own land, to see the farmers'
daughters, blooming, intelligent, well-bred, pouring ott of these
hotmely coaches, with their nice white gowns, prunel shoes,
Leghorn hats, fans and parasols, and the spruce young men,
with their plaited ruffles, blue coats, and vellow buttons. The
whole community meet as one religious family, to offer their
devotions at the common altar. If there is an outlaw firom the
society--a luckless wight, whose vagrant taste has never been
subdued-he may be seen stealing along the margin of some
little brook, far away firom the condemning observation and
troublesome admonition of his fellows.
Toward the close of the day, (or to borrow a phrase descriptive of his feelings, who first used it), "whenl the Sabbath
begins to abate," the children cluster about the windows.
Their eyes swander from their catechism  to the western sky,
and, though it seems to them as if the sun would never disappear, his broad disk does slowly sink behind the mountain;
and, while his last ray still lingers on the eastern summits,
merry voices break forth, and the ground resounds with bounding footsteps. The village belle arrays herself for her twilight
walk; the boys gather on "the green;" the lads and girls
throng to the " sningig school;" while some coy maiden lingers
at home, awaiting her expected suitor; and all enter upon the
pleasures of the evening with as keen a relish as if the day had
been a preparatory penance.,3.C,-eA'THE LADIES' READBR.

At such a time, one little roadside Inn, snugly sheltered beTiE LADIES' READER8

dahlias, looking over the palings of his neat well-ordered garden, had swilled as much as they cotuld carry; but the sweetbriar, roses, wall-flowers, the plants at the windows, and the
leaves on thle old tree were in the beaming state of moderate
company that had taken no more than was wholesome for them,
and had served to develop their beat qualities.  Sprinkling
dewy drops about them on the ground, they seemed profuse of

softening neglected corners which the steady rain could seldom

IF Christianity may be said to have given a permanent elevation to womiian, as an intellectual an(d,loral being, it is as true,
that the present age, above all others, has given play to her
genius, and taught us to reverence its influence.  It was the
fashion of other timnes to treat the literary acquirements of the
sex, as starchled pedantrv, or vain pretension; to stigmatize
themrn as inconsistent with those dlonestic affections and virtues,
which constitute the charmii of society.  We lhad abundant
hoinilies read upon their amli:a,le weaknes.ses and sentimnental
delicacy, upon tiheir tillmi( ge,ltleness and submnissive dependence; as if to taste the firluit of knowledge vwere a deadly sin,
and ignlorance vwere the solet guardian of innocence.  Their
whole lives were "sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;"
and concealmnent of intellectual power was often resorted to, to
escape the dangerous imnputation of nmasculine strengtlh.
In the higher walks of life, tlhe satirist was not without color

beyond that of purity and devotion to their families. Admnirable as are these qualities, it seemed an abuse of the gifts of
Providence, to deny to mothers the power of instructing their
children, to wives the privilege of sharing the intellectual pursuits of their husbands, to sisters and daughters the delight of
milistering knowledge in the fireside circle, to youlth and beauty
the charm of refined sense, to age and infirmnity the consolation
of studies which elevate the soul, and gladden the listless hours
of despondency.

At a second glance, and on a more mintte examination of
his face, you might have known that it was no other than Benjamin Britain himself that stood in the doorway--reasonably
changed by time. but for the better; a very comfortable host
indeed.
"Mrs. B.," said Mr. Britain, looking down the road, " is rather
late. It's tea time."
As there was no Mrs. Britain coming, he strolled leisurely
out into the road and looked up at the house, very munch to his
satisfaction. "It's just the sort of house," said Benjamin, "I
sholIld wish to stop at, if I didn't keep it."
Then he strolled toward the garden paling, and took a look at
the dahlias. They looked over at him with a helpless, drowsy
hanging of their hIeads: which bobbed again, as the heavy drops
of wet dripped off themn.
"You must be looked after," said T3enjanin. "Memorandum, not to forget to tell her so. She's a long time coming!"
Mr. Britain's better half seemed to be by so very much his
better half, that his own moicty of himself was utterly cast away
and helpless withlout her.
"She hadn't mnluch to do, I think," said Ben. "There were
a few little matters of business after market, but not many. Oh!
here we are at last!"
A chaise-cart, driven by a boy, came clattering along the
road: and seated in it, in a chair, with a lhrge well-saturated
umb ella spread out to dry behind her, was the plumip figure of
a matron ly woman, with her bare armls folded across a basket
which she carried on her knee, several other baskets and parcels
lvintg crowded about her, and a certain bright good-lnature in
her face and contented awkwardness in her matnner, as she jogged to and fro with the motion of her carriage, which smnacked
of old times, even in the distance. Upon her nearer approach,
this relish of bygone days was not diminished; and when the
cart stopped at the Nutmleg Grater door, a pair of shoes, alighting from it, slipped nimbly throngh Mfr. Britain's open arms, and
came down withl a substantial weighlt upon the pathway, which
shoes could hardly have belonged to any one but Clemency
Newcome.
In fact they did1 belong to her, and she stood in them, and a
rosy comfortable-looking soul she was; with as much soap on
her glossy face as in times of yore, but with whole elbows now,
that- ad grown quite dimpled in her imlproved condition.
"You're late, Clemmy! said Mr. Britain.THE LADIES' READER.

"Bless their precious faces I" said Mrs. Britain, unbonneting
her own rouind coutitenance (for she antd her husband were by
this timne in the' bar), and smoothing her hair with her open
hands. "G;i\e us a kiss, old man:'
iMr. Britaini promnptly complied.
",I think," said Mrs. Britain, applying herself to her pockets,
and drawing forth an immense bulk of thin books and crumpled
papers, a very kennel of dogs' ears: "I've done everything.
Bills all settled-turnips sold-brewer's account loolked into
and paid-'bacco pipes ordered--seventeen pound four paid
into the Bank."
" Then there's the pony," said Clemency--" he fetched eight
pound two; and that an't bad, is it 1"
" It's very good," said Ben.
"I'm glad you're pleased I" exclaimed his wife. "I thought
you would be; and f think that's all, and so no more at present
from yours and cetrer, C. Britain."
Though the host of the Nutmeg Grater lhad a lively regard
for his good wife, it was of the old patronising kind; and she
amused him mlniglitily. Nothing would have astonished him so
much, as to have known for certain from any third party, that it
was she who managed the whole house, and made him, by her
plain straighltforward thrift, good-humor, honesty, and industry,
a thriving man. So easy it is, in any degree of life (as the
world very often finds it), to take those cheerful natures that
never assert their merit, at their own modest valuation; and to
conceive a flippant liking of people for their outward oddities
and eccentricities, whose innate worth, if we would look so far,
miglit make us blushl in the comparison!
It was comfortable to r,. Britain, to thlink of his own condescension in having married Clemency. She was a perpetulal
testimony to him of the goodness of his heart, and the kindness
of his disposition; and he felt that her being an excellent wife
was an illustration of the old precept, that virtue is its own
reward.

block and the axe.,There stood the executioner and his as\sistant.  All were clothed in mourning.    On the floor was scattered the sawdust which was to soak her blood, and in a dark,orner lay the bier which was to be her last prison.     It was

ni,. o'clock when the Queen appeared in the funeral hall.
Fletdtler, Dean of Peterborough, anld certain privileged persons,
to the number of more than two lhundred, were assembled.
The lball was hung with black cloth; the scaffold, which was
elevated about two feet and a half above the ground, was covered with black frieze of Lancaster; the armn-chlair in which
Mary was to sit, the footstool on which she was to kneel, thle
block otn which her head was to be laid, were covered with
black velvet.
The Queen was clothed in moturning like the hall and as the
ensigns of punishlment. Her black velvet robe, with its high
collar and hanging sleeves, was bordered with ermine. Her
mantle, lined with mDarten sable, was of satin, with pearl buttons, and a long train. A chain of sweet-smelling beads, to
wlhicll was attached a scapulary, and beneath that a golden
cross, fell upon her bosom. Two rosaries were suspended to
her girdlle, and a long veil of white lace, which in some measure softened this costume of a widow and of a condemned
criminal was thrown around her.
Arrived on the scaffold, Mary seated herself in the chair provi(led for her, with her face toward the spectators.  The Dean
of Peterborough, in ecclesiastical costume, sat on the right of
the Queen, with a black velvet footstool before him. The Earls
of Kent and Shrewsbury were seated like him on the right,
butt upon larger chairs. On the other side of the Queen stood
the Sheriff Andrews. with white wand. In front of Mary were
seen the executioner and his assistant, distinguishable by tlleir
vestments of black velvet, with red crape round the left arm.
Behind the Queen's chair, ranged by the wall, wept her attendants and maidens. In the body of the hall, the nol,les and
citizens from the neighboring counties were guarded by the
Inubketeers of Sir Amyas Paulet and Sir Drew D)rury. Beyond
the balustrade was the bar of the tribunal. The sentence was
read; the Queen protested against it in the name of royalty
and of innocence, but accepted death for the sake of the faith.
She then knelt before the block, and the executioner proceeded
to remove her veil. She repelled him by a gesture, and turning toward the Earls with a blush on her forehead, " I am not
accustomed," she said, "to be undressed before so numerous a
company, and by the hands of such grooms of the chamber."
She then called Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curie, who took
off her mantle, her veil, her chalins, cross and scapulary. On

their touching her robe, the Qtleen told them   to unloose the
corsage, and told down the ermine collar, so as to leave her
neck bare for the axe.   Her tmaidens weepingly yielded her
these last services.  Melvil and the three other attendants wept
and lamented, and Mary placed her finger on her lips to signitfy
that they should be silent.  She then arranged the handkerchief embroidered with thistles of gold, with which her eyes
had been covered by Jane Kennedy.       Thrice she kissed the
crucifix, each time repeating, "Lord, into thy hlands I commend my spirit."   She knelt anew, and leant her head on that
block whicih was already scored with deep marks; and in this
solemn attitude she again recited sotne verses froml the Psalms.
The executioner interrulpted her at the third verse by a blow
of the axe, but its trembling stroke only grazed her neck; she
groaned slightly, and the second blow separated the head from
the body.
EARTHI, WITH HER TIHOUSANID VOICES, PRAISES GOD.--LoXGFZLLOW.
Whlen frst, in ancient time, from Jubal's tongue,
The tuneful anthem filled the morning air,
To sacred hymnings and Elysian song
His music-breathing shell the minstrel woke.
Devotion breathed aloud from every chord;The voice of praise was heard in every tone,
And prayer, and thanks to Hiim, the Eternal One,To Himtn that, with bright inspiration, touched
The hilgh anld gifted lyre of heavenly song,
Aind warmned thle soul withl new vitality,
A stirring energy throughl nature breathed;
The voice of adoration from her broke-,
Swelling aloud in every breeze, and heard
Long iu the sullen w.aterfall,--vhat time
Soft Spring or hoary AutuIimn threw on earth
Its bloom or blighltng.-when the Stunmer smiled,
Or Winter o'er the year's sepulchlre mourned.
The Deity was there.--a nameless spirit
Moved in the hearts of men to do him homage;
And when the Morning smiled, or Evening, pale,
Hlung weeping o'er the melancholy urn,
They came beneath the broad o'erarching trees,
And in their tremulous shadow worshipped oft,
Where the pale vine hung round their simple altars,
And gray moss mantling hung. Above was heard
The melody of winds, breathed out as the greenu trees
Bowed to their qliveriug towuch in liri,:g Ir,lt,y.

The listless wave, that stole, with nmellow voice,
Wbere reeds grew rank upon tile rushy brinlk,
And to tile watldering wind the green sedge bent,
Sang a sweet song of fixed tranquillity.

A THANKS0GIVING DINNER.-M-Is.t Ass. STrPars
Oh, I love an old-fashioned thanksgiving,
When the crops are all safe in the barn;
Whetl the chickens are plump with good living,
And the wool is all spun into yarn.
It is pleasant to draw round the table,
When uncles and cousins are there,
And grandpa, who scircely is able,
Sits down in his old oaken chair.
It is pleasant to wait for the blessing,
With a heart free from malice and strife,
While a turkey that's portly with dressing,
Lies, meekly awaiting the knife.
Amid all the varieties of architecture-Grecian, Gothic, Swiss,
Chinese, and even Egyptian, to be met with on Long Island, there
may yet be found some genuine old farms, with bares instead
of carriage-houses, and cow-sheds in the place of pony stables.
To these old houses are still attached generous gardens, hedged
in with picket-fences, and teeming with vegetables, and front
yards full of old-fashioned shrubbery, with thick grass half a
centulry old mossing them  over.  These things, primitive, and
full of the olden times, are not yet crowded out of siglht byv

hearts, sometimes find them softened by the relics of the past,
to warmer and sweeter feelilgs thlan nlere filncy ever aroused.
One of these old hotuses, a low-roofed, unpretending dwelling,
exilibiting unmistakable evidence of what htad once been white
paint on the edges of its clap-boards, and crowned by a huge
stone chilnney, whose generous throat seemed half choked up
with swallows' nests, belonged to a character in our story which
the reader cannot have forgotten without breaking the authlor's heart.
It was autumn---bt a generous, balmy autumn, that seemed
to cajole and flatter thle sumlner into keeping it company close
up to Christmalls. True, the gorgeous tints of a late Indian
summiier lay richlly among the trees, but some patches of bright
green were still left, defying the season, atnd pttting aside, from
day to day, thle red and golden veil which the frost was constantly endeavoring to cast over them.
In front of the old house stood two maple--noble trees, such
as have had no time to root themselves arolund your modern
cottages. These maples, symmetrical as a pair of huge pine
cones, rose against the htllse a perfect cloud of gorgeous foliage.
One was red as blood, and with a dash of the most vivid green
still keeping its hold down the centre of each leaf-the other
golden all over, as if its roots were nourished in the metallic
soil of California, and its leaves dusted by the winds that drift
up gold in the valley of Sacramento.  These superb trees
blended and wove their ripe leaves together, now throwing out
a wave of red, now a mass of gold, and here a tinge of green
in splendid confusion.
All around, under these maples, the grass was littered with
a fantastic carpet of leaves, showered down from their branches.
They hung around the huge old lilac bushes. IThey fluttered
down to the rose thickets, and lay in patclhes of torn crimson
and crumpled gold among the bouse-leeks and mosses on the
roof.
In and out, through this shower of ripe leaves fluttered the
swallows. In and out along the heavy branches, darted a pair
of red squirrels, who owned a nest in one of the oldest and
most stately trees. In and out, through the long, low kitchen,
the parlor, the pantries, and the milk-room, went and came our
old friend, Mrs. Gray, the comely huckster-woman of Fulton
market. That house was hers. That great square garden at
thle back door was hers. How comfortable and harvest-like it
lay, sloping down toward the south, divided into section,TEE LADIES' READER.
crowded with parsnips, beets, onions, potatoes, raspberry thickets, and strawberry patches; in short, running over with a
stock in trade that had furnished her market stall durillg the
year.
The season was late.  The frost had been there nippi,,g,
biting and pinching up the noble growth of vegetables that wa.
to supply Mrs. Gray's stall in the winter months.  Half the
great white onions lay above ground, with their silvery coats
exposed. The beet beds were of a deep blackishl crimson; alid
the cucumber vines had yielded up their last delicate gherki,Js.
All her neighbors had gathered in their crops days ago, but
the good old lady only laughed and chuckled over the example
thus offered for her imitation. New England born and accustomed to the sharp east winds of lMaine, she cared nothing for
the petty frosts that only made the leaves of her beet and parsnip beds gorgeous, while their precious bulbs lay safely bedded
in the soil. No matter what others did, she nlever gathered
her garden crop till Thllanksgiving. That was her harvest time,
her great yearly jubilee-the season when lher accounts were
reckoned up-when her barns and dllars were running over
with the wealth of her little farm.
Christmas, New Year, the Fourth of July, in short, all the
holidays of the year were crowded inlto one with Mmrs Gray.
During the whole twelve months, she conlmemorated Thanksgiving only. The reader must not, for a moment, suppose that
the Thanksgiving Mrs. Gray loved to honor, was the mniserable
counterfeit of a holiday proclailned by the Governor of New
York. No! Mrs. Gray scorned this poor attempt at imitation. It made her double chin quiver only to think of it. If
ever a look of contempt crept into those benevolent eyes, it was
when people would try to convince her tlhat any Governor out of
New England, could enter into the spirit of a regular DownEast Thanksgiviung; or, tlhat any woman south of old Connecticlut, could be educated into the cullinary mysteries of a mince
pie. Her faith was boundless, her benevolence great, but in
these things Mrs. Gray could not force herself to believe.
You should have seen the old lady as Thanksgiving week
drew near--not the New York one, but that solemnly proclaimed by the Governor of Maine. Mrs. Gray heeded no other.
That week the woman of a neighboril, g sta!l took charge of
Mrs. Gray's bnsiless. The customers were serve hby a strange

these tbanks after the fashion of her ancestors.
You should have seen her then, surrounded by raisins, black
currants, pumpkin sauce, peeled apples, sugar boxes and plates
of golden butter, her plump hand pearly with flour dust, the
whole kitchen redolent with ginger, allspice and cloves I! You
should bave seen her grating orange peel and nutmegs, the
border of her snow-white cap rising and falling to the motion
of her hands, and the soft gray hair underneath, tucked hlurriedly back of the ear on one side, where it had threatened to
be in the way.
You shotlld have seen her in that large, splint-bottomed
rocking-cllair, with a wooden bowl in her capacious lap, and a
sharp chopping-kilife in lher right hand; witlh what a soft, easy
motion the chioppi:g-knife fell! with whlat a quiet and smiling
air the dear old lady would take up a quantity of the powdered
beef on the flat of iler knife, and observe, as it showered softly
down to the tray again, that " meat chopped too fine for mince
pies was sure poison."
Yes, you should have seen AMrs. Gray at this very time, in
order to appreciate tully the perfections of an old-fashioned
New Engllnd housewife. They are departing from the land.
Railroads anld steanllboats are sweeping them away. In a little
tilne, providing our humble tale is not first sent to oblivion,

the work hands are getting to be legendary even now.
The day came at last, bland as the smile of a wann heart, a
breath of summer seemed whispering with the over-ripe leaves.
The sunshine was of that warm, golden yellow which belongs
to the autumn. A few bardy flowers glowed in the front yard,
richllly tinted dahlias, marigolds, chrysanthemums, and China-asters, with the most velvety amnaranths, still kept their bloom,
for those huge old maples sheltered them like a tent, and flowers always blossomed later,in that house than elsewhere. No
wonder! Inside and out, all was pleasant and geniaL  The
fall flowers seemed to tlhrive upon Mrs. Gray's smiles  Her
rosy countenance, as she overlooked them, seemed to warm up

imperious looking turkey, that had stru tted away his brief life
in the barn-yard, was now snugly bestowed in the oven-Mrs.
Gray had not yet degenerated down to a cooking stove-his
heavy coat of feathers was scattered to'the wind. His head,
that arrogant crimson head, that hlad so often awed the whole
poultry yard, lay all unheeded in the dust, close by the horseblock. There he sat, the poor denuded monarch-turned up in
a dripping pan, simmerinrg himself down in the kitchen oven.
Never, in all his pomnp, hlad that bosom been so warmed and
distended-yet the huge turkey had been a sad gourmand in
his time. A rich thymy odor broke through every pore of his
body; drops of luscious gravy dripped down his sides, filling the
oven with an unctuous stream that penetrated a crevice in the
door, and made the poor Irish girl cross herself devoutly. She
felt her spirit so yearning after the good things of earth, and
never having seen Thanksgiving set down in the calendar, was
shy of surrendering ber heart to a holiday that had no saint to
patronize it.
No wonder! the odor that stole so inlsidiously to her nostrils
was appetising, for the turkey had plenty of companionship in
the oven. A noble chicken-pie flanked his dripping pan on the
right; a delicate sucking pig was drawn up to the left wing;
in the repsr towered a mountain of roast beef, while the mouth
of the oven was choked up with a generous Indian pudding.
It was an ovenful worthy of New England, worthy of the day.
The hours came creeping on when guests might be expected.
Mrs. Gray was ready for company, and tried her best to remain with proper dignity in the great rocking chair that she
had drawn to a window commanding a long stretch of the
road; but every few moments she would start up, bustle across
thile room, and chlarge Kittvy, the Irish girl, to be careful and
watch the oven, to keep a sharp eye on the sauce-pans in the
fire-place, and, above all, to have the mince pies within range of
the fire, that they might receive a gradual and gentle warmth
by the time they were wanted. Tin she would return to the
room, arrange the branches of asparagus that hung laden with
red berries over the looking-glass, or dust the spotless table
with her handkerchief, just to keep herself busy, as she said.
At last she heard the distant sound of a wagon, turning down
the cross road toward the house. She knew the tramp of her
own market horse even at that distance, and seated herself by
the window ready to receive her expected guests with becoming
dignity.

The little one-horse wagon came down the road with a sort
of dash quite honorable to the occasion.  Mrs Gray's hired
man was beginning to enter into the spirit of a holiday; and
the old horse himself made every thing rattle again, he was so
eager to reach home the moment it hove in sight.
The wagon drew up to the door yard gate with a flourish
worthS of the Third avenue. The hired tnan sprang out, and
with some show of awkward gallantry, lifted a young girl in a
pretty pink calico dress and a cottare bonnet, down from the
front seat  Mrs. Gray could maintain her position no longer;
for the young girl glanced that way witlh a look so eloquent, a
smile so bright, that it warmed the dear old lady's heart like a
flash of fire in tlhe winter time. She started up, hastily shook
loose the folds of her dress, and went out, rustling all the way
like a tree in autumn.
"You are welcome, dear, welcome as green peas in June, or
radishes in March," she cried, scizing the little hand held
toward her, and kissing the heavenly young face.
The girl turned with a bright look, and making a graceful
little wave of the hatnd toward an aged mian who was tenderly
helping a female from the wagon, seemed about to speak.
"I understand, dear, I know all about it! the good old people-grrandpa and grandma, of course. Ilow could I help
knowing them?"  Mrs. Gray went up to the old people as she
spoke, with a bland welcome in every feature of her lace.
"Know them, of course I do!" she said, enfolding the old
gentleman's hand with her plump fingers. "I-I-gracious
goodness, now, it really does seem as if I had seen that face
somewhere!" she added hesitating, and with her eyes fixed
doubtingly on the stranger, as if she were calling up some vaue
remembrance, "strange, now isn't it? but he looks natural as
life."
The old man turned a warming glance toward his wife, and
then answered, with a grave smile "that, at any rate, Mrs. Gray
could never be a stranger to them, she who had done so much-"
-he interrupted hiim with one of her mellow laughs. Thanks
for a kind act always nmade the good woman feel awkward, and
she blushed like a girl.
All trtuly benevolent persons shrink from spoken thanks. The
gratitude expressed by looks and actions may give pleasure, but
there is something too material in words-they destroy all the
refinement of a generous action. Good Mrs. Gray felt this the
more sensitively, becalse her own words had seemed to chal407THE LADIES? READER.
lenge the thanks of her guest. The color came into her smooth
cheek, and she began to arrange the folds of her dress with both
hands, exhibiting a degree of awkwardness quite unusual to:
her. When she lifted her eyes again, they fell upon a young
man coming down the cross road on foot, with an cager and
buoyant step.
"There he comes; I thought he would not be long on the
way," she cried, while a flash of gladness radiated her face.
"It's my nephew; you see him there, Mrs. Warren-no the
maple branch is in the way! Ilere he is again-now look! a
noble fellow, isn't he t"
Mrs. Warren looked, and was indeed struck by the free air
and superior appearance of the yoluth. lie hlad evidently

and hlis f:.  was flushed with exercise. Seeing his aunt, the

The last exclamati6on was drawn forth by Julia Warren, who
had seated herself at tihe foot of the largest maple, and with
her lap full of flowes, was arranging them into bouquets. On
hearing Robert's voice she looked up with a glance of pleasant
surprise, and a smile broke over her lips. There was something
so rosy and jioyous in his face, and in the tones of his voice,
that it ripiled throtngh her heart aM if a bird overhead had just
broken into song. The youth looked upon her for a moment with
his bright, gleefll eyes, then, throwing off his hat and sweeping
back the damp chestnut curls froin his forehead, he sat down by
her side, and cast a glance of laulghing defiance at his relative.
"Come out here and get the kisses, Aunt Sarah, I have
made up my mind to stay among the flowers!"
Mrs. G(rav laughed at the youlng rogue's impudence, as she
called it, and carme out to meet him.

At thalt moment the Irish girl came through the front door
with an expression of solemn import in her face. She whispered in a flustered manner to her mistress, and the words
"spoilt entirely" reached Robert's ear.
Awav went the aunt, all in a state of excitement, to the kitcllein.
Wha;tever mnischief had happened in the kitchen, the dinner
turned oult magnificently.  The turkey came upon the table a
perfect mniracle of cookery. The pig absolutely looked more
beauitiful than life, crouc}hing in his bed of parsely, with his
head up, and holding a lemon daintily between his Jaws. lTh'l
chickl;en pie, pinched aroiund the edge into a perfect embroidery
by the two plump thumbs of Mrs. Gray, and then finished off
by an elaborate border done in key work, would have charmed
the most fitstidiouls artist.
You lhave no idea, reader mine, how beautiful colors may be
blended on a dinner table, ulnless you have seen just the kind of
feast to which Mlrs. Gray invited her guests. The rich brown
of the meats; the snow-whlite bread; the fresh, golden butter;
the cranibertry saucc, with iths bright, ruby tinge, were daintily
minglcd with plates of pies, arranged( after a minost tempting
fashion.  Goldlen custard; the deep red tart; the brown mince
and tawny orange color of the pumpkin, were placed in alternate
wedges and radiating from the centre of each plate like a star,
stood at eqtal distances round the table.  Water sparkling from
the well; currant wine brilliantly red-contrasted with the
sheeted snow of t)he table-cloth; and the gleam of crystal; then
that old arm-chair at the head of the table, with its soft crimson
cushions. I tell you again, reader, it was a Thanksgiving dinner
worthy to be remembered.   That poor family from the miserable basement in New York, did remember it for many a weary
day after. Mrs. Gray remembered it, for she had given delicious
pleasure to those old people. She had, for that one day at least,
lifted them from their toil and depression.

Rampart and flag, and tent, like the spectres of a dream.
All up the mountain side, all down the woody vale,
All by the rolling tide, waved the Persian banners pale.
And king Leonidas, among the slumbering band,
Sprang foremost from the pass, like the lightuiteg's living brand;
Then double darkness fell, and the forest ceased to moan,
But there came a clash of steel, and a distant dying groan.
Anon, a trumpet blew, and a fiery sheet burst high,
That o'er the midnight threw, a blood-red canopy.
A host glared on the hill: a host glared by the bay;
But the Greeks rush'd onward still, like leopards in their play.
The air was all a yell, and the earth was all a flame,
Whiere tile Spartan's bloody steel on the silken turbans came;
And still the Greek rushed on, beneath the flery fold,
Till, like a rising sun, shone Xerxes' tent of gold.

And tlhe warrior's deathless fame, was sung in strains divine.

But down swept all his power, with chariot and with charge;
Down pour'd the arrowy shower, till sank the Dorian's targe.
They march'd within the tent, with all their strength unstrung:
To Greec one look they sent, then on hligh their torches flung;
To heaven the blaze uproll'd, like a mighty altar-fire;
And the Persians' gems and gold were the Grecians' funeral pyre.
Their king sat on the throne, his captains by his side,
While the flame rush'd roaring on, and their plean loud replied I!

THE PILGRIM{'S VISION-OLMxu WSNDILL HoLMY
I saw in the naked forest
Our scattered remnant castA screen of shivering bralncles
Between them and the blast;
The snow was falling round them,
The dying fell as last:
I looked to see them perish,
When lo I the vision passed.
Again mine eyes were openedThe feeble had waxed strong;
The babes had grown to sturdy men,
The remnant was a throng.
By shadowed lake and winding stream,  
Alnd all the shores alotg,
The howling demons quaked to hear
The Christian's godly song.
They slept-the village fathersBy river, lake, and shore,
When far adown the steep of Time
The vision rose once more:
I saw along the winter snow
A spectral colulnl pour;
And high above their broken ranks
A tattered flag they bore.
Their Leader rode before them,
Of bearing calm and high,
The light of leaven's own kindling
Throned in his awful eye:
These were a Nation's champions
Her dread appeal to try;
"God for the right I" I faltered,
And lol thle train passed by.
Once more; the strife was ended,
The solemn i.ssue tried;
The Lord of Hosts, his mighty arm
Had helped our Israel's side:
Gray stone and grassy hillock,
Told where her martyrs died;
And peace was iu the borders
Of victory's chosen bride.
A crash..as when some swollen cloud
Cracks o'er the tangled trees I
With side to sido, and spar to spar,
Whose smoking decks are theose?

THE HUITER-A LEGEND.-J. G. WnlTTtrz
The hunter went forth with his dog and gun,
In the earliest glow of the goldell sun;
The trees of the forest bent over his way,
In the changeful colors of autumn gay;
For a frost lad fallen, the night before,
On the quiet greenness whichl nature wore:--
A bitter frostl-for the night was chill.
And starry and dark, antd the wind was still;
And so. when the sun looked out on tlhe hills,
On the stricken weoods and the frosted rills,
The ulnvaried green of tihe landscatpe fle(l,
And a wild, rich robe was given instead.
We know not whither the hutter went,
Or how the last of his days was spent;
For the noon drew nighl-but he camo not back,
Weary and faint, from his forest track;
And the wife sat down to her frugal board,
Beside the empty seat of her lord.
And the day passed on, and the sun caume down
To the hills of the west like an angel's crown;
The shadows lengtlhened from w(od and hill,
The mist crept up from the meadow-rill,
Till the broad sunt sank, and the red light rolle(l
All over the west like a wave of gold.
Yet he came not back-though the stars gave fortl
Their wizard light to the silent earth;
And his wife looked out from the lattice dim
In the earnest manner of fear for him;
Anld his fair-haired clhild on the door-stone stood
To welcome his fatller back from the wood I
He came not back-yet they found him soon
In the burning light of the morrow's noon,
In the tixed and visionless sleep of death,
Where the red!eaves fall at the soft wind's breath;
And the dog, whose step in the chase was fleet,
Crouched silent and sad at the hunter's feet,
He slept in death;-but his sleep was one
Which lis neigllbrs shuddered to look upon:
For hlis brow was black. and his open eye
Was red with the sigr of agolny;And they thought, as they g7xved on lhis features grim
That an evil deed had bef n done ou him.

They buried him wllere his fathers laid,
By the mossy mounds in tle grave-yard shade;
Yet whispers of doubt pazsed over the dead,
And beldames muttered while prayers were said;
Anld tite hand of the sexton sh,ook as he pressed
Thel damp earth down on the hunter's breast
The seasons passed; and the autumn rain
And thle colored forest returned againi:'Twas the very eve that the htlunter died:
The winds wuiled over the bare hill-side,
And the wreatlling limbs of the fiorest shook
Their red leaves over the swollen brook.
There came a sound on the night-air then,
Like a spirit-shriek to the homes of men,
And louder and shriller it rose again,
Like the fearful cry of the mad with pain;
Anld trembled alike the timid and brave,
For they knew thlat it came from the hunter's grave;
Atnd, every year, when autumn flings
Its beautiful robe on created things,
Whlen Piscataqua's tide is turbid with rain,
And Cclheco's wo,ds are yellow again,
That cry is heard from the grave-yard earth,
Like the howl of a demon struggling forth.
LOVE OP THE BEAUTIFULC-Joax Rcazn.
It has been said by Schiller, in his letters on aesthetic,,,.,
that -'the sense of beauty never farthered the performance of a
single duty."
Although this gross and inconceivable falsity will hardly be
accepted by anv one in so many terms, seeing that there are
few so utterly lost but that they receive, and know that they
receive, at certain moments, strenrth of some kind, or rebuke
from the appealings of outward things; and that it is not possible for a Christian man to walk across so much as a rood of
the natural earth, with mind unagitated and rightly poised, without receiving strength and hope from     some stone, flower, leaf,
nor sound, nor without a sense of a dew falling upon him out of
the skv; though I say, this falsity is not wholly and in terms
admitted, yet it seems to be partly and practically so in much of
the doing and teachting even of holy men, who in the recom414THJE LADIES' READEL4
mending of the love of God to us, refer but seldom to those
things in which it is most abundantlv and imlmediately silown;
though they insist much on his giving of bread, and rainent,
and health, (which he gives to all inlferior creatures,) they require us not to thank himn for that glory of his works which
he has permitted us alone to perceive; they tell us often to
meditate in the closet, but they send us not, like Isaac, into
the fields at even, they dwell on the dulty of self-denial, but
they exhibit not the duty of delight. Now, there are reasons
for tllis, manifold, in the toil and warfare of an earnest mind,
which, in its efforts at the raising of tnen from utter loss and
misery, has often but little tinme or disposition to take heed of
anything more than the bare life, and of those so occupied it is
not for us to judge; but I think, that, of the weaknesses, distresses, vanities, schisms, and sins, which ofterl, even in the holiest men, diminish their usefuilness and mar their happiness,
there would be fewer, if, in their struggle with nature fallenl, they
sought for more aid froml nature un(lestroyel. It seeims to nme
that the real sources of bluntness in the feelinlgs toward the
splendor of the grass and glory of the flower, are less to be
found in ardlor of occupation, in seriousness of compassion, or
heavenliness of desire, than in the turning of the eye at intervals of rest too selfshly within; the want of power to shake off
the anxieties of actual and near interest, and to leave results
in God's hands; the scorn of all that does not seem imnmediately apt for our purposes, or open to our understanding, and
perhaps something of pride, which desires rather to investigate
than to feel. At all events, whatever may be the inability in
this present life to mingle the filll enjovymnent of the Divine
works with the filll discharge of everv prantical duty, and confessedly in many cas-.s this mlist be, let us not attribute the
inconsistency to any indlignity of the f;cu,lty of contemplation,
but to the sin and the sulffering of the fallen state, and the change
of order from the keeping of the gardlen to tle tiililg of the
groulnd.  We cannot say how far it is r   oibit or agreeable with
God's will, while men are perishing round about us, while grief,
and pain, and wrath, and impiety, and death, and all the powers
of the air, are working wildly and evermore, and the cry of
blood going up to heaven, that any of us should take hand from
the plough; but this we know, that there will come a tinme
when the service of God shall be the beholding of him; and
though in these stormy seas, where we are now driven up and
down, his Spirit is dimly seen on the face of the waters, and we
41541i;
are left to cast anchors out of the stern, and wish for the day,
that day will come, when with the evangelists onl the crystal and
stable sea, all the creatures of God shall be fill of eyes within,
and there shall be "no more curse, btlt his servants shall serve
him, and shall see his face."
THE MJERRY MO1NT   OF JUtTN-J4'w RUBSSLL LOWzLL
Ob I what is so rare as a day in June?
Then, if ever, come perfect days;
Then Heaven tries the earth if it be in tune,
And over it softly her warm ear lays:
Whether we look, or whether we listen,
We hear life murmur, or see it glisten;
Every clod feels a stir of mighlt,
An instinct within it th:at reaches and towers,
And, grasping blindly above it for light.
Climbs to a soul in grass and flowers:
The fis h of life may well be seen
Thrilling back over hills and valle\s;
The cowslip startles in meadows green,
The buttercup catches the sun in its chalice,
And there's never a leaf or blade too inean
To be some happy creature's palace;
The little bird sits at his door in the sun,
Atilt like a blossom among the!eaves,
And lets his illumined being o'errun
With the deluge of summer it receives;
His mate feels the egg beneath her wings,
And the heart in her dumb breast flutters and sings;
He sings to the wide world, and she to her nestIn tile nice ear of Nature which song is the best?
Now is the high-tide of the year,
And whlatever of life hath ebbed away
Comes flooding back, with a ripply clleer,
Into every bare inlet and creek and bay:
Now thle heart is so full that a drop ovelfills it,
We are lappy now because God so wills it;
No matter hiow barren the past may lave been,'Tis enough for us now that the leav-es are green;
We sit in the warm shade and feel right well
How the sap creeps up and thle blosoms swell;
We may shut our eyes, but we cannot help knowing
That skies are clear and grass is growing;
The breeze comes whispering in our ear,
That dandelions are blossoming near,
That tnaile has sprouted. that streams are flowing,
That the river is bluer than tle sky,
That the robin is plastering his house hard by;

And if the breeze kept the gotd news back,
For other couriers we shouild not lack;
We could guess it all by you heifers lowingAnd hark I how clear bold chanticleer,
Warmed with the new wine of the year,
Tells all in his lusty crowing I
Joy comes, grief goes, we know not how:
Every thing is happy now,
Every thing is upward striving;'Tis as easy now for the heart to be true
As for grass to be green or skies to be blue-'Tis the natural way of living:
Who knows whither the clouds have fled?
In the unscarred heaven they leave no wake;
And the eyes forget the tears they have shed,
The heart forgets its sorrow and ache:
The soul partakes the season's youth,
And the sulphurous rifts of passion and woe
Lie deep'neath a silence pure and smooth,
Like burnt-out craters healed with snow.
THE CONSTANCY OF NATURE.-R-ICKArD II. DAsA.
How like eternity doth nature seem
To life of man-that short and fitful dream l
I look around me; nowhere can I trace
Lines of decay that mark our human race.
These are the murmuring waters, these the flowers
I mused o'er in my earlier, better hours.
Like sounds and scents of yesterday they come.
Long years have past since this was last my home!
And I am weak, and toil-worn is my frame;
But all this vale shuts in is still the same:
Tis I alone am changed; they know me not:
I feel a stranger-or as one forgot.
The breeze that cooled my warm and youthful brow
Breathes the same freshness on its wrinkles now.
The leaves that flung around me sun and shade,
While gazing idly ou them, as they played,
Are holding yet their frolic in the air;
The motion, joy, and beauty still ape there
But not for me I-I look upon the ground:
Myriads of happy faces throng me round,
Familiar to my eye; yet heart and mind
In vain would now the old communion find.
Ye were as living, conscious beings then,
With whom I talked-but I have talked' witb men I
With uncheered sorrow, with cold hearts I've met;

Seen hope cast down, turn deathly pale its glow,;
Seen virtue rare. but more of -i:t:,'s sl, w.

Few subjects are more nearly allied than these two--vulgarity and affectation. It may be said of them truly that "thin
partitions do their bounds divide." There cannot be a surer
proof of a low origin or of an innate meanness of disposition,
than to be always talking and thinking of being genteel. We
must have a strong tendency to that which we are always trying to avoid; whenever we pretend, on all occasions, a mighty
contemnpt for anything, it is a pretty clear sign that we feei ourselves very nearly on a level with it. Of the two classes of
people, I hardly know which is to be regarded with most distaste,
the vulgar aping the genteel, or the genteel constantly sneering
at, and endeavoring to distinguish themselves from the vulgar.
These two sets of persons are always thinking of one another;
the lower of the higher with envy, the more fortunate of their
less happy neighbors with contempt.   They are habitually
placed in opposition to each other; jostle in their pretensions
at every turn; and the same objects and train of thought (only
reserved by the relative situation of either party,) occupy their
whlole time and attention. The one are straining every nerve
and outing common sense, to be thought genteel; the others
have no other object or idea in their heads that not to be thoulght
vulgar. This is but poor spite; a very pitiful style of ambition.
To be merely not that which one lheartily despises, is a very
humble claim to superiority: to despise what otne really is, is
still worse.
Gentility is only a more select and artificial kind of vulgarity.
It cannot exist but by a sort of borrowed distinction. It plumes
itself up and revels in the homely pretensions of the mass of
mankind. It judges of the worth of every thing by name, fasbion, opinion; and hence, from the conscious absence of real
qualities, or sincere satisfaction in itself, it builds its supercilious and fantastic conceit on the wretchedness and wants of
others  Violent antipathies are always suspicious, and betray
a secret affinity. The difference between the "Great Vulgar
and the Small' is mostly in outward circumstances. The coxcomb criticises the dress of the clown, as the pedant cavils at
the bad grammar of the illiterate. Those who have the feweat resources in themselves, naturally seek the food of their

laugh at in strangers: scandal and satire prevail most in country piaces; andl a propensity to ridicule every the slightest
or tinost palpable deviation  from  what we happen to approve,
ceases with the progress of comlmon sense and decency.    True
worth does not exult in the fauilts alnd deficiency of othels; as
true refinement turns away from grossness and defortmity, instead
of being temnpted to ilndulge in an unmanly triumph over it.
FRaplhael woutld not faint away at the daubing of a sign-post, nor
Homer hold his head the higher for being in the company of a
Grub-street bari.   Real power, real excellence does not seek
for a foil in imperfectionr; nor fear contamination from coming
in contact witlh that wlich is coarse and hotmely.  It reposes on
itself, and is equally free from spleen and affectation.  But the
spirit of gentility is the mere essence of spleen and affectation;
-of affected delight in its own would-be qualifications, and of
ineffable disdain poured out upon the involuntary blunders or
accidental disadvantages of those whom it chooses to treat as
its inferiors.

Hearken, hearken I
The rapid river carrieth
Many noises underneath
The hoary ocean;
Teachilng his solemnity,
Sounds of inland life and glee,
Learnt beside the waving tree,
Wlhen the winds in summer prank
Toss the shades from bank to bank,
And the quick rains, in emotion
Which rather glads than grieves,
Count and visibly reliearse
The pulses of the universe
Upon the summer leavesLearnt among the lilies straight,
Whlen they bow them to the weight
Of many bees, whose hidden hIum

I saw his grief was eloquent, andl I let it have its flow; for
sorrow relieves itself by words.  When his paroxysmi had subsided, and he lhadl relapsetd into moody silence, I resumed the
subject gently, anld tirged him to break his situation at once to
his wife.  He shook his head mourtinfilly, but positively.

And the squirrel leaps adown,
Holding fast the tilbert brown;
And the lark, with more of mirth
In his song that suiteth earth,
Droppeth some in soaring high.
To pour the rest out in the sky:
While the woodland doves, apart
In the copse's leafy heart,
Solitary not ascetic,
Hidden and yet vocal, seem
Joining, in a lovely psalm.
Man's despondence, natlre's calm,
Half mystical anld half lpathetic,
Like a sighing in a dream.

Just in the tramping funeral's way;

To shun tlle face of the blushing bride,

The marriage hells do swing;
And in the shadow of the porch
Ant idliot sits, with his lean hands full
Of hedgkerow flowers and a puet's skull,

Iktcause it is s)o brown a tlhing,
While he sticketh the gaudy poppies red
In atnd out the senseless head,
Where all sweet fancies grew instead.
And you may hear, at the self-same time,
Another poet who reads his rhyme,

And an old man groans-with his testament
Only half signed-for the liib that's spent;
And lovers twain do ofy say,
As they sit on a grave, "for aye, for avel"
And foeman twain, while Earth, their mother,
Looks greenly upward, oure each other.
420THE LADIES' READER.
A school-boy drones his task, with looks
Cast over the page to the elm-tree rooks:
A lonely student cries aloud
Eurrekal clasping at his shroud;
A beldame's age-cracked voice doth sing
To a little infant slumbering:
A maid forgotten weeps alone,
Muffling her sobs on the trysting-stone;
A sick man wakes at his own mouth's wail;
A gossip coughs in her thrice-told tale;
A muttering gamester shakes the dice:
A redlper foretells good-luck from the skies;
A montarch vows as lihe lifts his hand to tlem;
A patriot leaving his native land to them,
Invokes the world against perjured state;
A priest disserts upon linen skirts;
A sinner screams for one hope more;
A dancer's feet do palpitate
A piper's music out on the floor;
And nigh to the awful Dead, the livinq
Low speech and stealthy steps are giving,
Because he cannot hear;
And he. wto on that narrow bier
Has room enow, is closely wound
In a silence piercing more than sound.

Hearken, hearken!
God speaketh to thy soul;
Using the sihpreme voice which doth confound
All life with consciousness of Dleity,
All senses into one;
As the seer-saint of Patmos, loving John,
For whom did backward roll
The cloud-gate of the future, turned to see
The Voice which spake. It speaketh now--
Through the regular breath of the calm creation,
Through the moan of the creature's desolation,
Striking, and in its stroke resembling
The memory of a solemn vow,
Which pierceth the din of a festival
To one in the midst-and he letteth fall
The cup, with a sudden trembling.

God speaketh in thy soul;
Saying,' 0 thou, that movest

THE COUNTRY CLEROYMAN.--OoLasYxT.
Near yonder copse, whlere on  the garden smil'd,
And still where many a iarden flower grows wild,
There. where a few torn shrulbs the place disclose,
The village preacher's nodest mansion rose.
A man he was to all the country dear,
And passing rich with forty pounds a year;
Remote from towns he ran his godly race,
Nor e'er had chang'd, nor wished to change his place;
Unskilful he to fiwn, or seek for power,
By doctrines fashiion'd to the varying hour;
Far other aims his heart had learn'd to prize,
More bent to raise the wretched than to rise.
His house was known to all the vagrant train,
He chid their wanderings, but reliev'd their paiu;
The long-remember'd beggar was his guest,
Whboe beard decending swept his aged breast;
The ruin'd spendthrif, now no longer proud,
~"laim'd kinldred there, and hat his claims allow'd
The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,
Sate by his fire. and talk'd the tlight away;
Wept o'er his wouncds, or, ttles of sorrow done,
Shoulder'd his crutch, and show'd how fields were won.
Pleas'd with his guests, tle good man learu'd to glow,
And quite forgot their vices in their woe:
Careless their merits or their faults to scan,
His pity gave ere chlarity began.
Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,
And e'en hi.s failing lean'd to virtue's side;
422THE LADIES' READER.
But in his duty prompt at every call,
He watch'd and wept, he pray'd and felt for all;
And, as a bird each fond endearment tries
To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,
He tried each art, reprov'd each dull delay,
Allur'd to brighter worlds and led the way.
Beside the bed where parting life was laid,
And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismay'd,
The reverend clampion stood. At his control,
Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;
Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,
Anud his last faltering accents whisper'd praise.
At church, with meek and unaffected graoe,
His looks adorn'd tile venerable place;
Truth from his lips prevail'd with douible sway,
And fools who came to scoff, remain'd to pray.
The service past, around the pious man,
With ready zeal each honest rustic ran;
E'en children follow'd, with endearing wile,
And pluck'd his gown to share the good man's smu.
His ready smile a parent's warmth exprest,
Their welfare pleas'd him, and their cares distrest;
To them hLs lheart, his love, his griefs, were e&amp;ven,
But all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven
As some tall cliff that lilts its awful form,
Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,
Eternal sunshine settles on its bead.

transcript of infinite power and perfection. Every other volumne is limited in its usefulness and influence; but the Bible

mankind. Its tidings, whether of peace or of woe, are the
same to the poor, the ignorant, and the weak, as to the rich,
the wise, and the powerful.
Among the most remarkable of its attributes, is justice; for
it looks with impartial eves on kings and on slaves, on the hero
and the soldier, on philosophers anlld peasants, on the eloquent
and the dumb. From all it exacts the same obedience to its
commandments, and promises to the good, the fruits of his labors; to the evil, the reward of his hands. Nor are the purity
and holiness, the wisdom, benevolence  and truth of the Scriptures, less conspicuous than their justice. In sublitnity and
beauty, in the descriptive and pathetic, in dignity and simlplicity
of narrative, in power and comprehensiveness, depth and vanlety of thought, in purity and elevation of sentiment, the most
enthusiastic admirers of the hceathen classics have conceded
their inferiority to the Scriptures.
The Bible, indeed, is the only universal classic, the classic
of all mankind, of every age and counltry, of time and eternity,
more humble and simple than the primer of a child, more grand
and maggnificent than the epic and the oration, the ode and the
drama, when genius with his chariot of fire, and his horses of
fire, ascends in whirlwind into the lheaven of his own invention.
It is the best classic the world has ever seen, the noblest that
has ever honored and dignified the language of mortals!
If you boast that the Aristotles, and the Platos, and the Tullies, of the classic age, "dipped their pens in intellect," the sacred authors dipped theirs in inspiration. If those were the
"secretaries of nature," these were the secretaries of the very
Author of nature. If Greece and Ronme have gathered into
their cabinet of curiosities the pearls of heathen poetry and eloquence, the diamonds of Pagan hi.story and Philosophy, God
himself has treasured up, in the Scriptures, the poetry and eloquence, the philosophy andi history of sacred lawgivers, of
prophets and apostles, of saints, evangelists, and martyrs. In
vain mav you seek for the pulre and simple light of nniverbdl
truth in the Augustan ages of antiquity. In the Bible onl) Is
the poet's wish fulfilled"And like the sun be allrone boulndless eye."

49PREFACE.
A " LADIES' READER" adapte(d to tihe ta stes of alvan(ced annd intelligent pupils is a want so generally acknowledged by Teachllers,
that thle attempt to supply thlis need Ilrs been pressel upon me
rather as a nece&amp;sity, tllan from any desire to inclease the number
of Elocutionary Text BIooks.
5With the voting, Eloclution Imust be rendere(d an attractive study,
or it is at best INEFFECTIVE in its results. Examples for practice
nmust be varied and interesting in their character, or they will not
comlmland the attention and sympatliies of Pupils: and the selections must afflord illiustrations of all the valrieties anrid modifications
of Elocutionary expression, or the work will be comparatively valueless, in the hands of the best Instructors of the Art. An excellence tlat shall be unmistakable in the literary and poetic character of the selections must be combined with an interest equally
sustained in the Pieces themselves.
Attractiveness and instructiveness are the two essentials which I
have endeavored to unite in the present work. A wide field of
literature has been embraced in my clhoice of subjects. The most
approved specimens of standard authors have been useld, a large
portion of which have never before been introducedl into "Schlool
Readers"-and these have been chosen and arranged withl a (flle
regard to the developnment of a pulrely natural and impressire
method of delivery. I have also providedl a rich an(l varie(d collection of Poeti examples for practice in Ilodulation, and emotional
eCrpresion. At the same time I have not neglected a phase of
the Art which may be characterized as the " Colloquial style,"TIlE LAlES      R.\I)I',.

Meanwhile, whence comes it that among

SO joyous w\ith such laughing air,

And yet the bride is fair and young I
Is it Sintt Joseph would sav to us all,
That love, o'er-hastv, precedeth a fall?
0, no! for a maiden frail, I trow,
Never bore so lofty a brow!
What lovers I they give not a single caress!
To see them so carel,ss and cold to-day,
These are grand people, one would say.
What ails Baptiste? whbat grief doth himu oppress?
It is, that, half way up the hill,
In yon cottage, by whose walls
Stand the cart-house and the stalls,
Dwelleth the blind orplian still,
Daughter of a veteran old;
And you must know, one year ago,
That Margaret, the young and teuder,
Was the village pride and splendor,
And Baptiste her lover bold.
Love, the deceiver, them ensnared:
For them the altar was pretlpredt
But alas I the summer's bliglht.
The dread disease that none canl stay,TIlE LADIES READEIR.
The pestilence that walks by night,
Took the young bride's sight away.
All at the father's stern command was changed;
Their peace was gone, but not their love estranged.
Wenried at home, ere long the lover fled;
Returned but tliree short days ago,
The golden cllhain they roulnd him thlrow,

To marry Angela, and yet
Is tlinking ever of Margaret.
Tlhen suddenly a maiden cried,
"Anna, There,sa, Mary, Kate I
Here coimes the cripple Jane I " And by a fountain's side
A woman, bent and gray with years,
Under the mulberry-trees appears,
And all towards ber run, as fleet
As had they wings upon their feet.
It is that Jane, the cripple Jane,
Is a soothsayer, wary and kind.
Sihe telleth fortunes, and none comllain;
She never deceives, she never errs.
But for this once the village seer
Wears a couitenance severe,
And from beneath her eyebrows thin and white
IIer two eyes flalsh like cannons brighlt
Aimed at the bridegroom in waistcoat blue,
Who, like a statue, stands in view;
Changing color, as well he might,
When the beldame wrinkled and gray
Takes the young bride by the hand.
And, witl the tip of her reedy wand,
Mfaking thle sign of the cross, doth say:"Thoughtless Angela, beware I
Lest, wlhen thou weddest this false bridegroom,
Thou diggest for thyself a tomb I "
And she was silent; and the maidens fair
Saw from each eye escape a swollen tear;
But on a little streamlet silver-clear,
What are two drops of turbid rain 7?
Saddened a moment, the bridal train
Resumed the dance and song again;
The bridegroom only was pale with fear;
And down green alleys
Of verdurous valleys,
With merry sallies,
They sang the refrain:"The roads should blossom, the roads should bloom,
So fair a bride shall leave her home I
Should blossom and bloom with garlands gay,
So fair a bride shall pass to-day I "Tile  LADIES' R1:EADUEl.

It is broad day, with sunshinle and with rain;
And yet the guests delay not long,
For soon arrives the bridal traiu,
And with it brings the village thlrong.
In sooth, deceit maketh no mortal gay,
For lo I Baptiste on thlis triumphlant day,
IMute as an idiot, sad as yester-morning,
Thinks only of the beldame's words of warning.
And Angela thinks of her cross, I wis;
To be a bride is all!' Tlhe pretty lisper
Feels her heart swell to hear all round her whisper,
*How beautiful I how beautiftl she is! "

To the church-yard forth they bear;
Village girls in robts of snow

Nowhere was a smile that day,
No, ah no I for each one seemed to say:"The roads should mourn and be veiled in gloom,
So fair a corpse shall leave its home I
Should mourn and should weep, ah, well-awayl I
So fair a corpse shall pass to-day!  
AMERICAN tIlSTORY.-JArREn SPARKs
ir many respects the history of North America differs from
that of every other country, and in this difference it possesses an
interest peculiar to itself, especiallv for those whose lot has been
cast here, and who look back with a generous pride to the deeds
of ancestors, by whom   a nation's existence has been created,
and a nation's glory adorned.    We shall speak of this history,
as divided into two periods, the colonial and the revolutionarY.
When we talk of the history of our countrr, we are not to be
understood as alluding to any particular book, or to the labors
of any man, or number of men, in treating this subject.    If we
have a few compilations of merit, embracing detached portions
and limited periods, there is vet wanting a work, the writer of
which shall undertake the task bf ploddinlg his way through all
the materials, printed and in muanuscript, and digesting them
into a united, continuous, lucid and philosophical whole, bearTllE LADIES' READER.
ing the shape, and containing the substance of genuine history.
No temnpting encouragemetnt, it is true, has been held out to
suchi an enterprise.'lTe absorbing present, in the midst of our
stirrinig politics and jarring party excitements, and bustling activity, has almost obliterated the past, or at least has left little
leisure for pursuing the footsteps of the pilgrims, and the devious f,ortunes of our ancestors. The public taste Ilas run in other
directions, and no man of geniuis and inrdustry has been found
so cour1ageous in his resolves, or prodigal of his labor, as to
waste l is life in digging iiito imirnes for treasures which would
cost hini much ancd avail hlim little. But symptolls of a change
are beginning to appear, whicll it may be hoped uill ere long
be realized.
And wlhen the time shall come for illustrating this subject, it
will he (liscovered that there are rich stores of knlowledge among
the hlidden andt forgotten records of our colonial Ihistory; that
the men of those days thought and acted, and sulffredl with a
wisdoin, a fortitude, and an cendlurance, whichl would add lustre
to any age; and that they have tranlsmitted an inlheritance as
honorab~le in the nmodce of its acquisition ms it is dear to its
present posses.sors. NNotwithlstanding thle comlparatively disconnected incidents in the history of tlhis period, and the separate
commiunities and govecriinments to whichl it extentds, it lhas inevertheless a unlity and a consistency of parts, as well as copiousness of events, whlich nmake it a iheline for the rmost gifted historian, and a study for every one whllo would enlarge hlis knowledge and profit by lIirh exaiiiple.
Unlike any other people, who have attained the rank of a
nation, we may here trace our country's growth to the very elemenllts of its origin, atid consult the testimonies of reality, instead of the blind oracles of fable, and the 1legends of a dubious
tradition.  Besides a love of adlventure and an enthusiasnm that,llrmounted every difficulty, thle character of its founders was
marked by a hardy enterprise and sturdiness of purpose, wlichl
carried them onward through perils and sufferings, that would
have appalled weaker minds and less resolute hearts. This is
the first great feature of resemblance in all the early settlers,
whether they came to the north or to the south, and it merits
notice from the influence it could not fail to exercise on their
future acts and character, both domestic and political. The
timid, the wavering, the feeble-minded, the sons of indolence
and ease, were not amnolLg those whlo left the comforts of home,

motives or any other.
Akinl to these chlaracteristics, alnd indeed a concomlitant with
thetmi, was a spirit of freedoolm, andl a restlessness undl,er conistrailt.

of religious intolerance.  But whatever Imotives ma1 have operated, thile prominent fact re mains the satne, and in tiis we imay
see throughllout the colonies a ulnliforml tba.is of that vigor of
character and indomitable love of liberty whichl appeared ever
afterward, in one guise or another, whenever occasions called
thelll )out.
Ilence it was, also, that the differeint olonlies,.althol ghl under

Wlhv their teans are falling so?
The old man may wee p for Ilis to-morrow,
Which is lost in lorng aro.
The old tree is leafle.ss in the forest,
The old year is ending in the frost;
The old wound, if stricken. is the sorest,
The old hope is hardest to be lost!
But the yotung young children, O my brothers,
Do you ask them wlhy they stand
Weeping sore before the bosoms of their mothers,
In our happy fathlerland?
They look ip witlh their pale and sunken faces,
And their looksk are sad to see;
For the man's grief untimely draws and presses
Down the cleeks of infancy.
"Your old earth," they say  i very dreary;  
"Our younlg feet," they say, "are vtry weak l
Few paces have we taken, yet are wvearyOur grave-rest is very far to seek  
Ask the old why - thley weep, and not the clildren,
For the ouitside earth is cold.

In this cottage (Gilbert's'{ol ngefst childt, a girl aboutt nine
years of age, ha(d been lvinlg ior a week in a fever.  It Awas Inow
Satttirday evening, and thie 1init11 day of the disease.  Was- she
to live or die? It seemnld as if a erx few lhours wetre bet:t  en
the iinnocet creaturle andl heaven.  A\ll the svmptotlis were
those of approaching death.  The parents knew;well thle chanFre
that comies over the human tice, llhether it be in infiancy, -youth

stood togrether by Margaret's btd, it seenmed to thelm that the

"Do vou tlink the chiiild is dying?" said Gilbert with a calm
voice to the surgeon, who, oil his wcalied hiore, had just arrivedl fromn anrotlier sick bed over the misty range of hills, and
hadl been loking steadfiastlv for soine Ininutes on the little patient.  Tle hulmane nlan klnew the family.well in the midst of
whom he was standllilig, an(t replied, "' While there is life there
is hope; but nmy pretty little Malrgaret is, I fear, in the last extremitv."  Thlere was,no loud lamiuentation at these words-all
had btfobre known, thiourh tlhey wouild not colfess it to ttlhenselves wllat they now were toldl-and though the certainty that
was in the words of the skillful man made their hearts beat for
a little with sicker throbbings, made their pale faces paler, and
brought out froln some eves a greater gush of tears; yet death
had been before in this houlse, and in this case he came, as he
always does, in awe, bult not in terror.
Tfeere were -wandering and wavering and dreamy phantoims in
the brain of the iinnocent child; but the few words lshe indistinctly
uttered were affectitlg, not renling to the heart, for it was plain
that she thougt herself herding her shiep in the green, silent
pastures, and sittingf wrapped in her plaid ulpon the sunny side
of the mllountain.  She was too much exhausted-there was too
little life, too little breath in her heart, to franme a tune; but
some of her words seemed to bhe from favorite old songs; and.t

liglht of a ffgrateful smilie on lhis cheek, as he saidl to the wortliv
surgeron, " You will partake of our fare tafter iyoulr day's travel
anld toil of hlulmanity."
In a short, silent ihalf lour tllhe potatotes anll oat-cake., bultter
and tmiilk were on tile board; and Gilbtrt, litting up his toilhardened but manly    hand, with a slow motioni at wlhich thei
rooin was as hushed as if it had been empty, closed his eves in
reverence, andll asked a blessini.'Iher,: is a little stool on
whlilch no one sat by the ol(d inin' side.  It had been put there
unwittingly, whelln the other seats were all plaeed in their usiual
order; but tihe goldlen lhead thllat was wont to rise at titat part
of the table was no)w wantin,.  Tlhere was silencel-not a word
was said-their timeal w\as before tlhemi-- God hlad beenl thallked,
andl they belran to eat.
While tllhey were at their silenlt meal, a horseman came galloping to the door, andl witlh a loud voiee called out, that he hal
been sent express with a letter to Gil!bert Ainslie, at the same
timle rudely, attd with an oath demanding a dram for his trouble.  The eldest son, a lad of eighteen, fiereelv seized the bridle
of his horse andtl turnedl his theatd iw vav fromu the door. The rider,
somewhat talarmed at tlhe fluslled tfce of the powertful stripling,
threw down the letter andi( rodle orf.
Gilbert took thle letter from  his son's hand, casting at the
samlo tilne a hlalf unpbraitlidin look on Ihis ftce, that was retturninir
to its formner color. " I f;aared," said the vouth, with a tear in
his eve, " I feared that the brute's voice and the trampling ofTlle LA.1)11i,.' 1'I.I DEIR.                         i
the horse's feet would have disturlldl her." (Gilbert held tile
letter hesitatijngly in hlis lill,d, as itf afraid, at that monlient to
read it; at leniirti he said aloud to tlhe sullrlen,'"You kn1ow
that I ami a poor mn11L, all11 debt)t, if juistly incurred, and lpulinctilally paidl when lliue, iS 10o dlislionor.'' Botih his lihand and his
voice shlook slighltly as ie spo,ke; but he opened( the letter firomt
the laySver, and iead it in silence.
At this iumomient his wife cam;le tfrol her chiild's bcd-side, and
looking anxiouils at her hiusband, told hin " lnot to mind about
the nleyllr, that no n;!an wh1o knelw hlii would atrrest his goods
or put hiill into prison. Tlltough, dear nce, it is cruel to be put
to it thus, when our child is dying, and when, if so it be the
Lord's will, she should have a decent burial, poor innocent, like
them that went before her."  Gilbert continued reading the letter, with a face.on which no emotion could be discovered; and
then folding it up, he gave it to his wife, told her she might
read it if she chose, and then put it into his desk in the room
beside the poor dear child. She took it from him without reading it, and crushed it into her bosom; for she turned her ear
toward her child, and thinl;ing she heard it stir, ran oult hastily
to its bedside.
Anotllher lhour of trial past, and the child was still swimming
for its life. The very dogs knlew therc was grief in the house,
and lay without stirring, ls if hiding themselves, below the long
tablet at the window. One sister sat with an unfinished gown
on her knees, that she had been sewing for the dear child, atnd
still continued at the lhopeless work, she scarcely knew why, and
often, often, putting up her hand to wipc away a tear. "'What
is that?" said the old man to his eldest daughter. "What is
that youl are laying on the shelf?"  Shle could scarcely reply
that it was a ribbon and an ivory comb that she had bought
for little Margaret, against the nighlt of the dancing-school ball.
And at these words, the father could not restrain a lotngr, dleepl
and bitter groan; at whlich the boy nearest in agre to hiis dyving
sister looked up, weeping, in his face, andl letting the tattered
book of old ballals which he had been poring over, but not reading, fall out of his hands, he ro.se from his seat, andll, going into
his father's bosom, kissed him, and asked God to bless him, for
the holy heart of the boy was moved within hi,n; and the old
man, as he embraced him, felt that in his innocenec and simplicity he was indeed a comfolter. "The Lord giveth anld the
Lord taketh away," saidl the oldl man; "blessed he the name of
the Lord."

foriler years bro(gllt petace andl resignttion hlitler, when their
hearts had been triedl, even as they niow were tried stood before
them. On the night before the Sabbath, the iniister of the
parish never left llis Matnse, except as now, to visit the sick or
dying bed.   Scarcely could Gilbert reply to his first question
about his child, when the surgeon canme fi'om the bed-roo1 m aind
said, "I Mangret seemt liftted Lp by GCod's hanld above death and
the grave: I tlhink she will recover.  She has tlllen asleep, and
whel sihe waktes, I hope--I believe-that the dal,lecr will be

Thely were all prepared for death; but now tlley were found

There was silence, glaadness an il sorrow and lAit little sleep in

ownlership. The ilnterior by L  no lneans corresponded witil the
exterior aspect, beintg even ollrec blare than nustn, and fir from

looked like a man in wollaun's clothes, and whlose blazing face,

I made my exit without waiting for tllhe conclusion of tl1ii
complinmentary observation; anrd the less relluctantly for hlav;lll
observed oii the table the lower part of one of rny silver teaspoons, the top of which  had been violently wreTnched off. Tli.

and I kniew that Mrs. Larkins llamd nonle to spare.
Unsuccessful thus far amontr the arlbitcrs of oulr destinl, I
tlhought I would stop at the house of a fiilend, and lmake some

saw Mrs. Stayner, I was silrprised t( find it silent anid uninhabited. The windows were closed; a half-finished cap lay on the
sofa, and a bunch of ye:sterday's wild-flowers upon the table.
All spoke of desolation. IThlle cradle-not exactty atn appropriate adljunct of a lib,rary seene elsewhere, but quite so at tilhe

I caught sight of the fair face of my friend. She was bending
over the bread-tray, and at the same time telling nursery-stories
as fast as possible, by way of coaxing her little boy of four years
old to rock the cradle which contained his baby sister.
"What does this mean i"
" Oh I nothing more than usual. My Polly took herself off
yesterday without a moment's warning, saying she thought she
had lived out about long enough; and poor Tom, our factotum,
has the agie. Mr. Stayner has gone to some place sixteen miles
off, where he was told he might hear of a girl, and I am sole
representative of the family energies. Bult you've no idea what
capital bread I can make.
This looked ratlier discouraging for my quest; but knowing
that the main point of table-companionship was the source of
most of Mrs. Stayvner's difficulties, I still hoped for Mrs. Larkins,
who loved the closest intinmacy with her "help," and always
took them visiting with her. So I passed on for another effort
at Mrs. Randall's, whose three datughters had sometimes been
known to lay aside their dignity long enough to obtain some
much-coveted article of dress. Here the mop was in full play;
and Mrs. Randall, with her gown turned up, was splashing diluted mud on the walls and furnittlre, in the received mode of
those regions, where "stained-glass windows" are made without
a patent. I did not venture in, but asked from the door with
my best diplomacy, whether Mrs. Randall knew of a girl.
"A gal! no; who wants a gal?"
"Mrs. Larkins."
"She I why don't she get up and do her own work?"
"She is too feeble."
"Law sakes! too feeble! she'd be able as anybody to thrash
round, if her old man didn't spile her by waitin' on----"
We think Mrs. Larkin deserves small blame on this score.
"But, Mrs. Randall, the poor woman is really ill and unable
to do anything for her children. Couldn't you spare Rachel for
a few days to help her I"
This was said in a most guarded and deprecatory tone, and
with a manner carefully moulded between indifference and undue solicitude.
" My gals has got enough to do. They a'n't able to do their
own work. Ctur'line hasn't been worth the fust red cent for
hard work e-ver since she went to school to A."

ladder which gave access to the upper regions--" fetch that

(lown a dole'tul-looking compounid of card-board and manycolored waters, which had, it seems, occupied her mind and
fingers for some davys.
"Tllere!" said the motliher, proudly, "a gal that's learnt to
make sich baskets as that, a'n't a goin' to be nobody's help, I
guess!"
I thought the boast likely to be verified as a prediction, and
went my way, cresttfallen and weary. Girl-hunting is certainly
among our imost formnidable " chores."
THE REGATTA AT VENICE.-JAmEs FEnIMORZ COOPRI
VYnICE, from her peculiar formation and the vast number of
her watermen, had long been celebrated for this species of
amusement. Famlilies were known and celebrated in her traditions for dexterous skill with the oar, as they were known in
Rome for feats of a far less usefill and of a more barbarous natlre. It was usual to select from these races of watermen the
most vigorous and skilful; and, after invoking the aid of patronsaints, and arousing their pride and recollections by songs that
recounteld the feats of their ancestors, to start them for the goal
with every incitement that pride and the love of victory could
awaken.
Most of these ancient usages were still observed. As soon as
the Bucentaur was in its station, some thirty or fofty gondoliers were brought forth, clad in their gayest habiliments and
surrounded and supported by crowds of anxious friends and
Jill
