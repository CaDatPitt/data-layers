listened to every shout and halloo reverberating among
the hills, intent to seize upon some tone of recognitio11 or
discovery. But the moon sank; and then the stars, whose
increased brightness had for a short time supplied her
place, all faded away; and then came the gray dawn of
the morning, and then the clear brightness of the day,——
and still Michael and Agnes were childless.

7. “She has sunk into some mossy or miry place,” said
Michael, to a man near him, into Whose face he could not
look, “a cruel, cruel death to one like her! The earth
on which my child Walked has closed over her, and we
shall never see her more!” A

8. At last, a man Who had left the search, and gone in
a direction toward the high-road, came running with some-
thing in his arms toward the place where Michael and
others. were standing beside Agnes, who lay, apparently
exhausted’ almost to dying, on the sward. He approached
hesitatingly ; and Michael saw that he carried Lucy’s bon-
net, clothes, and plaid. X

9. It was impossible not to see some spots of blood upon
the frill that the child had worn around her neck. “ Mur-
dered! murdered!” was the one Word, Whispered or ejacu-
lated all around; but Agnes heard it not; for, Worn out
by that long ‘night of hope and despair, she had fallen
asleep, and Was, perhaps, seeking her lost Lucy in her
dreams.

10. Isabel took the clothes, and, narrowly inspecting
them with eye and hand, said, with a fervent voice that
Was heard even in Michael’s despair, “No, Lucy is yet
among the living. There are no marks of violence on
the garments of the innocent; no murderer’s hand has
been here. These blood-spots have been put there to de-
ceive. Beside, Would not the murderer have carried off
these things? For What else would he have murdered her?
But, oh! foolish despair! VVhat speak I of ? For, Wicked
as the world is—ay! desperately Wicked ——-there is not, on

FIFTH READER. 99

all the surface of the wide earth, a hand that would mur-
der our child! Is it not plain as the sun in the heaven,
that Lucy has been stolen by some wretched gypsy beg-
gar?”

11. The crowd quietly dispersed, and horse and foot
began to scour the country. Some took the high-roads,
others all the by-paths, and many the trackless hills.
Now that" they were in some measure relieved from the
horrible belief that the child was dead, the worst other
calamity seemed nothing, for hope brought her, back to
their arms.

12. Agnes had been able to walk home to Bracken-Braes,
and Michael and Isabel sat by her bedside. All her
strength was gone, and she lay at the mercy of the rustle
of a leaf, or a shadow across the window. Thus hour after
hour passed, till it was again twilight. “I hear footsteps
coming up the brae,” said Agnes, who had for some time
appeared to. be slumbering; and in a few moments the
voice of Jacob Mayne was heard at the outer door.

13. Jacob wore a solemn expression of countenance, and
he seemed, from his looks, to bring no comfort. Michael
stood up between him and his wife, and looked into his
heart. Something there seemed‘ to be in his face that
was not miserable. “If he has heard nothing of my
child,” thought Michael, “this man must care little for
his own fireside.” “ Oh, speak, speak,” said Agnes; “yet
why need you speak? All this has been but a vain belief,

and Lucy is in heaven.”

14. “ Something like a trace of her has been discovered;
a woman, with  child, that did not look like a child of
hers, was last night at Clovenford, and left it at the dawn-
ing.” “Do you hear that, my beloved Agnes?” said
Isabel; “ she will have tramped away with Lucy up into
Ettrick or Yarrow; but hundreds of eyes will have been

- upon her; for these are quiet, but not solitary, glens; and

the hunt will be over long before she has crossed down

upon Hawick. I knew that country in my young days.
What say you, Mr. Mayne? There is the light of hope
in your face.” “There is no reason to doubt, ma’am, that
it was Lucy. Every body is sure of it. If it was my own
Rachel, 1 should have no fear as to seeing her this blessed
night.”

15. Jacob Mayne now took a chair, and sat down, with
even a smile upon his countenance. “ I may tell you now,
that Watty Oliver knows it was your child, for he saw her
limping along after the gypsy at Galla-Brigg ; but, having
no suspicion, he did not take a second look at her,——but
one look is sufficient, and he swears it was bonny Lucy
Forester.”

16. Aunt Isabel, by this time, had bread and cheese and
a bottle of her own elder-ﬂower wine on the table. “ You
have been a long and hard journey, wherever you have
been, Mr. Mayne; take some refresh1nent;” and Michael
asked a blessing. _

17. Jacob saw» that he might now venture to reveal the
whole truth. “ No, no, Mrs. Irving, I am over happy to
eat or to drink. You are all prepared for the blessing that
awaits you. Your child is not far off; and I myself, for it
is I myself that found her, will bring her by the hand, and
restore her to her parents.”

18. Agnes had raised herself up in her bed at these
words, but she sank gently back on her pillow; aunt
Isabel was rooted to her chair; and Michael, as he rose
up, felt as if the ground were sinking under his feet.
There was a dead silence all around the house for a short
space, and then the sound of many voices, which again
by degrees subsided. The eyes of all then looked, and
yet feared to look, toward the door.

19. Jacob Mayne was not so good as his word, for he
did not bring Lucy by the hand to restore her to her
parents; but, dressed again in her own bonnet and gown,
and her own plaid, in rushed their own child, by herself,

XXVIII. THE REAPER AND THE FLOWERS.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, (b. 1807, d. 1882,) the son of Hon.
Stephen Longfellow, an eminent lawyer, was born i11 Portland, Maine.
He graduated at Bowdoin College in 1825. After spending four years in
Europe, he was Professor of Modern Languages and Literature at BOW-
doin till 1835, when he was appointed to the chair of Modern Languages
and Belles-lettres in Harvard University. He resigned his professorship
in 1854, after which time he resided in Cambridge, Mass. Mr. Long-

‘ fellow wrote many original Works both in verse and prose, and made

several translations, the most famous of which is that of the works
of Dante. His poetry is always chaste and elegant, showing traces of
careful scholarship in every line. The numerous and varied editions of
his poems are evidences of their popularity.

1. THERE is a Reaper, Whose name is Death,
And, with his sickle keen,
He reaps the bearded grain at a breath,
And the ﬂowers that grow between.

DEFINITIONS.--3. Sheaves, bundles of grain. 4. To’ken (pro.

“Shall I have naught that is fair?” saith he;
“ Have naught but the bearded grain?

Though the breath of these ﬂowers is sweet to me,
I will give them all back again.”

He gazed at the ﬂowers with tearful eyes,
He kissed their droofiiiig leaves;
It was for the Lord of Paradise”...
p He bound them in his sheaves.

“My Lord has need of these ﬂowerets gay,”
The Reaper said, and smiled;

“Dear tokens of the earth are they,
Where he was once a child.

. “They shall all bloom in the ﬁelds of light,

Transplanted by my care,
And saints, upon their garments white,
These sacred blossoms wear.” I

And the mother gave, in tears and pain,
The ﬂowers she most did love;

She knew she should ﬁnd them all again
In the ﬁelds of light above.

. 0, not in cruelty, not in wrath,

The Reaper came that day;
’T was an angel visited the green earth,
And took the ﬂowers away.

XXIX. THE TOWN PUMP.

Nathaniel Hawthorne (b. 1804, d.18G4) was born in Salem, Mass. He
graduated at Bowdoin College in 1825. His earliest literary productions,
Written for periodicals, were published in two vo1umes—the first in 1837,
the second in 1842—under the title of “ Twice-Told Tales.” “Mosses from
an Old Manse,” another series of tales and sketches, was published in
1845. From 1846 to 1850 he was surveyor of the port of Salem. In 1852 he
was appointed United States consul for Liverpool. After holding this

oﬁice four years, he traveled for some time on the continent. His most .

popular works are “The Scarlet Letter,” a work showing a deep knowl-
edge of human nature, “The House of Seven Gables,” “The Blithedale
Romance,” and “ The Marble Faun,” an Italian romance, which is re-
garded by many as the best of his works. "Being of a modest and retiring
disposition, Mr. Hawthorne avoided publicity. Most of his works are
highly imaginative. As a prose writer he has no superior among Ameri-
can authors. He died at Plymouth, N. H., While on a visit to the White
Mountains for his health.

[SCENE.—T/Le corner of two principal streets. The Town
Pump talking through its nose]

1. NOON, by the north clock! Noon, by the east!
High noon, too, by those hot sunbeams which fall, scarcely
aslope, upon my head, and almost make the Water bubble
and smoke in the trough under my nose. Truly, We public
characters have a tough time of it! And among all the
town officers, chosen at the yearly meeting, Where is he
that sustains, for a single year, the burden of such mani-
fold duties as are imposed, in perpetuity, upon the Town
Pump?  T

2. The title of   town treasurer is rightfully mine, as
guardian of the best treasure the town has. The over-
seers of the poor ought to make me their chairman, since
I provide bountifully for the pauper, Without expense to
him that pays taxes. I am at the head of the ﬁre depart-
ment, and one of the physicians of the board of health.
As a keeper of the peace, all xwater-drinkers confess me
equal to the constable. I perform some of the duties of
the town-clerk, byipromulgating public notices, when they
are pasted on my front.

3. To speak within bounds, I am chief person of the
municipality, and exhibit, moreover, an adnqirable pattern
to my brother oﬁicers, by the cool, steady, upright, down-
right, and impartial discharge of my business, and the
constancy with which I stand to my post. Summer or
winter, nobody seeks me in vain; for, all day long I am
seen at the busiest corner, just above the market, stretch-
ing out my arms to rich and poor alike; and at night‘ I
hold a lantern over my head, to show where I am, and to
keep people out of the gutters.

4. At this sultry noontide, I am cup-bearer to the
parched populace, for whose beneﬁt an iron goblet is
chained to my waist. Like a dram-seller on the public
square, on a muster-day, I cry aloud to all and sundry,
in my plainest accents, and at the very tiptop I of my
voice. “Here it is, gentlemen! Here is the good liquor!
Walk up, walk up, gentlemen, walk up, walk up! Here
is the superior stuff! Here is the unadulterated ale of
father Adam! better‘ than Cognac, Hollands, Jamaica,
strong beer, or wine ovf any price; here it is, by the hogs-
head or the single glass, and not a cent to pay. Walk
up, gentlemen, walk up, and help yourselves!”

5. It were a pity if all this outcry should draw no cus-
tomers. Here they come. A hot day, gentlemen. Quaff
and away again, so as to keep yourselves in a nice, cool
sweat. You, my friend, will need another cupful to wash
the dust out of your throat, if it be as thick there as it is
on your cowhide shoes. I see that you have trudged half
a score of miles to-day, and, like a wise man, have passed
by the taverns, and stopped at the running brooks and
well-curbs. Otherwise, betwixt heat without and ﬁre
within, you would have been burnt to a cinder, or melted
down to nothing at al1—in the fashion of a jelly-ﬁsh.

6. Drink, and make room for that other fellow, who seeks
my aid to quench the ﬁery fever of last night’s potations,
which he drained from no cup of mine. Welcome, most

7. Mercy on you, man! The water absolutely hisses

down your red-hot gullet, and is converted quite into

steam in the miniature Tophet, which you mistake for a
stomach. Fill again, and tell me, on the word of an hon-
est toper, did you ever, in cellar, tavern, or any other kind
of dram-shop, spend the price of your children’s food for
a swig half so delicious? Now, for the first time these te11
years, you know the ﬂavor of cold water. ‘Good-by; and
whenever you are thirsty, recollect that I keep a constant
supply at the old stand.

8. Who next? Oh, my little friend, you are just let
loose from school, and come hither to scrub your bloom-
ing face, and drown the memory of certain taps of the
ferule, and other school-boy troubles, in a draught from
the Town Pump. Take it, pure as the current of your
young life; take it, and may your heart and tongue never
be scorched with a ﬁercer thirst than now.

9. There, my dear child, put down the cup, and yield

iiyour place to this elderly gentleman, who treads so ten-

derly over the paving-stones that I suspect he is afraid
of breaking them. VVhat! he limps by without so much
as thanking me, as if my hospitable offers were meant only
for people who have no wine-cellars. . I

10. VVell, well, sir, no harm done, I hope! Go, draw
the cork, tip the decanter; but when your great toe shall
set you a-roaring, it will be no affair of mine. If gentle-
men love the pleasant titillation of the g6ut, it is all one
to the Town Pump. This thirsty dog, with his red tongue
lolling out, does not scorn my hospitality, but stands on
his hind legs and ‘ laps eagerly out of the, trough. See
how lightly he capers away again! Jowler, did your
worship ever“ have the gout?

11. Your pardon, good people! I must interrupt my
stream of eloquence, and spout forth a stream of water,
to replenish the trough for this teafhster and his two yoke
of oxen, who have come all the way from Staunton, or

FIFTH READER. 107

somewhere along that way. No part of my business gives
me more pleasure than the watering of cattle. Look! how
rapidly they lower the water-mark on the sides of the
trough, till their capacious stomachs are moistened with
a gallon or two apiece, and they can afford time to breathe,
with sighs of calm enjoyment! Now they roll their quiet
eyes around the brim of their monstrous drinking vessel.
An ox is your true toper. i

12. I hold myself the grand reformer of the age. From
my spout, and such spouts as mine, must flow the stream
that shall cleanse our earth of a vast portion of its crime .
and anguish, which have gushed from the ﬁery fountainst.
of the still. In this mighty enterprise, the cow shall be
my great confederate. Milk and water!

13. Ahem! Dry work this speechifying, especially to
all unpracticed orators. I never conceived, till now, what
toil this temperance lecturers undergo for my sake. Do,
some kind Christian, pump a stroke or two, just to wet my
whistle. Thank you, sir. But to proceed.

14. The Town Pump and the Cow! Such is the glorious
partnership that shall ﬁnally monopolize the whole business
of quenching thirst. Blessed consummation! Then Pov-
erty shall pass away from the land, ﬁnding no hovel so
wretched where her squalid fohn m‘ay shelter itself Then
Disease, for lack of other victims, shall gnaw his own heart
and die. Then Sin, if she do not die, shall lose half her
strength. i

15. Then there will be no war of households. The hus-
band and the wife, drinking deep of peaceful joy, a calm
bliss of temperate affections, shall pass hand in hand through
life, and lie down, not reluctantly, at its protracted close.
To them the past will be no turmoil of mad dreams, nor
the future an eternity of such moments as follow the
delirium of a drunkard. Their dead faces shall express
What their spirits were, and are to be, by a lingering smile
of memory and hope. ‘

l INTRODUCTION.

I. PRELIMINARY REMARKS.

THE great object to be accomplished in reading as a
rhetorical exercise is to convey to the hearer, fully and
clearly, the ideas and feelings of the Writer.

In order to do this, it is necessary that a selection should be carefully
studied by the pupil before he attempts to read it. In accordance with
this view, a preliminary rule of importance is the following:

RULE I.—Before attempting to read a lesson, the learner
should make himself fully acquainted with the subject as
treated of in that lesson, and endeavor to make the thought,
and feeling, and sentiments of the Writer his own.

REMARK.—When he has thus identiﬁed himself with the author, he

has the substance of all rules in his own mind. It is by going to nature

that we ﬁnd rules. The child or the savage orator never mistakes in .

inﬂection, or emphasis, or modulation. The best speakers and readers

are those who follow the impulse of nature or most closely imitate it as -

observed in others. ‘

II. ARTICULATION.

Articulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds
of a language, and of their combinations. i   a

An Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound, made
by the organs of speech. ’

The Elementary Sounds of the English language are

divided into Vocals, Subvocals, and Aspiratcs.

pure and cold as when it slaked the thirst of the red
hunter, and ﬂowed beneath the aged bough, though now
this gem of the wilderness is treasured under these hot
stones, where no shadow falls, but from the brick build-
ings. But, still is this fountain the source of health,
peace, and happiness, and I behold, with certainty and
joy, the approach of the period when the Virtues of cold
Water, too little Valued since our father’s days, will be fully
appreciated and recognized by all.

XXX. Goon-NIGHT.

Samuel Griswold Goodrich (b. 1793, d. 1860) Was born in Ridgeﬁeld,
Conn. Mr. Goodrich is best known as “Peter Parley,” under which
assumed name he commenced the publication of a series of juvenile
Works about 1827. He edited “ Par1ey’s Magazine” from 1841 to 1854. He
Was appointed United States consul for Paris in 1848, and held that ofﬁce
four years. He Was a voluminous Writer, and his Works are interesting
and popular. His “Recollections of a Lifetime” Was published in 1857,
and “Peter Parley’s Own Story ” the year after his death.

The noisy robin sings no more;
The crow, his mountain haunt within,
Dreams ’mid the forest’s surly roar:
Good-night——good-night.

3. The sunlit cloud ﬂoats dim and pale;
The dew is falling soft and still,
The mist hangs trembling o’er the Vale,
And silence broods o’er yonder mill:
Grood—night——good-night.

4. The rose, so ruddy in the light,
Bends on its stem all rayless now;
And by its side a lily white,
A sister shadow, seems to bow:
Good night——good-night.

5. The bat may wheel on silent wing,
The fox his guilty Vigils keep,
The boding owl his dirges sing;
But love and innocence will sleep:
Good-night——good-night.

XXXI. AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL.

Louisa May Alcott (b. 1833, d. 1888) was born at Germantown, Pa.,
of New England parentage. Her parents afterwards returned to New
England, and most of her life was spent in Concord, Mass. During the
Civil War she Went to Washington and nursed the wounded and sick
until her own health gave Way. As a child she used to write stories for
the amusement of her playmates, and in 1857 published her ﬁrst book,
“Flower Fables.” Her ﬁrst novel, “Moods,” appeared in 1865. “Little
Women,” published in 1868, is a picture of her own home life. “ An Old-
Fashioned Girl,” from which this extract is adapted, was published in
1870, and is one of her most popular books.

1. POLLY hoped the “dreadful boy” (Tom) would not
be present; but he was, and stared at her all dinner-time
in a most trying manner.

2. Mr. Shaw, a busy-looking gentleman, said, “How do
you do, my dear? Hope you ’ll enjoy yourself; ” and then
appeared to forget her entirely. Mrs. Shaw, a pale, nerv-
ous woman, greeted her little guest kindly, and took care
that she wanted for nothing.

3. Madam Shaw, a quiet old lady, with an imposing cap,
exclaimed, on seeing Polly, “Bless my heart! the image

of her mother—a sweet woman-——how is she, dear?” and

kept peering at the 11ew-comer over her glasses till, be-
tween Madam and Tom, poor Polly lost her appetite.‘

4. Her cousin Fanny chatted like a magpie, and little
Maud ﬁdgeted, till Tom proposed to put her under the
big dish-cover, which produced such an explosion that
the young lady was borne screaming away by the much-
enduring nurse.

5. It was, altogether, an uncomfortable dinner, and Polly
was very glad when it was over. They all went about
their own affairs; and, after doing the honors of the house,
Fan was called to the dressmaker, leaving Polly to amuse
herself in the great drawing-room.

6. Polly was glad to be alone for a few minutes; and,
having examined all the pretty things about her, began to
walk up and down‘ over the soft, ﬂowery carpet, humming «

FIFTH READER. 1 1 1

to herself, as the daylight faded, and only the ruddy glow
of the ﬁre ﬁlled the room. I

7. Presently Madam came slowly in, and sat down in her
arm—chair, saying, “That ’s a ﬁne old tune; sing it to me,
my dear. I have n’t heard it this many a day.”

8. Polly did n’t like to sing before strangers, for she had
no teaching but such as her busy mother could give her;

but she had been taught the utmost respect for old people, .

and, having no reason for refusing, she directly went to the
piano and did as she was bid.

9. “That ’s the sort of music it ’s a pleasure to hear. 1

Sing some more, dear,” ‘said Madam, in her gentle way,
when she had done.

10. Pleased with this praise, Polly sang away in a fresh
little voice that went straight to the listener’s heart and
nestled there. The sweet old tunes that one is never tired
of were all Polly’s store. The more she sung, the better
she did it; and when she wound up with “A Health to
King Charlie,” the room quite rung with the stirring music
made by the big piano and the little maid.

T11. “ That ’s a jolly tune! Sing it again, please,” cried.

Tom’s voice; and there was Tom’s red head bobbing up over
the high back of the chair where he had hidden himself.
12. It gave Polly quite a turn, for she thought no one
was hearing her but the old lady dozing by the ﬁre. “I
can’t sing any more; I’m tired,” she said, and walked
away to Madam in the other room. The red head vanished

, like a meteor, for Polly’s tone had been decidedly cool.

I 13. The old lady put out her hand, and, drawing Polly
to her knee, looked into her face with such kind eyes that
Polly forgot the impressive cap, and smiled at her conﬁ-
dently; for she saw that her simple music had pleased
her listener, and she felt glad to know it.

14. “You mus’n’t mind my staring, dear,” said Madam,

I softly pinching her rosy cheek, “I have n’t seen a little girl

for so long, it does my old eyes good to look at you.”

Polly thought that a very odd speech, and could n’t help
saying, “Are n’t Fan and Maud little girls, too?”

15. “Oh, dear, no! not what I call little girls. Fan
has been a young lady this two years, and Maud is a
spoiled baby. Your mother ’s a very sensible woman, my
child.”

16. “What a queer old lady!” thought Polly; but she
said “ Yes ’m,” respectfully, and looked at the ﬁre. “ You
don’t understand what I mean, do you?” asked Madam,
still holding her by the chin. “No’m; not quite.”

17. “VVell, dear, I’ll tell you. In my day, children of
fourteen and ﬁfteen did n’t dress in the height of the
fashion; go to parties as nearly like those of grown people
as it’s possible to make them; lead idle, giddy, unhealthy
lives, and get blasé at twenty. We were little folks till
eighteen or so; worked and studied, dressed and played,
like children; honored our parents; and our days were
much longer in the land than now, it seems to me.”

18. The old lady appeared to forget Polly, at the end of
her speech; for she sat patting the plump little hand that
lay in her own, and looking up at a faded picture of an
old gentleman with a ruﬁled shirt and a queue. “ Was he
your father, Madam?”

19. “Yes, my dear; my honored father. I did up his
frills to the day of his death; and the ﬁrst money I ever
earned, was ﬁve dollars which he offered as a prize to which-

‘ ever of his six girls would lay the handsomest darn in his

silk stockings.”

'20. “How proud you must have been,” cried Polly,
leaning on the old lady’s knee with an interested face.

21. “ Yes; and we all learned to make bread, and cook,
and wore little chintz gowns, and were as gay and hearty
as kittens. All lived to be grandmothers; and I’m the

XXXII. MY MOTHER’S HANDS.

1. SUCH beautiful, beautiful hands!
They ’re neither white nor small;
And you, I know, would scarcely think
That they are fair at all.
I’ve looked on hands whose form and hue
A sculptor’s dream might be;
Yet are those aged, wrinkled hands
More beautiful to me.

2. Such beautiful, beautiful hands!
Though heart were weary and sad,
Those patient hands kept toiling on,
That the children might be glad.
I always weep, as, looking back
To childhood’s distant day,
I think how those hands rested not
Whell mine were at their play.

3. Such beautiful, beautiful hands!
They ’re growing feeble now,
For time and pain have~left their mark

On hands, and heart, and brow.
(5.—8.)

Alas! alas! the nearing time,
And the sad, sad day to me,

When ’neath the daisies, out of sight,
These hands will folded be.

4. But oh! beyond this shadow-land,

Where all is bright and fair,

I know full well these dear old hands
Will palms of victory bear;

Where crystal streams through endless years
Flow over golden sands,

And where the old grow young again,
I’ll clasp my mother’s hands.

writer of some note. In connection with her sister Ann, Jane Taylor
wrote several juvenile works of more than ordinary excellence. Among
them were “Hymns for Infant Minds ” and “Original Poems.” Besides
these, she Wrote “ Display, a Tale,” “ Essays in Rhyme,” and “ Contribu-
tions of Q,Q,.” Her writings are graceful, and often contain a useful moral.

Jane Taylor (b. 1783, d. 1824) was born in London. Her mother was a

1. AN old clock, that had stood for ﬁfty years in a farm-
er’s kitchen, without giving its owner any cause of com-
plaint, early one summer’s morning, before the family was
stirring, suddenly stopped. Upon this, the dial-plate (if we
may credit the fable) changed countenance with alarm; the
hands made a Vain effort to continue their course; the

wheels remained motionless with surprise; the weights hung ‘

speechless; and each member felt disposed to lay the blame
on the others. At length the dial instituted a formal in-
quiry as to the cause of the stagnation, when hands, wheels,
weights, with one voice, protested their innocence.

2. But now a faint tick was heard below from the pend-

  ulum, who spoke thus: “I confess myself to be the sole '

cause of the present stoppage; and I am willing, for the

FIFTH READER. 1 1 5

general satisfaction, to assign my reasons. The truth is,
that I am tired of ticking.” Upon hearing this, the old

clock became so enraged that it was upon the very point

of striking. “Lazy Wire!” exclaimed the dial-plate, hold-
ing up its hands. I

3. “Very good!” replied the pendulum; “it is vastly
easy for you, Mistress Dial, Who have always, as every

body knows, set yourself up above me,——it is vastly easy.

for you, I say, to accuse other people of laziness! you, who
have had nothing to do all your life but to stare people in
the face, and to amuse yourself with Watching all that
goes on in the kitchen. Think, I beseech you, how you
would like to be shut up for life in this dark closet, and
to Wag backward and forward year after year, as I do.”

4. “As to that,” said the dial, “is there 11ot a window,

in your house on purpose for you to look through?” “ For
all that,” resumed the pendulum, “it is very dark here;
and, although there is a window, I dare not stop even for
an instant to look out at it. Besides, I am really tired of
my Way of life; and, if you wish, I’ll tell you how I took
this disgust at my employment. I happened, this morn-
ing, to be calculating how many times I should have to
tick in the course of only the next twenty-four hours;
perhaps some one of you above there can give me th

. exact sum.” '

5. The minute hand being quick at ﬁgures, presently
replied, “ Eighty-six thousand four hundred times.” “ EX-
actly so,” replied the pendulum. “Well, I appeal to you
all, if the very thought of this was not enough to fatigue
any one; and when I began to multiply thelstrokes of one
day by those of months and years, really it was no Wonder
if I felt discouraged at the prospect. So, after a great deal
of reasoning and hesitation, thinks I to myself, I ’ll stop.”

6. The‘: dial could scarcely keep its countenance during
this harangue ; but, resuming its gravity, thus replied:
“Dear Mr. Pendulum, I am ‘really astonished that such

a useful, industrious person as yourself should have been
seized by this sudden weariness. It is true, you have done
a great deal of work in your time; so have we all, and
are likely to do; which, although it may fatigue us to
think of, the question is, whether it will fatigue us to do.
Would you now do me the favor to give about half a
dozen strokes to illustrate my argument?”

7. The pendulum complied, and ticked six times at its
usual pace. “ Now,” resumed the dial, “may I be allowed
to inquire if that exertion is at all fatiguing or disagree-
able to you?” “Not in the least,” replied the pendulum;
“it is not of six strokes that I complain, nor of sixty,
but of millions.”

8. “Very good,” replied the dial; “but recollect that,

although you may think of a million of strokes in an

instant, you are required to execute but one; and that,
however often you may hereafter have to swing, a moment
will always be given you to swing in.” “That consider-

ation staggers me, I confess,” said the pendulum.” “Then  

I hope,” resumed the dial-plate, “ that we shall all return

T to our duty immediately; for the maids will lie in bed if

we stand idling thus.”

9. Upon this, the weights, who had never been accused 3

of light conduct, used all their inﬂuence in urging him

q to proceed; when, as if with one consent, the wheels

began to turn, the hands began to move, the pendulum
began to swing, and, to its credit, ticked as loud as ever;
while a red beam of the rising sun, that streamed through
a hole in the kitchen, shining full upon the dial-plate, it
brightened up as if nothing had been the matter.

morning, upon looking at the clock, he declared that his
watch had gained half an hour in the night.

XXXIV. THE DEATH OF THE FLOWERS.

William Cullen Bryant (b. 1794, d. 1878) was born in Cummington,

Mass. He entered Williams College at the age of sixteen, but was hon-
orably dismissed at the end of two years. At the age of twenty-one he
was admitted to the bar, and practiced his profession successfully for
nine years. In 1826 he removed to New York, and became connected
with the “Evening Post ”—a connection which continued to the time
of his death. His residence for more than thirty of the last years of
his life was at Roslyn, Long Island. He visited Europe several times;
and, in 1849, he continued his travels into Egypt and Syria.

In all his poems, Mr. Bryant exhibits a remarkable love for, and a careful
study of, nature. His language, both in prose and verse, is always chaste,
correct, and elegant. “Thanatopsis,” perhaps the best known of all his
poems, was written when he was but nineteen. His excellent transla-
tions of the “Iliad ” and the “Odyssey” of Homer, and some of his best
poems were written after he had _passed the age of seventy. He retained
his powers and his activity till the close of his life.

1. THE melancholy days are come,
The saddest of the year,
Of wailing winds, and naked woods,
And meadows, brown and sear.
Heaped in the hollows of the grove,
The autumn leaves lie dead;

They rustle to the eddying gust,
And to the rabbit’s tread.

The robin and the wren are ﬂown,
And from the shrubs the jay,

And from the wood-top calls the crow
Through all the gloomy day.

2. Where are the ﬂowers, the fair young ﬂowers,
That lately sprang and stood
In brighter light and softer airs,
A beauteous sisterhood?

XXXV. THE THUNDER-STORM.

Washington Irving (b. 1783, d. 1859). This distinguished author, Whose
Works have enriched American literature, was born in the city of New
York. He had an ordinary school education, and began his literary
career, at the age of nineteen, by writing for a paper published by his
brother. His ﬁrst book, "Sa1magundi," was published in 1807. Two
years later he published “Knickerbocker’s History of New York." In
1815 he sailed for Europe, and remained abroad seventeen years. during
which time he Wrote several of his works. From 1842 to 1846 he was min-
ister to Spain. The last years of his life were passed at "Sunnys'1de,”
near Tarrytown, N. Y. He was never married. “The Life of Washing-
ton,” his last Work, was completed in the same year in which he died.
Mr. Irving’s Works are characterized by ‘humor, chaste sentiment, and
elegance and correctness of expression. The following selection is from
“Dolph ” in “ Bracebridge Hall.’’

1. IN the second day of the voyage, they came to the
Highlands. It was the latter part of a calm, sultry day,
that they ﬂoated gently with the tide between these stern
mountains. There was that perfect quiet which prevails
over nature in the languor of summer heat. The turning
of a plank, or the accidental falling of. an oar, on deck,
Was echoed from the mountain side and reverberated along
the shores ;' and, if by chance the captain gave a shout of

1 20 EOLECTIO SERIES

command, there were airy tongues that mocked it from
every cliﬁ”.

2. Dolph gazed about him, in mute delight and wonder,
at these scenes of nature’s magniﬁcence. To the left, the
Dunderberg reared its woody precipices, height over height,
forest over forest, away into the deep summer sky. To
the right strutted forth the bold promontory of Antony’s
Nose, with a solitary eagle wheeling about it; while be‘-
yond, mountain succeeded to mountain, until they seemed
to lock their arms together and conﬁne this mighty river
in their embraces.

3. In the midst of his admiration, Dolph remarked a
pile of bright, snowy clouds peering above the western

‘heights. It was succeeded by another, and another, each
seemingly pushing onward its predecessor, and towering,
with dazzling brilliancy, in the deep blue atmosphere;
and now muttering peals of thunder were faintly heard
rolling behind the mountains. The river, hitherto still
and glassy, reﬂecting pictures of the sky and land, now
showed a dark ripple at a distance, as the wind came
creeping up it. The ﬁsh hawks wheeled and screamed,
and sought their nests on the high, dry trees; the crows
ﬂew clamorously to the crevices of the rocks; and all
nature seemed conscious of the approaching thunder-gust.

9’, 4. The clouds now rolled in Volumes over the mountain
tops; their summits still bright and snowy, but the lower
parts of an inky blackness. The rain began to patter
down in broad and scattered drops; the wind freshened,
and curled up the waves; at length, it seemed as if the
bellying clouds were torn open by the mountain tops, and
complete torrents of rain came rattling down. The light-
ning leaped from cloud to cloud, and streamed quivering
against the rocks, splitting and rending the stoutest forest
trees. The thunder burst in tremendous explosions; the
peals were echoed from mountain to mountain; they
crashed upon Dunderberg, and then rolled up ' the long

FIFTH READER. 1 2 1

deﬁle of the Highlands, each headland making a new echo,
until old Bull Hill seemed to bellow back the storm.

5. For a time the scudding rack and mist and the
sheeted rain almost hid the landscape from the sight.
There was a fearful gloom, illumined still more fearfully
by the streams of lightning which glittered among the

‘rain-drops. Never had Dolph beheld such an absolute

warring of the elements; it seemed as if the storm was
tearing and rending its way through the mountain deﬁle,
and had brought all the artillery of heaven into action.

DEFINITIONS.——-1. Lar_1’guor (pro. lang’gwur), exhaustion of
strength, dullness. 3. Re-marked’, noticed, observed. Préd-e-<;és’-

York, bordering the Hudson River above Peekskill.

XXXVI. APRIL DAY.

Caroline Anne Southey (b. 1787, d. l854), the second wife of Southey
the poet, and better known as Caroline Bowles, was born near Lyming-
ton, Hampshire, England. Her ﬁrst Work, f‘ Ellen Fitz-Arthur,” a poem,

. was published in 1820; and for more than twenty years her writings were

published anonymously. In 1839 she was married to Mr. Southey, and
survived him over ten years. Her poetry is graceful in expression, and
full of tenderness, though somewhat melancholy. The following extract
ﬁrst appeared in 1822 in a collection entitled, “The Widow’s Tale, and
other Poems.” A

With shoots of tender green.

away in its own richness.———Oh! when did ever man make

2. But the sunlight that streamed through the window

revealed something fairer than the rose——a young lady
reclining on an ottoman, who was thus addressed by her
livelier cousin: “I say, cousin, I have been thinking what
you are to do with your pet rose when you go to New
York; as, to our consternation, you are determined to do.
You know it would be a sad pity to leave it with such a
scatter-brain as I am. I love ﬂowers, indeed,—that is, I

like a regular bouquet, cut off and tied up, to carry to a .

party; but as to all this tending and fussing which is need-
ful to keep them growing, I have no gifts in that line.”
3. “Make yourself easy as to that, Kate,” said Florence,
with a smile; “I have no intention of calling upon your
talents; I have an asylum in view for my favorite.”
4. “Oh, then you know just what I was going to say.

’Mrs. Marshall, I presume, has been speaking to you; she

was here yesterday, and I was quite pathetic upon the
subject; telling her the loss your favorite would sustain,
and so forth; and she said how delighted she would be
to have it in her green-house; it is in such a ﬁne state
now, so full of buds. I told her ‘I knew you would like
to give it to her; you are so fond of Mrs. Marshall, you
know.”

5. “Now, Kate, I am sorry, but I have otherwise en-
gaged.”

“Whom can it be to? you have so few intimates here.”

“ Oh, it is only one of my odd fancies.”

“But do tell me, Florence.”

“ Well, cousin, you know the little pale girl to whom we
give sewing?” F i

6. “What! little Mary Stephens? How absurd, Flor-
ence! This is just another of your motherly, old-maidish
ways; dressing dolls for poor children, making bonnets,
and knitting socks for all the little dirty babies in the
neighborhood. I do believe you have made more calls

ever you have in Chestnut Street, though you know every

body is half—dying to see you; and now, to crown all, you
must give this choice little bijou to a seamstress girl, when
one of your most intimate friends, in your own class, would
value it so highly. What in the world can people in their
circumstances want with ﬂowers?”

7. “Just the same as I do,” replied Florence, calmly.
“Have you not noticed that the little girl never comes
without looking wistfully at the opening buds? And don’t
you remember, the other morning she asked me so prettily
if I would let her mother come and see it, she was so fond
of ﬂowers?”

8., “But, Florence, only think of this rare ﬂower stand-
ing on a table with ham, eggs, cheese, and ﬂour, and stiﬂed
in that close little room, where Mrs. Stephens and her
daughter manage to wash, iron, and cook.”

9. “Well, Kate, and if I were obliged to live in one
coarse room, and wash, and iron, and cook, as you say;
if I had to spend every moment of my time in toil, with
no prospect from my window but a brick wall and a dirty
lane, such a ﬂower as ‘this would be untold enjoyment to
me.” p, ‘ ,

  “ Pshaw, Florence; all sentiment! Poor people have

7’ no time to be sentimental. Besides, I don’t believe it will

grow with them; it is a green-house ﬂower, and used to
delicate living.”

11. “Oh, as to that, a ﬂower never inquires whether its
owner is rich or poor; and poor Mrs. Stephens, whatever
else she has not, has sunshine of as good quality as this
that streams through our window. The beautiful things
that God makes are his gifts to all alike. You will see
that my fair rose will be as well and cheerful in Mrs.
Stephens’s room as in ours.”

12. “ Well, after all, how odd! When one gives to poor
people, one wants to give them something useful—a bushel
of potatoes, a ham, and such things.” ..

13. “ Why, certainly, potatoes and ham must be supplied;

but, having ministered to the ﬁrst and most craving wants,
why not add any other little pleasures or gratiﬁcations we
may have it in our power to bestow‘? I know there are
many of the poor who have ﬁne feeling and a keen sense
of the beautiful, which rusts out and dies because they are
too hard pressed to procure it any gratiﬁcation. Poor Mrs.
Stephens, for example; ‘I know she would enjoy birds, and
ﬂowers, and music as much as I do. I have seen her eye
light up as she looked upon these, things in our drawing-
room, and yet not one beautiful thing can she command.
From necessity, her room, her clothing,—all she has, must
be coarse and plain. You should have seen the almost
rapture she and Mary felt when I offered them my rose.”

14., “Dear me! all this may be true, but I never thought
of it before. I never ‘thought that these hard-working peo-
ple had any.ideas of taste!”

15. “Then why do you see the geranium or rose so care-
fully nursed in the old cracked tea-pot in the poorest room,
or the morning-glory planted in a box and twined about the
window? Do not these show that the human heart yearns
for the beautiful in all ranks of life? You remember, Kate,
how our washerwoman sat up a whole night, after a hard
day’s work, to make her ﬁrst baby a pretty dress to be bap-
tized in.” “Yes, and I remember Low I laughed at you
for making such a tasteful little cap for it.”

16. “True, Kate, but I think the look of perfect delight
with which the poor woman regarded her baby in its new

dress and cap was something quite worth creating; I do

believe she could not have felt more grateful if I had
sent her a barrel of ﬂour.”

17. “VVell, I never thought before of ‘giving any thing
to the poor but what they really needed, and I have
always been willing to do that when I could without

going far out of my way.”

18. “Ah! cousin, if our heavenly Father gave to us
after this mode, we should have only coarse, shapeless

SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES.

Subvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath
is more or less obstructed.

Aspirates consist of breath only, modiﬁed by the Vocal
organs.

Words ending with subvocal sounds should be selected for practice on
the subvocals; words beginning or ending with aspirate sounds may be

used for practice on the aspirates. Pronounce these words forcibly and‘

distinctly several times in succession; then drop the other sounds, and
repeat the subvocals and aspirates alone. Let the class repeat the
Words and elements, at ﬁrst, in concert; then separately.

REMARK.—TheSe sixteen sounds make eight pairs of cognates. In ar-
ticulating the aspirates, the vocal organs are put in the position re-
quired in the articulation of the corresponding subvocals; but the
breath is expelled with some force without the utterance of any vocal
sound. The pupil should ﬁrst verify this by experiment, and then
practice on these cognates. ,

The following subvocals and aspirates have no cognates.

XXXVIII. THE CATARACT OF LODORE.

1. “ How does the Water

Come down at Lodore?”

My little boy asked me
Thus once on a time; T

And, moreover, he tasked me
To tell him in rhyme.

2. Anon at the Word,
There ﬁrst came one daughter,
And then came another,-
To second and third
The request of their brother,
And to hear how the water
Comes down at Lodore,
With its rush and its roar,
As many a time
They had seen it before.

For of rhymes I had store,
And ’t was in my vocation
For their recreation

That so I should sing;

Because I was Laureate

In the tarn on the fell;
From its fountains

In its own little lake.

5. And thence at departing,
Awakening and starting, Q
It runs through the reeds,
And away it proceeds,
Through meadow and glade,
In sun and in shade,  
And through the wood-shelter,
Among crags in its ﬂurry,
Helter-skelter, ’
Hurry-skurry.

6. Here it comes sparkling,
And there it lies i darkling;
N ow smoking and frothing
Its tumult and wrath in,
Till, in this rapid race
On which it is bent,
It reaches the place

Of its_ steep descent.

XXXIX. THE BOBOLINK.

1. THE happiest bird of our spring, however, and one
that rivals the European lark in my estimation, is the bob-
lincoln, or bobolink as he is commonly called. He arrives
at that choice portion of our year which, in this latitude,
answers to the description of the month of May so often
given by the poets. With us it begins about the middle
of May, and lasts until nearly the middle of June. Earlier
than this, winter is apt to return on its traces, and to blight
the opening beauties of the year; and later than this, begin
the parc_l_1ing, and panting, and dissolving heats of summer.
But in this genial interval, Nature is in all her freshness
and fragrance: “the rains are over and gone, the ﬂowers '
appear upon the earth, the time of the singing of birds is
come, and the voices of the turtle is heard in the land.”

2. The trees are now in their fullest foliage and bright- °

est verdure; the woods are gay with the clustered ﬂowers
of thewlaurel; the air is perfumed with the sweet-brier
and the wild-rose; the meadows are enameled with clover-
blossoms; while the young apple, peach, and the plum
begin to swell, and the cherry to glow among the green
leaves.

3. This is the chosen season of revelry of the bobolink.
He comes amid the pomp and fragrance of the season;
his life seems all sensibility and enjoyment, all song and
sunshine. He is to be found in the soft bosoms of the
freshest and sweetest meadows, and is most in song when
the clover is in blossom. ,He perches on the topmost twig‘
of a tree, or on some long, ﬂaunting weed, and, as he rises
and sinks with the breeze, pours forth a succession of rich,‘
tinkling notes, crowding one upon another, like the outpour-
ing melody of the sky-lark, and possessing the same rapt-
urous character. .

4. Sometimes he pitches from the summit of a tree, be-

FIFTH READER. 133

gins his song as soon as he gets upon the wing, and ﬂutters
tremulously down to the earth, as if overcome with ecstasy
at his own music. Sometimes he is in pursuit of his mate;
always in full song, as if he would win her by his melody;
and always with the same appearance of intoxication and
delight,:. Of all the birds of our groves and meadows, the
bobolink was the envy of my boyhood. He crossed my

path in the sweetest weather, and the sweetest season of I

the year, when all nature called to the ﬁelds, and the
rural feeling throbbed in every bosom; but when I, luck-
less urchin! was doomed to be mewed up, during the live-
long day, in a school-room. ‘

5. It seemed as if the little varlet mocked at me as he

ﬂew by in full song, and sought to taunt me with his hap-
pier lot. Oh, how I envied him! No lessons, no task, no
school; nothing but holiday, frolic, green ﬁelds, and ﬁne

‘weather. Had I been then more versed in poetry, I might

have addressed him in the words of Logan to the cuckoo:

“Sweet bird, thy bower. is ever green,
Thy sky is ever clear;
Thou hast no sorrow in thy song,
No winter in thy year.

“Oh, could I ﬂy, I ’d ﬂy with thee!
I We ’d make, with joyful wing,
Our annual visit o’er the globe,
Companions of the spring.”

 6. Further observation and experience have given me

A a diﬁerent idea of this feathered voluptuary, which I will

venture to impart for the beneﬁt of my young readers, who
may regard him with the same unqualiﬁed envy and admi-
ration which I once indulged. I have shown him only as
I saw him at ﬁrst, in what I may call the poetical part of
his career, when he, in a manner, devoted himself to

- elegant pursuits and enjoyments, and was a bird of music,
and song, and taste, and sensibility, and reﬁnement. While I

134 EOLEOTIU SERIES.

this lasted he was sacred from injury; the very school-boy
would not ﬂing a stone at him, and the merest rustic would
pause to listen to his strain.

7. But markthe difference. As the year advances, as
the clover-blossoms disappear, and the spring fades into
summer, he gradually gives up his elegant tastes and
habits, doffs his poetical suit of black, assumes a russet,
dusty garb, and sinks to the gross enjoyment of common,
vulgar birds. His notes no longer vibrate on the ear;
he is stuﬂing himself with the seeds of the tall weeds on
which he lately swung and cha__nted so melodiously. He
has become a ban mlvcmt, a gourmiomd: with him now there
is nothing like the “joys of the table.” In a little while
he grows tired of plain, homely fare, and is off on a gas-
tronomic tour in quest of foreign luxuries.

8. We next hear of him, with myriads of his kind,
banqueting among the reeds of the Delaware, and grown
corpulent with good feeding. He has changed his name
in traveling. Boblincoln no more, he is the reed-bird now,
the much-sought-for tidbit of Pennsylvanian epicures, the
rival in unlucky fame of the ortolan! Wherever he goes,
pop! pop! pop! every rusty ﬁrelock in the country is

T blazing away. He sees his companions falling by thou-

sands around him. Does he take warning and reform?
Alas! not he. Again he wings his ﬂight. The rice-
swamps of the south invite him. He gorges himself
among them almost to bursting; he can scarcely ﬂy for
corpulency. He has once more changed his name, and is
now the famous rice-bird of the Carolinas. Last stage of

his career: behold him spitted, with dozens of his corpu-V

lent companions, and served up, a vaunted dish, on some
southern table. -

9. Such is the story of the bobolink; once spiritual,
musical, admired, the joy of the meadows, and the favorite
bird of spring; ﬁnally, a gross little sensualist, who expi-
ates his sensuality in the larder. His story contains a moral

Worthy the attention of all little birds and little bxoys;
Warning them to keep to those reﬁned and intellectual
pursuits which raised him to so high a pitch of popularity
during the early part of his career, but to eschew all
tendency to that gross and dissipated indulgence which
brought this mistaken little bird to an untimely end.

Brood, kind creature; you need not fear

‘Thieves and robbers While I am here.

One Weak chirp is her only note;
Braggart and prince of braggarts is he,

Pouring boasts from his little throat:

Never Was I afraid of man,
Catch me, cowardly knaves, if you can.

Six wide mouths are open for food;

Gathering seeds for the hungry brood.
“ Bob-o-link, bob-o-link,
Spink, spank, spink,
This new life is likely to be
Hard for a gay young fellow like me.
A Ghee, chee, chee.”

7. Robert of Lincoln at length is made
Sober with work, and silent with care;
Off is his holiday garment laid,
Half forgotten that merry air:
_ “ Bob-o-link, bob-o-link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Nobody knows but my mate and I
Where our nest and our nestlings lie.
Chee, chee, chee.”

8. Summer wanes; the children are grown;
Fun and frolic no more he knows;
Robert of Lincoln ’s a humdrum crone;
Off he ﬂies, and we sing as he goes:

“ Bob-o-link, bob-o-link,
Spink, spank, spink,
When you can pipe that merry old strain,
Robert of Lincoln, come back again.
Chee, chee, chee.”

XLI. REBELLION IN MASSACHUSETTS STATE-PRISON.

1. A MORE impressive exhibition of moral courage, op-
posed to the wildest ferocity under the most appalling cir-
cumstances, was never seen than that which was witnessed
by the officers of our state-prison, in the rebellion which

  occurred some years since. .

2. Three convicts had been sentenced, under the rules
of’ the prison, to be whipped in the yard, and, by some
effort of one of the other prisoners, a door had been opened
at midday communicating with the great dining-hall and,
through the Warden’s lodge, with the street.

3. The dining-hall was long, dark, and damp, from its
situation near the surface of the ground; and in this all
the prisoners assembled, with clubs and such other tools as
they could seize in passing through the workshops.

.4. Knives, hammers, and chisels, with every variety of
such weapons, were in the hands of the ferocious spirits,
who are drawn away from their encroachments on society,
forming a congregation of strength, vileness, and talent
that can hardly be equaled on earth, even among the
famed brigands of Italy. .

5. Men of all ages and characters, guilty of every variety
of infamous crime, dressed in the motley and peculiar garb
of the institution, and displaying the wild and demoniac
appearance that always pertains to imprisoned wretches,
were gathered together for the single purpose of preventing
the punishment which was to be inﬂicted on the morrow
upon their comrades.
ﬁt 6. The warden, the surgeon, and some other oﬂicers of
the prison were there at the time, and were alarlnled at
the consequences likely to ensue from the conﬂict" neces-
sary to restore order. They huddled together, and could
scarcely be said to consult, as the stoutest among them
lost all presence of mind in overwhelming fear. The news

FIFTH READER. 139

rapidly spread through the town, and a subordinate oﬂicer,
of the most mild and kind disposition, hurried to the scene,
and came calm and collected into the midst of the ofﬁcers.
The most equable-tempered and the mildest man in the
government was in this hour of peril the ﬁrmest.

7. He instantly dispatched a request to Major Wain-
right, commander of the marines stationed at the Navy

Yard, for assistance, and declared his purpose to enter ‘

into the hall and try the force of ﬁrm demeanor and per-
suasion upon the enraged multitude.

8. All his brethren exclaimed against an attempt so full
of hazard, but in vain. They offered him arms, a sword
and pistols, but he refused them, and said that he had no
fear, and, in case of danger, arms would do him no service;
and alone, with only a little rattan, which was his usual
Walking-stick, he advanced into the hall to hold parley
with the selected, congregated, and enraged villains of the
whole commonivealth.

9. He demanded their purpose in thus coming together
with arms, in violation of the prison laws. They replied
that they were determined to obtain the remission of the
punishment of their three comrades. He said !it was im-
possible; the rules of the prison must be obeyed, and they
must submit.

10. At the hint of submission they drew a little nearer
together, prepared their Weapons for service, and, as they
were dimly seen in the further end of the hall by those

. who observed from the gratings  opened up to the day,

a more appalling sight can not be, conceived, nor one of
more moral grandeur, than that of the single man stand-
ing Within their ‘grasp, and exposed to be torn limb from
limb instantly if a Word or look should add to the already
intense excitement. ‘

11. That excitement, too, was of a most dangerous kind.

‘ It broke not forth in noise and imprecations, but was seen

only in the dark looks and the strained nerves that showed

140 EOLEOTIO SERIES.

a deep determination. The oﬂicer expostulated. He re-‘

minded them of the hopelessness of escape; that the town
was alarmed, and that the government of the prison would
submit to nothing but unconditional surrender. He said
that all those. Who would go quietly away should be for-
given for this offense; but, that if every prisoner were
killed in the contest, power enough would be obtained to
enforce the regulations of the prison. .
-1. 12. They replied that they expected that some would
be killed,—that death would be better than such imprison-
ment; and, with that look and tone which bespeak an in-
domitable purpose, they declared that not a man should
leave the hall alive till the ﬂogging was remitted. At
this period of the discussion their evil passions seemed to
be more inﬂamed, and one or two offered to destroy the
ofﬁcer-, who still stood ﬁrmer and with a more temperate
pulse than did his friends, who sawpfrom above, but could
npgt avert, the danger that threatened him.

13. Just at this moment, and in about ﬁfteen minutes
from the commencement of the tumult, the oﬂicer saw the
feet of the marines,»on whose presence alone he relied for
succor, ﬁling by the small upper lights. Without any appar-
ent anxiety, he had repeatedly turned his attention to their
approach; and now he knew that it was his only time to
escape, before the conﬂict became, as was expected, one of
the most dark and dreadful in the world.

14. He stepped slowly backward, still urging them to de-
part before the oﬂicers were driven to use the ‘last resort
of ﬁre-arms. When within three or four feet of the door,
it was opened, and closed instantly again as he sprang
through, and was thus unexpectedly restored to his friends.

15. Major Wainright was requested to order his men to
ﬁre down upon "the convicts through the little windows, ﬁrst
with powder and then with ball, till they were willing to
retreat; but he took a wiser as well as a bolder course,
relying upon the effect which ﬁrm determination would have

FIFTH READER. _ 141
upon. men so critically situated. He ordered the door to
be again opened, and marched in at the head of twenty or
thirty men, who ﬁled through the passage, and formed at
the end of the hall opposite to the crowd of criminals hud-
dled together at the other.

16. He stated that he was empowered to quell the re-
bellion, that he wished to avoid shedding blood, but that

he would not quit that hall alive till every convict had

returned to his duty. They seemed balancing the strength
of the two parties, and replied that some of them were
ready to die, and only waited for an attack to see which
was the inore powerful; swearing that they would ﬁght to
the last,unless the punishment was remitted, for they would
not submit to any such punishment in the prison. Major
Wainright ordered his marines to load their pieces, and,
that they might not be suspected of triﬂing, each man was
made to hold up to view the bullet which he afterward
put in his gun.

Q 17. This only caused a growlof determination, and no
bne blenched or seemed disposed to shrink from the fore-
most exposure. They knew that their number would enable
them to bear down and destroy the handful of marines
after the first discharge, and before their pieces could be
reloaded. Again they were ordered to retire; but they
answered with more ferocity than ever. The marines were
ordered to take their aim so as to be sure and kill as
many as possible. Their guns were presented, but not a

I prisoner stirred, except to grasp more ﬁrmly his weapon.

18. Still desirous to avoid such a tremendous slaughter
as must have followed the discharge of a single gun, Major
Wainright advanced a step or two, and spoke even more
ﬁrmly than before, urging them to depart. Again, and
while looking directly into the muzzles of the guns which
they had seen loaded with ball, they declared their inten-
tion “to ﬁght it out.” This intrepid officer then took out
his watch, and told his men to hold their pieces aimed at

142 , EOLEOTIO SERIES.

the convicts, but not to ﬁre till they had orders; then,
turning to the prisoners, he said: “ You must leave this
hall; I give you three minutes to decide; if at the end of
that time a man remains, he shall be shot dead.”

19. N o situation of greater interest than this can be con-
ceived. At one end of the hall, a fearful multitude of the
most desperate and ‘powerful men in existence, waiting for
the assault; at the other, a little band of disciplined men,
waiting with arms presented, and ready-, upon the least mo-
tion or sign, to begin the carnage; and their tall and impos-
ing commander, holding up his watch to count the lapse
of three minutes, given as the reprieve to the lives of
hundreds. No poet or painter can conceive a spectacle
of more dark and terrible sublimity ; no human heart can
conceive a situation of more appalling suspense.

20. For two minutes not a person nor a muscle moved;
not a sound was heard in the unwonted stillness of the
prison, except the labored breathings of the infuriated
Wretches, as they began to pant between fear and revenge:
at the expiration of two minutes, during which they had
faced the ministers of death with unblenching eyes, two
or three of those in the rear, and nearest the further
entrance, went slowly out; a few more followed the exam-
ple, dropping out quietly and deliberately; and before half
of the last minute was gone, every man was struck by the
panic, and crowded for an exit, and the hall was cleared
as if by magic.

21. Thus the steady ﬁrmness of moral force and the
strong effect of determination, acting deliberately, awed
the most savage men, and suppressed a scene of carnage,
which would have instantly followed the least precipitancy

or exertion of physical force.

XLII. FAITHLESS NELLY GRAY.

Thomas Hood (b. 1798, Ct. 1845) was the son of aLondon book—se11er.
After leaving school he undertook to learn the art of an engraver, but
soon turned his attention to literature. In 1821 he became sub-editor
of the “London Magazine.” Hood is best known as a humorist; but
some of his poems are full of the tenderest pathos; and a gentle, humane
spirit pervades even his light-er productions. He Was poor, and during
the last years of his life suffered "much from ill-health. Some of his
most humorous pieces Were Written on a sick-bed.

1. BEN BATTLE was a soldier bold,
And used to War’s alarms;
But a cannon-ball took off his legs,
So he laid down his arms!

2. Now, as they bore him off’ the ﬁeld,
Said he, “Let others shoot,
For here I leave my second leg,
And the Forty-second Foot!”

3. The army surgeons made him limbs;
Said he, “They ’re only pegs:
But there ’s as Wooden members quite,
As represent my legs!”

Now Ben, he loved a pretty maid,
Her name was Nelly Gray;

So he went to pay her his devoirs,
When he ’d devoured his pay.

. But when he called on Nelly Gray,

She made him quite a scoff’;
And when she saw his wooden legs,
Began to take them oﬂ’!

. “O Nelly Gray! 0 Nelly Gray!

Is this your love so warm?
The love that loves a scarlet coat
Should be more uniform!”

. Said she, “I loved a soldier once,

For he was blithe and brave;
But I will never have a man
With both legs in the grave!

“Before you had these timber toes,
Your love I did allow,

But then, you know, you stand upon
Another footing now!”

. “O false and ﬁckle Nelly Gray!

I know why you refuse:
Though I’ve no feet———some other man
Is standing in my shoes!

“I wish I ne’er had seen your face;
But, now, a long farewell!

For you will be my death ;:-—alas!
You will not be my NELL ! ”

11. Now when he Went from Nelly Gray,
His heart so heavy got,
And life was such a burden grown,
It made him take a knot!

12. So, round his melancholyneck,
A rope he did nentwine,
And for the second time in life,
Enlisted in the Line!

13. One end he tied around a beam,
And then removed his pegs,
And, as his legs were off’, of course
He soon was off‘ his legs.

14. And there he hung, till he Was dead
As any nail in town:
For, though distress had cut him up,
It could not cut him down!

celebrate. merit, and ﬂattery extol’ the talents of the

great. “The short and simple annals of the poor ”

engross my pen; and while I record the history of Flor I

Silin’s virtues, though I speak of a poor peasant, Iishall
describe a noble man. ‘I ask no eloquence to assist me in
the task; modest worth rejects the aid of ornament to set
it off.

2. It is impossible, even at this distant period, to reﬂect
without horror on the miseries of that year known in
Lower Volga by the name of the “ famine year.” I re-
member the summer, whose scorching heats had dried up
all the ﬁelds, and the drought had no relief but from the
tears of the ruined farmer.

3. I remember the cold, comfortless autumn, and the
despairing rustics, crowding round their empty barns, with
folded arms and sorrowful countenances, pondering on their
misery, instead of rejoicing, as usual, at the golden har-
vest. I remember the winter which succeeded, and I re-
ﬂect with agony on the miseries it brought with it.
Whole families left their homes to become beggars on the
highway. ,

only shelter from the piercing winds and bitter frost. To
describe these scenes would be to harm. the feelings of my
readers; therefore, to my tale. In those days I lived on
an estate not far from Simbirsk; and, though but a child,
I have not forgotten the impression made on my mind by
the general calamity. 3

5. In a village adjoining lived Flor Silin, a poor, labor-
ing peasant: a man remarkable for his assiduity and the
skill and judgment with which be cultivated his lands.

. He was blessed with abundant crops; and his means

being larger than his wants, his granaries, even at this
time, Were full of corn. The dry year coming on had
beggared all the village except himself. Here was an
opportunity to grow rich. Mark how Flor Silin acted.
Having called the poorest of his neighbors about him, he
addressed them in the following man11er:

,6. “My friends, you want corn for your subsistence.
God has blessed me with abundance. Assist in ‘thrashing
out a quantity, and each of you take what he Wants for
his family.” The peasants were amazed at this unexam-
pled generosity; for sordid propensities exist. in the village
as Well as in the populous city.

7. The fame of Flor Silin’s benevolence having reached
other villages, the famished inhabitants presented them~
selves before him, and begged for corn. This good creature
received them as brothers; and, while his store remained,
afforded all relief. At length, his wife, seeing no end to
the generosity of his noble spirit, reminded him how neces-
sary it Would be to think of their own wants, and hold
his‘ lavish hand before it was too late. “It is Written .in
the Scripture,” said he, “ Give, and it shall be given unto
you.”

8. The following year Providence’ listened to the prayers
of the poor, and the harvest was abundant. The peasants
who had been saved from starving by Flor Silin now gath-
ered around him. r

9. “Behold,” said they, “the corn you lent us. You
saved our wives and children. We should have been
famished but for you; may God reward you; he only
can; all We have to give is our corn and grateful thanks.”
“I want no corn at present, my good neighbors,” said he;
“my harvest has exceeded all my expectations; for the
rest, thank heaven: I have been but an humble instru-
ment.”

10. They urged him in vain. “No,” said he, “I shall
not accept your corn. If you have superﬂuities, share

REMARK 1.-—In correcting errors of this kind in words of more than
one syllable, it is very important to avoid a fault which is the natural
consequence of an effort to articulate correctly. Thus, in endeavoring
to sound correctly the a in met’rz'c-al, the pupil is very apt to say met-
ric-al’, accenting the last syllable instead of the ﬁrst.

REMARK 2.—The teacher should bear it in mind that in correcting a
fault there is always danger of erring in the opposite extreme. Prop-
erly speaking, there is no danger of learning to articulate too distinctly,
but there is danger of making the obscure sounds too prominent, and
of reading in a slow, measured, and unnatural manner.

XLV. MRS. CAUDLE’S LECTURE.

Douglas Jerrold (b. 1803, d. 1857), was born in London. A midship-
man’s appointment was obtained for him, but he quit the naval service
in a few years. He was then apprenticed to a printer. By improving his
leisure hours he made himself master of several languages, and formed
the habit of expressing his thoughts in writing. An essay on the opera
of Der Freischiitz was his ﬁrst published literary production. Before he
was twenty-one years of age, he wrote “ Black-eyed Susan,” one of the

most popular dramas of modern times. Several other popular plays _

followed this. He was a regular contributor to the London “ Punch,”
from the second number, and edited, atidifferent times, several papers
and magazines. As a humorist, he occupies the ﬁrst rank. The most
noted of his works are his plays, and “Mrs. Caud1e’s Curtain Lectures,”
“ Saint Giles and Saint James,” “Bubbles of a Day,” and “Chronicles of
Clovernook.”

1. WELL, Mr. Caudle, I hope you ’re in a little better
temper than you were this morning. There, you need n’t
begin _.to whistle: people don’t come to bed to whistle.
But it ’s like you ; I can’t speak, that you do n’t try to
insult me. Once, I used to say you were the best creature
living: now, you get quite a ﬁend. Do let you rest? No,
I won’t let you rest. It ’s the only time I have to talk to
you, and you shall hear me. I’m put upon all day long:
it ’s very hard if I cant speak a word at night; besides, it
is n’t often I open my mouth, goodness knows! g

2. Because once in your life-time your shirt wanted a
button, you must almost swear the roof off the house.
You did n’t swear? Ha, Mr. Candle! you don’t know
what you do when you ’re in a passion. You were not
in a passion, wer’n’t you? Well, then, I don’t know
what a passion is; and I think I ought by this time.
I’ve lived long enough with you, Mr. Caudle, to know,
that.

3. It ’s a pity you hav’n’t something worse to complain
of than a button oil‘ your shirt. If you ’d some wives,
you would, I know. I’m sure I’m never without a needle
and thread in my hand; what with you and the chil-
dren, I ’m made a perfect slave of. And what ’s my

thanks? VVhy, if once in your life a button ’s off your
shirt—what do you cry “oh” at? I say once, Mr. Caudle;
or twice, or three times, at most. I’m sure, Caudle, no
man’s buttons in the world are better looked after than
yours. I only wish’ I’d kept the shirts you had when
you were ﬁrst married! I should like to know where
were your buttons then? ’  
I4. Yes, it is worth talking of! But that ’s how you
always try to put me down. You ﬂy into a rgge, and

then if I only try to speak, you wo11’t hear me. i That ’s A

how you» men always will have all ‘the talk to yourselves:
a poor woman is n’t allowed to get a word in. A nice
notion you have of a wife, to suppose she ’s nothing to
think of but her husband’s buttons. A pretty notion,
indeed, you have of marriage. Ha! if poor VVQIQBD only
knew what they had to go through!—what with buttons,
and one thing and another,——they ’d never tie themselves
up,——no, not to the best man in the world, I’m sure.
VVhat would they do, Mr. Caudle ?———Why, do much bet-
ter without you, I’m certain. I

5. And it ’s my belief, after all, that the button was n’t
off’ the shirt; it ’s my belief that you pulled it off, that
you might have something to talk about. Oh, you ’re
aggravating enough, when you like, for any thing! All
I know is, it ’s very odd that the button should be off
the ‘ shirt; for I ’m sure no wQ_man’s a greater slave to
her husband’s buttons than I am. I only say it ’s very
odd.

6. However, there ’s one comfort; it can’t last long.
I’m worn to death with your temper, and sha’n’t trouble
you a great while. I-Ia! you may laugh! And I dare
say you would laugh! I’ve no doubt of it! That ’s
your love; that ’s your feeling! I know that I’m sink-
ing every day, though I say nothing about it. And when
I’m gone we shall see how your second wife will look
after your buttons! You ’ll ﬁnd out the difference then.

FIFTH READER. 153

Yes, Caudle, you ’ll think of me then; for then, I hope,
you ’ll never have a blessed button to your back.

7. No, I’m not a vindictive woman, Mr. Caudle: no-
body ever called me that but you. What do you say?
Nobody ever knew so much of me? That ’s nothing at all
to do with it. Ha! I would n’t have your aggravating
temper, Caudle, for mines of gold. It ’s a good thing

I’m not as worrying as you are, or a nice house there ’d y

be between us. I only wish you ’d had a wife that would
have talked to you! Then you ’d have known the "differ-
ence. But you impose upon me because, like a poor fool,
I say nothing. I should be ashamed of myself, Candle.

8. And a pretty example you set as a father! You ’ll
make your boys.as bad as yourself. Talking as you did
all breakfast-time about your buttons! and of a Sunday
morning, too! And "you call yourself a Christian! I
should like to know what your boys will say of you when
they grow up! And all about a paltry button off one of
your wristbands! A decent man would n’t have men-
tioned it. Why do n’t I hold my tongue? Because I won’t
hold my tongue. I’m to have my peace of mind de-
stroyed—I ’m to be worried into my grave for a miserable
shirt button, and I’m to‘ hold my tongue! Oh! but
that ’s just like you men!

9. But I know what I’l1. do for the future. Every.

button you have may drop off, and I won’t so much as
put a thread to ’em. And I should like to know what

H you ’ll do then! Oh, you must get somebody else to sew ’em,

must you? That ’s a pretty threat for a husband to hold
out to his wife! And to such a wife as I’ve been, too:
such a slave to your buttons, as I may say. Somebody
else to sew ’em, eh? No, Caudle, -no; not while I’m alive!
When I’m dead——and, with what I have to bear, there ’s

‘no knowing how soon that may be———when I’m dead, I
' say—'-—oh! what a brute you must be to snore so!

say; but that ’s nothing to do with it. You must get
somebody else to sew ’em, must you? Ha! I should n’t
wonder. Oh, no! I should be surprised at nothing now!
Nothing at all! It ’s what people have always told me it
would come to; and now the buttons have opened my eyes!
But the whole world shall know of your cruelty, Mr.
Caudle. After the wife I’ve been to you. Caudle, you ’ve

1. UNDER a spreading chestnut-tree
The village smithy stands;
The smith, a mighty man is he,
With large and sinewy hands;
And the muscles of his brawny arms
Are strong as iron bands.  

2. His hair is crisp, and black, and long,

His face is like the tan;

His brow is wet with honest sweat,
He earns whate’er he can,

And looks the whole world in the face,
For he owes not any man.

3. Week in, week out, from morn till night,
You can hear his bellows blow;
You can hear him swing? his heavy sledge,
VVith measured beat and slow,
Like a sextoxf ringing the Village bell,
When the evening sun is low.

Look in at the open door;

They love to see the ﬂaming forge,
And hear the bellows roar,

And catch the burning sparks that ﬂy

And sits among his boys;
He hears the parson pray and preach,
He hears his daughter’s voice,

And it makes his heart rejoice.

Singing in Paradise!

He needs must think of her once more,
How in the grave she lies;

And with his hard, rough hand he wipes
A tear out of his eyes.

. Toiling,— rej oicing,— sorrowing,

Onward through life he goes;

Each morning sees some task Begin,
Each evening sees it close;

Something attempted, something done,
Has earned a night’s repose.

. Thanks, thanks to thee, my Worthy friend,

For the lesson thou hast taught!
Thus at the ﬂaming forge of life
Our fortunes must be Wrought;

'Thus on its sounding anvil shaped

Each burning deed and thought!

XLVII. THE RELIEF OF LUCKNOW.

[From a letter to the London Times, by a lady, the wife of an
officer at Lucknow.]

1. ON every side ,de‘a/th Sl3a\f‘€(.l us in the face; no human
skill could avert it any longer. VVe saw the moment
approach when- we must bid farewell to earth, yet without
feeling that unutterable horror which must have been
experienced by the unhappy victims at Cawnpore. We
were resolved rather to die than to yield, and were fully
persuaded that in twenty-four hours all would be over.
The engineer had said so, and all knew the worst. We
women strove to encourage each other, and to perform
the light duties which had been assigned to us, such as
conveying orders to the batteries, and supplying the men
with provisions, especially cups of coffee, which we pre-
pared day and night.

2. I had gone out to try to make myself useful, in
company with Jessie Brown, the wife of a corporal in
my husband’s regiment. Poor Jessie had been in a state
of restless excitement all through the siege, and had fallen
away visibly within the last few days. A constant fever
consumed her, and her mind wandered occasionally, espe-
cially that day, when the recollections of home seemed
powerfully present to her. At last, overcome with fatigue,
she lay down on the ground, wrapped up in her plaid.
I sat beside her, promising to awaken her when, as she

._.\ A said, her “father should return from the plowing.”

3. She fell at length into a profound slumber, motionless
and apparently breathless, her head resting in my lap. I
myself could no longer resist the inclination to sleep, iii
spite of the continual roar of the cannon. Suddenly I
was aroused by a wild, unearthly scream close to my ear;
my companion stood upright beside me, her arms raised,
and her head bent forward in the attitude of listening.

FIFTH READER. 157

4. A look of intense delight broke over her countenance;
h d h d ‘/d d h ° -
s e graspe my an ,. rew me towar er, and exclaimed.
“Dinna ye hear it? dinna ye hear it? Ay. I’m no dream-
ing: it ’s the slogan o’ the Highlanders! We ’re saved!
we ’re saved!” Then ﬂinging herself on her knees, she
thanked God with passionate fervor. I felt utterly be-
wildered; my English ears heard only the roar of ar-

tillery, and I thought my poor Jessie was still raving;

but she darted to the batteries, and I heard her cry in-
cessantly to the men, “ Courage! courage! Hark to the
slogan——to the Macgregor, the grandest of them a’! Here’s

hggp at last!”
 . To describe the effect of these words upon the soldiers

would be impossible. For a moment they ceased ﬁring,
and every soul listened with intense anxiety. Gradually,
however, there arose a murmur of bitter disappointment,
and the wailing of the women, who had ﬂocked to the
spot, burst out anew as the colonel shook his head. Our
dull Lowland ears heard only the rattle of the musketry.
A few moments more of this death-like suspense, of this
agonizing hope, and Jessie, who had again sunk on the
ground, sprang to her feet, and cried in a voice so clear
and piercing that it was heard along the whole line, “VVill
ye no believe it noo? The slogan has ceased, indeed, but
the Campbells are comiif’/! D’ ye hear? cl’ ye hear?”

‘6. At that moment all seemed indeed to hear the voice
of God in the distance, when the pibroch of the High-
landers brought us tidings of deliverance; for now there
was no longer any doubt of the fact. That shrill, pene-
trating, ceaseless sound, which rose above all other sounds,
could come neither from the advance of the enemy nor
from the work of the sappers. No, it was indeed the
blast of the Scottish bagpipes, now shrill a11d harsh, as
threatening vengeance on the foe, then in softer tones,
seeming to promise succor to their friends in need.

XLVIII. THE SNOW-STORM.

James Thomson (b. 1700, d. 1748) was born at Ednam, in the_shire of
Roxburgh,'Scotland. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh,
and afterwards studied for the ministry, but in a short time changed his
plans and devoted himself to literature. His early poems are quite insig-
niﬁcant, but “ The Seasons,” from which the following selection is taken,
and the “Castle of Indolence,” are masterpieces of English poetry.

1. THROUGH the hushed air the whitening shower descends,

At ﬁrst thin wavering; till at last the ﬂakes

Fall broad and wide and fast, dimming the day,

With a continual flow; The cherished ﬁelds

Put on their winter-robe of purest white.

’T is brightness all: save where the new snow melts
Along the mazy current.

2. Low the woods
Bow their hoar head; and ere the languid sun
Faint from the west emits its evening ray,
Earth’s universal face, deep-hid and chill,

Is one wild dazzling waste, that buries wide
The works of man.

0

3. Drooping,the laborer-ox
Stands covered o’er with snow, and then demands
The fruit of all his toil. The fowls of heaven,
Tamed by the cruel season, crowd around
The winnowing store, and claim the little boon
Which Providence assigns them.

4. One alone,
The Redbreast, sacred to the household gods,
Wisely regardful of the embroiling sky,

In joyless ﬁelds and thorny thickets leaves
His shivering mates, and pays to trusted man
His annual visit. -

5. Half-afraid, he first
Against the window beats; then, brisk, alights
On the warm hearth; then, hopping o’er the ﬂoor,
Eyes all the smiling family askance,

And pecks, and starts, and wonders where he is;
Till, more familiar grown, the table-crumbs
Attract his slender feet.

6. The foodless wilds

Pour forth their brown inhabitants. The hare,
Though timorous of heart, and hard beset

By death in various forms, dark snares and dogs,
And more unpitying men, the garden seeks,

Urged on by fearless want. The bleating kind

Eye the bleak heaven, and next the glistening earth,
With looks of dumb despair; then, sad dispersed,
Dig for the withered herb through heaps of snow.

7. Now, shepherds, to your helpless charge be kind,

Baﬁle the raging year, and ﬁll their pens

With foodat will; lodge them below the storm,
And watch them strict; for from the bellowing east,
In this dire season, oft the whirlwind’s wing

Sweeps up the burden of whole wintry plains

In one wide waft, and o’er the hapless ﬂocks,

Hid in the hollow of two neighboring hills,

The billowy tempest i’whelms; till, upward urged,
The valley to a shining mountain swells,

Tipped with a wreath high-curling in the sky.

XLIX. BEiHIND TIME.

1. A RAILROAD train was rushing along at almost light-
ning speed. A curve was just ahead, beyond which was a
station where two trains usually met. The conductor was
late,——so late that the period during which the up-train was
to wait had nearly elapsed; but he hoped yet to pass the
curve safely. Suddenly a locomotive dashed into sight
right ahead. In an instant there was a collision. A
shriek, a shock, and ﬁfty souls were in eternity; and all
because an engineer had been behind time.

2.. A great battle was going on. Column after column
had been preci~_p_iWtated for eight hours on the enemy posted
along the ridge of a hill. The summer sun was sinking in
the west; re-enforcements for the obstinate defenders were
already in sight; it was necessary  carry the position
“with one ﬁnal charge, or every thing would be lost:

3. A powerful corps had been summoned from across

the country, and if it came up in season all would yet be
well. The" great conqueror, conﬁdent in its arrival, formed
his reserve into an attacking column, and ordered them to
charge the enemy. The whole world knows the result.

back; and Waterloo was lost. Napoleon died a prisoner
at St. Helena because one of his marshals was behind time.

4. All leading ﬁrm in commercial circles had long strug-
gled against banl§r_uptcy. As it had large sums of money
in California, it expected remittances by a certain day, and

. if they arrived, its credit, its honor, and its future pros-

perity would be preserved. But week after week elapsed
without bringing the gold. At last came the fatal day on
which the ﬁrm had bills maturing to large amounts. The
steamer was telegraphed at day-break; but it was found,
on inquiry, that she brought no funds, and the house
failed. The next arrival brought nearly half a million to
the insolvents, but it was too late; they were ruined be-
cause their agent, in remitting, had been behind time.

5. A conde_mned man was led out for execution. He
had taken human life, but under circumstances of the
greatest provocation, and public sympathy was active in
his behalf. Thousands had signed petitions for a reprieve ;
a favorable answer had been expected the night before, and
though it had not come, even the sheriff felt conﬁdent
that it would yet arrive. Thus the morning passed without
the appearance of the messenger.

6. The last moment was up. The prisoner took his place,
the cap was drawn over his eyes, the bolt was drawn, and
a lifeless body swung revolving in the wind. Just at that
moment a horseman came into sight, galloping down hill,
his steed covered with foam. He carried a packet in his
right hand, which he waved frant_ically to the crowd. He
was the express rider with the reprieve; but he came too
late. A comparatively innocent man had died an igno-
minious death because a watch had been ﬁve minutes too
late, making its bearer arrive behind time..

 . It is continually so in life. The best laid plans, the
most important affairs, the fortunes of individuals, the weal.
of nations, honor, happiness, life itself, are daily sacriﬁced,
because somebody is “behind time.” There are men who

always fail in whatever they undertake, simply because
they are “behind time.” ‘There are others who put off
reformation year after year, till death seizes them, and
they perish unrepentant, because forever “ behind time.”

French under N apoleon, and the English, Netherland, and Ger-

, Napoleon Bonaparte (b. 1769, d. 1821) was born on the island
of Corsica. At school he was “studious, well-behaved, and dis-
tinguished in mathematical studies.” In 1785 he was commis-
sioned as a sub-lieutenant in the army. From this obscure
position he raised himself to the head of the army, and in
1804 was elected emperor of the French. He is almost uni-
versally acknowledged to have been the greatest general the
world has known.

And beside thee kneel in prayer.

LIII. THE HOUR OF PRAYER.

Felicia Dorothea Hemans (b.1794, d. 1835) was born in Liverpool, En-
gland. Her maiden name was Browne. Her childhood was spent 111
Wales. Her ﬁrst volume of poems was published in 1808; her second in
1812. In 1812 she was married to Captain Hemans, but he left her about
six years after their marriage, and they never again lived together. She
then went, with her ﬁve sons, to reside with her mother, then living near

St. Asaph, in North Wales. Mrs. Hemans now resumed her literary pur-.

suits, and wrote much and well. Her poetry is smooth and graceful, and

' she excels in description. Many of her poems are exceedingly beautiful.

1. CHILD, amid the ﬂowers at play,
Wliile the red light fades away;
Mother, with thine earnest eye,
Ever following silently;

Father, by the breeze at eve

Called thy harvest work to leave;
Pray! Ere yet the dark hours be,
Lift the heart, and bend the knee.

2. Traveler, in the stranger’s land,

Far from thine own household band;
Mourner, haunted by the tone

Of a voice from this world gone;
Captive, in whose narrow cell
Sunshine hath not leave to dwell;
Sailor, on the darkening sea;

Lift the heart and bend the knee.

3. Warrior, that from battle won,
Breathest now at set of sun;
Woman, o’er the lowly slain
Weeping on his burial plain;

Kindred by one holy tie,
Heaven’s ﬁrst star alike ye see;
Lift the heart, and bend’ the knee.

LV. THE NOSE AND THE EYES.

William Cowper (b. 1731, d. 1800) was the son of an English clergyman,
and was born in Great Berkhampstead, Hertfordshire, England. He was
sent to Westminster School when he was ten years of age, and he re-
mained there, a diligent student, eight years. He then studied law, and
was admitted to the bar, but he never practiced his profession. He was
appointed to a clerkship in the House of Lords when he was about thirty
years old, but he never entered upon the discharge of his duties. He be-
came insane, and was sent to a private asylum. After his recovery, he
found a home in the family of the Rev. Mr. Unwin. On the death of this
gentleman, he resided with the widow till her death-—most of the time at
Olney. His ﬁrst Writings were published in 1782. _‘‘The Task,” some
hymns, a number of minor poems, and his translations of Homer
composed his published works. His ‘insanity returned at times, and
darkened a pure and gentle life at its close.

BETWEEN Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose;.
The spectacles set them, unhappily, wrong;

The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,
To which the said spectacles ought to belong.

'2. So Tongue was the lawyer, and argued the cause,
With a great deal of skill, and a wig full of learning,
While chief baron Ear _sat to balance the laws,
So famed for his talent in nicely discerning.

“In behalf of the Nose, it will quickly appear,
And your lordship,” he said, “will undoubtedly ﬁnd
That the Nose has the spectacles always to wear,
Which amounts to possession, time out of mind.”

4. Then, holding the spectacles up to the court,
“ Your lordship observes, they are made with a straddle
As wide as the ridge of the Nose is; in short,
Designed to sit close to it, just like a saddle.

5. “Again, would your lordship a moment suppose
(’Tis a case that has happened, and may happen again,)

That the visage or countenance had not a Nose,
Pray, who would or who could wear spectacles then?

FIFTH READER. V 177

6. “On the whole it appears, and my argument shows,
With a reasoning the court will never condemn,

That the spectacles, plainly, were made for the Nose,

And the Nose was, as plainly, intended for them.”

7. Then shifting his side (as a lawyer knows how),
He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes:
But what were his arguments, few people know,
For the court did not think them equally wise.

8. So his lordship decreed, with a grave, solemn tone,
Decisive and clear, without one if or but,
That whenever the Nose ‘put his spectacles on,
By daylight or candle—light,—Eyes should be shut.

LVI. AN ICEBERG.

Louis Legrand Noble (b. 1812, ) was born in Otsego County, New
York. When twelve years of age, he removed with his family to the
wilds of Michigan, but after the death of his father he returned to New
York to study for the ministry, which he entered in 1840. About this
time he published his ﬁrst productions, two Indian romances in the form
of poems, entitled “ Pewatem ” and “ N imahmin.” Mr. Noble lived for a
time in ‘North Carolina, and later at Catskill on the Hudson, where he
became a warm friend of the artist Cole. After the latter’s death he
wrote a memorial of him. Other works of this author are “ The Hours,
and other Poems,” and “ After Icebergs with a Painter,” from which this
selection is taken.

1. WE have just passed a fragment of some one of the

2. The bear, a ten-foot mass in tolerable proportion,
seemed to be regularly beset by a pack of hungry little
swells. First, one would take him on the hau ch, then
Whip back into the sea over histail and between his legs.
Presently a bolder swell would rise and pitch into his

back with a ferocity that threatened instant destruction.

It only washed his satin ﬂeece thewhiter.

3. While Bruin was turning to look the daring assailant
in the face, the rogue had pitched himself back into his
cave. No sooner that, than a very bull-dog of a billow
would attack him in the face. The serenity with which
the impertinent assault was borne was complete. It was

‘ but a puff of silvery dust, powdering his mane with fresher

brightness. Nothing would be left of bull but a little froth
of all the foam displayed in the ﬁerceonset. He too would
turn and scud into his hiding—place. ‘Km

4. Persistent little waves! After a dash, singly, all
around, upon the common enemy, as if by some silent
agreement under water, they would all rush on at once,
with their loudest roar and shaggiest foam, and overwhelm
poor bear so completely that nothing less might be ex-
pected than to behold him broken in four quarters, and
ﬂoating helplessly asunder. Mistaken spectators! Although‘,
by his momentary rolling and plunging, he was evidently
aroused, yet, neither Bruin nor his burrow wé§i'e at all the
worse for all the wear and washing._

colors them also. She is no monochromist, but polychroic,
imparting such touches of dove-tints, emerald, and azure
as she bestows upon her gems and skies.

6. We are bearing up under the big berg as closely
as we dare. To our delight, what we have been wishing
and watching for is actually taking place: loud explosions,
with heavy falls of ice, followed by the cataract-like roar, and
the high,‘thin seas, wheeling away beautifully crested with
sparkling foam. If- it is possible, imagine the effect upon
the beholder: this precipice of ice, with tremendous crack-
ing, is falling toward us with a majestic and awful motion.

7. Down sinks the long water-line into the black deep;
down go the porcelain crags and galleries of glassy sculpt-

ure—a speechless ‘and awful baptism. Now it pauses, and

returns: up rise sculptures and crags streaming with the
shining white brine; up comes the great encircling line,
followed by things new and strange———-crags, niches, bal-
conies, and caves; up, up it rises, higher, and higher still,
crossing the very breast of the grand ice, and all bathed
with rivulets of gleaming foam. Over goes the summit,
ridge, pinnacles, and all, standing off obliquely in the
opposite air. Now it pauses in its upward roll: back it
comes again, cracking, cracking, cracking, “ groaning out
harsh thunder” as it comes, and threatening to burst, like
a mighty bomb, into millions of glittering fragments. The
spectacle is terriﬁc and magniﬁcent. Emotion is irrepress-
ible, and peals of wild hurrah burst forth from all.

LVII. ABOUT QUAIL.

William Post Hawes (b. 1803, d. 1842) was born in New York City, and
was a graduate of Columbia College. He was a lawyer by profession.

His writings consist mainly of essays, contributed to various newspapers‘

and magazines, and show great descriptive power. He was a frequent
contributor to the “Spirit of the Times,” under the title of “Cypress, J r.,”
on various sporting topics. After his death a collection of his writings
was published in two volumes, entitled, “Sporting Scenes” and “ Sundry
Sketches.” ~ ’

1. THE quail is peculiarly a domestic bird, and is at-
tached to his birthplace and the home of his forefathers.
The various members of the aquatic families educate their
children in the cool summer of the far north, and bathe
their Warm bosoms in July in the iced waters of Hudson
Bay; but when Boreas scatters the rushes where they had
buil_ded their bed-chambers, they desert their fatherland,
and ﬂy to disport in the sunny waters of the south.

2. The songsters of the woodland, when their customary
crops of insects and berries are cut oﬂ‘ in the fall, gather
themselves to renew their loves and get married in more
genial climes. Presently, the groves so vocal, and the sky
so full, shall be silent and barren. The “melancholy days”
Will soon be here; only thou, dear Bob White, wilt remain.

3. The quail is the bird for me. He is no rover, no
emigrant. He stays at home, and is identiﬁed with the
soil. Where the farmer Works, he lives, and loves, and
Whistles. In budding spring-time, and in scomhing sum-
mer——in bounteous autumn, and in barren winter, his voice
is heard from the same bushy hedge fence, and from his
customary cedars. Cupidity and cruelty may drive him

  to the woods, and to seek more quiet seats; but be merci-

ful and kind to him, and he will visit your barn-yard, and
sing for you upon the boughs of the apple-tree by your
gateway.‘ '

open and receive her breath, then begin the cares and re-

sponsibilities of wedded life. Away ﬂy the happy pair to
seek some grassy tussock, Where, safe from the eye of the
hawk and the nose of the fox, they may rear their ex-
pectant brood in ‘peace. ’

3' 5. Oats harvest arrives, and the ﬁelds are waving with

yellow grain. Now be wary, O kind-hearted cradler, and
tread not into those pure white eggs ready to burst with
life! Soon there is a peeping sound heard, and lo! a
proud mother walketh magniﬁcently in the midst of her
children, scratching and picking, and teaching them how
to swallow. Happy she, if she may be permitted to bring
them up to maturity, and uncompelled to renew her joys
in another nest. .

. 6. The assiduities of a mother have a ‘beauty and a
sacredness about them that command respect and rever-
ence in all animal nature, human or inhuman——what a lie
does that word carry——eXcept, perhaps, in monsters, insects,
and ﬁsh. I never yet heard of the parental tenderness of
a trout, eating up his little baby, nor of the ﬁlial gratitude
of a spider, nipping the life out of his gray-headed father,
and usurping his web.

 7. But if you would see the purest, the sincerest, the
most affecting piety of a parent’s love, startle a young
family of quails, and watch the conduct of the mother.
She will not leave you. No, not she. But she will fall
at your feet, uttering a noise which none but a distressed
mother can make, and she will run, and ﬂutter, and seem
to try to be caught, and cheat your outstretched hand,
and aﬂ"ect to be wing-broken and wounded, and yet have
just strength to tumble along, until she has drawn you,
fatigued, a safe distance from her threatened children and
the young hopes of her heart; and then will she mount,
whirring with glad strength, and away through the maze
of trees you have not seen before, like a close-shot bullet,
ﬂy to her skulking infants.

"a 8. Listen now. Do you hear those’ three half‘-plaintive
notes, quickly, and clearly poured out? She is calling the
boys and girls together. She sings not now “ Bob White!”
nor “Ah! Bob White‘! ” That is her husband’s love-call,
or his trumpet-blast of deﬁance. But she’ calls sweetly and

softly for her lost children. Hear them “Peep! peep!
peep!” at the welcome voice of their mother’s love! They
are coming together. Soon the whole family will meet
again.

9. It is a fgul sin to disturb them; but retread your
devious way, and let her hear your coming footsteps,
breaking down the briers, as you renew, the danger. She

is quiet. Not a word is passed between the fearful fugi- !

tives. Now, if you have the heart to do it, lie low, keep
still, and imitate the call of the hen-quail. 0 mother!
mother! how your heart would die if you could witness

say, “Where is she‘? Mother! mother! we are here!”

LIX. THE MACHINIST’S RETURN.

[Adapted from a letter written by a correspondent of the
Washington “ Capital.”]

1. ON our Way from Springﬁeld to Boston, a stout,
black-whiskered man sat immediately in front of me,— in
the drawing-room car, whose maneuvers were a source of
constant amusement. He would get up every ﬁve min-
utes, hurry away to the narrow passage leading to the

135 EOLEOTIO SERIES.

door of the car, and commence laughing in the most vio-
lent manner, continuing that healthful exercise until he
observed that some one was watching him, when he would
return to his seat.

2. As we 11eared Boston these demonstrations increased
in frequency and violence, but the stranger kept his seat‘

and chuckled to himself. He shifted the position of his «

two portmanteaus, or placed them on the seat as if he was
getting ready to leave. As we were at least twenty-ﬁve
miles from Boston, such early preparations seemed ex-
tremely ridiculous. He became so excited at last that he
couldnot keep his secret. Some one must be made a con-
ﬁdant; and as I happened to be the nearest to him, he se-
lected me.

3. Turning around suddenly, and rocking himself to and
fro in his chair, he said, “I have been away from home
three years. Have been in Europe. My folks don’t ex-
pect me for three months yet, but I got through and
started. I telegraphed them at the last station—they’ve
got the dispatch by this time.”. As he said this he
rubbed his hands, and changed the portmanteau on his
left to the right, and then the one on the right to the
left.

4. “Have you a wife?” said I. “Yes, and three chil-
dren,” was the answer. He then got up and folded his
overcoat anew, and hung it over the back of the seat.

~ “You are somewhat nervous just now, are you not?”

said I.

5. “Well, I should think so,” he replied. “I have n’t
slept soundly for a week. Do you know,” he went on,
speaking in a low tone, “I am almost certain this train
will run off the track and break my neck before I get to
Boston. I have had too much good luck lately for one
man. It can’t last. It rains so hard, sometimes, that you
think it’s never going to stop; then it shines so bright you
think it ’s always going to shine; and just as you are set-

FIFTH REA DEE. 137

tl_ed in either belief, you are knocked over by a change, to
show you that you know nothing about it.”

6. “Well, according to your philosophy,” I said, “you
will continue to have sunshine because you are expecting
a storm.” “Perhaps so,” he replied; “but it is curious

that the only thing which makes me think I shall get

through safe is, I fear that I shall not.”

7. “I am a machinist,” he "continued; “I made a dis-‘

covery; nobody believed in it; I spent all my money in
trying to bring it out; I mortgaged my home——every
thing ‘went. Every body laughed at me——every body but
my wife.‘ She said she would work her ﬁngers off before I
should give it up. I went to England. At ﬁrst I met
with no encouragement whatever, and came very near
jumping off London bridge. I went into a workshop to
earn money enough to come home with: there I met the
man I wanted. To make a long story short, I’ve brought
home £50,000 with me, and here I am.” I

8. “Good!” I exclaimed. “Yes,” said he, “and the
best of it is, she knows nothing about it. She has. been
disappointed so often that I concluded I would not write
to her about my unexpected good luck. When I got my
money, though, I started for home at once.”
 “And now, I suppose, you will make her happy?”
‘ Happy!” he replied; “ why, you don’t know any thing
about it! She ’s worked night and day since I have
been in England, trying to support herself and the chil-
dren decently. They paid her thirteen cents apiece for
making shirts, and that’s the way she has lived half the
time. She ’ll come down to the depot to meet me in a
gingham dress and a shawl a hundred years old, and she’ll
think she ’s dressed up! Perhaps she won’t have any ﬁne
dresses in a week or so, eh?”

10. The stranger then strode down the passage-way
again, and getting in a corner where he seemed to suppose
that he was out of sight, went through the strangest pan-

He is too honorable’ to be guilty of such’ an act.
A man may say, in general terms,

I am too busy’ , for projects‘.

But if he is urged to embark in some particular enterprise, he will
change the inﬂections, and say,

I am too busy‘ for projects’.

In such cases, as the falling inﬂection is required in the former part by
the principle of contrast and emphasis (as will hereafter be more fully

« explained), the sentence necessarily closes with the rising inﬂection.

shapes, and swinging himself back and forth in the limited
space.

3‘ ,-11. As the train was goinginto the depot, I placed my-

self on the platform of the car in front of the one in which
I had been riding, and opposite the stranger, who-, with a
portmanteau in each hand, was standing on the lowest step,
ready to jump to the ground. I looked from his face to
the faces of the people before us, but saw no sign of recog-
nition. Suddenly he cried, -“There they are!”

12. Then he laughed outright, but in a hysterical way,
as he looked over the crowd in front of him. I followed
his eye and ‘saw, some distance back, as if crowded out by
the well-dressed and elbowing throng, a little woman in a
faded dress and a well-worn hat, with a face almost painful
in its intense but hopeful expression, glancing rapidly
from window to window as the coaches passed by.

13. She had not seen the stranger, but a moment after
she caught his eye. In another instant he had jumped to
the platform with his two portmanteaus, and, pushing his
way through the crowd, he rushed towards the place where
she was standing, I think I never saw a face assume so
many different expressions in so short a time as did that
of the little woman while her husband was on his way to
meet her.

14. She was not pretty,——on the contrary, she was very
plain-looking; but somehow I felt a big lump rise in my
throat as I Watched her. She was trying to laugh, but,
God bless her, how completely she failed in the attempt!
Her mouth got into the position to laugh, but it never
moved after that, save to draw down at the corners and
quiver, while her eyes blinked so fast that I suspect she
only caught occasiohal glimpses of the broad-shouldered
fellow who elbowed his way so rapidly toward her.

15. As he drew close and dropped the portmanteaus,
she turned to one side and covered her face with her

hands; and thus she was when the strong man gathered
her up in his arms as if she were a child, and held her
sobbing to his breast.

16. There were enough staring at them, heaven knows;
so I turned my eyes away a moment, and then I saw two
boys in threadbare roundabouts standing near, wiping their
eyes on their sleeves, and bursting into tears anew at

every fresh demonstration on the part of their mother. _.
VVhen I looked at the stranger again he had his hat drawn

over his eyes; but his wife was looking up at him, and
it seemed as if the pent-up tears of those Weary months of
waiting were streaming through her eyelids.

LX. MAKE WAY FOR LIBERTY.

James Montgomery (b. 1771, d. 1854) was born in Irvine, Ayrshire,
Scotland. His father, a Moravian preacher, sent him to a Moravian
school at Fulneck, Yorkshire, England, to be educated. In 1794 he started
“The Sheffield Iris,” a Weekly paper, which he edited, with marked
ability, till 1825. He was ﬁned and imprisoned twice for publishing ar-
ticles decided to be seditious. His principal poetical Works are:“The
World before the Flood,” “Greenland,” “The West Indies,” “The Wan-
derer in Switzerland,” “The Pelican Island,” and “Original Hymns, for
Public, Private, and Social Devotion.” Mr. Montgomery’s style is gen-

‘ erally too diffuse; but its smoothness and the evident sincerity of his

emotions have made many of his hymns and minor poems very popular.
A pension of £300 a year was granted him in 1833. " "

All horrent with projected spears,
Whose polished points before them shine,
From ﬂank to ﬂank, one brilliant line,
Bright as the breakers’ splendors run
Along the billows to the sun.

‘Contending for their native land;

Peasants, Whose new-found strength had broke
From manly necks the ignoble yoke,

And forged their fetters into swords,’

On equal terms to ﬁght their lords;

A And what insurgent rage had gained,

In many a mortal fray maintained:
Marshaled once more at Freedom’s call,
They came to conquer or to fall,
Where he who conquered, he Who fell,
Was deemed a dead or living Tell!

5. And now the work of life and death

Hung on the passing of a breath;
The ﬁre of conﬂict burned within;

z The battle trembled to begin:

Yet, while the Austrians held their ground,
Point for attack was nowhere found;
Where’er the impatient Switzers gazed,

The unbroken line of lances blazed;

That line ’t were suicide to meet,

And perish at their tyrants’ feet;

How could they rest within their graves,
And leave their homes the homes of slaves?
Would they not feel their children tread
With clanking chains above their head?

. It must not be: this day, this hour,

Annihilates the oppressor’s power;

All Switzerland is in the ﬁeld,

She will not ﬂy, she can not yield;
Few were the numbers she could boast,
But every freeman was a host,

And felt as though himself were he
On whose sole armhung victory.

. It did depend on one, indeed:

Behold him! Arnold Winkelried!
There sounds not to the trump of fame
The echo of a nobler name.

Unmarked he stood amid the throng,
In rumination deep and long,

Till you might see with sudden grace,
The very thought come o’er his face;
And by the motion of his form,
Anticipate the bursting storm;

Then ran, with arms extended wide,
As if his dearest friend to clasp;
Ten spears he swept within his grasp:
“Make way for Liberty!” he cried,
Their keen points met from side to side;
He bowed among them like a tree,
And thus made way for Liberty.

9. Swift to the breach his comrades ﬂy;
“Make way for Liberty!” they cry,
And through the Austrian phalanx dart,
As rushed the spears through Arnold’s heart;
While instantaneous as his fall,
Rout, ruin, panic, scattered all.
An earthquake could not overthrow
A city with a surer blow.

10. Thus Switzerland again was free,
Thus Death made way for Liberty!

NoTEs.—The incident related in this poem is one of actual
occurrence, and took place at the battle of Sempach, fought in
1386 A. D., between only 1,300 Swiss and a large army of Aus-
trians. The latter had obtained possession of a narrow pass in
the mountains, from which it seemed impossible to dislodge them
until Arnold Struth VOI1 Winkelried made a breach in their line,
as narrated.

Rinaldo is a knight in Tasso’s “Jerusalem Delivered” (Canto

XVIII, 17—40),who enters an enchanted wood, and, by cutting‘

down a tree in spite of the nymphs and phantoms that en-
deavor in every way to stop him, breaks the spell; the Chris-
tian army are thus enabled to enter the grove and obtain timber
for their engines of war.

LXI. THE ENGLISH SKY-LARK.

Elihu Bur-ritt (b. 1810. d. 1879), “the learned blacksmith,” was born in
New Britain, Connecticut. His father was a shoemaker. Having received
only a limited amount of instruction at the district school, he was
apprenticed to a blacksmith about 1827. During his apprenticeship he
labored hard at self-instruction. He Worked at his trade many years,
from ten to twelve hours each day, but managed, in the meantime, to
acquire a knowledge of many ancient and modern languages. He
made translations from several of these, which were published in the
“American Eclectic Review.” In 1844 he commenced the publication
of “The Christian Citizen.” His leading literary works are: “Sparks
from the Anvil,” “A Voice from the Forge,” “ Peace Papers,” and “VValks
to John 0’ Groat’s House.” From the last of these the following selec-
tion is abridged. '

1. TAKE it in all, no bird in either hemisphere equals
the English lark in heart or voice, for both unite to
make it the sweetest, the happiest, the welcomest singer
that was ever winged, like the high angels of God’s love.
It is the living ecstasy of joy when it mounts up into its
“glorious privacy of light.”

2. On the earth it is timid, silent, and bashful, as if

not at home, and not sure of its right to be there at all.
(5.~13.) '

It is rather homely withal, having nothing in feather, feat-
ure, or form to attract notice. It is seemingly made to be
heard, not seen, reversing the old axiom addressed to chil-
dren when getting noisy.

3. Its mission is music, and it ﬂoods a thousand acres

of the blue sky with it several times a day. Out of that
palpitating speck of living joy there Wells forth a sea of
twittering ecstasy upon the morning and evening air. It
does not ascend by gyrations, like the eagle and birds of
prey. It mounts up like a human aspiration.
4. It seems to spread its Wings and to be lifted straight
upwards out of sight by the afflatus of its own happy heart.
To pour out this in undulating rivulets of rhapsody, is
apparently the only motive of its ascension. This it is
that has made it so loved of all generations.

5. It is the singing angel of man’s nearest heaven, Whose
vital breath is music. Its sweet Warbling is only the met-
rical palpitation of its life of joy. It goes up over the
roof-trees of the rural hamlet on the Wings of its song, as
if to train the human soul to trial ﬂights heavenward.

6. Never did the Creator put a voice of such volume
into so small a living thing. It is a marvel——-almost a
miracle. In a still hour you can hear it at nearly a mile’s
distance. VVhen its form is lost in the hazy lace-Work of
the sun’s rays above, it pours down upon you all the thrill-
ing semitones of its song as distinctly as if it were Warbling
to you in your Window.

LXII. HOW SLEEP THE BRAVE.

William Collins (b. 1720 d. 1756) was born at Chichester, England,
He was educated at Winchester and Oxford. About 1744, he Went to
London as a literary adventurer, and there Won the esteem of Dr.
Johnson. His “Odes” were published in 1746, but were not popular.
He was subsequently relieved from pecuniary embarrassment by a
legacy of £2,000 from a maternal uncle; but he soon became partially
insane, and was for some time conﬁned in an asylum for lunatics. He

afterwards retired to Chichester, Where he Was cared for by his sister «

until his death.

1. HOW sleep the brave who sink to rest
By all their country’s Wishes blessed!
When Spring, with dewy ﬁngers cold,
Returns to deck their hallowed mold;
She there shall dress a sweeter sod
Than Fancy’s feet have ever trod.

2. By fairy hands their knell is rung;

By forms unseen their dirge is sung;
There Honor comes a pilgrim gray,

To bless the turf that wraps their clay;
And Freedom shall awhile repair

To dwell a Weeping hermit there!

%I’LXIII. THE RAINBOW.

John Keble (b. 1792, d. 1866) was born near Fairfax, Gloucestershire,
England. He graduated at Oxford with "remarkably high honors, and
afterwards Was appointed to the professorship of Poetry in that uni-
versity. Since his death, Keble College, at Oxford, has been erected to
his memory. In 1835, he became vicar of Hursley and rector of Otter-
bourne, and held these livings until his death. His most famous Wor
is “The Christian Year,” a collection of sacred poems. '

Be there of heavenly day.

LXIV. SUPPOSED SPEECH OF JOHN ADAMS.

Daniel Webster ((2. 1782, (Z. 1852) was born in Salisbury, N, H. He
spent a few months of his boyhood at Phillips Academy, Exeter, but
ﬁtted for college under Rev. Samuel Wood, of Boscawen, N. H. He
graduated from Dartmouth College in 1801. He taught school several
terms, during and after his college course. _In 1805, he was admitted to
the bar in Boston, and practiced law in New Hampshire .for the suc-
ceeding eleven years. In 1812, he was elected to the United States
House of Representatives. In 1816, he removed to Boston, and in 1827
Was elected to the United States Senate, which position he held for
twelve years. In 1841, he was appointed Secretary of State. He returned
to the Senate in 1845. In 1850, he was re-appointed Secretary of State,
and continued in oﬂice until his death. He died at his residence, in
Marshﬁeld, Mass. Mr. Webster’s fame rests chieﬂy on his state papers
and speeches. As a speaker he was digniﬁed and stately, using clear,
pure English. During all his life he took great interest in agriculture,
and was Very fond of outdoor sports.

1. SINK or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give
my hand and my heart to this vote. It is true, indeed, that
in the beginning, we aimed not at independence. But,

“There ’s a divinity that shapes our ends.”

The injustice of England has driven us to arms; and,
blinded to her own interest, she has obstinately "persisted,
till independence is now Within our grasp. VVe have but
to reach forth to it, and it is ours. Why then should We

defer the declaration? Is any man so weak, as now to
hope for a reconciliation with England, which shall leave
either safety to the country and its liberties, or security to
his own life and his own honor! Are not you, sir, who
sit in that chair, is not he, our venerable colleague, near
you, are you not both already the proscribed and pre-
destined objects of punishment and of vengeance? Cut off

from all hope of royal clemency, what are you, what can

you be, while the power of England remains, but outlaws?
2. If we postpone independence, do we mean to carry on,
or to give up, the war? Do We mean to submit, and con-
sent that we shall be ground to powder, and our country
and its rights trodden down in the dust‘? I know we do
not mean to submit. VVe NEVER shall submit! Do we in-
tend to violate that most solemn obligation ever entered
into by men, that plighting, before God, of our sacred
honor to VVashington, when putting him forth to incur the
dangers of war, as well as the political hazards of the times,
we promised to adhere to him in every extremity with our
fortunes and our lives? I know there is not a man here,
who would not rather see a general conﬂagration sweep over
the land, or an earthquake sink it, than one jot or tittle
of that plighted faith fall to the ground. F or myself,
having twelve months ago, in this place, moved you, that
George VVashington be appointed commander of the forces
raised, or to be raised, for the defense of American liberty;
may my right hand forget her cunning, and my tongue
cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I hesitate or waver in

I ﬁre support I give him. 
3. The war, then, must go on. VVe must ﬁght it through. I

And if the war must go on, why put off the Declaration of
Independence? That measure will strengthen us. It will
give us character abroad. Nations will then treat with us,
which they never can do while we acknowledge ourselves
subjects in arms against our sovereign. Nay, I maintain
that England herself will sooner treat for peace with us

on the footing of independence, than consent, by repealing
her acts, to acknowledge that her whole conduct toward us
has been a course of injustice and oppression. Her pride
will be less wounded by submitting to that course of things,
which now predestinates our independence, than by yielding
the points in controversy to her rebellious subjects. The
former, she would regard as the result of fortune; the latter,
she would feel. as her own deep disgrace. VVhy, then, do
we not change this from a‘ civil to a national. war? And
since we must ﬁght it through, why not put ourselves in
a state to enjoy all the beneﬁts of victory, if we gain the
victory.

4. If we fail, it can be no worse for us. But we shall
not fail. The cause will raise up armies; the cause will
create navies. The people——the people, if we are true to
them, will carry us, and will carry themselves, gloriously
through this struggle. I care not how ﬁckle other people
have been found. I know the people of these colonies;
and I know that resistance to British aggression is deep
and settled in their hearts, and can not be eradicated.
Sir, the Declaration of Ind.ependence will inspire the peo-
ple with increased courage. Instead of a long and bloody
war for the restoration of privileges, for redress of griev-
ances, for chartered immunities, held under a British king,
set before them. the glorious object of entire independence,
and it will breathe into them anew the spirit of life.

5. Read this declaration at the head of the army; every
sword will be drawn, and the solemn vow uttered to main-
tainoiit or perish on the bed of honor.‘ Publish it from
the pulpit; religion will approve it, and the love of re-
ligious liberty will cling around it, resolved to stand with
it or fall with it. Send it to the public halls; proclaim it
there; let them see it, who saw their br<)tli‘ers and their
sons fall on the ﬁeld of Bunker Hill, and l\l°l\_°l3L:Xl:18 streets of
Lexington and Concord, and the very walls will cry out in
its support.

6. Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs, but I
see—I see clearly through this day’s business. You and I,
indeed, may rue it. We may not live to see the time this
declaration shall be made good. We may die; die colo-
nists; die slaves; die, it may be, ignominiously, and on
the scaffold. Be it so: be’ it so. If it be the pleasure of
Heaven that my country shall require the poor offering of

my life, the victim shall be ready at the appointed hour of ,

sacriﬁce, come when that hour may. But while I do live,
let me have a country, or at least the hope of a country,
and that a FREE country.

7. But whatever may be our fate, be assured——be as-
sured that this declaration will stand. It may cost treas-
ure, and it may cost blood; but it will stand, and it will
richly compensate for botl1. Through the thick gloom of
the present I see the brightness of the future as the sun in
heaven. VVe shall make this a glorious, an immortal day.
When we are in our graves, our children will honor it.
They will celebrate it with thanksgiving, with festivity,
with bonﬁres, and illuminations. On its annual return
they will shed tears,—-copious, gushing tears; not of sub-
jection and slavery, notof agony and distress, but of ex-
ultation, of gratitude, and of joy. ~

8. Sir, before God, I believe the hour is come.  My
judgment approves the measure, and my whole heart is in
it. All that I have, and all that I am, and all that I
hope in this life, I‘ am now ready here to stake upon it;
and I leave off’ as I began, that, live or die, survive or

perish, I am for the declaration. It is my living senti- ,

ment, and, by the blessing of God, it shall be my dying
sentiment; independence now, and INDEPENDENCE FOR-
EVER. -

LXV. THE RISING.

Thomas Buchanan Read (b. 1822, d. 1872) was born in Chester County,
Pennsylvania. In 1839 he entered a sculptor’s studio in Cincinnati,
where he gained reputation as a portrait painter. He afterwards went to
New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, and, in 1850, to Italy. He divided
his time between Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and Rome, in the later years
of his life. Some of his poems are marked by vigor and strength,wl1ile
others are distinguished by smoothness and delicacy. The following se-
lection is abridged from “The Wagoner of the A1leghanies.”

1. OUT of the North the wild news came,
Far ﬂashing on its wings of ﬂame,
Swift as the boreal light which ﬂies
At midnight through the startled skies.

The ﬁfe’s shrill note, the drum’s loud beat, ,
And through the wide land every-where
The answering tread of hurrying feet,

Came on the blast from Lexington.

Forgot her old baptismal name,

Made bare her patriot arm of power,

And swelled the discord of the hour.

. The yeoman and the yeoman’s son,

With knitted brows and sturdy dint,
Renewed the polish of each gun,

Re-oiled the lock, reset the ﬂint;
And oft the maid and matron there,
While kneeling in. the ﬁrelight glare,
Long poured, with half-suspended breath,
The lead into the molds of death.

. The hands by Heaven made silken soft

To soothe the brow of love or pain,
Alas! are dulled and soiled too oft

By some unhallowed earthly stain;
But under the celestial bound
No nobler picture can be found
Than woman, brave in Word and deed,
Thus serving in her nation’s need:
Her love is with her country now,
Her hand is on its aching brow.

. Within its shade of elm and oak

The church of Berkley Manor stood:
There Sunday found the rural folk,
,And some esteemed of gentle blood.
In vain their feet with loitering tread
Passed ’mid the graves where rank is naught:
All could not read the lesson taught
In‘ that republic of the dead.

Of sacred rights to be secured;
Then from his patriot tongue of ﬂame
The startling words for Freedom came.
The stirring sentences he spake

And, lo! he met their wondering eyes
Complete in all a warrior’s guise.

When Berkley cried, “ Cease, traitor! cease!

There is a time to ﬁght and pray!”

every man in the congregation enlisted under him at the church
door. Muhlenberg became a well known general in the Revolu-
tion, and after the war served his country in Congress and in
various official positions.

LXVI. CONTROL YOUR TEMPER.

John Todd, D. D. (b. 1800, d. 1873), was born in Rutland, Vt. In 1842,
he was settled as a pastor of a Congregational Church, in Pittsﬁeld,
Mass. - In 1834, he published “Lectures to Children;” in 1835, “The
Student’s Manual,” a valuable and popular work, which has been trans-
lated into several European languages; in 1836, “The Sabbath-School
Teacher; ” and in 1841, “The Lost Sister of Wyoming.” He was one of
the founders of the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary.

1. No ONE has a temper naturally so good, that it does
not need attention and cultivation, and no one has a tem-
per so ‘ bad, but that, by proper culture, it may become
pleasant. One of the best disciplined tempers ever seen,
was that of a gentlemen who was naturally quick, irritable,
rash, and violent; but, by having the care of the sick, and
especially of deranged people, he so completely mastered
himself that he was never known to be thrown off his
guard.

2. The difference in the happiness which is received or
bestowed by the man who governs his temper, and that by
the man who does not, is immense. There is no misery so
constant, so distressing, and so intolerable to others, as that
of having a disposition which is your master, and which
is continually fretting itself. There are corners enough, at
every turn in life, against which we may run, and at which
we may break out in impatience, if we choose.

3. Look at Roger Sherman, who rose from a humble
occupation to a seat in the ﬁrst Congress of the United
States, and Whose judgment was received with great defer-

FIFTH READER. 205

ence by that body of distinguished men. He made himself
master of his temper, and cultivated it as a great business
in life. There are o11e or two instances which show this
part of his character in a light that is beautiful.

4. One day, after having received his highest honors,
he was sitting and reading in his parlor. A roguish
student, in a room close by, held a looking-glass in such

a position as to pour the reﬂected rays of the sun directly i

in Mr. Sherman’s face. He moved his chair, and the
thing was repeated.  third time the chair was moved,
but the looking-glass still reﬂected the sun in his eyes.
He laid aside his book, went to the window, and many
witnesses of the impudence expected to hear the ungentle-
manly student severely reprimanded. He raised’the win-
dow gently, and then—shut the window-blind!

. I can not forbear adducing another instance of the
power he had acquired over himself. He was naturally
possessed of strong passions; but over these he at length
obtained an extraordinary control. He became habitually

-. calm, sedate, and self—possessed. Mr. Sherman was one of
those men who are not ashamed to maintain the forms of
religion in their families. One morning he called them
all together, as usual, to lead them in prayer to God; the
“old family Bible” was brought out, and laid on the table.

6. Mr. Sherman took his seat, and placed beside him
one of his children, a child of his old age; the rest of the
family were seated around the room; several of these were

, now grown up. Beside these, some of the tutors of the

college were boarders in the family, and were present at
the time alluded to. His aged and superannuated mother
occupied a corner of the room, opposite the place where
the distinguished judge sat.

7. At length, he opened the Bible, and began to read.
The child who was seated beside him made some little dis-

‘ turbance, upon which Mr. Sherman paused and told it to

be still. Again he proceeded; but again he paused to

reprimand the little offender, whose playful disposition
would scarcely permit it to be still. And this time he
gently tapped its ear._ The blow, if blow it might be
called, caught the attention of his aged mother, who now,
with some effort, rose from the seat, and tottered across
the room. At length she reached the chair of Mr. Sher-

; man, and, in a moment, most unexpectedly to him, she

gave him a blow on the ear with all the force she could
summon. “There,” said she, “you strike your child, and
I will strike mine.”

8. For a moment, the blood was seen mounting to the
face of Mr. Sherman; but it was only for a moment, when
all was calm and mild as usual. ,He paused; he raised
his spectacles; he cast his eye upon his mother; again it
fell upon the book from which he had been reading. Not
a word escaped him; but again he calmly pursued the
service, and soon after sought in prayer an ability to set
an example before his household which would be worthy
of their imitation. Such a victory was worth more than
the proudest one ever achieved on the ﬁeld of battle.

soon afterward appointed surveyor of lands for the county. In
1754, he was admitted to the bar. At various times he was
elected a judge; sent to the Legislature, to the Colonial Assembly,
and to the United States Congress; made a member of the gov-
ernor’s council of safety; and, in 1776, a member of the com-
mittee appointed to draft the Declaration of Independence, of

LXVII. WILLIAM TELL.

James Sheridan Knowles (b. 1784, d. 1862), a dramatist and actor, Was
born in Cork, Ireland. In 1792 his father removed to London With his
family. At the age of fourteen, Sheridan wrote an opera called “The
Chevalier de Grillon.” In 1798 he removed to Dublin, and soon after be-
gan his career as an actor and author. In 1835 he visited America. In
1839 an annual pension of £200 was granted him by the British govern-
ment. Several years before his death he left the stage and became a Bap-
tist minister. The best known of his plays are “ Oaius Gracchus,” “ Vir-
ginius,” “Leo, the Gypsy,” “The Hunchback,” and “ William Tell,” from
the last of which the following two lessons are abridged.

SCENE 1.—A Chamber in the Castle. Enter Gesler, Oﬁicers,
and Sarnem, with Tell in chains and guarded.

Sar. DOWN, slave! Behold the governor;
Down! down! and beg for mercy.

Ges. (Seatecl) Does he hear ?’

Sar. He does, but braves thy power.

Oﬁicer. Why don’t you smite him for that look?

Ges. Can I believe
My eyes? He smiles! Nay, grasps
His chains as he would make a Weapon of them
To lay the smiter dead. (Lib Tell.)

. Why speakest thou not?

Tell. For Wonder.

Ges. Wonder? ,

Tell. Yes, that thou shouldst seem a man.

Ges. What should I seem?

Tell. A monster.

Ges. Ha! Beware! Think on thy chains,

Tell. Though they were doubled, and did Weigh me down
Prostrate to the earth, methinks I could rise up
Erect, with nothing but the honest pride
Of telling thee, usurper, to thy teeth,

Thou art a monster! Think upon my chains?
How came they on me?

FIFTH READER. 19

I conjure you by that which you profess,

(Howe’er you came to know it,) answer me;

Though you untie the winds and let them ﬁght
Against the churches’; though the yeasty waves
Confound and swallow navigation’ up;

Though bladed corn be lodged, and trees blown down’ :
Though castles topple on their warders’ heads’;
Though palaces and pyramids do slope

Their heads to their foundations’; though the treasures
Of nature’s germens tumble altogether’,

Even till destruction sicken’ ; answer me

To what I ask‘ you.

§4. A series of words or members which concludes a
sentence is called a concluding series, and each member usu-
ally has the falling inﬂection.

EXAMPLE OF CONCLUDING SERIES.

ness‘, obtained promises‘, stopped the mouths of lions‘, quenched

REMARK.—When the emphasis on these words or mem-
bers is not marked, they take the rising inflection, accord-

ing to Rule IX. ’

May cha11ce to cross thee; if he should, I pray thee
Relate to him what has been passing here,

The cliff‘ where he was bred, and learned to scan

Where he was trained to hear the thunder talk,
And meet the lightning, eye to eye; where last
We spoke together, when I told him death
Bestowed the brightest gem that graces life,
Embraced for Virtue’s sake. He shed a tear!
Now were he by, I’d talk to him, and his cheek
Should never blanch, nor moisture dim his eye-

NOTE.-— William Tell is a legendary hero of Switzerland. The I

events of this drama are represented as occurring in 1307 A. D.,
when Austria held Switzerland under her control. Gesler, also
a purely mythical personage, is one of the Austrian bailiifs.
The legend relates that Gesler had his cap placed on a pole in
the market-place, and all the Swiss were required to salute it in
passing in recognition of his authority. Tell refusing to do
this was arrested, and condemned to death. This and the follow-
ing lesson narrate how the sentence was changed, and the result.

Exception to the Rule.——Whi1e the tendency of emphasis is decidedly to
the use of the falling inﬂection, sometimes a word to which the falling in-
ﬂection naturally belongs, changes this, when it is emphatic, for the ris-
ing inﬂection. ' ,

EXAMPLES.

I Three thousand ducats‘: ’t is a good round smn’.
It is useless to point out the beauties of nature to one who is
blind’.

Here sum and blind, according to Rule VI, would take the fa1ling‘inﬂec-
tion, but as they are emphatic, and the object of emphasis is to draw
attention to the word emphasized, this is here accomplished in part by
giving an unusual inﬂection. Some speakers would give these Words the
circumﬂex, but it would be the m’sz'ng circumﬂex, so that the sound
would still terminate with the rising inﬂection.

RULE VIII.-——Questions which can not be answered by
yes or no, together with their answers, generally require
the falling inﬂection.

EXAMPLES.
Where has he gone‘? Ans. To New York‘.
What has he done‘? Ans. Nothing‘.
Who did this‘? Ans. I know not‘.
When did he go‘? Ans. Yesterday‘.

REMARK.—If these questions are repeated, the inﬂection is changed ac- V

cording to the principle stated under the Exception to Rule VII.

Where did you say he had gone’?
What has he done’?

Who did this’ ?

When did he go’ ?

RISING INFLECTION.

RULE IX.—Where a pause is rendered proper by the
meaning, and the sense is incomplete, the rising inﬂection
is generally required.

Tell leaped ashore and escaped: then going to a point where he
knew the boat must land, he lay concealed until it arrived,

LXIX. THE CRAZY ENGINEER.

1. MY TRAIN left Dantzic in the morning generally about
eight o’clock; but once a week we had to wait for the arrival
of the steamer from Stockholm. It was the morning of the
steamer’s arrival that I came down from the hotel, and found

that my engineer had been so seriously injured that he could.

not perform his work. I went immediately to the engine-
house to procure another engineer, for I supposed there were
three or four in reserve there, but I was disappointed.

2. I heard the puﬂing of the steamer, and the passengers
would be on hand in ﬁfteen minutes. I ran to the guards
and asked them if they knew where there was an engineer,
but they did not. I then went to the ﬁremen and asked
them if any one of them felt competent to run the engine to
Bromberg. No one dared to attempt it. The distance was
nearly one hundred miles. What was to be done?

3. The steamer stopped at the wharf, and those who were
going on by rail came ﬂocking to the station. They had

eaten breakfast on board the boat, and were all ready for a ‘
‘ fresh start. The train was in readiness in the long station-

house, and the engine was steaming and puﬁing away impa-
tiently in the distant ﬁring-house.

4. It was past nine o’clock. “ Come, why don’t We
start?” growled an old, fat Swede, who had been watching
me narrowly for the last ﬁfteen minutes.‘ And upon this
there was a general chorus of anxious inquiry, which soon
settled to downright murmuring. At this juncture some
one touched me on the elbow. I turned,and saw a stranger
by my side. I thought that he was going to remonstrate
with me for my backwardness. In fact, I began to have
strong temptations to pull off my uniform, for every anxious
eye was ﬁxed upon the glaring badges which marked me as
the chief ofﬁcer of the tra.in. r

5. However, this stranger was a middle-aged man, tall

and stout, with a face of great energy and intelligence. His
eye was black and brilliant,——so brilliant that I could not
gaze steadily into it, though I tried; and his lips, which
were very thin, seemed more like polished marble than
human ﬂesh. His dress was black throughout, and not only
set with exact nicety, but was scrupulously clean a11d neat.

6. “ You want an engineer, I understand,” he said in a
low, cautious tone, at the same time gazing quietly about
him, as though he wanted no one to hear what he said.

“ I do,” I replied. “My train is all ready, and we have
no engineer within twenty miles of this place.”

“Well, sir, I am going to Bromberg; I must go, and I
will run the engine for you.”

“ Ha!” I uttered, “ are you an engineer?”

“I am, sir——one of the oldest in the country——and am
now on my way to make arrangements for a great im-
provement I have invented for the application of steam to
a locomotive. My name is Martin Kroller. If you wish,
I will run as far as Bromberg; and I will show you running

97. Was I not fortunate? I determined to accept the
man’s offer at once, and so I told him. He received my
answer with a nod and a smile. I went with him to the
house,where we found the engine in charge of the ﬁreman,
and all ready for a start. Kroller got upon the platform,
and I followed him. I had never seen a man betray such
a peculiar aptness amid machinery as he did. He let on

the steam in an instant, but yet with care and judgment, ,

and he backed up to the baggage-carriage with the most
exact nicety.
,  8. I had seen enough to assure me that he was thoroughly

gaécquainted with the business, and I felt composed once more.
I gave my engine up to the new man, and then hastened
away to the oﬁice. Word was passed for all the passengers
to take their seats, and soon afterward I waved my hand
to the engineer. There was a puff, a groaning of the
heavy axle-trees, a trembling of the building, and the train
was in motion. I leaped upon the platform of the guard-
carriage, and in a few minutes more the station-house was
far behind us.

9. In less than an hour we reached‘ Dirschau, where we
took up the passengers that had come on the Konigsberg
railway. Here I went forward and asked Kroller how he
liked the engine. He replied that he liked it very much.

“ But,” he added, with a strange sparkling of the eye,
“wait until I get my improvement, and then you will see
traveling. Why, I could run an engine of my construction
to the moon in four-and-twenty hours!”

10. I smiled at what I thought his enthusiasm, and then
went back to my station. As soon as the Konigsberg
passengers were all on board, and their baggage-carriage
attached, we started on again. Soon after, I went into the
guard-carriage and sat down. An early train from Ko'nigs-
berg had been through two hours before, and, was await-
ing us at Little Oscue, where we took on board the West-
ern mail.

11. “How we go,” uttered one of the guards, some ﬁfteen
minutes after we had left Dirschau.

“The new engineer is trying the speed,” I replied, not yet
having any fear. But ere long I began to apprehend he
was running a little too fast.” -The carriages began to sway
to and fro, and «could? hear exclamations of fright from
the passenge?;Ii’S?;Af“:.,  ;  I

“ Good*..h.e?a'vens'a! ” cried one of the guard, coming in at
that moment, “ what is that fellow doing? Look, sir, and
see how we are going.” i

12. I looked at the window, and found that we were
dashing along at a speed never before traveled on that
road. Posts, fences, rocks, and trees ﬂew by in one undis-
tinguished mass, and the carriages now swayed fearfully.
I started to my feet, and met a passenger on the platform.
He was one of the chief owners of our road, and was just
on his way to, Berlin. He was pale and excited.

it  “Sir,” he gasped, “is Martin Kroller on the engine?”

“Yes,” I told him.

“,Whatl did n’t you know him?”

“Know?” I repeated, somewhat puzzled; “ what do you
mean?’ He told me his name was Kroller, and that he was
an engineer. We had no one to run the engine, and—”

“You took him!” interrupted the man. “ Good heavens,
sir, he is as crazy as a man can be! He turned his brain
over a new plan for applying steam-power. I saw him at
the station, but did not fully recognize him, as I was in a

hurry. Just now one of your passengers told me that your ~

engineers were all gone this morning, and that you found
one that was a stranger to you. Then I knew the man
whom I had seen was Martin Kroller. He had escaped from
the hospital at Stettin. You must get him oﬁ” somehow.”
14. The whole fearful truth was now open to me. The
speed of the train was increasing every moment, and I
knew that a few more miles perwéhoilr would launch us all
into destruction. I called to the gitard, and then made my

FIFTH READER. 225

way forward as quickly as possible. I reached the back
platform of the tender, and there stood Kroller upon the
engine-board, his hat and coat off, his long black hair ﬂoat-
ing wildly in the wind, his shirt unbuttoned at the front, his
sleeves rolled up, with a pistol in his teeth, and thus glaring
upon the ﬁreman, who lay motionless upon the fuel. The
furnace was stuffed till the very latch of the door was red-

hot, and the whole engine was quivering and swaying as y

tlLo_1_1_gh it would shiver to pieces.

15. “ Kroller! Kroller!” I cried, at the top of my voice.

The crazy engineer started, and caught the pistol in his
hand. Oh, how those great black eyes glared, and how
ghastly and frightful the face looked!

“ Ha! ha! ha!” he yelled demoniacally, glaring upon
me like a roused lion.

“They said that I could not make it! But see! see!
See my new power! See my new engine! I made it, and
they are jealous of me! I made it, and when it was done,
they stole it from me. But I have found it! For years
I have been wandering in search of my great engine, and
they said it was not made. But I have found it! I knew
it this morning when I saw it at Dantzic, and I was deter-
mined to have it. And I’ve got it! Ho! ho! ho! we ’re
on the way to the moon, I say! We ’ll be in the moon in
four-and-twenty hours. Down, down, villain! If you move,
I ’ll shoot you.”

This was spoken to the poor ﬁreman, who at that moment

attempted to rise, and the frightened man sank back again-
' .5. 16. “ Here ’s Little Oscue just before us,” cried out one

4-'.~t1»+.l=-e guard. But even as he spoke, the buildings were at
hand. A sickening sensation settled upon my heart, for I
supposed that we were now gone. The houses ﬂew by like
lightning. I knew if the officers here had turned the switch
as usual, we should be hurled into eternity in one fearful

~ crash. I saw a ﬂash,—it was another engine,——I closed my

eyes; but still we thundered on! The ofﬁcers had seen our

223 ECLEOTIC’ SERIES.

speed, and knowing that we would not be able to stop, in
that distance, they had changed the switch, so that we
went forward.

17. But there was sure death ahead, if we did not stop.
Only ﬁfteen miles from us was the town of Schwetz, on
the Vistula; and at the rate we were going we should be
there in a few minutes, for each minute carried us over
a mile. The shrieks of the passengers now rose above the
crash of the rails, and more terriﬁc than all else arose the
demoniac yells of the mad engineer.

“Merciful heavens!” gasped the guardsman, “ there ’s
not a moment to lose; Schwetz is close. But hold,” he added;
“let.’s shoot him.” V

18. At that moment a tall, stout German student came
over the platform where we stood, and we saw that the
madman had his heavy pistol aimed at us. He grasped a
huge stick of wood, and, with a steadiness of nerve which
I could not have commanded, he hurled it with such force
and precision that he knocked the pistol from the maniac’s
hand. I saw the movement, and on the instant that the
pistol fell, I sprang forward, and the German followed me.
I grasped the man by the arm; but I should have been
nothing in his mad power, had I been alone. He would
have hurled me from the platform, had not the student at
that moment struck him upon the head with a stick of
wood, which he caught as he came over the tender.

19. Kroller settled down like a dead man, and on the
next instant I shut off’ the steam and opened the valve.
As the free steam shrieked and howled in its escape, the
speed began to decrease, and in a few minutes more the
danger was passed. As I settled back, entirely overcome
by the wild emotions that had raged within me, we began
to turn the river; and before I was fairly recovered, the
ﬁreman had stopped the train in the station-house at
Schwetz.

20. Martin Kroller, still insensible, was taken from the



tr‘ FIFTH READER. 227

platform; and, as we carried him to the guard-room, one
of the guard recognized him, and told us that he had been
there about two weeks before.

“He came,” said the guard, “and swore that an engine
which stood near by was his. He said it was one he had
made to go to the moon in, and that it had been stolen from
him. We sent for more help to arrest him, and he ﬂed.”

“Well,” I replied, with a shudder, “I wish he had ap- ,

preached me in the same way; but he was more cautious
at Dantzic.”

At Schwartz we found an engineer to run the engine to
Bromberg; and having taken out the VVestern mail for the
next Northern mail to carry along, We saw that Kroller
would be properly attended to, and then started on.

21. The rest of the trip we ran in safety, though I could
see the passengers were not wholly at ease, and would not
be until they were entirely clear of the railway. Martin
Kroller remained insensible from the effects of the blow
nearly two Weeks; and when he recovered from that, he
was sound again; his insanity was all gone. I saw him
about three weeks afterward, but he had no recollection of
me. He remembered nothing of the past year, not even
his mad freak on my engine. But I remembered it, and I
remember it still; and the people need never fear that I
shall be imposed upon again by a crazy engineer.

LXX. THE HERITAGE.

James Russell Lowell (b. 1819,  was born in Cambridge, Mass.,
and is a graduate of Harvard College. He entered the profession of law;
but, in 1843, turned aside to publish “The Pioneer, a Literary and Crit-
ical Magazine,” which proved, however, a ﬁnancial failure. In 1855 he
was appointed professor of Belles-lettres in Harvard College; and in
1877 was made U. S. Minister to Spain. Lowe1l’s powers as a writer are
very versatile, and his poems range from the most dreamy and imagi-
native to the most trenchant and witty. Among his most noted poetical
Works are “ The Biglow Papers,” “ The Fable for Critics,” “ The Vision of
Sir Launfa1,” “The Cathedral,” and “The Legend of Brittany;” while
“Conversations on some of the Old Poets,” “Among my Books,” and
“ My Study Windows,” place him in the front rank as an essayist.

LXXIII. THE EXAMINATION.

Daniel Pierce Thompson (b. 1795, d. 1868) was born at Charlestown,
Massachusetts, but soon removed with his father to Vermont, Where he
lived until twenty years of age, on a farm. His means of schooling were
most limited, but he was Very ambitious and seized every opportunity.
By his own efforts he earned enough money to carry him through Mid-
dlebury College, Where he graduated in 1820. He then went to Virginia
as private tutor, and While there was entered at the bar. He shortly re-
turned to Vermont, and opened a law oﬂice in Montpelier. In time he
Was elected a Judge, and later Secretary of State. From His college days
Mr. Thompson was a Writer for the various magazines. Among his nov-
els may be mentioned “ Locke Amsden, the Schoolmaster,” “ May Martin,
or the Money Diggers,” “The Green Mountain Boys,” and “ The Rangers,
or the Tory’s Daughter.”

1. “ HAVE you any questions to ask me in the other
branches, sir?” asked Locke.

“Not many,” replied Bunker. “There is reading, writ-
ing, grammar, etc., which I know nothing about; and as
to them, I must, of course, takeyou by guess, which will
not be much of a guess, after all, if —, I ﬁnd you have
thought well. on all other matters. Do you understand
philosophy ? ”

2. “ To what branch of philosophy do you allude, sir?”

“To the only branch there is.”

“ But you are aware that philosophy is divided into dif-
ferent kinds; as, natural, moral, and intellectual.”

“Nonsense? philosophy is philosophy, and means the
study of the reasons and causes of the things which we
see, whether it be applied to a crazy man’s dreams, or the
roasting of potatoes. Have you attended to it?”

“Yes, to a considerable extent, sir.”.

3. “I will put a question or two, then, if you please.
What is the reason of the fact, for it is a fact, that the
damp breath of a person blown on a good knife, and on a

bad one, will soonest disappear from the well-tempered
blade? ”. y

FIFTH READER.   235.

“ It may be owing to the difference in the polish of the
two blades, perhaps,” replied Locke.

4. “Ah! that is an answer that don’t go deeper than
the surface,” rejoined Bunker, humorously. “As good a
thinker as you evidently are, you have not thought on
this subject, I suspect. It took me a week, .in.all, I pre-

sume, of hard thinking, and making experiments at a
blacksmith’s shop, to discover the reason of this. Itis not i

the polish: for take two blades of equal polish, and the
breath will disappear from one as much quicker than it
does from the other, as the blade is better. It is because
the material of the blade is more compact. or less porous
in one "case than in the other.

5. “ In the ﬁrst place, I ascertained that the steel was
made more compact by being hammered and tempered,
and that the better it was tempered the more compact it
would become; the size of the pores being made, of course,
less in the__ same proportion. Well_, then, I saw the reason
I was in search of, at once. For we know a wet sponge is
longer in drying than a wet piece of green, wood, because
the pores of the ﬁrst are bigger. Aseasoned or shrunk
piece of wood dries quicker than a green one, for the same
reason. I

6. , “Or you might bore a piece of wood with large
gimlet-holes, and another with small ones, ﬁll them both
with water, and let them stand till the water evaporated,
and the difference’ of time it would take to do this would
make the case still more plain. So with the blades: the
vapor lingers longest on the worst wrought and tempered
one, because the pores, being larger, take in more of _ the
wet particles, and require more time in drying.”

,p 7. “ Your theory is at least a very ingenious one,” ob-
served Locke, “ and I am reminded by it of anotherof
the natural phenomena, of the true explanation of which I
have not been able to satisfy myself. It is this -: what
makes the earth freeze harder and deeper under a trodden

236 ECLEOTI SERIES.

path than the untrodden earth around it? All that I have
asked, say it is because the trodden earth is more compact.
But is that reason a sufﬁcient one?”

8. “No,” said Bunker, “but I will tell you what the
reason is, for I thought that out long ago. You know
that, in the freezing months, much of the warmth we get
is given out by the earth, from which, at intervals, if not
constantly, to some extent, ascend the warm vapors to
mingle with and moderate the cold atmosphere above.

9. “ Now these ascending streams of warm air would be

almost wholly obstructed by the compactness of a trodden
path, and they would naturally divide at some distance
below it, and pass up through the loose earth on each
side, leaving the ground along the line of the path, to a
great depth beneath it, a cold, dead mass, through which
the frost would continue to penetrate, unchecked by the
internal heat, which, in its unobstructed ascent on each
side, would be continually checking or overcoming the frost
in its action on the earth around.
‘* 10. “That, sir, is the true philosophy of the case, you

of these matters; for I am abundantly satisﬁed that you
have not only knowledge enough, but that you can think
for yourself. And now, sir, all I wish to know further
about you is, whether you can teach others to think, which
is half the battle with a ‘teacher. But as I have had an
eye on this point, while attending to the others, probably
one experiment, which I will ask you to make on one of
the boys here, will be all I shall want.”

“ Proceed, sir,” said the other.

11. “ Ay, sir,” rejoined Bunker, turning to the open ﬁre-
place, in which the burning wood was sending up a ‘column
of smoke: “There, you see that smoke rising, don’t you?
Well, you and I know the reason why smoke goes upward,
but my youngest boy does not, I think. Now take your
own way, and see if you can make‘ him understand it.”

12. Locke, after? a moment’s reﬂection, and a glance
round the room for something - to serve for apparatus, took
from a shelf, where he had espied a number of articles,
the smallest of a set of cast-iron cart-boxes, as are usually
termed the round hollow tubes in which the axle-tree of a
carriage turns. Then selecting a tin cup that would just
take in the box, and turning into the cup as much water

as be judged, with the box, would ﬁll it, he presented,

them separately to the boy, and said,

“There, my lad, tell me which of these is the heavier?”

13. “ Why, the cart-box, to be sure,” replied the boy,
taking the cup, half-ﬁlled with water, in one hand, and the
hollow iron in the other. ,

“Then you think this iron is heavier than as much
water as would ﬁll the place of it, do you?” resumed
Locke.

“ Why, yes, as heavy again, and more too——I know it
is,” promptly said the boy.

14. “Well, sir, now mark what I do,” proceeded the
fbrmer, dropping into the cup the iron box, through the
hollow of which the water instantly rose to the brim of the
vessel.

“ There, you saw that water rise to the top of the cup,
did you?”

“Yes, I did.”

“Very well, what caused it to do so?”

15. “Why, I know well enough, if I could only think:
why,‘ it is because the iron is the heavier, and as it comes
all around the water so it can’t get away sideways, it is
forced up.”

“That is right; and now I want you to tell what makes
that smoke rise up the chimney.”

 16. “Why,—I guess,” replied the boy, hesitating, “I

guess,——I guess I do n’t know.”
“Did you ever get up in a chair to look on some high
shelf, so that your head was brought near the ceiling of a

17 “Yes, I remember I have, and found the air up ~

there as warm as mustard; and when I got‘ down, and
bent my head near the floor to pick up something, I found
it as cold as could be.”

“That is ever the case; but I wish you to tell me how
the cold air always happens to settle down to the lower
part of the room, while the warm air, somehow, at the
same‘ time, gets above.” .

18. "Why, why, heavy things settle down, and thecold

and so settles down, and crowds up the warm air.”

" “ Very good. You then understand that cold air is

heavier than the heated air, as that iron is heavier than ’

the water ; so now we will go back to the main question-
what makes the smoke go upwards?”

19. “Oh! I see now as plain as day; the cold air settles
down all round, like the iron box, and drives up the hot
air as fast as the ﬁre beats it, in the middle, like the
water ; and so the hot air carries the smoke along up with
it, just as feathers and things in a whirlwind. Well! I
have found out what makes smoke go up——isn’t it curious?”

LXXIV. THE ISLE OF LONG AGO.

Benjamin Franklin Taylor (b. 1822, d. 1887) was born at Lowville
N. Y. He graduated at Madison University, of which his father was
president. In 1845 he published “Attractions of Language.” For many
years he was literary editor of the “ Chicago Journal.” Mr. Taylor wrote
considerably for the magazines, was the author of many well known
favorite pieces both in prose and verse, and achieved success as a
lecturer.

1. OH, a wonderful stream is the river of Time,
As it runs through the realm of tears,
With a faultless rhythm and a musical rhyme,
And a boundless sweep and a surge sublime,
As it blends with the ocean of Years.

2. How the winters are drifting, like ﬂakes of snow,
And the summers, like buds between;
And the year in the sheaf-——so they come and they go
On the river’s breast, with its ebb and ﬂow,
As it glides in the shadow and sheen.

And we bury our treasures there;

There are brows of beauty and bosoms of snow-

There are heaps of dust—but we love them so!--
There are trinkets and tresses of hair;

There are fragments of song that nobody sings,

And a part of an infant’s prayer, .
There’s a lute unswept, and a harp without strings;
There are broken vows and pieces of rings,

And the garments that she used towear.

There are hands that are waved, when the fairy shore
By the mirage is lifted in air;

And we sometimes hear, through the turbulent roar,

Sweet voices we heard in the days gone before,
When the wind down the river is fair.

Oh, remembered for aye be the blessed Isle,
All the day of our life till night-
When the evening comes with its beautiful smile,
And our eyes are closing to slumber awhile,
May that “Greenwood” of Soul be in sight!

LXXV.  BOSTON MASSACRE.

,; .‘

 

George Bancroft (b. 1800: ) was born at Worcester, Massachusetts.
He Was an ambitious student, and graduated at Harvard College before
he was eighteen years of age. He then traveled in Europe, spending
some time at the German universities. On his return, in 1822, he was ap-
pointed tutor in Greek at Harvard. His writings at this time were a
small volume of original poems, some translations from Schiller and
Goethe, and a few striking essays. Mr. Bancroft has held numerous high
political offices. In 1838 he was appointed collector of the port at Boston;

in 1845 he Was made Secretary of the Navy; in 1849 he was sent as United ‘

States Minister to Great Britain; and in 1867 he was sent in the same ca-
pacity to Prussia. The Work which has given Mr. Bancroft his great liter-
ary reputation is his “History of the United States,‘ from the Discovery
of the American Continent.” The ﬁrst volume appeared in 1834. Phil-
osophical in reasoning, interesting, terse in style, and founded on careful
research, under the most favorable advantages, the Work stands alone
in its sphere.

1. THE evening of the ﬁfth came on. The young moon
was shining brightly in a cloudless winter sky, and its light
was increased by a new-fallen snow.» Parties of soldiers
were driving about the streets, making a parade of valor,
challenging resistance, and striking the inhabitants indis-
criminately with sticks or sheathed cutlasses. —

2. A band, which poured out from Murray’s barracks,
in Brattle Street, armed with clubs, cutlasses, and bayo-
nets, provoked resistance, and a. fray ensued. Ensign
Maul, at the gate of the barrack-yard, cried to the sol-
diers: “Turn out, and I will stand by you; kill them;
stick them; knock them down; run your bayonets through
them.” One soldier after another leveled a ﬁrelock, and
threatened to “make a lane” through the crowd.

3. Just before nine, as an oﬂicer crossed King Street,
now State Street, a barber’s lad cried “after him: ‘;-There
goes a mean fellow Who hath not paid my father’ for ‘dress-
ing his hair; ” on which, the sentinel stationed at the West-
erly end of the custom-house, on the corner of King Street
and Exchange Lane, left his post, and with his musket
gave the boy a stroke on the head, that made him stagger

and cry for pain.
(5.—16.)

4. The street soon became clear, and nobody troubled
the sentry, when a party of soldiers issued violently from
the main guard, their arms glittering in the moonlight,
and passed on, hallooing: M.“ Where are they? where are
they? Let them come.”

5. Presently twelve or ﬁfteen more, uttering the same
cries, rushed from the south into King Street, and so by
the way of Cornhill towards Murray’s barracks; “ Pray,
soldiers, spare my life,” cried a boy of twelve, whom they
met. “No, no, I’ll kill you all,” answered one of them,
and knocked him down with his cutlass.; They abused and
insulted several persons at their doors and others in the
street; “running about like madmen in a fury,” crying,
“Fire!” which seemed their watchword, and, “Where are
they ? Knock them down.” Their outrageous behavior
occasioned the ringing of the bell at the head of King
Street.

6. The citizens, whom the alarm set in motion, came out
with canes and clubs; and, partly by the interference of
well-disposed oflicers, partly by the courage of Crispus
Attucks, a mulatto, and some others, the fray at the bar-
racks was soon over. Of the citizens, the prudent shouted,
“Home! home!” others, it is said, cried out, “ Huzza for
the main guard! there is the nest;” but the main guard
was not molested the whole evening. i

7. A body of soldiers came up Royal Exchange Lane,
crying, “ Where are the cowards?” and, brandishing their
arms, passed through King Street. From ten to twenty
boys came, after them, asking, “ Where ar.e they? where
are thgy? ” “ There‘ is the soldier who knocked me down,”
said the barber’s boy; and they began pushing one another
towards the sentinel. He loaded and primed his musket.
“The lobster is going to ﬁre,” cried a boy. Waving his

woe about, the sentinel pulled the trigger.

‘.8. “ If you ﬁre you must die for it,” said Henry Knox,

who was passing by. “I don’t care,” replied the sentry,

FIFTH READER. 243

“if they touch me, I’ll ﬁre.” “Fire!” shouted the boys,
for they were persuaded he could not do it without leave
from a civil oflicer; and a young fellow spoke out, “We
will knock him down for snapping,” while they whistled
through their ﬁngers and huzzaed. “Stand off! ” said the
sentry, and shouted aloud, “Turn out, main guard!”
“They are killing the sentinel,” reported a servant from
the custom-house, running to the main guard. “Turn
out! why don’t you turn out?” cried Preston, who was
captain of the day, to the guard. a i ‘
9. A party of six, two of whom, Kilrioi and Mont-
gomery, had been worsted at the rope-walk,’ formed, with a
corporal in front and Preston following. With bayonets
ﬁxed, they “rushed through the people” upon the trot,
cursing them, a.nd pushing them as they went along.
They found about ten persons round the sentry, while
about ﬁfty or sixty came down with them. “For God’s
sake,” said Knox, holding Preston by the coat, “take your
men back again; if they ﬁre, your life must answer for
the consequences” ‘_‘ I know what I am about,” said he
hastily, and much agitated. T  
10. None pressed on them or provoked them till the
began loading, when a party of about twelve in number,

with sticks in their hands, moved from the middle of the A”

street where they had been standing, gave three cheers,
and passed along the front of the soldiers, whose muskets
some of them struck as they went by. “You are cow-

lardlyrascals,” they said, “ for bringing arms against naked

men.” “Lay aside your guns, and we are ready for you.”
“Are the soldiers loaded?” inquired Palmes of Preston.
“ Yes,” he answered, “with powder and ball.” “Are
they going to ﬁre upon the inhabitants?” asked Theodore

Bliss. “They can not, without my orders,” replied Pres-'
ton; while “the town-born” called out, “ Come on, you
‘rascals, you bloody backs, you lobster scoundrels, ﬁre, if

you dare. We know you dare not.”

 ust then, Montgomery received a blow from a stick
which had hit his musket; and the word “ﬁre!” being

given by Preston, he stepped a little tocone side, and shot

Attucks, who at the time was quietly leaning on a long
stick. “ Don’t ﬁre!” said Langford, the watchman , to
Kilroi, looking him full in the face; but yet he did so,
and Samuel Gray, who was standing next Langford, fell
lifeless. The rest ﬁred slowly, and in succession on the
people, who were dispersing. Three persons were killed,
among them Attucks, the mulatto ; eight were wounded,
two of them mortally. Of all the eleven, not more than
one had any share in the disturbance.

12;. So infuriated were the soldiers that, when the men
returned to take up the dead, they prepared to ﬁre again,
but were checked by Preston, while the Twenty-ninth Regi-
ment appeared under arms in King Street. “This is our
time,” cried the soldiers of the Fourteenth; and dogs were
never seen more greedy for their prey.

13. The bells rung in all the churches; the town drums
beat. “To arms! to arms!” was the cry. “ Our hearts,”
said Warren, “beat to arms, almost resolved by one stroke
to avenge the death of our slaughtered brethren; ” but
they stood self"-possessed, demanding justice according to the
law. “ Did you not know that you should not have ﬁred
without the order of a civil magistrate?” asked Hutchin-
son, on meeting Preston. “ I did “it,” answered Preston,
“to save my men.”

14. The people would not be paciﬁed or retire till the
regiment was conﬁned to the guard-room and the barracks;
and Hutchinson himself gave assurances that instant in-.,.
quiries should be made by the cognty magistrates. One
hundred persons remained to keep watch on the examina-
tion, which lasted till three hours after midnight. A war-
rant was issued against Preston, who surrendered himself
to the sheriff ; and ,..,,t,,l;;,_e:.,a:siildiers of his party were delivered
up and committed to prison.

LXXVIII. SQUEERS’S METHOD.

Charles Dickens (b. 1812, d. 1870). This celebrated novelist was born
in Portsmouth, England. He began his active life as a lawyer’s ap-
prentice, in London; but soon became a reporter, and followed this
occupation from 1831 to 1886. His ﬁrst book was entitled “Sketches of
London Society, by Boz.” In .1837 he published the “Pickwick Papers,”
a work which established his reputation as a writer. His other works

followedwith great rapidity, and his last, “Edwin Drood,” was ’un-,

ﬁnished when he died. He visited America in 1842 and in 1867. He
is buried in Westminster Abbey. Mr. Dickens excelled in humor and
pathos, and was particularly successful in delineating the joys and griefs
of childhood. His writings have a tendency to prompt to deeds of kind-
ness and benevolence. The following extract is taken from “Nicholas
Nickleby,” one of the best of his novels.

1. “COME,” said Squeers, “let ’s go to the school room;
and lend me‘ a hand with my school.-coat, will you?”

Nicholas assisted his master to put on an old fustian
shooting jacket, which he took down from a peg in the

‘passage; and Squeers, arming himself with his cane, led

the way across a yard to a door in the rear of the house.

“There,” said the school-master, as they stepped in to-
gether, “this is our shop, N ickleby.”

2. It was such a crowded scene, and there were so many
objects to attract attention, that at ﬁrst Nicholas stared
about him, really without seeing any thing at all. By de-
grees, however, the place resolved itself into a bare and
dirty room with a couple of Windows, whereof a tenth part
might be of glass, the remainder being stopped up with
old copy-books and paper.

3. There were a couple of long, old, rickety desks, cut
and notched, and inked and damaged in every possible
way; twoor three forms, a detached desk for Squeers, and
another for his assistant. The ceiling was supported like
that of a barn, by cross-beams and rafters, and thepwalls
were so stained and discolored that it was impossible
to tell whether they had ever been touched by paint or
whitewash.

whose long, meager legs would hardly bear their stooping

faces which should have been handsome, darkened with the
scowl of sullen, dogged suffering: there-was childhood with

the light of its eye quenched, its beauty gone, and its

helplessness alone remaining. I
 5. And yet this scene, painful as it was, had its grotesque
features, which, in a less interested observer than Nicholas,
might have provoked a smile. Mrs. Squeers stood at one
of the desks, presiding over an immense basin of brimstone
and treacle, of which delicious compound she administered
a large installment to each boy in succession, using for the
purpose a common wooden spoon, which might have been
originally manufactured for some gigantic top, and which

widened every young gentleman’s mouth considerably, they

uﬂoeing all obliged, under heavy corporeal penalties, to take

in the whole bowl at a gasp. i

6. “Now,” said Squeers, giving the desk a great rap
with his cane, which made half the little boys nearly jump
out of their boots, “is that physicking over?”

“Just over,” said Mrs. Squeers, choking the last boy ‘in
her hurry, and tapping the crown of his head with the
wooden spoon to restore him. “Here, you Smike: take
away now. Look sharp!”

7. Smike shuffled out with the basin, and Mrs. Squeers
hurried out after him into a species of wash-house, where
there was ‘a’ small ﬁre, and a large kettle, together with a
number of little wooden bowls which were arranged upon
a board. Into these bowls Mrs. Squeers, assisted by the‘
hungry servant, poured a brown composition which looked
like diluted pin-cushions without the covers, and was called
porridge. A migkute wedge of brown bread was inserted
in each bowl, and when they had eat their porridge by

Squeers looked very profound, as if he had a perfect appre-

hension of what was inside all the books, and could say -

every word of their contents by heart, if he only chose to
take the trouble, that gentleman called up the ﬁrst class.
‘TF9. Obedient to this summons there ranged themselves

in front of the school-master’s desk, half a dozen scarecrows, ”

out at knees and elbows, one of whom placed a torn and
ﬁlthy book beneath his learned eye.

“This is the ﬁrst class in English spelling and philosophy,

him. “ We ’ll get up a Latin one, and hand that over to
you. 7 Now, then, where’s the ﬁrst boy?”

said the temporary head of the philosophical class.

) was born near Lexington, Kentucky.

While still a young girl she began to write poetry which was well re-
ceived. In 1861 she was married to the poet John James Piatt. Mrs.
Piatt’s poetry is marked by tender pathos, thoughtfulness, and musical
ﬂow of rhythm. The following selection is from “ That New World.”

1.

THEY were two Princes doomed to death;
Each loved his beauty and his breath:
“Leave us our life and we will bring
Fair gifts unto our lord, the King.”

They went together. In the dew

A charmed bird before them ﬂew.
Through sun and thorn one followed it;
Upon the other’s arm it lit.

A rose, whose faintest ﬂush was worth
All buds that ever blew on earth,

One climbed the rocks to reach; ah, well,
Into the other’s breast it fell.

Weird jewels, such as fairies wear,
When moons go out, to light their hair,
One tried to touch on ghostly ground;

"Gems of quick ﬁre the other found.

One with the dragon fought to gain
The enchanted fruit, and fought in Vain;
The other breathed the garden’s air

And gathered precious apples there.

. Backward to the imperial gate

One took his fortune, one his fate:
One showed sweet gifts from sweetest lands,
The other, torn and empty hands.

7. At bird, and rose, and gem, and fruit,
The King was sad, the King was mute;
At last he slowly said: “ My son,

True treasure is not lightly won.

Only these scars, show more to me
Than if a kingdom’s price I found
In place of each forgotten wound.”

LXXX. CAPTURING THE WILD HORSE.

1. WE left the buffalo camp about eight o’clock, and
had a toilsome and harassing march of two hours, over
ridges of hills covered with a ragged forest of scrub oaks,
and broken by deep gullies.

2. About ten o’clock in the morning we came to where

this line of rugged hills swept down into a valley, through

which ﬂowed the north fork of Red River. A beautiful
meadow, about half a mile Wide, enameled with yellow,
autumnal ﬂowers, stretched for two or three miles along
the foot of the hills, bordered on the opposite side by the
river, whose banks were fringed with cotton-wood trees,
the bright foliage of which refreshed and delighted the
eye, after being wearied by the contemplation of monot-
onous wastes of brown forest.

3. The meadow was ﬁnely diversiﬁed by groves and
clumps of trees, so happily disposed that they seemed as if

254 ECLECHC SERI ES.

set out by the hand of art. As we cast our eyes over this
fresh and delightful valley, we beheld a troop of wild
horses quietly grazing on a green lawn, about a mile dis-
tant, to our right, while to our left, at nearly the same
distance, were several buffaloes ; some feeding, others re-
posing, and ruminating among the high, rich herbage,
under the shade of a clump of cotton-wood trees. The
whole had the appearance of a broad, beautiful tract of
pasture-land, on the highly ornamented estate of some gen-
tleman farmer, with his cattle grazing about the lawns and
meadows.   »

4. A‘ council of war was now held, and it was deter-
mined’ to proﬁt by the present favorable opportunity, and
try our hand at the grand hunting maneuver which is
called “ ringing the wild horse.” This requires a large
party of horsemen, well mounted. They extend themselves
in each direction, at a certain distance apart, and gradu-
ally form a ring of two or three miles in circumference, so
as to surround the game. This must be done with extreme
care, for the wild horse is the most readily alarmed inhab-
itant of the prairie, and can scent a hunter‘ at great dis-
taislce, if to windward. 4
9&5. The ring being formed, two or three ride toward the
horses, which start off’ - in an opposite direction. Whenever
they approach the bounds of the ring,‘however, a ‘hunts;
man presents himself, and turns them from their course.

In this way they are checked, and driven back at every»

point, and kept galloping round and round -this magic
circle, until, being completely tired down, it is easy for
hunters to ride up beside them and throw the lariat over

their heads. The prime horses of the most speed, courage,_
and bottom, however, are apt to break through and escape, ‘

so that, in general, it is the second-rate horses that are
taken.

6. Preparations were now made for a hunt of this kind.
Thevpack-horses were now taken into the woods and ﬁrmly

FIFTH READER. 255

tied to trees, lest in a rush of wild horses they should
break away. Twenty-ﬁve men were then sent under the
command of a lieutenant to steal along the edge of the
valley within the strip of wood that skirted the hills.
They were to station themselves about ﬁfty yards apart,

within the edge of the woods, and not advance or show-

themselves until the horses dashed in that direction.

Twenty-ﬁve men were sent across the valley to steal in ,

like manner along the river bank that bordered the oppo-
site side, and to station themselves among the trees.

7. A third party of about the same number was to form
a line, stretching across the lower part of the valley, so as
to connect the two wings. Beatte and our other half-breed,
Antoine, together with the ever-ofﬁcious Tonish, were to
make a circuit through the woods so as to get to the upper
part of the valley, in the rear of the horses, and drive
them forward into the kind of sack that we had formed,
while the two wings should join behind them and make a
complete circle.

8. The ﬂanking parties were quietly extending them-
selves out of sight, on each side of the valley, and the res-
idue were stretching themselves like the links of a chain
across it, when the wild horses gave signs that. they scented
; snuﬂing the air, snorting, and looking about.
“ th they pranced of slowly toward the river, and
peared behind a green bank.

 . Here, had the regulations of the chase been observed,
they would have been quietly checked and turned back by
A the advance of a hunter from the trees. Unluckily, how-
ever, we had our wild-ﬁre, J ack-o’lantern little Frenchman
to deal with. Instead of keeping quietly up the right side
of the valley, to get above the horses, the moment he saw
them move toward the river he broke out of the covert of
woods and dashed furiously across the plain in pursuit of
— them. This put an end to all «system. a ’The half-breeds,
and half a score of rangers, joined in the chase.”

    
 

255 EOLEOTIO SERIESC

10. Away they all went over the green bank. In a
moment or two the wild horses re-appeared, and came thun-
dering down the valley, with Frenchman, half-breeds, and
rangers galloping and bellowing behind them. It was in
vain that the line drawn across the valley attempted to
check and turn back the fugitives; they were too hotly
pressed by their pursuers: in their panic they dashed
through the line, and clattered down the plain. ,

11. The whole troop joined in the headlong chase, some
of the rangers without hats or caps, their hair ﬂying about
their ears, and others with handkerchiefs tied round their
heads. The buffaloes, which had been calmly ruminating
among the herbage, heaved up their huge forms, gazed for
a moment at the tempest that came scouring down the
meadow, then turned and took to heavy, rolling ﬂight.
They were soon overtaken; the promiscuous throng were
pressed together by the contracting sides of the Valley,
and away they went, pell-mell, hurry-skurry, wild buffalo,
wild horse, wild huntsman, with clang and clatter, and
whoop and halloo, that made the forests ring.

12. At length the buffaloes turned into a green brake,
on the river bank, while the horses dashed up a narrow
deﬁle of ‘ the hills, with their pursuers close to-their heels.
Beatte passed several of them, having ﬁxed his eye upon a
ﬁne Pawnee horse that had his ears slit and saddle marks
upon his back. He pressed him gallantly, but lost him in
the Woods. _

13. Among the wild horses was a ﬁne black mare, which
in scrambling up the deﬁle tripped and fell. A young
ranger sprang from his horse, and seized her by the mane
and muzzle. Another ranger dismounted and came to his
assistance. The mare struggled ﬁercely, kicking and bit-
ing, and striking with her forefeet, but a noose was slipped
over her head, and her struggles were in Vain. ,

14. It was some time, however, before she gave over
rearing and plunging, and lashing out with her feet on

FIFTII READER. 257

every side. The two rangers then led her along‘: the valley,
by two strong lariats, which enabled them to keep at a
sufficient distance on each side to be out of the reach of
her hoofs, and Whenever she struck out in one direction
she was jerked in the other. In this Way her spirit was
gradually subdued.

15. As to Tonish, Who had marred the Whole scheme by

his precipitancy, he had been more successful than be de-.

served, having managed to catch a beautiful cream-colored
colt about seven months old, that had not strength to keep
up With its companions. The mercurial little Frenchman
was beside himself with exultation. It was amusing to
see himiwith his prize. The colt Would rear and kick, and
struggle to get free, when Tonish would take him about the
neck, Wrestle With him, jump on his back, and cut as many
antics as a monkey With a kitten.

16. Nothing surprised me more, however, than to Witness
how soon these poor animals, thus taken from the un-
bounded freedom of the prairie, yielded to the dominion of
man. In the course of two or three days the mare and
colt went with the lead horses and became quite docile.

LXXXI. SOWING AND REAPING.

Adelaide Anne Procter (b. 1825, d. 1864) was the daughter of Bryan
Waller Procter (better known as “Barry Cornwall”), a celebrated En-
glish poet, living in London. Miss Procter’s ﬁrst Volume, “Legends
and Lyrics,” appeared in 1858, and met With great success; it was re-
published in this country. A second series, under the same name, Was
published in 1860; and in 1862 both series were republished with addi-
tional poems, and an introduction by Charles Dickens. In 1861 Miss
Procter edited “ Victoria Regia ” a collection of poetical pieces, to which
she contributed; and in 1862 “A Chaplet of Verses,” composed of her
own poems, was published. Besides these Volumes, she contributed
largely to various magazines and periodicals.

For the sheaves of golden grain.

To eat your hard-earned bread;

For the hungry must be fed.

In the warm earth’s bosom deep,
And your Warm tears fall upon it—

Or your own heart’s trembling fears,

LXXXII. TAKING COMFORT.

1. FOR the last few days, the ﬁne weather has led me
away from books and papers, and the close air of dwell-
ings, into the open ﬁelds, and under the soft, warm sun-
shine, and the softer light of a full moon. The loveliest

season of the whole year——that transient but delightful

interval between the storms of the “ wild equinox, with all
their wet,” and the dark, short, dismal days which precede
the rigor of winter——is now with us. The sun rises through
a soft and hazy atmosphere; the light mist-clouds melt
gradually before him; and his noon-tide light rests warm
and clear on still woods, tranquil waters, and grasses green
with the late autumnal rains.

2. One ﬁne morning, not long ago, I strolled down the
Merrimac, on the Tewksbury shore. I know of no Walk
in the vicinity of Lowell so inviting as that along the
margin of the river, for nearly a mile from the village of
Belvidere. The path winds, green and ﬂower—skirted, among
beeches and oaks, through whose boughs you catch glimpses

250 EOLEOTIC SERIES.

of waters sparkling and dashing below. Rocks, huge and
picturesque, jut out into the stream, affording beautiful
views of the river and the distant city.

8. Half fatiguedwith my walk, I threw myself down
upon a rocky slope of the bank, where the panorama of
earth, sky, and water lay clear and distinct about me.
Far above, silent and dim as a picture, was the city, with
its huge mill-masonry, confused chimney-tops, and church-
spires; near it rose the height of Belvidere, with its
deserted burial-place and neglected grave-stones sharply
deﬁned on its bleak, bare summit against the sky; before
me the river went dashing down its rugged channel, send-
ing up its everlasting murmur; above me the birch-tree
hung its tassels; and the last wild ﬂowers of autumn pro-
fusely fringed the rocky rim of the water.

4. Right opposite, the Dracut woods stretched upwards
from the shore, beautiful with the hues of frost, glowing
with tints richer and deeper than those which Claude or
Poussin mingled, as if the rainbows of a summer shower
had fallen among them. At a little distance to the right,
a group of cattle stood mid-leg deep in the river; and a
troop of children, bright-eyed and mirthful, were casting
pebbles at them from a projecting shelf of rock. Over all
a warm but softened sunshine melted down from a slum-
berous autumnal sky.

"ﬁfth 5. My revery was disagreeably broken. A low, grunting
sound, half bestial, half human, attracted my attention. I
was not alone. Close beside me, half’ hidden by a tuft of
bushes, lay a human being, stretched out at full length,
with his face literally rooted into the gravel. A little boy,
ﬁve or six years of age, clean and healthful, with his fair
brown locks and blue eyes, stood on the bank above, gazing
down upon him with an expression of childhood’s simple
and unaffected pity.

6. “VVhat ails you?” asked the boy at length. “What
makes you lie there?”

The prostrate groveler struggled half-Way up, exhibiting
the bloated and ﬁlthy countenance of a drunkard. He
made two or three efforts to get upon his feet, lost his
balance, and tumbled forward upon his face.

“ \Vhat are you doing there?” inquired the boy.

“I’m taking comfort,” he muttered, with his mouth in
the dirt.

7. Taking his comfort! There he lay,——squalid and

loathsome under the bright heaven,——an imbruted man.
The holy harmonies of Nature, the sounds of gushing
Waters, the rustle of the leaves above him, the Wild ﬂow-
ers, the frost-bloom of the woods,———-what were they to him?
Insensible, deaf, and blind, in the stupor of a living death,
he lay there, literally realizing that most bitterly signiﬁcant

LXXXIII. CALLING THE ROLL.

1. “ CORPORAL GREEN!” the orderly cried;
“Here!” was the answer, loud and clear,
From the lips of a soldier standing near;
And “ here!” was the word the next replied.
“ Cyrus Drew!” and a silence fell;

This time no answer followed the call;

Only his rear-man saw him fall,
Killed or wounded he could not tell.

2. There they stood in the failing light,
These men of battle, with grave, dark looks,
As plain to be-read as open books,

While slowly gathered the shades of night.

The fern on the slope was splashed with blood,
And down in the corn, where the poppies grew,
Were redder stains’ than the poppies knew;

And crimson-dyed was the river’s ﬂood.

3. For the foe had crossed from the other side,
That day, in the face of a murderous ﬁre
That swept them down in its terrible ire;

And their life-blood went to color the tide.

“Herbert Cline!” At the call there 'came
Two stalwart soldiers into the line,
Bearing between them Herbert Cline,

Wounded and bleeding, to answer his name.

4. “ Ezra Kerr!” and a Voice said. “ here!”
“ Hiram Kerr!” but no man replied:
They were brothers, these two; the sad ‘wind sighed,
And a shudder crept through the corn-ﬁeld near.

Of a hundred men who Went into the ﬁght,
Numbered but twenty that answered “here!”

LXXXIV. TURTLE SOUP.

Charles Frederick Briggs (b. 1804, d. 1877) was born on the island of
Nantucket. When quite young, however, he became a resident of New
York City. In 1845, in conjunction with Edgar A. Poe, he began the
publication of the “Broadway Journal ; ” he was also connected with
the “ New York Times,” and the “Evening Mirror; ” also as editor from
1853 to 1856 with “ Putnam’s Magazine.” Mr. Briggs wrote a few novels,
some poetry, and numerous little humorous tales and sketches. The
following selection is from “Working a Passage; or, Life on a Liner,”
one of his best stories.

1. AMONG the luxuries which the captain had provided
for himself and passengers was a ﬁne green turtle, which

was not likely to suffer from exposure to salt water, so it ‘

was reserved until all the pigs, and sheep, and poultry had
been eaten. A few days before we arrived, it was deter-
mined to kill the turtle and have a feast the next day.

 2. Our cabin gentlemen had been long enough deprived
of fresh meats to make them cast lickerish glances towards
their hard-skinned friend, and there was a great smacking
of lips the day before he was killed. As‘ I walked aft

occasionally, I heard them congratulat-

ing themselves on their prospective tur- 
tle—soup and force-meat balls; and one of
them, to heighten the luxury
of the feast, ate nothing but
a dry biscuit for the twenty-
four hours preceding, that he
might be prepared
to devour his full
share of the unctu-
ous compound.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

3. It was to be a gala day with them; and though it
was not champagne day, that falling on Saturday and this
on Friday, they agreed to have champagne a day in ad-
vance, that nothing should be wanting to give a ﬁnish to

their turtle. It happened to be a rougher day than usual

when the turtle was cooked, but they had become too Well .

used to the motion of the ship to mind that.

4. It happened to be my turn at the wheel the hour be-
fore dinner, and I had the tantalizing misery of hearing
them laughing and talking about their turtle, while I was
hungry from want of dry bread and salt meat. I had res-

olutely kept my thoughts from the cabin during all the.

passage but once, and now I found my ideas clustering
round a tureen of turtle in spite of all my philosophy.

5. Confound them, if they had gone out of my hearing»

with their exulting smacks, I should not have envied their

. soup, but their hungry glee soexcited my imagination that

I could see nothing through the glazing of the binnacle
but a white plate with a slice of lemon on the rim, a loaf
of delicate bread, a silver spoon, a napkin, two or three
wine glasses of different hues and shapes, and a water
goblet clustering round it, and a stream of black, thick,
and fragrant turtle pouring into the plate. n

6. By and by it was four bells: they dined at three.
And all the gentlemen, with the captain at their head,
darted below into the cabin, where their mirth increased
when they caught sight of the soup plates. “Hurry with
the soup, steward,” roared the captain. “Coming, sir,”
replied the steward. In a few moments the cook opened
the door of his galley, and out came the delicious steam
of the turtle. '

7. Then came the steward with a large covered tureen
in his hand, towards the cabin gangway. I forgot the ship
for a moment in looking at this precious cargo, the wheel
slipped from my hands, the ship broached to with a sudden
jerk; the steward had got only one foot upon the stairs,
when this unexpected motion threw him off his balance,
and down he went by the run, the tureen slipped from his
hands, and part of its contents ﬂew into the lee scuppers,
and the “balance followed him in his fall.

8. I laughed outright. I enjoyed the turtle a thousand
times morethan I should have done if I had eaten the whole

moment the steward ran upon deck, followed by the cap-
tain, in a furious rage, threatening if he caught him to
throw him overboard. Not a spoonful of the soup had
been left in the coppers, for the steward had taken it all
away at once to keep it warm. In about an hour after-
wards the passengers came upon deck, looking more sober
than I had seen them since we left Liverpool. They had
dined upon cold ham.

LXXXV. THE BEST KIND OF REVENGE.

1. SOME years ago a warehouseman in Manchester, En-
gland, published a scurrilous pamphlet, in which he endeav-
ored to hold up the house of Grant Brothers to ridicule.
William Grant remarked upon the occurrence that the man
would live to repent of what he had done; and this was
-conveyed by some tale-bearer to the libeler, who said, “ Oh,
I suppose he thinks I shall some time or other be in his
debt; but I will take good care of that.” It "happens,

FIFTH READER. 267

however, that a man in business can not always choose
who shall be his creditors. The pamphleteer became a
bankrupt, and the brothers held. an acceptance of his
which had been indorsed to them by the drawer, who had
also become a bankrupt.

2. The wantonly libeled men had thus become creditors
of the libeler! They now had it in their power to make

him repent of his audacity." He could not obtain his cer-.

tiﬁcate without their signature, and without it he could not
enter into business again. He had obtained the number
of signatures required by the bankrupt law except one. It
seemed folly to hope that the ﬁrm of “the brothers” would
supply the deﬁciency. What! they who had cruelly been
made the laughing-stock of the public, forget the wrong and
favor the wrong-doer? He ‘despaired. But the claims of a
wife and children forced him at last to make the applica-
tion. Humbled by misery, he presented himself at the
counting-house of the wronged.

13. Mr. William Grant was there alone, and his ﬁrst
words to the delinquent were, “Shut the door, sir!”
sternly uttered. The door was shut, and the libeler stood
trembling before the libeled. He told his tale and pro-
duced his certiﬁcate, which was instantly clutched by the
injured merchant. “You wrote a pamphlet against us
once!” exclaimed Mr. Grant. The suppliant expected to
see his parchment thrown into the ﬁre. But this was not
its destination. Mr. Grant «took a pen, and writing some-
thing upon the document, handed it back to the bankrupt.
He, poor wretch, expected to see “rogue, scoundrel,
libeler,” inscribed; but there was, in fair round characters,
the signature of the ﬁrm.

4. “We make it a rule,” said Mr. Grant, “ never to re-
fuse signing the certiﬁcate of an honest tradesman, and we
have never heard that you were any thing else.” The
tears started into the poor _man’s eyes.‘ “Ah,” said Mr.
Grant, “ my saying was true! I said you would live to

3. I knew when seven justices could not make up a quarrel;
but when the parties met themselves, one of them thought but
of an if; as, If you said so, then I said so; 0 ho! did you say
so‘? So they shook hands and were sworn brothers.

REMARKs.—In the first example, the emphasis is that of contrast. The
queen had poisoned her husband, of which she incorrectly supposed her
son ignorant, and she blames him for treating his father-in-law with dis-

respect. In his reply, Hamlet contrasts her deep crime with his own

slight offense, and the circumﬂex upon “you’ becomes proper.

In the second example the emphasis is ironical. The-Spaniards pre-
tended that they would protect the Peruvians if they would submit to
them, Whereas it was evident that they merely desired to plunder and
destroy them. Thus their protection is ironically called “ such protec-
tion as vfiltures give to°lambs,” etc.

In the third example, the word “ so” is used hypothetically; that is, it
implies a condition or supposition. It will be observed that the rising
circumﬂex is used in the ﬁrst “so,” and the falling, in the second, be-
cause the ﬁrst “so ” must end with the rising inﬂection and the second
With the falling inﬂection according to previous rules.

MONOTON E.

When no Word in a sentence receives an inﬂection, it
is said to be read in a monotone; that is, in nearly the
same tone throughout. This uniformity of tone is occa-
sionally adopted, and is ﬁtted to express solemnity T or
sublimity of idea, and sometimes intensity of feeling. It
is used, also, when the Whole sentence or phrase is em-
phatic. In books of elocution, when it is marked at all,
it is generally marked thus (——), as in the lines follow-
mg.

repent writing that pamphlet. I did not mean it as a
threat. I only meant» that some day you would know us
better, and be sorry you had tried to injure us. I see you
repent of it now.” “I do, I do!” said the grateful man;
“I bitterly repent it.” “VVell, well, my dear fellow, you
know us now. How do you get on? What are you going
to do?” The poor man stated he had friends who could
assist him when his certiﬁcate was obtained. “But how
are you off in the meantime?”

5. And the answer was, that, having given up every
farthing to his creditors, he had been compelled to stint
his family of even common necessaries, that he might be
enabled to pay the cost of his certiﬁcate. “ My dear
fellow, this will not do; your family must not suffer. Be
kind enough to take this ten-pound note to your wife from

.me. There, there, my- dear fellow! Nay, do not cry; it

will all be well with you yet. Keep up your spirits, set to
work like a man, and you will raise your head among us
yet.” The overpowered man endeavored in vain to express
his thanks; the swelling in his throat forbade words. He
put his handkerchief to his face and went out of the door,
crying like a child.

DEFINITIoNs.—1. Ware’house-man (English usage), one who
keeps a wholesale store for woolen goods. Se1“1r’ril-o1'1s, low, mean.
Li’bel-er, one who defames another maliciously by a writing, etc.
2. Au—dac’i-ty, bold impudence. Sigma-tﬁre, the name of a person

sheep or goat shin prepared for writing upon. 5. Stint, to limit.

NOTE.—1. Acceptance. When a person upon whom a draft has
been made, writes his name across the face of it, the draft then
becomes “an acceptance.” The person who makes the draft is
called “the drawer;” the person to whom the money is ordered
paid writes his name on the back of the draft and is called “an
indorser.” Paper of ’ this kind frequently passes from hand to
hand, so that there are several indorsers.

LXXXVI. THE SOLDIER or‘ THE RHINE.

Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton (b. 1808, d. 1877) was the grand-

daughter of Richard Brinsley Sheridan. She wrote verses and plays
at a very earlyage. “The Sorrows of Rosalie,” published in 1829, was
written before she was seventeen years old. In 1827, she was married
to the Hon. George Chapple Norton. The marriage was an unhappy
one, and they were divorced in 1836. Her principal works are “The
Undying One,” “The Dream, and Other Poems,” “The Child of the
Islands,” “Stuart of Dunleith, a Romance,” and “English Laws for
English Women of the 19th Century.” She contributed extensively to
the magazines and other periodicals.

LXXXVIII. THE PEEVISH WIFE.

Maria. Edgeworth (b. 1767, cl. 1849) was born near Reading, Berkshire,
England. In 1782 her father removed with his family to Edgeworthtown,
Ireland, to reside on his estate. She lived here during the remainder of
her life, With the exception of occasional short visits to England, Scot-
land, and France. She was educated principally by her father, and they
were co-laborers in literary productions, among which were “Essays on

Practical Education,” and the “Parent’s Assistant.” Her novels and ,

tales were Written without assistance, and her fame as a Writer rests on
them. The best known of these are “Castle Rackrent,” “Moral Tales,”
“Tales of Fashionable Life,” “Frank,” “The Modern Griselda,” and
“Helen.” Miss Edgeworth excels in the truthful. delineation of char-
acter, and her Works are full of practical good sense and genuine humor.

friend of mine.

tion. I

Mr. B. Irony? my dear, I was perfectly in earnest.

Mrs. B. Yes, yes; in earnest; so I perceive; I may
naturally be dull of apprehension, but my feelings are
quick enough; I comprehend too well. Yes, it is impossi-
ble to judge of a Woman before marriage, or to guess What
sort of a Wife she will make. I presume you speak from
experience; you have been disappointed yourself, and re-
pent your choice.

Upon my Word, I meant no such thing. I really Was not
thinking of you in the least. ;

Mrs. B. No, you never think of me now. I can easily
believe that you were not thinking of me in the least.

Mrs. B. Do you laugh at me? When it comes to this
I am wretched indeed. Never man laughed at the Woman
he loved. As long as you had the slightest remains of
love for me you could not make me an object of derision;
ridicule and love are incompatible, absolutely incompatible.

I happy, but in vain. I see I am not cut out to be a good

Alfred Tennyson (b. 1809, ) was born in Somersby, Lincolnshire,
England. He graduated at Trinity College, Cambridge. His ﬁrst volume
of poems was published in 1830, but it made little impression and Was se-
verely criticised. On the publication of his third series in 1842, his poetic
genius began to receive general recognition. Mr. Tennyson was made
poet laureate in 1850, and is now regarded as the foremost living poet of

 

England. For several years past his residence has been on the Isle of .

Wight. In 1884, he Was raised to the peerage.

IV. ACCENT.

In every Word which contains more than one syllable,
one of the syllables is pronounced with a somewhat
greater stress of voice than the others. This syllable is
said to be accented. The accented syllable is distinguished
by this mark (’ ), the same which is used in inﬂections.

EXAMPLES.
Love’ly, re-turn’, re-mem’ber,
Con’stant, re-main’,  a-sun’der,
Mem’ber, a-bide’, a-ban’ d011,
Win’ dow, a-tone’, rec-ol-lect’,
Ban’ ner, a-lone’, re-em-bark’.

REMARK.—In most cases custom is the only guide for placing the accent
on one syllable rather than another. Sometimes, however, the same
Word is differently accented in order to mark its different meanings.

EXAMPLES.

O'on’jure, to practice enchantments. Conjure’, to entreat.
Gal’lant, brave. Gal-lcmt’, a gay fellow.
Au’ gust, a month. Au-gust’, grand.

REMARK.——A number of Words, used sometimes as one part of speech,
and sometimes as another, vary their accents irregularly.

EXAMPLES.

Pres’ent, the noun.

_ I
Pres’ent, the adjective. i Pm sent’ the verb’
Corn’-pact’, the adjective.

I
Compact, the noun. { COm_pact,, the Verb.

In Words of more than two syllables there is often a second accent
given, but more slight than the principal one, and this is called the sec-
ondary accent; as, car'a-van”, 'rep”ar-tee’, where the principal accent is
marked (’), and the secondary (”) ; so, also, this accent is obvious in new”-
i-ga'tion, com/’pre-hen’sion, plau”si-bz'l’i-ty, etc. The Whole subject, how-
ever, properly belongs to dictionaries and spelling-books.

XCI. TRANSPORTATION AND PLANTING OF SEEDS.

Henry David Thoreau (b. 1817, d. 1862). This eccentric American
author and naturalist was born at Concord, Mass. He graduated at Har-
vard University in 1837. He was a good English and classical scholar,
and was well acquainted with the literature of the East. His father was
a maker of lead-pencil.s, and he followed the business fora time, but after-
wards supported himself mainly by teaching, lecturing, land surveying,
and carpentering.‘ In 1845 he built himself a small wooden house near
Concord, on the shore of Walden Pond, where he lived about two years.
He was intimate with Hawthorne, Emerson, and other literary celebri-
ties. His principal works are “ Walden, or Life in the Woods,” “A VVeek
on Concord and Merrimac Rivers,” “ Excursions," “Maine Woods,”
“ Cape.Cod,” “A Yankee in Canada,” and “Letters to Various Persons.”
In descriptive power Mr. Thoreau has few if any superiors.

1. IN all the pines a very thin membrane, in appearance
much like an insect’s wing, grows over and around the
seed, and independent of it, while the latter is being de-
veloped within its base. In other words, a beautiful thin
sack is woven around the seed, with a handle to it such as
the wind can take hold of, and it is then committed to the
wind, expressly that it may transport the seed and extend
the range of the species; and this it does as effectually
as when seeds are sent by mail, in a different kind of sack,
from the patent office.

2. There is, then, no necessity for supposing that the
pines have sprung up from nothing, and I am aware that
I am not at all peculiar in asserting that they come from
seeds, though the mode of their propagation by Nature has
been but little attended to. They are very extensively
raised from the seed in Europe, and are beginning to be
here. -

3. When you cut down an oak wood, a pine wood will
not at once spring up there unless there are, or have been
quite recently, seed-bearing pines near enough for the seeds
to be blown from them. But, adjacent to a forest of pines,
if you prevent other crops from growing there, you will

surely have an extension of your pine forest, provided the
soil is suitable.

4. As I walk amid hickories, even in August, I hear the
sound of green pig-nuts falling from time to time, cut off
by the chickaree over my head. In the fall I notice on
the ground, either within or in the neighborhood of oak
woods, on all sides of the town, stout oak twigs three or

four inches long, bearing half a dozen empty acorn cups,‘

which twigs have been gnawed off by squirrels, on both
sides of the nuts, in order to make them more portable.
The jays scream and the red squirrels scold while you are
clubbing and shaking the chestnut trees, for they are there
on the same errand, and two of a trade never agree.

5. I frequently see a red or a gray squirrel cast down a
green chestnut burr, as I am going through the Woods,
and I used to think, sometimes, that they were cast at me.
In fact, they are so busy about it, in the midst of the
chestnut season, that you can not stand long in the woods
without hearing one fall.

6. A sportsman told me that he had, the day before—

’ that was in the middle of October———seen a green chestnut

burr dropped on our great river meadow, ﬁfty rods from the
nearest wood, and much farther from the nearest chestnut
tree, and he could not tell how it came there. Occasion-
ally, when chestnutting in midwinter, I ﬁnd thirty or forty
nuts in a pile, left in its gallery just under the leaves, by
the common wood-mouse.

7. But especially, in the winter, the extent to which
this transportation and planting of nuts is carried on, is
made apparent by the snow. In almost every Wood you
will see Where‘ the red or gray squirrels have pawed down
through the ‘snow in a hundred places, sometimes two feet
deep, and almost always directly to a nut or a pine—cone,—as
directly as if they had started from it and bored upward,—
which you and I could not have done. It would be diffi-

no doubt, they had deposited them there in the fall. You
Wonder if they remember the localities or discover them by
the scent.

8. The red squirrel commonly has its winter abode in
the earth under a thicket of evergreens, frequently under a
small clump of evergreens in the midst of a deciduous
Wood. If there are any nut trees,‘ which still retain their
nuts, standing at a distance without the wood, their paths
often lead directly to and from them. We, therefore, need
not suppose an oak standing here and there in the Wood in
order to seed it, but if a few stand within twenty or thirty
rods of it, it is suﬂicient.

9. I think that I may venture to say that every white-
pine cone that falls to the earth naturally in this town,
before opening and losing its seeds, and almost every pitch-
pine one that falls at all, is cut off by a squirrel; and they
begin to pluck them long before they are ripe, so that
when the crop of white-pine cones is a small one, as it
commonly is, they cut off thus almost every one of these
before it fairly ripens.

10. I think, moreover, that their design, if I may so -

speak, in cutting them off green, is partly to prevent their

opening and losing their seeds, for these are the ones for e

which they dig through the snow, and the only White-pine
cones which contain any thing then. I have counted in
one heap the cores of two hundred and thirty-nine pitch-
pine cones which had been cut off and stripped by the red
squirrel, the previQ_1_1_s Winter.

11. The nuts thus left on the surface, or buried just be-
neath it, are placed in the most favorable circumstances for
germirrating. I have sometimes Wondered how those which
merely fell on the surface of the earth got planted; but,
byithe end of December, I ﬁnd the chestnut of the same
year partially mixed with the mold, as it Were, under the
decaying and moldy leaves, Where there is all the moist-
ure and manure they want, for the nuts fall fast. In »a

plentiful year a large proportion of the nuts are thus cov-
ered loosely an inch deep, and are, of course, somewhat
concealed from squirrels.

12. One winter, when the crop had been abundant, I
got, with the aid of ra rake, many quarts of these nuts as
late as the tenth of January; and though some bought at
the store the same day were more than half of them

moldy, I did not ﬁnd a single moldy one among those .

which I picked from under the wet and moldy leaves,
where they had been snowed on once or twice. Nature
knew how to pack them best. They were still plump and
tender. Apparently they do not heat there, though wet.
In the spring‘-they are all sprouting.

13. Occasionally, when threading the woods in the fall,
you will hear a sound as if some one had broken a twig,
and, looking up, see a jay pecking at an acorn, or you will
see a ﬂock of them at once about it, in the top of an oak,
and hear them break it off. I They then ﬂy to a suitable
limb, and placing the acorn under one foot, hammer away
at it busily, making a sound like a woodpecker’s tapping,

‘looking round from time to time to see if any foe is ap-

proaching, and soon reach the meat, and nibble at it, hold-
ing up their heads to swallow while they hold the remain-
der very ﬁrmly with their claws. Nevertheless, it often
drops to the ground before the bird has done with it.

14. I can conﬁrm what William Barton wrote to Wilson,
the ornit_l_1_o_logist, that “The jay is one of the most useful

A agents in the economy of nature for disseminating forest

trees and other nu£_i__ferous and hard-seeded vegetables on
which they feed. In performing this necessary duty they
drop abundance of seed in their ﬂight over ﬁelds, hedges,
and‘ by fences, where they alight to deposit them in the
post-holes, etc. It is remarkable what numbers of young
trees rise up in ﬁelds and pastures after a wet winter and

’ spring. These birds alone are capable in a few years’ time

to replant all the cleared lands.”

15. I have noticed that squirrels also frequently drop
nuts in open land, which will still further account for the
oaks and walnuts which spring up in pastures; for, depend
on it, every new tree comes from a seed. VVhen I examine
the little oaks, one or two years old, in such places, I__ in-
variably ﬁnd the empty acorn from which they sprung.

XCII. SPRING AGAIN.

Celia Thaxter, whose maiden name was Laighton, was born in

Portsmouth, N. H. Much of her early life was passed on White Island, ”

one of a group of small islands, called the Isles of Shoals, about ten
miles from the shore, where she lived in the light-house cottage. In
l867—68, she published, in the “Atlantic Monthly,” a number of papers
on these islands, which were afterwards bound in a separate volume.
Mrs. Thaxter is a contributor to several periodicals, and in strength and
beauty of style has few equals among American writers. The following
selection is from a Volume of her poems entitled “Drift Weed.”

1. I STOOD on the height in the stillness
And the planet’s outline scanned,
And half was drawn with the line of sea
And half with the far blue land.

In the crystal deeps of the sky,
Like shapes of dreams, the gleaming gulls
Went slowly ﬂoating by.

XCIII. RELIGION THE ONLY BASIS OF SOCIETY.

William Ellery Channing (I). 1780, d. 1842) an eminent divine and
orator, was bor11 at Newport, R. I. He graduated from Harvard with the
highest honors in 1798, and, in 1803, he was made pastor of the Federal
Street Church, Boston, with which he maintained his connection until
his death. Towards the close of his life, being much enfeebled, he With-
drew almost entirely from his pastoral duties, and devoted himself to
literature. Dr- Channing’s writings are published in six volumes, and
are mainly devoted to theology.

1. RELIGION is a social concern; for it operates power-
fully on society, contributing in various Ways to its stability
and prosperity. Religion is not merely a private affair;
the community is deeply interested in its diffusion; for it is
the best support of the virtues and principles, on which the
social order rests. Pure and undeﬁled religion is, to do
good; and it follows, very plainly, that if God be the
Author and Friend of society, then, the recognition of him
must enforce all social duty, and enlightened piety must
give its whole strength to public order.

FIFTH READER. 235

2. Few men suspect, perhaps no man comprehends, the
extent of the support given by religion to every virtue.
No man, perhaps, is aware, how much our moral and
social sentiments are fed from this fountain; how powerless
conscience would become Without the belief of a God; how
palsied would be human benevolence, were there not the
sense of a higher benevolence to quicken and sustain it;

how suddenly the Whole social fabric would quake, and.

with What a fearful crash it would sink into hopeless ruin,
Were the ideas of a Supreme Being, of accountableness and

4 of a future life to be utterly erased from every mind.

3. And, let men thoroughly believe that they are the
Work and sport of chance; that no superior intelligence
concerns itself with human affairs; that all their improve-
ments perish forever at death; that the Weak have no
guardian, and the injured no avenger; that there is no
recompense for sacriﬁces to uprightness and the public
good; that an oath is unheard in heaven; that secret
crimes have no witness but the, perpetrator; that human
existence has no purpose, and human virtue no unfailing
friend; that this brief life is every thing to us, and death
is total, everlasting extinction; once let them thoroughly
abandon religion, and who can conceive or describe the
extent of the desolation which would follow?

4. We hope, perhaps, that human laws and natural

A sympathy would hold society together. As reasonably

might We believe, that Were the sun quenched in the

heavens, our torches Would illuminate, and our ﬁres quicken

and fertilize the creation. What is there in human nature
to awaken respect and tenderness, if man is the unpro-
tected insect of a day? And What is he more, if atheism
be true?

5. Erase all thought and fear of God from a commu-
nity‘, and selﬁshness and sensuality would absorb the Whole

‘ man. Appetite, knowing no restraint, and suffering, having

no solace or hope, would trample in scorn on the restraints

of human laws. Virtue, duty, principle, would be mocked
and spurned as unmeaning sounds. A sordid self-interest
would supplant every feeling; and man would become, in
fact, What the theory in atheism declares him to be,—a
companion for brutes.

XCIV. ROCK ME TO SLEEP.

Elizabeth Akers Allen (b. 1832, ): was born at Strong, Maine,
and passed her childhood amidst the picturesque scenery of that neigh-
borhood. She lost her mother when very young, but inherited her
grace and delicacy of thought. Shortly after her mother’s death, her
father removed to Farmington, Maine, a town noted for its literary
people. Mrs. A11en’s early pieces appeared over the pseudonym of
“Florence Percy.” Her ﬁrst verses appeared when she was twelve
years old; and her ﬁrst volume, entitled “ Forest Buds from the Woods
of Maine,” Was published in 1856. For some years she was assistant-
editor of the “ Portland Transcript.” The following selection Was
claimed by ﬁve different persons, Who attempted to steal the honor
of its composition.

1. BACKWARD, turn backward, 0 Time, in your ﬂight,
Make me a child again, just for to-night! '
Mother, come back from the echoless shore,

Take me again to your heart as of yore;

Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;
Over my slumbers your loving Watch keep;——
Rock me to sleep, mother,——rock me to sleep!

FIFTH READER. 237

2. Backward, ﬂow backward, O tide of the years!

I am so weary of toil and of tears;

Toil without recompense, tears all in vain;
Take them, and give me my childhood again!
I have grown weary of dust and decay,———
Weary of ﬂinging my soul-wealth away;
Weary of sowing for others to reap; —

Rock me to sleep, mother,—rock me to sleep’

3. Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,
Mother, 0 mother, my heart calls for you!
Many a summer the grass has grown green,
Blossomed and faded, our faces between:

Yet with strong yearning and passionate pain,
Long I to-night for your presence again.

Come from the silence so long and so deep ;— a
Rock me to sleep, mother,—rock me to sleep!

4. Over my heart in the days that are ﬂown,
No love like mother—love ever has shone;
N 0 other worship abides and endures,
Faithful, unselﬁsh, and patient like yours:
None like a mother can charm away pain
From the sick soul, and the world-weary brain.
Slumber’s soft calms o’er my heavy lids creep;—-
Rock me to sleep, mother,—rock me to sleep!

5. Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,

Fall on your shoulders again, as of old;

Let it drop over my forehead to-night,

Shading my faint eyes away from the light;

For with its sunny-edged shadows once more,
Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore;
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep ;—
Rock me to sleep, mother,—rock me to sleep!

V. EMPHASIS.

A word is said to be emphasized when it is uttered with

a greater stress of voice than the other Words with which

it is connected.

REMARK 1.--The object of emphasis is to attract particular attention to

the word upon which it is placed, indicating that the idea to be conveyed .

depends Very much upon that Word. This object, asjust stated, is gener-
ally accomplished by increasing the force of utterance, but sometimes,
also, by a change in the inﬂection, the use of the monotone, by pause, or
by uttering the words in a very low key. Emphatic words are often de-
noted by italics, and a still stronger emphasis by SMALL CAPITALS or
CAPITALS, according to the degree of emphasis desired.

REMARK 2.—Emphasis constitutes the most important feature in read-
mg and speaking, and, properly applied, gives life and character to lan-
guage. Accent, inﬂection, and indeed every thing yields to emphasis.

REMARK 3.—In the following examples it will be seen that accent is
governed by it.

EXAMPLES.

What is done, can not be undone.
There is a difference between giving and forgiving.
He that descended is the same that ascended.

Some appear to make Very little difference between decency
and indecency, morality and immorality, religion and irreligion.

REMARK 4.—There is no better illustration of the nature and impor-
tance of emphasis than the following examples. It will be observed that
the meaning and proper answer of the question Vary with each change
of the emphasis.

EXAMPLES.

QUESTIONS. ANSWERS.

Did you Walk into the city yesterday? No, my brother Went.

Did you walla into the city yesterday? No, I rode.

Did you Walk into the city yesterday? No, I Went into the
country.

Did you walk into the city yesterday? No, I went the day
before. .

Since I last listened your lullaby song;
Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem
Womanhood’s years have been only a dream;
Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,
With your light lashes just sweeping my face,
~ Never hereafter to wake or to weep;—
Rock me to sleep, mother,—rock me to sleep!

XCV. MAN AND THE INFERIOR. ANIMALS.

1. THE chief difference between man and the other ani-
mals consists in this, that the former has reason, whereas
the latter have only instinct; but, in order to understand
what We mean by the terms reason and instinct, it will be
necessary to mention three things in which the difference
very’ distinctly appears.

2. Let us first, to bring the parties as nearly on a level
as possible, consider man in a savage state, wholly occu-
pied, like the beasts of the ﬁeld, in providing for the wants
of his animal nature; and here the ﬁrst distinction. that
appears between them is the use of implements. When.
the savage provides himself with a hut or a Wigwam for
shelter, or that he may store up his provisions, he does no
more than is done by the rabbit, the beaver, the bee, and
birds of every species.

3. But the man can not make any progress in this work
without tools; he must provide himself with an ax even
before he can cut down a tree for its timber; whereas
these animals form their burrows, their cells, or their nests,
with no other tools than those with which nature has pro-

, vided them. In cultivating the ground, also, man can do

nothing without a spade or a plow; nor can he reap what
he has sown till he has shaped an implement with which to

FIFTII READER. 289

out down his harvest. But the inferior animals provide for
themselves and their young without any of these things.

4. N ow for the second distinction. Man, in all his oper-
ations, makes mistakes; animals make none. Did you
ever hear of such a thing as a bird sitting on a twig
lamenting over her half-ﬁnished nest and puzzling her little
head to know how to complete it? Or did you ever see
the cells of a bee-hive in clumsy, irregular shapes, or ob-
serve any thing like a discussion in the little community,
as if there were a difference of opinion among the archi-
tects?

5. The lower animals are even better physicians than we
are; for when they are ill, they will, many of them, seek
out some particular herb, which they do not use as food,
and which possesses a medicinal quality exactly suited to
the complaint; whereas, the whole college of physicians
will dispute. for a century‘ about the virtues of a single
drug. ‘

6. Man undertakes nothing in which he is not more or
less puzzled; and must try numberless experiments before
he can bring his undertakings to any thing like perfection;
even the’ simplest operations of domestic life are not well
performed without some experience; and the term of man’s
life is half wasted before he has done with his mistakes
and begins to proﬁt by his lessons.

7. The third distinction is that animals make no im-

J provements; while the knowledge, and skill, and the suc-

cess of man are perpetually on the increase. Animals, in

‘all their operations, follow the ﬁrst impulse of nature or

that instinct which God has implanted in them. In all
they do undertake, therefore, their works are more perfect
and regular than those of man. .

8. But man, having been endowed with the faculty of
thinking or reasoning -about What he does, is enabled by

patience and industry to correct the mistakes into which he

at ﬁrst falls, and to go on constantly improving. A bird’s

nest is, indeed, a perfect structure; yet the nest of a swal-
low of the nineteenth century is not at all more commodi-
ous or elegant than those that were built amid the rafters
of Noah’s ark. But if We compare the Wigwam of the
savage with the temples and palaces of ancient Greece and
Rome, We then shall see to What man’s mistakes, rectiﬁed
and improved upon, conduct him.

XCVI. THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT.

John Godfrey Saxe (b. 1816, d. 1887), an American humorist, lawyer,
and journalist, was born at Highgate, Vt. He graduated at Middlebury
College in 1839; was admitted to the bar in 1843; and practiced law

until 1850, When he became editor of the “Burlington Sentinel.” In-

1851 he Was elected State’s Attorney. “Progress, a Satire, and Other
Poems,” his ﬁrst volume, Was published in 1849, and several other vol-
umes of great merit attest his originality. For genial humor and good-
natured satire, Saxe’s Writings rank among the best of their kind, and
are very popular.

1. IT was SIX men of Indostan,
To learning much inclined,
Who Went to see the elephant,
(Though all of them were blind,)
That each by observation I
Might satisfy his mind. ‘

FIFTH READER. 291

2. The ﬁrst approached the elephant,
And, happening to fall
Against his broad and sturdy side,
At once began to bawl:
“ God bless me! but the elephant
Is very like a Wall! ”

3. The second, feeling of the tusk,
Cried: “ Ho! what have We here,
So very round, and smooth, and sharp?
To me ’t is very clear,
I This Wonder of an elephant
Is very like a spear!”

4. The third approached the animal,
And, happening to take
The squirming trunk within his hands,
Thus boldly up he spake:
“I see,” quoth he, “the elephant
Is Very like a snake!”

5. The fourth reached out his eager hand,
And fell about the knee:
“Whatemost this Wondrous beast is like,
Is Very plain,” quoth he;
“ ’T is clear enough the elephant
Is very like a tree!”

6. The ﬁfth,Who chanced to touch the ear,

Said: “ E’en the blindest man

Can tell What this resembles most:
Deny the fact who can,

This marvel of an elephant
Is Very like a fan!”

,7. The sixth no sooner had begun
About the beast to grope,
Than, seizing on the swinging tail.
That fell within his scope,
“I see,” quoth he, “the elephant
Is very like a rope!”

8. And so these men of Indostan
Disputed loud and long,
Each in his own opinion
Exceeding stiff‘ and strong,
Though each was partly in the right,
And all were in the Wrong!

XCVII. A HOME SCENE.

Donald Grant Mitchell (b. 1822, ). This popular American
writer was born in Norwich, Conn. He graduated at Yale in 1841. In
1844 he went to England, and, after traveling through that country on
foot, spent some time on the continent. His ﬁrst volume, “Fresh
Gleanings, or a New Sheaf from the Old Fields of Continental Europe,
by Ik. Marvel,” was published i_n 1847, soon after his return home. He
revisited Europe in 1848. On his return, he published “The Battle
Summer.-'1' Mr. Mitchell has contributed to the “ Knickerbocker Maga-
zine,” the “ Atlantic Monthly,” and several agricultural journals. His
most popular works are “ The Reveries of a Bachelor,” 1850, and “ Dream
Life,” 1851. Besides these, he has written “My Farm of Edgewood,” “ Wet
Days at Edgewood,” “Doctor Johns,” a novel, “Rural/Studies,” and
other works. He is a charming writer. In 1853 he “was appointed
United States consul at Venice. In 1855 he settled on a farm near New
Haven, Conn., where he now resides. The following‘ selection is from
“Dream Life. ” !

 

1. LITTLE does the boy know, as the tide of years drifts
by, ﬂoating him out insensibly from the harbor of his home,
upon the great sea of life,———What joys, What opportunities,
what affections, are slipping from him into the shades of
that inexorable Past, where no man can go, save on the
Wings of his dreams.

FIFTH READER. 293

2. Little does he think, as he leans upon the lap of his
mother, with his eye turned to her, in some earnest plead-
ing for a fancied pleasure of the hour, or in some important
story of his griefs, that such sharing of his sorrows, and such
sympathy with his wishes, he will ﬁnd nowhere again.

3. Little does he imagine that the fond sister Nelly, ever
thoughtful of his pleasures, ever smiling away his griefs,

will soon be beyond the reach of either; and that the waves .

of the years which come rocking so gently under him will
soon toss her far away, upon the great swell of life.

4. But now, you are there. The ﬁre-light glimmers up-
on the walls of your cherished home. The big chair of
your father is drawn to its wonted corner by the chimney
side; his head, just touched with gray, lies back upon its
oaken top. Opposite sits your mother: her ﬁgure is thin,
her look cheerful, yet subdued;——her arm perhaps resting
on your shoulder, as she talks to you in tones of tender
admonition, of the days that are to come.

5. The cat is purring on the hearth; the clock that
ticked so plainly when Charlie died is ticking on the mantel

still. The great table in the middle of the room, with its  

books and work, waits only for the lighting of the evening
lamp, to see a return to its stores of embroidery and of
story. '

6. Upon a little stand under the mirror, which catches
now and then a ﬂicker of the ﬁre-light, and makes it play,
as if in wanton, upon. the ceiling, lies that big book, rever-
enced of your New England parents———the Family Bible.

‘It is a ponderous, square volume, with heavy silver clasps,

that you have often pressed open for a look at its quaint,
old pictures, or for a study of those prettily bordered pages,
which lie between the Testaments, and which hold the
Family Record.

tance back. Then, there are the Marriages; -—only one as
yet; and your mother’s name looks oddly to you: it is hard
to think of her as any one else than your doting parent.

8. Last of all came the Deaths;—only one. Poor Charlie!
How it looks! —“Died, 12 September, 18—, Charles Henry,
aged four years.” You know just how it looks. You have
turned to it often; there you seem to be joined to him,
though only by the turning of a leaf. .

9. And over your thoughts, as you look at that page of
the Record, there sometimes wanders a Vague, shadowy fear,
which will come,—that your own name may soon be there.

« You try to drop the notion, as if it were not fairly your

own; you affect to slight it, as you would slight a boy who
presumed on your acquaintance, but whom you have no
desire to know.

10. Yet your mother—how strange it is!——has no fears
of such dark fancies. Even now, as you stand beside her,
and as the twilight deepens in the room, her low, silvery
voice is stealing upon your ear, telling you that she can
not be long with you;——that the time is coming, when
you must be guided by your own judgment, and struggle
with the world unaided by the friends of your boyhood.

11. There is a little pride, and a great deal more of
anxiety, in your thoughts now, as you look steadfastly into
the home-blaze, while those delicate ﬁngers, so tender of your
happiness, play with the locks upon your brow. To struggle
with the world,-—that is a proud thing; to struggle alone,—
there lies the doubt! Then crowds in swift upon the calm
of boyhood the ﬁrst anxious thought of youth.

12. The hands of the old clock upon the mantel, that
ticked off , the hours when Charlie sighed, and when Charlie

died, draw on toward midnight. The shadows that the-

ﬁre-ﬂame makes, grow dimmer and dimmer. And thus it
is, that Home,——boy-home, passes away foreVer,—like the
swaying of a pendulum,—like the fading of a shadow on
the ﬂoor.

of Lord Byron,” and “The Epicurean, an Eastern tale.” “Moore’s excel-
lencies,” says Dr. Angus, “ consist in the gracefulness of his thoughts,
the wit and fancy of his allusions and imagery, and the music and
reﬁnement of his versiﬁcation.”

1. OFT in the stilly night
Ere slumber’s chain has bound me,
Fond memory brings the light
Of other days around me:
The smiles, the tears
Of boyhood’s years,
The words of love then spoken;
The eyes that shone,
Now dimmed and gone,
The cheerful hearts now broken!
Thus in the stilly night
Ere slumber’s chain has bound me,
Sad memory brings the light
Of other days around me.

2. When I remember all
The friends so linked together
I ’ve seen around me fall _
Like leaves in wintry weather,
I feel like one
Who treads alone
Some banquet-hall deserted,
Whose lights are ﬂed
Whose garlands dead,
And all but he departed.
Thus in the stilly night
Ere slumber’s claim has bound me,
Sad memory brings the light
Of other days around me.

XCIX. A CHASE IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL.

James Fenimore Cooper (b. 1789, d. 1851). This celebrated American
novelist was born in Burlington, N. J. His father removed to the state
of New York about 1790, and founded Cooperstown, on Otsego Lake.
He studied three years at Yale, and then entered the navy as a com-
mon sailor. He became a midshipman in 1806, and was afterwards
promoted to thetrank of lieutenant; but he left the service in 1811.
His ﬁrst novel, “Precaution," was published in 1819; his best Work,
“The Spy." a tale of the Revolutionary War, in 1821. The success of
“ The Spy” was almost unprecedented, and its author at once took
rank among the most popular Writers of the day. “The Pilot” and
“The Red Rover " are considered his best sea novels. “ The Pioneers,”
“The Last of the Mohicans,” “The Prairie,” “The Pathﬁnder,” and
“The Deerslayer,” are among the best of his tales of frontier life.
The best of his novels have been translated into nearly all of the
European languages, and into some of those of Asia. “The creations
of his genius,” says Bryant, “shall survive through centuries to come,
and only perish with our language.” The following selection is from
“The Pilot.” .

1. THE ship which the American frigate had now to
oppose, was a vessel of near her own size and equipage;
and when Griffith looked at her again, he perceived that

FIFTH READER. 297

she had made her preparations to assert her equality in
manful ﬁght.

2. Her sails had been gradually reduced to the usual
quantity, and, by certain movements on her decks, the
lieutenant and «his constant attendant, the Pilot, well un-
derstood that she only wanted to lessen the distance a few
hundred yards to begin the action.

“ Now spread every thing,” whispered the stranger.

3. Griffith applied the trumpet to his mouth, and shouted, T

in a voice that was carried even to his enemy, “ Let fall——
out with your booms—sheet home—hoist away of every
thing!” i

4. The inspiring cry was answered by a universal bustle.
Fifty men ﬂew out on the dizzy heights of the different
spars, while broad sheets of canvas rose as suddenly along
the masts, as if some mighty bird were spreading its wings.
The Englishman instantly perceived his mistake, and he an-
swered the artiﬁce by a roar of artillery. Griﬂith watched
the effects of the broadside with an absorbing interest as

the shot whistled above his head; but when he perceived,

his masts untouched, and the few unimportant ropes only
that were cut, he replied to the uproar with a burst of
pleasure.

5. A few men were, however, seen clinging with wild
frenzy to the cordage, dropping from rope to rope, like
wounded birds ﬂuttering through a tree, until they fell
heavily into the ocean, the sullen ship sweeping by them
in a cold indifference. At the next instant, the spars and

G masts of their enemy exhibited a display of men similar
v to their own, when Griffith again placed the trumpet to

his mouth, and shouted aloud, “ Give it to them; drive
them from their yards, boys; scatter them with your grape;
unreeve their rigging!”

6. The crew of the American wanted but little encour-

- agement to enter on this experiment with hearty good

will, and the close of his cheering words was uttered amid

ABSOLUTE EMPHASIS.

Sometimes a Word is emphasized simply to indicate the
importance of the idea. This is called absolute emphasis.

' EXAMPLES.

To arms! they come I the Greek! the Greek!
Woe unto you, PHARIsEEs! HYPOCRITESI
Days, months, years, and ages shall circle away.

REMARK.-—In instances like the last, it is sometimes called the emphasis
of speciﬁcation.

RELATIVE EMPHASIS.

Words are often emphasized in order to exhibit the idea
they express as compared or contrasted with some other
idea. This is called relative emphasis.

EXAMPLES.

A friend can not be known in prosperity: an enemy can not be
hidden in adversity.
It is much better to be injured than to injure.

REMARK.——II1 many instances one part only of the antithesis is ex-
pressed, the corresponding idea being understood; as,

A friendly eye would never see such faults;

Here the unfriendly eye is understood.

King Henry exclaims, While vainly endeavoring to compose

’ himself to rest,

“How many thousand of my poorest subjects
Are at this hour asleep I ”

Here the emphatic Words thousands, subjects, and asleep are
contrasted in idea with their opposites, and if the contrasted
ideas were expressed it might be in this way:

While I alone, their sovereign, am doomed to wakefulness.

the deafening roar of his own cannon. The Pilot had,
however, mistaken the skill and readiness of their foe; for,
notwithstanding the disadvantageous circumstances under
which the Englishman increased his sail, the duty was
steadily and dexterously performed.

7. The two ships were now running rapidly on parallel
lines, hurling at each other theirinstruments of destruction
with furious industry, and with severe a11d certain loss
to both, though with no manifest advantage in favor of
either. Both Griffith and the Pilot witnessed, with deep
concern, this unexpected defeat of their hopes; for they
could not conceal from themselves that each moment less-
ened 'their velocity through the water, as the shot of the
enemy stripped the canvas from the yards, or dashed aside
the lighter spars in their terrible progress.

8. “We ﬁnd our equal here,” said Griffith to the stranger.
“The ninety is heaving up again like a mountain; and if
we continue to shorten sail at this rate, she will soon be
down upon us!”  

“You say true, sir,” returned the Pilot, musing, “the
man shows judgment as well as spirit; but————”

9. He was interrupted by Merry, who rushed from the

forward part of the vessel, his whole face betokening the i

eagerness of his spirit and the importance of his intelli-
gence.———

“ The breakers!” he cried, when nigh enough to be heard
amid the din; “We are running dead on a ripple, and the
sea is white not two hundred yards ahead.”

10. The Pilot jumped on a gun, and, bending to catch
a glimpse through the smoke, he shouted, invthose clear,
piercing tones, that could be even heard among the roar-
ing of the cannon,—— ,

“Port, port your helm! we are on the Devil’s Grip!
Pass up the trumpet, sir; port your helm, fellow; give it to
them, boys——-give it to the proud English dogs!”

11. Griﬂith unhesitatingly relinquished the symbol of his

FIFTH READER. 299

rank, fastening his own ﬁrm look on the calm but quick
eye of the Pilot, and gathering assurance from the high
conﬁdence he read in the countenance of the stranger. The
seamen were too busy with their cannon and the rigging to
regard the new danger; and the frigate entered one of the
dangerous passes of the shoals, in the heat of a severely
contested battle.

12. The wondering looks of a few of the older sailors

glanced at the sheets of foam that ﬂew by them, in doubt
whether the wild gambols of the waves were occasioned by
the shot of the enemy; when suddenly the noise of cannon
was succeeded by the sullen wash of the disturbed element,
and presently the vessel glided out of her smoky shroud, and
was boldly steering in the center of the narrow passages.

13. For ten breathless minutes longer the Pilot continued
to hold an uninterrupted sway, during which the vessel ran
swiftly by ripples and breakers, by streaks of foam and
darker passages of deep water, when he threw down his
trumpet and eXclaimed———

“What threatened to be our destruction has proved our T

salvation.—Keep yonder hill crowned with wood one point
open from the church tower at its base, and steer east and
by north; you will run through these shoals on that course
in an hour, and by so doing you will gain ﬁve leagues of
your enemy, who will have to double their trail.”

14. Every oﬂicer in the ship, ‘after the breathless suspense
of uncertainty had passed, rushed to those places where a
view might be taken of their enemies. ' The ninety was
still steering boldly onward, and had already approached
the two-and-thirty, which lay a helpless wreck, rolling on
the unruly seas that were rudely tossing her on their wanton
billows. The frigate last engaged was running along the
edge of the ripple, with her torn sails ﬂying loosely in the
air, her ragged spars tottering in the breeze, and every
thing above her hull exhibiting the confusion of a sudden
and unlocked-for check to her progress.

15. The exulting taunts and mirthful congratulations of
the seamen, as they gazed at the English ships, were, how-
ever, soon forgotten in the attention that was required to
theirrown vessel. The drums beat the retreat, the guns
were lashed, the wounded again removed, and every indi-
vidual able to keep the deck was required to lend his
assistance in repairing the damages to the frigate, and
securing her masts. p

16. The promised hour carried the ship safely through
all the dangers, which were much lessened by day-light;
and by the time the sun had begun to fall over the land,
Griﬂith, who had not quitted the deck during the day,
beheld his vessel once more cleared of the confusion of the
chase and battle, and ready to meet another foe.

C. BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE.

Charles Wolfe (b. 1791, d. 1823), an Irish poet and clergyman, was born
in Dublin. He was educated in several schools, and graduated at the uni-
versity of his native city. He was ordained in 1817, and soon became
noted for his zeal and energy as a clergyman. His literary productions
were collected and published in 1825. “The Burial of Sir John Moore,”
one of the ﬁnest poems of its kind in the English language, was written
in 1817, and ﬁrst appeared in the “ N ewry Telegraph,” a newspaper, with

the author’s initials, but without his knowledge. Byron said of this.

ballad that he would rather be the author of it than of any one ever
written. a

1. NOT a drum was heard, not a funeral note,
As his corse to the rampart we hurried;
Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
O’er the grave where our hero was buried.

2. We buried him darkly, at dead of night,
The sods with our bayonets turning,
By the struggling moonbeam’s misty light,
And the lantern dimly burning.

3. No useless coﬂin inclosed his breast,
Not in sheet or in shroud we wound him;
But he lay like a Warrior taking his rest,
With his martial cloak around him.

4. Few and short were the prayers we said,
And we spoke not a word of sorrow;
But we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead,
And we bitterly thought of the morrow.

5. We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed,
And smoothed down his lonely pillow,
That the foe and the stranger would tread o’er
his head,
And We far away on the billow!

And o’er his cold ashes upbraid him; I
But little he ’ll reck, if they ’ll let him sleep on
In the grave where a Briton has laid‘ him.

7. But half of our heavy task was done,
When the clock struck the hour for retiring;
And we heard the distant and random gun
That the foe was sullenly ﬁring.

8. Slowly and sadly we laid him down,
From the ﬁeld of his fame, fresh and gory;
We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone,
But we left him alone with his glory!

NOTE.—-Sir John Moore (1). 1761, al. 1809) was a celebrated
British general. He was appointed commander of the British
forces in Spain, in the war against Napoleon, and fell at the
battle of Corunna, by a cannon shot. Marshal Soult, the oppos-
ing French commander, caused a monument to be erected to his
memory. The British government has also raised a monument
to him in St. Paul’s Cathedral, while his native city, Glasgow,
honors him with a bronze statue.

CI. LITTLE VICTORIES.

1. “  MOTHER, now that I have lost my limb, I can

_never be a soldier or a sailor; I can never go round the

world!” And Hugh burst into tears, now more really
afflicted than he had ever been yet. His mother sat on
the bed beside him, and wiped away his tears as they

FIFTH READER. 303

ﬂowed, while he told her, as well as his sobs would let
him, how long and how much he had reckoned on going
round the world, and how little he cared for any thing else
in future; and now this was the very thing he should never
be able to do!

2. He had practiced climbing ever since he could re-
member, and now this was of no use; he" had practiced

marching, and now he should never march again. When ,

he had ﬁnished his complaint, there. was a pause, and his
mother said,

“Hugh, you have heard of Huber?”

“The man who found out so much about bees?” said
Hugh.

“Bees and ants. When Huber had discovered more
than had ever been known about these, and when he was
sure that he could learn still more, and was more and more
anxious to peep into their tiny homes and curious ways,
he became blind.”

3. Hugh sighed, and his mother went on.

“Did you ever hear of Beethoven? He was one of the
greatest musical composers that ever lived. His great, his
sole delight was in music. It was the passion of his life.
When all his time and all his mind were given to music,
he suddenly became deaf, perfectly deaf; so that he never
more heard one single note from the loudest orchestra.
While crowds were moved and delighted with his compo-
sitions, it was all silence to him.” Hugh said nothing.

4. “Now do you think,” asked his mother—and Hugh

. saw that a mild and gentle smile beamed from her counte-
nance—-—“ do you think that these people were without a

Heavenly Parent?” .

“O no! but were they patient?” asked Hugh.

“ Yes, in their different ways and degrees. Would you
suppose that they were hardly treated? Or would you not

' rather suppose that their Father gave them something

better to do than they had planned for themselves?”

304 EOLEOTIO SERIES.

5. “He must know best, of course; but it does seem
very hard that that very thing should happen to them.
Huber would not have so much minded being deaf, per-
haps; or that musical man, being blind.

“N o doubt their hearts often swelled within them at
their disappointments; but I fully believe that they very
soon found God’s will to be wiser than their wishes. They
found, if they bore their trial Well, that there was work
for their hearts to do far nobler than any the head could
do through the eye or the ear. And they soon felt a new
and delicious pleasure which none but the bitterly disap-
pointed can feel.”

“What is that?”

6. “The pleasure of rousing the soul to bear pain, and
of agreeing with God silently, when nobody knows what is
in the breast. There is no pleasure like that of exercising
one's soul in bearing pain, and of ﬁnding one’s heart glow
with the hope that one is pleasing God.”

“Shall I feel that pleasure?”

“Often and often, I have no doubt; every time you can
willingly give up your wish to be a soldier or a sailor, or
any thing else you have set your mind upon, you will feel
that pleasure. But I do not expect it of you yet. I dare
say it was long a bitter thing to Beethoven to see hundreds
of people in raptures with his music, when he could not
hear a note of it.”

7. “But did he ever smile again?” asked Hugh. ,

“If he did, he was happier than all the ﬁne music in the
world could have made him,” replied his mother.

“I wonder, oh, I wonder, if I shall ever feel so! ”

“We will pray to God that you may. Shall we ask
him now?” Hugh’ clasped his hands. His mother kneeled
beside the bed, and, in a very few words, prayed that
Hugh might be able to bear his misfortune well, and that
his friends might give him such help and comfort as God
should approve.

FIFTH READER. 305

8. Hugh found himself subject to very painful feelings
sometimes, such as no one quite understood, and such as he
feared no one was able to pity as they deserved. On one
occasion, when he had been quite merry for a while, and
his mother and his sister Agnes were chatting, they thought

they heard a sob from the sofa. They spoke to Hugh, and .

found that he was indeed crying bitterly.

“What is it, my dear?” said his mother. “Agnes,

have we said any thing that could hurt his feelings?”

“No, no,” sobbed Hugh. “I will tell you, presently.”
~ 9. And, presently, he told them that he was so busy list-
ening to what they said that he forgot everything else,
when he felt as if something had gotten between two of his
toes; unconsciously he put down his hand as if his foot
were there! Nothing could be plainer than the feeling in
his toes; and then, when he put out his hand, and found
nothing, it was so terrible, it startled him so! It was a
comfort to ﬁnd that his mother knew about this. She
came, and kneeled by his sofa, and told him that many
persons who had lost a limb considered this the most pain-
ful thing they had to bear for some time; but that, though
the feeling would return occasionally through life, it would
cease to be painful.

10. Hugh was very much dejected, and when he thought
of the months and years to the end of his life, and that he
should never run and play, and never be like other people,
he almost wished that he were dead. .

Agnes thought that he must be miserable indeed if he

' could venture to say this to his mother. She glanced at
 her mother’s face, but there was no displeasure there. On

the contrary, she said this feeling was very natural. She
had felt it herself under smaller misfortunes than Hugh’s;
but she had found, though the prospect appeared all strewn
with troubles, that they came -singly, and were not so hard

. to bear, after all.

11. She told Hugh that when she was a little girl she
(5.—20.) '

306 EOLECTIO SERIES.

was very lazy, fond of her bed, and not at all fond of
dressing or washing.

“Why, mother! you?” exclaimed Hugh.

“Yes; that was the sort of little girl I was. Well, I
was in despair, one day, at the thought that I should have
to wash,and clean my teeth, and brush my hair, and put on
every article of dress, every morning, as long as I lived.”

“Did you tell any body?” asked Hugh. y

12. “No, I was ashamed to do that; but I remember I
cried. You see how it turns out. When we have become
accustomed to any thing, we do it without ever thinking
of the trouble, and, as the old fable tells us, the clock
that has to tick so many millions of times, hasexactly the
same number of seconds to do it in. So will you ﬁnd that
you can move about on each separate occasion, as you wish,
and practice will enable you to do it without. any trouble
or thought.”

“But this is not all, nor half what I mean,” said Hugh.

13. “No, my dear, nor half what you will have to bear.
You resolved to bear it all patiently, I remember. But
what is it you dread the most?”

“ Oh! all manner of things. I can never do like other
people.”

“Some things,” replied his mother. “You can never
play cricket, as every Crofton boy would like to do. You
can never dance at your sister’s Christmas parties.”

14. “O mammal” cried Agnes, with tears in her eyes,
and with the thought in her mind that it was cruel to talk
so.

“Go on! Go on!” cried Hugh, brightening. “You

know what I feel, mother; and you do n’t keep telling me,
as others do, and even sister Agnes, ‘sometimes, that it will
not signify much, and that I shall not care, and all that;
making out that it is no misfortune, hardly, when I know
what it is, and they don’t. Now, then, go on, mother!
What else?”

FIFTH READER. 307

15. “ There will be little checks and mortiﬁcations con-
tinually, When you see little boys leaping over this, and
climbing that, and playing at the other, While you must
stand out, and can only look on. And some people will
pity you in a way you Will not like: and some may even
laugh at you.”

“O mammal ” exclaimed Agnes.

“ Well, and What else?” said Hugh.

16. “ Sooner or later you will have to follow some way
of life determined by this accident instead of one that you
would have liked better.”

“Well, What else ?”

“I must ask you, now. I can think of nothing more;
and I hope there is not much else; for, indeed, I think
here is quite enough for a boy, or any one else, to bear.”

“I will bear it though; you will see.”

17. “You will ﬁnd great helps. These misfortunes of
themselves strengthen one’s mind. They have some advan-
tages, too. You will be a better scholar for your lameness,
I have no doubt. You will read more books, and have a
mind richer in thoughts. You Will be more beloved by us
all, and you yourself Will love God more for having given
you something to bear for his sake. God himself will help
you to bear your trials. You will conquer your troubles
one by one, and by a succession of LITTLE VICTORIES will
at last completely triumph over all.”

EMPHATIC PHRASE.

Sometimes several words in succession are emphasized,
forming What is called an emphatic phrase.

EXAMPLES.

Shall I, the conqueror of Spain and Gaul, and not only of i

the Alpine nations but of the Alps themselVes—shall I compare
myself with this HALF—YEAR—CAPTAIN?

Shall We try argument? Sir, We have been trying that for
the LAST ‘TEN YEARS.

And if thou said’st I am not peer
To any lord in \Scotland here,

EMPHATIC PAUSE.

The emphatic expression of a sentence often requires a
pause Where the grammatical construction authorizes none.
This is sometimes called the rhetorical pause. Such pauses
occur chieﬂy before or after an emphatic word or phrase,
and sometimes both before and after it.

EXAMPLES.

Rise—fellow men! our country—yet remains!
By that dread name We wave the sword on high,
And swear for her——t0 lz've—wz'th he7~———z‘.0 die.

gland. He was educated at Winchester and Oxford. About 1598 he Was
taken into the service of the Earl of Essex, as one of his secretaries. On
the Ear1’s committal to the Tower for treason, Wotton ﬂed to France; but
he returned to England immediately after the death of Elizabeth, and re-
ceived the honor of knighthood. He was King J ames’s favorite diplo-
matist, and, in 1623, was appointed provost of Eton College. Wotton

CIII. THE ART OF DISCOURAGEMENT.

Arthur Helps (b. 1817, d. 1875) graduated at Cambridge, England, in
1835. His best known works are: “Friends in Council, a Series of Read-
ings and Discourses,” “Companions of my Solitude,” and “ Realmah,” a
tale of the .“ lake dwellers” in southern Europe. He has also written. a
“History of the Spanish Conquests in America,” two historical dramas,
and several other works. Mr. Helps was a true thinker, and his writ-
ings are deservedly popular with thoughtful readers. In 1859 he was
appointed secretary of the privy council.

1. REGARDING, one day, in company with a humorous
friend, a noble vessel of a somewhat novel construction sail-
ing slowly out of port, he observed, “ What a quantity of
cold water somebody must have had down-his back.” In
my innocence, I supposed that he alluded to the Wet Work
of the artisans who had been building the vessel; but when
I came to know him better, I found that this was the form

of comment he always indulged in when contemplating any

new and great work, and that his “somebody” was the
designer of the vessel.
2. My friend had carefully studied the art of discourage-

lment, and there was a class of men whom he designated

simply as “cold-Water pourers.” It was most amusing to
hear him describe the lengthened sufferings of the man who
ﬁrst designed a wheel ; of him who ﬁrst built a boat; of the
adventurous personage who ﬁrst proposed the daring enter-
prise of using buttons, instead of ﬁsh bones, to fasten the
scanty raiment of some savage tribe.

3. Warming with his theme, he would become quite elo-
quent in describing the long career of discouragement which

310 EOLEOTIO SERIES.

these rash men had brought upon themselves, and which he
said, to his knowledge, must have shortened their lives.
He invented imaginary dialogues between the unfortunate
inventor, say of the Wheel, and his particular friend, some
eminent cold-water pourer. For,’ as he said, every man has
some such friend, Who fascinates him by fear, and to whom
he conﬁdes his enterprises in order to hear the Worst that
can be said of them. ' y
4. The sayings of the chilling friend, probably, as he ob-
served, ran thus:——-“We. seem to have gone on very well

‘for thousands of years Without this rolling thing. Your

father carried burdens on his back. The king is content to
be borne on men’s , shoulders. The high priest is not too

proud to do the same. Indeed, I question whether it is not i

irreligious to attempt to shift from men’s shoulders their
natural burdens.

5. “Then, as to its succeeding,——-for my part, I see no
chance of that. How can it go up hill? How often you
have failed before in other fanciful things of the same
nature! Besides, you are losing your time; and the yams
about your hut are only half planted. You will be a beg-
gar; and it is my duty, as a friend, to tell you so plainly.

6. “There was Nang-chung: what became of him? We
had found ﬁre for ages, in a proper way, taking a proper
time about it, by rubbing two sticks together. He must
needs strike out ﬁre at once, with iron and ﬂint; and did
he die in his bed? Our sacred lords saw the impiety of
that proceeding, and very justly impaled the man who imi-
tated heavenly powers. And, even if you could succeed
with this new and absurd rolling thing, the state would be
ruined. VV hat would become of those who carry burdens
on their backs? Put aside the vain fancies of a childish
mind, and ﬁnish the planting of your yams.”

7. It is really very curious to observe how, even i11 mod-
ern times, the arts of discouragement prevail. There are
men whose sole pretense to wisdom consists in administering

FIFTH READER. 31 1

discouragement. They are never at a loss. They are
equally ready to prophesy, with wonderful ingenuity, all
possible varieties of misfortune to any enterprise that may
be proposed; and when the thing is produced, and has met
with some success, to ﬁnd a ﬂaw in it.

8. I once saw a work of art produced in the presence of
an eminent cold-water pourer. He did not deny that it
was beautiful; but he instantly fastened upon a small crack

in it, that nobody had observed; and upon that crack he i

would dilate whenever the work was discussed in his pres-
ence. Indeed, he did not see the work, but only the crack
in it. That ﬂaw,—that little ﬂaw,—was all in all to him.

9. The cold-water pourers are not all of one form of
mind. Some are led to indulge in this recreation from gen-
uine timjdity. They really do fear that all new attempts
will fail. Others are simply envious and ill-natured. Then,
again, there is a sense of power and wisdom in prophesying
evil. Moreover, it is the safest thing to prophesy, for
hardly any thing at ﬁrst succeeds exactly in the way that it
was intended to succeed.

10. Again, there is the lack of imagination which gives
rise to the utterance of so much discouragement. For an
ordinary man, it must have been a great mental strain to
grasp the ideas of the ﬁrst projectors of steam and gas, elec-
tric telegraphs, and pain-deadening chloroform. The in-
ventor is always, in the eyes of his fellow-men, somewhat
of a madman; and often they do their best to make him so.

11. Again, there is the want of sympathy; and that is,
perhaps, the ruling cause in most men’s minds who have
given themselves up to discourage. They are not tender
enough, or sympathetic enough, to appreciate all the pain
they are giving, when, in a dull plodding way, they lay out
argument after argument to show that the project which

,_ Aéthe poor inventor has set his heart’ upon, .and upon which",
i perhaps, he has staked his fortune, will not succeed.

12. But what inventors suffer, is only a small part of

312 ECLEOTIO SERIES.

What mankind in general endure from thoughtless and un-
kind discouragement. Those high-souled men belong to the
suffering class, and must suffer; but it is in daily life that
the Wear and tear of discouragement tells so much. Pro-
pose a small party of pleasure to an apt discourager, and
see what he will make of it. It soon becomes sicklied over
with doubt and despondency; and, at last, the only hope of
the proposer is, that his proposal, when realized, will not be
an ignominious failure. All hope of pleasure, at least for
the proposer, has long been outiof the question.

IV. THE MARINER’S DREAM.

William Dimond was a dramatist and poet, living, in the early
part of this century, at Bath, _England, where he was born and re-
ceived his education. He afterwards studied for the bar in London.
His literary productions are for the most part dramas, but he has
also written a number of poems, among them the following.

1. IN slumbers of midnight the sailor-boy lay;
His hammock swung loose at the sport of the wind;
But watch-worn and weary, his cares ﬂew away,
And Visions of happiness danced o’er his mind.

2. He dreamed of his home, of his dear native bowers,
And pleasures that waited on life’s merry morn;

While Memory each scene gayly covered with ﬂowers,
And restored every rose, but secreted the thorn.

. Then Fancy her magical pinions spread Wide,

And bade the young dreamer in ecstasy rise;
Now, far, far behind him the green waters glide,
And the cot of his forefathers blesses his eyes.

The jessamine clambers in ﬂowers o’er the thatch,
And the swallow chirps sweet from her nest in the wall;
All trembling with transport, he raises the latch,‘
And the Voices of loved ones reply to his call.

A father bends o’er him with looks of delight;
His cheek is impearled with a mother’s warm tear;
And the lips of the boy in a love-kiss unite T
With the lips of the maid whom his bosom holds dear.

. The heart of the sleeper beats high in his breast;

Joy quickens his pulses,——al1 his hardships seem o’er;
And a murmur of happiness steals through his rest,-—
“O God! thou hast blest me,—I ask for no more.”

Ah! whence is that ﬂame which now bursts on his eye?
Ah! what is that sound that now ’larums his ear?
’T is the lightning’s' red glare painting hell on the sky!
’T is the crashing of thunders, the groan of the sphere!

He springs from his hammock,———he ﬂies to the deck;
Amazement confronts him with images dire;

VVild Winds and mad waves drive the Vessel a wreck;
The masts ﬂy in splinters; the shrouds are on ﬁre.

Like mountains the billows tremendously swell;

In Vain the lost wretch calls on Mercy to save;
Unseen hands of spirits are ringing his knell;

And the death-angel ﬂaps his broad wings o’er the wave!

CV. THE PASSENGER PIGEON.

John James Audubon (b. 1780, d 1851). This celebrated American or-
nithologist was born in Louisiana. When quite young he was passion-
ately fond of birds, and took delight in studying their habits. In 1797
his father, an admiral in the French navy, sent him to Paris to be edu-
cated. On his return to America, he settled on a farm in eastern Penn-
sylvania, but afterwards removed to Henderson, Ky., where he resided
several years, supporting his ‘family by trade, but devoting most of his

time to the pursuit of his favorite study. In 1826 he went to England, V

and commenced the publication of the “ Birds of America,” which con-
sists of ten vo1umes—ﬁve of engravings of birds, natural size, and ﬁve of
letterpress. Cuvier declares this work to be “the most magniﬁcent
monument that art has ever erected to ornitho1ogy.” In 1830 Audubon
returned to America, a11d soon afterwards made excursions into nearly
every section of the United States and Canada. A popular edition of his
great Work was published, in seven volumes, in 1844, and “The Quadru-
peds of America,” in six volumes,—three of plates and three of letter-
press, in 1846-50. He removed to the vicinity of New York about 1840, and
resided there until his death.

1. THE multitudes of wild pigeons in our Woods are as-
tonishing. Indeed, after having viewed them so often, and
under so many circumstances, I even now feel inclined to
pause and assure myself that what I am going to relate is
a fact. Yet I have seen it all, and that, too, in the com-
pany of persons who, like myself, were struck with amaze-
ment.

2. In the autumn of 1813 I left my house at Hender-
son, on the banks of the Ohio, on my way to Louisville.
In passing over the Barrens, a few miles beyond Hardins-
burgh, I observed the pigeons ﬂying, from north-east to
south-West, in greater numbers than I thought I had ever
seen them before, and feeling an inclination to count the
ﬂocks that might pass within the reach of my eye in one
hour, I dismounted, seated myself on an eminence, and be-
gan to mark with my pencil, making a dot for every ﬂock
that passed. I

3. In a short time, ﬁnding the task which I had under-
taken impracticable, as the birds poured in in countless
multitudes, I rose, and, counting the dots then put down,

found that one hundred and sixty-three had been made
in twenty-one minutes. I traveled on, and still met more
the farther I proceeded. The air was literally ﬁlled with
pigeons; the light of noonday was obscured as by an
eclipse; and the continued buzz of wings had a tendency
to lull my senses to repose.

4. VVhilst waiting for dinner at Young’s inn, at the con-
fluence of Salt River with the Ohio, I saw, at my leisure,
immense legions still going by, with a front reaching far
beyond the Ohio on the west, and the beech wood forests
directly on the east of me. Not a single bird alighted, for
not a nut or acorn was that year to be seen in the neigh-
borhood. They consequently ﬂew so high that different
trials to reach them with a capital riﬂe proved ineffectual;
nor did the reports disturb them in the least. i

5. I can not describe to you the extreme beauty of their
aerial evolutions when a hawk chanced to press upon the
rear of a ﬂock. At once, like a torrent, and with a noise
like thunder, they rushed into a compact mass, pressing
upon each other towards the center. In these almost solid
masses, they darted forward in undulating and angular
lines, descended and swept close over the earth with incon-
ceivable velocity, mounted perpendicularly so as to resem-
ble a vast column, and, when high, were seen wheeling and
twisting within their continued lines, which then resembled
the coils of a gigantic serpent. '

6. As soon as the pigeons discover a suﬂiciency of food
to entice them to alight, they ﬂy round in circles, review-
ing the country below. During their evolutions, on such
occasions, the dense mass which they form exhibits a bean-
tiful appearance, as it changes its direction, now displaying
a glistening sheet of azure, when the backs‘ of the birds
come simultaneously into view, and anon suddenly present-
ing a mass of rich, deep purple. i

7. They then pass lower, over the woods, and for a mo-
ment are lost among the foliage, but again emerge, and are

FIFTH READER. 31 7

seen gliding aloft. They now alight; but the next mo-
ment, as if suddenly alarmed, they taketo wing, produc-
ing by the ﬂappings of their wings a noise like the roar of
distant thunder, and sweep through the forests to see if
danger is near. Hunger, however, soon brings them to the
ground.

8. When alighted, they are seen industriously throwing

up the withered leaves in quest of the fallen mast. The

rear ranks are continually rising, passing over the main
body, and alighting in front, in such rapid succession, that
the whole ﬂock seems still on wing. The quantity of
ground thus swept is astonishing; and so completely has it
been cleared that the gleaner who might follow in their
rear would ﬁnd his labor completely lost.

9. On such occasions, when the woods are ﬁlled with
these pigeons, they are killed in immense numbers, al-
though no apparent diminution ensues. About the middle
of the day, after their repast is ﬁnished, they settle on the
trees to enjoy rest and digest their food. As the sun be-
gins to sink beneath the horizon,they depart en masses for
the roosting-place, which not unfrequently is hundreds of
miles distant, as has been ascertained by persons who have
kept an account of their arrivals and departures.

10. Let us now inspect their place of nightly rendezvous.
One of these curious roosting-_places, on the banks of the
Green River, in Kentucky, I repeatedly visited. It was,
as is always the case, in a portion of the forest where the
trees were of great magnitude, and where there was little
underwood. I rode through it upwards of forty miles, and,
crossing it in different parts, found its average breadth to
be rather more than three miles. My ﬁrst view of it was
about a fortnight subsequent to the period when they had
made choice of it, and I arrived there nearly two hours
before sunset.

11. Many trees, two feet in diameter, I observed, were
broken off at no great distance from the ground; and the

VI. MODULATION.

Modulation includes the variations of the voice. These
may be classed under the heads of Pitch, Compass, Quan-
tity, and Quality.

PITCH AND COMPASS.

If any one will notice closely a sentence as uttered in private
conversation, he will observe that very few successive words are
pronounced in exactly the same key or with the same force.
At the same time, however, there is a certain PITCH or key,
which seems, on the whole, to prevail.

This key-note, or governing note, as it may be called, is that
upon which the voice most frequently dwells, to which it usu-
ally returns when wearied, and upon which a sentence generally
commences, and very frequently ends, while, at the same time,
there is a considerable play of the voice above and below it.

This key may be high or low. It varies in different individ-
uals, and at different times in the same individual, being gov-
erned by the nature of the subject and the emotions of the
speaker. It is worthy of notice, however, that most speakers
pitch their voices on a key too high.

The range of the voice above and below this note is called
its COMPASS. When the speaker is animated, this range is
great: but upon abstract subjects, "or with a dull speaker, it is
small. If, in reading or speaking, too high a note be chosen,
the lungs will soon become wearied; if too low a pitch be se-
lected, there is danger of indistinctness of utterance; and in
either case there is less room for compass or variety of tone than
if one be taken between the two extremes.

To secure the proper pitch and the greatest compass observe
the following rule.

RULE XII.——The reader or speaker should choose that
pitch in which he can feel himself most at ease, and above
and below which he may have most room for variation.

REMARK 1.——Having chosen the proper key-note, he should beware of

conﬁning himself to it. This constitutes monotony, one of the greatest

branches of many of the largest and tallest had given Way,
as if the forest had been swept by a tornado. Every thing
proved to me that the number of birds resorting to this
part of the forest must be immense beyond conception.

12. As the period of their arrival approached, their foes
anxiously prepared to receive them. Some were furnished
with iron pots containing sulphur, others with torches of
pine knots, many with poles, and the rest with guns. The
sun was lost to our view, yet not a pigeon had arrived.
Every thing was ready, and all eyes were gazing on the
clear sky, which appeared in glimpses amidst the tall trees.
Suddenly there burst forth the general cry of, “Here they
come ll”

13. The noise which they made, though yet distant, re-
minded me of a hard gale at sea passing through the rig-
ging of a close-reefed vessel. As the birds arrived and
passed over me, I felt a current of air that surprised me.
Thousands were soon knocked down by the pole men. The
birds continued to pour in. The ﬁres were lighted, and a
magniﬁcent as well as wonderful and almost terrifying sight
presented itself.

14. The pigeons, arriving by thousands, alighted every—
where, one above another, until solid masses, as large as
hogsheads, were formed on the branches all round. Here
and there the perches gave way under the weight with a

‘crash, and falling to the ground destroyed hundreds of the

birds beneath, forcing down the dense groups with which
every stick was loaded. It was a scene of uproar and con-
fusion. I found it quite useless to speak or even to shout
to those persons who were nearest to me. Even the reports
of the guns Were seldom heard, and I was made aware of
the ﬁring only by seeing the shooters reloading.

15. The uproar continued the whole night; and as I

‘ wasanxious to know to what distance the sound reached, I

sent off a man, accustomed to perambulate the forest, who, re-

~ a turning two hours afterwards, informed me he had heard it

distinctly when three miles distant from the spot. Towards
the approach of day, the noise in some measure subsided;
long before objects were distinguishable, the pigeons began
to move off‘ in a direction quite different from that in which
they had arrived the evening before, and at sunrise all that
were able to ﬂy had disappeared.

DEFINITIoNs.——5. A-é’ri—al, belonging or pertaining to the air.
6. A-non’, in a short time, soon. 8. Mast, the fruit of oak and
beech or other forest trees. 10. Rén’dez-Vous (pro. rén’de-V66), an
appointed or customary place of meeting. S1”1b’se—quent, following
in time. 15. Per-am’bu-late, to walls through.

N oTEs.——The wild pigeon, in common with almost every va-
riety of game, is becoming more scarce throughout the country
each year; and Audubon’s account, but for the position he
holds, would in time, no doubt, be considered ridiculous.

9. En masse (pro. an mas), a French phrase meaning in a

body.

CVI. THE COUNTRY LIFE.

Richard Henry Stoddard (b. 1825———-—) was born at Hingham,
Massachusetts, but removed to New York City while quite young.
His ﬁrst volume of poems, “Foot-prints,” appeared in 1849, and has
been followed by many others. Of these may be mentioned “Songs
of Summer,” “Town and Country,” “The King’s Bell,” “Abraham
Lincoln” (an ode), and the “Book of the East,” from the last of

A which the following selection is abridged. Mr. Stoddard’s verses are

full of genuine feeling, and some of them show great poetic power.

Makes up the sum of living:

In taking and in giving.
Swords cleave to hands that sought the plow,
And laurels miss the soldier’s brow.

Have worn its stony highways,
Familiar with its loneliest street,—
Its ways were never my ways.

And there, I hope, my grave will be.

Thy Vane is seaward blowing;

Thy slip of garden stretches down
To where the tide is ﬂowing;

Below they lie, their sails all furled,

The ships that go about the world.

4. Dearer that little country house,
Inland with pines beside it;
Some peach trees, with unfruitful boughs,
A well, with weeds to hide it:
No ﬂowers, or only such as rise
Self-sown—poor things! ——which all despise.

5. Dear country home! can I forget
The least of thy sweet triﬂes?'
The window-Vines that clamber yet,
Whose blooms the bee still riﬂes?
The road-side blackberries, growing ripe,
And in the woods the Indian pipe?

6. Happy the man who tills his ﬁeld,
Content with rustic labor;
Earth does to him her fullness yield,
Hap what may to his neighbor. '
Well days, sound nights—oh, can there be
A life more rational and free?

CVII. THE VIRGINIAN S.

William Makepeace Thackeray (b. 1811, d. 1863). This popular En-
glish humorist, essayist, and novelist was born in Calcutta. He was edu-
cated at the Charter-house school in London, and at Cambridge, but he
did not complete a collegiate course of study. He began his literary
career as a contributor to “Fraser’s Magazine,” under the assumed
name of Michael Angelo Titmarsh, and afterwards contributed to the

columns of “Punch.” The ﬁrst novel published un_der Tl1ackeray’s -

ow11 name was “Vanity Fair,” which  regarded by many as his
greatest work. He afterwards wrote a large number of novels, tales,
and poems, most of which were illustrated by sketches drawn by him-
self. His course of "Lectures on the English Humorists” was deliv-
ered in London 111 1851, and the following year in several cities iii the
United States. He revisited the United States in 1856, and delivered a
course of lectures on “ The Four G-eorges,” which he repeated in Great
Britain soon after his return home. In 1560 he became the editor of
“The Cornhill Magazine,” the most successful serial ever published in
England.

1. MR. ESMOND called his American house Castlewood,
from the patrimonial home in the old country. The whole
usages of Virginia, indeed, were fondly modeled after the
English customs. It was a loyal colony. The Virginians
boasted that King Charles the Second had been king in
Virginia before he had been king in England. English king
and English church were alike faithfully honored there.

2. The resident gentry were allied to good English fami-
lies. They held their heads above the Dutch traders of
New York, and the money-getting Roundheads of Penn-
sylvania and New England. Never were people less re-

Ipublican than those of the great province which was soon

to be foremost in the memorable revolt against the British
Crown. 1

3. The gentry of Virginia dwelt on their great lands
after a fashion almost patriarchal. For its rough cultiva-
tion, each estate had a multitude of hands—of purchased
and assigned servants——Who were subject to the command

‘of the master. The land yielded their food, live stock, and

game.

4. The great rivers swarmed with ﬁsh for the taking.
From their banks the passage home was clear. Their ships
took the tobacco off their private wharves on the banks of
the Potomac or the James River, and carried it to London
or Bristol,—bringing back ‘English goods and articles of
home manufacture in return for the only produce which the
Virginian gentry chose to cultivate.

5. Their hospitality was boundless. N o stranger was ever
sent away from their gates. The gentry received one an-
other, and traveled to each other’s houses, in a state almost
feudal. The question of Slavery was not born at the time
of which we write. To be the proprietor of black servants
shocked the feelings of no Virginia gentleman; nor, in
truth, was the despotism exercised over the negro race gen-
erally a savage one. The food was plenty: the poor black
people lazy and not unhappy. You might have preached
negro emancipation to Madam Esmond of Castlewood as
you might have told her to let the horses run loose out of
her" stables; she had no doubt but that the whip and the
corn-bag were good for both. i _

6. Her father may have thought otherwise, being of a
skeptical turn on very many points, but his doubts did not
break forth in active denial, and he was rather disaffected
than rebellious. At one period, this gentleman had taken
a part in active life at home, and possibly might have been
eager to share its rewards; but in latter days he did not
seem to care for them. A something had occurred in his
life, which _had cast a tinge of ‘melancholy over all his
existence.

7. He was not unhappy,—to those about him most kind,
-—most affectionate, obsequious even to the women of his
family, whom he scarce ever contradicted; but there had
been some bankruptcy of his heart, which his spirit never
recovered. He submitted to life, rather than enjoyed it,
and never was in better spirits‘ than in his last hours when
he was going to lay it down.

8. When the boy’s grandfather died, their mother, in
great state, proclaimed her eldest son Georgeiher successor
and heir of the estate; and Harry, George’s younger brother
by half an hour, was always enjoined to respect his senior.
All the household was equally instructed to pay him honor:
the negroes, of whom there was a large and happy family,
and the assigned servants from Europe, Whose lot was made

as bearable as it might be under the government of the I

lady of Castlewood.

9. In the whole family there scarcely was a rebel save
Mrs. Esmond’s faithful friend and companion, Madam
Mountain, and Harry’s foster-mother, a faithful negro
woman, who never could be made to understand why her
child should not be ﬁrst, who was handsomer, and stronger,
and cleverer than his brother, as she vowed; though, in
truth, there was scarcely any difference in the beauty,
strength, or stature of the twins.

10. In disposition, they were in many points exceedingly
unlike; but in feature they resembled each other so closely,
that, but for the color of their hair, it had been difficult to
distinguish them. In their beds, and when their heads
were covered with those vast, ribboned nightcaps, which our
great and little ancestors wore, it was scarcely possible for
any but a nurse or a mother to tell the one from the other
child.

11. Howbeit, alike in form, we have said that they
differed in temper. The elder was peaceful, studious, and

» silent; the younger was warlike and noisy. He was quick

at learning when he began, but very slow at beginning.
No threats of the ferule would provoke Harry to learn in
an idle ﬁt, or would prevent George from helping his
brother in his lesson. Harry was of a strong militaryturn,
drilled the little negroes on the estate, and caned them like

_ a corporal, having many good boxing-matches with them,

and never bearing malice if he was worsted ; ——whereas
George was sparing bf blows, and gentle with all about him.

12. As the custom in all families was, each of the boys
had a special little servant assigned him: and it was a
known fact that George, ﬁnding his little wretch of a black-
amoor asleep on his master’s bed, sat down beside it, and
brushed the ﬂies off the child with a feather-fan, to the
horror of old Gumbo, the child’s father, who found his
young master so engaged, and to the indignation of Madam
Esmond, who ordered the young negro off to the proper
oﬂicer for a‘ whipping. In vain George implored and en-
treated-——burst into passionate tears, and besought a remis-
sion of the sentence. His mother was inﬂexible regarding
the young rebel’s punishment, and the little negro went off
beseeching his young master not to cry.

13. On account of a certain apish drollery and humor
which exhibited itself in the lad, and a liking for some of
the old man’s pursuits, the ﬁrst of the twins was the grand-
father’s favorite and companion, and would laugh and talk
out all his infantine heart to the old gentleman, to whom
the younger had seldom a word to say.

14. George was a demure, studious boy, and his senses
seemed to brighten up in the library, where his brother was
so gloomy. He knew the books before he could well-nigh
carry them, and read in them long before he could under-
stand them. Harry, on the other hand, was all alive in

down as if glad to be rid of their burden. All who read
and heard that discourse, wondered where Parson Broad-

which adorned it. Perhaps Mr. Dempster knew, the boys’
Scotch tutor, who corrected the proofs of the oration, which
was printed, by the desire of his Excellency and many
persons of honor, at Mr. Franklin’s press in Philadelphia.

Esmond’s step-son, the Lord Castlewood of Hampshire in
England, asked to be at the charges of the marble slab
which recorded the names and virtues of his lordship’s
mother and her husband; and after due time of prepara-
tion, the monument was set up, exhibiting the arms and
coronet of the Esmonds, supported by a little, chubby group
of weeping cherubs, and reciting an epitaph which for once
did not tell any falsehoods.

America in 1852. He has contributed a number of tales and poems to

form. Mr. O’Brien belonged to the New York Seventh Regiment, and
died at Baltimore of a wound received in a cavalry skirmish.‘

The white clouds scud before the storm;
And naked in the howling night
The red-eyed light-house lifts its form.

The massive tower, and climb and fall,
And, muttering, growl with baﬂied rage
Their curses on the sturdy wall.

2. Up in the lonely tower he sits,
The keeper of the crimson light:
Silent and awe-struck does he hear
The imprecations of the night.

And seeks a shelter anywhere.

3. He prays aloud, the lonely man,

For every soul that night at sea,

But more than all for that brave boy
Who used to gayly climb his knee,———

Young Charlie, with his chestnut hair,
And hazel eyes, and laughing lip.

“May Heaven look down,” the old man cries,

“Upon my son, and on his ship!”

4. While thus with pious heart he prays,
Far in the distance sounds a boom:
,He pauses; and again there rings
That sullen thunder through the room.
A ship upon the shoals to-night!
She can not hold for one half-hour;
But clear the ropes and grappling-hooks,
And trust in the Almighty Power!

5. On the drenched gallery he stands,
Striving to pierce the solid night:
Across the sea the red eye throws
A steady crimson wake of light;
And, where it falls upon the waves,
He sees a human head ﬂoat by,
With long drenched curls of chestnut hair,
And wild but fearless hazel eye.

6. Out with the hooks! One mighty ﬂing!
Adown the wind the long rope curls.
Oh! will it catch? Ah, dread suspense!
While the Wild ocean wilder whirls.

Oh! his old heart will burst with joy,
As on the slippery rocks he pulls
The breathing body of his boy.

faults in elocution. One very important instrument for giving expres-
sion and life to thought is thus lost, and the hearer soon becomes Wearied
and disgusted.

REMARK 2.—There is another fault of nearly equal magnitude, and of
very frequent occurrence. This consists in varying the pitch and force
without reference to the sense. A sentence is commenced with vehemence
and in a high key, and the voice gradually sinks until, the breath being
spent, it dies away in a whisper.

No'rE.—The power of changing the key at will is difficult to acquire,
but of great importance.

REMARK 3.—The habit of sing-song, so common in reading poetry, as it
is a variation of pitch without reference to the sense, is a species of the
fault above mentioned.

REMARK 4.—If the reader or speaker is guided by the sense, and if he
gives that emphasis, inﬁection, and expression required by the meaning,
these faults speedily disappear.

REMARK 5.-—To improve the voice in these respects, practice is neces-
sary. Commence, for example, with the lowest pitch the voice can com-
fortably sound, and repeat whole paragraphs and pages upon that key
with gentle force. Then repeat the paragraph with increased force, tak-
ing care not to raise the pitch. Then rise one note higher, and practice
on that, then another, and so on, until the highest pitch of the voice is
reached. Reverse the process, and repeat as before until the lowest pitch
is obtained.

NOTE.—In these and all similar exercises, be very careful not to con-
found pitch and force.

QUANTITY AND QUALITY.

The tones of the voice should vary also in quantity, or
time required to utter a sound or a syllable, and in quality,
or expression, according to the nature of the subject.

REMARK.—We notice a diﬁerence between the soft, insinuating tones
of persuasion; the full, strong voice of command and decision; the
harsh, irregular, and sometimes grating explosion of the sounds of
passion; the plaintive notes of sorrow and pity; and the equable and
unimpassioned ﬂow of words in argumentative style.

The following direction, therefore, is Worthy of attention.

The tones of the voice should always correspond both‘ in
quantity and quality with the nature of the subject.

CIX. HAMLET.

William Shakespeare (b. 1564, d. 1616), by many regarded as the
greatest poet the World has ever produced, was born at Stratford-upon-
Avon, England. He was married, when very young, to a woman eight

years his senior, Went to London, was joint proprietor of B1ackfriar’s ‘

Theater in 1589, wrote poems and plays, was an actor, accumulated.
some property, and retired to Stratford three or four years before his
death. He was buried in Stratford church, Where a monument has
been erected to his memory. This is all that is known of him with
any degree of certainty. .

Shakespeare’s Works consist chieﬂy of plays and sonnets. They
show a Wonderful knowledge of human nature, expressed in language
remarkable for its point and beauty.

But even then the morning cock crew loud,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And vanish’d from our sight.

CX. DISSERTATION ON ROAST PIG.

Charles‘ Lamb (b. 1775, cl. 1834) was born in London. He was educated
at Christ’s Hospital, where he was a school-fellow and intimate friend of
Coleridge. In 1792 he became a clerk in the India House, London, and in
1825 he retired from his clerkship on a pension of £441. Lamb never mar-
ried, but devoted his life to the care of his sister Mary, who was at times
insane. He Wrote “ Tales founded on the Plays of Shakespeare,” and
several other Works of rare merit; but his literary fame rests principally
on the inimitable “ Essays of Elia ” (published originally in the “ London
Magazine ”), from one of which the following selection is adapted.

1. ’MANKIND, says a Chinese ‘manuscript, which my
friend M. was obliging enough to read and explain to me,
for the ﬁrst seventy thousand ages ate their meat raw,
clawing or biting it from the living animal, just as they
do in Abyssinia to this day.

334 E CLECTI 0 SERIES.

2. This period is not obscurely hinted at by their great
Confucius in the second chapter of his “ Mundane Muta-
tions,” where he designates a kind of golden age by the
term Cho-fang, literally the Cooks’ Holiday. The manu-
script goes on to say that the art of roasting, or rather
broiling (which I take to be the elder brother), was acci-
dentally discovered in the manner following:

3. The swine-herd, Ho-ti, having gone out into the wpods
one morning, as his manner was, to collect mast for his
hogs, left his cottage in the care of his eldest son, Bo-bo, a
great lubberly boy, who, being fond of playing with ﬁre,
as younkers of his age commonly are, let some sparks
escape into a bundle of straw, which, kindling quickly,
spread the conﬂagration over every part of their poor man-
sion till it was reduced to ashes.

4. Together with the cottage,—a sorry, antediluvian
make-shift of a building, you may think it,———what was of
much more importance, a ﬁne litter of new-born pigs, no
less than nine in number, perished. China pigs have been
esteemed a luxury all over the East from the remotest
periods we read of.

5. Bo-bo was in the utmost consternation, as you may
think, not so much for the sake of the tenement, which his
father and he could easily build up again with a few dry
branches, and the labor of an hour or two, at any time, as
for the loss of the pigs. While he was thinking what he
should say to his father, and wringing his hands over the
smoking remnants of one of those untimely sufferers, an
odor assailed his nostrils unlike any scent which he had be-
fore experienced.

6. What‘ could it proceed from? Not from the burnt
cottage,—he had smelt that smell before,—indeed, this was
by no means the ﬁrst accident of the kind which had oc-
curred through the negligence of thisunlucky young ﬁre-
brand. Much less did it resemble that of any known herb,
Weed, or ﬂower. A premonitory moistening at the same

FIFTH READER. 335

time overﬂowed his nether lip. He knew not what to
think.

7. He next stooped down to feel the pig, if there were
any signs of life in it. He burnt his ﬁngers, and to cool
them he applied them in his booby fashion to his mouth.
Some of the crumbs of the scorched skin had come away
with his ﬁngers, and for the ﬁrst time in his life (in the

. world’s life, indeed, for before him no man had known it) .

he tasted—crackl'£ng! Again he felt and fumbled at the
pig. It did not burn him so much now; still he licked his
ﬁngers from a sort of habit.

8. The truth at length broke into his slow understanding
that it was the pig that smelt so, and the pig that tasted
so delicious; and surrendering himself up to the new-born
pleasure, he fell to tearing up whole handfuls of the
scorched skin with the ﬂesh next it, and was cramming it
down his throat in his beastly fashion, when his sire entered
amid the smoking rafters, armed with a retributory cudgel,
and, ﬁnding how affairs stood, began to rain blows upon
the young rogue’s shoulders as thick as hailstones, which
Bo-bo heeded not any more than if they had been ﬂies.

9. His father might lay on, but he could not beat him
from his pig till he had fairly made an end of it, when,
becoming a little more sensible of his situation, something
like the following dialogue ensued:

H “You graceless Whelp, what have you got there devour-
ing? Is it not enough that you have burnt me down three

, houses with your dog’s tricks, and be hanged to you! but

you must be eating ﬁre, and I know not what? What
have you got there, I say?”

“O father, the pig, the pig! do come and taste how
nice the burnt pig eats!”

10. The ears of Ho-ti tingled with horror. He cursed
his son, and he cursed himself that he should ever have a
son that should eat burnt pig.

Bo-bo, whose scent was wonderfully sharpened since

336 E OLE OTI 0’ SERIES.

morning, soon raked out another pig, and, fairly rending it

asunder, thrust the lesser half by main force into the ﬁsts‘

of Ho-ti, still shouting out, “Eat, eat, eat the burnt pig,
father! only taste! Oh!” with such like barbarous ejacu-
lations, cramming all the while as if he would choke.

11. Ho-ti trembled in every joint while he grasped the
abominable thing, wavering whether he should not put his
son to death for an unnatural young monster, when the
crackling scorching his ﬁngers, as it had done his son’s,
and applying the same remedy to them, he in his turn
tasted some of its ﬂavor, which, make what sour mouths he
would for a pretense, proved not altogether displeasing to
him." In conclusion (for the manuscript here is a little
tedious), both father and son fairly sat down to the mess,
and never left off till they had dispatched all that remained
of the litter.’

12. Bo-bo was strictly enjoined not to let the secret es-
cape, for the neighbors would certainly have stoned them
for a-couple of abo_1_nj_pable wretch_es, who could think of
improving upon the good meat which God had sent them.
Nevertheless strange stories got about. It was observed
that Hoti’s cottage was burnt down now more frequently
than ever. Nothing but ﬁres from this time forward.
Some would break out in broad day, others in the night
time; and Ho-ti himself, which was the more remarkable,
instead of chastising his son, seemed to grow more indul-
gent to him than ever.

13. At length they were watched, the terrible mystery
discovered, and father and son summoned to take their
trial at Pekin, then an inconsiderable aﬁﬁize town. Evi-
dence was given, the obnoxious food itself produced in
court, and verdict about to be pronounced, when the fore-
man of the jury begged that some of the burnt pig, of
which the culprits stood accused, might be handed into the
box. ’

14. He handled it, and they all handled it; and burning

their ﬁngers, as Bo-bo and his father had done before them,
and nature prompting to each of them the same remedy,
against the face of all the facts, and the clearest charge
which the judge had ever given,——to the surprise of the
whole court, towns-folk, strangers, reporters, and all pres-
ent,—without leaving the box, or any manner of consulta-
tion whatever, they brought in a simgltaneous verdict of

“Not Guilty.” .
15. The judge, who was a s rewd fellow, winked at the

manifest iniquity of the dec__i_§_ion; and when‘ the court was
dismissed, went privily, and bought up all the pigs that
could be had for love or money. 1 In a few days his lord-
ship’s town-house was observed to be on ﬁre.

16. The thing took wing, and now there was nothing to
be seen but ﬁre in every direction. Fuel and pigs grew
enormously dear all over the district. The insurance
oﬂices one and all shut ‘up shop. People built slighter and
slighter every day, until it was feared that the very Science
of architecture would in no long time be lost to thefworld.

17. Thus this custom of ﬁring houses continued till in
process of time, says my manuscript, a sage arose, like our
Locke, who made a discovery that the ﬂesh of swine, or
indeed of any other animal, might be cooked (burnt, as they
called it) without the necessity of consuming a whole house

' to dress it.

ing by the string or spit ‘came in a century or two later; I

the manuscript, do the most useful, and seemingly the
most obvious, arts make their way among mankind.

19. Without placing too implicit faith in the account‘

above given, it must‘ be agreed that if a worthy pretext. for
so dangerous an experiment as setting houses on ﬁre (es-
pecially in these days) could be assigned in favor of any
‘..linary object that prpgatext and excuse might be found in

while overhead, in the pale yellow of the sky, some ﬁlmy
clouds of rose color lay motionless. How calm was the
sea out there, and the whiter stretch of water coming into

; Loch Roag! The cool air of the twilight was scented with

sweet-brier. The wash of the ripples along the coast could
be heard in- the stillness.
4. The girl put her hand on her father’s head, and re-

minded him that she had had her big greyhound, Bras, -

imprisoned all the afternoon, and that she had to go down
to Borvabost with a message for some people who were
leaving by the boat in the morning.

“ But you can not go away down to Borvabost by your-'

self, Sheila,” said Ingram. “It will be dark before you
return.”

“It will not be darker than this all the night through,”
said the girl.

5. “But I hope you will let us go with you,” said

Lavender, rather anxiously; and she assented with a. gra-

cious smile, and went to fetch the great deer-hound, that
was her constant companion. And lo! he found himself

walking with a Princess in this wonder-land, through the
magic twilight that prevails in northern latitudes. Mac-
kenzie and Ingram had gone to the front. The large
deer-hound, after regarding him attentively, had gone to
its mistress’s side, and remained closely there.

6. Even Sheila, when they had reached the loftiest
part of their route, and could see beneath them the island
and the water surrounding it, was struck by the exceeding
beauty of the twilight; and as for her companion, he re-
membered it many a time thereafter, as if it were a dream
of the sea.

7. Before them lay the Atlantic—a pale line of blue,
still, silent, .and remote. Overhead the sky was of a clear,
thin gold, with heavy masses of violet cloud stretched
across from north to south, and thickening as they got
near the horizon. Down at their feet, near the shore, a
dusky line of huts and houses was scarcely visible; and
over these lay a pale blue ﬁlm of peat-smoke that did not
move in the still air.

8. Then they saw the bay into which the White Water
runs, and they could trace the yellow glimmer of the river
stretching into the island through a level valley of bog and
morass. Far away towards the east lay the bulk of the
island, ——dark green undulations of moorland and pasture;
and there, in the darkness, the gable of one white house
had caught the clear light of the sky, and was gleaming
westward like a star.

9. But all this was as nothing to the glory that began
to shine in the southeast, where the sky was of a pale violet
over the peaks of Mealasabhal and Suainabhal. There,
into the beautiful dome, rose the golden crescent of the
moon, warm in color, as though it still retained the last rays
of the sunset. A line of quivering gold fell across Loch
Roag, and touched the black hull and spars of the boat in
which Sheila had been sailing in the morning.

10. That bay down there, with its white sands and mass-

ive rocks, its still expanse of water, and its background of
mountain-peaks palely covered by the yellow moonlight,
seemed really a home for a magic princess who was shut
off from all the world. But here, in front of them, was
another sort of sea, and another sort of life,—a_ small ﬁsh-
ing-village hidden under a cloud of pale peat-smoke, and
fronting the great waters of the Atlantic itself, which lay
under a gloom of violet clouds. .

11. On the way home it was again Lavender’s good
fortune to walk with Sheila across the moorland path they

had traversed‘ some little time before. And now the moon

was still higher in the heavens, and the yellow lane of light
that crossed the violet waters of Loch Roag quivered in a
deeper gold. The night air was scented with the Dutch
clover growing down by the shore. They could hear the
curlew whistling and the plover calling amid that monoto-
nous plash of the waves that murmured all around the coast.
V 12. When they returned to the house, the darker waters
of the Atlantic and the purple clouds of the west were shut
out from sight; and before them there was only the liquid
plain of Loch Roag, with its pathway of yellow ﬁre, and
far away on the other side the shoulders and peaks of the

southern mountains, that had grown gray and clear and L

sharp in the beautiful twilight. And this was Sheila’s
home. 2 L

CXII. THE GREAT VOICES.

Charles T. Brooks (b. 1813, d. 1883) was born at Salem, Mass., and was
the Valedictorian of his class at Harvard College, where he graduated in
1832. He shortly afterwards entered the ministry, and had charge of a
congregation at Newport, R. 1. He was a great student of German liter-
ature, and began his own literary career by a translation of Schil1er’s
“ William Tell.” This was followed by numerous translations from the
German, mainly poetry, which have been published from time to time, in
several volumes. Of these translations, Goethe’s “ Faust,” Richter’s
“Titan” and “Hesperus,” and a humorous poem by Dr.'Kar1 Arnold
Kortum, “ The Life, Opinions, Actions, and Fate of Hieronimus Jobs, the
Candidate,” deserve especial mention. Mr. Brooks also published a
number of original poems, addresses, etc.

From the mountains again to the sea;

A call from the deep to the fountains,—

2. A cry from the ﬂoods to the fountains;
And the torrents repeat the glad song
As they leap from the breast of the mountains,-
“O spirit! be free and be strong.”

3. The pine forests thrill with emotion
Of praise, as the spirit sweeps by:
With a voice like the murmur of ocean
To the soul of the listener they cry.

4. Oh! sing, human heart, like the fountains,
With joy reverential and free,
Contented and calm as the mountains,
And deep as the woods and the sea.

CXIII. A PICTURE OF HUMAN LIFE.

Samuel Johnson (b. 1709, d. 1784). This remarkable man was born
in Lichﬁeld, Staffordshire, England. He was the son of a book-seller
and stationer- He entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1728; but his
poverty compelled him to leave at the end of three years. ‘Soon after
his marriage, in 1736, he opened a private school, but obtained only
three pupils, one of whom was David Garrick, afterwards a celebrated
actor. In 1737, he removed to London, where he resided most of the
rest of his life. The most noted of his numerous literary Works are his
“ Dictionary,” the ﬁrst one of the English language worthy of mention,
“The Vanity of Human Wishes,” a poem, “The Rambler,” “ Rasselas,”
“The Lives of the English Poets,” and his edition of Shakespeare. An
annual pension of £300 was\granted him in 1762.

In person, Johnson Was heavy a11d aWkWard;.in manner, boorish
and overbearing; but his learning and his great powers caused his
company to be sought by many eminent men. - - A

1. OBIDAH, the son of Abensina, left the caravansary
early in the morning, and pursued his journey ‘through
the plains of Hindoostan. He was fresh and vigorous with
rest; he was animated with hope; he was incited by de-
sire; he walked swiftly forward over the valleys, and saw
the hills gradually rising before him.

2. As he passed along, his ears were delighted with the
morning song of the bird-of-paradise; he was fanned by
the last ﬂutters of the sinking breeze, and sprinkled with
dew by groves of spices; he sometimes contemplated the

344 t EOLEOTIO SERIES’;

towering height of the oak, monarch of the hills; and
sometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the primrose,
eldest daughter of the spring; all his senses were gratiﬁed,
and all care was banished from his heart.

3. Thus he went on, till the sun approached his merid-
ian, and the increasing heatpreyed upon his strength; he
then looked round about him for some more commodious
path. He saw, on his right hand, a grove that seemed to
wave its shades as a sign of invitation; he entered it, and
found the coolness and verdure irresistibly pleasant. He
did not, however, forget whither he was traveling, but
found a narrow way, bordered with ﬂowers, which ap-
peared to have the same direction with the main road,
and was pleased, that, by this happy experiment, he had
found means to unite pleasure with business, and to gain
the rewards of diligence without suffering its fatigues.

4. He, therefore, still continued to walk for a time,‘

without the least remission of his ardor, except that he

was sometimes tempted to stop by the music of the birds,

which the heat had assembled in the shade, and sometimes

amused himself with picking the ﬂowers that covered the
banks on each side, or the fruits that hung upon the
branches. At last, the green path began to decline from
its ﬁrst tendency, and to wind among the hills and thick-
ets, cooled with fountains, and murmuring with water-
falls. ‘

5. Here Obidah paused for a time, and began to con-
sider whether it was longer safe to forsake the known and
common track; but, remembering that the heat’ was now
in its greatest violence, and that the plain was dusty and
uneven, he resolved to pursue the new path, which he
supposed only to make a few meanders, in compliance with
the varieties of   the ground, and to end at last in the
common road. '

6. Having thus calmed his solicitude, he renewed his
pace, though he suspected he was not gaining ground.

FIFTH READER. M 345

This uneasiness of his mind inclined him to lay hold on
every new object, and give way to every sensation that
might soothe or divert him. He listened to every echo,
he mounted every bill for a fresh prospect, he turned
aside to every cascade, and pleased himself with tracing
the course of a gentle river that rolled among the trees,
and watered a large region, with innumerable circumvolu-
tions.

7. In these amusements, the hours passed away un-
counted; his deviations had perplexed his memory, and he
knew not toward what point to travel. "He stood pensive
and confused, afraid to go forward lest he should go wrong,
yet conscious that the time of loitering was now past.
iWhile he was thus tortured with uncertainty, the sky was

overspread with clouds, the day vanished from before him,
and a sudden tempest gathered round his head.

8. He was now roused by his danger to a quick and
painful remembrance of his folly; he now saw how happi-
ness is lost when ease is consulted; he lamented the un-
manly impatience that prompted him to seek shelter in the
grove, and despised the petty curiosity that led him on
from triﬂe to triﬂe. While he was thus reﬂecting, the air

 blacker and a clap of thunder broke his meditation.
 now resolved to do what remained yet in his
power; to tread back the ground which he had passed,
and try to ﬁnd some issue where the wood might open into
the plain. He pros_._t_1:ated himself upon the ground, and
commended his life to the Lord of nature. He rose with
conﬁdence and tranquillity, and pressed on with his saber
in his hand; for the beasts of the desert were in motion,
and on every hand were heard the mingled howls of rage,
and fear, and ravage, and expiration; all the horrors of
darkness and solitude surrounded him; the winds roared in
the woods, and the torrents tumbled. from the hills.

10. Thus, forlorn and distressed, he wandered through

the wild without knowing whither he was going or Whether

346 ECLEOTIO SERIES.

he was every moment drawing nearer to safety or to de-
struction. At length, not fear but labor began to over-
come him; his breath grew short, and his knees trembled,
and he was on the point of lying down, in resignation to
his fate, when he beheld, through the brambles, the glim-
mer of a taper. He advanced toward the light, and ﬁnd-
ing that it proceeded from the cottage of a hermit, he
called humbly at the door, and obtained admission. The
old man set before him such provisions as he had collected
for himself, on which Obidah fed with eagerness and grat-
itude. ' i i

11. When the repast was over, “Tell me,” said the
hermit, “by what chance thou hast been brought hither;
I have been now twenty years an inhabitant of this wilder-

ness, in which I never saw a man before.” Obidah then

related the occgrrences of his journey, without any conceal-
ment or palliation.

12. “Son,” said the hermit, “let the errors and follies,
the dangers and escapes, of this day, sink deep into your
heart. Remember, my son, that human life is the journey
of a day. VVe rise in the morning of youth, full of vigor,
and full of expectation; we set forward with spirit and
hope, with gayety and with diligence, and travel on awhile
in the straight road of pi_e_ty toward the mansions of rest.
In a short time we remit our fervor, and endeavor to ﬁnd
some mitigation of our duty, and some more easy means of
obtaining the same end. v

13. “We then relax our vigor, and resolve no longer to

, be terriﬁed with crimes at a distance, but rely upon our
own constancy, and venture to approach what we resolve ,

never to touch. VVe thus enter the bowers of ease, and re-
pose in the shades of security. Here the heart softens,
and vigilance subsides; we are then willing to inquire
whether another advance can not be made, and whether we
may not at least turn our eyes upon the gardens of pleas-
ure. We approach them with scruple and hesitation; We

enter them, but enter timorous and trembling, and always
hope to pass through. them without losing the road of
virtue, which we for awhile keep in our sight, and to

« which we propose to return.

14. “ But temptation succeeds temptation, and one com-
pliance prepares us for another; we, in time, lose the hap-
piness of innocence, and solace our disquiet with sensual

gratiﬁcations. By degrees we let fall the remembrance of ,

our original intention, and quit the only adequate object of
rational desire. We entangle ourselves in business, im-
merge ourselves in luxury, and rove through the labyrinths
of incQ1_sj:ancy till the darkness of old age begins to invade
us, and disease and ‘anxiety obstruct our way. We then
look back upon our lives with horror, with sorrow, and
with repentance; and wish, but too often vainly wish, that
we had not forsaken the paths of virtue.

15. “ Happy are they, my son, who shall learn, from
thy example, not to despair, but shall remember that
though the day is past, and their strength is wasted‘, there
yet remains one effort to be made; that refo_r_r_n_ation is
never hopeless, nor sincere endeavors ever unassisted; that
the wanderer may at length return after all his errors;
and that he who implores strength and courage from above,
shall ﬁnd danger and difficulty give way before him. Go
now, my son, to thy repose: commit thyself to the care of
Omnipo/tence; and when the morning calls again to toil,

ibegindiahew thy journey and thy life.”

VII. POETIC PAUSES.

In poetry we have, in addition to other pauses, poetic
pauses. The object of these is simply to promote the
melody.

At the end of each line a slight pause is proper, what-
ever be the grammatical construction or the sense. The

purpose of this pause is to make prominent the melody of T

the measure, and in rhyme to allow the ear to appreciate
the harmony of the similar sounds.

There is, also, another important pause, somewhere near
the middle of each li11e, which is called the cccsum or ca9su-
ml pause. In the following lines it is marked thus (H).

EXAMPLES.

There are hours long departedllwhich memory brings,
Like blossoms of Edenllto twine round the heart,

And as time rushes byllon the might of his wings,
They may darken awhile||but they never depart.

REMARK.-—The caesural pause should never be so placed as to injure the
sense. The following lines, if melody alone were consulted, would be
read thus:

With fruitless lallbor Clara bound,

And strove to stanchllthe gushing wound;
The Monk with unllavailing cares,
Exhausted all|| the church’s prayers.

This manner of reading, however, would very much interfere with the
proper expression of the idea. This is to be corrected by making the
caesural pause yield to the sense. The above lines should be read thus:

With fruitless 1aborH Clara bound,
And strove]! to stanch the gushing wound;
The Monk||with unavailing cares,

Exhaustedll all the church’s prayers.

-CXIV. A SUMMER LONGING-.

George Arnold (b. 1834, d. 1865) was born in New York, but removed
with his parents to Illinois while yet an infant. There he passed his
boyhood, being educated at home by his parents. In 1849 the family
again removed to Strawberry Farms, Monmouth County, New Jersey.
When eighteen years old he began to study painting, but soon gave up
the art and devoted himself to literature. He became a journalist of
New York City, and his productions include almost every variety of
Writings found in the literary magazines. After his death, two volumes
of his poems, “Drift: a Sea-shore Idyl,” and “Poems, Grave and Gay,”
were edited by Mr. William Winter. ’

1. I MUST away to the wooded hills and Vales,
Where broad, slow streams ﬂow cool and silently
And idle barges ﬂap their listless sails.
For. me the summer sunset glows and pales, ~
And green ﬁelds wait for me.

2. I long for shadowy founts, where the birds
Twitter and chirp at noon from every tree;
I long for blossomed leaves and lowing’ herds;
And Nature’s voices say in mystic words,
“ The green ﬁelds Wait for thee.”

3. I dream of uplands, where the primrose shines
‘AAnd waves her yellow lamps above the lea;
Of tangled copses, swung with trailing vines;
Of open vistas, skirted with tall pines,
Where green ﬁelds wait for me.

4. I think of long, sweet afternoons, when I
May lie and listen to the distant sea,
Or hear the breezes in the reeds that sigh,
Or insect Voices chirping shrill and dry,
In ﬁelds that wait for me.

seventeen years old he went to California, where he engaged in various
employments. He was a teacher, was employed in government oﬂices,
worked in the gold mines, and learned to be a compositor in a printing
office. In 1868 he started the “ Overland Monthly,” and his original and
characteristic poems and sketches soon made it a popular magazine. Mr.
Harte has been a contributor to some of the leading periodicals of the
country, but principally to the “Atlantic Monthly.”

“ THE sky is clouded, the rocks are bare;
The spray of the tempest is white in air;
The winds are out with the waves at play,
And I shall not tempt the sea to-day.

The panther clings to the arching limb;
And the lion’s whelps are abroad at play,
And I shall not join in the chase to-day.”

But the ship sailed safely over the sea,

And the hunters came from the chase in glee;
And the town that was builded upon a rock
Was swallowed up in the earthquake shock.

CXVI. THE BIBLE THE BEST OF CLASSICS.

Thomas S. Grimké (b. 1786, d. 1834). This eminent lawyer and scholar

Was born in Charleston, S. C. He graduated at Yale College in 1807. He

gained considerable reputation as a politician, but is best known as an
advocate of peace, Sunday-schools, and the Bible. He was a man of deep
feeling, earnest purpose, and pure life.

1. THERE is a classic, the best the world has ever seen,
the noblest that has ever, honored and digniﬁed the lan-
guage of mortals. If We look into its antiquity, we dis-
cover a title to our veneration unrivaled in the history of
literature. If We have respect to its evidences, they are
found in the testimony’ of miracle and prophecy; in the
ministry of man, of nature, and of angels, yea, even of
“ God,’ manifest in the ﬂesh,” of “God blessed forever.”

2. If We consider its authenticity, no other pages have
survived the lapse of time that can be compared with it.

, If We examine its authority, for it speaks as never man

spake, We discover that it came from heaven in vision and
prophecy under the sanction of Him who is Creator of all
things, and the Giver of every good and perfect gift.

3. If we reﬂect on its truths, they are lovely and spot-
less, sublime and holy as God himself, unchangeable as his
nature, durable as his righteous dominion, and versatile as
the moral condition of mankind. If We regard the value
of its treasures, We must estimate them, not like the relics
of classic antiquity, by the perishable glory and beauty,
virtue and happiness, of this World, but by the enduring
perfection and supreme felicity of an eternal kingdom.

4. If We inquire who are the men that have recorded its
truths, vindicated its rights, and illustrated the excellence
of its scheme, from the depth of ages and from the living
World, from the populous continent and the isles of the sea,
comes forth the answer: “The patriarch and the prophet,
the evangelist and the martyr.”

5. If we look abroad through the World of men, the
victims of folly or vice, the prey of cruelty, of injustice,

FIFTII READER. 351

and inquire what are its beneﬁts, even in this temporal
state, the great and the humble, the rich and the poor,
the powerful and the weak, the learned and the ignorant
reply, as with one voice, that humility and resignation,
purity, order, and peace, faith, hope, and charity are its
blessings upon earth.

6. And if, raising our eyes from time to eternity; from

the world of mortals to the world of just men made per- ‘

feet; from the visible creation, marvelous, beautiful, and
glorious as it is, to the invisible creation of angels and
seraphs; from the footstool of God to the throne of God
himself, we ask, what are the blessings that ﬂow from this
single volume, let the question be answered by the pen of
the evangelist, the harp of the prophet, and the records of
the book of life. ‘

7. Such is the best of classics the world has ever ad-
mired; such, the noblest that man has ever adopted as a
guide.

George P. Morris (b. 1802, d. 1864) was born in Philadelphia. In 1823 he

paper. In 1846 Mr. Morris and N. P. Willis founded “ The Home Jour-
nal.” He was associate editor of this popular journal until a short time
before his death. ‘

I. DEATH OF FRANKLIN.

(To be read in a solemn tone.)

Fran/clin is % The genius who freed America’, and
poured a copious stream of knowledge throughout Europe’, is
returned unto the bosom of the Divinity‘. The sage to whom
two worlds’ lay claim, the man for whom science’ and politics’
are disputing, indisputably enjoyed an elevated rank in human
nature.

The cabinets of princes have been long in the habit of noti-
fying the death of those who were great’, only in their funeral
orations‘. Long hath the etiquette of courts’, proclaimed the
mourning of hypocrisy‘. Nations’ should wear mourning for
none but their benefactors‘. The representatives’ of nations
should recommend to public homage’ only those who have been
the heroes of humanity‘. /

11. BONAPARTE.

He knew no motive’ but interest‘; acknowledged no criterion’
butsuccess‘; he worshiped no God’ but ambition‘; and with an
eastern devotion’, he knelt at the shrine of his idolatry‘. Sub-
sidiary to this, there was no creed’ that he did not profess‘,
there was no opinion’ that he did not promulgate‘: in the hope of
a dynasty’, he upheld the crescent‘; for the sake of a divorce’, he
bowed be§ore the cross‘; the orphan of St. Louis’, he became the
adopted child of the republic‘; and, with a parricidal ingrati-
tude’, on the ruins both of the throne and the tribune,he reared

III. HAMLET ON SEEING THE SKULL OF YORICK.

IV. DESCRIPTION OF A BATTLE.

Yet still Lord Marmion’s falcon ﬂew’
With wavering ﬂight‘, While ﬁercen grew
Around, the battle yell.
The border slogan rent the sky‘,
A Home‘.' a Gordon‘! was the cry‘;
Loud’ were the clanging blows‘;
Advanced’,—forced back‘,—now low’,—now high‘,
The pennon sunk’—and rose‘;
As bends the bark’s mast in the gale’,
When rent are rigging‘, shrouds‘, and sail’,
It wavered ’mid the foes‘.
The war, that for a space did fail’,
Now trebly thundering swelled the gale‘,
And Stanley‘! was the cry;
A light on Marmion’s visage spread’,
And ﬁred his glazing eye‘:——
With dying hand’, above his head’,
He shook the fragment of his blade’,
And shouted’ ,—“ Wctory‘!
C’/Large‘, Chester’, change‘! On‘, Stanley’, on‘!”—-
Were the last words of Marmion. _

V. LORD ULLIN’S DAUGHTER.

For the inﬂections and emphasis in this selection, let the pupil be
guided by his own judgment.

A chieftain to the Highlands bound,
Cries, “Boatman, do not tarry!

And I’ll give thee a silver pound,
To row us o’er the ferry.”

“Now, who be ye would cross Loch—Gyle
This dark and stormy water?”

“ Oh! I ’m the chief of Ulva’s isle,
And this, Lord Ullin’s daughter.

“And fast before her father’s men
Three days we’ve ﬂed together,’
For should he ﬁnd us in the glen,
My blood would stain the heather.

“His horsemen hard behind us ride;
Should they our steps discover,
Then who will cheer my bonny bride,
VVhen they have slain her lover?”

Out spoke the hardy Highland Wight
“I’ll go, my chief—I’m ready:

It is not for your silver bright,
But for your Winsome lady:

And, by my word! the bonny bird
In danger shall not tarry;

So, though the waves are raging white,
I’ll row you o’er the ferry.”

By this, the storm grew loud apace,
The water-wraith was shrieking;

And, in the scowl of heaven, each face
Grew dark as they were speaking.

FIFTII READER. ' 37

But still, as Wilder grew the Wind,
And as the night grew drearer,

Adown the glen rode armed men,
Their trampling sounded nearer.

“Oh! haste thee, haste!” the lady cries,
“Though tempests round us gather,
I’ll meet the raging of the skies,
But not an angry father.”

The boat has left the stormy land,
A stormy sea before her;

When, oh! too strong for human hand,
The tempest gathered o’er her.

And still they rowed, amid the roar
Of Waters fast prevailing;

Lord Ullin reached that fatal shore,
His Wrath was changed to Wailing.

For sore dismayed through storm and shade
His child he did discover;

One lovely hand she stretched for aid,
And one Was round her lover.

“Come back! come back!” he cried, in grief,
“Across this stormy Water;
And I’ll forgive your Highland chief,
My daughter! 0, my daughter!”

’TWas vain: the loud waves lashed the shore,
Return or aid preventing:

The waters wild, Went o’er his child,
And he was left lamenting.

M‘? GU FFEY’S

I. THE GOOD READER.

1. IT is told of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia,
that, as he Was seated one day in his private room, a
Written petition Was brought to him with the request that

it should be immediately read. The King had just re-
(39)

40 E OLE O'T10' SERIES. _

turned from hunting, and the glare of the sun, or some
other cause, had so dazzled his eyes that he found it difIi-
cult to make out a single Word of the Writing.

2. His private secretary happened to be absent; and the
soldier who brought the petition could not read. There
was a page, or favorite boy-servant, waiting in the hall, and
upon him the King called. The page Was a son of one of
the noblemen of the court, but proved to be a very poor
reader.

3. In the ﬁrst place, he did not articulate distinctly.
He huddled his Words together in the utterance, as if they
were syllables of one l.ong Word, which he must get

through with as speedily as possible. His pronunciation

Was bad, and he did not modulate his voice so as to bring
out the meaning of What he read. Every sentence was
uttered with a dismal monotony of voice, as if it did not
differ in any respect from that which preceded it.

4. “Stop!” said the King, impatiently. “Is it an auc-
tioneer’s list of goods to be sold that you are hurrying

over‘? Send your companion to me.” Another page who

stood at the door now entered, and to him the King gave
the petition. The second page began by hemming and
clearing his throat in such an affected manner that the
King jokingly asked him if he had not slept in the public
garden, with the gate open, the night before.

5. The second page had a good share of self-conceit,
however, and so was not greatly confused by the King’s
jest. He determined that he would avoid the mistake
which his comrade had made. So he commenced reading
the petition slowly and With great formality, emphasizing
every Word, and prolonging the articulation of every sylla-
ble. But his manner was so tedious that the King cried
out, “Stop! are you reciting a lesson in the elementary
sounds? Out of the room! But no: stay! Send me that
little girl Who is sitting there by the fountain.”

6. The girl thus pointed out by the King was a daugh-

FIFTH READER. 41

ter of one of the laborers employed by the royal gardener;
and she had come to help her father weed the ﬂower-beds.
It chanced that, like many of the poor people in‘ Prussia,
she had received a good education. She was somewhat
alarmed when she found herself in the King’s presence, but
took courage when the King told her that he only wanted

K her to read for him, as his eyes were weak.
7. Now, Ernestine (for this was the name of the little .

girl) was fond of reading aloud, and often many of the
neighbors would assemble at her father’s house to hear her;
those who could not read themselves would come to her,
also, with their letters from distant friends or children, and
she thus formed the habit of reading various sorts of
hand-writing promptly and Well.

8. The King gave her the petition, and she rapidly
glanced through the openinglines to get some idea of what
it was about. As she read, her eyes began to glisten, and
her breast to heave. “What is the matter?” asked the
King; “don’t you know how to read?” “Oh, yes! sire,”
she replied, addressing him with the title usually applied
to him: “I will now read it, if you please.”

9. The two pages were about to leave the room. “ Re-
main,” said the King. The little girl began to read the
petition. It was from a poor widow, whose only son had
been drafted to serve in the army, although his health was
delicate and his pursuits had been such as to unﬁt him for
military life. His father had been killed in battle, and the

. son had a strong desire to become a portrait-painter.

10. The writer told her story in a simple, concise man-
ner, that carried to the heart a belief of its truth; and
Ernestine read it with so much feeling, and with an artic-
ulation so just, in tones so pure and distinct, that when
she had ﬁnished, the King, into whose eyes the tears had
started, exclaimed, “Oh! now I understand what it is all

T about; but I might never have known, certainly I never

should have felt, its meaning had I trusted to these young

42 EOLEOTIC SERIES.

gentlemen, whom I now dismiss from my service for one
year, advising them to occupy the time in learning to
read.”

11. “As for you, my young lady,” continued the King,
“I know you will ask no better reward for your trouble
than the pleasure of carrying to this poor widow my order
for her son’s immediate discharge. Let me see if you can
write as well as you can read. Take this pen, and write
as I dictate.” He then dictated a11 order, which Ernestine
wrote, and he signed. Calling one of his guards, he bade
him go with the girl and see that the order was obeyed.

12. How much happiness was Ernestine the means of
bestowing through her good elocution, united to the happy
circumstance that brought it to the knowledge of the
King! First, there were her poor neighbors, to whom she
could give instruction and entertainment. Then, there was
the poor widow who sent the petition, and who not only
regained her son, but received through Ernestine an order
for him to paint the King’s likeness; so that the poor boy
soon rose to great distinction, and had more orders than he
could attend to. VVords could not express his gratitude,
and that of his mother, to the little girl.

13. And Ernestine had, moreover, the satisfaction of aid-
ing her father to rise in the world, so that he became the
King’s chief gardener. The King did not forget her, but
had her well educated at his own expense. As for the two
pages, she was indirectly the means of doing them good,
also; for, ashamed of their bad reading, they commenced
studying in earnest, till they overcame the faults that had
offended the King. Both ﬁnally rose to distinction, one as
a lawyer, and the other as a statesman; and they owed
their ‘advancement in life chieﬂy to their good elocution.

‘ NOTES.-—Frederick II.of Prussia (b. 1712, d. 1786), or Frederick the
Great, as he was called, was one of the greatest of German rulers.
He was distinguished for his military exploits, for his wise and just
government, and for his literary attainments. He wrote many able

Works in the French language. Many pleasant anecdotes are told of‘

this king, of which the one given in the lesson is a fair sample.

II. THE BLUEBELL.

1. THERE is a story I have heard—
A poet learned it of ‘a bird,
And kept its music every Word—

2. A story of a dim ravine,
O’er which the towering tree-tops lean,
With one blue rift of sky between;

3. And there, two thousand years ago,
A little ﬂower as white as snow,
Swayed in the silence to and fro.

4. Day after day, with longing eye,
The ﬂoweret watched the narrow sky,
And ﬂeecy clouds that ﬂoated by.

5. And through the darkness, night by night,
One gleaming star would climb the height,
And cheer the lonely ﬂoWeret’s sight.

6. Thus, watching the blue heavens afar,
And the rising of its favorite star,
A slow change came—but not to mar;

44. EOLEOTIO SERIES.

7. For softly o’er its petals white
There crept a blueness, like the light
Of skies upon a summer night;

8. And in its chalice, I am told,
The bonny bell was formed to hold
A tiny star that gleamed like gold.

9. Now, little people, sweet and true,
I ﬁnd a lesson here for you,
Writ in the ﬂoweret’s bell of blue:’

Strives after all things pure and high,
Shall take their image by-and-by.

III. THE GENTLE HAND.

Timothy S. Arthur (b. 1809, d. 1885) was born near Newburgh, N. Y.,
but passed most of his life at Baltimore and Philadelphia. His oppor-
tunities for good schooling were quite limited, and he may be consid-
ered a self-educated man. He was the author of more than a hundred
Volumes, principally novels of a domestic and moral tone, and of many
shorter tales—magazine articles, etc. “Ten Nights in a Bar-Room,” and
“Three Years in aAMan-Trap,” are among his best known Works.

1. WHEN and where, it matters not now to relate—but
once upon a time, as I was passing through a thinly peo-
pled district of country, night came down upon me almost
unawares. Being on foot, I could not hope to gain the
village toward which my steps were directed until a

FIFTH READER. 45

late hour; and I therefore preferred seeking shelter and a
night’s lodging at the ﬁrst humble dwelling that presented
itself.

2. Dusky twilight was giving place to deeper shadows,
when I found myself in the vicinity of a dwelling, from
the small uncurtained windows of which the light shone
with a pleasant promise of good cheer and comfort. The

house stood within an enclosure, and a short distance from‘

the road along which I was moving with wearied feet.

3. Turning aside, and passing through the ill-hung gate,
I approached the dwelling. Slowly the gate swung on its
wooden hinges, and’ the rattle of its latch, in closing, did
not disturb the air until I had nearly reached the porch in
front of the house,in which a slender girl, who had noticed
my entrance, stood awaiting my arrival.

4. A deep, quick bark answered, almost like an echo,
the sound of the shutting gate, and, sudden as an appari-

tion, the form of an immense dog loomed in the doorway. ,

At the instant when he was about to spring, a light hand
was laid upon his shaggy neck, and a low word spoken.

5. “Go in, Tiger,” said the girl, not in a Voice of au-
thority, yet in her gentle tones was the consciousness that
she would be obeyed; and, as she spoke, she lightly bore
upon the animal with her hand, and he turned away and
disappeared within the dwelling.

6. “Who’s that?” A rough voice asked the question;
and now a heavy-looking man took the dog’s place in the

_ door.

7. “How far is it to G ?” I asked, not deeming it
best to say, in the beginning, that I sought a resting-place
for the night.

8. “To G I” growled the man, but not so harshly
as at ﬁrst. “It ’s good six miles from here.”

9. “A long distance; and I’m a stranger, and on foot,”

 

 

' said I. “If you can make room for me until morning, I

will be Very thankful.”

46 EOLEOTIO SERIES.

10. I saw the girl’s hand move quickly up his arm, until
it rested on his shoulder, and now she leaned to him still
closer.

3 11. “Come in. We ’ll try what can be done for you.”
There was a change in the man’s voice that made me
wonder. I entered a large room, in which blazed. a brisk
ﬁre. Before the ﬁre sat two stout lads, who turned upon
me their heavy eyes, with no very welcome greeting. 5A
middle—aged woman was standing at a table, and two chil-
dren were amusing themselves with a kitten on the ﬂoor.

12. “A stranger, mother,” said the man who had given
me so rude a greeting at the door; “and he wants us to
let him stay all night.”

13. The woman looked at me doubtingly for a few mo-
ments, and then replied coldly, “We don’t keep .a public
house.”

14. “I’m aware of that, ma’am,” said I; “but night
has overtaken me, and it ’s a long way yet to G .”

15. “Too far for a tired man to go on foot,” said the
master of the house, kindly, “ so it ’s no use talking about
it, mother; we must give him a bed.”

16. So unobtrusively that I scarce noticed the move-
ment, the girl had drawn to her mother’s side. What she
said to her I did 11ot hear, for the brief words were uttered
in a low voice; but I noticed, as she spoke, one small, fair
hand rested on the woman’s hand.

17. VVas there magic in that touch? The woman’s re-
pulsive aspect changed into one of kindly welcome, and
she said, “Yes, it ’s a long way to G I guess we can
ﬁnd a place for him.”

18. Many times more, during that evening, did I observe
the magic power of that hand and voice——the one gentle
yet potent as the other. On the next morning, breakfast
being over, I was preparing to take my departure when
my host informed me that if I would wait for half an
hour he would give me a ride in his wagon to G , as

 

FIFTH READER. 47

business required him to go there. I was very well pleased
to accept of the invitation.

19. In due time, the farmer’s wagon was driven into
the road before the house, and I was invited to get in. I
noticed the horse as a rough-looking Canadian pony, with a
certain air of stubborn endurance. As the farmer took his
seat by my side, the family came to the door to see us off.

20. “Dick!” said’ the farmer in a peremptory voice, «

giving the rein a quick jerk as he spoke. But Dick moved
not a step. “ Dick! you vagabond! get” up.” And the
farmer’s whip cracked sharply by the pony’s ear.

*21. It availed not, however, this second appeal. Dick
stood ﬁrmly disobedient. Next the whip was brought down
upon him with an impatient hand; but the pony only
reared up a little. Fast and sharp t-he_ strokes were next
dealt to the number of half-a-dozen. The man might as
well have beaten the wagon, for all his end was gained.

22. A stout lad now came out into the road, and, catch-
ing Dick by the bridle, jerked him forward, using, at the
same time, the customary language on such occasions, but
Dick met this new ally with increased stubbornness, plant-
ing his fore feet more ﬁrmly and at a sharper angle with
the ground.

23. The impatient boy now struck the pony on the side
of the head with his clenched hand, and jerked cruelly at
his bridle. It availed nothing, however; Dick was not to
be wrought upon by any such arguments.

24. “Don’t do so, John!” I turned my head as the

maiden’s sweet voice reached my ear. She was passing

through the gate into the road, and, in the next moment,
had taken hold of the lad and drawn him away from the
animal. N o strength was exerted in this; she took hold of
his arm, and he obeyed her wish as readily as if he had
no thought beyond her gratiﬁcation.

25. And now that soft hand was laid gently on the pony’s '

neck, and a single low word spoken. How instantly were

 

THE plan of the revision of MCGUEEEY’s FIFTH READER

is the same as that pursued in the other books of the

REVISED "SERIES. The book has been considerably en-
larged, but the new pieces have been added or substituted
only after the most careful consideration, and where the
advantages to be derived were assured.

It has been the object. to obtain as wide a range of lead-

ing authors as possible, to present the best specimens of T

style, to insure interest in the subjects, to impart valuable
information, and to exert a decided and healthful moral
inﬂuence. Thus the essential characteristics of MCGUFFEY’S
READERS have been carefully kept intact.

The preliminary exercises have been retained, and are
amply suﬂicient for drill in articulation, inﬂection, etc.
The additional exercises on these subjects, formerly inserted
between the lessons, have been omitted to make room for
other valuable features of the REVISED SERIES.

A full understanding of the text is necessary in order to
read it properly. As all the books of reference required
for this purpose are not Within the reach of the majority
of pupils, full explanatory notes have been given, Which,
it is believed, Will add greatly not only to the interest
of the reading lessons, but also to their usefulness from

an instructive point of view.

the tense muscles relaXed—how quickly the stubborn air
vanished.

26. “ Poor Dick!” said the maiden, as she stroked his
neck lightly, or softly patted it with a child-like hand.
“Now, go along, you provoking fellow!” she added, in a
half-chiding, yet affectionate voice, as she drew up the
bridle.

27. The pony turned toward her, and rubbed his head
against her arm for an instant or two; then, pricking up
his ears, he started off at a light, cheerful trot, and went on
his way as freely as if no silly crotchet had ever entered his
stubborn brain.

28. “What a wonderful power that hand possesses!”
said I, speaking to  companion, as we rode away.

1‘ 29. He looked at me for a moment, as if my remark had
occasioned surprise. Then a light came into his counte-
nance, and he said brieﬂy, “ She ’s good! Every body and
every thing loves her.” 2

30. Was that, indeed, the secret of her power? Was
the quality of her soul perceived in the impression of her
hand, even by brute beasts! The father’s explanation was

IV. THE GRANDFATHER.

Charles G-. Eastman (b. 1816. d. 1861) was born in Maine, but removed

at an early age to Vermont, where he was connected with the press at
Burlington, Woodstock and Montpelier. He published a Volume of
poems i11 1848, written in a happy lyric and ballad style, and faithfully
portraying rural life in New England.

THE farmer sat in his easy-chair
Smoking his pipe of clay,

While his hale old wife with busy care,
Was clearing the dinner away;

A sweet little girl with ﬁne blue eyes,

On her grandfather’s knee, was catching ﬂies.

. The old man laid his hand on her head,

With a tear on his wrinkled face,
He thought how often her mother, dead,
Had sat in the self-same place;
As the tear stole down from his half-shut eye,
“ Don’t smoke!” said the child, “ how it makes you cry!”

. The house-dog lay stretched out on the ﬂoor,

VVhere the shade, afternoons, used to steal;
The busy old wife by the open door

Was turning the spinning-wheel,
And the old brass clock on the mantel-tree
Had plodded along to almost three.

. Still the farmer sat in his easy-chair,

While close to his heaving breast,
The moistened brow and the cheek so fair
Of his sweet grandchild were pressed;
His head bent down, on her soft hair lay;
Fast /asleep were they both on that summer day.

V. A BOY ON A FARM.

Charles Dudley Warner (b. 1829, ) was born at Plainﬁeld, Mass.
In 1851 he graduated at Hamilton College, and in 1856 was admitted to
the bar at Philadelphia, but moved to Chicago to practice his profession.
There he remained until 1860, when he became connected with the Press
at Hartford, Conn., and has ever since devoted himself ‘to literature.
“My Summer in a Garden,” “ Saunterings,” and “Backlog Studies” are
his best known works. The following extract is from “Being a Boy.”

1. SAY what you will about the ge.u§_ral use__i'\1ilness of
boys, it is my impr ssion‘ that a farm without a boy would
Very soon come to grief. What the boy does is the life of

, the farm. He is the fac1;§%1m, always in degiand, always

exp, ted to do the thousan indispensable things that no-

body else will do. Upon him fall all the ‘odds and ends,

the most diﬁcult things.

2. After every body else is through, he has to ﬁnish up.
His work is like a woman’s,—perpetually waiting on others.
Every body knows how much easier it is to eat a good
dinner than it is to wash the dishes afterwards. Consider
what a boy on a farm is required to do; things that must
be done, or life would actually stop.

3. It is understood, in the first place, that he is to do all
the errands, to go to the store, to the post-office, and to
carry all sorts of messages. If he had as many legs as a
centiped, they would tire before night. His two short
limbs seem to him entirely inadequate to the task. He
would like to have as many legs as a wheel has spokes, and
rotate about in the same way.

4. This he sometimes tries to do ; and the people who
have seen him “turning cart-Wheels” along the side of the
road, have supposed that he was amusing himself and idling
his time; he was only trying to invent a new mode of loco-
motion, so that he could economize his legs, and do his
errands with greater dispatch. H

5. He practices standing on his head, in order to accus-
tom himself to any position. Leap-frog is one of his

FIFTH READER. 51

methods of getting over the ground quickly. He would
willingly go an errand any distance if he could leap-frog it
with a few other boys. 4 M

6. He has a natural genius for combining pleasure with
business. This is the reason why, when he is sent to the
spring for a pitcher of water, he is absent so long; for he
stops to poke the frog that sits on the ‘stone, or, if there is

a pen-stock, to put his hand over the spout, and squirt the .

water a little while.

7. He is the one who spreads the grass when the men
have cut it; he mows it away in the barn; he rides the
horse, to cultivate the corn, up and down the hot, weary
rows; he picks up the potatoes when they are dug; he
drives the cows night and morning; he brings wood and
water, and splits kindling; he gets up the horse, and puts
out the horse; Whether he is in the house or out of it,
there is always something for him to do.

8. Just before the school in winter he shovels paths; in
summer he turns the grindstone. He knows where there
are lots of wintergreens and sweet-ﬂags, but, instead of go-
ing for them, he is to stay in-doors and pare apples, and
stone raisins, and pound something in a mortar. And yet,
with his mind full of schemes of what he would like to do,
[and his hands full of occupations, he is an idle boy,who has
nothing to busy himself with but school and chores!

9. He would gladly do all the work if somebody else
would do the chores, he thinks; and yet I doubt if any boy

‘ ever amounted to any thing in the world, or was of much

use as a man, who did not enjoy the advantages of a liberal
education in the way of chores.

VI. THE SINGING LESSON.

Jean Ingelow (b. 1830, ) was born at Boston, Lincolnshire, En-
gland. Her fame as a poetess was at once established upon the publica-
tion of her “Poems” in 1863; since which time several other volumes
have appeared. The most generally admired of her poems are “Songs of
Seven” and “The High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire.’’ She has
also written several successful novels, of which “ Off the Skelligs ” is the
most popular. “Stories Told to a Child,” “The Cumberers,” “Poor
Mat,” “Studies for Stories,” and “Mopsa, the Fairy” are also well
known. Miss Ingelow now resides in London, England, and spends
much of her time in deeds of charity.

1. A NIGHTINGALE made a mistake;
' She sang a few notes out of tune:
Her heart was ready to break,
And she hid away from the moon.
She wrung her claws, poor thing,
But was far too proud to weep;
She tucked her head under her wing,
And pretended to be asleep.

2. A lark, arm in arm with a thrush,
Came sauntering up to the place;
The nightingale felt herself blush,
Though feathers hid her face;
She knew they had heard her song
She felt them snicker and sneer;
She thought that life was too long,
And wished she could skip a year.

3. “ O nightingale!” cooed a (love;
“ O nightingale! what’s the use?
You bird of beauty and love,
Why behave like a goose?
Don’t sulk away from our sight,
Like a common, contemptible fowl;
You bird of joy and delight,
Why behave like an owl?

4. “Only think of all you have done;

Only think of all you can do;

A false note is really fun
From such a bird as you!

Lift up your proud little crest,
Open your musical beak; .

Other birds have to do their best,
You need only to speak! ”

5. The nightingale shyly took
Her head from under her wing,
And, giving the dove a look,
Straightway began to sing.

There was never a bird could pass;
The night was divinely calm;
And the people stood on the grass

To hear that Wonderful psalm.

6. The nightingale did not care,
She only sang to the skies;
Her song ascended there,
And there she ﬁxed her eyes.
The people that stood below
She knew but little about;
And this tale has a moral, I know,
If you ’ll try and ﬁnd it out.

DEFINITIONs.——2. Saun’ter-ing, wandering i dlg, strolling.

‘ Snick’ er, to laugh in a half suppressed manner. 4. Crest, a tuft

growing on an animal’s head. 5. Di-vine’ly, in a supreme degree.
6. Mor’al, the practical lesson which any thing is ﬁtted to teach.

NOTE..———-The nightingale is a small bird, about six inches in
length, with a coat of dark-brown feathers above and of grayish-
White beneath. Its voice is astonishingly strong and sweet, and,
when Wild, it usually sings throughout the evening and- night

from April to the middle of summer. The bird is common "in,

Europe, but is not found in America.

VII. DO NOT MEDDLE.

1. ABOUT twenty years ago there lived a singular gentle-
man in the Old Hall among the elm—trees. He was about
three-score years of age, very rich, and somewhat odd in
many of his habits, but for generosity and benevolence he
had no equal. .

2. N 0 poor cottager stood in need of comforts,which he
was not ready to supply; no sick man or woman languished

for want of his assistance; and not even a beggar, unless a’

known impostor, went empty-handed from the Hall. Like
the village pastor described in Goldsmith’s poem of the De-
serted Village,

“His house was known to all the vagrant train;
He chid their wa1_1d’rings, but relieved their pain;
The long-remembered beggar was his guest,
Whose beard descending swept his aged breast.”

3. Now it happened that the old gentleman wanted a

boy to wait upon him at table, and to attend him in differ-
ent ways, for he was very fond of young people. But
much as he liked the society of the young, he had a great
aversion to that curiosity in which many young people are
apt to indulge. He used to say, “ The boy who will peep
into a drawer will be tempted to take something out of it;
and he who will steal a penny in his youth will steal a
pound in his manhood.”
ii 4. N o sooner was it known that the old gentleman was in
want of a boy, than twenty applications were made for the
situation; but he determined not to engage any one until
he had in some way ascertained that he did not possess a
curious, prying disposition.

5. On Monday morning seven lads, dressed in their Sun-
day clothes, with bright and happy faces, made their ap-
pearance at the Hall, each of them desiring to obtain the

situation. Now the old gentleman, being of a singular dis- ‘

FIFTH READER. 55

position, had prepared a room in such a way that he might
easily know if any of the young people who applied were
given to meddle unnecessarily with things around them, or
to peep into cupboards and drawers. He took care that
the lads who were then at Elm-Tree Hall should be shown
into this room one after another.

6. And ﬁrst, Charles Brown was sent into the room, and

told that he would have to wait a little. So Charles sat.

down on a chair near the door. ‘VF or some time he was
Very quiet, and looked about him; but there seemed to be
so many curious things in the room that at last he got up to
peep at them.

7. On the table was placed a dish cover, and Charles
wanted sadly to know what was under it, but he felt afraid
of lifting it up. Bad habits are strong things; and, as

Charles was of a curious disposition, he could not withstand.

the temptation of taking one peep. So he lifted up the
cover.

8. This turned out to be a sad affair; for under the dish
cover was a heap of very light feathers; part of the feath-
ers, drawn up by a current of air, ﬂew about the room,
and Charles, in his fright, putting the cover down hastily,
puffed the rest of them off the table.

9. What was to be done? Charles began to pick up the
feathers one by one; but the old gentleman, who was in an
adjoining room, hearing a scuffle, and guessing the cause of

it, entered the room, to the consternation of Charles Brown, .

who was Very soon dismissed as a boy who had not princi-
ple enough to resist even a slight temptation.

10. When. the room was once more arranged, Henry
Wilkins was placed there until such time as he should be
sent for. No sooner was he left to himself than his atten-
tion was attracted by a plate of fine, ripe cherries. Now
Henry was uncommonly fond of cherries, and he thought it
would be impossible to miss one cherry among so many.
He ‘looked and longed, and longed and looked, for some

56 E OLE OTI 0 SERIES’.

time, and just as he had got off his seat to take one, he
heard, as he thought, a foot coming to the door; but no,
it was a false alarm.

11. Taking fresh courage, he went cautiously and took a
very ﬁne cherry, for he was determined to take but one,
and put it into his mouth. It was excellent; and then he
persuaded himself that he ran no risk in taking another;
this he did, and hastily popped it into his mouth.

12. Now, the old gentleman had placed a few artiﬁcial

' cherries at the top of the others, ﬁlled with Cayenne pep-

per; one of these Henry had unfortunately taken, and it
made his mouth smart and burn most intolerably. The
old gentleman heard him coughing, and knew very well
what was the matter. The boy that would take what did
not belong to him, if no more than a cherry, was not the

-boy for him. Henry Wilkins was sent about his business

without delay, with his mouth almost as hot as if he had
put a burning coal into it.

-‘ 13. Rufus Wilson was next introduced into the room and
left to himself; but he had not been there ten minutes be-
fore he began to move from one place to another. He was
of a bold, resolute temper, but not overburdened with prin-
ciple; for if he could have opened every cupboard, closet,
and drawer in the house, without being found out, he
would have done it directly.

14. Having looked around the room, he noticed a drawer
to the table, and made up his mind to peep therein. But
no sooner did he lay hold of the drawer knob than he set
a large bell ringing, which was concealed under the table.
The old gentleman immediately answered the summons, and

_ entered the room.

15. Rufus was so startled by the sudden ringing of the
bell, that all his impudence could not support him. He
looked as though any one might knock him down with a
feather. The old gentleman asked him if he had rung the
bell because he wanted any thing. Rufus was much con-

FIFTH READER. 57

fused, and stammered, and tried to excuse himself, but all
to no purpose, for it did not prevent him from being or-
dered oﬁ' the premises. .

16. George Jones was then shown into the room by an
old steward; and being of a cautious disposition, he touched
nothing, but only looked at the things about him. At
last he saw that a closet door was a little open, and, think-

ing it would be impossible ‘for any one to know that he had -

opened it a little more, he Very cautiously opened it an
inch farther, looking down at the bottom of the door, that
it might not catch against any thing and make a noise.
17. Now had he looked at the top, instead of the bottom,
it might have been better for him; for to the top of the
door was fastened a plug,which ﬁlled up the hole of a small
barrel of shot. He ventured to open the door another inch,
and then another, till, the plug being pulled out of the bar-
rel, the leaden shot began to pour out at a strange rate; at

the bottom of the closet was placed a tin pan, and the shot

falling upon this pan made such a clatter that George was
frightened half out of his senses.‘

18. The old gentleman soon came into the room to in-
quire what was the matter, and there he found George
nearly as pale as a sheet. George was soon dismissed.

19. It now came the turn of Albert Jenkins to be put
into the room. The other boys had been sent to their
homes by different ways, and no one knew what the expe-
rience of the other had been in the room of trial.

20. On the table stood a small round box, with a screw
top to it, and Albert, thinking it contained something curi-
ous, could not be easy without unscrewing the top; but no
sooner did he do this than out bounced an artiﬁcial snake,
full a yard long, and fell upon his arm. He started back,
and ,.iji1ttered a scream which brought the old gentleman to
his elbow. There stood Albert, with the bottom of the box

A in one hand, the top in the other, and the snake on the

floor.

21. “ Come, come,” said the old gentleman, “ one snake
is quite enough to have in the house at a time; therefore,
the sooner you are gone the better.” With that he dis-
missed him, without waiting a moment for his reply.

22. William Smith next entered the room, and being left
alone soon began to amuse himself in looking at the curi-
osities around him. William was not only curious and pry-
ing, but dishonest, too, and observing that the key was left

in the drawer of a book-case, he stepped on tiptoe in that

direction. The key had a wire fastened to it, which com-
municated with an electrical machine, and William received
such .a shock as he was not likely to forget. No sooner did
he sufﬁciently recover himself to walk, than he was told to
leave the house, and let other people lock and unlock their
own drawers.  

23. The other boy was Harry Gordon, and though he
was left in the room full twenty minutes, he never during
that time stirred from his chair. Harry had eyes in his
head as well as the others, but -he had more integrity in
his heart; neither the dish cover, the cherries, the drawer
knob, the closet door, the round box, nor the key tempted
him to rise from his seat; and the consequence was that,
in half an hour after, he was engaged in the service of the
old gentleman at Elm-Tree Hall. He followed his good
old master to his grave, and received a large legacy for his
upright conduct in his service.

IX. THE MANIAC.

1. A GENTLEMAN who had traveled in Europe, relates
that he one day visited the hospital of Berlin, where he

i saw a man whose exterior was very striking. His ﬁgure,

tall and commanding, was bending with age, but more with
sorrow; the few scattered hairs which remained on his tem-
ples were white almost as the driven snow, and the deepest
melancholy was depicted in his countenance.

2. On inquiring who he was and what brought him
there, he started, as if from sleep, and, after looking around
him, began with slow and measured steps to stride the hall,
repeating in a low but audible voice, “ Once one is two;
once one is two.” '

3. Now and then he would stop, and remain with his
arms folded on his breast as if in contemplation, for some
minutes; then again resuming his walk, he continued to
repeat, “Once one is two; once one is two.” His story, as
our traveler understood it, was as follows.

4. Conrad Lange, collector of the revenues of the city of
Berlin, had long been known as a man whom nothing could
divert from the paths of honesty. Scrupulously exact in
all his dealings, and assiduous in the discharge of all his
duties, he had acquired the good-will and esteem of all
who knew him, and the conﬁdence of the minister of
ﬁnance, whose duty it is to inspect the accounts of all
oﬂicers connected with the revenue.

5. On casting up his accounts at the close of a particular
year, he found a deﬁcit of ten thousand ducats. Alarmed
at this discovery, he went to the minister, presented his
accounts, and informed him that he did not know how’ it

had arisen, and that he had been robbed by some person

bent on his ruin.
6. The minister received his accounts, but thinking it -a
duty to secure a person who might probably be a defaulter,

S

FIFTH READER. 61
he caused him to be arrested, and put his accounts into the
hands of one of his secretaries for inspection, Who returned
them the day after with the information that the deﬁciency
arose from a miscalculation; that in multiplying, Mr. Lange
had said, once one is two, instead of once one is one.

7. The poor man was immediately released from conﬁne-
ment, his accounts returned, and the mistake pointed out.

During his imprisonment, which lasted two days, he had.

neither eaten, drank, nor taken any repose; and when he
appeared, his countenance was as pale as death. On receiv-
ing his accounts, he was a long time silent; then suddenly
awaking, as if from a trance, he repeated, “ Once one is
two.” i

8. He appeared to be entirely insensible of his situation;
would neither eat nor drink, unless solicited; and took
notice of nothing that passed around him. While repeat-
ing his accustomed phrase, if any one corrected him by
saying, “ Once one is one,” his attention was arrested for a
moment, and he said, “Ah, right, once one is one;” and
then resuming his Walk, he continued to repeat, “Once one
is two.” He died shortly after the traveler left Berlin.

9. This affecting story, Whether true or untrue, obviously
abounds with lessons of instruction. Alas! how easily is
the human mind thrown oﬁ” its balance; especially when it
is stayed on this World only, and has no experimental
knowledge of the meaning of the injunction of Scripture,
to cast all our cares upon Him Who careth for us, and who
heareth even the young ravens when they cry.

X. ROBIN REDBREAST.

William Allingham (b. 1828, ) was born at Ballyshannon, Ire-
land. His father was a banker, and gave him a good education in Irish
schools. He showed his literary tastes at an early date, contributing to
periodicals, etc. In 1850 he published his ﬁrst volume of poems; in 1864
his “Day and Night Songs” appeared, and in 1864 a poem in twelve
chapters entitled “ Laurence Bloomﬁeld in Ireland.” His reputation has
been established chieﬂy through his shorter lyrics, or ballad poetry.
Since 1864 he has received a literary pension.

Mass. His boyhood was passed on a farm, and he never received a clas-
sical education. In 1829 he edited a newspaper in Boston. In the follow-
ing year he removed to Hartford, Conn., to assume a similar position.
In 1836 he edited an anti-slavery paper in Philadelphia. Since 1840 he
has resided in Amesbury, Mass. Mr. Whittier’s parents were Friends,
and he has always held to the same faith. He has written extensively
both inpprose and Verse. As a poet, he ranks among those most highly
esteemed and honored by his countrymen. “Snow-Bound,” published
in 1865, is one of the longest and best of his poems.

 

1. OUR bachelor uncle Who lived with us Was a quiet,
genial man, much given to hunting and ﬁshing; and it was
one of the pleasures of our young life to accompany him on
his expeditions to Great Hill, Brandy-brow Woods, the

Pond, and, best of all, to the Country Brook. We were
quite Willing to work hard in the corn-ﬁeld or the haying-
lot to ﬁnish the necessary day’s labor in season for an
afternoon stroll through the woods and along the brook-
side.

2. I remember my ﬁrst ﬁshing excursion as if it were
but yesterday. I have been happy many times in my life,
but never more intensely so than when I received that ﬁrst
ﬁshing-pole from my uncle’s hand, and trudged off with
him through the woods and meadows. It was a still,
sweet day of early summer; the long afternoon shadows
of the trees lay cool across our path; the leaves seemed
greener, the ﬂowers brighter, the birds merrier, than ever
before.

3. My uncle, who knew by long experience where were
the best haunts of pickerel, considerately placed me at the
most favorable point. I threw out my line as I had so
often seen others, and waited anxiously for a bite, moving
the bait in rapid jerks on the surface of the water in
imitation of the leap of a frog. Nothing came of it.
“ Try again,” said my uncle. Suddenly the bait sank out
of sight. “Now for it,” thought I; “here is a ﬁsh at
last.”

4. I made a strong pull, and brought up a tangle of
weeds. Again and again I cast out my line with aching
arms, and drew it back empty. I looked at my uncle ap-
pealingly. “Try once more,” he said; “ we ﬁshermen
must have patience.”

5. Suddenly something tugged at my line, a.nd swept off’
with it into deep water. Jerking it up, I saw a ﬁne pick-
erel wriggling in the sun. “Uncle!” I cried, looking back
in uncontrollable excitement, “I’ve got a ﬁsh!” “Not
yet,” said my uncle. As he spoke there was a plash in
the water; I caught the arrowy gleam of a scared ﬁsh
shooting into the middle of the stream, my hook hung
empty from the line. I had lost- my prize.

and self-respect, keep the proprieties, and, if possible, avoid
a scene; but the sorrow of childhood, unreasoning and all-
absorbing, is a complete abandonment to the passion. The
doll’s nose is broken, and the World breaks up with it; the
marble rolls out of sight, and the solid globe rolls off with
the marble.

7. So, overcome with my great and bitter disappoint-
ment, I sat down on the nearest hassock, and for a time re-
fused to be comforted, even by my ‘uncle’s assurance that
there were more ﬁsh in the brook. He reﬁtted ‘my bait,
and, putting the pole again in my hands, told me to try
my luck once more.

8. “ But remember, boy,” he said, with his shrewd smile,
“ never brag of catching a ﬁsh until he is on dry ground.
I’ve seen older folks doing that in more Ways than one,
and so making fools of themselves. It ’s no use to boast
of any thing until it ’s done, nor then, either, for it speaks
for itself.”

9. How often since I have been reminded of the ﬁsh
that I did not catch. VVhen I hear people boasting of a
work as yet undone, and trying to anticipate the credit
Which belongs only to actual achievement, I call to mind
that scene by the brookside, and the Wise caution of my
uncle in that particular instance takes the form of a prov-
erb of universal application: “NEVER BRAG OF YOUR FISH
BEFORE YOU CATCH HIM.”

XII. IT SNOWS.

Sarah Josepha Hale (b. 1795, d. 1879) was born in Newport, N. H. Her
maiden name was Buell. In 1814 she married David Hale, an eminent
lawyer, who died in 1822. Left with ﬁve children to support, she turned
her attention to literature. In 1828 she became editor of the “ Ladies’
Magazine.” In 1837 this periodical was united with “Godey’s Lady’s
Book,” of which Mrs. Hale was literary editor for more than forty years.

1. “IT snows!” cries the School-boy, “Hurrah I’-’ and his ‘

shout
Is ringing through parlor and hall,
While swift as the wing of a swallow, he’s out,
And his playmates have answered his call;
It makes the heart leap but to witness their joy;
Proud wealth has no pleasures, I trow,
Like the rapture that throbs in the pulse of the boy,
As he gathers “his treasures of snow;
Then lay not the trappings of gold on thine heirs,
While health, and the riches of nature, are theirs.

2. “It snows!” sighs the Imbecile, “Ah!” and his breath

Comes heavy, as clogged with a Weight;

While, from the pale aspect of nature in death,
He turns to the blaze of his grate;

And nearer and nearer, his soft-cushioned chair
Is Wheeled toward the life-giving ﬂame;

He dreads a chill puﬁ“ of the snow-burdened air,
Lest it wither his delicate frame;

Oh! small is the pleasure existence can give,

When the fear we shall die only proves that We live!

3. “It snows!” cries the Traveler, “ Ho! ” and the word

Has quickened his steed’s lagging pace;

The wind rushes by, but its howl is unheard,
Unfelt the sharp drift in his face;

For bright through the tempest his own home appeared,
Ay, though leagues intervened, he can see:

And his wife with her babes at her knee;
Blest thought! how it lightens the grief-laden hour,
That those we love dearest are safe from its power!

4. “It snows! ” cries the Belle, “Dear, how lucky!” and
turns
, From her mirror to watch the ﬂakes fall,
Like the ﬁrst rose of summer, her dimpled cheek burns,
While musing on sleigh-ride and ball:
There are Visions of conquests, of splendor, and mirth,
Floating over each drear winter’s day;
But the tintings of Hope, on this storm-beaten earth, _
Will melt like the snowﬂakes away.
Turn, turn thee to Heaven, fair maiden, for bliss;
That world has a pure fount ne’er opened in this.

5. “It snows!” cries the Widow, “O God!” and her sighs
Have stiﬂed the Voice of her prayer;
Its burden ye ’ll read in her tear-swollen eyes,
On her cheek sunk with fasting and care.
’T is night, and her fatherless ask her for bread,
But “ He gives the young ravens their food,”
And she trusts till her dark hearth adds horror to dread,
And she lays on her last chip of wood.
Poor sufferer! that sorrow thy! God only knows;
’T is a most bitter lot to be poor, when it snows!

XIII. RESPECT FOR THE SABBATH REWARDED.

1. IN the city of Bath, not many years since, lived a bar-
ber who made a practice of following his ordinary occupation
on the Lord’s day. As he was on the way to his morning’s
employment, he happened to look into some place of wor-

ship just as the minister was giving out his text—“ Re- .

member the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” He listened
long enough to be convinced that he was constantly break-
ing the laws of God and man by shaving and dressing his
customers on the Lord’s day. He became uneasy, and
went with a heavy heart to his Sabbath task.

2. At length he took courage, and opened his mind to
his minister, who advised him to give up Sabbath work,
and worship God. He replied that beggary would be the

. consequence. He had a ﬂourishing trade, but it would

almost all be lost. At length, after many a sleepless night
spent in weeping and praying, he was determined to cast

  all his care upon ‘God, as the more he reﬂected the more

his duty became apparent.

3. He discontinued his Sabbath work, went constantly
and early to the public services of religion, and soon en-
joyed that satisfaction of mind which is one of the rewards
of doing our duty, and that peace which the world can
neither give nor take away. The consequences he foresaw
actually followed. His genteel customers left him, and he

was nicknamed “Puritan” or “Methodist.” He was obliged

to give up his fashionable shop, and, in the course of years,
became so reduced as to take a cellar under the old market-
house and shave the poorer people. .

4. One Saturday evening, between light and dark, a
stranger from one of the coaches, asking for a barber, was
directed by the hostler to the cellar opposite. Coming in

‘ hastily, he requested to be shaved quickly, while they

changed horses, as he did not like to violate the Sabbath.

70   EOLECTJO SERIES.

This was touching the barber on a tender chord. He burst
into tears; asked the stranger to lend him a half--penny to
buy a candle, as it was not light enough to shave him with
safety. He did so, revolving in his mind the extreme pov-
erty to which the poor man must be reduced.

5. When shaved, he said, “There must be something
extraordinary in your history, which I have not now time
to hear. Here is half a crown for you. When I return,
I will call and investigate your case. VVhat is your name?”

' “ William Reed,” said the astonished barber. “William

Reed?” echoed the stranger: “William Reed? by your
dialect you are from the West.” “Yes, sir, from Kings-
ton, near Taunton.” “William Reed, from Kingston, near
Taunton? What was your father’s name?” “ Thomas.”
“ Had he any brother?” “Yes, sir, one, after whom I
was named; but he went to the Indies, and, as we never
heard from him, we supposed him to be dead.”

6. “ Come along, follow me,” said the stranger, “ I am
going to see a person who says his name is VVilliam Reed,
of Kingston, near Taunton. Come and confront him. If
you prove to be indeed he who you say you are, I have
glorious news for you. Your uncle is dead, and has left
an immense fortune, which I will put you in possession of
when all legal doubts are removed.”

7. They went by the coach; saw the pretended William
Reed, and proved him to be an impostor. The stranger,
who was a pious attorney, was soon legally satisﬁed of the
barber’s identity, and told him that he had advertised him
in vain. Providence had now thrown him in his way in a
most extraordinary manner, and he had great pleasure in
transferring a great many thousand pounds to a worthy
man, the rightful heir of the property. Thus was man’s
extremity God’s opportunity. Had the poor barber pos-
sessed one half-penny, or even had credit for a candle, he
might have remained unknown for years‘; but he trusted
God, who never said, “ Seek ye my face,” in vain.

XIV. THE SANDS O’ DEE.

Charles Kingsley (b. 1819, d. 1875) was born at Holne, Devonshire, En-
gland. He took his bachelor’s degree at Cambridge in 1842,and soon after
entered the Church. His Writings are quite voluminous, including ser-
mons, lectures, novels, fairy tales, and poems, published in book form,
besides numerous miscellaneous sermons and magazine articles. He
was an earnest Worker for bettering the condition of the Working classes,
and this object Was the basis of most of his Writings. As a lyfric poet he
has gained a high place. The “Saint’s Tragedy” and “Andromeda”
are the most pretentious of his poems, and “ Alton Locke ” and “ Hypa-
tia” are his best known novels.

1. “O MARY, go and call the cattle home,’
And call the cattle home,
And call the cattle home,
Across the sands 0’ Dee!”
The Western Wind was wild and dank with foam,
And all alone went she.

2. The creeping tide came up along the sand,
And o’er and o’er the sand,
And round and round the sand,
As far as eye could see;
The blinding mist came down and hid the land-
And never home came she.

4. They rowed her in across the rolling foam,
The cruel, crawling foam,
The cruel, hungry foam,
To her grave beside the sea;

But still the boatmen hear her call the cattle home,
Across the sands o’ Dee. '

though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

I will fear no evil; for thou art with me: thy rod and

thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before
me in the presence of mine enemies; thou anointest my
head i with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely, goodness
and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

XVII. THE VENOMOUS WORM.

John Russell (b. 1793, d. 1868) graduated at Middlebury College, Vt., in
1818. He was at one time editor of the “Backwoodsman,” published at
Grafton, I11s., and later of the “ Louisville Advocate.” He was the author
of many tales of Western adventure and of numerous essays, sketches,
etc. His language is clear, chaste and classical; his style concise, vigor-
ous, and sometimes highly ornate.

1. WHO has not heard of the rattlesnake or copperhead? ,
An unexpected sight of either of these reptiles will make
even the lords of creation recoil; but there is a species of
worm, found in various parts of this country, which conveys
a poison of a nature so deadly that, compared with it,
even the venom of the rattlesnake is harmless. To guard
our readers against this foe of human kind" is the object
of this lesson.

2. This worm varies much in size. It is frequently an
inch in diameter, but, as it is rarely seen except when
coiled, its length can hardly be conjectured. It is of a
dull lead color, a11d generally lives near a spring or small
stream of water, and bites the unfortunate people who are
in the habit of going there to drink. The brute creation it
never molests. They avoid it with the same instinct that
teaches the animals of India to shun the deadly cobra.

3. Several of these reptiles have long infested our settle-
ments, to the misery and destruction of many of our fellow-
citizens. I have, therefore, had frequent opportunities of
being the melancholy spectator of the effects produced by
the subtile poison which this worm infuses.

4. The symptoms of its bite are terrible. The eyes of
the patient become red and ﬁery, his tongue swells to an
immoderate size, and obstructs his utterance; and delirium
of the most horrid character quickly follows. Sometimes,
in his madness, he attempts the destruction of his nearest
friends.

helpless infants are not unfrequently the objects of his

Devoted hearts already bound
For good or ill, will bind again.

What could that evening’s bliss enhance?

And years have ﬂown; but where are now
The guests, who round that table met?

Rises their sun as gloriously
As on the banquet’s eve it set?

How holds the chain which friendship wove?
It broke; and soon the hearts it‘ bound

Were widely sundered; and for peace,
Envy, and strife, and blood were found.

The merriest laugh which then was heard,

‘ Has changed its tones to maniac screams,

As half-quenched memory kindles up
Glimmerings of guilt in feverish dreams.

. And where is she, whose diamond eyes

‘Grolconda’s purest gems outshone?
Whose roseate lips of Eden breathed?
Say, where is she, the beauteous one?

Beneath yon willow’s drooping shade,
With eyes now dim, and lips all pale,

She sleeps in peace.‘ Read on her urn,
“A broken heart.” This tells her tale.

Temptation walks, to lure you on,

Ere long it will be fanned by sighs,

XX. THE BATTLE OF BLENHEIM.

Robert Southey (b. 1774, d. 1843) was born in Bristol, England. He
entered Ba.lio1 College, Oxford, in 1793. In 1804 he established himself
permanently at Greta Hall, near Keswick, Cumberland, in the ‘‘lake
country,” where he enjoyed the friendship and society of Wordsworth
and Coleridge, other poets of the “Lake School.” He was appointed
poet laureate in 1813, and received a pension of £300 a year from the gov-
ernment in 1835. Mr. Southey was a voluminous writer in both prose
and verse. As a poet, he can not be placed in the ﬁrst rank, although
some of his minor pieces are very happy in thought and expression.
Among his most noted poetical works are “ Joan of Arc,” “ Thalaba the
Destroyer,” “Madoc,” “Roderick,” and the “Curse 01’ Kehama.”

1. IT was a summer evening,
Old Kaspar’s work was done,
And he, before his cottage door,
Was sitting in the sun;
And by him sported on the green,
His little grandchild Wilhelmine.

32. She saw her brother Peterkin
Roll something large and round,
Which he beside the rivulet,
In playing there, had found;
He came to ask what he had found,
That was so large, and smooth, and round.

Young Peterkin he cries;

While little Wilhelmine looks up
With wonder-Waiting eyes;

XXI. “I PITY THEM.”

1. A POOR man once undertook to emigrate from Castine,
Me., to Illinois. VVhen he was attempting to cross a river
in New York, his horse broke through the rotten timbers
of the bridge, and was drowned. He had but this one

animal to convey all his property and his family to his ,

new home.

2. His wife a11d children were almost miraculously saved
from sharing the fate of the horse; but the loss of this
poor animal was enough. By its aid the family, it may
be said, had lived and moved; now they were left helpless
in a land of strangers, without the ability to go on or re-
turn, without money or a single friend to whom to appeal.
The case was a hard one.

3. There were a great many who “passed by on the
other side.” Some even laughed at the predicament in
which the man. was placed; but by degrees a group of
people began to collect, all of whom pitied him.

4. Some pitied him a great deal, and some did not pity
him very much, because, they said, he might have known
better than to try to cross an unsafe bridge, and should
have made his horse swim the ‘river. Pity, however,

‘seemed rather to predominate. Some pitied the man, and

some the horse; all pitied the poor, sick mother and her
six helpless children.
5. Among this pitying party was a rough son of the

T VVest, who knew what it was to migrate some hundreds of

miles over new roads to locate a destitute family on a
prairie. Seeing the man’s forlorn situation, and looking
around on the bystanders, he said,‘ “All of you seem to
pity these poor people very much, but I would beg leave
to ask each of you how much.” ‘

6. “There, stranger,” continued he, holding up a ten
dollar bill, ‘f there is the amount of my pity; and if others

will do as I do, you may soon get another pony. God
bless you.” It is needless to state the effect that this
active charity produced. In a short time the happy emi-
grant arrived at his destination, and he is now a thriving
farmer, and a neighbor to him WhO' was his “ friend in
need, and a friend indeed."

XXII. AN ELEGY ON MADAM BLAIZE.

Oliver Goldsmith (b. 1728, d. 1774) was born at Pallas, or Pallasmore,
in the parish of Forney, Ireland. He received his education at several
schools, at Trinity College, Dublin, at Edinburgh, and at Leyden. He
spent some time 111 wandering over continental Europe, often in poverty
and want. In 1756 he became a resident of London, where he made the
acquaintance of several celebrated men, among whom were Dr. Johnson
and Sir Joshua Reynolds. His writings are noted for their purity, grace,

and ﬂuency. His fame as a poet is secured by “The Traveler,” and “ The “

Deserted Vi1lage;” as a dramatist, by “She Stoops to Conquer;” and as
a novelist, by “The Vicar of Wakeﬁeld.” His reckless extraﬁgance
always kept him in ﬁnancial difﬁculty, and he died heavily  debt.
His monument is in Westminster Abbey.

1'. GOOD people all, with one accord,
Lament for Madam Blaize,
Who never wanted a good word—
From those who spoke her praise.

2. The needy seldom passed her door,
And always found her kind;
She freely lent to all the poor—-
Who left a" pledge behind

3. She strove the neighborhood to please,
With manner wondrous winning;
She never followed wicked ways—
Unless when she was sinning.

4. At church, in silks and satin new,
With hoop .of monstrous size,

She never slumbered in her pew--
But when she shut her eyes.

5. Her love was sought, I do aver,
By twenty beaux and more;
The king himself ha.s followed her-
When she has walked before.

XXIII. KING CHARLES II. AND WILLIAM PENN.

Ifing Charles. WELL, friend William! I have sold you
a noble province in North America; but still, I suppose
you have no thoughts of going thither yourself?

Penn. Yes,  have, I assure thee, friend Charles; and
I am just come to bid thee farewell.

K. C‘. VVhat! venture yourself among the savages of
North America! Why, man, what security have you that
you will not be in their war-kettle in two hours after setting
foot on their shores? '

P. The best security in the world.

K. C’. I doubt that, friend William; I have no idea
of any security against those cannibals but in a regiment
of good soldiers, with their muskets and bayonets. And
mind, I tell you beforehand, that, with all my good-will
for you and your family, to whom I am under obligations,

. I will not send a single soldier with you.

FIFTH READER. 39

P. I Want none of thy soldiers, Charles: I depend on ,

something better than thy soldiers.

K.  Ah! what may that be?

P. VVhy, I depend upon themselves; on the Working
of their own hearts; on their notions of justice; on their
moral sense. ,

K. C‘. A ﬁne thing, this same moral sense, no doubt;

but I fear you will not ﬁnd much of it among the Indians .

of North America.

P. And why not among them as well as others?

K. 0’. Because if they had possessed any, they would
not have treated my subjects so barbarously as they have
done.  

P. That is no proof of the contrary, friend Charles.
Thy subjects were the aggressors. VVhen thy subjects ﬁrst
went to North America, they found these poor people the
foI1dest and kindest creatures in the World. Every day
they would Watch for them to come ashore, and hasten to
meet them, and feast them on the best ﬁsh, and venison,
and corn, which were all they had. In return for this
hospitality of the savages, as we call them, thy subjects,
termed Clmlstians, seized on their country and rich hunting
grounds for farms for themselves. Now, is it to be W()I1-
dered at, that these much injured people should have been
driven to desperation by such injustice; and that, burning
with revenge, they should have committed some excesses?
‘ K. 0. Well, then, I hope you will not complain when
they come to treat you in the same manner. '

P. I am not afraid of it. i

K. 0. Ah! how vvill you avoid it? You mean to get
their hunting grounds, too, I suppose?

P. Yes, but not by driving these poor people away,

from them.
K. C‘. No, indeed? How then will you get their
lands? .
P. I mean to buy their lands of them.

90 EOLECTIC SERIES.

K. 0. Buy their lands of them? Why, man, you have
already bought them of me!

P. Yes, I know I have, and at a dear rate, too: but
I did it only to get thy good-will, not that I thought thou
hadst any right to their lands.

K. 0. How, man? no right to their lands?

P. No, friend Charles, no right; no right at all: what
right hast thou to their lands? -

K. C. VVhy, the right of discovery, to be sure; the
right which the Pope a11d all Christian kings have agreed
to give one another.

P. The right of discovery? A strange kind of right,
indeed. Now suppose, friend Charles, that some canoe load
of these Indians, crossing the sea, and discovering this
island of Great Britain, were to claim it as their own, and
set it up for sale over thy head, what Wouldst thou think
of it?

K. C. Why———why—why—I must confess, I should
think it a piece of great impudence in them.

P. VVell, then, how canst thou, a Christian, and a
Christian prince, too, do that which thou so utterly con-
demnest in these people, whom thou callest savages? And
suppose, again, that these Indians, on thy refusal to give
up thy island of Great Britain, were to make war on thee,
and, having weapons more destructive than thine, were to
destroy many of thy subjects, and drive the rest away-
wouldst thou not think it horribly cruel?

K. C. .I must say, friend William, that I should; how
can I say otherwise?

P. Well, then, how can I, who call myself a Christian,
do what I should abhor even in the heathen? No. I will
not do it. But I will buy the right of the proper owners,
even of the Indians themselves. By doing this, I shall
imitate God himself in his justice and mercy, and thereby
insure his blessing on my colony, if I should ever live to
plant one in North America. __MaS0n L_ Weemg

For the wrongs that need resistance,

And the good that I can do.

XXV. THE RIGHTEOUS NEVER FORSAKEN.

1. IT was Saturday night, and the widow of the Pine
Cottage sat by her blazing fagots, with her ﬁve tattered
children at her side, endeavoring by listening to the art-
lessness of their prattle to dissipate the heavy gloom that
pressed upon her mind. For a year, her own feeble hand
had provided for her helpless family, for she had no sup-
porter: she thought of no friend in all the wide, unfriendly
world around.

FIFTH READER. 93

2. But that mysterious Providence, the wisdom of whose
Ways is above human comprehension, had visited her with
Wasting sickness, and her little means had become ex-
hausted. It was now, too, midwinter, and the snow lay
heavy and deep through all the surrounding forests, while
storms still seemed gathering in the heavens, and the driv-
ing wind roared amid the neighboring pines, and rocked
her puny mansion.

3. The last herring smoked upon the coals before her;i

it Was the only article of food she possessed, and no won-
der her forlorn, desolate state brought up in her lone
bosom all the anxieties of a mother when she looked upon
her children: and no Wonder, forlorn as she was, if she
suffered the heart-swellings of despair to rise, even though
she knew that He, whose promise is to the widow and to
the orphan, can not forget his Word. r

4. Providence had, many years before, taken from her
her eldest son, who went from his forest home to try his
fortune on the high seas, since which she had heard no
tidings of him; and, in her latter time, had, by the hand
of death, deprived her of the companion and staff‘ of her
earthly pilgrimage, in the person of her husband. Yet to
this hour she had upborne; she had not only been able to

‘provide for her little ﬂock, but had never lost an oppor-

tunity of ministering to the Wants of the miserable and
destitute. .

5. The indolent may Well bear with poverty while the
ability to gain sustenance remains. The individual who
has but his own Wants to supply, may suffer with fortitude
the winter of want; his affections are not wounded, his
heart is not wrung. The most desolate in populous cities
may hope, for charity has not quite closed her hand and
heart, and shut her eyes 011 misery.

these to console her. And such a one was the widow of

But trust him for his grace;
Behind a frowning Providence
He hides a smiling face.”

7. The smoked herring was scarcelylaid upon the table,
when a gentle rap at the door and the loud barking of a
dog, attracted the attention of the family. The children ﬂew
to open it, and a weary traveler, in tattered garments, and
in apparently indifferent health, entered, and begged a lodg-

ing and a mouthful of food. Said he:   “It is now twenty- ,

four hours since I tasted bread.” The widow’s heart bled
anew, as under a fresh complication of distresses; for her
sympathies lingered not around her ﬁreside. She hesitated

not even now; rest and a share of all she had, she proffered.

to the stranger. “ VVe shall not be forsaken,” said. she,
“or suffer deeper for an act of charity.”

8. The traveler drew near the board, but when he saw
the scanty fare, he raised his eyes toward heaven with
astonishment: “And is this all your store?” said he; “and
a share of this do you offer to onelyou know not? then
never saw I charity before! But, madam,” said he, con-
tinuing, “ do you not wrong your children by giving a part
of your last mouthful to a stranger?”

9. “Ah,” said the poor widow—and the tear-drops gushed
into her eyes as she said it——“ I have a boy, a darling son,
somewhere on the face of the wide world, unless Heaven
has taken him away, and I only act toward you as I would
that others should act toward him. God, who sent manna
from heaven, can provide for us as he did for Israel; and
how should I this night offend him, if my son should be a

wanderer, destitute as you, and he should have provided.

for him a home, even poor as this, were I to turn you un-
relieved away! ” T

10. The Widow ended, and the stranger, springing from
his seat, clasped her in his arms. “God indeed has pro-
vided your son a home, and has given him wealth to re-
ward the goodness of his benefactress: my mother! oh, my
mother!” It was her long lost son, retuijned to her bosom
from the Indies. He had chosen that disguise that he
might the more completely surprise his family; and never
was surprise more perfect, or followed by a sweeter cup
of joy. T

XXVI. ABOU BEN ADHEM.

James Henry Leigh 'Hunt (b. 1784, d. 1859) was the son of a West
Indian, who married an American‘ lady, and practiced law in Phila-
delphia until the Revolution; being a tory, he then returned to England,
where Leigh Hunt Was born. The latter Wrote many verses while yet a
boy, and, in 1801, his father published a collection of them, entitled “Ju-
venilia.” For many years he was connected with various newspapers,
and, while editor of the “ Examiner,” Was imprisoned for two years, for
Writing disrespectfully of the prince regent. While in prison he Was
visited frequently by the poets Byron, Moore, Lamb, Shelley, and Keats;
and there Wrote “The Feast of the Poets,” “The Descent of Liberty, a
Mask,” and “The Story of Bimini,” which immediately gave him a rep-
utation as a poet. His writings include various translations, dramas,

novels, collections of essays, and poems.

Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,
And "saw within the moonlight in his room,
Making it rich and like a lily in bloom,

An angel Writing in a book of gold.

2. Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold;
And to the presence in the room. he said,
“What writest tho_u?” The vision raised its head,
And, with a look made of all sweet accord,
Answered, “The names of those who love the Lord.”

8. “And is mine one?” said Abou. “ Nay, not so,”
Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,
But cheerly still; and said, “I pray thee, then, '
VVrite me as one that loves his fellow-men.”

4. The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night
It came again, with a great wakening light,
And showed the names Whom love of God had blessed;
And, lo! Ben Adhem’s name led all the rest.

XXVII. LUCY FORESTER.

John Wilson (b. 1785, d. 1854), better known as “ Christopher North,” was
a celebrated author, poet, and critic, born at Paisley, Scotland, and edu-
cated at the University of Glasgow and at Oxford. In 1808 he moved to
VVestmoreland, England, where he formed one of the “Lake School” of

poets.’ While at Oxford he gained a prize for a poem on “Painting, ’

Poetry, and Architecture.” In 1820 he became Professor of Moral Philoso-
phy in the University of Edinburgh, which position he retained until
1851. He gained his greatest reputation as the chief author of “Noctes
Ambrosianee/"es.sa«ys contributed to B1ackwood’s Magazine between 1822
and 1825. Among his poems may be mentioned “The Isle of Palms”
and the “City of the Plague.” This selection is adapted from “The ‘For-
esters,” a tale of Scottish life.

1. LUCY was only six years old, but bold as a fairy; she
had gone by herself a thousand times about the braes, and

often upon errands to houses two or three miles distant.-

VVhat had her parents to fear‘? The footpaths were all
ﬁrm, and led ‘to no places of danger, nor are infants them-
selves incautious when alone -in their pastimes. Lucy went

singing into the low woods, and singing she re-appeared on
the open hill-side. VVith her small white hand on the rail,

she glided along the wooden bridge, or tripped from stone

to stone across the shallow streamlet.

2. The creature would be away for hours, and no fear be
felt on her account by any one at home; whether she had
gone, -with her basket under her arm, to borrow some arti-

cles of household use from a neighbor, or, merely for her ,

own solitary delight, had wandered off to the braes, to play
among the ﬂowers, coming back laden with Wreaths and
garlands.

3. The happy child had been invited to pass a whole day,
from morning to night, at Ladyside (a farm-house about two
miles off), with her playmates, the Maynes; and she left
home about an hour after sunrise.

4. During her absence, the house was silent but happy,
and, the evening being now far advanced, Lucy was ex-
pected home every minute, and Michael, Agnes, and Isabel,
her father, mother, and aunt, went to meet her on the way.
They walked on and on, wondering a little, but in no degree
alarmed till they reached Ladyside, and heard the cheer-
ful din of the children within, still rioting at the close of
the holiday. Jacob Mayne came to the door, but, on their
kindly asking why Lucy had not been sent home before
daylight was over, he looked painfully surprised, and said
that she had not been at Ladyside.

5. Within two hours, a hundred persons were traversing

A the hills in all directions, even at a distance which it

seemed most unlikely that poor Lucy could have reached.
The shepherds and their dogs, all the night through,
searched every nook, every stony and rocky place, every
piece of taller heather, every crevice that could conceal
any thing alive or dead, but no Lucy was there.

6. Her mother, who for a while seemed inspired with

‘supernatural strength, had joined in the search, and with

a quaking heart looked into every brake, or stopped and
