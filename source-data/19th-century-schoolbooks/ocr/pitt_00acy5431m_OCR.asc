Directions how to spewnd outr Time.
1. WVE all of us complain of the shortness of timne
saith Seneca, -and!-et have much more than we knoivw what
to do with. Our lives, says he, are spent either in dloing nothing at all, or in doing nothing to tlhe purpose,
or in doing nothing' that wve oulght to do; we are alwvays
complaining our days are few, and acting as thougth there
would be no enAd of themu. That noble philosopher has
described our inconsistency with ourselves in this )articular, by all those various turins of expression and thought
which are peculiar to his writings.
2. I ofteln consider maniikindl as wholly inconsistelit
witlh itself in a poinlt ttha;t bears sonme affin.ity to the fo,lmer.'Though w\-e seem  grieved at the shortness af li'c
in general, we are w-ishing every period of it at ai. e:di.
The minor longs to be at age, then to be a Imali of.sincss) then to m1ake up an estate, then io arri,c at ho5 4    The Young Gentleman and.Lady's Monitdr,' by a cruel jealousy, the other by a furious ambition; o6,
the actions of men follow their passions as naturally as' light does heat, or as any other effect flows from its' cause; reason must be employed in adjusting the pas-' sions, but they must ever remain the principles of action.
5.' The strange and absurd variety thlat is so apparent
in men's actions, shews plainly they can never proceed' immediately fiom reason; so pure a fountain emits no' such troubled waters: they must necessarily arise from' the passions, which are to the mind as the winds to a
ship; they only can move it, and they too often destroy' it; if fair and gentle, they guide it into the harbour; if' contrary and furious, they overset it in the waves.
6.' In the same manner is the mind assisted or en-' dangered by the passions; reason must then take the' place of pilot, and can never fail of securing her charge
if she be not wantin- to herself; the strength of tlhe'passions will never be accepted as an excuse for complying with them: they were desig'ned for subjection;' and if a imanl suflfers them  to get the upper hand, he
then betrays the liberty of Iiis own soul.
7.' As inature has fiamed the several specics of bein;s' as it were in a chain, so man seems to be placed as the' middle link betwe-en angels and brutes; hence lie parti-' cipates both of flesh and spirit by an admirable tye, which'in him occasions perpetual war of passions; and as a
man inclines to tlhe angelic or brute part of his constitution, lie is then deniominatod good or bad, virtuous or
wvicked: if love, mercy, and good-nature prevail, they'speak him of the angel; if hatred, cruelty, and envy
predominate, they declare his kindred to the biute.
8.' Heace it wIas that some ancients imagined, that as
men in this life incline more to the angel or the brute, so
after their death they should transmigrAt inito the one
or the other; a.ld it would be no unpleasant notion to
consider the several species of brutes, into which we
may imagine that tyrants, misers, the proud, malicious,'and ill-natured, might be changed.
9.' As a consequence of this original, all passions are' i all men, but appear not in all: constitution, education, custom of the country, reason, and the like causes'may improve or abate the strength of themn, bult stilland English 7Teacher's Assistant.    9's
ithe seeds remain, which are ever ready to sprout forth
upon the least encouragement.
10.' I have heard a story of a good religious man, who
having been bred with the milk of a goat, was very mo-' dest in public, by a careful reflection he made on his actions, but he frequently had an hour in secret, wherein lie'had his frisks and capers; and, if we had an opportunity
of examining the iretirement of the strictest philosophers,
no doubt but we should find perpetual returns of those
passions they so artfully conceal from the public.
11.' I remember Machiavel observes, that every state
c should entertain a perpetual jealousy of its neighbours,
that so it should never be unprovided when an emergency
happens; in like manner should reason be perpetually'on its guard against the passions, and never suffer them'to carry on any design that may be destructive of its se-'curity; yet, at the same time, it must be careful, that it' don't so far break their strength as to render them contemptible, and, consequently, itself unguarded.
12.' The understanding being of itself too slow and lazy
to exert itself into action, it is necessairy it should be put in
4 motion by the gentle gales of passion, which may preserve
~ it from stagnation and corruption; for they are necessary
to the help of the mind, as the circulation of the animal'spirits is to the health of the body; they keep it in life, and'strength and vigour: nor is it possible for the mind to perform its offices without their assistance; these motions
are given us with our being: they are little spirits,that are' born and die with us; to some they are mild, easy and gentle; to others wayward and unruly; yet never too strong
for the reins of reason, and the guidance ofjudgment.
13.' We may generally observe a pretty nice proportion
between the strength of reason ard passion; the greatest
4 geniuses have comrmonly the strongest affections, ason the' other hand, the weaker understandings have generally' the weaker passions: and'tis fit the fury of the coursers
4 should not be too great for the strength of the charioteer.
14.'Young men, whose passions are not a little unru4 ly, give small hopes of their being considerable; the fire'of youth will of course abate, and is a fault, if it be a fault,' that mends every day; but surely, unless a man has fire
4in youth, he can hardly have warmth in old age.
1296     The Yuc, Gu,- Crnl1'ncz and Lady's'Monitor,
15.' W,'e must therefore be very cautious, lest w';ilk we
I think to regulate the passicns, we should quite extinguish
I them; which is putting out the light of the soul; for to'be without passion, or to be hurriedl aNway with it, makes
a man equally blind. The extraor(dinary severity used
6 in most of our schools has this fatal effect; it breaks the'spring of the imind, and most certainly destroys niore
good geniuses than it can possibly improve.
16.' And surely'tis a mighty mistake that the passions'should be so entirely subdued; for little irregularities'are sometimes not only to be borne with, but to be cultivated too, since they are frequently attended with the
greatest perfections. All great geniuses have faults'mixed with their virtues, and resemble the flaming bush
which has thorns amongst lights.
17.' Since therefore the passions are the principles of
human actions, we must endeavour to manage them  so'as to retain their vigour, yet keep them  under strict
command; we must govern tkem rather like free sub-' jects than slaves, lest while we intend to make them obe-'dient, they become abject, and unfit for those great pur.
poses to which they were designed.
18.' For my part I must confess, I could never have
any regard to that sect of philosophers, who so much in.' sisted upon an absolute indifference and vacancy from
all passion; for it seems to me a thing very inconsistent
for a man to divest himself of humanity, in order to aci quire tranquility of mind, and to eradicate the very principles of action, because it is possible they may produce
ill effects.

77te Advcrntages of irepresenting Htuman Nrature itz its
proper Dignity.
TATLER, NO. 198.
IT is not to be imagined how great an effect well-disposed lights, with proper forms, and orders in assemblies,
haxe upon some temper. I apw wure I feel it in so cxtlsxc1nd2 Englishl TeacherI's Assistant.  97
ordinary a manner, that I cannot:in a day or two get out
of my imagination any very beautiful or disag'reeable impression which I receive on such occasions. For this
reason I frequently look in at the play-house, in order to
enlarge my thoughts, and warm my mind with some new
ideas, that may be serviceable to me in my lucubrations,
1. In this disposition I entered the theatre the other day,
and placed myself in a corner of it, very convenient for
seeing, without being myself observed. I found the audience hushed in a very deep attention, and did not question but some noble tragedy was just then in its crisis, or
that an incident was to be unravelled which would deter-'
mine the fate of an hero. WVhile I was in this suspense,
expecting every moment to see my old friend Mor. Bitterton appear in all the majesty of distress, to my unspeakable amazement, there came up a monster with a face between his feet; and, as I was looking on, he raised himself on one leg in such a perpendicular posture, that the
other grew in a direct line abovre his head.
2. It afterwards twisted itself into the motions and
wreathings of several different animals, and, after great
variety of shapes and transformations, went of the stage
in the figure of a human creature. The admiration, the
applause, the satisfaction of the audience, during this
strange entertainment, is not to be expressed. I was ve-:ry much out of countenance for my dear countrymen, and
looked about with some apprehension, forfear any foreigner
should be present.
3. Is it possible, thought I, that human nature can re-:joice in.its disgrace, and take pleasure in seeing its own
figure turned into ridicule, and distorted into forms that
-raise horror and aversion? There is something disingenuous and immoral in the being able to bear such a sight.
Men of elegant and noble minds are shocked at the seeing
characters of persons who deserve esteem for their virtue,
knowledge, or services to their country, placed in wrong
lights, and by misrepresentations made the subject of buffoonery.
4. Such a nice abhorrence is not, indeed, to be found
among the vulgar; but methinks it is wonderful, that,those, who have nothing but the outward figure to distinguish them as men, shoul~l delight in seeing it abused,
~itified  and disgraCcdoThe Young qGewdeman and Lady's Monitor,
I must confess thers is nothing that more pleases me,
in all that I read in books, or see among mankind, than
such passages as represent human nature in its proper
dignity.
5. As man is a creature made up of different extremes,
lhe has something in him very great and very mean: a skilful artist may draw an excellent picture of him in either
of these views. The finest authors of antiquity have
taklen him on the more advantageous side.'They cultivate the natural grandeur of the soul, raise in her a generous ambition, feed her with hopes of immortality and
perfection, and do all they can to widen the partition between the virtuous and the vicious, by making the difference betwixt -them as great as between gods and brutes.
6. In short, it is impossible to read a page in Plato, Tully, and a thousand other ancient moralists, without being
a greater and a beiter nman for it. On the contrary, I could
never read any of our modish French authors, or those of
our own country who are the imitators and admirers of
that trifling nation, without being for some time out of
humour with nmyself, and at every thing about me.
7. Their business is, to depreciate human nature, and
consider it under its worst appearances. They give mean
interpretations and base motives to the worthiest actions;
they resolve virtue and vice into constitution. In short,
they endeavoVir to make no distinction between man and
man, or between the species of men and that of brutes.
As an instance of this kind of authors, among many others,
let any one examine the celebrated Rocliejbucault, who is
the great philosopher for administering of consolation to
ihe idle; the envious, and worthless parts of mankind.
8. I remenher a young gentleman of moderate understanding, but great vivacity, who, by dipping into many
authors of this nature, had got a little smattering of knowle(lge, just enough to make an atheist or a free thinker, but
not a philosopher or a man of sense. With these accomplishments, he went to visit his father in the country, who
was a plain, rpugh, honest man, and wise though not learned. The son, who took all opportunities to shew his learn.,
ing, began to establish a new religion in the family, and
to enlarge the narrowness of their country notions; in
which he succeeded so well, that he had seduced the butler.by his table talk, nid stagpred hi-e:dle,st sister.and Exglish Teacher's Assistant.
9. The old gentleman began to be alarmed at the schisms
that arose among his children, but did not vet believe his
son's doctrine to be so pernicious as it really was, till one
day talking of his setting-dog, the son said he did not
question but Trey was as immortal as aiinyv one of the
family; and in the heat of the argument told his father,
that for his own part he expected to die like a dog. Upon which the old gentlemall, starting up in a very great
passion, cried out,'hllen, sirrah, you shall live like one;
and taking his cane in his hand, cudgeled him out of his
system. Thij had so good an effect upon him, that he
took up from that day, fell to reading good books, and is
now a bencher in the Aliddle Temple.
10. I do not mention this cudgeling part of the story
with a design to engage the secular arm in matters of this
nature; but certainly, if it ever exerts itself in affairs of
opinion and speculation, it ought to do it on such shallow
and despicable pretenders to knowledge, who endeavour
to give man dark and uncomfortable prospec s of his being, and destroy those principles which are the support,
hIappiness, alndl glory of all public societies, as well as pri.
vate persons.
11. I tlhink it is one of Pythlagoras' s golden sayings, that
a man sazould tak/e care above all thbiz,s to have a due resfiect
fcor himzself; and it is certain, that this licentious sort of
authors, who are for depreciating mankind, endeavrour to
disappoitnt and undo what the most reeSned spirits lhave
been labouring to advance silnce' tie beginnin gof the world.

and science that contributes to the embeiishnient of life,
and to the wearinlg off and throwing into shades the mean
and low parts of oiui natuie.
12. Poetry carries on this great end more than all the
rest, as may,)e seen in the followving passages taken out
of Sir Frauncz.is Baconz's.Advancemlent of' Learning, wvhich
gives a true and better account of this art than all the
volumes that were ever wvritten upon it.
" Poetry, especially heroical, seems to be raised altoge" ther from a noule fotindation, wll;ich lnmakes mlluch for tihe
99100   The Young Gentleman and Laxdy's Monitor,
" dignity of man's nature. For seeing this sensible world
" is in dignity inferior to the soul of man, poesy seems
"to endow human nature with that which history denies;
" and to give satisfaction to the mind, with at least the
"' shadow of things, whe re the substance cannot be had.
13. " For if the matter be thoroughly considered, a
" strong arguiment may be drawn from poesy, that a more
"stately greatness of things, a more perfect order, and a
" more beautiful varietv, delights the soul of man thian
any way can be found in nature since the fall. lVrhere"fore, seeing the acts and events, which are the subjects
" of true history, are not of that amplitude as to content
" the mind of man, poesy is ready at hand to feign acts
( more lheroical.
14.. " Bcause true history reports the successes of busi" ness not proportionable to the merit of virtues and vices,
"' poesy corrects it, and presents events and fortunes ac-'cording to desert, and according to the law of Provi" dence: because true history, through the frequent satie"ty and similitude of things, works a distaste and misprision in the mind of Inan; poesy cheerethl and re"fresheth the soul, chanting things rare and various, and
" full of vicissitudes.
15. " So as poesy serveth and conferreth to delectation,
"magnanimity and mor-ality; and therefore it may seem
" deservedly to have some participation of divineness,be4" cause it doth raise the mind, and exalt the spirIit with
" high raptures, proportioning the shew'v of things to the
"t desires of the mind, and not submitting the mind to
"things as reason anld history do. And by these allure-'mentu and conigruities, whereby it cherisheth the soul
of man, joiied also with concert of music, whereby it
" may more swveetly insinuate itself; it hath won sucl
" access, that it hath been in estimation, even in rude
"times, among barbarous nations, when our learning
" stood excluded."
16. But there is nothing which favours and falls in with
this natural greatness and dignity of human nature so much
as religion, which does not only promise the entire refinement of the mind, but the glorifying of the body, and the
immortality of both.ffnc? English Teacher's Assistant.
CuZstom a Second 2Aature.
I. THERE is not a cominmon saying which has a better
turn of sense in it tih.an what we often hear in the mouths
of the vulgar, that C(ustsm i3 a second Nature. It is indeed able to form the mnan anew- and give him inclinations
and capacities altogether different from those he was born
witih.
2. Dr. Plot, in his history of Staflordhire, tells of an
idiot, that chancing to live within the sound of a clock,
an(l always nmusing himself witli counting the houl of
the day whenever tile clock struck: the clock being spoiled by some accident, the idiot continiiedl to strike and
count the hour without the help of it, in the same manner
as he had done when it was entire.
3. Though I dare not vouch for the truth of this story,
it is very certain that custom has a mechanical effect upon the body, at the same time that it has a very extraordinary influence upon the mnind.
4. 1 shall in this paper consider one very remarkable
effect which custom has upon human nature; and whiclh,
if rightly observed, may lead us into very useful rtlles of
life. What I shall here take notice of in custom, is its
swonderlffl efficacy in making every thing pleasant to us.
5. A person who is addlicted to play or gaming, though
he took but little delight in it at first, by degrees contracts
so strong an inclination towards it, and gives himself up
so entirely to it, that it seems the only end of his being.
The love of a retired or busy life will grow upon a m:;n
insensibly, as he is conversant in the one or the other,
till he is utterly unqualified for relishing that to which he
has been for some time disused.
6. Nay, a man may smoke or drink, or take snuff, till
he is unable to pass away his time without it; not to men,
tion how our delight in any particular study, art, or science) rises and improves in proportion to the application
which we bestow upon it. Thus what was at first an exercise, becomes at length an entertainment. Out employments are changed into diversions. The mind grows fond
of those actions it is accustomed to, and is drawn with reluctancy from those paths in which it has been used to walk.
7. Not oinly such actions as were at first indi-fferent to
I0!102   The Yountg Gentleman and Lady's lMonitor,
us, but even such as were painful, will by custom and prac.
tice become pleasant.
8. Sir Franzcis Bacon observes in his natural philosophy,
that our taste is never better pleased than with those things
which at first create a disgulst in it. He gives palrticular instances of claret, coffee, and other liquors; which the palate seldom approves upon the first taste: but when it has
once got a relishl of them, generally retains it for life. The
mind is constituted after the same manner, and after having habituated itself to any particular exercise or employment, not only loses its first aversion towarcs it, but conceives a certaiii fondness and affection for it.
9. I have heard one of the greatest genuises this age has
produced, hlho had been trained up in all the polite studies of antiquity, assure me, upon his being obliged to
setarch into several rolls and records, that notwithstanding
such an employment was at first very dry and irksome to
him, he at last took an incredible pleasure in it, and preferred it even to the reading of Virgil or cicero.
10. The reader w-ill observe that I have not here considered custom as it makes things easy, but as it renders
them delightful; and though others have often made the
same reflection, it is possible they may not have drawn
those uses firom it, with which I intend to fill the remaining part of this paper.
1 1. If Nwe considler attentively this property of human rature, it may iiistruct us in very fine moralities. In the
first place, I would have no man discouraged w-ith that kind
of life or series of actions, in which the choice of others or
his own necessities may have engaged him. It may perhaps be very disagreeable to himn at first; but use and application will certainly render it not only less painful, but
pleasing and satisfactory.
12. In the second place, I would recommend to every
one the admirable precept w%hich Pythagora,s is said to have
given to his disciples, and which that philosopher must
have drawn from the obstrvation I have enlarlged upon: Op1timum vite gelzus eligito, 7lam cO?Tsu( tudo Jacict jut undissimum. Pitch upon that course of life %which is the most
excellent, and custom will render it the most delightful.
1 3. Men, -hose ci-cumstances will permitthem to choose
lUeir own way of life, are inexcusable if they do not purer.tz An gfih Teacher's Assistant.    103
sue that which their judgment tells them is the most laudable. The voice of ireason is more to be regarded than the
bent of any present inclination, since.by the rule abovementioned, inclination wvill at lengtl conme   over to treason,
though we can never force r'eason to comply with inclination.
14. In the third place, this observation may teacli the
most sensllal and irreligious man to overlool those hardships and difficulties, which ale apt to discollrlA'gre hilri
from the prosecutioj of a virtuous life. The Goits, sai(d
Hes. iod, have placed labour before virtue; the way to her
is at first rough and difficult, but grows more smooth and
easy, the further you advance in it. The man who proceeds in it, with steadiness and resoltution, will in a little
time find that her ways are ways of pleasantness, and
that all her paths are peace.
15. To enforce this consideration, we may fuirther ob.
serve, that the practice of religion wvill not only be attended with that pleasure which naturally accompanies those
actions to which we are habituated, but with those supernumerary joys of heart, that rise firom the consciousness
of such a pleasure, firom the satisfaction of acting uip to the
dictates of reason, and frolll the prospect of an happy
inmmortality.
16. In the fourth place, we may learn from this observation which we lhave made on the mind of nran, to take
particular care, when we are once settled in a regular
course of life, how we too frecluently intlulge ourselves
in any of the most innocent diversions and entertainments,
since the mind may insensibly fall off from the relish of
virtuous actions, and by degrees, exclhange that pleasure
which it takes in the performance of its dtlty, for delights
of a much more inferior and unprofitable nature.
17. The last use which I shall make of tlis rernarkable
property in human nature, of being delighted witlh those
actions to which it is accustomed, is to shew how absolute.
ly necessary it is for us to gain habits of virtue in this life.
if we iw-ould enjoy the pleasures of the next.
18. The state of bliss we call heaven, will not be capable of affecting those miilds, which are not thus qualified
for it: we must in this world gain a relish of truth and virtue, if we would be able to taste that knowlcedge and perK7;d   i   7ii;  JI7-'c-aciche's   Asis tant.

is alloweved by every one to be short, the several divisions
of it appear to be l!ng and tedious.

would fain contract the parts of wvlhich it is coinposed.
The usurer wA,oui(l hbe very well satisfied to have all the
time annihila.ted that lies between the present moment
and next ruat'ter day.  The politician- would be content,
eed to loose three years of his life, could be place things
int the postulre tlwhichl he fancies they vill stand in after
such a revolution of timle.
4. The lover wol-!d be glad to strike out of Ihis existonce all the.moments that are to pass away before the
happy meeting.   Thln us, au s fa'r a otr time rluns, we
should be very glad in most parts of otlr lives, that it ran.much faster than it does.  Several liours of the day
lang upon our lhandcs, nav,  e wish away wvhole years,and travel throulgh time as through a country filled vith
many wildd and emipty wvastes which we'wo-ld fain hurry
over, that we may arrive at those sevXeral little settle..ments or imag.ilnary points of rest, wlich are dispersed
lip and' down in it.
5, If we may divide thie'life of monit men into t wenty
parts, we shall find, that at least nineteen of tihem are
mnere gaps and chasms, iwhiich are neither filed with
pleasurie nor business.-- I do not hovwever include in this
calculation the life of those mlen who are in a perpetual
hurry of affairs, but of those only who are not alwaONys
engaged in scenes of action: and I hope I shall not clo
an unacceptable piece of service to those persons, if I
point out to them certain methods for the filling up their
empty spaces of life. The methods I shall propose to
them are as follow:     -
6. The fi,st is the exercise of virtue, in the most general acceptation of the word. That particular scheme
which comprehends the social virtules, may give. employmenlt to the most industrious temper, and find a
mlan in business imore than the most active station oflife.

fection which are to make us happy in the next. The
seeds of those spiritual joys and raptures, which are to rise
up and flourish in the soul to all eternity, must be plantedl
in it, during this its present state of plobation. In short,
heaven is not to be looked upon only as the reward, but
as the natural effect of a religious life.
19. On the other hand, those evil spirits, who by long
custom, have contiracted in the body, habits of lust, scnsuality, rilalice and revenge, an av-ersion to everyv thing that
is good, just, or1 laudable, are naturally seasonedc and prepared for pain and mnisery. Their torments have alreadly.
taken root in them; they cannot be happy whendivested
of the body, unless wve may suppose, that Providence
will in a manner create them anew, and work a miracle
in the rectification of their faculties.
20. They may, indeed, taste a kind of malignant pleasure in those actions to which they are accustomed wrhilst
in this life; but when they are removed from all those
objects which are here apt to gratify them, they will naturally become their own tormentors, and cherish in

21. This notion of heaven and hell is so very conformable to the light of nature, that it was discovered bv several of the most exalted heathens. It has been fine}y
improved by many eminent divines of the last age, as in
particular by Archbishop T7'l1otson and Dr. Sherlock; but
there is none who has riaised such noble speculations upon
it as Dr. Scott, in the first book of his Christian Life, which
is one of the finest and most rational schemes of dix iniitv,
that is written in our tongue or any other. That excellenit
author has shewn how every particular custom andi habit
of virtue will, in its own nature, produce the heaveni, or a
state of happiness) in him whci shall hereafter practise it:
as on the contrary, how every custom  or habit of vice
will be the natural hell of him in wlhom it subsists.
On C'lea/liiness.
SPECTATOR, NO. 631.
1. I HAD occasion to go a few miles out of town, some
days since, in a stage-coach, where I had for nmy fellowand EEnglish Teac-her's Assistant.   105
travellers, a dirty beau, and a pretty young Quaker wonan. Having no inclination to talk mnuch at that time,
I placed my-self bckward, with a design to survey them,
and pick a speculation out of mn two companions. Their
(lifferent figures were sufifcient ofthemselves to draw my
atteianton.
2. T'lhe gentlemanl was dressed in a suit, the ground
-thercof had bc nli black, as I perceived fron some few
spaces thalt ht.d escaped tilt pov-ider, wlhich -was incorporated with the,:rcatest part of his' coat; hIis pcriwig,

cast over hlis shoulders, that it seemed not to have been
combed since the yeai 1712; his linen, which was not much
concealed, was daubed with plain Spanish from the chin to
the lowest button, and the diamond upon his finger (which
naturally dreaded the water)putme in mindhow itsparkled
amidst the rubbish of the mine where it was first discovered.
3. Oil the other hand, the pretty Quaker appeared in all
the elegance of cleanliness. Not a speck was to be found
on her. A clear, clean, oval face, just edged about with
little thin plaits of the purest cambrick, received great advantages from the shade of her black hood: as did the
vwhliteness of ier arlms fiom tllat sober-coloured stuff in
which she had clothed herself. The plainness of her dress
was very well suited to the simplicity of her phrases, all
vyhich put together, though they could not give me a
great opirion of her ieli-i gin, they did of her innocence.
4. This adventure occasioned imy throwing together a
few hints upon clea?;iines, which I shall consider as one
of the half virtues, is:riistolc calls them, and shall recommend it under the three following heads: As it is a mark
of politeness; as it produceth love; and as it b-ars analogy to purity of mind.
5. First, it is a mark of politeness. It is universally
agreed upon, thlat no one, unadorrned with this virtue, cat.
go into compalnr)y without giving a manifest offence. The
asiier or hilgher any one's fortune is, this duty rises
proportionably. The different nations of the world are as
much distinguished by theilr cleanliness, as by their alts
and sciences. Thle iimore any country is civilized, tlhe more
they consult this part of politeness. W\e need but compare
ourl ideas of a female Hottentot with an IEnglia/z beauty, to
be satisfied with.:t1l trith of dwhat lhath been advanced.106   TYle Y~oung C-ctneman and Lady's Moinitor,
6. In the next p-lace, cleanliness may be said to be the
foster-mother of lovc. Beauty, indeed, most commonly
produces that pzassion in the mind, but cleanliness preserves it. An indifferent face and person, kept in per.
petual neatness, hath won many a heart from a pretty slattern. A-ige itself is not unamiable, whlile it is preserved
clean and unsullied: like a piece of metal constantly kept
smooth aild brig!t, vwe look on it with more pleasure than
on a new vessel that is cankered with rust.
7. I miglht observe further, that as cleanliness renders
us agreeable toothers, so it imakes it easy to ourselves; that
it is a.n excellent preservative of health; and that several
vices, destructive both to mind and body, atre inconsistent'ith the habit cf it. Bilt these reflections I shall leave to.the leisure of my readers, aind shall observe in the third
place, that it bears a'".;.-t analogy with purity of mind,
and natur-a.y, inlsies -re5ied sentiments and passions.
8. \Ve firnd, firom experience, that through the prevalence of custom, the most vicious actions lose their horror, by bein. madle fruniliar to us. On the contrary, those
who live in the neg,l boulnhood of good examples, fly from
-the first appearanrees of what is shocking. It fares with
us much after the same manner as out' ideas. Our senses, which are the inlets to all the images conveyed to the
minid, call onlyl transmit the impression of such things as
usually surround tllem; so that pure and unsullied
thoughts are naturall) sug.gested to the minld, by those
objects that perpetually encompass us, when they are
beautiful and elegant in their kind.
9. In the East, where the warmth of the climates makes
cleanliness more immediately necessary than in colder
countries, it is made one part of their religion; the Jewish law (anld the Mahom etan, which, in some things,- copies after it) is filled with lxathings, purifications, and other
rites of the like nature. Though there is the abo-e niamed
conveniknt reason to be assigned for these ceremonies, the
chief intention, undoubtedly, was to typify inward purity
and cleanliness of heart by those outward washings.
10. W e read several injunctions of this kind in the boolk
of Deuteronomy, which confilrns this truth, land which are
but ill accounted for by saying, as some do, that they
were only instituted for convenience in the desert, which
otherways could not have been hfabitably foi so many yeara,and English Teache;'s Assistant.    107
1 1. I shall conclude this essay wivith a story which I have
some where recad in an account of Mahometan superstition. A dervise of g;reat sanctity one morninig l:ad the
misfortune, as he took tip a crystal cup, which was colsecrated to the prophet, to let it fall upon thle grounl aI-d
dash it in pieces. His son coniing in some time after,
lie stretched out his hand to bless him, as his maniner was
everiy morning; but the youth going out. stuniblzd over
the thleshold and broke his arnm. As the old liman w-ionclered at those events, a caravan passed by in its way
fronm.lfcca.'lThe dervise approached it to beg a blessing; but as he stroked one of the holy caniels, he receiv--
ed a kick from the beast, that sorely bruised him. Ifis
sotrow aiind amazement increased upon him, till he recollected, that, through hurry and iiiadvertency, he had
that mor;ing come abroad without washing his hands.
The Advantages of a good Educatio,s.
I. I CONSIDER a human soul without education'lkc,
marble in the quarr, which shews none of its inherent
beauities, until the skill of the polisher fetclies out thie
colours, makes the surface shine, and (liscovers every ornamental cloud, spot and vein, that runs through the body
of it. Education, after the same manner,,h'len it works
upon a noble mind, dra-ws out to view every latent virtue
aind perfettion, which, without such helps, are never~ able
to make their appearance.
2. If my reader will give me leave to chan-e the Jllusion so soon upon him, I shall make'use of the same instance to illustrate the force of education, w,h'ich.Ariisteic
has broulght to explain his doctrinle of substantial forms,
wvhen he tells us that a statue lies hid in a lblock of nma:'hle; and that the art of the statuary only clears a-;,ay the
superfluous nmatter, and removes the rubbishl. rThli  figure is in the stone, the scullptor on)ly finds it.', hlat sculpture is to a block of marble, education is to an lhun-an soul.
$. The philosopher, the s4int, or the hlero, tihe wise,
the good, or the great man, -ery often lie hid and concealed in a plebeian, which a prbper education mighIt have
disinterred, and have brought to lig-ht. I am therefore
much dlighted with reading the accounts of sa,vage naK2IL"   The You.;g Gentlet.an and Lady's Monitor.
tions, and with contemplating those virtues which are
wild and uncultivated; to see courage exerting itself in
fierceness, resolution in obstinacy, wisdom in cunning,
patience in sullenness and despair.
4. Men's passion!s operate variously, and appear in different kinds of actions, according as they are more or less
rectified or swayed by reason. When one hears of negroes, who upon the death of their masters, or upon changing their service, hang themselves upon the next tree, as
it frequently happens in our American plantations, who
can forbear admiring their fidelity, though it expresses
itself in so dreadful a manner?
5. What might not that savage greatness of soul which
appears in these poor wretches on many occasions, be raised to, were it rightly cultivated? And what colour of
excuse can there be for the contempt with which we treat
this part of our species? that we should not put them
upon the common foot of humanity; that we should only
set an insignificant fine upon the man who murders them;
nay, that we should, a's much as in us lies, cut them off
fromn the prospect of happiness in alipther world, as well
as in this, and deny them that which we look upon as
the proper means for attaining it.
6. It is therefore an unspeakabie blessing to be bsrn in
those parts of the world where wisdom and knowledge
flourish, thoulgh it must be confessed there are, even in
these parts, several poor uninstructed persons, who are
but little above the inhabitants of those nations of which
I have been here speaking; as those who have had the
advantages of a more liberal education, rise above one
another by several different degrees of perfection.
7. For, to return to our statue in the block of marble,
-we see it sometimes only begun to be chipped, sometimes
wough hewn, and but just sketched into an human figure;
sometimes we see the man appearing distinctly in all his
limbs and features, sometimes we find the figure wrought
up to a great elegancy, but seldonm meet with any to which
the hand of Phidias or Pr.xitele- could not give several
nice touches and finishings.and Ent?'Ush reacher's Assistant.   I09
The Disadvanta,ges of a bad Education.
SIR,
1. I W'AS condemned by some disa~treus influence to
be an only son, born to the apparent prospect of a large fortune, and allotted to my parents at that time of life when satiety of common diversions allows the mind to indulge
parental affection with great intenseness. My birth was
celebrated by the tenants with feasts and dances and bagpipes; congratulations were sent from every family within
ten miles round; and my parents discovered in my first
cries such tokens of future virtue and understanding, that
they declared themselves determined to devote the remaining part of life-to my happiness and the increase of
their estate.
2;-The abilities of my father and mother were not perceptibly unequal, and education had given neither much
advantage over the other. They had both kept good
company, rattled in chariots, glittered in play-houses,
and danced at court, and were both expert in the games
that were in their times called in as auxiliaries against
the intrusion of thought.
3. W'hen there is such aparity between two persons associated for life, the dejection which the husband, if he be
hot completely stupid, must always suffer for want of superiority, sinks him to submissiveness. My mamma
therefore governed the fanmily without control; and except that my father still retained some authority in the stables, and now and then, after a supernumery bottle, broke a
looking-glass, or china-dish, to prove his sovereignty, the
Whole course of the year was regulated by her direction;
the servants received from her all their orders, and the tenants were continued or dismissed at her discretion.
4. She therefore thought herself entitled to the superintendance of her son's education; and when my father, at
the instigation of the parson, faintly proposed that I should
be sent to school, very positively told him, that she would
not suffer so fine a child to be ruined: that she never knew
any boys at a grammar-school that could come into a room
without blushing, or set at the table without some aukward
uneasiness; that they were ahlays pitting themselves into
dangerby boisterous plays, or vitiating their behaviour withtI0   Tfte Young Gentleeman and _Lady's Monito:,
mTnean company; and that for lier part, she would rat her
follow me to the grave than see me tear my clothes, and
haing down my head, and sneak about wvith dirty shloes and
blotted fingers,mny hairl unpowdered, and my hat uncocked.
5.,ly father, who had no other end in his proposal than
to appear wise and manly, sowl acquiesced, since I was
not to live by my learning; for indeed he had known ve ry
few students that had not some stiffness in their manner.
Tihey thlerefore aSgreed that a domestic tutor should be
procured, and hired an lionest gentlemlan of mean conversation and narrow sentiments, but whlo having passed
the common forms of literary education, they implicitly
concluded qualified to teach all that wvas to be learned
from a scholar. He thought himself sufficiently exalted
by being placed at the same table with his pupil, and had
no other view than to perpetuate his felicity by the utmost
flexibility of submission to all my mother's opinions and
caprices. He frequently took away my book, lest I should
mrope with too much application, clarged nie never to
write without turning up my ruffles, and generally brushed my coat before he dismissed me into the narlour.
6. He had no occasion to complain of too burthensome
an employinent; for my mother velry judiciously considered that I was not likely to grow politer in his company, and suffered me not to pass any more time in his apartment, than my lesson required. WVhen I was summoned
to my task, she enjoined me not to get any of my tutor's
ways, who was seldom Inentioled before me but for practices to be avoided. I was every moment admonished
not to lean on my chair, cross my legs, or swing my hands
like my tutor; and once my mother very seriously deliberated upon his total dismission, because I began, said
she, to learn his manner of sticking on my hat, and had
his bend in my shoulders, and his totter in my gait.
7. Such, howevel, was her care, that I escaped all these
depravities, and when I was only twelve years old, had rid
myself of every appearance of childish diffidence. I was
celebrated round the country for the petulence of my remariks, and the quickness of my replies; and many a
scholar five years older than myself, have I dashed into
confusion by the steadiness of my countenance, silenced
by my rqdin~ess of repartee, and tortured w-ith envy byand Engl'sh Teacher's Assistant.
the addresswith which I picked up a fan, presented a snuffbox, or received an empty tea-cup.
8. At fourteen I was completely skilled in all the niceties
of dress, and I could not only enumerate all the variety
of silks, and distinguish the product of a French loom, but
dart my eye through a numerous company, and observe
every deviation from the reigning mode. I was universally skilful in all the changes of expensive finery; but as
every one, they say, has something to which he is particularly born, was eminently known in Brussels lace.
9. The next year saw me advanced to the trust and
power of adjusting the ceremonial of an assembly. All
received their partners from my hand, and to me every
stranger applied for introduction. My heart now disdained the instructions of a tutor, who was rewaided with a
small annuity for life, and left me qualified, in rny own
opinion, to govern myself.
10. In a short time I came to London, and as my father
was well known among the higher classes of life, soon
obtained admission to the most splendid assemblies, and
most crowded card-tables. Here I found myself univerall1y caressed and applauded, the ladies praised the fancy
of my clothes, the beauty of my form, and the softness of
my voice; endeavoured in every place to force themselves
to my notice; and invited, by a thousand oblique solicitations, my attendance at the play-house, and my salutations
in the park. I was now happy to the utmost extent of my
conception; I passed evexry morning in dress, every afternoon in visits, and every night in some select assemblies,
where neither care nor knowledge were suffered to molest
us.
1 1. After a few years, however, these delights became
familiar, and I had leisure to look roulnd me with more
attention. I then found that my flatterers had very little
power to relieve the languor of satiety, or recreate weariness by varlied amusement; and therefore endeavolured to
enlarge the sphere of my pleasures, and to try what satisfaction might be found in the society of men. I will not
deny the mortification.with which I perceived that every
man whose name I had lheard raentioned -ith respect,
received me with a kind of tenderness nearly bordering
Qn coIpl)assion; and that thQse whose reputation was!ot
III112   ~r,e'Yourg Genthc,cnzz aud Lady's Monitor,
well established, thought it necessary to justify ticeir tInderstanidings, by treating me with contempt. One of
these wvitii'ils el-vated his crest by a.skinlg mle in a full
coffee-house the price of patches; and another whispered,
that he wondered MIiss Frisk did not keep me that afternoona to'&amp;-a;tch her squirriel.
12. Vhen I foiund myself thus hunted from all masculine conver!saticn by those w ho were thlenisclve:i barely
admitted, I xeturnicd to the ladies, and resolved to delicate
my life to their service and their pleasure. - But I[find that
1 i,ve now lost my charmns. Of ths-, ith -whom I entered the gay world, some are married, some have retired,
and sompe have so much changed their opinion, that they
scarcely pay any regard to my civilities, if there is any
other man in the place. l'ihe new flight of beauties to
whom I have made nmy addresses, suffer me to pay the
treat, and then titter with boys: So that I now find myself welcome only to a few grave ladies, who,unacquailnted
with all that gives either use or dignity to life, are content to pass their hour: between their bed and their carlds,
without esteem from the old, or reverence fiom the young.
13. I cannot but dinak, Mr-. R'ambler, that I hare reason to complain; for surely the females ought to pay some
regard to the age of him whose youth was passed in endeavoulring to please them. They that encourage folly in
the boy, have no right to punish it in the nian. Yet I
find, that though they lavish their first fondness upon pertness and gaiety, they soon transfer their regard to other
qualities, and ungratefully abandon their adorers to dream
out their last years in stupidity and contempt.

Learning, a necessary Accomplishment in a Tor.,an of.urjality or Fortune.
GUARDIAN, No. 155.
1. I ITAVE often wonderecl that learning is not thought
a proper ingredient in thle education of a woman of quuality or fortune. Since they have the same improveable
minds as the male part of the species, why slloulld they
not be ctdtivatet4 by the same m::thod? WVhyr sho,.ld rcaav,d EngliAsh Teaciher's Assistant.  1!
sun be left to itself in one of the sexes, and be disciplinecd
with so mucll care to the other?
2. There arie some reasons wvhy learning seems more
adapted to the female world than to the male. As in the
first place, because they have more spare time upon their
haindls and lead a more sedentary life. Their employments are of a domestic nature, and not like those of the
other sex, which are often inconlsistent with study and
contemplation.
3. The excellent lady, the lady Lizard, in the space of
one summer fuirnished a gallery with chairs and couches
of her own and her dauhllters working; and at the sanme
time heard all Dr. 7'illotson's sermons twice over. It is
always the custom for one of the young ladies to read,
while the others are at v-olk; so that the learning of the
fanily is not at all prejudicial to its manufactures.
4. I was mightily pleased the other day to find them all
bulsy in preserving several fruits of the season, with the
Sparkler in the imidst of them, reading oveIr "The plurality of'Vorlls." It wvas very entertaining to me to see
tihem dividing their speculations betiween iellies and stars,
andc making a suddlen transiticn from the sun to an apricot, or fi-om the Copernicum system to the figure of a
cheese cake.
5. A second reason why women should apply themselves
to useful knou led-e rather than men, is because they have
that natural gift of speech in greater perfection.  Since
they have so excellent a talent, such a Co/ia Verborum, or
plenty of words, it is pity they should not put it to some
use. If the female tongue will be in motion, why should
it not be set to go right? Could they discour:se about the
spots in the sun, it nlight divert them firom publishing the
faults of their neighbours: could they talk of the different
aspects and conjunctions of the planets, they need not be
at the pains to comment upon oglings and clan(lestine
marriages. In short, were they ftlrnished with matters
of fact, out of airts and sciences, it would now and then be
of great ease to their invention.
6. There is another reason why those, especially who
are women of quality, should apply themselves to ltters,:iamely, because their husbands are generally strangers to,
them. It is great pity there should be no knor;ledge in7 21e Young Gentlemnan tiCzd Lady's MIoniitor,
the fierceness of a party; of doing jwtstice to the cllarac*er of a des;rving man; of softening the envious, quieting the angry, and rectifying the prejudiced; which are
all of them employments suited to a reasonable nature,
and bring great satisfaction to the person who canl busy
himself in themn with discretion.
S. There is another kind of virtue that may find employmnnent for those retired hours in which we are altogether left to ourselves, and destitute Of company and- conversation: I mean that intercourse and commnunication
which every reasonable creature ought to maintain with
the great Author of his being.
9. The man who lives under an habitual sense of the
divine presence, -keeps up a perpetual cheerfulness of
temper, and enjoys every moment the satisfaction of
t;hinking himself in company with the dearest and best
of fiiends. The time never lies heavy upon him; it is
impossible for him to be alone.
10. IHis thoughts and passions are the most busied at
such hlours when those of other men are the most inactive; he ino sooner steps out of the world, but his
lheart burns with devotion, swells with hope, and triumpihs in the consciousness of that presence which every where surrounds him; or, on the contrary, poum't out
its fears, its sorrows, its apprehensions, to the great
supporter of its existence.
11. I have here only considered the necessity of a
nan's being virtuous that he may have something to do;
but if we consider further, that the exercise of virtue is
not only an amusement for the time it lasts, but that its
influence extends to those parts of our existence which
lie beyond tl-e grave, and that our whole eternity is to
take its colour friom those hours which we here employ in
virtue or in vice, the argument redoubles upon us, for
putting in practice this method of passing away our time.
12. WVhen a man has but a little stock to improve, and
has opportunities of turning it all to a good account, what
shall we think of him if he suffers ninleteen parts of it to
lie dead, and perhaps employs even the twentieth to his
ruin or disadvantage? But because the mind cannot be
always in its fervour nor strained up to a pitch of virtue,
it is necessary to find out proper' employmenats for it in
its relaxatiolnse114   The Youtgs Gentlema* and Lady's Monitor,
a family. For my own part, I am concerned when I go
into a great house, where perhaps there is not a single
person that can spell, unless it be by chance the butler,
or one of the footmen. What a figure is the young heir
likely to make, who is a dunce both by father and mother's
side?
7. If we look into the histories of famous women, we
find many eminent philosophers of this sex. Nay, we
find that several females have distinguished themselves in
those sects of philosophy which seem alinost repugnant
to their natures. There have been famous female Pythagoriaiz.-, notwithstanding most of that philosophy consiste(l
in keeping a secret, and that the disciple was to hold her
tongue five years together.
8. Learning'and knowledge are perfections in us, not
as we are men, but as we are reasonable creatures, in
which order of beings the female world is upon the same
level with the male. We ought to consider in this particular, not what is the sex, but what is the species to
which they belong. At least I believe every one will
allow me, that a female philosopher is not so absurd a
character, and so opposite to the sex, as a female gamester; and that it is more irrational for a woman to pass
away half a dozen howtrLs at cards or dice, than in getting
up stores of useful learning.
9. This, therefore, is another reason why I would recommend the studies of knowledge to the female world,
that thev may not be at a loss how to employ those hours
that lie heavy upon their hands.
10. I might also add this motive to my fatr readers, that
several of their sex, who have improved their minds by
books and literature, have raised themselves to the highest
posts of hlnour anti fortune. A neighbouring nation may
at this time furnmish us with a very remarkable instance of
this kind: but I shall conclude- this head with the history
of Athenais, which is a very signal example to my present purpose.
11. The Emperor Theodosius being about the age of
one-and-twenty, and designing to take a wife, desired his
sister Pulcheria and his friend Paulinus to search his whole
empire fora womanof the most exqulisite beauty and highest accomplishments. In the mnidst of this search, Atheand Rnglish Teacher's AssiStant.      1 5
nais, a Grecian virgin, accidentally offered herself. Her
father, who was an eminent philosopher of Athens, and
had bredt her up in all the learning of that place, at his
deathl left her but a very snmall portion, in which also she
suffered great hlardshlips from the injustice of her two
brothers.
12. This forced her upon a journley to Constantinople,
where slhe had a relation who represented her case to Pulcheria, in order to obtain some redress from the emperor.
By this means that religious princess became acquainted
with Athenais, whoim she foundI the most beautiful womran
of her age, and educated under a longcolurse of philoso(h)l-y,
in the st rictest virtue and most ulnspotted innocence.
13. Pulcheria was charlmei witll her conversation, and
immediately mnalde her report to thle emiero. hlier brot!lcr'l'heoosius. The char actet she -gave mladel suc'h an impression on him, that he dies.ired his sisteir to brini lher

where lhe olind hc her )eauty and heI conversation bevon-d
the hiighest i.lea he had fram(ed of tl-em.
14. His friend Paillilnus colnverted her- to christianitr,
an(d gave her the name of E.udosia; after whiclh the enmperor publicly espoused her, and enjoyed all thle happiness
in his marriage which he promised himnself fiomni such at

Oni the Absutrdity of Omen3.
SPECTATOR.
1. GOING yesterdav to dine with an old acquaiintance,
I had the misfortune to find the whole family very much
dejected. Upon asking him the occasion of it, he told
me that his wife had dreamed a very-:strange dream the
night before, which they were afraid portenlded some mis.
chief to themselves or to their children. At her comhig
i4to the room, I observed a settled.melancholy in lher counL116   The Young Gentleman and Lady's Monitor,
tenance, which I should have been troubled for, had I not
hleard from whence it proceeded.
2. We were no sooner sat down, but, after having looked upon me a little while,' My dear,' says she, turning to
her husband,' vou may now see the stranger that w-as in'the candle last night.' Soon after this, as they began to
talk of family affairs, a little boy at the lower end of the
tabletold her, that he was to go into joining-hand on ThursdGay-- Thursday!' says she,' no, child, if it please God,' you shall not begin upon Childermas day; tell your writ-' ing-master that Friday will be soon enough.'
3. I was reflecting with myself on the oddness of her
fancv, and wondering that any body would establish it as
a rule to lose a day in every week. In the midst of these
mly musings, she desired me to reach her a little salt uIpon
the point of my knife, which I did in such a trepidation
and hurry of obedience, that I let it drop by the way; at
which she immediately startled, and said it fell towards her.
-Upon which I looked very blank; and, observing the concern of the whole table, began to consider myself, with
some confilsion, as a person that had brought a disaster
upon the family.
4. The lady, however, recovering herself after a little
space, said to her husband w-ith a sigh,' My dear, misforL tunes never come single.' My friend, I found, acted but
an under-part at his table, and being a man of more goodnature than understanding, thinks himself obliged to full
in with all the passions and humours of his yoke-fellow:
Do youi remember, child,' says she,' that the pigeonhouse fell the very afternoon that our careless wench' spilt the salt upon the table?'' Yes,' says he,' my dear,' and the next post brought us an account of the battle of'Almanza.'
5. The reader may guess at the figure I made, after
having done all this mischief. I dispatched my dinner as
soon as I could, with my usual taciturnity; when, to my
utter confusion, the lady seeing me quitting my knife and
fork, and laying across one another upon my plate, desired me that I would humour her so far as to take them out
of that figure, and place them side by side.
6. What the absurdity was which I had committed I
did not know, but I suppose there was some traditionaryand English Teacher's Assistant.   117
superstition in it; and therefore, in obediel:ce to the lady
of the house, I disposed of my knife and fork in two parallel lines, which is a figure I shall always lay them in for
the future, though I do not know any reason for it.
7. It is not difficult to a man to see that a person has
conceived an aversionl to Iiim. For my own part, I quickly
found, by the lady's looks, that she regarded me as a very
odd kind of fellow, with an unfortunate aspect; for which
reason I took my leave immediately after dinner, and withdrew to my own lodgings.
8. Upon my return home, I fell into a profound contenmplation on the evils that attend these superstitious foilisof mankind: how they subject us to imaginary afflictions
and additional sorrows that do not properly coile within
our lot. As if the natural calamities of life were not sufficient for it, we turn the most indifferent circumstances
into misfortunes, and suffer as much from trifling accidents, as fiom real evils.
9. 1 have known the shooting of a star spoil a night':;
rest; and have seen a man in love grow pale and lose his
appetite, upon the plucking of a merry-thought. A screech
owl at midnight has alarmed a family more than a band
of robbers; nay, the voice of a cricket hatli struck more
terror than the roaring of a lion.
10. There is nothing so inconsiderable, which may not
appear dreadful to an imagination that is filled with omens
and pro.nostics. A rusty nail, or crooked pin, shoot up
into prodigies.
11. I rememnber I was once in a mixt assembly, that was
full of noise and mirth, wlien on a sudden an old woman
unluckily observed there were thirteen of us in company.
This remark struck a panic terror into several who were
present, insomuch that one or two of the ladies were going to leave the room; but a friend of mine taking notice.
that oiie of our female companions was big with child, affirmned there were fourteen in the room, and that, insteaul
of porteinding one of the company should die, it plainly
foretold one of them should be born. Had not my friend
found out this expedient to break the omen, I question
not but half the women in the coimpany would have fallen
sick that very night.
12. Au old maid, that is troubled with the vapours,118   The Young Gentleman wrid Lady's Motitor,
produces infinite disturbances of this kinid among hIer
fiiends and neighbours. I know a maiden aunt, of a great
fanlilv, who is one of these antiqutated Sibyls, that fore-bodes and prophesies firom one end of the year to the
otfher. She is always seeing apparitions, and hearing deadwatches; and was the other day almost fiightened out of
her wits by the great house-dog, that howled in the stable at a time when she lay ill of the tooth-ache.
13. Such an extravagant cast of mind engages multitudes of people not only in impertinent terrors, but in supernumerary duties of life; and arises firom that fear and
ignorance which a-re natural to the soul of man.
14.'The horror w-ith which we entertain the thoughts
of deathl (or indeed of any future evil) and the uincertainty
of its approach, fill a melancholy mind with innunmerabl-e
apprehensions and suspicions, anld consequently dispose it
to the observation of such groundless prodigies and predictions. For as it is the chief concern of wsise men, to
retrench the evils of life by the reasonings of philosophy;
it is the employment of fools to multiply them by the sentiirents of superstition.
15. For my own part, I should be -ery much troubledc
were I endowed with this divining quality, though it shouild
inform me truly of every thing that can befal me. I would
not anticipate the relish of any happiness, nor feel the
weight of any misery, before it actually arrives.
16. I know but one way of fortifyiing my soul against
these gloomy presages and terirors of mind; and that is,
by securing to myself the friendship aind protection of that
Being, whko dispioses of events and governs futurity. He
sees, at one view, the whole thread of my existence, not
only that part of it which I have already passed tllhrough,

1A good Conscience the best Security against Cablnlny
and Reproach.
GUARDIAN, NO. 135.
1. A GOOD conscience is to the soul what health qis to
the body; it preserves a constant ease and serenity within
us, and more than countervails all the calamities and afflictions which can possibly befal us. I know nothing so
hard for a generous mind to get over as calumny and reproach, and cannot find any method of quieting the soul
under them, besides this single one, of our being conscious to ourselves that we do not deserve them.
2. I have been always mightily pleased with that passage in Don Quixotte, where the fantastical knight is represented as loading a gentleman of good sense with praises
and eulogiums. Upon which the gentleman makes this reflection to himself: how grateful is praise to hunan natuae!
3. I cannot forbear being secretly pleased with the commendations I receive, though. I am sensible, it is a madman
who bestows them on me. In the same manner, though
we are often sure that the censures which are passed upon
us, are uttered by those who know nothing of us, an(l hav%e
neither means nor abilities to form a right judgment of
us, we cannot forbear being grieved at what they say.
4. In order to heal this infirmity, which is so natural to
the-best and wisest of men, I have taken a particular
pleasure in observing the conduct of the old philosophers,
how they bore themselves up against the malice and detraction of their enemies.
5. The way to silence calumny, says Bias, is to be always exercised in such things as are praise-worthy. &amp;Scrates, after having received sentence, told his friends
that he had always accustomed himself to regard
truth and not censure, and that he was not troubled at his
condemnation, because he knew himself free from guilt.
It was in the same spirit that he heard the accusations of
his two great adversaries, who had uttered against him
the most virulent reproaches.
6. Anytus and MIelitus, says he, may procure senteln,e
against me, but they cannot hurt me. This divine philosopher was so well fortified in his ovwn innocence, that he1
neglected all the irnpotence o-f evil toilgues wh-lic;' h vv
119120   7Th7e loung Gentleman and Lady's Mlonitor,
engaged in his destruction. This was properly the support
of a good conscience, tl:at colltradicted the ireports w hich
had been raise! against him, and cleared him to himself.
7. Ctlhers of the philosop,hers rather-chose to retort the
injury of a smairt reply, than thus to (lisarm it with r espect'to themselves.''hey shew that it stung them, though
at the same time they had the address to make their aggressors suffer with them. Of this kind is Ari.s'otle's reply to one who pursued him with long and bitter invectives. You, says he, who are used to suffer reproaches,
utter them with delight; I who have not been used to
iutter them, take no pleasure in hearing them.
8. Diogenes was still more severe on one wvho spoke
ill of him: nobody will believe you when you speak ill of
me, any more than tley would believe me wvhen I speak
well of you.
In these and many other instances I could plrcducey the
bitterness of the answer sufi;ciently testifies the uneasiness of rmind the person was under who made it.
9. I would rather advise my reader, if he has not in this
case the secret consolation, that lie deserves no such ireproaches as are cast upon him, to follow the advice of
Epictetus: If any one speaks ill of thee, consider whether he has truth on his side; and if so, reform thyself,
that his censures may not af'ect thee.
10. W'hen Anaximander was told that the very boys
laughed at his singing: Ay, says he, then I must learn to
sing better. But of all the sayings of philosophers which
1 have gathered together for my own use on this occasion, there are none which carry in them more dandour
and good sense than the two following ones of Plato.
I 1. Being told that he had many enemies who spoke ill
of him; it is no matter, said he, I will live so that noneshall believe them. Hearing at another time, that an intimate friend of his had spoken detractingly of him, I am
sure he would not do it, says he, if he had not some reason for it.
12.'lThis is the sulrest as well as the r_iblest way of
dra- ing the sting out of a reproach, and a true method
of preparing a man for that great and only relief against
-tbe pains of calumny,' a good conscience.'
13. 1 designed in this essay, to shew, that there is nia.d Engtiqsh Teacher's Assistant.  121
happiness wanting to him who is posszssd of this excellent
fraiae of mind, and that no one can be mniserable who is in
thLe enjoyment of it; but I find this subject so well treatetl
in one of Dr. South's sermons, that I shall fill tilis Saturday's paper with a passage of it, which cannot but make
the man's heart barn within him, who reads it with due
attention.
14. That admirable author, having shewn the virtue of
a good conscience, in suppoorting a man under the greatest trials and difficulties of life, concludes with representing its force an!d efficacy in the hour of death.
15. The third and last instance, in which above all others
this confidence towards God does most eminently shew and
exert itself, is at the time of death; wliich surely gives
the grand opportunity of trving both the strength and
worth of every principle.
16. When a man shall be just about to quit the stage of
this world, to put off his 1mortality, and to (leliver up his
last accounts to God; at which sad time his mnemorv shall
serve him for little els., but to terrify him with a frigiltful review of his past life, and his former ext,ravagancies
stripped of all their pleasure, but retaining their guilt;
what is it then that can promise him a fair passage into
the other world, or a comfortable appearance before his
dreadful Judge when he is there?
17. Not all the friends and interests, all the riches and
honours under heaveni can speak so much as a wordi for
him, or one word of comfort to him in that condition;
they may possibly reproach, but they cannot relieve him.
18. No, at this disconsolate time, when the busy temper shall be more than usually apt to vex and trouble him,
and the pains of a dying body to hinder and discompose
him, and the settlemtnt of worldly affairs to disturb and
confound him; and in a word, all things conspire to make
his sick-bed grievous and uneasy: nothing can then stand
up against all these ruins, and speak life in the midst of
death, but a clear conscience.
19. And the testimony of that shall make the comforts
of heaven descend upon his weary head, like a refreshing
dew, or shower upon a parched ground. It shall give him
some lively earnests, and secret anticipations of his approaching joy. It shlall bid his soul to go out of the body122   The Young Gentlenan and Lady's Monitoc,
undauntedly, and lif up his head with confidence before
saints and angels. Surlely the comfort, whichit conveys
at this season, is something bigger than the capacities of
mortality, mighty and unspeakable, and not to be understood till it comes to be felt.
20. And now who would not quit all the pleasures, and
trash, and triflles, which are apt to captivate the heart of
man, and pulrsule the great rigours of piety, and austerities of a good life, to purchase to himself such a conscience,
as at the hour of death, when all the friendship in the
world shall bid him adieu, and the whole creation turns its
back upon him, shall dismiss the soul and close his eyes
with that blessed sentence,' Well done thou good and
faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.'
On Contentnment.
SPECTATOR, No. 574.
1. I WVAS once engaged in discourse with a Rosicrucian about thle great secret. As this kind of men (I mean
those of them who are not professed cheats) are over-run
with enthusiasm and philosophy, it was very amusing to
hear this religious adept descanting on his pretended discovery. He talked of the secret as of a spirit which lived
within an emerald, and converted every thing that was
near it to the highest perfection it is capable of.
2. It gives a lustre, says he, to the sun, and water to
the diamond. It irradiates eveiy metal, and enriches
lead with all the properties of gold. It heightens smoke
into flame, flame into light, and light into glory. He
further added, that a single ray of it dissipates pain, and
care, and melancholy, from the person on whom it falls.
In short, says he, its presence naturally changes every
place into a kind of heaven.
3. After he had gone on for some time in this unintelligible cant, I found that he jumbled natural and moral
ideas together in the same discourse, and that his great
secret was nothing else but content.
4. This virtue does indeed produce, in some measure,
all those effects which tle alchymist usually ascribes to
what he calls the philosopher's stone; and if it does not
bring riches, it does i*  same thing, by banishing theend English Teacher's Assistant.   125
desire of them. If it cannot remove the disquiettdes
arising out of a man's mind, body or fortune, it makes him
easy under them. It has in(leed a kindly influence on
the soul of man, in respect of every thing to whom he
stands related. It extinguishes all murmur, irepining and
ingratitude towards that Being who has allotted him his
part to act in this world. It destroys all inordinlate ambition, and every tendency to corruption, with regard
to the community wherein he is placed. It gives sweetness to his conversation, and a perpetual serenity to all
his thoughts.
5. Among the many methods which might be made use
of for the acquirting of this virtue, I shall only mention the
two following: First of all, a man should always consider
lhow imuch more unhappy he might be than he really is.
6. First of all, a mall should always consider how mucl
mnore he has than he wants. I am wonderfully pleased
with the reply which Aristippus made to one who condoled him upon the loss of a farm: Why, said he, I have
three farms still, and you have but one; so that I ought
rather to be afflicted foi' you than you for me. On the
tontrary, foolish men are more apt to consider what they
have lost than what they possess; and to fix their eyes
upon those who are richer than themselves, rather than
on those who are under greater difficulties.
7. All the real pleasures and conveniences of life lie in
a narrow compass; but it is the humour of mankind, to
be always looking forward, and straining after one who
has got the start of them in wealth and honour. For this
reason, as there are none can be properly called rich,
who have not more than they want; there are few rich
men in any of the politer nations but among the middle
sort of people, who keep their wishes within their fortunes,
and have more -wealth than they know how to enjoy.
8. Persons in a higher rank live in a kind of splendid
poverty; and are perpetually wanting, because, instead
of acquiescing in the solid pleasures of life, they eindeavour to outvie one another in shadows and appearances.
Men of sense have at all times beheld with a great deal
of mirth this silly game that is playing over their heads,
and by contracting their desires enjoy all that secret satisfPction ywhich others are alwayv in quest of.~nd English Teacher's Assistantto  
I 3. The next method therefore that I would propose to
fill up our time, should be useful and innocent diversion.
I must confess I think it is below reasonable creatures to be
altogether conversant in such diversions as are merely innocent, and having nothing else to recommend themz but
that there is no hurt in tllem.
14. WVhether any kind of i-mi:ng has even thlus much
to say for itself, I shall not determine; but I think it is
very wonderful to see persons of the best selnse, passi,no
away a dozen hou:rs together in shulffling- and dividing a
pack of cards, with no other' conversation but vwlhai is
mnade up of a few game pihrases, and no other ideas'but
those of black or -red spots ranged together in difierent
figures. Would not a man laugh to hear any one of his
species complaining, that life is short.
15. The stage might be made a perpetual soulrce of the
most noble and useiul entertainments, were it under proper regulations.
But the mind never unbends itself so a'greeably as in the
contversation of a well-chosen fiiiend. There is indeed no
blessing of life'that is any way comparable to the enjoy-mernt of a discreet and virtuous friend. It eases and unloads the mind, clears and improves the understanding,
engenders thoughts and knowledge, animates virtue and
good resolution, sooths and allays the passions, and finds
employmrent for most of the vacant Ihours of life
16. Next to such an intimacywith a particular person,
one would endciearour after a more g'neral conversatiol
with such as are able to entertain and impriove those with
whom they converse, which are quialifications that seldom
go asunder.
There are many other useful amusements of life, whichI
one would endearour to multiply,'that one might on all
occasions have recourse to somnething rather than suffer
the mind to lie idle, or run adrift with any passion that
chances to rise in it.
7. A mra that has a taste in music, painting, or architecture, is like one that has another sense when comparedc
with such as havle no relish for those arts. The florist, the
planrter, the gardener, the husbandman, when they are on.ly a accomplishments'to the nan of fortune, alregreat re,
E124   ne Young Gentlema mand Lady's'Monitor,
9. The truth is, this ridiculous chase after imaginary
pleasures cannot be sufficiently exposed, as it is the great
source of those evils which generally undo a nation. Let a
man's estate be what it will, he is a poor man if he does
not live within it, and naturally sets himself to sale to any
one that can give him his price.
10. When Pitticus, after the death of his brother, who
had left him a good estate, was offered a greater sum of
money by the king of Lydia, he thanked him for his kindness, but told him he had already more by half than he
knew what to do xwith. In short, content is equivalent to
wealth, and luxury to poverty; or, to give the thought a
more agreeable turn,' Content is natural wealth,' says Socrates; to which I shall add,' Luxury is artificial poverty.'
II. I shall therefore recommend to the consideration of
those who are always aiming after superfluous and imaginary enjoyments, and will not be at the trouble of contracting their desires, an excellent saying of Bion the
philosopher; namely,' That no man has so much care
as he who endeavours after the most happiness.'
12. In the second place, every one ought to reflect how
much more unhappy he might be than he really is. The
former consideration took in all those who are sufficiently
provided with the means to make themselves easy; this
regards such as actually lie under some pressure or misfortune.
13. These may receive a great alleviation firom such a
comparison as the unhappy person may make between
himself and others, oi between the misfortunes which he
suffers, and greater misfortunes which might have befallen
him.
14. I like the story of the honest Dutchman, who upon
breaking his leg by a fall from the main-mast, told the
standers-by, it was a great mercy that it was not his neck.
To which, since I am got into quotations, give me leave to
add the saying of an old philosopher, who, after having
invited some of his friends to dine with him, was ruffled
by his wife that came into the room in a passion and
threw down the table that stood before them;' Every
one, says he, has his calamity, and he is a happy mai
that has no greater than this.'
15. We find an instance to the same purpose in the lifeand English Teacher's Assistant.   125
of Doctor Hammond, written by Bishop Fell. As this
good man was troubled with a complication of distempers,
when he had the gout upon him, he used to thank God that
it was not the stone; and when he had the stone, that he
had not both these distempers on him at the same time.
16. I cannot conclude this essay without observing, that
there was never any system besides that of christianity,
which could effectually produce in the mindof man the virtue I have been hitherto speaking of. In order to make us
content with our present condition, many of the present
philosophers tell us, that our discontent only hurts ourselves, without being able to make an alteration-in our
circumstances; others, that whatever evil befals us, is
derived to us by a fatal necessity, to which the gods
thlemselves are subject; while others very gravely tell
the man who is miserable, that it is necessary he should
be so to keep up the harmony of the universe, and that
the 8cheme of Providence would be troubled and perverted were he otherwise.
17. These, and the like considerations, rather silence
than satisfy a man. They may shew him that his discontent is unreasonable; but are by no means sufficient
to relieve it. They rather give despair than consolation.
In a word, a man might reply to one of these comforters,
as Augustus did to his friend who advised him not to
grieve for the death of a person whom he loved, because
his grief could not fetch him again:' It is for that very
reason, said the emperor, that I grieve.'
18. On the contrary,religion bears a more tender regard
to human nature. It prescribes to a very miserable man
the means of bettering his condition; nay, it shews him
that the bearing of his afflictions as he ought to do, will
naturally end in the removal of them: It makes hira easy
here, because it can make him happy hereafter.
19. Upon the whole, a contented mind is the greatest
blessing a man can enjoy in this world; and if in the present life his happiness arises from the subduing his desires,
it will arise in the next from the gratification of them.
Human M3tiseries chieJfl imaginary.
1. IT is a celebrated thought of Socrates, that if all the
misfortunes of mankind were cast into a public stock, inf26 Te7zhe toung Gleztilemanw and Lady's Moniltor,
order to be equally distributed among the whole species,
those who now tlhink themselves the most unhappy, would
prefer the shar tehey are already possessed of, before that
which wvould fall to them by such a division. Horace has
carried this thought a g-reat deal furthler; who says, that
the hardships or misfortunes we lie under, are more easy
to us than those of any other person would be, in case we
should change condcitions wvith him.
2. As I was ruminating- onl these t- o remanaks, and
seaced in my elbow cha ir I insensibly fie1 aslekp;  when,
on asuddenh methou~ht there was a proclamation made
by Ju7/iteir, tiat ev-ery mortal should bring in his giriefs
and calaInitie3, and thlrow them- togethe in a lzap. There
was a large plain appointed ior this p ui -ose. I took rmy
stanid in tLle centre of i, and sayv, witli a'geat deal of
pleaLsu-re? the whvole huImrian species rnaircling one aafter
anothi', and throw-ing down their several loads, whicl
inmmLediataeley grew up itto a prodigious lmountaiin that
see-med to rise.above the cloudIs.
3.'lhere was a ce'ertain lady, of a thin airy s eape, who
vas vFry active in this solemnlity. She carried a magnifying glass in one of her hands, and was cloathed in a loose
flowing, r"obe, embroidcleed  with several fig ures of fiends
and spectres, that discovered tk-emselves in a thousand
chimerical shapes, as her garments hovered in the wvind;
there was something;ild and distracted in her lookso
4. Iler name was /:ancy. She led up every m-ortal to
the appointed place, after havinig.,ery officiotusly assisted
hiim in making up his p-ack, and laying it upon his shoulders. My heart melted within me to see my fellow-creatures groaning under their respective burthens, and to
consider that p rodigious bulk of humnan calanmities which
lay before me.
5. There vere, however, several persons who gave me
great diversion upon this occasion. I observed one bringinig in a fardel very carefully concealed under an old embroidered cloak, which, upon his throwing it into the heap,
I discovered to be poverty. Another, after a great deal
of )uffing, threw down his luggage, which, upon examining, I found to be his wife.
6. There were multitudes of lovers saddled with verly
bwhimsical burthens, composed of di;rts and flames; buttznd English' Teach er's Asslstant.  I 7
twhat was very oldd, though they sighed as if their hearts
would break under these bundles of calainities, they couild
not peirsuade themselves to cast themn into tlhe heap, w-hen
they came up to it; but, after a few fainit efforts, shook
their heads and marched awvay, as heavy laden as thev
came.
7. I saw multitudes of old women tlhrow down their
wrinkles, and several young ones v lho stripped themselves
of a tawny skin. There were very great heaps of red
neses, large lips, and rusty teeth. The truth of it is, r
was surprised to see the greatest part of the mountain
made up of bodily deform.ittivs. Ob1serving one aldvancing
towards the heap w-ith a larger cargo than ordinalry unon
Ihis back, I found, upon his necar approaclh, that it was only a natural hump, w,-hich he disposed of with great joy ojf
heart, among this collection of human  miseries.
8. There were likew-ise distermpers of all sorts, tlhoulgli
I could not but olbserve, thlat there were many more imaginary than real. One little packet I could net but take
notice of, which was a complication of the diseases incident to human nature, and was in the ianls of a great
many fine people: t'his was called the spleen. But what
most of all surprised me, i-was a remlark I made, that there
was not a single vice or folly thrown into the whole heap;
at which I wvas very much astonished, having concluded
within myself, that every one would take this opplortuni:y
of getting rid of his passions, prejudices and frailties.
9. I took notice in particular of a very profligate fellow,
who, I did not question, came laden wvith his crimes, but,
upon searching into his bundle, I found, that instead of
throwing his guilt friom him, lie lhad only laid down his
memory. He was followed by another w-orthless rogue,
who flung away his modesty instead of his ignoiance.
10. WVhlen the whole race of mankind had thus cast
their burthens, the /lzci:to(m, which had been so busy onr
this occasion, seeing me an idle spectator of what passed,
approached towards me. I grew uneasy at hei presence,
when, on a sudden, she laid her magnifying glass full before my eves. I no sooner saw my faice in it but was
startled at the shortness of it, which noiw appeared to me
in its utmost aggravation.! 1. The immoderate breadth of my features made nme128   The Youzg czGentlemlan alzd Lady's Monitor,
very much out of humour with my ow n coulltenance, upon which I threw it from me like a masl;. it happened
very luckily, that one who stood by me ihac just before
thrown down his visage, which, it seems, was too long for
him. It was, indeed, extended to a niost shameful length;
I believe the very chin was, modestly speaking, as long
as my whole face.
12. WVe had both of us an opportunity of mending
ourselves, and all the contributions being now brought in,
every man was at liberty to exchange his misfortune for
those of another persoii. But as there arose many lew
incidents iin the sequel of my vision, I shall pursue this
subject further, as the moral which may be drawn fiom
it, is applicable to persons of all degrees and stations in
life.
13. I GAVE my reader a sight of that mountain of miseries, which was made up of those several calamities that
afflict the minds of men. I saw with unspeakable pleasure,
the whole species thus deliveredfrom its sorrows; though,
at the same time, as we stood round the heapl), and surveyed
the several materials of which it was composed, there w-as
scarce a mortal, in this vast multitude, w-ho did not discover vlwhat he thought pleasures and blessings of life; and
wondered how the owners of them ever caime to look upon them as burthens and grievances.
14. As we were regardingTvery attentively this calfusion
of miseries, tliis chaos of calamiity, Jufitter issued out a
second proclamation, that eivery one %was now at liberty to
exchange his affliction, and to return to his habitation with
any such other bundle as should be delivered to him.
15. Upon this, Fanzcy began again to bestir lierself, and
parcelling out the whole heap, with incredible activity, recommended to eivery one his particular packet. Tlhe hillrlry
and confusion at this time was not to be expressed. Soniie
observations which I made upcli the occasion, I sihall
communicate to the reader. A venerable grey-lheaded
man, who had laid down his cholic, and wvho, I found,
wanted,a heil to his estate, snatched up an undutiful son,
that had been thrown into the heap by his angry father.

father, who came towards him in a fit of the gripes, he
begged Ihim to take his son again, and give him back his

chlains, took up the gout in their stead, but minade such -w-ry

several exchanges that were made, for sickness against
poverty, hunger against want of appetite, and care against
pain.
18. The female world were very busy among themselves
in bartering for features; one was truckiilg a lock of grey
hairs for a carbuncle, another i-as making over a short
waist for a pair of ro-and shoulders, and a third cheapening a bad face for a lost reputation: but on all these occasions, there was inot one of them who did not think the
new blemish, as soon as she had got it into her possession,
much more disagreeable than the old one.
19. I made the same observation on every other mnisfortune or calamity, whichl every one in the assembly brought
upon himself, in lieu of what he had parted with; whether it be that all the evils which befal us, are in some
measure suited and proportioned to our strength, or that
every evil becomes more supportable by our being accustomed to it, I shall not determine.
29. I could not, for mny heart, forbear pitying the poor

his bladder; nor the fine gentleman who had struck up
this bargain with lhim, that limped thrlough a whole assembly of ladies -who used to admire him, with a pair of
sh oulders peeping over his head.

23. One of these looked like a man walking upon stilts,
and was so lifted up in the air above his ordinary height,
that his headl turned round with it, while the other made
such aukward circles, as he attempted to walk, that he
scarce knew how to rnmove forward upon his new supporters: observin hIiim to be a pleasant kind of fellow, I stuck

TATLER, NO. 97.
1. WV[IEN Hercules, savs the divine Prodicus, was in
that part of his youth, in vwhich it was natural for him to
consider what course of life he ought to pursue, lhe one
day retired into a desert, where the silence and solitude of
tlhe place very much favoured his meditations.
2. As he was musing on his present condition, an(d vers
much perplexed in himself on the state of life he should
chuse, lie saw twvo women of a larger stature than ordinary
approaching towards him. One of them had a very noble
air and graceful deportment; her beauty was lnatural and
easy; her person clean and unspotted; her eyes cast towards the ground, with an agreeable reserve; her motion
and behaviour full of modesty; and her raiment as wvhit(:
as snow.
3. The other had a great deal of health and fiorridness
in her countenance, whicl she hlad helped with anl art ificia'
white and red, and endeavoured to appear more graceiui
than ordinary in her mein, by a mixture of affectation in
all her gestures. She had a wonderful contidence and assurance in her looks, and all the variety of coiours in her
driess that she thougIht were the most proper to shew her
complexion to an advantage. She cast her eyes upon herself, then turned them on those that were present to see
how they liked lier, and often looked on the figure she
made in lier own shadow.
4. Upon her nearer approachi to HIercules, she stepped
before the othier lady, who came forward with a regular
composed carriage, and running up to him, accosted him
after the following manner:
5. My dear Hercules, says she, I find you are very much
divided in your own thoughts upon the way of life that vou.
Ei 212?2  YTie lYunzzg Celtl?nan and Lady's MIonitoi,
ought to chluse: be my friend and follow me; I will lead you
into the possession of pleasure and out of the reach of pain,
and remove you firom all the noise and disquietude of business.'l'he aflairs of either war or peace shall have no power
to disturb you. Your whole employment shall be to make
your life easy, and to entertain evelry sense with its proper
gratifications. Sumptious tables, beds of roses, cloudsof
perfumes, concerts of music, crouds of beauties, arle all in
readiness to receive you. Come along with me into this
region of delights, this world of pleasure, and bid farewell
for ever to care, to pain, and to business.
6. Hercules keairing the lady talk after this manner, desired to know her name; to which she answered, my
firiends, and those who are well acquainted with me, call me
1Iappiness; but my enemies, and those who would injure
ny reputation, have given me the name of Pleasure.
7. By this time the other lady was come up, who addressed hlerself to the young hero in a very different manner.
Hercules, says he, I offer myself to you, because I know
yvou are descended from the gods, and give proofs of that
&lt;lescent by your love to virtue, and application to the
studies proper to your age. This makes me hope you will
gain both for yourself and me an immort;l reputation.
But lbfore I invite you into my society and friendship, I
will be open and sincere with you, and must lay down this
as an established truth, that there is nothing truly valuable which can be purchased without pains and labour.
8. The gods have set a price upon every real and noble
-pleasure. If you would gain the favour of the Deity, you
must be at the pains of worshipping him; if the friendship
of good men, you must study to oblige them; if you would
be honoured by your country, you must take care to serve
it. In short, if you would be eminent in war or peace,
you must become master of all the qualifications that can
mnake you so. These are the only terms and conditions
upon which I can propose happiness. The goddess of
pleasure here broke in upon her discourse:
9. You see, said she, Hercules, by her own confession,
tie way to her pleasure is long and difficult, whereas that
which I prepose is short and easy. Alas! said the other
lady, whose visage glowed with a passion made up of scorn
and pity, what are the pleasures you propose? To eat bean.d En'liyh Teacher's Assistant.   133
fore you are hungry, drink before you are thirsty, sleep
before you are tired, to gratify appetites before they are
raised, and raise sulch appetites as nature never planted.
10. You never heard thle most delicate music, whvich is
tlhe praise of one's self; nor saw the most beautifil olject,
which is the work of one's own hands. Yotur otaries pass
away their youth in a dream of mistaken pleasures, while
they are hoarding up anguish, torment, and remorse, for
old age.
11. As for me, I am a friend of the Gods and of good
men, an agreeable companion to the artisan, a household
guar(lian to the fathers of families, a patron and protector
of servants, and associate in all true and generous fiiendships. The banquets of my votaries are never costly, but
always delicious; for none eat or drink at them who are
not invited by hunger and thirst. Their slumbers are
sound, and their wakings cheerful.
12..My young men have the pleasure of heariing themselves praised by those wilo are in years, and those vlwho are
in years, of being honoured by those wh]lo are young. In
a word, my followers are favoured by the gods, beloved by
their acquaintance, esteemed by their country, and after
the close of their labours, honoured by posterity.
13. We know by the life of this memorable hero, to
which of these two ladies he gave up his heart; and I believe, every one who reads this, will do him the iustice to
approve his choice.
i14. I very much admire the speeches of these ladies, as
containing in them the chiefarguments for a life of virtue,
or a life of pleasure, that could enter into the thoughts of
an heathen: but am    particularly pleased with the different figures he gives the two goddesses. Our modern authors lhave represented pleasure or vice with an alluring
face, but ending in snakes and monsters: here she appears in all thie charms of beauty, though they are all false
and borrowe(l; and by tlat means Lomnpose a vision entirely natural and pleasing.
15. I have translated this allegory for the benefit of the
youth in general; and particularly of those who are still
in the deplorable state of non-existence, and whom I most
earnestly intreatto come into the world. Let ny embryos
shew the least inclination to any single virtue, and I shall
allow it to be a struggling towards birth.S     TLTe Young Gentletman and Lady's Mon-ltor,

I could not but observe, that notwithstanding.5 we are oblig'ed by duty to keep ourselves:  i constant eimploy, after the
same manner as inferior animals are prompted to it by instianct, we fall very short of them in this particular.
19. i~We are the more inexcusable, because there is a
preater variety of business to which we may apply ourselves. Reascn opens to us a large field of affairs, whlich
ether creatures are not capable of. Beasts of prey, and I
believe all other kinds, in their natural-state of being, divide their tilne between action and rest. They are always

1. I HAVE more than once had occasion to mention
a noble saying of Seneca the philosopher, that a virtuous
person strugglingw ith misfortunes, and rising al)ove them,
is an object on which the gods theniselves may look downI
wvith delight. I shall therefore set before my readers a
scene of this kind of distress in private life, for the speculation of this day.
2. An eminent citizen, who had lived in good fashion
and credit, was by a train of accidents, and by an unavoidable perplexity in his affairs, reduced to a low condition.
There is a modesty usually attendinig faultless poverty,
which made him rather chuse to reduce his manner of
living to his present circumstances, than solicit his firiends,
in order to support the shew of an estate, when the substance was gone.
3. His wife, who was a woman of sense and virtue, behaved herself on this occasion with uncommon decency,
and never appeared so amiable in his eyes as now. Instead
of upbraiding him with the ample fortune she had brought,
or the many great offers she had refused for his sake, she
redoubled all the instances of her affection, while her
husband was continually pouring out his healt to her in
complaints, that he had ruined the bestwoman inthe world.
4. He sometimes came home at a time when she did not
expect him, and surprised her in tears, which she endeavoured to conceal, and always put on an air of cheerfulness
to receive him. To lessen their expense, their eldest
daughter (whom I shall call Amanda) was sent into the country, to the house of an honest farmer, who had married aand Engiish Teacher's Assistant.     1 S
servant of the family: This young woman was apprechensive of the ruin which was approaching, and had privately
engaged a friend in the neighbourhood to igive her an accvunt of vwhat passed firom time to timiez in her fithelcr's affairs.
5. Amanlda was in the bloom of her youth and beauty,
when the lord of the manor, who often called in at the farmer's house as he followed his country sports, fell passionately in love with her. He was a man of great generosity, but from a loose education had contracted a hearty
aversion to marriage. I-He therefore entertained a design
upon Amanda's virtue, -which at present he thought fit
to keep private. Tihe innocent creature, wvho never suspected his intentions, vas pleased wit'h his personi; and,
having observed his growing passion for her, hoped by
so advantageous a match she might quicklv be in a capacity of supporting helr impoverislhed relations.
6. One day as he called to see her, lie found her in tears
over a letter she had just received from her friend, which
gave an account that her father had been lately stript of
every thing by an execution. The lover, who with some
difficultv found out the cause of her grief, took this occasion to make her a proposal. It is impossible to express
Amanda's confusion when she found his pretentions were
not honourable.
7. She was now deserted of all hopes, and had no power
to speak; but rushing from him in the utmost (listurbance,
locked herself up in her chlamber. IHe immediately dispatched a messengerto her father with the following letter.
8.    SIR,
I HAVE heard of your misfortunle, and have offered
your dauglhter, if she vwill live with wvith me, to settle o~
her foun' Lundred pounds a ye.ar, and to lay down the sum
for which yotl are now distressed. I will be so ingenuous
as to tellyou, that I do not intend marriage; but if you are
wise, you will use your authority with her not to be too
nice, wvlen she has an opportunity of serving you and your
family, and of making herself happy.'I ami, &amp;c.'
9. This letter came to the hands of Amanda's mother:
she opened and read it with great surprise and concern.
She did not think it proper tQ explain herself to the mes1 6   Thle Young Gentleman and Lady's Monitor,
scnger; but desiring him to call again the next morning,
sile w ote to her daughter as follows:
10. Deartst Ch-id,
YOUR father and I have juist now received a ietter
friom a gentleman who pretends love to o-ou, with a propo.
sal that insults our misitrtunes, and woulld thriow us to a
lower degree of misery than any thing which is come upoa
us. How could this barbarous man think that the ten.
derest of parents would be tempted to supply their wants,
by giving up the best of children to intfamy and ruin!
It is a mean and cruel artifice to make this proposal at a
time when lie thinks our necessities must compel us to any
thing; but we will not eat the bread of shane; and ther'fore we charge thee not to think of us, b,ut to avoid the
snare which is laid for tby virtue. Beware of pitying us:
it is not so bad as you have perhaps been told. All things
will yet be well, rfnd I shall W,rite rmy child better news.
I have been inte:rrupted. I know not how I was mloved
to say things would mend. As I was going on, I iwas startled by the Inoise of one that knocked at the door, ancl had
brought us an une xpected supply of a debt which had long
been owing. Oh I I will now tell thee all. It is some
days I have lived almost without support, having conveyed
what little money I could raise to your poor fatlther. Thou
wilt weep to think vwhere he is, y-et be assured he will soon
be at liberty. That cruel letter would have l)roke his heart,
but I have concealed it from hiin. I have no companion
at present besides little Fanny, who stands watching my
looks as I write, and is cr)-ying for her sister; she says she
is sure you are not well, having discovered that my present
trouble is about you. But do not think I would tlhus repeat my sorrows to grieve thee. No, it is to intreat thee
not to make tliem insupportable, by adding whiat would
be worsethan all. I,et us bear cheerfully an affliction whlich
-we have not brouglht on ourselves, and rememnber there is
a Power who can better deliver us out of it, than by the loss
of thy innocence. Heaven preserve my dcear chlild.

imspatient to know\ the success of his proposal, and therefore brioke open the lett;er ):-iatcly, to see the contents.
12. He was not a little moved at so true a picture of virtue in distress: but, at the same time, was infinitely surprised to find his offirs rejected. However, he resolved
not to suppress the letter, but carefully sealed it up again,
and carried it to Anianda. All his endeavours to see her
were ill vain, till she was assured he brought a letter from
her mother. Hie would not pairt with it but upon condtition that she should read it without leaving the room.
13. While she -was perusing, it, he fixed his eyes on her
face with the deepest attention; her concern gave a newiv
softness to lier beauty, and when she burst into ttars, he
could no longer reftrain fromn bearing a part in her sorrow,
apld telling her, that he too had read the letter, and wvas
resolved to make reparation for having been the occasion
of it. My reader will not be displeased to see the second
epistle wvhicli he now wvrote to Amlanda's mother.
MN A D A M,
I AM~ full of shame,and wvill never forigie myself if I
have not your pardon for what I lately wrote. It w-as

could any thing but my being a strianger to you, have betraved mne into a fault, for which, if I live, I shall endeaVour to make you amends as a son. You cannot be unhappy while Amanda is yotur daughter: nor shall be, if

14. This letter he sent by his steward, and soon after
went up to town hlimself to complete the generous act he
had now resolved on. By his friendship and assistance,
Amanda's father was quickly in a condition of retrieving
his perplexed affairs. To conclude, he married Amanda,
and enjoyed the double satisfaction of having restored a
uworthy family to their former prosperity, and of making
himself happy by an alliance to their virtues.is8  D7Ye Young 6entlemans and Lady's Monitori,
The Story of Abdallah and Balstra.
GUARDIAN, No. 161.
1. TIHE following story is lately translated out of an
Arabian manuscript, which I think has very much the
turn of an oriental tale: and as it has never before been
printed, I question not but it will be highly acceptable to
my reader.
2. The name of Ilelim is still famous through all the
eastern parts of the world. He is called among the Persians, even to this day, Helim the great physician. He
wvas acquainte(l with all the powers of simples, understood
all the influence of the stars, and knew the secrets that
irre engraved on the seal of Solomon the son of David.
IIelim was also governor of the black palace, and chief of
the physicians to Alnareschin the great king of Persia.
3. Alnareschin wvas the most dreadful tyrant that ever
reigned inthis country. He was of a fearful, suspicious
and cruel nature, having put to death, upon very slight
jealousies and surmises, five-and-thirty of his queens, and
above twenty sons whom he suspectedl to have conspired
against his life. Being at length wearied with the exercise of so many cruelties in his own family, and fearing
lest the whole race of Caliphs should be entirely lost, he
one day sent for Ilelim, and spoke to him after this mannel.
4,' Helim,' said he,' I have long admired thy great
wisdom, and retired way of living. I shall now shew thee
the entire confidence which I place in thee. I hav-e only
two sons remaining, who are as yet but infants. It is my
design that thou take them home with thee, and educate
them as thy own. Train them up in the humble unambitious pursuits of knowledge. By this means shall the
line of Caliphs be preserved, and my children succeed after me, without aspiring to my throne whilst I am yet
alive.'
5. The %words of my lord the king shall be obeyed, said
Helim. After which he bowed, and went out of the king's
presence. He then received the children into his own
house, and frcm that time bred them up with him in the
studies of knowle&amp;dge and virtue. The young princes
loved and respecteCd Helim as their father, and made suchend lEnglish- racher's Assistant.  1 39
improvements under him, that by the age of one-andtwenty they were instructed in all the learning of the East.
6. The name of the eldest was Ibrahim, and of the
youngest AbdaUlah. They lived together in such a perfect
f~riendship, that to this day it is said of intimate friends,
that they live together like Ibrahim and Abdallah. Helim had an only child, who was a girl of a fine soul, and
a most beautiful person. Her father omitted nothini in
her education, that might make her the most accomplished woman of her age.
7. As the young princes were in a manner excluded
firom the rest of the world, they frequently conversed with
this lovely virgin, who had been brought up by her father
in the same course of knowledge and of virtue.
8. Abdallah, wvhose mind w-as of asofter turn than that
of his brother, grew by degrees so enalmoured of her conversation, that he did lnot thlink lie lived, -when he was niot
in company with his belovecl Balsora, for that was the name
-of the maid. The fame of her beauty was so great, that
at length it came to the ears of the king, wrho, pretending.
to visit the young princes his sons, demanded of Hlelin
the sight of Balsora his failr daughter.
9. The king was so enflamed with her beauty and behaviour, that he sent for Helim the next morning, and
told him it w-as now his design to recompence him fobr all
his faithful selrvices; and that in order to it, he intended
to make his daughter queen of Persia.
10. Helim, who knew very well the fate of all those
unhappy women who had been thus advanced, and could
not bult be privy to the secret love which Abdallah lx&gt;re
his daughter;' Far be it,' says he,' firom the king of Persia to cmntaminate the blood of the Caliphs, and joinl himself in marriage with the daughter of his physcian.'.11. The king, howeveer,  as so i-mpatient for such a
bride, that without hearing any excuses, he immediately
ordered Balsora to be sent for into his presence, keeping
the fatlher with him in o rder to make her sensible of the
honour which he designed. Balsora, who was too modest
and humble to think her beauty had made such an impres-sion on the king, was a few moments after brought into
his presence as he had commanded.
12. She appeared in the king's eye as one of the virgins
-  ---'-C~'~' ~ "'r, ~+u~ur  v I~ 1NLI140   Tice Youlg Genlemnan and Lady's'Monitor,
of paradise. Butt upon hearing the honour which he intended her, she fainted awayv and fell down as dead Lat his
feet. Helimii wept, and after having recovered her out of
the ttrance into which she was fallen, represented to the
king that so unexpected an honour was too great to lhave
been communicated to her all at once; but that, if he
pleased, he would himself prepare her for it. The king
bid him take his own away and dismissed him.
13. Balsora was conveyed again to her father's house,
where the thoughts of Abdallah renewed her affliction
every moment; insomuch that at length she fell into a
raging fever. Tl'he king was informed of her condlitionl
by those who saw her. Hlelim finding no othler nmeans of
extricating her from the difficulties she was in, after having
comnosed her mind, and mnade her acquainted with his intentions, gave her a certain potion, which he knew would
lay her asleep for many hours; and afterwards in all the
seeming distress of a disconsolate father informed the
king she was dead.
14. The king, who never let any sentiments of humanity
come too near his heart, did not much trouble himself about
the matter; however, for Ihis own reputation, lhe told the
father, that since it was known through the empire that
Balsora died at a time when he designed her for his bricle,
it was his intention that she should be honoured as such
after her death, that her body should be laid in the black
palace, among those of his deceased queens.
15. In the mean time Abdallah, who had heard of the
king's design, was not less afflicted than his beloved Balsora. As for the several circumstances of his distress, as
also how the king was informed of an irrecoverable distemper into which he was fallen, they are to be founci at
length in the history of Helim.
16. It shall suffice to acquaint the reader, that Helii,
some days after the supposed death of his daughter, ga7ve
the prince a potion of the same nature with which he had
laid asleep Balsora.
17. It is the custom among the Persians, to convey in
a private manner the bodies of all the royal family a little
after their death, into the black palace; which is the repository of all who are descended from the Caliphs, or any
way allied to them. The chief physician is always goverand Eng wish Teache r's Assistant.    1: t

which are each of them watched day.and night by an ihundred negroes, who are to take care-that lobody enters
besides the governor.
19, Helim, after having conveyed the body of his claug'ter into this repository, and at the appointed time received
her out of the sleep into which slhe was fallen, tooki care
sdtne time after to bring that of Abdallab iinto thie same
placo. Balsora watched over him till-such time as the dose
he had taken lost its effect. Abdallah was not acquainted
witlh Helim's design when he gave him this sleepy potion.
20. It is imppssible to describe the surprise, the joy, the
transport he was in at ihis first awaking. He fanciedl himself in the retirement of the blest, and that -the spirit of
his dear Balsora, who he thought was just gone before
him, was the first wiho came to congratulate his arrival.
~She soon informed him of the place he was in, which notwithstanding all its horrors, appeared to him more sweet
than'thle bower of Mahomet, in the company of his Balsora.
2 1o Helirm, whoilvas supposed to be taken up in the emabalming of the bodies, visited the place very frequently.
IHEis greatest perplexity was how to get the -lovers out of
it5 the gates being Aatched in such a manner; as I have before related.  This consideration did not a little disturb
thne two interred lovers.
22, At length Helim bethought himself, that the first
day of the full mnoon of the month Tizpa was near at hand..Now it is a received tradition among- the Persiansi,that tlsouls of those of the royal family, who are in a state of bliss,
dlo,on tlh4first full moon after their decease, pass throug.hl
the eastern gate of the black palace, which is theref,Orl'e
called the Gate of Paradise, in order to take their flight
for that happy place.
203. Helim, therefore, having made due preparation for
this night, dressed each, of the lovers in a - robe of azure
cilk, wroug'ht in the finest looms of Persia, witlh a long't4   h7'le Yozutg, Gntlemin a,ld  dy's'tonitortrail of linen whiter than snow, that flowed on the ground
behind them. Upon Abdallah's head he fixed a wreath
of the greenest myrtle, and on Balsora's a garland of the'reshest roses. Their garmlenits were scented with the
richest pe rfumes of Arabia.
24. Having thus prepared every thing, the full moon
was no sooner up, and shining in all its brightness, but he
priv-ately cpened the Gate of Paradise, and shut it after
the same manner, as soon as they ihad passed through it.. The band of negiroes who'were posted at a little dis,
tance fron the gate, seeing two such beautiful apparitions,
that shewed tth'emelIves to'advantage by the lighlt of the:ulIl moon, and beingS ravished with the odour that flowed
from their garlnents, immiediately concluded tlhem to be
the ghosts of the two person.s lately deceased.
26. They fell upon, their faces as they passed througqh the
midst of them, and continued prostrate on the earth ulntil,such time as they were out of sight.; They reported the
next day what they had seen, but this was looked upon by
the king himself and most others, as the compliment that
was usually paid to any of the deceased of his family.
27. F-elim had placed two of his, own mules about a
mile's distance from the black temple, on the spot which
they had agreed upon for their rendezvous. Here he met
them, and conducted them to one of his own houses, which
was situated on m-ount Klacan.
28 The air of thi;s mountain was so- very healthfulr, that
Helim had formnerlly transported the king thither, in order
to recover him out of a long fit of sickness, whiich succeeded so well, that the king made-him a present of the
whole mountain, with a beautiful house and gardentha.t
were on the top of it.
29. In this retirement lived Abdallah and Balsorao
They were both so fraught with all kinds of knowledge,
and possessed with so constant and mutual a passion for
each other, that their solitude never lay heavy oathenm.
30. Abdallalh applied himself to-those arts which were
agreeable to his manner of living-, and the situation of the
place; insomuch that in a few years he converted the whole
mountain into a kind of garden, and covered every part
of it with plantations or spots of flowers.
Helim was too good a father to let him wvant any thing
that migllt conduce to make his retirelment pleasant.u(ll(l English Teac,;'zer's Assistant.  14.3
31. In abot ten years after their abode in this place, tile
old king died, and was succeeded by his son Ibrahimi, Wliho
upon the supposed death of his brotherl, had been called tp
court, and entertained there as heir to the Persian empire.
Though he was some years inconsolable for the death of
his brother, Helim durst not trust him with the secret,
which he knewv vwvould have fatal consequences, should it
by any means come to the knowledge of the old king-.
302. Ibrahimn was no sooner mounted to tihe throne, ut
Helim sought after a proper opportunity of making a discovery to himll, which he knew would be very agreeable to
so goocl lnatured and generous a prince. It so happened,
that before Helimli fiound sulch an opportunity as he desired,
the new king Ibrahim, having been separatedc firor  his
company in a chace, and almost fainting with heat an'd
thirst, saw himself at the foot 6f mount Khacan. He imlmediately ascended the hill, and coining to Helim's house,
demanded some refreshments.
3o. Helim was very luckily there at that time; and after
hlaving set before the king the choicest of wines and fruits,
finr.din him wonlderfully pleased with so seasonable a treat,
told him that the best part of his entertainment was to
come. Upon which he opened to him.the whole history
of what had passed. The king was at once astonished ind
transported at so strange a relation, and seeing his brother
enter the room with Balsora in his hand, he leaped off firol
the sofa on wlhich he sat, and cried olt,' It is he! it is
my Abdallah!' Having said this, he fell upon his neck,
and wept.
34. The whole company for some time remained silent,
and shedding tears of joy. The king at length having
kindly reproached Helim for depriving him so long fronm
such a brother, embraced Balsora with the greatest tenderness, and told her that she should now be a queen indeed,
for that he woutld immediately make-his brother king of all
the conquered nations on the otller side the Tigris.
35. He easily discovered in the-eyes of our two lovers,
that instead of-being transported with the offer, they preferred their present retirement to empire. At their request, therefore, he changed his intentions, and made tllem
a present of all the open country as far as they cotild see
fr; om the top of mounilt Khacan.

there being several of the sex lately arrived, who had not

24. I was sur1)rised to he;ar him ask every one of therr
the same question, namely, What they had been doing?
Upon this question being proposed to tile whole assembly
they stared upon one anotlhe, as not knowing what to answer. He then interrogated each of them separately.
Madam, says he to thle first of them, you have been upon the earth about fifty years: Vllat have you been doing there all this while? Doing, says she, really I do not
know what I have been doing: I desire I may have time
given me to recollect.
25. After about half an hour's pause, she told him that
she liaa been playing at crimp: upon which Rhadamanthuts
beckoned to the keeper on his left hand, to take her into
custody. And you, Madam, says the judge, that look
with such a soft and languishing air; I think you set out
for this place in your nine and twentieth year; what have
you been dsing all this while? I had a great deal of business on my hands, says she, being taken up the first twelve
years of my life, in dressing a jointed baby, and all the
remaining part of it in reading plays and romances.
26. Very well, says he, you have employed your tilne to
good purpose. Away with her. The next was a plain
country woman: XVell, mistress, says Rhadzamanthus, and
what have you been doing.? An't please your worship,
says she, I did nlot live quite forty years; and in that time
brought my husband seven daughters, made him nine
thousand cheeses, and left my eldest girl with him to
look after his hoase in my absence, and who, I may venture to say, -is as pretty a housewife as any in the country.
27. R.fdairanthus smiled at the simplicity of the good
woman, and ordered the keeper of Elysium to take her into
his care. And you, fair lady, says he, what have you been
doing these five and thirty years? I have been doing,no

1. THERE are some vices and errdrs which, thou-gh1
often fatal to those in w-hom they are found, have yet, by
thie universal consent of mankind, been considere i  as enutitled to some deg,ee of respect, or have at least &gt;been exempted from contemlptuous infamy, and condemned by
the severest moralists with pity rather than detestation.
2. A constant and invariable example of this general
partiality will be foundcl in the different regard which has
aI*avs bleen shewn to rashness and cowardice; two vices,
of which, though they may be conceived eclually distant
from the middle point, w-here true fortitude is placed, and
may equally injure any public or private interest, yet the
one is never mentioned without some kind of veneration,
and the other always considered as a topic of unlimitetl ancd
licentious censure, on which all the virulence of reproach
may be lawrfully exerted.
3. The same distinction is made, by the common suffrage, between profusion and avarice, and perhaps between many other opposite vices; and, as I have foundt
reason to pay great regard to the voice of the people, in
cases whlere knowledge has been forced upon them by
experience, wvithout long deductions or deep researches,
I amn inclined to believe that this distribution of respect
is not iwithout some agreement with the nature of things;

of presumption and despondency; of steady confidence,
which promises a victory without contest, and heartless
pusilanimity, which shrinks back from the thought o0
great undertakings, confounds difficulty with impossibility, and considers all advancement towareds any new attainment, as irreversibly prohibited.
9. Presumption will be easily corrected. Every experimnent will teach caution, and miscarriages will hourly shev,
that attempts are not always rxewarded with success. The
most precipitate ardour will, in time, be taught the necessity of methodical gradation, and preparatory measures; and the most daring confidence be convinced thiat.

10. It is the advantage of vehemence and activity, that
thley are always hastening to their own reformation; because they incite us to try whether our expectations are
well grounded; and therefore detect the deceits which
they are apt to occasion. But timidity is a disease of the
mrind more obstinate and fatal; for a man once persuaded,
that any impediment is insuperable, has given it, witl
respect to himself, that strength and weight which it had
not before.
11. He can scarcely strive wvith vigour and perseverance, when he has no hope of gaining the victory; and
since he will never try his strength, can never discover
the unreasonableness of his fears.
12. There is often to be fouind in men devotec to literature, a kind of inltellectual cowardice, which whoever conaverses nmuch among them, may obs6rve frequently to deprdss the alacrity of enterprise, and by consequence to
retard the improvement of science.
13.'rhey haveannexed to every species -of knoxwledge,
some chimerical character of terror and inhibition, which
they transmit, without much reflection, from one to another; they first fright themselves, and then propagate
the panic to their scholars and acquaintances.
14. One study is inconsistent with a lively imagina'ion,
another with a solid judgment i one is improper in the
early parts of liie, another requires so much time, that it;
is not to be attempted at an advanced age; one is dry and
contracts the sentiments, another is diffuse and over-burdens:the memory; one is insufferable to taste and delicacy, andl another wears out life in the. study of words, and
is useless to a wise man, who desires only the knowledge
of things.
15. But of all the bugbears by which the infi ntes bharbati,
boys both young and old, have been hi-therto friightd
fiom diggressing into new tracts of learning, none has
been more mlischievously efficacious than an opinion that
every ki'nd of knowledge requires a peculiar genius, or
mental constitution, framied for the reception of some ideas
and the exclusion of others; and that to himl whose genius
is not adapted to the study wvhich he prosecutes, all labour
shall be vain and f-ru itless; vain as an endeavour to mingle
oil and water, or, in the language of chemistry, to alnalgamate  boAies of heterogeneous principles,e2lnd English teacher's Assistant.  147
T6.''his opinion we may reasonably suspectto have been
propogated, by vanity, beyond the truth. It is natural for
those who have raised a reputation by any science, to exalt themselves as endowed by heaven with peculiar powers,
or marked out by an extraordinary designation for their
profession: and to fright competitors away by representing the difficulties with which they niust contend, and the
necessity of qualities which are supposed to be not generally conferred, and which no man can know, but by experience, whether he enjoys.
17. To this discouragement it may possibly be answered,
that since a genius, whatever it may be, is like fire in the
flint, only to be produced by collision with a prloperl subject, it is thle business of every man to try whether his facuilties may not hal)pily co-operate with his desires; and
since they whose proficiency he admires, knew their own
force only by the event, he needs but engage in the samel
undertaking, with equal spirit, and nlay reasonably hope
for equal success.
18. There is another species of false intelligence, given
by those who pLrofess to shew the way to the summit of
knowledge, of equal tendency to depress the mind with
false distrust of itself, and weaken it by needless solicitude
and dejection. WVhen a scholar whom they desire to animate, consults them at his entrance on some new study, it
is common to make flattering representations of its p)leasantness and facilitv.
19.'Thus they generally attain one of the tuwo ends almost equally desirable; they either incite his industry by
elevating his hopes,or produce a hi&amp;i opinion of their own
abilities, since they are supposed to relate only what they
have found, and to have proceeded with no less ease than
they have promised to their followers.
20. The student, enflamed by this encouragement, sets
for&amp;ward in the new path, and proceeds a few steps with
great alacrity; but he soon finds asperities and intricacies
of lwhich he has not been forewarned, and imagining that
1ione ever were so entangled or fatigued before him, sinks
sutddenly into despair, and desists as from an expedition
in which fate opposes himn. Thus his terrors are mnultiplied by his hopes, and he is def[ated without resistance.

21. Of these treacherous instructors, the one clest:'ov-,s
industry, by declaring that industry is vain, the other oby
representing it as needless: the one cuts away the root of
hope, the other raises it only to be blasted. The one confines his pupil to the shore, bly telling him that his wreck
is certain; the otliher selids him to sea without preparing
him for tempests.        
22. False hopes and false terrors, are equallv to be
avoided. Every man who piroposes to grow eminent by
learning, should carry in his mind, at once, the difficultv of
excellence, and the force of industry; and remaember that
fame is not conferred but as the recoln)mpenice of labourl,
and that labour, vigorously continued, has not often failtc
of its reward.

1. LOOKING over the late edition of Mlonsieur Boileau's works, I was very much pleased with the article
which he has added to 1lis notes on the translation of Longinus. He ther e tells us, that the sublime in -writing rises
either from the nobleness of the thought, the magnificence
of the words, or the harmonious and iively turn of the
phrase, and that the perfect sublime rises fi-om all these
three in conjunction together. He produces an instanlce
of this perfect sublime in four verses from the Athalia of
Monsieur Racine.

which he used to pay his devotions to the goddess who
represented Providence anmong the heathens. I thilnk no
man was ever mnore distinguished by the Deity, whom hl

of, in several occurrellces of his life, but particularly iIi
the following one, wl-ich I shall relate otut of Pziutrcc/h.
11.'lThree pei-sons had1 enterled into a conspirlacy to assassinate Tinrimlc/u  as he w-as offering upl his devotions ill a
certain teminple. In order to it they took their several
stands in the -most conveniient places folr their purplose.
As they were waiting for an opportuinity to put their
dlesig in executio;!, a stranger having observed one of
4he conspirators, fell upon himin and slewv hima. Up7on

sought in vain for an opportunity of revenge, lhe chanced
to meet the murderer in the temple, lwho had planted
himself there for the above-mentionec! purpose.
13. Plutarch cannot forlear on this occasion, speaking
-vith a kind of rapture on the schemes of Providencc,
wvhich, in this particular, had so contrivedl it that the
stranger should, for so great a space of time, be debarred
the means of doing justice to his brother, till by the sanme
blow that revenged the death of one inliocent man, he
preserved the life of another.

I. IT is usuial for men, engaged in the same pursuits,
to be inquisitive aIfter tle conduct and fortune of eaclh

to you to read an account of the various changes which
lave appeared in part of' a lift devotedI to literature. 5My
narrative will not exhibit any g'reat variety of events, or
extraordinary revolutions; but may perhaps be not less
useful, because I shall relate iiothilg -which is noi likl. A
to happen to a thousaind otllers.
2. I wvas born lheir to a very small fortlune, and left b;
my father, wshoml I canrot renmember, to the ca!e of' tanr
-:ncle. He having no chillre'n, always treated ie as hi:-;
son, and findin, in me tllose qualities which old nalt'
easily discover in sprightly children when they happen to
love theim, declar-ed that a genius like mine should niever
be lost for want of cultivation.
3. fIe thlerefore placed me for tlhe ustal.'imne at a g'reat
school, and then seint me to the univerlsity, witll a larger
allowance than my own patrimony would have afforded,
that I might not keep meian company, but lealr: to become
my dignity when I shouldl be made Lord Chlancellor,
which he often lamented that the increase of his infirmities was very likely to preclude hmn firom seeing.
4. This exuberance of money displayed itself in gaiety
of appearance, and wantonness of expence, anid intlroduced me to the acquaintance of those whon the same superfluity of fortune had betrayed to the saime licence and
ostentation: young heir.s who pleased themselves with a
remlark very firequently- in their mouths, that though they
were sent by their fathers to the university, they wiere
not under the!iecessity of living by their learniiig.
5. Among mlen of tliii class I easily obtained thle reputat-ion of a great genius; and Awas persuaded that, with
such liveliness of imagination, and delicacy of sentiment,
I should never be able to submit to the drudgery of the law.
6. I therefore gave nmyself wholly to tlhe more airy and
elegant parts of learnings and was often so nluci elalted
with mlly superiotrit to the youths with wihomi I conversed,
that I began to lister, wN-ith great attention, to those iwho
c
[s'l  152  7Te You?ng,Gentlenzan and Lady's Monitor,
recommended to hae a wider and more conspicuous thea_
tre; and was particularly touchedl ivith aln observ~atioin
nmade- by one of my friends, that it was not by lingering
in the university that Prior became' armbassador, or A -
dison a secretary of state.
7. This desire was hourly increased by the solicitation
of my companions, who removing one by one to London,
as the caprice of their relations allowed them, or the legal
drismissiln fromn the hands of their gu~ardian ptut it in their
power, nlever failed to send an account of the beauty and
felicity of the nPeICw world, and to remonstrate how much'was lost by every hour's continuance in a place of retire-:nent and restraint.
8. My uncle, in the mean time, frequently harrassed
ime with rnonitory letters, which I some,times neglected to
open f'or a vweek after I received them, and generally read
in a tavern, with such comments as I might shen  how
much I was superior,to instructiol or advice. I could:ot but wonder, how a man confined to the countlry and
unacquainted with the present system of things, shotild
imagine himself qualified to instruct a rising genius, born
to give laws to the age, refine its state, and multiply its
pleasures.
9. The postman, however, still continued to bring me
nlew remonstrances; for my uncle'vwas very little depressed
by the ridicule and reproach. whicl he never heardc. But
men of parts have quick resentments; it was impossible
to bear his usurpations for evel;' and I resolved, once for
all, to make him an example to those ivho imagine themselves wise because they are old, and to teach young men,,
who are too tame under representation, in what manner

10. I therefore one evening took my pen in hand, arnd
after having aniiuated nlyself with a catcih, wrote a gcneral
answver to all Ihis precepts, witi suc ~i vivacity of.i turn,
such elkgance7,of irony, and such aspe ity of sarcasm, that
I convulsed a large company With universal laughter, dis*

and five days afterwards was answvercd, tlhat I mlust be

on any acknowledgment of his offence, when the splendor of my condition should induce him to wish for my
countenance.
12. I therefore went up to London before I had shewn the
alteration of my condition,by an v abatement of my way of
living, and was received by ail my academical acquaintance
with triumph and congratulation.  I was immediately introduced among tile its annd men of spirit; and, in a short
time, hadl civested m.self of ail my scholar's gravity, and
obtainedl the reputation of a pretty fellow.

the two keepers leaped out to seize her at the same time;
the one took her by the hand to convey her to fly8sium;
the other caught hold of her to carry her away to Erebus.
28. But Rhadamanthus observing an ingenuous modest)yin
her countenance and behaviour, bid them both let her loose,
and set her aside for a re-examination when he was more at
leisure. An old woman, of a proud and sour look, presented herself next at the bar, and being asked what she
had been doing? Truly, says she, I lived three score and
ten years in a very wicked world, and was so angry at the
behaviour of a parcel of young flirts, that I past most of
my last years in condemning the follies of the times.
29. I was every day blaming the silly conduct of people
about me, in order to deter those I conversed with from
falling into the like errors and miscarriages. Very well,
says ]zhadanianthu8s, but did youl keep the same watchful
eye over your own actions? VWhy truly, says she, I was so
taken up with publishing the faults of others, that I had
no time to consider my own.
30. MIadam, says Rh/idamnanthus, be pleased to file off to
the left, and make room for the venerable matron that
StanclIs behind you. Old gentlewoman, says he, I think
you are fourscore? You have heard the question, what
have you been doing so long in the world? Ah! sir, says
she, I have been doing what I should not have done, but
I had made a firm resolution to have changed my life, if
I had not been snatched off by an untimely end.
31. Aiadclam, says he, you will please to follow your
leader, and spying another of the same age, interrogated
her in the samne form. To which the matron replied, I
have been the wife of a husband who was as dear to me
in his old age as in his youth. I have been a mother, and
very happy in rny children, whom I endeavoured to bring
up in every thing that is good.
32. My eldest son is blest by the po6r, and beloved by
every one that kfiows him. I lived within my,own family, and left it much more wealthy than I found it. /Rhadamantzhus, who knew the value ofihe old lady, smiled up-,rk her in. such a manner, that thi:keeperof EJly8iuim, who

2. In the g-ay co;npany with which I was now united, I
fobund those allfurements and dte ligihts, which the friendship ot young1 me-n always at,I)rds; there was that openness, which naturally  produced confidlen.ce, that afil)'ility
whicih, i,n some m-easure, se,tened depn-idence, and that
ardor' of proe ssion which excited hope.
3. NVhen our hearts were- dilatedl w. ith merriment, promises were poured out with unlimited proftsion, and life
and fortune were I)ut a scanty sacrifice to fiiendshlir; bi/it
when the hour came, at which any effort was to be mnade,

r. Their kindess was indeed sincere, when thev promis-:i1 tti:,h had no intention to de:ceive; but the same juvenile
A aimintii wich k}inklfed their' benevolence, gave force in the
same proportion to every other passion, and I was forgotten as soon as any new pleasure seized on their attention.
5.,'Vagqrio told nme one evening, that all my perplexities slhould soon be at an end, and desired me, fromi. that
ins'&gt;:ut, to thro^w u-pon him all care of my fortune, for a
post of considerable value was that day become vacant,
and he knew his interest sufficient to procure it in the
morning. He desired me to call on him early, that he
might be dressed soon enough to wait on the minister before any other application should be made.
6. I came as he appointed, with all the flame of gratitu,de, and was told by his servant, that having founld at
his lodgings, when he came home, an acquaintance who
was going to travel, he had been persuaded to accompany him to Dover, and tlat they had taken post-horses two
hours before day.
7. I was once very near to preferment by the kindness of
Ccazrinus; who, at my request, weint to beg a place, which
he thought me likely to fill with great reputation, and in
which I shlould have rna.y opportunities of piromoting his
interest in return; and he pleased himself with imagining
the mutual benefits th?at we should confer, and the advances that we should malke by our united strenlgth.
8. Away, therefore, he went, equally warm with friendship and ambition, and l rft me to prepare acknowledgments agaiffst his return. At length he came back, and
told me that he had met in his way a party going to breakfast in the country, that the lacdies importuned him too
much to be refused, and that having passed the morning
with them, he was come back to dress himself for a ball,
tp,which he was invited for the evening.
9. I have suffered several disappointments from taylors
and perriwig-naakers, who, by neglecting to perform their
work, withheld my patrons fronl court, and once failed of
an establishment for life by the delay of a servant, sent to
a neighbouring shop to replenish a snuff-box.
10. At last I thought my solicitude at'an end, for anand Engfe'.h Teancher's Assistant~   5T7
rffice fell n11to thile gift of Hi/2/ocda:nzm's father, who being
thien in the country, could not very speedily fill it, and
wvhose fonidness would not have sufferedl him to re-fuse his
son a less reasonable request. HiifNodaimtus therefore set
forward with great expedition, and I expected every hour
an account of his success.
11. A long time I waited without any intelligence, but
at last received a letter friomi Newmarket,. by which I was
informed, that the races were begun, and I knew the vehemence of his passion too well to imagine that he could
refuse himself his favourite amusement.
12. You will not wonder that I was at last weary of the
patronage of youlng imen, especially as I found them not
generally to promise much greater fidelity as they advanced in life; for I observed that vwhat they gai7ned in steadiness, they lost in benevolence, and grew colder to nlmy
interest as they became more diligent to"promote their
13. 1 was convinced that their liberality was only profuseness, that, as chance directed, they were equally generous to vice and virtue, that they were warrn, but because they were thoughtless, and counted the- stfpport of a
friend- oinly amongst other gratifications of passion.
14. My resolutionl was now to ingratiate myself with
men whose reputation was established, whosehigh stations
enabled them to prefer me, and whose age exempted theml
from sudden changes of inclination; I was considered as a
man of parts, and therefore easily found admission to the
table of Htilar'ius, the celebrated orator, renowned equally
for the extent of his knowledge, the elegance of his diction, and the acuteness of his wit..15. Hilarius received mne with an appearance of great
satisfaction, produced to me all his friends, and directed
to me that part of his discourse in which he most endeavoured to display his imagination. I had now learned
my owr interest enough to supply him with opportunities
for smart remarks and gay sallies, which I never failed
to echo and applaud.
16. Thus I was gaining every hour on his affections,
till, unfortunately, when the assembly was more splendid
than usual, his desire of admiration prompted him to turxn
raillery uponI me. I bore it for some time wiith grcat583    2'wLe.%Zv,-g Gentleman mtUZ.Lady's Monitor,
subminzsion, and success encouraged hiim to redouble his
attacks-; at ast last my vanity prevailed over my, pludence  
1 retorted his irony with sluch spirit, that -ThiariuiZ,is uniaccustomaed to resistance, was disconcetted, and soon foulnd
means of convincing, me, that his purpose was nlit to encourage a rival, but to ibster a parasite.
17. I was then taken into-the familiarity of A...oJr!o, a.
nobleman eminient for judgment and criticism. - IHe had
contributed to my reputation, by the praises which he hatoften, besto-wed upon my writings, in which he ownled thI.iI
thierwere wee proofs of a genius that might rise high to degrees of excellence, iwhen time; or inolrmation, had reduced its exuberance.
18. He therefore required me to consutl!t himl before the
publicatioin of any nev performance, and commonly pro,posed ii-iumerable alterations, witloult sufficient attention
to the general desig-n, or regard to imy form of styler and
mode of ima'gi3nation.
19. But these corrections 1he never failed to press as indispensably neces.~ary, anld thought the least delay of compliance an act of rcbellion. The pride of an authilor i-madcl
this treatment:insufferable, atnd I thouglht any tyranny
easier to be-borne thia-n t-hat which tool from mre the use
of nmy understanding.
20. My next patron was Eutyches the statesman, who
was vwholly engaged in public affairs, and seemed to have
no ambition but to be powerful and rich. I found his
a-oiur mnore permanent than that of the others, for -there'was a certain price at which it might be bought; he allowed notling to humour or affection, butt was always
ready to pay iiberally for the service he required.
21. His demands were, indeed, very often suchl as vi'tue could not easily consent to gratify; but virtue is not
to be: -Consulted when men are to raise, their fortiunes by

w-rote in his defence, and was recompensed with a place,

became heir to a small fortune. I hacld resolution to'throw
ff the splendor which.reproached me to myself, and retire
to an humbler state, in which I am now endeavouring to
recover the dignity of virtue, and hope to make some reparation for my crimes and follies,by informing others wh6
inay be led after the same pageants, that they are about to
engage in a course of life, in whicll they are to purchase,
by a thousand miseries, the privilege of repentance.

What it is to see the WTorld; the Story of M~elissa.
RADIBLER, No. 75r
1. THE diligence with which you endeavour to cultivate the knowledge of nature, manners, and life; wvill perhaps incline you to pay some regard to the observations
of one who has been taught to know mankind by unwelcome information, and whose opinions are the result, not
of solitary conjectures, but of practice and experienlce.
2, I was born to a large fortune, and bred to the knowledge of those arts which are supposed to accomplish th'imind, and adorn the person of a woman. To these attainments, which custom and education almost forced up.on me, I added some voluntary acquisitions by the use
of books and the conversation of that species of men whom
the ladies generally mention with terror and aversion un-a
der the name of schelars,-but whoin I have foiund a harmless and inoffensive order of beings, noitso much wiserthan ourselves, but that they may'receive as well as comlmunicate knowledge, and more inclined, to degrade their
bwnYi character by cowardly submission, than to overbear
or oppress us w,iith their learning or tleir Wit.
3. Fromn these mnen,. howeveit, if they are- by kind treatmcnt encouraged to talk,something may be ga.incd, which,
embelished with elegancy, and softened by imodesty, will
always add ddignity and value to female conversation; andi
from my aclquaintance with the bookish part of the world,
I derived many principles of ju-dgment and maxims of
prudence, by which I was. -enabled.to dlawv upon myself
tlhe general regard in every pla.ce  concourse orpleasure~160   The Yeuz~ug Gentlemaan and lady's MAionitor,
4. My opinion was the great rule of applobatin, my
remarks we-re remembered by those vIwho desired the second degree of' faime, my nicin was studied, mly dtress
imiitated, my letter's were handed firom one famlily to another, and read by those who copied them as sent to
themselves; my visits were solicited as hlonours, and multitudes boasted of an intimacy with Melissa, who had only
seen me by accident, whose familiarity had never proceeded beyond the exchanlge of'a compliment, or return
of a courtesy.
5. 1 shall make no scruple of confessing that I was pleased with this universal veneration, because I always considered it as paid to my intrinsic qualities and inseparable
merit,-and very easily persuaded myself, that fortune had
no part in nmy superiroity.
6. Whien I looked upon iyW glass, I saw youth and
beauty, with health that might give me reason to'ope
their continuance: when I examnined my mind, I found
some strength of judgnmeat and fertility of fancvy; and was
tokl that every action rwas grace,. and that every accent
was persuasion.
7. In this-inanner nly life- passed like a continual triumph
amidst dcclamations, andl envy, and: courtship, and ca-;es-ses: to please Melissa was the general ambition, and
every stratagem of artful flattery was practised uplon me.
To beflattered is grateful, even when we know that our
praises are:not believed by those who pronoutnce thliem:
for they prove at least our power:, al:nd- shew that our favour is valued, since it is purchased by the meanness of
falsehood.
2.. But perhaps- the flatterer is not often detected, for an
honest mind is not apt to suspect, and no one exerts the
power of-: discernment with imtuch vi,,our Whe n self-love
fayvours the dec.eit.
9. The number of adorers, and the perpetual distraction
of my thoughts by new schemles of pleasures,revented
mre fiomn listening to any of tiose who crowd in multitudes to give girls advice, and kept me unmarried and
unenlgaged -to my twentv-se-venth vear, when, as I wias
towering in all the pride of uncontested excellency, with a
face vet little impaired, and al mind -hourly improving,
the failure of a fuid, in which nmy money was p!aced, reand -l;zn.ish Teacher's Assistant.  IG 6
tuced me to a trugal competency, -which allowed a little
beyond neatness and independence.
10. I bore the diminution of my riches without any olut*
rages of sorrow, orTpusillanilllity Of dejection. Indeed I
did not know how much I had lost, for having always
heard and thought more of my wit and beauty, than of
rml fortune, it did not suddenly enter my imagination, that
Melissa. could sink beneath her established rank,while her
formry- and hel mind continied the same; that she should
cease to raise admiration, b)ut by ceasing-to deserve it, or
feel any stroke but fiom the hand of time.
I 1. It iwas in my power to have concealed the loss, and'to have married, by continuing the same appearance, with
all the credit of my original fortune; but I was not so far
sunk in mny esteem, as to submit to the=baseness of fratuid,
or Ato desire any other recommenldation than sense and4
virtue.
12. I therefore dismissed mny equipage, sold those ornaD
ments whichl were become unsuitable to my new condi.
tiol-, alld appeared among those with whom I used to
converse A-ith less glitter, but with equal spirit.
1 3. I.tound mnyself received at every tisit with soriow
ecyond what is naturally felt for calamities in wbhich we
have no part, and vwas entertaiined with condolence and
consolation so frieqtuently repeated, that my friendIs plainly
consulted rather tlheir own gratification, than - my rel ef
14. Somle fiom-that time refulsed imy acquaintanle, and
forebore withou-t-an y provocation, to repay ny visits; some
visited me, but after a longer interval than usu-l.1, and
every return was still with more delay; ner did any of
imy female acquaintalces fail to introduce the miention o'f
y -nmisfortunes, to comipare my plesent and forime condition, to tell me how much i-t must trouble me-to want t;hat
splendor which I becanme sowell; to look atpleasures,which
I had formerly enjoyed, and to sink to a level with those by
whom I had been considered as movillg in a higher sphere,
and who had hitherto approachled nme, with reverence and
submission, whicJh I was now no longer to expect.
15. Observations like these are comionly nothing better than covert insults, which serve to give-vent to tle
flatulence of pride, but they are now and then imprudently
uttered- by honesty and bcelnevolence, and inflict pain wherel62   The Young Gentletwran and Lady's Monitor,
kindness is intended; I will, thereforle, so far maintain
my antiquated claim to politeness, as to venture the establishment of this rule, that xo one ought to remind another
of misfortunes of which the sufferer does not complain, and
which there are no means proposed of alleviating.
16. You have no right to excite thoughts which necessarily give pain whenever they return, and which, perhaps, might not have revived but by absurd andcl unseasPnable compassion.
17. My endless train of lovers immediately withdrew
without raising any emotions. Thle greater part had indeed always professed to court, as it is termned upon the
square, had enquired imy fortune, and offered settlements;
these undoubtedly had a right to retire without censure,
since they had openly treated for money, as necessary to
their happiness, and who can tell how little they wanted
any other portion?
18. t have always thought the clamours of women unrea onable, who imagine themselves injured, b1ecause the
nmen who followed them u,pon the supposition of a greater
fortune,reject them when they are discovered to have iess.
I'have never known any lady, who did not think wealth a
title to some stipulations in her favour; and surely wlhat
is claimed by the possession of money, is justly forfeited
by its loss.
19. She that has onlce demanded a settlemnent, has allow-ed the importance of fortune; and when she cannot
shew-pecuniary merit, why should she think her cheapner
obliged to purchase?
20. My lovers were not all contented -with silent desertion. Some ofthem revenged the neglect which they hlad
formerly endured by wvanton and superfluous insults, and
endeavoured to mortify me, by paying in my presence
those civilities to other ladies, which weire once devoted
only to me;
21. But as it had been my rule to treat men according
to the rank of their intellect, I had never suffered any one
to waste his life in suspense who could have employed it
to better purpose, and had therefoie no enemies but coxcombs, whose-resentment and respect were equally below
my consideration.
22, The only paia which. hve felt from degradation; isand if,'gltish Teacher's Assisfantm;  1 6
the, loss of that influence which I have always exerted on
thle side of virtue, in the defence of innocence, and the assertion of truth. I now find my opinions slighted, my
sentiments criticised, and my arguments opposed by-those
that used to listen to me without reply, avnd struggle tot
be first in expressing' their conviction.
23. The female disputants have whiolly thrown off my
authority, and if I endea:our to enforce my reasons by
an appeal to the scholars that happen to be present, the
wretches are certain toPay their court by sacPificing me
and my system to a finer gown; and I am every hlour insulted with contradiction by cowards, who could never find
till lately, that Melissa was liable to error.
24. There are two persons only wliom I cannot charp,e

gether with thle I2?nzensity-/ of his Wrks..
1. I WVAS yesterday about sun-set'walking i-.the opetn
fields, till the night insensibly fell upon m-e. I at first
amused lmyself with all the richness antd variety of colours,and Eng'ish Teacher's Assistant.    1 1
33. A young woman observing that this officer, who
conducted the happy to Elysiuzm, was so great a beautefier,
longed to be in his hands, so that, pressing through the
croud, she was the next that appeared at the bar, and being asked what she had been doing the five and twenty
years that she had passed in the world, I have endeavoured, says she, ever since I came to the years of discretion, to make myself lovely, and gaia admirers.
34. In order to do it I past my time in bottling up Maydew, inventing white-washes, mixing colours, cutting out
patches, consulting my glass, suiting my complexion,
tearing off my tucker, sinking my stays-Rhadamanthu&amp;,
without hearing her out, gave the sign to take her off.
Upon the approach of the keeper of Ere6us her coloLr
faded, her face was puckered up with wrinkles, and her
whole person lost in deformity.
35. I was then surprised with a distant sound of a whole
tloop of females that came forward laughing, singing, and
dancing. I was very desirous to know the reception theywould meet with, and withal was very apprehensive that
Rhadramanthus would spoil their mirth; but at their nearer approach the noise grew so very great that it awakened me.
36. Employment of time is a subject that, from its importance, deserves your best attention. Most young gentlemen have a great deal of time before them, and one
hour well employed, in the early part of life, is more valuable and \vill be of greater use to you, than perhaps four
and twenty, some years to come.
37. What ever time you can steal from company ai*1
from the sttldy of the world (I say company, for a knovledge of life is best learned in valious companies) employ
it in serious reading. Take up some valuable book, and
continue the reading of that book till you have got through
it; never burden your mind with more than one thing at
a timel: and in reading this book do not run it over superficially, but read every passage twi;e over, at least do not
pasoau to a second till you thoromuhly understand the
first, nor quit the book till you are m,aster of the suba
ject fior unless you do this, you mayread it through, and
mot remember the contents of it for a- week.
383. The books I vwotdl paficttlarly -recommnend, are
2  164   The Young Genztlemnan and Lacly's Monitor,
which appeared in the western parts of heaven; in proportion as they faded away and went out, several stars and
planets appeared one1 after another, -till the whole firmainent xvas in a glow. The blueness of the xther was exceedingly heiglhtened and enlivened by the season of the
year, and by the rays of all those luminaries that nassed
tliroughl it.
2, The Galaxy appeared in its most beautiful white.
To complete the scene, the iulil moion rose at length in that
clouded majesty, iwhich /Iilto?z takes notice of, and opened
to the eye a new picture of nature, which was more finely
shaded, and disposed among softer liglhts, than that which
the sun had before discovered to us.
3. As I was surveying tlie moon, walking in her brightness, and taking her progress almong the constellattions, a
thouglht rose in me which I believe very often perplexes
and disturbs men of serious'an(d contemplative nattlres.
David himself fell into it in that reflection, WlVen I consider the heave7s, the work of thy fingers, the moonz and starr
which thou hast ordazined; wthat is man)C that thou art mind.
Jul of hi-m) and the son o' ma?n, that thou?reg'?adest him.'
4. In the same manner,when I consider that infinite host
of stars, or, to speak more- philosophically, of suns, wrho
tvere then shining upon me,, with those innumerable sets
of planets or -orlds, which were moving round their respective suns; when I still enlarged the idea, and supposed
another heaven of suns and worlds rising still above this
which he had discovered, and these still enlightened by a
superior firmament of luminaries, which are planted at so,great a distance, that they may appear to the inhabitants
of the former as the stars do to us; in, short, while I pursued this thought, I could not but reflect oin that little insignificant figure which I myself bore amidst the imr.
miensity of Gocl's works.
5. W\Vere the sun, which enlightens this part of the creation, with all the host of planetarly worlds that move about
him, utterly extinguished and annihilated, they would not
be missed, more than a grain of sand upon the sea-shore,
The space they possess is so exceedingly little in conmparison of the Mwhole, that it would scarce make a blank in
the creation. The chasm would be imperceptible to anl
eye thlat could take in the whole compass of nature, andaitd Tg'tis/z Teacher' A-ssistant.   1 65
pass fi'om one end of the creation to the other; as it is
possible there may be such a sense in ourselves hereaftelr
or in creatures which are at present ilore exalted thanr
ourselves.
6. XVe see many stars by the help of glasses, which we
do not discover wvith our naked eyes; and the finer our
telesconpes are, the nolre still are our discoveries. Huygenzisu8,artries his thougiht so far, that he does not think it
imipos:ible there may be star's whose light is not yet travelled clown to us, since their first creation.  There is no
question but the universe.has certain bouiids set to it; but
wllhen we consid,er that it is the work of infinite power,
prompted by irfinite goodness, wvith an inlfinite space to
exert itself in, how can our imagination set anly boundsto it!
7. To return, therefore,to my first thought, I could not
but look upon myself with secret horror, as a being that
was not worth the smallest regard of one who lhad so great
a work under his care and superintendency. I wasr afiraid.
of being overlooked amidst the immensity of nature, and
lost among that infinite variety of creatures, which in all
probability swarm through all these immeasurable regions
of matter.
In order to recover myself from this mortifying thiought,
I consider that it took its rise from those narrow conceptions which we are apt to maintain of the divine nature.
WVe ourselves cannot attend to many different obiects at
the saie timel   If we are careful to inslpet oQae tvhil's
we must of course neglect others.
8. This imperfectionv lwhich we observe in outselves, is
an imperfection that cleaves in some degree to creatures
of the h1ig-hest capacities, as they are creatures, that is, beings of finite and limited natures. The presence of every
created being is confined to a certain mneasureC of space,
ancld consequently his observation is stinted to a certain
number of objects. The sphere in whichl wne move, andI
act, Ind understand, is of a wider circumfeyence to one
creature than.another, according as we rise one above; another in the scale of existence.
9. But the widest of these our spheres has its circumference. YWhen, therefore, we reflect on the divine nature, we are so used and accustomed to this imnperfection166   The YOua-ng Gentlczman and Lady's TMonitor,
in ourselves, that we cannot forbear in some measure as.
cribing' it to him in whom there is no shadow of imperfection. Oilr reason indeed ascribes that his attributes
arTe infinite, but the poorness of our conlceptions is such,
that it cannot forbear setting bounlds to every thingl it contemplates, till our reaso-n coimes again to:our succour, and
l;hromvs down all those little prejudices which rise in us:unawares, and are natural to the min(d of man.
1'o Wie shall therefore utterly extinguish this melan~choly thought, of our being overlooked by outr Maker in'
the multiplicity of his works, and the infinity of those objects ahmong which he seems to be incessantly employed,
if we consider, in the first pllace, that he is onuipresent;
kind in the seconld, that he is omniscieirt
If we consider him in his omnipresence; his being
passes through, actuates and supports the whole frame of
Iature. His creation, and every part of it, is full of him.
I 1. There is nothing he has made, that is either so distant,sso little,or so inconsiderable, which he does not essentially inhabit. His substance is within the substance of
every being, whether material or inmmaterial, and is inti-mately present to it, as that being is to itself.- - It- would
be an imperfection in him, were he able to remove out of
rone place int6 another, or to withdraw' himself from any
t.hing he has created, or from any part of that space vWhich
is diffused and spread abroad to infinity. In short,'to
speak of him in the language of the oldc philosophers, He
~-:?, -wihbose centre is every wher- and'fis' rcum
ference no where.
12. In the second place, he is omniscient as Nwell as
omni-ipresent. His o;nniscience, indeed, necessarily and
naturally flows firom his omnipresence. He cannot but
be- conscious of every motionl that arises in the.whole ma-.terial world, which he thus essentially perv,les; and of
every thlought that is Stirring in:the intellectual world, to
every pairt of which he is thus intimately united. Several,moralists have'considered the creation as the ternple of
CGod, which he has built wlrith lis owln hands, and which
is filled withX his presence.
13. Others have considered infinite space as the rec,reptacle, or rather the habitationt of the Almighty; but
the&lt; nh.lest and most csalted way'of' consida.erin tbis ihl.a?2d ngZiSh Teacher's.Assistant,   161
finite space, is that of Sir Isaac Xew7Uton, who calls it the
sensorilum of the Godhead. Brute s and men have their
sensoria, or little senzsoriuzns, by which they apprehend the
presence and perceive the actions.of a few objects that
lie contiguous to them. Their knowledge and apprehension turn within a very narrow circle. But as (Cod Almig-hty cannot but perceive and know every thing in which
he resides, infinite.space gives room to infinite knowledge,
and is, as it were, an organ to omniscience.
14. Were the soul separate-from the body, and with one
glance of thoulght shou~ld- staxt beyond the bounds of the.creation; shoulld it for millions of years continue its progre s throtuglh infinite space with the same activity, it
would still find itself within the embraces of its Creator,
and encompassed round with the iinmmensityr of the Godhead.  WVhile we are in the body, he is not less present
wi,ith.us because he is concealed i t omeus s 0a- that i Anew
where I might find him7?  says JobI. _Behold I go f,rnJvard,'
biut he is not there; zand backvar-d, b6t tt I cann,lot fierteive
him:; on the Ieft hacnd, where he does work, bzi t I can?mot hbc
holcl him: he hideth hi?nsef on the right ha nd, that I cannot
qee himzx. In slhort, reason as ~ell as revelation assures us,
that he cannot bo ab-sent from us, notwithstanding he is
ulndiscovered by us.
15. In this consideration of God Almighty's omnipre.
sedfce and omniscience, every uncomfortable thought vanishes. He cannot but regacrd every thing that has beinisr
especially such of:his creatures who fear they are not regarded by him. He is privy to all their thoughts, and to
that anixiety of he-art in particular, which is apt to trouble
them on this occasion; for, as it is impossible he should.
overlook anly of his creatures, so we may be confident that
he regardls, with an eye of mercy, those ivwho endeavour
to recommlend themselves to his..otice, and in ul.feigned
ihumility of he1art think themselves unLworthy thalt he
shoulid be minldful of them.

cc,asiOl to ~oUns(.1der the ubiquity of th' e Godhefad,  ld168'T/e IYaoug Genzt?'Lcan,:and Ladl's Motiitur,
at the same time to shew, that as he is present to everey
thinIg, he cannotb lute attentivle to every thing, and privy
to ill the modes and p:rtts of its existence; or, in other
words, thathis omniscience and omnipresence are co-existept, and run together through the whole infinlitude of space.
2. This consideration mighlt furnish us -with many incentives to dexvotion, anrd motives to-- morality; but as this
sutbject has been handled by several excellent writers, I
shall consider it in' a light'wherein I 4have not-seen it
placed.by others.
Fi'rst, How disconsolate is tthe condition of an intellectual being who is thus present with his Maker, but at the
same time receives no extraordinary benefit or advantage
from this -his presence:!
3. Secondly, How deplorable is the condition of an intellectual`being, vwho feels no other effects from this his
presence, Lbut such as plroceed from divine wrath and indignation'
T/ri:dlyz, Hiow happy is the conditirn of that intellectual
being, who is sensible of his Maker's presence from the
secret effects o:d his mercy and loving kindness!
4. Einb, l how disconsolate is -the condition of an intellectual being who is thus present with his Maker, but at
the same time receives no extraor'dinary benefit- or advaintage from'this his presence!I Every particle of matter is
cti uated by this A     BlmighltyBeiing.wh,ich passes through it.
The heavens and the earth, the stars.and planets, move,
and gravitate by virtue of this great principle within them.
All the dead parts of nature are invigorated by the presence of their Creator, andt made capable of exerting their.respective qualities.
S. The severa:linstincts in the brute creation do,likewise
operate and work towards -the several ends which are agreeablje to them, by this divine energy. Man only, who
does not co-operate with his holy spirit, and is unattentive
to his presence, receives none.of these advantages from-it,.which are-- perfective of- his nature, and. necessary to his.well-being. The divinity is with him, -and in him, and
every where about him,,but of no-advantage to him.
6. It is the same thing to a mah without religion, -as if
there-vwere no God in the world. It- is'indeed impossible
for.an in.finite Being to Tremove himself fromn any of his,and EizgV.liSd TeacTice's' Ass-stant. i' 69
creatures; but thoutgh he cannot withdraw hi.s,essence
fi'om us, which would argue an imperfection in him, he
can withdraw from us all the joys and consolationj of it.
His presence may, pella-ps, be necessary to support us
in our existence; but he may leave this our existence to
itself, with regard to our "nappiness or miservy.
7.,For, in this sense, he may cast us away from his
presence, and take his holy spirit from us., This single
consideration one would thi-n3 sLfficient to mlake us ope
our hearts to all those infusions ofjoy.and gladness which
are so near at lihand, and ready to be poured in upon us  
especially when wve consider, secondly, the deplorable con;
dition of an intellectual beinlg who feels no other effects
-romn his Maker's presence, but such as'proceedt from dic
vine wrath and inrlignation!
8. We may assure omuselves, that the great Author ct
Nature, will not always be as one.who is ifidifflerent to any
of his creatures. Those who will not:feel him in his love,
will be sure at length to feel him in Ihis displeasure. Aind
low dreadful is the condition of that creattire who is only
-eensible of the being of his Creator by what he suffers trom
him! He is as essentially prese-nt in hell as in heaven; but
"the inhabitants of those accursed places behold him only in
his wrath, and shrink within the flames to conceal themselves fiom him. It is not in the power of ilmagination to
conceive the fearfil effects of Omnipotence incerlsed.
9. But I shall only consider the wretchedness of an in-,tellectual being, who, in this life, lies under the displeasure of him, that at all times, and in all places, is intimately united with him. H-fe is aible to disquiet the soull
and vex it in all its faculties.  lie can hinder-any of the
greatest comforts of life from refreshing us, and give an
edge to every one ofits,:slightest calamities.
10. WVho then can bear the thoug'ht of-beirig an outcast
fromi his,presence, that is, from the comforts of it, or of
feeling it- only in its terrors? how pathetic is that expostulation.of Job, when for the real trial of his patience, he
wasmade-to look upon himself in this deplorable condition1i
Wtbhy ttast thou set mze as a-n-ark againzst thee, so that I am
become a burden to my,nelf?  But tlhirdly, how happy is the
condition of that intellectual being, who is sensible of his
Maker's presence from the secreteffects of his mercy.and
loving kindness!170  The'Youlig Gcntemanz anzld Llady's Monitor,
11.'lle blessed in heaven blehold him face to face, that
is, are as sensible of his presence as we are of the presence.of any person whom we look upon with our eyest, There,is doubtless'-a faculty in spirits,:by which they apprehend,one another, as our senses do material objects; and tliere
is no question but our souls, when they ar; disembodied,,or placed in glorified bodies, will by this faculty, in whatever space they reside, be always sensible of the divine
presence.
12. WVe who have this veil of flesh stalnding between us
land the world of spirits, miust be content to know the spirit
of God is presenlt with us, by the effects which he produceth in use Our outward senlses are too gross to apprlehend
him;'we may howrever taste and see hoiw gracious he is, by
his influence upon our minds, by those virtuous thoughts
vwhich he awakens in us, by those secret comLforts and refreshmllents which he conveys into ou;r souls, and by1 those
ravishing joy-s.and inward satisfactions which are perpetually. springing up, and diffusing themselvres among all the
thotughts of good men.
13.- He is lodged in our very essence, and is as a soul
ivithin the soul to irradiate its understanding, rectify its
wvill, purify its passions, and enliven all the power's of man.
How happy therefore is an intellectual being, who by prayer and meditation, by virtue and goQd wolrks, opens this
communication between God and his own soul!- Tllough
the whole creation frowns upon him, and all nature look's
black about him, he has his light -and support within him,
that are ablMe to cheer his mind, and bear him up in the
midst of all those horrors which encompass him.
14, He knows that his lielper is at hand, and is always
nearer to him than.any thing else can be, which is capable
of annoying or terrifying him. In the midst of calumny
or contempt, he attends to that Being.who whispers better things within his soul, and whom he looks upon as his
defender, his glory and.the lifter up of his -head. In his
deepest solitude and retirement, he knows that he is in
company wi'th the greatest of beings: and perceives Within himselfsucli real sensations of his presence, as are
mnore delightful than any thing that can be met with in
the conversations of his creatures.,15 Even inr the hour of d,eath; he considerl the pains ofand 1~nglisJi reacher-'s Ass,istan't.   I 7I.is dlissolution to be niothinig els'e but the breaking down

sigh,t of that Beinig wvho is alway prset xvith him, and
is about to mani-fe-st itselfL to hlim- in fulness of Joy,
16. If- we would be thus happy and thus~ sensible o-f o'uw
Afaker's presence, fromi the secret effects of his merey anid
goodness, we mtust keep such awvatch over all our thoughts,
that, i-n the lanigiage of the scripture, His -soul may hi-ave

-JCONSIDERED. in mny two las~t letters, th at awvful
and tremendouls -ujet     buicuitvwor Omnipr'esence of
the-Divine Being. I have shewn that'-he -is equally presetit
i-n all plcs throughout the whiole eXtent of infinite Space,.
This -doctrine is so agreeable to reason, that we meet wt
it in the writings of the enlightened, heathenis, as T -i migt
shew at large, Were itL not alread y done by othi er hands.
BUtLthough the Deity.be thus essentially present-throUg'h
-all the imux1nenisity of space, there is one part of it in whichhle discovers hiraself in a most tran sceidanit -and -visible,glory.
2. This is that place - which is marked out in s'cripture
un-der the differenit appellations of Paradire, the third Heaven,
the throne of God, an7d tie habitation of his -glory. It is here
wbhl~re the gl6orified royQQr ait rsia'es, and whera172   The Young Gentdemnan and Lady's Monitor,
all the celestial hierarchies, and innumerable hosts of an,
gels, are represented as- perpetually surrounding the seat
of God with hallelujahs and hymlns of praise. This is
that presence0f God which some of the divines call his
glorious, and others his majestic presence.
3. He is indeed as essentially present in all other places
as in this; but it is here wlhere he resides in a sensible
nmagnificence, and in the midst of all the.;e splendors
which can affect the imagination of created beings.
It is very remaiikable that this opinion of God Almigha
ty's presence in heaven, whether discovered by the light
of nature, or by a general tradition from our first parents)
prevails among all the nations of the world, whatsoever
different notionls they entertain of the Godhead,
4. If you look into'Honmerj that is, the most ancient of
the G-reek writers, you see. the Supreme power seated in
the heavens, and encompassed with inferior deities, among
whom the muses are represented as singing incessantly
about his throne. WVho does not here see the main strokes
and outlines of this great truth we are speaking of?
5. The same doctrine is shadowed out in many other
heathen authors, tho-ugh at the. same time, like several
other revealed trtuths, dashed and adulterated with a mixture of fables and human inventions. But to pass over
tthe notions of the Greeks and Romans, those more enlightened parts of the.pagan world, we find there is scarce a
people anmong the late discovered nrations who are not
trained up in an opinion that heaven is the habitation of
the divinity whom thevy orship.
6. As in nloonzcz's temple there was the Sanctumz Sancz
toruni, in which a visible glory appeared among the figlures
of the cherubims, and into which none but the high-priest
himself was permitted to enter, after having made an atone,mnent for the sins of the people; so, if we consider this
whole creation as one great temple, there is in it the Holy
of Holies, into which the higlh-priest of our salvation entered, ancd took his place among angels and archangels, after
having made a propitiation for the sins of mankind.
7. With how much Skill must the throne of God be erected? AVith what glorious designs is that habitation beautified, which is contrived and built by hlim who inspired Hiram
svith wisdom? How great must-be the majesty of that place,and EJnglish Teacher's Assistant.   173
where the whole art of creation has been employed, and
where God has chosen to shew himself in the most magni?
ficent manner? /VWhat must be the arlchitecture of infinite
power under the direction of divine wisdom? A spirit cannot but be transported after an ineffable' manner with the
sight of those objects, which were made to affect him by that
being who knows the inward firame of a soul, ald how to
please and ravish it-in all its most secret powers and faculties.
8. It is to this niajestic presence of God we may apply
those beautifuil expressions in holy writ: Behold evenz to
the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars. are not zPure in
his siglt.'The light of the sun, and all the glories of the
world in which we live, are but as weak. and sickly glimmerings, or rather darkness itself, in cominarison of those
splendors which encompass the throne of God.
9. As the glory of this place is' transcendent beyond
imagination, so probably is the extent of it. There is
light behind light, and glory within glory. Hovw far that
space may reach, in which God' thus appears in perfect
najesty, wte calnnot possibly concei,e'- Though it is not
infinite, it may be indefinite; and though not imnmeasurable in itself, it may be so with regard to any created eye
or imagination. If he has made these lower regions of
matter so inconceivably wide and magnificent for the habitatiolln of mortal and perishable beings, how great may we
suppose the courts of his house to be, where he makes his
residence in a mnore especial manner, and displays himself
in the fulness of his glory, zamong an innumerable coimpany of angels, and spirits of just men made perfect!
10. This is certain, that our imaginations cannot'be
raised too high, when we thinik on a place mTwhere omnipotenice and omniscience have so signally exerted themselves,
because that they are able to produce a scene infinitely
more great and glorious than what we are able to imagine.
11. It is -not impossible but at the consummation of all
things, these outward apartments of natul'e, which are now
suited to.those beings who inhabit'them, may be taken
in and added to that glorious place of whvich I am here
speaking.;; and by that means made a proper habitation
for beings wvho are' exempt'from inortality, and cleared
of their imperfectiofis: for so the scripture seems to ilntimaste, when tt speaks of new heavens and of a new earth,
wherein dwe,leth righlteousnesse12    The Young Gentleman a,ad Lady's Monitor,
Cardinal Retz's maxims, Rochefoucault's moral reflections, Bruyere's characters, Fontenelle's plurality of
worlds, Sir Josiah Child on trade, Bollinbroke's works;
for style, his remarks on the history of England, under
the name of Sir John Oldcastle; Puffendorff's Jus Gentium, and Grotius de Jure Belli et Pacis: the last-two are
well translated by Barbeyrac. For occasional half hours
or less, read the best works of invention, wit and humor;
but never waste your minutes on trifling authors, either
ancient or modern.
39. Any business you may have to transact, should be
done the first opportunity, and finlished, if possible, without interruption; for by deferring it we may probably
finish it too late, or execute it indifferently. Now, business of any kind should never be done by halves, but every
part of it should be well attended to: for he that does
business ill, bad better not do it at all. And in any point
which discretioa bids you pursue, and which has a manifest utility to recommend it, let not difficulties deter you;
rather let them animate your industry. If one metho(l
fails, try a second and a third. Be active, persevere, and
you will certainly conquer.
40. Never indulge a lazy disposition, there are few
things but are attended with some difficulties, and if you
are frightened at those difficulties, you will not complete
any thing. Indolent minds prefer ignorance to trouble;
tiley look upon most things as impossible, because perhaps they are difficult. Even an hour's attention is too
laborious for them, and they would rather content themselves with the first view of things than take the trouble
to look any farther into them. Thus, when they come

then, that you do not get the appellation of indolent, and,
if possible, avoid the character of frivolous, For,

12. I have only considered this glorious place with regard to the sig-ht and imagination, though it is highly'probable, that our other senses may here likewise enjoy their
highest gratifications. There is nothing which more ra-vishes and transports the soul, than harmony; and we hlave
great reason to believe, from the description of this place in
holy scripture, that this is one of the entertainments of it.
13. And if the soul of man can be. o wonderfully affectedc with those strains of music, which human art is
capable of producing, how much more will it be raised
and elevated by those, in which is exerted the whole power of larmony! The senses are faculties of the human
soul, though they canrnot be employed, during this our
vital union, without proper instruments in the body.
14. TWbhy therefore should we exclude the satisfaction
of these faculties, which we find by experience are inlets
bf great pleasure to the usoul, finom among these entertainments which are-to make our happiness hereafter?-'hy
should we suppose that our hearing and seeing will not be
gratifiedby those objects -which are most agreeable to themn
and wlhichl they cannot meet with in those lower regions of
nature; objects, whichz neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard,?nor canl it enter into the heart of man to conceive  
15. I knew a man inz Ch/rist (says St. Paul, speaking o,f
himself) above fourteen year-s ago (whe.t/ier in the body, I
caznnot tell; or uwhether out of the body, I caniZot tell: Godknoweth) such na one cauguht, zui to the te tird heaven. Jid I
knew sutch a mzan (whether in the body or out of the body, I
canmnot tell: God knoweth) hoiw that he was caugJht ui inzto
IParadise, and hearid Wunszeakqble ivords, which it is not po8sible for a man to Utter.
16. By this is meaint that what he leard was so infinitely
difi'erent fi:om any thing which he had hearcl ii this world,
that it was impossible to express it in such words as might
convey a notion of it to' his hearers.
It is very natural for us to take delight in inquiries con,~
celning any foreign country, where we are some time or
other to make our abode; and as we allhope tobe admrittede
iinto this glorious place, it is-both a laudable and useful
curiosity, to get what,information we can of it, while we.make use of revelation for our guide.

Cexcel one eanotaher in perfection, they are not admnitted
nearer to the throne of the Al-m.ighty, and enioy g'reater

18. V;vhether the-ire are not solemn times and occasions,
v len all the multitude of heaven celebrate the pmesence o`
the*ir Malea!er, in more extraordinary forms of praise and
adoration; as Al dam1, though he had continued in a state of

I. A LEW~D younV  g fellow seeing an aged hermit goL
by hlim barefoot, Fathe?r, says he, you acre inz a vcrry mis-.
able condition if thzere-- is not another 4world. 2Truye son, said
the hermit; but what is thy condition if there is.? Man is a
creature designe-d for --two different states of being', ol 1rather, for two different lives. His first life is short and
transient; his second permanent and lasting.
2.'The question we are all concerned in is this, in which
of these two lives is our chief interest to make ourselves
happy   or in other words, whether we should endleav.our
to secure to ourselves the pleasure and gratification of a
iife which is uncertain ancl precarious, and at its utmnost?ength of a very-i'nonsiderable'duration; or to secure to.
ourselves the pleasure of a lifi that is fixed and settled,
and will never end? Evelry man, uipoln the first hearing of
this question, knows very wvell lwhich side of it lie ought
to close with.
B3.    h3l} how everl right we arle in theory, it is plain that.n practice we adhere to tile wroongside of the question.
WVe make provisions for this life as though it were lnevec,
to have an end, andl for the otherl life as thouigh it Nwere
never to have a beginning.
Should a spirit of superior rank, who is a stranger to human nature, accidentally alight upon the earth, and take a
survey of its inhabitants, what would his notions of us be?
4. Wvaould not he think tbat we were a species of beinllgs
made for quite difierent ends and purposes than what we
really are? Must not he imagine that we were placed in
this world to get riches and honours? Would he not thinik
that it -was our duty to toil after wealth, and station, aLnd
title? Nay,  would not he beli've we were forbidden povrerty
by threats of eternal punishment, and enjoined to pursue
our pleasures under pain of damnation I He would certainly imagine that we were influenced by a schem e of
duties quite opposite to those which are indeed prescribed
to us.
5. And truly, accorlding to such an imagination, he must
onclu.de that we are a species of the maost obedient cprea?nzd PEzgis, Teacher's Assistantlt
tires in the universe; that we are constant to our educty
Eadtil that vwe keep a steady eye on th-e end for which ive
were sent hither.
But how great would be his astonishment, when he
learnt that we were beings not designed to exist in this
world above threescore and; ten years; and that the greatest part of this busy species fall short even of that age?
6, tIow would he be lost in horror and amiiration,
when he should know that this set of creatures, who lay
out all their endeavours for this life, which scarce deserves
the name of existence, when, I say, he should novw that
this set of creatures are to exist to all eternity in another
life, for which t;hey msnake no preparations?
7. Nothing can-be a greater disgrace to reason than that
~men., who are persuaded of these two different states of
being, should be perpetually enmployed in providing for a
life of threescore and ten years, and neglecting to make
provision for that which, after many myriads of years,
will be'still new,, and still beginning,; especially when we
consider that our endeavours for mnaking ourselves grea-t,
or rich, or honourable, or whatever- else we place our
happilless in, may, after all, prove unsuccessful; whereas
if we constantly and sincerely endeavour to make ourselves
happy in the otlher life, wev are sure that our endeavours
wiil stuiceed, and that we shall not be disappointed of our
hope.
8. The ifolloing question is started by one of the schoolr;,en: Suplposing the whole bocty of the earth were a great
ball or miass of the finest sand, jnd tlhat a single glrain or
particle of this sandl should be annihilated every tlhousand
yeal-,  Sutpposing- thien that you hadcl it in your choice to
be happy all the while thiis- porodigious mass of sanzd was
consuming by this slow method till there was not a grain
of it left, on condition you were to be miserable for ever
a3fter; or supposing' that you might h)e -happy for ever after,
on condl1ition you would be miserable till thle wvhole mass
of sand were -thius alnihilated at the rate of one sand in a
thousand yeC,ars: which of these two cases -would you make
your clloice  
9. It mlust be confessed itn this case, so many thousands
oF years are to the imagination as a kind of eternyit,thoug'h
n reality tihey do not be ar so g'reat a proportion to that

would be the bette' par t in this choice.

9. Th'ere is not, in my opinion, a more pleasing and
triumlpi:hant consideration in religion. than this of the' perpe-ual pirogress which the soul'makes towards the perfecticn
of its nat-ilre, without ever arriving at a period in it.. To
look upon the soul as going on from strength to strength,
to considter that she is to shine for ever with new- accessions,of glory, and brighten to all eternity; that she wvill be still
adding- virteti to virtue, and knowledge to knowledge; carvies in it something wonderfully agreeable to that ambi-i
tion which is natural to the mind of man. Nay, it must
be a p.rospect pleasingg to God  imself, tosee his creation
Ao'r ever beautifying his eyes, and drawing nearer to him,
by greater degrees of rese.mblance.

M.desty.
MODESTY is the citidel of beauty and virtue. The
first of all virtues is innocence; the second is modesty.
1. Modesty is both in its source, and in its consequence,
a very great happiness to the fair possessor of ii:; it arises
from a fear of dishonor, and a good conscience, and is
followed immediately, upon its first appearance, with the
reward of hoinor and esteem, paid by all those who discover it in any body living.
2. It is indeed a virtue in a woman (that might otherwise be very disagreeable to one) so exquisitely delicate,
that it excites in any beholder, of a generous and manly
disposition, almost all the passions that he would be apt to
conceive for the mistress of his heart, in variety of circumstances.
3. A woman that is modest creates in us an awe in her
company, a wish for her welfare, a joy in her being actually happy, a sore and painful sorrow if distl'ess should
come upon her, a ready and willing heart to give her conIsolation, and a compassionate temper towards her, in every
little accident of life she undergoes; and to sum up all in
one word, it causes such a kind of angelical love, even to
a stranger, as good natured brothers and sisters usually
bear towards one another.
4. It adds wonderfully to the make of a face, and I have
seen a, pretty well turned forehead, fine set eyes, and what
~yo~u.r4ets call, a row of pearl satin coral, shewn by a
]Pre*4 expansion of two velvet lips that covered them

1. I MU,' ST confess I am infinitely delighlted with thosle.
s peculatdions, of nature which are t6 be mnlade in a couutrvl
life; andl as my readling lhas vey nmuch lain along books of
natlural history, I cannot.orbear recollecting, upon this occan.sion, the several remalrks which I have mnet with in ai-.
tholrs, and comparing}' tl}em with what falls under l.my own
observation; the argufrnents for Providence drawn froiom the
natural history of animals, being, in my opinion, deimolni
strative.
2. The  akle of eve-ry klind of aniual is different froml
that of every otber kind; and there is not the least turn in
the muscles or twist ini the fibres of any pne, which does.
not render them mnore proper for that particular animal's
way of life, thanl any other cast or texture of themn would
liave been.
The most violent appetites in all creatures are lust and
h.ng'er; the first is a perpetual call upon them to propagate their kind,; the latter to preserve themselves.
3. It is astonishi;ng to consider the dil'rent degfrees of
care that- lescend fromn'the parent to the young, so far as is
absolutely necessary for the leaving a posterity. Some, creatures cast their eggs as chance directs them, and
tAillhnk of them no furthile, as insects, and several kinds ofth$':f}he to;; Gct&amp;.1; 1; curd,'s M,onitoi,

6. WVith whmat caution does the hen provide herself a
nest in places unfrequented, and free from- noise and disturhances? Vfbihen she has laid her eggs in such a alnner
that she cani cover them, what care does she take in turln
i-ng tliem i requeentiy, that all parts may parx tak, of, the
Vitjal warmth1? r \When she leaves ithem, to provide for her
necessary sustenance, how punctually does she return be*
fire they have time to cool, and become incapable of producing an animall I In the sulmmer, yu see her giving
hersel' greater frecledoms, and quitting her care for above
ltwo- lhours togetiher;  ut, in winter, whel1 te riour of
the season would chil1l the principles of life, and destroy
the young one, she cgrows ioore assidutous in her attend4
ance, and stays away but half the tirne.
7.'W,hen the birth approaches,'with how mnuch nicety
and attention does she help the chick to break its prison

ing it to help itself; nor to mention her forsaking the nest,
if after the usual time of reckoning the- young one does
not make its appearance. A chymical operation. could
lnot be fol68wed with greater art or diligence, than is seen
in the hatching of a chick; though there are many more
birds that show an infinitely greater sagacity in aill the
fore mentioned particulars.
8. But at the same time the lhen, that has all this secming ingenuity (which is indeed absolutely necessary for
the propagation of the species) considered in other respects, is without the least glimmllerings of thought or common sense. She mistakes a piece of chalk for an egg, and
sits upon it in the samne manner: she is insensible of any
increase or diminutioni in the number of those she lays:
she does not distinguish between her own and those of
another species; and whlen the birth appears of ever so
different a bird, will cherish it for her own. In all these
circumstances, which do not carry an immediate regard
to thle subsistence of herself of her species, she is a very
idiot.
9. There is not, in my opinion, any thing more myste-rious in nature than this instinct in animals, which thus.
irises above reason, and falls infinitely short of it. It cannot be accountedl for by any pfroperties of matter, and at
the same tiim-e works after so odd a mllanner, that one canniot think it the faculty of an intellectual being.  For my
own part, I look upon it as upon the principle of gravitation in bodies, which is not tt be explained by any,known
qualities inherent in the bodies themselves, nor from.any
laws in niechanism; but, according to the best notions of:the greatest philosophers, is an immediate impression
from the first mover, and the divine energy acting in the.creature.
Good-Breeding.
1. COMPLAISANCE renders a superior amiable, an
equal agreeable, and an inferior acceptable. It smoothes
distinction, sweetens conversation, and makes every one in
the company pleased with himself. It produces good nature and mutual benevolence, encourages the timorlous,
soothes thIe turbulent, humanizes the fierce, and distina188-  The Youzng Gentlemnan and Lady's Monitor,
guishes a society of civilized persons from a confusion of
savages. In a word, complaisance is a virtue that blends
all orders of men together in a friendly intercourse of
words and actions, and is suited to that equality in human
nature which evely one ought to consider, so far as is consistent with the order and economy of the world.
2. If we could look into the secret anguish and affliction
of every man's heart, we should often find, that more of it
arises from little imaginary distresses, siich as checks,
frowns, contradictions, expressions of contempt, and (what
Sliaklweare reckons among other evils under the sun)
i"-Thle poor man's contumely,
" The insolence of office, and the spurns
" That patient merit of the unworthy takes,"
than from the more real pains and calamities of life. The
only method to remove these imaginary distresses as much
as possible out of human life, would be the universal practice of such an ingenious complaisance as I have been
here describing, which, as it is a virtue, may be defined
to be a " constaint endeavour to please those whom we
" converse With, so far as we may do it innocently."
3. Good-breeding necessarily implies civility; but civility
does not reciprocally imply good-breeding. The former
has its intrinsic weight and value, which the latter always
adorns, and.often doubles by its workmanship.
To sacrifice one's own self-love to other people's, is a
short) but, I believe, a true definitioin of civility: to do. it
with ease, propriety and grace, is good-breeding. The
one is the result of good-nature; the other of good-sense,
joined to experience, observation and attention.
4. A ploughman will be civil, if he is good-natured, but
cannot be well bred. A courtier will be wvell bred though
perhaps without good-nature, if he has but good sense.
Flattery is the disgrace of good-breeding, as brutality often
is of truth and sincerity. Good-breeding is the middle
point between those two odious extremes.
Ceremony is the superstition of good-bre.eding, as well
as of religion: but yet, being an out-work to both, should
not be absolutely demolished. It is always, to a certain
degree, to be complied with,though despised by those who
think, because admired and respected by those who do
9.tpand Eng.lish Teacher's Assistant,    189
5. The most perfect degree of good-breeding, as I have
already hinted, is only to be acquired by great knowledge
of the world, and keeping the best company. It is not the
object of mere speculation, and cannot be exactly defined,
as it consists in a fitness, a propriety of 70'ords, actions,
and even looks, adapted to the infinite variety and coml
binations of persons, places, and things. It is a mode,
not a substance; for what is good-breeding at St. James's,
w\ould pass forl ioppery or banter in a remote village; and
the homnespun civility of that village wouldl be considered
as brutality at court.
6. A cloistered pedant may form true notions of civility; but if amnidst the cobwebs of his cell he pretencls to
spins a speculative system of good-breedin-g, he will not
be less absurdc than his predecessor, wlho judiciously undlertook to instruct Hannibal, in the art of war. The most
ridiculous and most aukward of men are, therefore, the
speculatively well bired moilks of all religions and all professions.
7. Good-breeding, like charity, not only covers a multitude of faults, but, to a certain degree, supplies the Nwant
of some virtues. In the common intercourse of life, it
acts good-nature, and often does what good-nature wvill
not alhvays do; it keeps both wits and fools within those
bounds of decency, which the former are too apt to transgress, and which the latter never know. Courts are unquestionably the seats of good-breeding, and must necessarily be so; otherwise they would be the seats of violence
and desolation. There all the passions are in their highest state of fermentation.
8. All pursue what but few can obtain, and many seek
what but one can enjoy. Good-breeding, alone restrains
their excesses. There, if enemies did not embrace they
would stab. There, smiles are often put on to conceal
tears. There, mutual services are professed, while mutual injuries are intended; and there, the guile of the serpent stimulates the gentleness of the dove: all this, it is
true, at the expense of sincerity; but upon the whole, to
the advantage of social intercourse in general.
9. I would not be misapprehended, and supposed -to recommend good-breeding, thus prophaned and prostituted
to the purposes of guilt and perfidy; but I thiak I mnay1'90  Tlhe Young Gentlenmizan'd Lady's Monitor,
justly infer'from it, to what a'degree the accomplishment
of good-breeding must adorn and enforce virtue and truth,
when it can thus soften the outrages and deformity of vice
and falsehood.; I am sorry to be obliged to confess, that
mly native country is not perhlaps the seat of the most peft
fect good-breeding, though I really believe, that it yielcls
to none'in hearty and sincere civility, as far as civility -is
(and to a certain degree it is) an-inferior moral duty of
doing as one would be done by.
10. If France exceeds us in that particular, the in d9nparable author of L'Esfiiit des Loix accounts for ifvery
impartially, and I believe very truly. " If my cointry" men," says he, " are the best bred people in the world,
"it'is only because they are the vainest." It is certain
that their good-breeding and attention, by flattering the
vanity and self-love'of others, repay their own with interest.' It is a general commerce, usefully carried on by a'barter o'f attentions, and often without one grain of solid
merit, by way of medium, to-make up the balance.
11. It were to be'wished that good-breeding were in
general thought a more essential part in the education of
our youth, especially of distinction,than at present it seems
to, be. It might even be substituted in the room of some
academicalst;udies, that take tp a great deal of time to very
little purpose; or, at.least, it might usefully share some of
those many hours, that are so frequently employed upon
a coach-box, or in stables. Surely those, who by their
rank and fortune are called to adorn ~court:, ought at least
not to disgrace them by their manners.
Ni-z;-'- 1 tt- &amp;  WIE of~,e rn;s concern, that it is thie f ishon foD
our youth of botlh sexes to brand good-breeding with the
name ot ceremony and formality. As such they ridicule
anld explode it, ancld adopt in its stead, an olfensive carelessness and inattention, to the diminution, I will venture to
say, even of their own pleasures, if they know what true
pleasures are. L.ove and friendship necessarily produce,
and justly authlorize familiarity; but'then good-breeding.
must mark out its bounds, and say, thus far shalt thou go,
and no farther; for I have known nlany a' passion and
mnany a friendship, degraded, weakened, and at last (if I
may use the expression) wholly flattened away. by an unguarded and illiberal famiiiarity.and English?7eacher's Assistant:    19 i
13. Nor is good-breeding less the ornament and cerment of common social life: it connects, it endears, and at
the same time that it indulges the justliberty, restrains that
indecent licentiousness of conversation, whiclhalienates and
provokes. Great talents make a mall famous, great merit makes him respected, and grieat learning makes hil
esteemed; but good breedi'ng alone can make him beloved.
14. 1 recommend it in a more particular manner to my
countrywomen, as the greatest ornament to such of them
as have beauty, and the safest refuge for those who have
not. It facilitates the victories, decorates the triumphs, and
secures the conquests of beauty; or in some degree atones.
for the want of it. It almost deifies a fine woman, and
procures respect at least to those who have not charms
enough to be admired. Upon the whole, though goodbreeding cannot, strictly speaking, be called a virtue, yet it
is productive of so many good effects, that, in my opinion,
it may be justlv reckoned more than a mere accomplishnient.                            WVORLD, No. 143.
Further Remnarks, taken from Lord Chester,feld's Letters to his Son.
1S. GOOD-BREEDING has been very justly defined
to be " the result of much good-sense, some good na-.
ture and a little self-denial for the sake of others, an(d
with a view to obtain the same indulgence from them."
Good-breeding alone can prepossess people in our favour at first sight; more time being necessary to discover
greater talents. Good-breeding, however, does not consist in low boxws, anid formal'ceremony; but in an easyi
civil, and respectful behaviour.
16. Indeed, good-sense, in many cases, must determine
good-breeding; for wlhat would be civil at one time, and
to one persoin, would be rude- at another time, and to another person: there are, however, some general riuldes of
good-breeding., As for' example; to answer only yes, or
no, to any person, without adding sir, my lordi, or madamn
(as it may happen) is always extiemely rtide; and it is
equally so not to give proper attentioon and a civil ansY'er,
when spoken to: such behaviour convinces the person who
is speaking to us, thlat we despise him, and do not think
hitn' worthly of otr attention or answer.
17; A well-bredl person xvill. take care to answer witha2192   The Young Gentlenan and Lady's Monitor)
complaisance when he is spoken to; w'ill place himself at
the lower end of the table', unless bid to go higher; will
first drink to the lady of the house;, and then to the 1master;
he will not eat aukwardly or dirtily, nor sit when others
stand; and he will do all this with an air of complaisance,
and not with a grave ill-natured look, as if he did it all
unwillingly.
18. There is nothing more difficult to attain, or so necessary to possess, as perfect good-breeding; which is
equally inconsistent with a stiff formality, an impertinent
forwardness, and an aukward bashfulness. A little ceremony is sometimes necessary; a certain degree of firmness is absolutely so; and an outward modesty is extremely becoming.
19. Virtue and learning, like gold, have their intrinsic
value; but, if they are not polished, they certainly lose a
great deal of their lustre: and even polished brass will
pass upon more people than, rough gold. What a number of sins does the cheerful, easy, good-breeding of the
French frequently cover!
My Lord Bacon says, that " a pleasing figure is a per"petual letter of recommendation." It is certainly an
agreeable fore-runner of merit and smoothsthe way for it.
20. A man of good-breeding should be acquainted with
the forms and particular customs of courts. At Vieenn
men always make courtesies, instead of bows, to the emperor; in France nobody bovws to the king, or kisses his
hand; but in Sliain and Eng'land bows are made and hands
are kissed.  Thus every court has some peculiarity,
which those'Who visit them ought previously to informa
themselves of, to avoid blunders and aukwardness.
21. Very few, scarce any, are wanting in the respect
wlhich they should shew to those-whom they acknowledge
to be infinitely their superiors. The man of fashion, and
of the world, expresses it in its fullest extent; but naturally, easily, and without concern:, whereas a man, who is
not used to keep good company, expresses it aukwardly;
one sees that he is not used to it, and that it costs him a
great deal: but I never saw the worst bred man living,
guilty of lolling, whistling, scratching his head, and suchlike indccencies, in company that he respected. In suchcompanies2 therefore, the only point to be attenced to is,and teg,ish seacher's Assistant.
to shew'that respect, which every body means to shew, in
anl easy, unembarrassed and graceful manner.
22. In mixed companies, whoever is admitted to make
part of them, is, for the time at least, supposed to be upon
a footing of equality with the rest; and consequently, every one claims, and very justly, every mark of civility and
good-breeding.  Ease is allowed, but carelessness and
negligence are strictly forbidden. If a man accosts you,
and talks to you ever so dully or frivolously, it is worse
than rudeness, it is brutality, to shewv him, by a manifest
inattention to what he says, that you think hlim a fool or a
blockhead, and not worth hearing.
23. It is much more so with regard to women; who, of
whatever rank they are, are eintitled, in consideration of
their sex, not only to an attentive, but an officious goodbreeding from men. Their little wants, likings, dislikes,
preferences, antipathies, fancies, whims, and even imper-.
tinences, must be officiously attended to, flattered, and, if'
possible, guessed at and anticipated, by a well-bred man..
You mtust never usurp to yourself those conveniences aiad
agre'nens which are of common right; such as the best places, the best dishes, &amp;c. but, on the contrary, always decline themself yourself, and offer them to others; who, intheir turns, will offer them to you: so that, upon the whole,.
you will, in your turn, enjoy your share of common right.
24. The third sort of good-breeding is local; and is variously modified, in not only different countries, but in different towns in the same country. But it must be founded.
upon the two former sorts: they are thre matter.,; to which,.
in this case, fashion and custom only give the differentshapesland impressions. Whoever has the two first sorts.
will easily acquire this third sort of g,o0od-breeding, whichdepends singly upon attention and observation. It is properly the polish, the lustre, the last finishing strokes of
good-breeding. A man of sense, therefore, carefully at--
tends to the local manners of the respective places where
he is, andc takes for his models those persons, whom he observes to be at the hbead!~it'ahe fashion and good-breedingo.
25. He watches how they address, themselves to their
superiors, how they accost their equals, and. how they treat
their inferiors: and lets none of those little niceties escape
hinm  whlich are to good-breedinC, what the last delicate
19314   h7ie Young tlentleman   and Lady%s Monitor,

5. At the same time modesty will fill up the wrinkles of
old age with glory; make sixty blush itself into sixteen;
and help a green sick girl to defeat the satyr of a false waggish lover, who might compare her colour, when'she
looked like a ghost, to the blowing of the rose-bud, by blushing herself into a bloom of beauty; and might make what
he meant a reflection, a real compliment, at any hour of
the da,in spite of his teeth. It has a prevailing power
with n2, whenever I find it in the sex.
6. I who have the common fault of old men, to be very
sour and humou: some, iwhen I drink my water-gruel in a
norning, fell into a more than ordinary pet with a maid
whom I call my nurse, fron a constant tenderness, that I
have observed her to exercise towards me beyond all my
other servants; I perceived lher flush and glow in the facet
in a manner which I could plainly discern proceeded not
from anger or resentment of my correction, but from a
good natured regret, upon a fear that she had offended lher
grave old master.
7. I was so heartily pleased, that I eased her of the honest trouble she underwent inwardly for my sake; and P'iving her half a crown, I told her it was a forfeit due to lher
because I was out of humour with her without aniy reason at all. And as she is so gentle-hearted, I hlave diligently avoided giving her one harsh word ever since: and
I find my own reward in it: for not being so testy as I
used, has mad- me much haler and stronger than I was
before.
8. The pretty, and witty, and virtuous Simnilicia, was,
the other day, visiting with an old aunt of her's, that I verily believe has read the./talantis i she took a story out
tlhere, and dressed up an old honest neighbour in the -second hand clothes of scandal. The young creature hid her
face with her fan at every burst and peal of laughter, and
blushed for her guilty parent; by which she atoned, methouglt, for every scandal that ran round the beautiful
circle.
9. As I was going home to bed that evening, I could
aot help thinking of her all the way I wunt. I re~r.sented194   The YoungS Gentlemnan and Lady's Monitor,
and masterly touches arle to a good picture, and which the
vulgar have no notion of, but by which good judges distinguish the master. He attends even to their airs, dress, and
motions, and imitates them liberally, and not servilely; he
copies, but does not mimic. These personal graces are.of
very great consequence. Tlhey anticipate the sentiments,
before merit can engage the understanding: they captivate
the heart, and give rise, I believe, to the extravagant notions of charms and philtres. Their effects were so surprising, that they were reckoned supernatural.
26. In short, as it is necessary topossess learning, honor
and virtue, to gain the esteem aind admiration of mankind,
so politeness ancd good-breeding are equally necessary to
render us agreeable in conversation and common life.
Great talents are above the generality of the world; who
neither possess them themselves, norare competent judges
of them in others; but all are judges of the:lesser talents,
such. as civility, affability, and an agreeable address and
manner; because'they feel the good effects of them, as
making society easy and agreeable.
To conclude: be assured that the profoundest learning,
without" good-breeding, is unwelconle and tiresome pedantry; that a man who is not perfectly well-bred, is unfit for company, and unwelcome in it; and that a man,
who is not well-bred, is full as. unfit for business as for
company.
Make, then, good-breeding the great object of your
thoughts and actions. Observe-carefully the behaviour
and manners, of those who are distinguis.hed by their goodbreeding; imitate,. nay, endeavour to excei, that you may
at least reach them; and be convinced that good-breeding
is to all worldly qualifications, what charity is to all christian virtues. Observe how it adorns merit, and ho-w of=
ten it covers the want of it,
Genteel Carriage..
1. NEXT to..oocld-breeding sisa genteel- nanner and
carriage, wholly free from those ill ha'bits and. aukward
actions, which many very worthy persons are addicted to6
2. A genteel manner of behaviourj how trifling soever
it may seem, is of the utmost conseqtlence in private life.azd English Teacher's Assistant.    l95
Men of very inferior-parts have been esteehied, merely
for their genteel carriage and good-breeding, while sensi':
ble men have given disgust for want of it.  There is
something or other that prepossesses us at first sight inl
favor of a well-bred man, and makes us wish to like him..,
3. iVhen an aukward fellow first comes into a room, he
attempts to bow, and his sword, if he wears one, gets be-:
tween his legs, and nearly throws him down. Confused
and ashamed, he stumbles to the upper end of the roon
and seats himself in the very chair he should not. He there,
begins playing with his hat, which he presently drops;.
an(l recovering his hat, he lets fall his cane; and in picking up his cane, down goes his hat again: thus'tis a considerable time before he is adjusted.
4. XVhen his tea or coffee is handed to him} he spreads.
his handkerchief upon his knee, scalds his mouth, drops
either the cup. or the saucer, and spills the tea or coffee
in his lap. At dinner he is more uncommonly aukward:
there he tucks his napkin through a button-hole, which
tickles his chin, and occasions him to make a variety of
wry faces; he seats himself on the edge of the chair, a,
so great a distance from the table, that he frequently drops
his meat between his plate and his mouth; he holds his
knife, fork and spoon different from other people; eats.
with his knife, to the manifest danger of his mouth; picks
his teeth with his fork, rakes his mouth with his finger,
and puts his spoon, which has been in his throat a dozen
times, into the dish again.
5. If he is to carve he cannot hit the joint, but in labouring to cut tlrough the bone, splashes the sauce over
every body's clothes. He generally daubs himself all over,.
his elbowvs are in the next person's plate, and he is up to
the knuckles in soup and grease. If he drinks, it is with
his mouth full, interrupting the whole company with, " to.
your good health, Sir," and " my service to you;" perhaps,coughs in his glass, and besprinkles the whole table.
Further, he has perhaps a number of disagreeable tricks;.
lie snuffs up his nose, picks it with his fingers, blows it,:
and looks in his handkerchief, craims his hands first in his
bosom, and next in his breeches.
6. In short, he neither dresses nor acts like any other
person; but is particularly aukward in every thing he does196   The Young Gentleman and Lady's lMonitor,
All this, I own, has nothing in it criminal; but it is such
an offence to good manners and good-breeding that it is
universally despised; it makes a man ridiculous in every
company, and, of course, ought carefully to be avoided
by every one who wouldwivislh to please.
7. From this pictulre of the ill-bred man, you will easily
discover that of the well-bred; for ou may readily judge
what you ought to do, when youl are told what you ought
not to do; a little attention to the manners of those who
have seen the world, will make a proper behayiour habitual and familiar to you.
8. Actions, that would otherwvise be pleasing, firequently
become ridiculous by your manner of doing them. If a
lady drops her fan in company, the worst bred man would
immediately pick it up, and give it to her; the best bred'man can do no. more; but then lie does it in a graceful
manner, which is sure to please; whereas the other would
do it so aukwardly as to be laughed at.
9. You may also know a well-bred person by his manner
of sitting. Ashamed and confused, the aukward man sits
in his chair stiff and bolt upright, whereas the man of
fashion is easy in every position; instead of lolling or
lounging as he sits, he leans with elegance, and by varying his attitudes, shews that he has been used to good company. Let it be one part of your study, then, to learn to
set genteely in different companies, to loll gracefully,where you are authorised to take that liberty, and to set:
up respectfully, where that freedom is not allowvable.
10. In short, you cannot conceive how advantageous a
graceful carriage and a pleasing address are, upon all occasions; they ensnare the affections, steal a prepossession
in our favour, and play about the heart till they engage it.
Now to acquire a graceful air, you ntust attend to your
dancing; no one can either sit, stand, or walk well iunless
he dances- well. And in learning to dance be particularly
attentive to the nlotion of your arms, for a stiffness in the
wrist will make any man look aukward. If a man walks
well, presents himself well in company, wears his hat well,
moves his head properly and his arms gracefully) it is
almost all that is necessary.
11. There is also an aukwardness in -speech, that naturally -falls under this head, and ought to, and may be guard,and JEnglish Teacher's Assistant.   ~97
ed against; such as forgetting names and mistaking one
name for another; to speak of Mr. VWhat-d'ye-call him, orl
You-know-who, Mrs. Thingum, What's-her-name, or,
I-ow-d'ye-call her, is exceedingly aukward and vulgar.'Tis the same to address people by improper titles, as sir
for my lord; to begin a story without being able to finish
it, and break off in the middle, with " I ha've forgot the
rest."
12. Our voice and manner of speaking, too, should
likewise be attended to. Some will mumble over their
words, so as not to be intelligible, and others will speak
so fast as not to be understood, and in doing this, will sputter and spit in your face; some will bawl as it they weire
speaking to the deaf: others will speak so low as scarcely
to be heard; and many will' put their faces so close to
your's as to offend you with their breath.
3. All these habits are horrid and disgustfiul, but may
easily be got the better of with care.'They are the vulgar
characteristics of a low-bred man, or are proofs that very
little pains have been bestowed in his education. In short,
an attention to these little matters is of greater importance than you are aware of; many a sensible man having
lost ground foi' want of these little graces, and many a
one possessed of these perfections alone, having made
his way through life, that otherwise would not h1a-ve been
noticed.
Cleanliness of Person.
14. BUT as no one can please in company, however
graceful his air, unless he be clean and neat in his person, this qualification comes next to be considered.
15. Negligence of one's person not only implies an unsufferable indolence, but an indifference whether we please
or not. In others, it betrays an insolence and affectation,
arising firom a presumption that they are sure of pleasing,
without having recourse to those means by which many
-are obliged to use.
16. He who is not thoroughly clean in his person, will
be offensive to all he converses with. A particular regard
to the cleanness of your mouth, teeth, hands and nails,
is but common decency.   A foul mouth and unclean
hands are certain marks of vulgarity; the first is thei 98  The Y2ung Gentlenman and Lady's Monitor,
cause of an offensive breath, which nobody can bear, and
the last is declaratory of dirty work; one may always
know a gentleman by the state of his hlinds and nails.
The flesh-at the roots should be kept back, so as to shew
the semicircles at the bottom of the nails; the edges of
the nails should never be cut down below the ends of the
fingers; nor should they be suffered to grow longer than
tie fingers.
17. Wvhen the niails are cut down to the quick, it is a
shrewd sign that the man is a mechanic, to whom long
nails wvould be troublesoine, or that he gets his bread by
fiddling; and if they are longer than his fingers ends,
and encircled with a black rim, it foretells he has been
laboriously and meanly employed, and too fatigued to
clean himself: a good apology for want of cleanliness in
a mechanic, but the greatest disgrace that can attend a
gentlemanl,
1i 8. These things n ay appear too significant to be mentionecl; but when it is considered that a thousand little
nameless things, vwhich every one feels but no one can describe, conspire to form that.iwhole of pleasing, I hope you
will, not call them trifling. Besides a cleani shirt and a
clean person are as necessary to health, as not to offend
other people. It is a maxim with me,.which I have lived
to see verified, that he who is negligent at twventy years of
age, will be a sloven at forty, and intolerable at fifty.
Dress.
19. NEATNESS of person I observed was as necessary as cleanliness; of course some attention must be
paid to your dress.
Such is the albsurdity of the times, that to pass well with
the world, we must adopt some of its customs, be they
ridiculous or not.
20. In the first place, to neglect one's dress is to affront
all the female part of our acquaintance.. The women in
particular pay an attention to their dress; to neglect,therefore, your's, will displease them, as it wvvould be tacitly
taxing them with vanity, and declaring that you thought
themi not worth the respect which every body else doeso
And, as I have mentioned before, as it is the women who
stamp a young man's credit in the fashionable world, if
you do not make -yourself agreeable to the women, you
will assuredly lose ground among the men,and L'n~giskh ITeacher's Assistant;  199
21. Dress, as trifling as it imay appear to a mnan of understanding, prepossesses on the first appearance, which
is friequently decisive; and indeed w\e may form some opinion of a man's sense'and character fiom his dress. Any
exceeding of the fashion, or any affectation in dress whatever, argues a weakness of understanding, and nine timres
out of ten it will be found so.
22.'There are few young fellows but what display somne
character or other in this shape. Some would be thought
fearless and brave: these wear a black cravat, a short coat
and waistcoat, an uncommon long sword hanging to their
knees, a large hat fiercely cocked, and are flash all overo
Others affect to be country squires; these will go about in
buckskin breeches, brown firocks, and g'reat oaken cudgels
in their hands, slouclhed hats, wvith their hair undressed
and tucked up behind thenm to an enormous size, and imitate grooms and country boobies so well externally, that
there is not the least doubt of tliheir resersbling them as
Yiell internally.
23. Others, again, paint and powder thenaselves so much,
and dress so finically, as leads us to suppose they are only
wonmen in boy's clothes. Nowv a sensible mani carefullyv
avoids all this, or any other affectation. He dresses as
fashionable and well as persons of the best families and
best sense; if he exceeds them, he is a coxcomb; if 1he
dr&amp;esses worse, he is unpardonable.
24. Dress yourself fine, then, if possible, or plain, agreeable to the company you are in; that i9, conform to the
dress of others, and avoid the: appearance of being tumbledo  Jmita: -. those reasonable people of your own age,
whose dress is neither remarked as too neglected cr too
mulch studied. Take care to have your clothes well made,
in the fasl-ion, and to fit you, or you will, after all, appear
auklward'. WVhen once dressed,think no more of it; si-hew
no fear. of discomposing your dress, but let all youir motions be as easy and unembarrassed, as if you was t hiome
in your dishabille.
~legrvance of Expres,siona.

$200   The You2ng Gentleman and- la[y's Monitor,

graceful speaking is as essentlal as grace-fulness of personm
Every man cannotbe an harmonious speaker; a roughness
or coarseness of voice nmay prevent it; but if there are no
matural imperfections, if a man does inot stainmer or lisp,
or has not lost his teeth, he may speak gracefully; nor
-will all these defects, if he has a mind to it, prevent him
fron speaking correctly,
26. ITNobody can attend with pleasure to a-'bad speaker.
One who tells his story ill, be it ever so impor-tant, w-ill tire
even the imost patient. If you have been present at the
performance of a good traredy, you have douibtless been
sensible of the good effects of a speech iell delivered;ci
how much it has interested and affected you; and on the
contrary, how mi.uch an ill-spoken one has disgusted you.
27.'Tis the same in common conversation; he who
speaks deliberately, distinctly and correctly; he who mnakes
use of tihe best words to express himself, and varies -Iis
voice according to the nature of the subject, will always
please, while the thick or -hasty speaker, he who -r-vmumbles
out a set of ill-chosen words, utters them ungramnmatically
or with a dull mnonotony, will tire and disgust. Be assured
then, the air, the gesture, the looks of a speaker, a proper
accent, a just emphasis, and tunefill cacence, are fulllas
necessary, to please and to he attended to, as the subject
matter itself.
28. People may talk -what they will of solid reasoning
and sound sense; without the graces and ornaments of
language, they will neither please nor persuade. In comn--
mron discoulrse, even trifles elegantly expressed, will be
better received, than the best of argumrnets homespun
and unadorned.
29. A good way to acquire a graceful uttterance, is to
read aloud to some friend every day, and beg of him to
set you right, in case you read too fast, do not obsers-e the
proper stops, lay wrong emphasis, or utter your words
indistinctly. You mnay even read aloud to yourself where
such a friend is not at hand, and you will find you/ own
ear a good colrrector. Take care to open your teeth when.you read or speak, and' articulate every word distinctly v
which last cannot' be done but by sounding the final letter.
But above all, endeavQour to vary.yourvoice according- toand English Teacher's Assistant.     201'

to this, it will in a little time become easy and habitual
to you.
3:0.:Ty an attention also to your looks and your gesture,
when talking even on the most trifling subjects: things appear very difeprent according as they are e-xpressed, looked
and delivered.
Now-, if it is necessary to attend so particularly to our
inaanner of speaking, it is much more so with regard to the
mzrtter. Fine turns of expression, a genteel and correct
style, are ornameants as requisite to common sense. as poaite behaviour and an elegant address are to common good
mnanners; thevy tre great assistants i'n the point of pleasing.
A gentlenan,'tis true, inay be known in the imeanest
garb, bhUt it admnits not of a doubt-, that he would be better
received into good company genteily and fashionably
dressed, than was he to appear in dirt ad tatters.
31. -Be careful, then, of vour style upon all occasions;
whether you write or speak, study for the best wo'rds and
best expressions, even in common conversation and the
most familiar letters. This will prevent y our speaking in
av hurry, than-which nothing is more vulgar; though you
rnrav be a little embarrassed at -first, time antld utse wirll
render it easy. It is no stlch dificult thing to express
ourseives well on subiects we are thoroughly acquainted
waith, if we 1hlink before we speak; and no one shouldl presumle to do other"wise.

befobe,' bet sure to cio it a. fterwalrds: consideir with yourself

ant if you are in doubt of the: propriety or elegancy of any
word, search for it in some dictionary, or some good author, hownl yoiu remember it; never be sparing of your
trouble;hile you w-ish to improve; and my word for it, a
very little trme wVill, nmake this matter habitual.
33. In order to speak gramimatically, and to express
yourself pleasinl~, I would recommend it to you to translate cften, any language you are acquainted wvith, into En1
glish, and to correct suich translation till the vwords, their
order, and the periods, are agreeable to your ownlIi ear.

proverbs and hackneyed sayings; instead of observing
that tastes are different, and tha-t most men have one pecAiliar to themseives, he will give you-"' WVhat is one man's

all occasions, riglht or wrong; such as va.,tly angry, vastly/
kind; devilis/z ugly, deuvilish handsomne; imrMensely great,
imm17ensely little.
35. Even his pronunciation carries the mark of vulgarity
along with it; he calls the earth yeart-h; finan'ces,fnz'ances;
he goes to wards, and not towards such a place. He affects to use hard words, to, give him the appearance of a
man of learning, but frecuently mristakes their meaniing,
and seldom, if ever, pironounces_them properly.
All this nmust be avoided, if you would not be supposed
to have -kept company witil foot-men and house-maids.
Neyer have recourse to proverbial or vulgar sayings; use
neither favourite -nor hard vwords, but seek for the most
elegant; be careful in the management of them, and depend on it your labour will not be lost; for nothing is more
engFaging than a fashionable and polite address.

Oboervation.
1. AS the art of pleasing is'to be learntonly by frequent.
ing the best companies, we must endeavour to pick it up
in such companies, by observation; for, it is not sense
and knowledge alone that will acquire esteem; these certainly are the first and necessary foundations for pleasing,
but they will by no.means do, unle6ss attended wvith mani
ners and attentioln.

her to inmyself as shedding holy blood every time she blushed, and as being a martyr in the cause of virtue. And
afterwards, when I was putting on my night-cap, I could
inot drive the thought out of my head, but that I was young
enough to be married to her; and that it would be an addition to the reputation I have in the study of wisdom, to
marry to so im-uch youth aid modesty, even in my old age.
10. I know there have not been wanting many wicked
objections agai'nst this virtue; one is grown insufferably
common. The fellow blushes, he is guilty. I should say
rather, He blushes, therefore he is innocent. I believe
thle same man, that first had that wicked imaginaRon of
a blush being the sig-n of guilt, represented good nature
to be folly; anld thlat he himself, was tlhe most inhumanl

opened to us. I would have all ladies who have a mind to
be thought well-bred, to think seriously on this virtue5
which he so beautifully calls the sanctity of manners.
12. M,odesty is a polite accompiishment, and generally
an attendant upoil merit. It is engaging to the highest degree, and wins the hearts of all our acquaintance. On the
contrary, none are more disgustful in comnany than the

2. There are a great maniy people likewise who busy
themselves the wvhole day, and who in fact do nothing.
They have possibly taken up a book for two or three hours,
but from a certain inattentiotn tl]at grows upon them the
more it is indulgedl, know no more of the contents than
if they had not looked into it; nay, it is impossible for
any one to retain' what- he reads, unless he' reflects and
reasons upon it as he goes on. Whlen they have thus
lounged away an hour or two, they will saunter into company, without attending' to any thing that passes there;
but, if they think at all, are thinking of some trifling
matter that ought not to occupy their attention; thence
perhaps they go to the play, where they stare at the company and the lights, without attending to the piece, the
very thing they went to see.
3. In this manner they wear. away their hours, that
might otherwise be employed to their improvement and
advantage- This silly suspension of thought they would

you are, let me recomnmend it to you to pay attention to

every thing; that is said, see every thing that is done, and

4. A sontinual inattention to matters that occur, is the

the company of people of fashion, observe carefully their
behaviour, their address, and their manner-; iimitate it as
far as in your power. Your attention, if possible, should
be so ready as to observe every person in the roomi at
once, their motions, their looks, and their tur~ns of ex.
pression, and that without staring or seeminig to be an
observer. This kind of observation may be acquired by
care and practice, and will be found of the utmost advantage to you, in the course of life.

1. HAVING mentioned absence of mind, let -me be
more particular concerning it.
"WVhat the world calls an absent man is generally either
a very affected one or a very weak one; but whether weak
or affected, he is,.in company, a very disagreeable man.
Lost in thought, or, possibly in no thought at all, he is a
stranger to every one present, and to every thing that
passes; he knows not his best friends, is deficient in
every act of good manners, unobservant of the actions of
the company, and insensible to his own.
2. His answers are quite the reverse of what they ought
to be; talk to himn of one thing, he replies, as of another.e
IHe forgets what he said last, leaves his hat in one roomT,
his cane in another,. and his sword in a third; nay, if it
was not for his buckles, he would even leave his shoes
behitul him. Neither his armns nor his legs seem to be
a part of his body, and his head is never in a right posi.
tion. He joins not in the general conversation, except
it be by fits and starts,'as if awaking fiom a drea: - I attribute this either to wveakness or affectation.
3. His shallow mind is possibly not able to attend to
more than one thing at a time, or he would be supposed
wrapt up in the investigation of some very important matter. Such men as Sir Isaac V'ewton or. Mr. Locke, might
occasionally have some excuse for absence of mind; it
might proceed from that intenseness of thought that was
necessary at all times for the scientific subjects they were
studying:; but, for a young man, and'a man of the world,
wvho has no such plea to make, absence of mind is a rude5ess to the companwy and deserves the sevyerest censure,-06   T,e Young Gerztlemann and La4dy's Monl.tor,

rience ant-d observation, is so necessary, that wit-hout it we
shall az-ct very absurdly, and firequently give offence whein
iwe do not mean ito All the lear;ing and. paarts in tie world
wvill not secure us from it. ~Without an acquaintance writh
life, a'-man may say'very good things, but timle themr so iil,
and address tlhem so improperly, that he had much better
be silent. Full of himself and his own business, and inattentive to the circumstances and situations of those he
conveorses with, he vents it without the least discretion,
says things that he ought not to say, confUies sorme
shocks others, and puts the whole'company in pain, lest
Tvihat he utters next should prove worse-than the lasto
The best direction I can give you in this matter, is,. ra
ther to fall in with the conversation of others,'than start a
subjec!: of your own: rather strive to put the-m mole in1
conceit with thenmselves,than to draw their attentionto you0
Mo A uoyic  in lif, he who ri.nows little of iww..nkinM2but what he collects from books, lays it down a~ a mnaxim,
that most men love flattery;'in order therefore.to please,
he will flatter: -but, how? Wirithout regard either to circurmstances or occasions. Instead of those delicate touches, those soft tints,.that serve to heighten the piece, he
hays on his colours with a heavy hand, and daubs where
he means to adorn: in other words, he will flatter so unseasonably, and, at the same time, so grossly, that while
he wishes to please he puts out of countenance and is sure
to offend. )On the contrary, a man of the world, one who
has made life his study, knows the power of flattery as
w,rell as he; but then he knows how to apply it; he watches the opportunity, and does it indirectly, by inference,
comparison and hint.
3. Maln is made up of such a variety of matter, that, to
search him thoroughly, requires time and attention; for,
though we are all made of the same materials, and have
all the sa'me passionls, yet, from a difference in their proportion and combination, we vary in:our dispositions;
what is agreeable to one is disagreeable to another, and
what one shall approve, another shall condemni.  Reason
is given us' to controul these passions, but seldom cloes
it. Application therefore to the reason of any man will
frequently prove ineffectual, unless we eideavour at tile
saime time to cgain his hearto,t4 V'herever then you are, search into the characters of
men; find out, if possible, their foible, their governing
passion, or their partictlar merit; take them on their weak
side, and you will genervally succeed: their prevailing
v/anity you may readily discover, by observing their fa-'vourite topic of conversation, for every one talks most of
whtat hie would 1be thought most'to excel in.

without a sudden burst of joy, a cheelrul eye, or anl expandect face, is at the mercy of'every knave: for either
they will designedly please or provoke you themselves, to
catch your ung-uarded looks; oi they will seize the oppor

do it. You may possibly tell me, th.t tdhis coolness mrru.t

down with ill fortune, from our being able to read his cards
in his face; so the ma-n f the- world, having to deal wijh.one of these babblingi countenances, will take care to profit
by the circumstance, let the consequence, to him with
whom he deals, be as injurious as it may.
15. In the course of life, we shall find it necessary very
often to put on a pleasin;g countenance when we are exce:edingly displeased; we mumt ircqenlitly setl femitnadly
when we are quite otherwise. I anxm ienslbie it is difficult
to accost a man wit;; srmiiles whom we kj o-w to b1 our enemy: but what is'o be done? On r:ceiilin, ain al:;'ront if you
caInot be justified in knocking thie ofiender down, you
muist not. notice the oilence; for in the eye of the world,
taking an afifront calmly is considered as cowardice.
16. If fools shsould at any' tiime attempt to be witty upon
you, the best way is not to know tlleir wit-:cisms are levelled at you, but to conceal any uneasiness it may give you:
but, should they be so plain that you cannot be thought ig'
norant of their meaning, I wotuld recommend, rather than
quarrel with the company, joining even in the laugh agaiinst
yourself: allow the jest to be a good one, and take it in
seeming good humour. Never attemupt to retaliate the
same way, as that would imply you were hurt.  Should
what is said wound your- honour or your moral character,
there is but one pyoper reply, which I hope you will never
be obliged to have recourse to.
17. liemembel there are but two alternatives for a geng
tleman; extremne politeness, or the swor'd If a man openly and designledly affronts you, call him onat; but if it does
not amount to an open insult, be outwardly civil; if this
does not malke him aslhamed of his behaviour, it will prejudlice every by-stander in your favour, and instead of being disgraced, you will come off with honour. Politeness
to those we do not respect, is no more a breach of faith
than your htumble serv'a?t at the bottom of a challelige;
they are universally understood to be things of course.
18.' Wrangling and quarreling are characteristics of a
weak mind:, leave that to the women, be you always above
it. Enter into no sharp contest, and pride yourself in
shewing, if possible, more civility to your antagonist than
to any other in the company; this will infidllibly bring over
All, the laugehter to your side, and the person you are conmand ngltsih Teacher's Assistante   21 1
tending with will be very likely to confess you have behaved very handsomely throughout the whole affair.
19. Experience will teaoh us that though all men consist
principally of the same materials, as I before took notice,
-yet from a difference in their proportion, no two men are
uniformly the same: we differ from one another, and we
often differ from ourselves, that Is, we sometimes dothings
utterly inconsistent with the general tenor of our characg
ters. The wisest man will occasionallv do a weak thing  
the most honest man, a wrong thing; the proudest man,
a mean thing; and the worst.of men will sometimes do
a good thingS
20. On this account, our study of mankind should not
be general; we should take a fiequent view of indivi..duals, and though we may upon the-whole form a judgment of the man from his prevailing passion or his gene..
ral character, yet it will be prudent not to determine, till
we have waited to see the'operation of his subordinate.
appetites and humours.
21. For example; a man's general character may,be
that of strictly honest; I would not. dispute it, because rI
would not be thought envious or malevolent; but I would
not rely upon this general character, so as to entrust him
with my fortune dr my life. Should this honest maan, as;is not common, be my rival in power, interest, or love,
he may possibly do things that in other circumstances he.
~would abhor; -and power, interest, and love, let me tell
you, will often put honesty to the severest trial, and fre-,quently overpower it. I would then ransack this -honest
man to the bottom,. if I wished to trust him, and as I
found him, would place my confidence accordingly.
22. One of the great compositions in our nature is vanity, to whlich, all men, more or less, give w-"';,  omen
have an intolerable share,of it. No flattery5o adulation
is too gross ifor them; those who flatter them most please
them best, and they are most. in love with him who pretends to be most in, love with them.;'and the least slight
or' contempt of them is never forgotten, It- is in some
measure the same with.men; they will sooner pardon
an injury -than an insult,:and are- more iuehrt by contempt
than by ill-usage. Though all men do not boast:of,supe
rior. talents, -though they pretendr not to the abilities of a
Tc1}2  T/le Yo'ung Gentleman and Lady's Monitor,
P.f2e- a  rewton, oar a Bollingbroke, every one pretends
to have commluon sense, and' to discharge his.office in life.with. common decency;; to arraign- therefore, in any.hape, his abilities or integrity in the department he
holds, is an -insult he will not readily forgive.
23. As I would not have you- trust too implicitly to a
man, because the world gives, him a good character; so I
must' particularly caution you a,gainst those who speak
well of::themselves..: In general, suspect those who boast
(of.or affect to have any one virtue above all others, for
they are comarmonly imp )stors. There are exceptions,
howeve\r,'to this rule, for we hear of prudes that have been
mnade chaste, bullies that have been brave, and saints that
have been religious.. Confide only where'your own obsetrvation shall d.irect -you; observre'not only whvat is said,
but how,:it is said, and, if you have pendtration; you may
find out the truth better -by your ey.es than your ears,;'in
short, never take'd character upon common report, but
enquire into it yourself; for commnon report, though it
is'right in general, may be wrong in particularls.
24. Beware of those who, on a slight acquaintance,
milake a tender of.their friendship, and seem to. place'a
confidence in you;'tis ten to one but they deceive and betray you: however, do not rudely reject them upon suchl
a supposition; you may be civil to therm, though -you. do,
not entrlust them. Silly men are apt to solicit your friendship, and unbosom themselves upon the first acquaintan-ce: such friendls cannot be worth hearingi their friendship being as slender as their understanding-; and if they
proffer their friendship with a design to make a property
of you, they are da.ngerous acquaintance indeed.
-25. -No.t but the little friendships of the weak may be of
some use to'",ou, if you do not return the compliment.; and
it may not blamiss to seem to accept those of designing
rnen, keepiiig them, as it were, in play, that they may not
be openly your enemies; for their enmi/ty i; the next dan,
gerous thing to their friendship..WVe may certainly hold
their vices in abhorrence, without beingmarked out as their
personal enemy. The.general rule.is to have a real reserve
with almost every -one, and a seeming'reserve with almost
no one; for it is very disgusting. to'seem: reserved, and.
very dangerous not to be so. Few observe the true meand in[zglsh 2 Teacher's Assistant.'  213
litum. Many are ridciculously misterioufs upon trifles, and
many indiscreetly communicative of all th'y know.
26.- There is a kind of short-lived friendship that takesplace among young men, from a connection:in their plea.
sures only; a friendship too often'attended with bad consequences. This-companion of. your pleasures, youngandc unexperienced, will pxobably, in the heat of convivial'.
mirth, vow. a perpetual friendship, and unfold himself to,
you without the least reserve; but new associations, change
of fortune, or change of place, -may soon- break this illtimed connecti;on, and an improper use'may be made of it.
27. Be one,- if you will, in young ncoimpanies, and bear
youri part like others in the social festivity of youth; nay,
trust them with your innocent frolics, but keep your seiutis miatters to yoturself; and if you nmusst at any time make
them known, let it be to some tried friend of great experionce; and that nothing may tempt him to become youre
rival, let that friend be in a different walk of life frilom
yourself.
VW/Tere I to hear a man making strong protestations, and
swearing to the truth of a thing, that is in itself probable,
and very likely to be, I shall doubt his veracity; for when
he takes such pains to make m~ believe it, it cannot be
with a goodl desi;gni
28. There is a certain easiness or false modesty in most
young people,that either makes them unwilling, or asharimed
to refuse any thiang that is asked of them. There is also arn
um.nguardedopenness aboutthem, that makes them thle ready
prey of the artful an1d designing. They are easily led away
by the feigned friendships of a knave or a fool, aid too
rashly place a confidence in tlhemm, that terminates in their
loss, and frequently in their ruin. Beware, therefore, as t
said before, of these proffered friendships; repay them witli
comlpliments, but not with confidence. - Never let your val2ity make you suppose that people -become your friends
upon a slight acquaintance: for good offices must be shewn
on both sides to create a friendship; it will not thrive, unless its love be murtual; and it requir.es time to ripen it.
29. There is still among young: people ahother kind of
friendctship merely nominal,-warm indeed for the time, but
fortunately of no long continuance.  This friendship takeits rise from their pursuing the same course of riot and de1     l Thze Young Gentlenman and Lady's AMonritP,

either puts onle of them  in his pocket, and dangles the
other by Ilis side: or perhaps twirls his hat on his fingers,
or perhaps fumbles with the buttorY. If spoken to he is in
a much worse situation; he answers with the utmost difficulty, and nearly stammers; whereas a gentleman who
is acquainted with life, enters a room  with gracefulness
and a meodest assurance; addresses eve.n:-,rsons he does
not know, in an easy and natural manner, and without the
least embarrassment.
15. rhis is the characteristic of ood-breeding, a very
necessary knowledge in our intercourse with men; for
one of inferior parts, with the behaviour- of a gentlelnan, is
frequlently better received than a man of sense, with the
address and manneis of a clown. Ignoraince and v ice are
the only things we need be ashamed of, steer clear of
these, and you may go into any company you wvill; not
that I would have a young ran throwv off all dreadl of appearing abroad; as a iear of osending, or being disesteemed, will make himi preserve a p-rop-3r decorum.
16. Some persons, from expeiencimnb the bad effects of
filse mnodesty, have run into the: olhr extreme, and acquired the character of impudent.'This is asreat a ~ault
as the other. Awell-bred man keeps himself within the
two, and steers the middle way. He is easy and firm in
every company; is modest, but not bashftll; steady, but not
imnpudent. -rIe copies t-e manners of the better people,
and conlotrms to their cust-oms with ease and attention.
17. Till we can present ourseqlves in all companies with
coolness and unconcerni, We can never preseit ourselves!well; nor will, man ever e supposed to liave kept good
company, or ever be acceptable in such company, if he cannot app,ear there easy and lunerambarrassed. A:modest assurance in every part of life, is the most advantageous
qualification w.e can possibly aclquire.
18. instead of becominin insolent, a man of sense,,under
a consciousness of merit, is more mlodest. HIe btleaves
himself indeeCd with firmness, but without the least presumption. The manl who is ignorantof his own merit is

ratlher call this a confederacy: against good morals and
-good manners, and think: it deserves the severest lash of
the law; but they have the impudence to call it friendshipo
However, it is often as suddenly dissolved as it is hastily
contracted; some accident disperses them, and they presently' forget each other, except it is to betray and laugh
at their own egregious folly.
In. short, the sum of the whole is, to make a wide difference-between companions and friend; for a very agreeable
companion has often proved a very dangerous friend.
Chzoice of Company.
1. THE next thing to the choice of friends is the choice
of your-company.
Endcavour as much as you can to keep good company,
and the company of your superiors: for you will be held in
estimation according to thle company you keep. By superi'
ors I do not mean so much with regard to birth, as merit
and the light in which they are considered by the world.
2. There are -two sorts of good company; the one con-,
sists of, persons of birth, rank) and fashion; the other of
those who are (distinguished by some peculiar merit, in any
liberal art or science; as men of letters, &amp;c. and a mixture of these is what I would have ulnderstood by good
company; for it is not what particular sets of people shall
call themselves, but what the people in general acknow-'edge to be so, and are the accredited good company of
the place,.
3. Now and then, persons without either birth, rank, or
character, will creep into good company, under the proteetion of some considerable personage; but, in general,
none are -admitted of mean degree, or infamous moral
character.
In this fashionable good company alone, can you learn
thle b-est manners and the best language, for, as there is
no.legal standard to form them by,'tis here they are es.
talb.ished.
It may possibly be quiestioned, whether a man has it al[and Engtish Teacher's Assistant0    215
ways in his power to get into good company: undoubtedlyD
b,y,deserving it, he has; provided he is in circumstanceswhich enable him to live and appear in the style of a gentieman. Knowledge, modesty, and good-breeding, will.
endear him'to all that see him; for without politeness, the:
scholar is no better than a pedant, the phlilosopher than a
cynic, the soldier than a brute, nor any man than a clown.
4. Though the comrapany of men of learning and genius
is highly to be valued, and occasionally coveted, I would
by no means have you always found in such company0
As they do not live in the world, they cannot have that
easy manner and address which I would wish you to ac.
quire. If you call bear a part in suclh company, it is certginly adviseable to be in it somet;imes, and you will be
the more esteemled in other company by being so  builet it not engross you, lest you be considered as one of the
literati, which, ltowever respe..able in name, is not ihe
way to rise:or sbine in the fashionable world.
5. zut:the comnpany, which, of all others, you should
carefully avoid, is that, which, in every sense of the word,
mnay be called low; low in birt'h, low in rank, losv in parts,
and lov in manners: that company, who, insignaificant and
eontemrptible in themselves, think it an honour to be seen
with you, and who will flatter your follies, nay, your very
vices, to keep you with them.
6. Though you may think such a caution unnecessary,
r do not; for naay a young gentlenall of sense and rank
has beenrled by his,vanity to keep such company, till he
has been degraded, villified and undone.
Thle vanity I mean, is that.of being the first of the company. This pr ide, though too.common,. is idle to the last
degree. Nothin'g,in the "wolld lets a man down so much.
For the sake of dictating, being applauded a ad.mired
by this low comnpany, he is disgraced and disqualified for
better. Depend upon it, in the estilmation of.mankind
you will sink or 1ise to,the level of the.company you keep.
7. Be it then, your ambition to get into the best company-; and, when -there, imitate their virtues, but not theiir
vices. You have no doubt, often heard of genteel and
fashionable vices.  These are whorin,g, drinking, and,ranming. It has happened that some mnen even with.thes 4
iceu, hia.e bcen admired and esteemed~ Understan.dthis216i  The Young Gentlemat; aiicd Lady's Monitur,
matter rightly; it- is not their vices for which they are
admired; but for some accomplishments they at the same
time possess; for their parts, their learning, or their goodbreeding. Be assured, were they free from their vices,
they would be miuch more esteemed. -In these mixed cha.
racters, the bad part is overlooked, for the sake of the good.
8. Should you be unfortunate enough to have any vices
of your own, add not to their number by adopting the
vices of others. Vices of adoption are of all others the
most unpardonable, for they have not inadvertency to
plead. If people had no vices but their own, few would
have so manry as they have.
Imitate, then, only the perfections you meet with; copy
the politeness, the address, the easy manners of well-bred
people; and remember, let them shine ever so bright, if
they have any vices, they are so many blemishes, which it
would be -as ridicutlous to imitate, as it would to make anl
artificial wart on one's face, because some very handsome
ma-n had the misfortune to have a natural one upon his.

I. LET us now descend to minuter matters, which, tho'
not solimportant as those we have, mentioned, are still far
from inconsiderable. Of these. laughter is one.
Frequent and loud laughter is a sure sign of aweak mind,
and no less characteristic of a low education. It is the
manner in which lowv-bred men express their silly joy,-at
silly things,,and they call it being merry.
2.1 do not recommend upon all occasions a solemni countenance.'A man may smile; but if he would be-thought
a gentleman and a man of sense, he would by no means
laugh. True wit lever yet made a man of fashion laugh;
he is above it. It may create a smile; but as loud laughter
shews that a man has not the com-mand of himself, every
one who would- wish to appear sensible., must abhor it.
A man's going to set down, on a supposition that he has
a chair behind hinl, and filling for want of one, occasions a
general laugh, when the best piece of wit would not do it;
-a sufficient proof how low and unbecoming laughter is.
3. Besides, could the immoderate laugher hear his own
noise, or see the face he makes, he would despise himselfcnd Etnglsit Tea chier's Assis-tant~  217
for his folly. Laughter being generally supposed to be
the effect of gaity, its absurdity is not properly attendedl to;
but a little reflection will easily restrain it, and when you
are told it is a- marlk of low-breeding, I persuade myself
you will endeavour to avoid it.
4. Some people have a silly trick of laughing whenever
they speak, so that they are always on the grin, and their
taces are eyer distorted. This and a thousand other tricks,
such as scratching their heads, twirling their hats, fumbling,ith their button, playing with their fingers, &amp;c. are acquired from a false modesty at their first cut-set in life.
Being shame-faced in company, they try a variety of ways
to keep themselves in countenance; thus, they fall into
those.aukward habits I have mentioned, which grow upon
them, and in time become habitual.
Nothing is more repugnant likewise to good-breeding
than horse-play of any sort, romping, throwing things at olne
another's heads, and so on. They may pass well enough:with the mob, but they lessen and degrade the gentleman,
Seundry little Accomplishments.
1, 1 HAVE had reason to observe before, that variout
little matters, apparently triflisg in themselves, conspire
to form the'whole of pleasing, as in a well-finished portrait,
a variety of colours combine to complete the piece. It
not being necessary to dwell much upon them, I shall con-tent myself with just mentioning them as they occur.
2.'To do the honours of a table gracefully, is one of the
aoutlines of a wcell-bred man; and to carve well, is an article, little as- it may seem, that is usefiul twice every day,
and the doing of which ill is not only troublesome to one's
self, but renders us disagreeable and ridiculous to otherso
We are always in pain for a man who, instead of cuttirg
tip a fowl genteelly, is hacking for half an hour across the:bone, greasing himself, and bespattering the company with
the sauce. Use, with a little attention, is all that is re-quisite to acquit yourself well in this particular.
3. To be well received, you must also pay some attention to your behaviour at table, where it is exceedingly
rude to scratch any part of your body, to spit, or blow your
aose, if you can-p'ossibly7.yCid it, to eat greedily, to lean'24,1 TThe Young,, GentlemUan and Lady's Monitor,
your elbows on the table, to pick your teeth before the
dishes are removed, or to leave the table before grace is
said.
4. Drinking ot healths is now growipg out of fashion,
and is very unpolite in good company. Custom once had
anmade it universal, but the improved manners of the age.now iender it vulgar. What call be more rude or ridic-u
ious, than to interrupt persons at their meals with man un-.necessary compliment? Abstain then fromn this silly custonm,- where you find it out of use; and use it only at those
~tables where it continues general.
5. A polite mannler of refusing to comply with the.sli-,citations of a company, is also very necessary to be learnt,
for a young nan who seerns to have, no will of Ihis own,
but does every thing that is asked of him, may be a veiry
good-natured fellow, but be isa avery silly,one' If you are
Iinvited to drink at any man's house, more than you think
is wholesomle, you may say, "'you wish you could, but
"' that so little makes you both dlrunk and sick, that, you; shall only be bad company by doing it: of course beg
"- to be excused."
A. If desiread to play at cards deeper t:han you would9
refuse it ludicrously; tell them,_ 4 If you were sure to lose,
" you might possibly sit down; but that as fortune may be' favoui'ahble, you'dread the thought of having too much
"' mon.ey,ever since you found what an incumbrance it was' to pcor Harlequin, and therefore you are resolved ney,er
i; to put your-self in -he way of winning more than such
" and such a sum a day."- This light way of declining
invitations to vice and folly, is more becoming a young
man, than philosophical or sententious refiisals, which
would only be laughed. at.
7. Now I amn on the subject of cards, I must not omLt
mentioningthe necessity,of playingthem well and genteelly, if you would b.e thought toharve kept good company. X
would.by no smeasrecommend pllaying at cards as a part
of your study, lest you.should grow mto fond of it, and the
consequences prove bad. It were better not to know a
dliamond from a club, than to become a gambler; but, as
custom  hasm introduced innocent card-playing at most
fr;iendly meeetinDs, it marks thegentleman to handle them
gentetely, and play them well; inda. aI hope9you will playand Entglish reaChefrs Assistants.  1 t
only for small sums, should you lose your money pray lose
it with temper: or win, receive your winnings without
either elation or greediness.
8. To write well and correct, and in a pleasing style is
another part of polite education. Every man who has the
use of his eyes and his right hand, can write whatever
hand he pleases. Nothing is so illiberal as a school-boy's
scrawl. I would not have you learn a stiff formal handwriting, like that of a school-master, but a genteel, legi.
ble, and liberal hand, and to be able to write quick. As
to the correctness and elegancy of your writing, attention
to grammar does- the one, and to the best authors, the
other. Epistolary correspondence should not be carried
on in a studied or affected style, but the Ianguage should
flow fron the pen, as naturally and as, easily as it would
from the mouth. In short, a letter should: be penned in
the same style as you would talk to youi friend, if he was
present.
9. If writing well shews the gentleman, much more so
does spelling well. It is so essentially necessary for a gentleman, or a man of letters, that one false. spelling may fix
a ridicule on him for the remainder of his life. Words in
books are generally well spelled, according tc the orthography of the age; reading, therefore, with attention, will
teach every one to spell right. It. sometimes happens,
that words shall be spelled differently by different authors;
but, if you spell them upon the authority of one in estimation of the public, you will escape ridicule. Where there
is but one way of spelling a word, by your spelling- it
wrong, you willIbe sure to he laug~hed at. For a woman of
a tolerable education would laugh at and despise her lover,
if he wrote to her, and the words were ill-spelledo Be
lparticularly attentive, then, to your spelling.
10. There is nothing that a man at hi.s first appearance
in lire ought more to dread than having any ridicule fixed
on him. In the estimation even of the most rational
men, it will not only lessen him, but ruin him with all tihe
rest. NIany a man has been undonle by a ridiculous nickname. The causes of nick-names among well-bred men,
are~ generally the little defects in manner, air, or address~
To have the appellation of ill-bred, auki{ard, muttering,
left-leggec, or any other tacked always to your name,4220  The Young Gentleman and Laady's Noni tor,
would injure you more than you are aware of; avoid thenl
these little defects (and they are easily avoided) and you
need never fear a nick-name.
11. Some young men are apt to think, that they cannot
be complete gentlemen, without becoming men of pleasure. A rake is made up of.the meanest and most disgraceful vices. They all combine to degrade his character'
and ruin his -healthl and fortune. -A man of pleasure will
refine upon the enjoyments of the age, -attend tIleam with
decency, -and partake of them becomingly.
12. Indeed;he is too often less scrupulous than he should
be, and freq-uently has cause to repent it.. A nman of pleasure, at best, is but.a dissipated being,';nd -hat the rational
part of mankind most abhor: I mention it, howxever, lest,
in taking up' the man of pleasure, you should fall i-nto the
rake; for, of two evils, always chuse the least. A dissolute fla,gitious footman may make as good -a rake as a man'
of the first quality. Few men can be men of pleasure;
every man may be a rake.
13. There is a certain dignity that should be preserved
in all our pleasures,; in love, a man may lose his heart,
-without losing his nose; at table a man may have a -distinguished palate, without being a glutton; he may love wine
without being a drunkards he may' game without being
a gambler, anld so on.
14. Every virtue has its kindred vice, and every pleasure its neighbouring disgrace. Temperance and moderation mark the gentleman, but excess the blackguard. Attend carefully, then, to the line that divides theim; anrd remember, stop rather a vytiid short, than step an inch beyond it. Weigh the present enjoyme nt-of y our pleasures
against the necessary consequences of them, and I will
leave you to your own ldetermination.
15. A gentleman has ever some regard also to the choice
of his, amusements. If at cards, he'will tnot be seen at
cribbage, all-fours, or putt; or, in sports of exercise, at
skittles, foot-baIl, leap-frog, cricket, driving of coaches,
&amp;c. but will preserve a propriety in every part of his conduct; knowiDg, that any imitation of the manners of the
mob, will unavoidably stamp him wiYth vulgarity.'There
is another amusement too, which I canlnot help calling illiberal, that is, playing tipon any musical instrument,and. English Teacher's Assistant.  22 l
I 6-: MuLsiC- is commonly reckoned dne of the liberal arts'
and undoubtedly is so; but to be piping or fiddling at a
concert, Ss degrading to a. man of fashion. If you love
music, hear it; pay fiddlers to play to6 you, but never fiddle
yolurself. It makes a gentleman appear frivolous and
contemptible, leads him frequently into bad company, and
wastes that time whichz might.otherwise be well employed.
17. Secrecy is another characteristic of good-breeding.
Be careful not to tell in one company, what you see or
hear in another; much less to divert the present company at the expense-of the last. Things apparently indifferent may, when often repeated and told abroad, have
much more serious consequences than imagined. In
conversation'there is generally a tacit reliance, that what
is said will not be repeated; and a man, though not enjoined to secrecy, will be excluded company, if found to
be a tattler; besides, he will draw himself into a thousand
scrapes, and every one will be afraid to speak before him.
18. Pullin.g out your watch in company unasked, either
at home or abroad, is a mark of ill-breeding; if at home,
it appears as if you were tired of your company, and wished them to be gone; if abroad, as if the hours drag. heavily, and you wished to be gone yourself. If you want to
know the time, withclraw; besides, as the taking whlt is
called a French leave wvas introduced, that on one person's
leaving the company the rest might not be disturbed, looking at your watch does what that piece of politeness was
designed to prevent: it is a klind of dictating to all present,
and telling them it is time, gr almost time, to break up.
19. Amrong other things, let me cautiobl you against ever
being in a hurry; a iman of sense may be in haste, but he
is never in a hurry; convinced, that hurry: is the surest
way.to make him do what he undertakes ill. To be in a
hrrly, is a proof that thie business we. embark in is too
great for us; of course, it is -the mark of little minds, that
a6re puzzled and. perplexe(d when they should be cool and
rdeliberate; they wish to do every thing at once, and are
thus able to do nothing. Be steady, then, in all your en-,
gagenments; look round you before you begin; and re-.
rnember, that ybu had better do half of, them.well, and
leave the rest undone,,than to do the whole indifferently.
2o. J'rom a kind of false modesty, nmost young men222    The Young.Ontleaan and Laiy's'Monitor,
are apt to consider familiarity as unbecoming. Forwardcl
ness I allow is so; but there is a decent familiarity that is
necessary in the course of life. Mere formal visits, upon
formal invitations, are not the thing;'they create no connection, nor will they prove of service to you; it is the
careless and easy ingress and egress, at all hours, that
secures an acquaintance to our interest, and this is acquir.
ed by a respectful familiarity entered into, without forfeiting your consequence.
21. In acquiring new acquaintance, be careful not to
neglect your old, for a-slight of this kind is seldom forgiven. If you cannot be with your former acquaintance
so often as you used to be, while you had no others, take
cte not to give them cause to think you neglect them;
call upon them frequently though you cannot stay long
with them; tell them you are -sorry to leave them so soon,
and nothing should take you away but certain engagements which good manners obliged you to attend to; for
it will be your interest to make all the friends you can,
and as few enemies as possible.
22. By friends, I would not be understood to mean con.
fidential ones; but persons who speak of you respectfully, and who, consistent with their own interest, would
wish'-to be of service to you, and would rather do you
good than harm.
Another thing I must recommend to you, as characteristic of a polite education, and.of having kept good company, is a graceful manner of conferring favours. The most
obliging things may be done so aukwardly as to offendl
while the most disagreeable'things may be done so agreeable as to please.
23. A few more articles of general. advice, and I have
done; the first is on the subject of vanity. It is the cornmmon failing of youth, and as such ought to be carefully
guarded against. The vanity I mean, is that which, if
given way.to, stamps a man a coxcomb, a character he
will find a difficulty to get rid of, perhaps as. long as he
lives. Now this vatt:y shews itself in a variety of shapes;
ie man shall pride himself in taking the lead in all cont,,rsations, and peremptorily deciding upon every subject;
another, desirous of appearing successful among the wo.
mneny shall insinUate the encouragement he ha* met yith,and Englbs)z Teacher's Assistant.
the conquests he makes, and perhaps boasts of favours he
never received; if he speaks the truth, lhe is ungenerous;
if false, he is a villain; but whether true or false, he defeats his own purposes, overthrows the reputation he
wishes to eret,'and draws upon himself contempt in the
room of irespect.
24. Sonle men are vain enough to think they acquire
consequence by alliance, or by an acquaintance with persons of distinguislled character or abilities: hence they are
eternally talkkiig of their grand-father, Lord sutch-a-one;
theii kinsman, Sir William such-a-one; or their intimate
firienci, Dr. such-a.one, with whom, pe rhaps, they are scarce
acquailted. If they are ever found ont (and that they are
sure to be one time or other) tlhey become ridiculous and
contemptible; but even admitting what they say to be
true, what then? A man's Intrinsic.merit does not arise
from an ennobled alliance, or a reputable acquaintance,
25. A rich- man never borrows.  WVhen angling-foD
praise, modesty is the surest bait. If we wvould wish to
shine in any particular character, we must never affect
that character. An affectation of courage will-make a
man ptass for a bully; anil afectation of wit, for a coxcomb;
and an affectation of sense, for a fool. Not that i would
recommened bashfulness or.timidity; no-: I would have
every one klinow his own value, yet: not discover that.he
knows it, but leave his merit to be found out by others.
26. Anotier thing w.orth your attention is, if in company with an inferior, not to let him feel his inferiority; if
he discovers if himself without your endeavours, the fault
is not yours, andhe:will not blare: you; but if you take
pains to mortify him, or to'make him feel himself inferior
to you in abilities, fortune, or rankl it is an insult thatwill
not readlily be forgivene In point of. abilities, it would be
unjust, as they are out.of his powelr;.in point of rank or
fortune, it is ill-natured and illblred.
27 Thlis rule is never more necessary than atrtable,
where there cannot be a greater insult than to help al in-ferior -to a part he: dislikes, or a part that may be wret
than ordina ry, and to-t;akethe best to yourself. If you at
any time invite an inferior to your table, you put him dur-.
inog the time lle is:thereupon an equality:witll you, andit
is an act of the,highe~st rudeness.to treat him in any respect
u
223and English Teacher's Assistant.    11
never boasts ef them; whereas the timid and bashful can
never push himself in life, be his merit as great as it w-ill;
he will be always kept behind by the forward and the
bustling.
19. A man of abilities. and acquainted with life, will
stand as firm in defence of his own rights, and pursue his
plans as steadily anti unmoved as the most impudent iman
alive; but then he dloes it with a seemnllg mrodesty.
Thus, maniler is every thing; what is impudence in one
is proper assurance only in another: for firmness is cornmendable, but an.overbea:i'ig conduct is disgustful.
20. Forwardness being the very reverse of modesty,
follow rather than lead the compaiqy; that is, join in discourse upon their subjects rather than start cne of your
own; if you have parts, you will have opportunities enough
of shewing them on every to-jic of conversation; and if
you have none, it is better to expose yourself upon a subject of other people's, than on one of your own.
2 1. But be particularly careful not to speak of yourself
if you,can help it.'Anl impudent fellow lugs in himself
abruptly upon all -01i~`sions, and is ever the here of his
own story. Others ill' colour their arrogance withi, " It
may seem strange indeed, that I should talk in this manner of myself; it is -4fat I by no means like, and should
never do, if I had not'been crluelly and unjustly accused;
but when my character is attacked, it is a justice I ovwe
to myself to defend it."  This veil is too thin not to be
seen through on the first inspection.
22. Others again, with more art, will modestly boast of
all the principal virtues, by calling these virtues weaknesses, and sayg,&amp; they are so unfortunate as to fall into
those weaklesees. O I cannot see persons suffer," says
one of his cat,." without relieving them; though my circuswtaiices are very unable to atfbrd it-I cannot avoid
siaking truth; thouglh it is often iVery imprudent;" and
so on.
23. -This angling for praise is so preivailing a principle,
that i frequently stoops to the lowest object. Men will
ofte:east of doing that, which, if true, would be rather a
disgrate to them than otherwise. One man affirms that
ih J    wrenty miles within the hour:'fis probably a lie;
Wbt-'icsce he did, What tlen?.  He  ada good horse2'2 4  The Younl Gentmleman and Lad y's Monfitor,
slightingly. I would rather double my attention to such
a person, and treat him with additional liespect, lest he
shtulld even suppose himself neglected.
28. There cannot be a greater savageness or cruelty, or
any thing more degrading to aman of fashion, than to put
upon, or take unbecoming liberties with him, whose modesty, humility, or r;espect, will not suffer him to retaliate.
True politeness consists in making every body happy about
You;;and as to mortify is to render unhappy, it can be
nothing but the worst of breeding. Make it a:rule, rather
to flatter a person's vanity than otherwise; make him, if
possible, more in love with himself, and you will be certain to gain his esteem; never tell him any thing he may
not like to hear, nor say things that will put hil out of.countenance, but let it be your study on all occasions to
l1case: this will be'making firiends instead of enemies,.and-be a means of serving youlrself in the end.
29. Never be witty at the expense of any one present,
to gratify that idle inclination which is -too strong in most
young men, I mean, laughing at, or ridiculing the weakl
nesses or -infirmities of others, by way of diverting the
company, or displaying your own superiority. Most people have their weaknesses, their peculiar likings and aversions. Some cannot bear the sight of a cat; others the
smell of cheese, and so on; was you-to laugh at those
men for their antipathies, or by design or inattention to
bring them in their way, you could not insult them more.
30. You may possibly thus gain the laugh on your side
for the present,, but it will make the person, perhaps,' at
whose expense you are mferry, your enemy for ever after;
and even those who laugh with you, will, on a little reflection, fear you, and probably despise you: whereas to pro,
cure what one likes, and to remove what the other hates,
wvould shew thel that they were objects of your attention,
and possibly make them more your friends than mucl4
greater services would have done.
31. If you have wit, use it to please, but not to hurt.
You may shine, but take care not to scorch. In short,
zaever seem to see the faults of others. Though among
the mass of men there are, doubtless, numbers of fools
and knaves, yet were we to tell every one of these we meet
witht that we kwei them top be so, we should be in perpciand EnglishA Teacheier' Assistants  225
tuali war. I would detest the knave and pity the fool,
wherever I found him, bit I would let neither of them
Unow unnecessarily that I did so; as I -would not be industrious to make myself enemies. As one must please
others then, in order to be pleased one's self, consider what
is agreeable to you must be agreeable to them, and conduct yourself accordiilgly.
32. -Whispering in company is- another act of ill-breeding  it seems to insinuate either that the- persons wvhoim
we would not wish should hear, are unworthy of our confidence, or it may lead them to stuppose we are speaking
improperly of them; on bothl accounts, therefore, abstain
from it.
So pulling out one letter after' another, and reading them
in company, or cutting or pairing one's nails, is unpolite
and rude. It seems to say, we are weary of the conversation, and are in want of soime amusement to pass away
the time.
33. -Humming a tune to ourselves, drumming with our
fingers on the table, making a noise with our feet, and such
like, are all breaches of good manners, and indications of
ourcontempt for the persons present; therefore they should
not be indulged.
Walking fast in the streets is a mark of vulgarity, implyinghhurry of business; it may appear well in a mechanic
or tradesman, but suits ill with the character of a gentleman or a man or a man of fashion
Staring any. person you meet, fullin the face, is an act
also of ill-breeding; it looks as if you saw something
wonderful. in his appearance, and is, therefore, a tacit
reprtihension.
34. Eating quick, or very slow, at meals, is characteristic of the vulgar; the first infers poverty, that you have
not had a good meal for. some time; the last, if abroad,
that you dislike your entertainment; if at home, that you
are rude enough to set before your firiends, what you caniot eat yourself. So again, eating your soups with your
nose in the plate, is-vulgar; it has the appearance of being used to hard work, and of course an unsteady hand*~2.6.lhe Youzrg  e,nticnrtn antd Lady's Monitor;,

1. A'CERTAIN dignity of manners-is absolutely nlc
cessary, to make even the most. valluable character either
respected or Iespectable in the world.

the least related to'wit.

-most illiberal of all buffoonery; it is an insult on the person yoti mimic; and insults, I -have often told you, are
seldom forgiven.
As'to a mimic or a wag, he is little else than a buffoon,
who will distort his mouth and his eyes to make people
laugh.- Be assIued, no one perison ever demeaned himnself

" let's send for such a one,:for he is a good bottle comrpanion;" these are dPegradling distinctions, that preclude
all respect and esteem. Whoever is hled (as the phrase is)
for the sake of any qualification, singly, is merely that
tlhing he is /ad for, is never considered ini any othel light,
and, of course, never properly respected, let his intrinsic
merits be wyhat they will.
4. You -may possibly suppose this dignity of manners
to border upon pride; but it differs -as much from pride,
as true courage from bluStering.and- English Teacher's Assistant.    22.?
To flatter a person right or wrong, is abject flattery, and
to consent readily to every thing proposed by a company.,
be it silly or criminal, is full as degrading, as to dispute
warmly uponl every subiect, and to contradict, upon all oce
casions. To preierve dignity, we should modestly assert
our own sentiments, though we politely acq uiesce in those
of otlers.
So again, to support dignity of character, we should
neither be frivolously curious ahout trifles, nor be laboriously intent on little objects that deserve not a moment's
attention; for this implies -an incapacity in matters of
gre:ater importance.
A great deal likewise depends upon our air, acidress,
and expressions; an aukward address and vulgar expres.
sions, infer either a low turn of mind, or a lo,w educatilon,
5, Insole-nt contempt, or io.w envy, is incompatible also
with dignity of manners. Low-bred persons, fortunatel.y]
lifted in the wolrld,- in fine clothes and fine equipages,, will
insolently look down on all those who cannot affolrd to maIke
as good an appearance; and they openly envy those w}o
perhaps make a better. They Alsa dread the being slight-.
ed; of caurse are suspicious and captious; are, uneasy_.
themselves, and make every body else so about them.
6. A certain degree of outward seriousness in looks and
actions, gives dignity, while a constant smirk upon the
face (with that insipid silly smile fools have when they
would be civil) and whiffling motions, are- strong marks
of futility.But above all, a-dignity of character is to he acquired

timid, and passive complaisance, lets a man down more
than he is aware of: but still his firmness or resolutionl
Mhould not extend to brutality, but be accompanied with
a peculiar and engaging softness, or mildnes.s.
7. If you discover any hastiness in your temper, and
find it apt to break out into rough and unguarded expressions, watch it narrowly, and endeavour to curb it; but let
no complaisance, no weak desire of pleasing, no weedling,
urge you to do that which discretion forbids; but persist:and persevere in all that is right. In your connections

an affected dignity of manners, will even keep such a man

Rzdes for 4C nversation.
1. JACK LIZARD was about fifteen when he was first
entered in: the university, and being a youth of a great
deal of fire, and a more than ordinary application to his
studies, it gave' is Qonyersation a Verypr pti:ular turn. He,.atSd inSglih Teaches - Assistant.  229
had too mulch spirit to hold his tongue in company; but
at the same time so little acquaintance with the worlds
that he did not know ltow to talk like other people.
2. After a year and a half's stay at the university, he
canme do'wn among us to pass aNway a tonth or two in the
country. The first night after-his arrival, as we were it
supper, we were all of us very miucll improved by Jack's
table-talk. He, told us, upon the appearance of a dish of
wild-fowl, that according to the opinion of some natural
philosophers, they might be' lately come frbom the noon.
3. Upon which the Sparkler bursting out into a laulgh,
he insulted her with several questions, relating to the bigness, and distance of the moon and stars; and after every
interrogatory would be winking upon me, and smiling at
his sister's ignorance.,Jack gained':hispoint; for the mrother was pleased, and alltlhe servants stared at the learning
of their young master. Jack wNas so encouraged at this
success, that for the first week he- dealt wholly in paradoxes. It was a commaon jest with; him to pinch one of
his sister's lap-dogs, and afterwarcts prove he could tot
feel it.
4. When the girls were sorting' a set of knots, he wduld
dem.onstrate to them that all the ribbons wer'e of the same
colour; or rather, says Jack, of no colour at all. My Lady.j izxrd herself, though she Was.not a little pleased;,ith her
son's improvements, wnm one day almost angry with him;
-or, having accidentally burnt her fiugers as she was lighting her lamp for her tea-pot, iT the midst of her anguish,
Jack laid hold of the opportunity to instruct her that
there was no such thing as heat in fire. In short, no
day passed over our heads, in which Jack did not imiagine
he made the whole family wi"ser thanthey were before.
5. That part of his conversation-which gave me the most
pain, was what passed among those country gentlemen
that came to visit us. On such occasions Jack usually took
upon him to be the mouthof the company; and thining
himselfobliged to be very nerry, would entertain us with
a great many odd sayings and absugrdties of their college
cook. - I found this fellow had m ade a very strong inri
pression upon Jack's imagination, which he never cons]x
dered was not the case of the rest of the company, till
after many repeated trials he found-thatl hi stories setlom

6. I all this wvhile looked upon Jack as a young tree.shooting out into blossoms before its time; the redundancy
of which, though it was a little unseasonably, seemed to
foretell an uncommon fruitfulness.
In order to Nwear out the vein of pedantry, which ran
through his conversation, I took bim'out: with me one
evening, and first of all insinuated to himn this rule, which
I had myself learned from a very great author,''FTo thiink
with the wise, but talk with the vulgar." Jack's good
sense soon made him reflect that he lad exposed himself
to the laughter of the ignorant by a contrary behaviour;
iupon which he told me;j that he would take'care for tho
futture to keep his ilotions to hlimself, and converse in the
commolln received sentiments of mankind.
7. He at the same time desired, me to give him any
other rules of convers'ation, which I thought might be for
his improvement. I told him I would think of it; and accordingly, as I have a particular affection for the young
man- I gave him the next morning the following rules ii
writing, which may, perhaps, have contributed to make
hinm the agreeable man he now is.
8. The faculty of interchanging our thoughts with one
another, or wvhat we express by the word conversation,
has always been represented by moral writers, as one of
the noblest privileges of reason, and which more particularly sets mankind above the brute part of the creation,
Though nothing so much gains upon the affections as
this- extempore eloquence, which We have constantly occasion for, and are obliged to practice every day, we very
rarely meet with any who excel in it.
9. The conver4ation of most men is disagreeable, not
so much for want of wkt and learning, as of good-breeding
and discretion.
It is not in every man's power, perhaps, to have fine
parts, say witty things, or tell a story agreeably;- but every
man may be polite if he pleases, at least to a certain degree.
Politeness has infinitely more power to make us esteemed, and our company sought after, than the most extraordinary parts or attainments we can be master of. These
seldom fail to create envy,.and envy has always some ill
will in it.
10o If-yo uresolve to please never speak to gratify anyand;Eglish Teacher's Assistant.    231
particular vanity or passion of your own, but always with
a design either to divert or inform the company. A man
who only aims a.t one of -these, is always easy in his discourse. He is never out of humour at being interrupted,
because he considers that those w-ho hear him are the best
judges whether what he was saying would either divert
or inform hinm.
A modest person seldom fails to gain the good will of
those he converses with, lbecause nobody envies a man
who does not appear to be pleased with himself.
1 1. We should talk extremely little of ourselves. -indeed wrhat can we say? It would hbe as imprudent to discoverfaults, as ridiculous to count over our fancied virtues.
Our private anudcdomestic affairs a.re no less inmproper to
be introduced in conversation. Whlat-does it concern the
company lhow many horses you keep in your stables? or
whether your servant is most. knsave or fool?
12. A man may equalfly affront the company he is in, by
engrossing all the talk, or observing a contemptuous silence.
Conform yourself to the taste, character, and present
humours of the'persons yu converse with;'.not but a person mnust follow hlvis talent in conversation. l)o not force
-nature; no one ever did it with suLccess.
If you have not a talent' for humoour, or raillery, or
story-telling, never attempt them.
13. -Contain yourself also within the bounds of what you
know;'and never talkof things you are ignorant of, unless
it be with.a view to inform yours,elf. A. person cannotfaitl
in the observance of this r.ule, without making himself iiTdiculous-; a.nd yet how often do we see it transgressed I
Some, who on war or politics could talki very well' will be
perpetually haranguittng on works of genius and the belles
letters; othelrs who are capable of reasonino%g, and would
nmake a fig ur e in grave discouise, xwillyetconlstantly aim at
humour and pleasantry, though with the wors't grace ima,
ginable.  Hence it is, that.we see- a man of merit sometimes- appear like acoxcomb, and hear a man of genius
talk like a fool.
14. Before you tell a-story, it may be gener,lly not amiss
to dra-aa short character, anrd give the company a true idea
oftheprincip-al persons concerned in it; the bea'uty of Iostthings consitinlg not;so -uch- in their'bei.ng said er donr e232   Tze Young Gentleman and Ltady's JMonltot,
as in their being said or doie by such a particular person;
or on such a particular occasion.
15. Notwithstanding all the advantages of youth, few
young people please in conversation: the reason is, that
want of experience makes them positive, and whlat they
say, is rather with a design to please themselves, t-han any
one else.
It is certain that age itself shall lmake mnany thi'ngs pass
well enough, which would have been laughed at in the
nouth of one much younger.
16. Nothing, however, is more insupportable to men
of sense, thani an empty formal man who speakis in pro'
verbs, and decides all controversies with a short sentenice.
This piece of stupidity is the more insufib:alel, as it puts
on the air of wisdom.
Great talents for conversation requires to be accompanied with great politeness, HIe who eclipses others, owes
them great civilities and whatever a mnistaketn vanity
may tell us, it is better to please in conversation, than to
shine in it.
17. A prudent man will avoid talking much of any parlw
ticular science, for which he is remarkably famous,''here
is not, rmethinks, an handsomer thing said of Mr. Cowley
in his whole life, than, that none but his intimate friends
ever discovered he was a great poet by his discourse. Besides the decency of this ruIe, it is certainly founded in
good policy. A man who talks of any thing he is already
famous forl, has little to get, but a great deal to-lose.
18. I mig'ht add, that he who is sometimes silent on a
subject, where every one is satisfied he wvould speak well,
Iwill often be thought no less knowing in any other mnatters where, perhaps, he is wholly ignorant.

mnan of senlse, ftom thle flattery of sycophtants, and admiration of fools.
Raillery is no longer agreeable, than while the whole

~O2. Though good-humour, sense, and discretion, can
seldom fail to make a man agieeable, it may be no ill policy sometimes to prepare yourself in a particular manner
for conversation, by looking a little fartherthan your neighbours intoj whatever is become- a reigning subject. If

if you have nicely informed yourself of the strength, situation andlhistory of the first, or of the reasons for and
against the latter.
21. It -will have the same effect if,-when any single
person begins to make a noise in the world, you can learn
some of itie smallest accidents in his life or conversation,
which, though they are too fine for the observation of -the
vulgar, give more satisfaction to men of sense, (as they are
the best openings to a real character) than the recital of his
most glaring actions. I knfow but one ill consequence to
be'feared from this method, namely, that coming full
charged into company, yc'.l should resolve to unload,
whether an handspine opportunity offers itself or no.
22. The liberal arts, tliough tlley may possibly have less
effect on ou-r external mein zand behaviour, make so deep
an impression on the mind, as is very apt to bend it wholly
one way,
The miathematician will take little less than demonstration in the most common discourse; and the schoolman is
as great a friend to definitions and syllogisms. The physician and dMvine are often heard to dictate in private companies with. the same authority which they exercise: over
tiheir patients and disciples; while. the lawxyer is putting
cases, and raising matter for disputation, outof every thing
that occurs..23. Though the asking of questions may plead for itself
the spacious name of modesty, and a desire of information,
it affords little pleasure to the rest of the company, who
are not troubled with the same doubts; besides whichl, he
Who asks a question would do well to consider that he lies

take in what they call speaking their minds. A man of
this make will say a rude thiug for the mere pleasure of18    The Young Gentlentn and Lady's Monitor,

has often at a sitting, drank five or six bottles to his own

for I would not wish to think him a beast.
24.'These and many more are the follies of idle people,
which, while they think they procure them esteem, in
reality make them despised.
aTo avoid this contempt, therefore, never speak of yourself at all, unless necessity obliges you; and even then,
take care to do it in such a manper, that it may not be
construed into fislhing for applause. Whatever perfections you may have, be assured, people will find them
out; but whether they do or not, nobody will take them
upon 3your oMwn word. The less you say of yourself, the
more the world will give you credit for; and the mere
you say, the less they will believe you.
Alfectatio7?.
1. A I.ATE conversation which I fell into, gave me an
opportunity of observing a great deal of beauty in a very
handsome woman, and as much wit in an ingenious man,
turned into deformity in thle one, and absurdity in the
other, by the mere force of affectation. T he fair olne had
something in her person upon which her thougllts were
fixed, that she attempted to shew t_ advantage in every
look, word and gesture.
2. The gentleman was as diligent to do justice to his fine
parts, as the lady to her beauteous form: you might see
his imagination on the stretch to find out something uncommon, and what they call bright, $q, entertain her:
while she writhed herself into as many'diffcrent postures
to engage him. WVhen she laughed, her lips,were to sever
at a greater distance than ordinary to shew her teeth.
3. Her fan was to point to somewhat at a distance, that
in the reach she may discover the roundness of her arm;
then she is utterly imistaken in what she saw, falls back,
smiles at her own folly, and is so wholly discomposed, that
her tucker is to be adjusted, her bosom exposed, and the
whole woman put into new airs and graces.
4. While she was doing all this, the gallant had time to
think of something very pleasanttosay next to her, or make

possibly you are endeavoluring to bring over another to
your opinion, which is firmly fixed, you seeim only to de,

27. In orde.r t.o keep that temper, which is so difficult..nd yet so necesary to preserve, you may please' to conl

It is yet more absurd too be angry wi-th a man, because
he does not apprehend the force of your reasons, or give

argument, which is information, it.may be a seasonable
check to you. passion; for if you,search purely after truth,
it will be almost indifferent to you where you find it, I
cannot in this place omit an observation which I have
often made,---namely, that nothing procures a. mnan miore
esteem and less envy from the whole.compan-y, than if he

38. Some people have a trick of holding the persons
they are speaking to by the button, or the hand, in order
to be heard out; conscious, I suppose, that their tale is
tiresome-. Pray, never do this; if the person you speak
to is not as willing to hear your story a-s you are to tell it,
you had much better break off in the middle: for if you
tire them once, they will be afraid to listen to you a second time.
39. Others have a way of punching the person they are
talking to in the side, and at the end of every sentence,
asking him some questions as the following--" Wasn't I' right in that?"--" You know, I told you so."-" WVhat's
"your opinion?" and the like; or, perhaps, they Will be

Umfortunate man present; generally the most silent one of
the company, or probably him who sits next t'henm. To
this mnia- in a kin.l of 11alf wvhisper, they will r un oil for
half an hour together. Nothing canl be mlore ill-bred, But,
if one of these un1merciful talkers should attack you, if you
wish to oblig,e him, I would recommend the hearing- with
patielnce: seem to do so at least, for yoti could not hffrt
him more than to leave him in the middle of his story, oA
discover any impatience in the course of it.
41 I. Incessant talkers are very disag'reeable co-mpanions.
Nothing can be mole rude thant to engross the conversation
to yourself, or to take the words, as it were, out of another
ian's mouth. Every man in company has an-equal claini
to bear his part ini the conversationl, and to deprive him of
it, is not only unjust, but a tacit decl;aration that he cannot
speak so well upon the subject as yourself: you will therefoie take it up. And,- what can be more rude? I would
a'-soon forgive a man that should stop my mouth when
I was gaping, as take my wolds -from nme wlile I wvas

42. It cannot be less so to help out or forestall the slow

43. Those who contradict others vupon all-occasions, and
mnake every assertion a matter of dispute, betray by this
behaviour an tinacquaintance with good-breeding. He,
therefore, who wishes to appear amiable, with those he
converses with, will be cautious of such expressions as
th ese,' That can'lt be true, sir." "6 The affair is as I say.."
l That'must be ta.lse, sir."' If what you say is trlue, &amp;c.'
You mnay as vwell tell a man he lies at once, as thus indirectly impeachl his veracity. It is equally as rude to be
proviiig every trifling assertion with a bet or a wager--
" I'll bet you fifty of it," and-so on. Make it then a constant ruXle, in matters of no great importance, complaisantly to sublait your opinion to thbt of' others; for a victory
of this kind often costs a main the loss of a friend.;444 Givilng advice u-ilasked, is another piece of luideness: it is, inl eaect, declarin-g ourselves wiser th-an those

of gi eater arrogance to expect every one to subimit to their

45. li reie is nothing so unpardonably rude, as a seemiing inattention to th.e peirson who is speakling to you; tho'
yolu may meet with it in others, by all means avoid it yoursel. Some ill-bred people, wxhile others arle speaking to
them,  will- instead of looking at o' attending to themn perhaps fix theiL eyes on the ceiling,- or some pictuire ill tihe
room, look out of the windowv, play with 2a dog, their

their noses. Notling betrays a more trifling mind.than
t his; nor can any thing be a greater affriont to the person
speakling; it being a tacit declaration, that what he is
saying is not worth yo-ur attention.  Considerl with your.
self how you iould like such treatment, and, I am persuade,:, you will never shew it to otheirs.
46. Surliiess or moroseness is incompatible also with
politeness.  Suchi as, should any one say " he was desired.and Engslish Teache-r's Assistant.  2 S9

adapt your conversation to the company you are in. You

ho; your'good sense will Lundoubtedly teach you to be
serious with the serious, gay with tihe gay, and to trifl
with t-le triflers.
48. There are certain expressionswhich are exceedingly
rlide, and' yet there are people of liberal education that
sometimes use' them; as, " You donl't understand me, sir."
" Is it not so?" "YoIu mistake." " You know notling of
" t!he matter," &amp;c. Is it not- better to say,, "I believe I
t" do not express myself so asto be understood."  " Let us
"counsider it again, whethe r we'take it right or not.Y'  It
is much more polite and amiable to maie somne excuse for
another,,even in cases whelrehe might justly be blamed,
and to repcesent the mistake as common to both, rather
than charge him wvith insenlsibility or incolmprehension.
49. If any one'should have promised you any thing, and
not have fulfilled that promise, it would be very unpolite
to tell-him he has forfeited his word; or if thesame person
shoulcl have disappointed you, u:pon any occasion, would
it inot be better to say,'" You were Iprobably so much en" g:aged, that you forgot my affair-;" or, "perhaps it slipped'" your memory;" rather than, "' you thought no more
4' about it:"' or, " you pay very little regard to your word.'I
For expressions of this'kind leave a sting behind thenlm
They are a kind of provocation and affeont, and very often
bring on lasting quarrels.
50. Be careful not to appear dark and mysterious, lest
you should be thought suspiQious; than which, there cannot be a more unamiable character, If you appearl mysterious and reserved, others will be truly so with you. and
x2240   The Yoting'Gent lenzan and Lady's Monitor,
in this case, there is an end to improvement, for you.
-will gather no, information.  Be reserved, but never
seem so.
S 1. There is a fault extremely common with some people, which I would have you avoid. -Vlhen their opinion
is asked upon ainy subject, they will give it with so apparent'a diffidence and timidity, that one cannot, without
the utmost pain, listen to them; especially if they are
known to be n-en of universal knowledge. "' Your Lord" ship will pardon me," says one of this stamp, " if I1
" should not be able to speak to the case in hand, so well
"as it might be wished."-4- I'll venture to speak of this
" matter to the best of my poor abilities and dullness of' apprehension."-"' I fear I shall expose myself, but in
".obedience to your Lordship's commands,"--and while
they are making these apologies, they interrupt the busi&gt;ness and tire the colmpany.
52. Always look people in the face when you speak to
them, otherwise you will be thought conscious of some
guilt'; besides, you lose the opportunity of reading their
countenances; from which you will much better learn the
impressi6n youir discourse' makes upon them, than you
can possibly do frommtheir words,; for words are at the
will of every one, but the countenance is -frequently in,
voluntary.
53. If,-in speaking' to a person, you are not heardl, and
should be desired to repeat what you said, do not raise
your voice in the repetition, lest youl should be thought
angry, on being obliged to repeat what you had said before; it was probably owing to the hearer's inattention.
54. One word only, as to swearing. Those who addict
theinselves to it, and interlard their discourse with oaths,
can never be colisidered as gentlemen; they are generally
people of low education, and are urlwelcome in what is
called good company. It'is a vice that has no temptation
to plead, but is, in every respect, as vulgar as it is wicked.
55. Never accustom yourself to scandal, nor listen to it;
for though it may gratify the malevolence of some people,
nine times out of ten it is attended with great disadvantages. The very person you tell it to, will, on reflection,
entertain a mean opinion of you, and it will often bring
you into a veily disagreeable sittuation. And as thereand 2zglzishi TeaLcher's Assista-nt.  241
%would be no evil-speakers, if there were io,evii-hearers,
it is3 in scandal as in robbery; the receiver is as:bad as the
thief. Besides, it will lead people to shun your comnpany, supposing)hthat you would speak ill of them to the next
accluaintance you meet.
56. Carefully avoid talking either of your own or other
people's domestic concernso  By doing the one you will
be thought vain; by entering into the other, you.will be
considered as oTficious. -Talking of yourself is an impertinence to the comnpany; yotr affairs ares nothing to them;
besides, they cannot be kept too secret. And as to'the
affairs of others, what are they to you? In talking of matters that no way concern you, you are liable to commit
blunders, and, should you touch'any one in a sore part, you
may, possibl y lose his esteem. Let your conversation,
then, in mixed companies, always be general.
57. Jokes, bon-mots, or the little pleasantries of one company, will not often bear to be told ih another; they are
frequently local, and take their rise from certain circumstances; a second company may not be acquainted With
these circumstances, and of course your story 1nay not be
understood, or want explaining-; and if, after you have
prefacedlit with, "I will tell you a good thing," the sting
should not be immediately perceived, you will appear e'xceedingly ridiculous, and wish you had not told it. Never,
then, repeat in one place what you hear in another.
58. In most debates, take up the favourable side of the
question; however, let me caution you against being clamnorous; that is, never maintain an argument with heat
though you know yourself right; but offer your sentiments
mnodestly and coolly; and, if this does not prevail, give it
up, and try to change the subject, by saying something to
this, eifect, " I find we shall hardly convince one another,
"neither is there any necessity-to attempt it; so let us talk
"' of something, else."
59. Not that I would have you give up your opinion
always; no, assert your own sentiments, and oppose those
of others.when wrong, but let your manner and voice be
gentle and engaging, and yet no ways affected. If you
coiitradict, do it with, I mnay be zwrong, but-I won't be
piositive, but I really think-I should rather sufiose--If I
may be zermittcd to 0ay-l-ad. close your dispute with good242   Tlhe Young Genztleman and Lady's Monitor,
humour, to shew you are neither displeased yourself, nor
meantto displease the person you dispute with.60Q. Acquaint yourself with the character and situation
of the company you go into, befole you give a loose to
your tongue; Tor should you enlarge on some virtue, which
any one present may notoriously want t or should you con.
demn some vice5 w'hich anlly of the company may be particularly addicted to, they will be apt to think your reflections pointed and personal, and' you will he sulre to give
offence. This consideration will naturally lead you, not
to stlppose things said in general to be levelled at you.
61. Low-bred people, when-they happen occasionally to
be in good company, imagine themselves to be the subject
of every separate convers'ation. If any part of the company whis~pers, it is about them; if they laugh, it is at
them; and if any thing is said, wihich they do not comprehend, they immediatelV suppose it is meant of them.--
This. mistake is admirably ridiculed in one of our celebrated comedies, ( Iam nsure, says Scrub, they were talk" ing of me, Jbr they lazughed consumedlyl."
62. Now, a well-bred person never thinks--himself disesteemed by the company, or laughed at, unless their reflections are so gross, that he cannot be supposed to mistake them, and his honour oblige: him to resent it in a
proper manner; howeves', be assured, gentlemen never
laugh at or ridicule one another, uniless they are in joke,
or on a footing of the greatest intimacy. If such a thing
should happen once in an age, from some pert-coxcomb,
or some flippant woman, it is better not to seem to know
it, than to make the least reply.
63. It is a piece of politeness not to interrupt a person in
a story, whether you have heard it before or not. Nay,
if a well-bred man is asked whether he has heard it, he
will answer no, and let the person go on, though he knows
it already. Some are fond of telling a story, because they
think they tell it well; others pride themselves in bein g the
first teller of it, and others are pleased at being thought
entrusted with it. - Now, all these persons you would is.,
appoint by answering yes; and, as I have told you before,
as the greatest proof of politeness is to make every body
happy about you, I wvould never deprive a person of any
secret satisfaction of this solt, when I could gratify by a
iminute's attentionlmind Anglish Teacher's Assistant.  243
64. fBe not ashamedl of asking' questions, if such questions lead to information: always accompany them witli
some excuse, and you will never be reckoned impertinent.
But, abrupt questions, without some apology, by all means
avoid, as they imply design. There is a way of fishing foir
facts, which, if done judiciously, will answer everiy piur
pose, such as taking things you wish tg know for granted:
this will, perhaps, lead some officious person to set you
right. So again, by saying, you have heard so and so,
and sometimes seeming to know. more than you do, you
will often get an information, wvhich you would lose by
direct questions, as these woulld put people upon their
guard, and frequently defeat the very end you aim at.
65. Make it a rule never to reflect on any body of people, for by this means you will create a number of enemies. Thele are goodl and bad of all professions,lawyers,
soldiers, parsons or: citizens. They arC all men, subject
to the salne passions, differing only in their manner according to the way they have been bred up in. For this
reason, it is unjust, as well as indiscreet, to attack them as
a co'fis colectively. Many a young man has thought
himself extl'emely clever in abusing the clergy. VWhat
are the clergy more than other men? Can you suppose a
black gown can imake any alteration in his nature? Fie,
fies think seriously, and I am convinced you will never
do it.
66. But above all, let no example, no fashion, no witticism, no foolish desire of rising above what knaves call
prejudices, tempt you to excuse, extenuate or ridicule the
least breach of morality, but upon every occasion shew the
greatest abhorrence'of such proceedings, and lold virtue
and religion in the highest veneration.
It is a great piece of ill-imanners to interrupt any one
while speaking, by spealkiig yoiurself, or calling off the attention of the company to aniy foreigig matter. But this
every cliild knows.
67. The last thing I shall mention, is that of concealing
your learning, except on particular occasions. Reserve
this for learnei men, and let them rather extort-it froml
you, than you be too willing to display it. Hence you will
be thoug'ht modest, and to have more knowledge than yon
really have. Never seem lmore wise or learned than theeid  ngzttlish Teacher's Assistant.    19
vanity. These unhappy effects of affectation naturally led
me to look into that strange state of nmind, which so generally discolours the behaviour of most people we meet wvith..5. The learned Dr. Bzcrnet, in his Theory Qf the Earth,
takes occasion to observe, that every thought is attenled
with consciousness and representativeness; the mind has
nothing presented to it, but what is immediately followed
by a reflection of conscience, which tells you whether that
which was so presented is graceful or unbecoming.
6. This-act of the mind discovers itself in the gesture,
by a proper:ehaviour in those whose consciousness goe;
no farther than to direct them in the just progress of their
present thought or action; but betrays an interruption i1
every second thought, when the consciousness is eniDploved
in too fondly approving a man's own conceptions; wl.ich
sort of consciousness is what we call affectation.
7. As the love of praise is implanted in ouri bosoms as a
strong incentive to Nworthyll actionis; it is a very difficult
task to get abore a desire of it for things tlat should be
wholl'y iJldiffleent.  V olmen, whose hearts are fixed uponl
the -pleasure thiey have in the consciousness that they are
the ol)jects of love and admiration, are ever chawling the
air of their countenances, and altering the attitude bf their
bodies, to strike the hearts of their beholdelrs with a new
sense of their beauty.
8. The dressing part of our ses, whose minds are the
same with the sillier part of the other, are exactly in tho
like uneasy condition to be regarded for a well tied cravat,
ani hat cocked with an unusual briskness, a very vell chosen coat, or other instances of merit, which they are impatient to see unobserve(l.
9. But this apparent affectation, arising from an ill governed consciousness, is not so much to be wondlered at
in stucl loose and trivial minds as these. But when you
see it reign in characters of worth and distinction, it is
what you cannot but lament, nor without some indignation. It creeps into the heart of the wise man, as wvell as
that of the coxcomb.
10. lWhen you see a man of sense look about for ap1
plause, and discover an itching inclination to be commnenldd; lay traps for a little incense, even from those
whose 9pinion he values,in nothinlg but his own favour;
c244  7The Young Gentleman and Lady's Monitor,
company you are in. He who affects to shlew hlis Iear'n
ing: willbe firequentlyqvuestioned; and if fouind superficial,
will be sneered at; if otherwise, he will be deemed a pedant. Real merit will always shew itself, and nothing
can lessen it in the olinion of the world, but a iman's exhibiting it himself.
For God's sake, revolve all these thing's seriously in
your mind, before you ggo abroad into life. Recollect the
observations you'have yourself occasionally'made upon
men and things; compare them with my instruztiols, and
act w,isely and consequentially, as they shall teach you.

Advice to a young Man.,
1. I PRESUME you desire to be happy he an,d here,
after; you know ther,e are a thousand -diftlfilties which
attend this pursuit:; soxMe of th.em perhaps you foresee,
but there are multitudes which you-could never think of.
NTever trust therefore to your-own undlerstanding in the
things of this world, where you can have the advice of a
Wvise and faithful friend; nor dare venture the more imra
portant concerns of your soul, and your eternal interests in
the world to come., tipon the miere light of nature, and the
dictates of your own reason; since the word of God, and
the advice of Heavea, lies in your hands.  Vain and,thoughtless indeed are those children of pride, who chuse
to turn heathens in America; who live uponthpe mere relfi
gion of nature and their own stock,.when they have been
trained up among all these -superior advantages of Christianity, and'the blessings of.divine revelation and grace!
2. -Whatsoever your circumstances may be in this worild,
still value your bible as your best treasure; and whatsoever
be your employment here, still look upon,reiigion as your
best business. Your bible contains eternal life in it, and
all the riches of the upper world; and religion is the only
way to become the possessor of them.
3. To direct your carJiage towards God, converse particularlly with the book of Psalms; David was a man of sin,
cere and eminent devotion. To behave  aright:among men,
acquaint youtrself witl thei whole book of Proverbs: Solomon was a man of large experience and wisdom. And
to:perfect your directions in both these, read the Gospels
and Epistles; you will find the best of rules and the best
of examples there, and those more immediately sui'ted to
the Christian life.
4. As a man, maintain strict tem-perance.and sobriety,
by a wise government of your appetites and passions; as a
neighbour, influence and engage all arbund you to be your
friends, by a temper and carriage made up of pr'udence.
and goodness; and let the poor have a certain share in all
your yearly profits; as a trader, keep that golden sentence
of our Savipur's ever before you. Whatsoever you" would.6 that men should do unto you, do you also unto them."
$S While you make the precepts- of scripture tile cWar246    The Young Gen-tleman and Ladfs,.Monitor,
stant rule of your duty, you maywith courage' rest upon the
promises of scripture as the springs of your encouragement; all divine assistances and divine recompenc:es are
contained in them. The spirit of-light and grace is promised to.assist them that ask it, Heaven and:glory are
promised to reward the faithfful and the obedient.
6. In'every affair of life, begin with God; consult him
illn every thing that concerns you; view him as the author
of all your blessings, and.all your hopes, as y.our best
friend, and your.eternal portion. Mleditate on h im in this
view, with a continual renewal of your trust in'himll, and
a daily surrender of yourself-to hi.m, till you feel that you
love him most enltirely, that you serve him with sincere del
light, and that you cannot live a day without God in the
world.
7. You know yourself to be a man, an indig.ent creature
and a sinner, and you profess to be a Christian, a disciple of
the blessed Jesus, but -never think you know Christ or
yourself as you ought till you find'adaily need of him for
righteousness and strength, for pardon and sanctification;
and let hi-m be your constant introducer to the great Gold,
though he sits upon a throne of grace. Remember his own
words, John xivl 6. "No man cometh to the father but by
8. Make prayer a pleasure, and not a task, and thein
you will not forget nor omitit it  If ever you have lived
in a praying family, never let it be your fault if you do
not live in one always. Believe that day, that hour, or,
those minutes to be wasted and lost, which any worldly
pretences would temptyou to save out of the public worship of the church, the certain -and constant duties of the
closet, or any necessary services for God and godliness;
beware lest a blast attend it, and not a blessing. If God
had not reserved one day in seven to himself, I. fear religion would have been lost out of the world; and every
day of the week is exposed to a curse which has no morning religion.
9. See that you watch and labour, as well as pray; diligence and dependence must be united in the practice of
every Christian. It is the same wise man acquaints us,
that the hand of the.diligentj and the blessing ofthe Lord,
join together to make us rich, Prov-.,x 4. 22. Rich: in the
teasures of body or mind, of dimeor eternity.and English T7hacher's Assistant-    24?
It is your duty indeed, under a sense of your own weakTess, to pray daily against sin; but if you would ef'ectually
avoid it, you must also avoid temptation, and every dangerous opportunity. Set a double guard wheresoever you
feel or suspect an enemy at hanld. The world without, and
the heart within, have so mauch flatterv and deceit in them,
that we must keep a sharp eye upon both, lest we are trapt
into mischief between them.
lo. Honour, profit, and pleasure, have been sometimes
called the world's Trinity; they are its three chief idols;
-each of them is sufficilnt to draw a soul off from God,
and ruin it for ever. Beware of them, therefore, and of
all their subtle insinuations,  if you would be innocenit o,
happy.
Remember that the honour which comes from God, thL
approbation of Heaven, ainid vour own conscience, are infinitely more valuable than. all the esteem or applause of
men. Dare not venture one step out of the road of Heaven, for. eair of being Jlaughed at for walking strictly in it p
it is a poor r eligion that cannot stand against a jest.
Sell not your hopes of heavenly treasures, nlor any thin t
that belongs to yqour eternal interest, for any of the advantages of the present life: " XWhat sh'ail it profit a man to;
"1 gain the w%vorld and lose lhis own scul."
Remember also the words of the wise lman, 4"'  e'thalt
4" loveth pleasure shall be a poor man;" he that indulge%
himself in " -wine and oil," that is, in drinking, in,feasting, and in sensual gratifications, ",shall not be rich."  It
is one of St. Paul'scharacters of a most degenerate age,
when " nmen become lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
"{ God.' And that-" fleshly lusts war ag,ainst the soul,";is
St. Peter's caveat to the Christians of his time.
11. Preserve your conscience always soft and sensible;
if but one sin force its way into that tender part of the soul,
and dwell easy there, the road is paved for a thousand
iniquities.
And take hee -th'at lunder any scruple, doubt, or temp,
tation whatsoever, you never let any reasonings satisfy
your conscience, which will not be a sufficient answer or
apology to the -great Jud e at the last day.
12. Keep this thought ever in your mind, It is a world'vanity and vexation in which you live; the flatteries aMnd48    Thze Young Gentleman and Lady's Monitol,
promises of it are vain and deceitful; prepare, thereforep
to meet disappointments. Many of its occurrences are
teazing and vexatious, In every ruffling storm without,
possess your spirit in patience, and let all be calm and serene within. Clouds and tempests are only found in the
lower skies; the heaxvens above are ever bright and clear.
Let your heart and hope dwell much in these serene regions; live as a stranger here on earth, but as a citizen of
iLeaven, if you will maintain a soul at ease,
13. Since in many things we offend all, and there is not
a day passes which is perfectly free from sin, let " repent.
$' ance towards God, and faith in our. Lord Jesus Christ,'3
be your daily work. A frequent renewal of these exer?
cises which make a Christian at first, will be a constant
evidence of your sincere Christianity, and give you peace
ln. life, and hope in death.
14. Ever carry about with you such a sense of the un,
certainty of every -thing in this life, and of life itself, as to,ut nothing off till to-morrow, which you can conveniently
cdo to-day. Dilatory persons are frequently exposed to sur?
prise and hurry in every-;hing that belongs to them; the
time is come, and they are unprepared. Let the con,
cerns of your soul and your:shop your trade and your religion, lie always in suclih; order, as far as possib!le, that
oleath, at a short warning, may be no occasion of a disquieting tumult in your spirita and that you may escape the
anguish of a bitter repentance in a dying hour. Farewel;
PhroIlimus, a considerable East-land merchant, happened upon a copy of these advices, about the time when he
permitted his son to commence a partnership with him
in his trade; he transcribed them with his own hand, and
3nade a present of them to the youth, together with the
articles of partnership. Here, young man, said he, is a
paper of more worth than these articles. Read it over

1. ON the fifth day of the moon, which, according to
the. custom of my fQrefathr.s), I always lkeep holy, afednd rEndisA Teacher's Assistant.    249
ha~t1ng washed myself, and offered up my morning devotions, I ascendeld the higlh hills of Bagdalt, in order to pas:a
the rest of the day in meditation and prayer. As I was
here airiniil myseif on the tops of the rmountainst I fell into
a profound contemplation on. the vanity of human life;
and passing from one thought to another, surely, said I,
man is bhut a shadow, and life a dream,
2. \~Whilst I was thus musing, I ca:st my eyes towardIs
the sumrmit of a rock that was not far firomn me, where I
discovered one in the habit of a shepherd, with a little
nusical instrument in his hand. As I looked upon him,
he applied it to his lips, and began to play upon it. The
sound of it w.as exceeding sweet, and wrought into a variety of tunes that were inexpressibly melodious, and altogether different from any thing I had ever heard-: they
put me in mind of those heavenly airs that are played to
the departed souls of good men upon their first arrival in
Paradise, to wear out the impressions of the last agonies,
and qualify them for the pleasures of that happy place.
My heart melted away in secret raptures.
i. T had oftei be  t  that -the rock, obefore ie was tha
haunt of a geniius; and that several had been entertained
with that music, who hadi passed by it, but never heard
that the musician had before made himself visible. WVhen
he had raised my thoughts by those transporting airs
which he played, to taste the pleasures of his conversation,
as I looked upon him like one astonished, he beckoned
to me, and, by the wavinig of his hand, directed me to
approach the place where he sat.
4. I drew nearl.with that reverence which is due to a
superior nature; and as my heart was entirely subdued by
the captivating. strains I had heard, I fell down at his feet
and( wept. The genius smiled on me with a look of compassion and affability, that familiarized him to my imagination, and at once dispelled all the fears and apprehensions
with which I approaclled him. He lifted me from the
ground, and taking me by the hand, Mirza, said he, I
have heard thee in thy soliloquies: follow me.
5. He then led me to the highest pinnacle of the rock,
and placing me on the top of it, cast thy eyes eastward,
said he, anid tell me what thou seest. I see, saitd I, a huge
valley, and a prodigious tide of water rolling through it.2-0 o   he Yaung.Gen7tkme7a:and Lad's--TIoifoI,
The-valley that thou seest, said, he, is the vale of rnisery7
and the tide of water that thou seest- is part of the. great
tide of eternity.
6. What is the reason,. said I, that the tide I see rises
out of a thick mist at one end, and again loses itself in
a thick mist at the. other? What th.ou seest, said he, is
that portion of eternity which is called time, measured
out by the sun, and reaching froln the beginninlg of the
world to its consummlation. Examine now, said lhe,this
sea that is bounded with darkness at botfi ends, and tell
mne what thou discoverest in it. I see a bridge, said I1
standing in the midstof the tide. The bridge thou seestl
said he, is human life; consider it attentively.
7. Upon a more leisurely survey of it, I found that it
consisted of threescore and ten entire arches, with several
broken arches, which, added to those that were entire,
iaiade up the number of about an- hundred. As I was
counting the arches, the genius told me that this bridge
consisted at the first of a thousand arches; but that a great
flood swept away the rest, and left the bridge in the ruinui- condiftiow--It now-be-h-el-dit--;- bult tell me fturther,' sail.
he, what thou discoverest on it. I see multitudes of peo-:ple passing over it) said I, and a black cloud hanging oIL
each end of it.
8. As I looked more attentively, I saw several of the
passengers dropping through the bridge, into the great.
tide that flowed underneath it; and upon further examiination, perceived there were innumerable trap-doors that
lay concealed in the bridge, w1hich the passengers no
sooner trod upon, but they fell through them into the
tide, and imnmediately disappeared. These hidden pitfalls were set very thick at the entrance of the bridge, so
that throngs of people no sooner broke through the cloudy
but many of them fell into them. They grew thinner,
towards the'middle, but multiplied and lay closer together
towards the end of the arche that welre entire.
9. There were indeed some persons, but their number
was very small, that continued a kind of hobbling march
on the broken arches, but fell through one after another,
being quite tired and spent with so loing a walk.
10. I passed some time in the contemplation of this
wonderful structure, and the great variety of objects whichantd English Teacher's Assistant.  25 I
it presented. My heart: was filled with a deep melancholy, to see several dropping unexpectedly in the midst of
mirth and jollity, and catching at every thing that stood by
them to save themselves. Some were looking up towards
the heavens in a tlloughtful posture, and in the midst of
a speculation, stumbled and fell out of sight. Multittudes
wvere very busy in the pursuit of bubbles, that glittered in
their eyes and danced before them; but often, when they
thought themselves within the reach of them, their footing
failed, and down they sunk.
11. In this confiusion of objects, I observed some with
scymitars in their hands, and others with urinals, who ran
to and fro upon the bridge, thrusting several persons on
trap-doors, which did not seem to lie in their way, and
which they might have escaped, had they not been thus
forced upon them.
12, The genius, seeing me indul,ge myself in this melancholy prospect, told me I had dwelt long enough upon it  
take thine eyes off the bridge, says he, and tell me if thou.
seest any thing thou dost not comprehend. Upon looking
up,what mean, said I, those great flights of birds that are
perpetually hovering about the bridge, and settling upon
it from time to time? I see vultures) harpies, ravens, cormorants, and, among many other feathered creatures, several little winged boys,: that perch in great numbers upon the middle arches. These, said the genius, are enyy,
avarice, superstition, despair, love, with the like cares
and passions that infest human life.
13. I here fetched a deep sigh: Alas, said I, man was
made in vain! how is he-given away to misery and mortality! tortured in life, and swallowed up in death! The
genius, being moved with compassion towards me, bid me
quit so uncomfortable a prospect. Look no more, said he,
on man in the first stage of his existence, in his setting
out for eternity; but cast thine eye on that thick mist into
whichl the tide bears the several generations of mortals
that fall into it.
14. I directed my sight as I was ordered, and (vwhether
or no the good genius strengthened it with any supernatural force, or dissipated part of3 the mist that was before too
thick:for the eye to penetrate) I saw the valley opening
at the falther end, and spreading forth into an immense
x2252  7The Younzg Gentlemnan and Lacdy's Monitor,
ocean, that had a huge rock of adamant running through
the midst of it, and dividing it into two equal parts. The
clouds still rested on one half of i.t, insomuch that I could
discover nothing in it; but the otler ajppeared to nle a vast
ocean, planted with innumerable islands, that ivere covered with fruits and flowers; and interwoven with a thousand
little shining seas that ran among them.
15. I could see persons dressed in glorious habits, with
garlands upon their heads, passing among the trees, lying
down by the sides of fountains, or resting on beds of flowers; and could hear a confused harmony of singing birds,
falling waters, human voices, and musical instruments.
Gladness grew in me at the discovery of so delightful a
scene. I wished for the wings of an eagle, that I mig3ht
fly away to those happy seats; but the genius told me
there was no passage to them, except through the gates of
death that I saw opening every momlent upon the bridge.
16. The islands, said he, that lie so fresh and green before thee, and with which the whole face of the ocean appears spotted as far as thou canst see, are more in number than the sand on the sea-shore; there are nzyriacls of
islands behind those which thou here discoverest, reaching
further than thine eye, or even thine imagination can extend itself.'hese are the mansions of good mein after
death, who, according to the degree and kinds of virtue in
xvhich they excelled, are distributed among these several
islands, which abound with pleasures of differfent kinds and
degrees, suitalile to the relishes and perfections of those
who are settled in them; every island is a paradise, accommnodatecl to its respective inhabitants.
17. Are not these, 0 MiIirza, habitations worth contending for? Does life appear miserable, that gives thee opportunities of earning such a reward?-Is death to be feared,
that will convey thee to so happy an existence? T'hink not
man was mnade in vain, who has such an eternity reserved for him. I g,azed,with inexpressible pleasure,on these
happy islands. At length, said I, shew me now, I, beseech thee, the secrets that lie hid under those dark
clouds, which cover the ocean on the other side of the rock
of adamant.

had been so long contemplating: but instead of the rolling

and camels grazing upon the sides of it.
Riches znot productive of HIapiizess: Tle Story of
Ortogrul of Basra.
IDLER, NO. 99.
1. AS Ortog'rul of Basra was one day wandering along
the streets of Bagdat, musing on the varieties of merchandize whIich the shops o:Tered to his view, and observing
the different occupations which busied tile nultitude on
every side, he was awakened from the tranquillity of meditation by a crowd that obstructed his passage. He raisedl
his eyes, and saw the Chief Vizier, who, having returned
from the Divan, was entering his palace.
2. Ortogrul mingled wvith the attendants, and being supposed to have some petition for the Vizier, was permitted
to enter. He surveyed the spaciousness of the apartments, admired the walls hung with golden tapestry, and
the floors covered with silk,en carpets, and despised the
simple neatness of his own little habitation.
3. Surely, said he to himself, this palace is the seat of
happiness, where pleasure succeeds to pleasure, and disconltent and sorrow can have no admission. Whatever
nature has provided for the delight of sense, is here spread
forth to be enjoyed. NVWhat can mortals hope or imagine;
which the master of this palace has not obtained? The
dishes of luxury cover his table, the voice of harmony
lulls him in his bowers; he breathes the fragrance of the
groves of Java, and sleeps upon the down of the cygnc:ts
of Ganges. He speaks, and his mandate is obeyed; he
wishes, and hiswish is gratified! all whom he sees obey
him, and all whom he hears flatter him.
4. How different, Ortogrul, is thy condition, who art
doomedl  to the perpetual torments of unsatisfied desire,
and whlo hast'no amusemlent in thy power that can withhold thee from thy own reflections i They tell thee that
thou art wise, but what does wisdom avail with poverty?
N.one will flatter tlie poor, an( the wise have very little
2;oThe Young Gentleman and Lady's Monitor,
who is safe against this weakness? or who knows whether
he is guilty of it or not? The best way to get clear of such
a light fondness for applause is, to take all possible care
to throw off the love of it upon occasions that are not in
themselves laudable; but, as it appears, we hope for no
praise from them.
1 1. Of this nature are all graces in men's persons, dress,
and bodily deportment; which will naturally be winning
and attractive if we think not of them, but lose their force
in proportion to our endeavour to make them such.
When our consciousness turns upon the main design of
life, and our thoughts are employed upon the chief pur..ose either in business or pleasure, we should never betray an affectation, for we cannot be guilty of it, but when
we give the passion for praise an unbridled liberty, our
pleasure in little perfections robs us of what is due to us
for great virtues and worthy qualities.
12. How many excellent speeches and honest actions.are lost, for want of being indifferent where we ought!
Men are oppressed with regard to their way of speaking
and acting, instead of having their thoughts bent upon
what they should do or say; and by that means bury a
capacity for great things, by their fear of failing in indifferent things. This, perhaps, cannot be calle(l affectation; but it has some tincture of it, at least so far, as that
their fear of erring in a thing of no consequence argues
they would be too much pleased in performing it.
13. It is only from a thorough disregard to himself in
such particulars, that a man can act with a laudable sufficiency; his heart is fixed upon one point in view; and
he commits Ino errors, because he thinks nothing an error
but xwhat deviates fiom that intention.
The wild havock affectation makes in that part of the
world which should be most polite, is visible wherever
we turn our eyes; it puslhes men not only into impertinences in conversation, but also in their premeditated
speeches.
14. At the bar it torments, the bench, whose business
it is to cut off all superfluities in what is spoken before it
by the practitioner; as well as several little pieces of injustice which arise from the law itself. I have seen it
matte a man run from the purpose before a judge, who254   T/7le Young Gentleina.z and Lady's Monitor,
power of flattering themselves. That man is surely the
most wretched of the sons of wretchedness, wlho lives with
his own faults and follies always before him, and who has
none to reconcile him to himself by praise and veneration.
I have long sought. content, and have not found it; I will
from this moment endeavour to be rich.
5-. Full of his new,resolution, he shut himself in his
chamber for six months, to deliberate how he should grow
rich; he sometimes proposed to offer himself as a counsellor to one of the kings of India, and sometimes resolved
to dig for diamonids in the mines of Golconda. One day,
after some hours passed in violent fluctuation of opinion,
sleep insensibly seized him in his chair; he dreamed that
he was ranging a desart country in search of some one
that might teach him to grow rich; and as he stood on
the top of a hill shaded with_-cypress, in doubt whitlier to
direct his steps, his father appeared on a sudden, standing
before him.
6. Ortogrul, said the old mani, I know thy perplexity;
listen to thy father; turn thine eye on the opposite mountain. Ortogrul looked, and saw a torrent tumbling down
the rocks, roaring with the noise of thunder, and scattering-its foam on the impending woods. Now, said his father, behold the valley that lies between the hills.
7. Ortogrul looked, and espied a little well, out of which
issued a small rivulet. Tell me now, said his father, dost
thou wish for sudden affluence, that may pour upon thee
like the mountain torrent, or for a slow and gradual-increase, resembling the rill gliding from the well? Let me
be quickly rich, said Ortogrul;. let the golden stream be
quick and viplent.
8. Look round thee, said his father, once again. Ortogrul looked, and perceived the channel of the torrent dry
and -dusty; but following the rivulet from the well, he
traced it to a wide lake, which-the supply, slow and constant, kept always full. He waked, and determined to
grow rich by silent profit, and persevering industry.
9. Having sold his patrimony, he engaged in merchandise, and in twenty years purchased lands, on which he
raised a house equal in sumptuousness to that of the Vizier, to which he invited all the ministers of pleasure, expecting to enjoy allthe- felicity which he had imaginedand.English TeacheerIs Assistant.  s'  
richleFs able to afford. Leisure soon made him weary of
himself, and he long'ed to be perlsuaded that Ile was great
and hlappy. He was courteous and liberal; he gave all
that approached him hopes of pleasing him, and all who
should please him, hopes of being rewarded. Every art
-f praise was triedc and every source of adulatory fiction
was exhaus-ted.
10. Ortogrul heard his flatterers without delight, be-cause he found himself unable to believe tliemn. His own
heart told him its frailties. His own understanding reproached. him with his faults. How long, said he, with a
deep sigh, have I been labouring in vain to amass wealth,
which at last is useless? Let no man hereafter wish to be
rich, who is already too wise to be flattered.
Of the Scriptures, as the Rule of Lfe.
1. AS you advance in years and understandling, I hope
you will be able to examine for yourself the evidence of
the Christian religion, and that you will be convinced, on
rational grounds, of its divine authority. At present) suchI
enquiries would demandmore study, and greater powiYer~s
of reasoning, than your age adinits, of. It is your part,
therefore, till you are capable of understanding the proofs,
to believe your parents and teachers, that the holy scriptures are writings inspired by God, containin g a true history of facts, in, which we are deeply concerned-a true
recital of the laws given by God to Moses, and of the precepts of our blessed Lord and Saviour, delivered from his
own 1mouth to his disciples, and repeated and enlarged
upon in the ectifying epistles of his Apostles; who were
men chosen firom amongst those' who had the acvant age of
conversing with our Lord, to bear witne'ss of his miracles
and resurrection-and lwho, after his ascension) were assisted and inspired by the Holy Ghost.
2. This sacred volume miust be the rule of your life.
In it vou will find all truths necessary to be believed; and
plain and easy directions for the practice of every duty.
Your bible, then, must be your chief study and delight:
but, as it contains miany various kinids of wr'iting-some
parts obscure and difiicult of interpretation, others plain
and intelligible to the meanest capacity-I would chiefly256    The Young Gentleman and Lady's AMonitor;
Vecommend to your frequent perisal, such pa'rts of the
sacred,writings as are most adapted to your tinderstanding,
and most necessary for' your instluction.
3. Our Saviour's precepts were spoke.n to the common
people amongst the Jews; and, were therefore given in a
manner easy to be understood, and equally striking and
instructive to the learned and unlearned; for the most i'g
norant may comprehend themn, whilst the wisest must be
charmed and awed by the beautiful and majestic simplicity with which they are expressed. Of the same kind are
the Ten Commandments, delivered by God to Moses;
Wvhich, as they were desigiled for universal laws, ar}e
worded in the most concise and simple manner, yet with
a majesty which comman-ds ouiF utmost reverence.
4. I think you will receive great pleasure, as well as improvement,, fromn the historical books of the OldTestament;
provided you read them as an history,Ain a regular course,
and keep the thread of it in your mind as you go on. I
know of none, true or fictitious, that is equally wonderful,
interestingl or affecting.; or that is told in so short and:
simple a manner as this, which is of all histories the most
authentic.
5. I shall give you some brief directions, concerning
the method and course I wish you to pursue, in reading
the Holy Scriptures. May you be enabled to niake the
best use of this most precious gift of G6d-this sacred
treasure of knowledge!--May you read the bible, not as
a task, n6r as the dtull employment of that day only in
which you are forbidden more lively entertainments-- blt,
with -a sincere and ardent desire of instructioni; with that
love andc delig-ht in God's word, which the h1oly Psalmist
so pathetically felt and described, and which is the natural
consequence of loving God and virtue.
6. Though I speak this of the bible in general, I wotld
not be understood to mean, that every part of the volume
is equally interesting. I have already said, that it consists
of various matter, and various kinds of books, which must
be read with.different views and sentimenits.
7.'rhe having some general notion of what you are to
expect from each book, may possibly help you to understand them. I shall treat yotu as if you. were perfectly
new to the whole; for so I wish you to consider yourself;and English Teacher's Assistant,   2 5.t
because the time and manner in which childrlen usually
read the bible, are very ill-calculated to make them really
acquainted with it; and too many people who have read
it thus, without understanding it in their youth, satisfy
themselves that they know enough of it, and never after.
wards study it with attention when they come to a maturer
age..8. If the feelings of your heart, whilst you read, correspond with those of mine whilst I write, I shall not be
without the advantage of your partial affection, to give
vweight to nmy advice; for, believe me, my heart and eyes
overflow with tenderness, when I tell you how warm and
earnest my prayers are for your happiness here and heregfter.
Of Genesis,
9. I NOW proceed to give you some short sketches of
the matter contained in the different books of the Bible,
and Qf the course in which they ought to be read.
10. The first book, Genesis, contains the most grand,
and, to us, the most iinteresting events, that ever happened
in the universe: The creation of the world, and of man;
the deplorable fall of man, from his first state of excellence
and bliss, to the distressed condition in which we see all
his descendants continue': The sentence of death proinounced on Adam anld on all his race; with the reviving
promise of that deliverance, which has since been wrought
tor us by our blessed Saviour: The account of the early
state of'the world; of the universal deluge: The division
of mankind' into different nations and languages: The
story of Abraham, the founder of the Jewish people,
whose unshaken faith and obedience, under the severest,trial human nature could sustain, obtained such favour in
the sight of God, that he vouchsafed to stile him his friend,
and promised to make of his posterity a great nation; and
hb.at in his seed--that is, in one of his descendants-all
the kingdoms of the earth should be blessed. This, you
will easily see, refers to the Messiah, who was to be the
blessing and deliverance of all nations.
1 1. It is amazing that the Jews, possessing this prophecy
among many others, should have been so blinded by prejudice, as to have expected froum this great p,rsonage, onl5    7T fie Yozng Gt1e7ntman and Lady's Monitor,
a temporal deliverance of their own nation from the sub'l
ection to which they were reduced under the Romans/"
t is equally amazing, that some Christianls should, even
now, confine the blessed effects of his appearance upon
earth, to this or that particuular sect or profession, when
he is so clearly and emnphatically described as the Saviour
of the whole world.
12. The story of Abraham's proceeding to sacirifice his
only son, at the command of God, is affecting in'the highest degree, and sets forth a pattern of unlimited resignation, that every one ought to imitate in those trials of"
obedience under temptation, or of acquiesce nce under afflicting dispensations, which faill to their lot: of this we
may be assured, that our trials will be always proportioned
to the powers alf'orded us. If we have not Abraham's
strength of mind, neither shall we be called upon to lift
the bloody knife aVainst the bosom of an only child; but,
if the almiglhty arin should be lifted uIp against him, we
~inlust be ready to resign him, and all we hold dear, to the.divine will.
13. This action of Abraham.has been censured by some
who do not attend to the distinction between obedience to.a speciah,conmmand, and the detestably cruel sacrifices of
the heathens, vwho sometimes voluntarily, aind without any
divine injunctions, offered up their own children, under
the notion of appeasing -the ang'er of their gods. An absolutecommand from God hirmsel~-as in the case of Abraham---entirely alters the mornal nature of the action; sinLCt
he, and he only; has a perfect e:ight over the lives of his
creatures, and may appoint whom he will, either angel
or man, to be his instrument of destruction.
14. That it was really the voice ofi God which prolounced the command, and not a delusion, might be made
certain to Abraham's mind, by means we do not comprehend, but which we know to be within the power of him
who made our souls as well as bodies, and who can coen
-trotul and direct every faculty of the human mind: and
we may be assured, that if he was pleased to reveal himseif so miraculously, he would not leave a possibility of
doubting whether it was a real or an imaginary revelation: thus the sacrifice of Abrahiam appears to be clear
of all super,,ition,  cj reiemnins the noblest instance ofet,d.English TcacicJe's Assistant.
~rel!ious faith and submission, that  as e givenr by a
nme'iie mna: we cannot wonder tha-t the blessings bestowed!1 h~im for it, should have been extended to his posterity.
1 5. This book proceeds with the history of Isaac,
which becomes very interesting to us, fiorn the touchmliln
scene I have mlentioned-and, still mdore so, if we co-n
sider him'as t1Ahe type of our Saviour: it recounts his maarriapge with Rebecca--the, birth and history of his t1-wo sons,
Jacob,1 the lathier of the twelve tribes, and Esau, the father
of the E-domites,or Idumeans-the ex-quisitively atTecting
story of Joseph and his brethren--and of his transplantilig the Israelites into Egynpt, who there multiplied to a
great nation.

labours for the public good have endeared-their memory
to all ages.
qf,Leviticus, a- nzbers and Dzlterono;ny.
21. THE next book is Leviticus, which contains little
besides the laws for the peculiar ritual observance of the
jews, and therefore alffrds no great instruction to us now;
you may pass it over entirely; and for the same reason
you may omit the first eight chapters of Numnbers. The
rest of Numbers is chiefly a continuation of the history,
witl some rittial laws.
22. In Deuteronomy, Moses makes a recapitulation of
the foregoing history, with zealous exhortations to the
people, faithfully to worship and obey that God who had
worked such amrazing wonders for themn: he promises
them the noblest tempnoral blessings, if they prove obeglient, and adds the most awful and striking denunciations
against them, if they rebel, or forsake the true God.
23. I have before observed, that the sanctions of the
Mlosaic law, were temporal rewards and punishmelnts  
those of the New Testament are eternal. These last, as
~e~y eq  ~o ijaitOly more forcible than the first, were re.and E~isli,3h Teac/ler's Assistant.  2',t
served for the last, bes' g'ift to mankind--and were reveal.
ed by the- Messiah, in tile fullest and clearest manner.
Ioses, i, thls book, directs the method in which the Is-.raelites were to deal  P'ith the seven nations, wlhomn they
werle appointed to pll ish for their profrigacy aznd idolatry; andd vwhose land they were to possess, when they had
driven out the old inhabitants.: -e gives them excellent
laws, civil as- well as religious, which were after the standing1 municipal laws- of that paeople. This -boolk conclud
with Moses' song and death.
2. T-HE book of Joshua contains the conquests of tha
Israelites over the seven nations, and tlhleir establishmelnt
in the promised land. Their treatnment df these conquered nations must appear to you very cTruel and unjulst- if
you consider it as their own act, unauthoised by a positive
command'; but they had the most absolute injunctions nIot
to spare these corruptpeople--"  to make no covenaant withl
" them, nor shew mercy to tihem, but utterly to destlroy' them:"---7nd the reasson is given, " lest they' should
" tarn.away the Israelites fo-rom following the Lord, that
" they mnight serve other gods."  The children of Israel
are to be considered as instruments in the hand of the
Lord, to,punish those whosello idolatry and wickedness had
deservedly brought destruction on them: this example,
therefore, cannot be pleaded in behalf of cruelty, or bring
any imputation on the character of the Jews.
25. WVith regard to otner cities, which did not belong
to these seven nations, they were directed to deal with
them, according to the comnmon law of arms at that.time.
If the city submitted, it becanme tributary, and the people
were spaed; if it resisted, the men were  to be slain, but
the womlen and children saved.
26. Yet, though the crime of cruelty cannot be, justly
laid to their charge on this occasion, you will obse.ve ill
the course of their history, many things recorded of thcn
very different from whvt-at you would expect from the chosen
people of God, if you supposed tlhem selectedl on account
of their.own Merit; their mer; thei-national character was by no
eans -amiable; and wve are repeatedly told, that they
were not chosen for their superior righlteousness-- for62 2   e Young GeOentlernan arnd Lcady's' Monitor,' they were a stiff-necked people, and provoked the Lord
w,ithl their rebellions from tihe day they left Egypt."
4c You have been rebellious against the Lord (says Moses)
"from the day that I knew you."  And he vehemently
-exhorts them, not to flatter themselves thlat their sucesc'as, in any degree, owing to their own mnerits.
27. They were appointed -to be the scourge of--other
nations, 5rwhose crimes rendered thenl fit objects of divine
chastisement. For the sake of righteou.s Abrahan, their
founder, and perhaps for many other wise reasonls undiss
covered to us, they were selected fromn a world over-lun
with idolatiry, to preserve uponlearth the pure worship of
the one only God, and to be honouired with the birth of
the Messiah amo.ngst them. -For this end, they were precluded, by divine command, from mixing with any other
people, and -defended, by agireat number of peculiar rites
and -observances, from falling into the corrupt;orshiip
practised by their neighlbours.
_Of rdes, d Samuel, a-nd IKngs.:28. TIE book of Judges, in i-which you wyill find the
affecting stories of Sampson and Jeptha, carries on the
history fr-om the death of Joshua, about t-wo hundred and
fi-fty years; but, the facts are not told in the tinmes in which
they happened, w1hich makes some confusion; aind it will
be necessary to consult the marginal dates and notes, as
well'as the index, in order to get any clear idea of the
succession of events during that period.
29. The history then proceeds regularly throughthe two
15ooks of Samuel, and those of Kings: nothing can be more
interesting; and entertaining than the reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon: but, after the death of Solomon, when
ten tribes revoltedf from his son Rehoboain, and became a
separate kingdom, you will find some difficulty in underttanding distinctly the histories of the two kingdoms of
Israel and Judah, which are blended together, anld by the
likeness of the names, and other particulars, will be apt

till-tie separation'of the ten tribes:: From that period it
proceeds with the history of the kingdom of Judah alone,
and gives, therefore, a more regular and clear account of
the affairs of Judah, thain the book of Kings. You may
pass over the first boo'k-of Chronicles, and the nine first
chapters of tie second book: but, by all means, read the
rsnmaining chapters, as they will give you mo-re cleail and
distinct ideas of the history of Judah, than that you read
in the second book of King's. The second of Chronicles
ends, like th e second of Kings, with the Babylonishl captivrity.
31. You must purslue the history in the book of Ezra,
which gives the account of the return of somein of the Jews
on the edict of Cyrus, and of the re-building tlhe Lord's
temple.
32. Nehemial carrlies on the history for albout twelve
years, Iwhien he himself-was governor of Jcrusalem, wivth
authority to re-build the walls, &amp;c.
33. The story Of EstLher is prior in time to that of Ezra
and Nehemiah; as you will see by the marginal dates;
howeve-r, as it happened during the seventy years captivity, and is a kind of episode, it may be read in its ownIv
place.
3-4. This is the last of-the canonical books that is roperly historical; and I would therefore advise, that you
pass over what follows, till youl have continued the history
through the Apocryphal Book.s.

was, when at the bar himself, so close and logical a pleader, that with all hile pomp of eloquence in his power, he
never spoke a word too much.
15. It might be borne even here, but it often ascends
the pulpit itself; and the declaimer, in that sacred place,
is frequently so impertinently witty, speaks of tile last day
itself with so many quaint phrases, that there is no man
who understands raillery, but must resolve to sill no more;
nay, you may behold him sometimes in prayer, for a proper delivery of the great truths he is to utter, humlble
himself with a very well turned phrase, and mc;ntion his
unworthiness in a way so very becoming, that the air of
the pretty gentleman is preserved, under the lowliness ot
the preacher.
16. I shall end this with a short letter I wrote the other
day to a very witty man, over-run with the fault I am now
speaking of.' DEAR SIR,
I SPENT some time with you the other day, and must
take the liberty of a friend to tell you of the insuffera-'ble affectation you are guilty of in all you say and do.
17.' When I gave you a hint of it, you asked me whether a man is to be cold to what his fi-iends think of him?'No, but praise is not to be the entertainment of every'moment: he that hopes for it must be able to suspend
the possession of it till proper periods of life, or death'itself. If you would not rather be commended than be
praiseworthy, contemn little merits; and allow no man'to be so free with you, as to praise you to your face.
18.' Your vanity by this means will want its food. At'the same tine your passion for esteem will be more fiully
gratified; men will praise you in their actions: where'you now receive one compliment you will then receive
twenty civilities. Till then you will never have of either,'further thain,'SIR,
I Your huimble servant.'

19. NATURE does nothing in vain; the Creator of the
Universe has appointed every thing to a certain use and
purpose, and determined it to a settled course and sphere264    Tlzhe YToung Geztleinan and aLcdy's A Moinltorg
3t. T'he subject of thIe clispute between Job and his pretended friends, seems to be, whether the Providence of
Godldistributes the rewards and punishments of this life,
in texact proportioni to the merit or dcemerit of each individual. His antagonists -suppose that it does; and thelrefore infer fromlr Job's uncommon calalmities, that, notwithstanding his apparent righteousness, lhe was in reality a
grievous sinner: They aggravate his supl,osed gulilt, by
Ile irneputation of hypocrisy, and call upon him to confess
it, and to acknowledge the justice of his punishment.
37. Job asserts his own innccence and vritue in thle nost
pathetic manner, yet does not presume to acc1use tlhe Suprere Being of injustice. Elihu attempts to,-arbitrate the
matter, by alledging the impossibility that so frail and
ignorant a creature as man should comlprehend the ways
of the Almighty, and therefore condemns the unjust and
cruel inference the three friends had drawn firom the sufferings of Job. He ealso blames Job for the presumption
of acquitting himself of all iniquity, since the best of men
are not pure in the sight of God--but all have somethling
to repent of; and he advises himn to make this use of his
afflictions.
38. At last, by a bold figure of poetry, the SurpremeBeing himself is introduCed, speaking from the whirlwind,
and silencing them all by the moe,st sublime display of his,twn power, magnificence, andl wisdom, and of the corn-'parafive littleress and ig-norance of men.-Th!is, indeed; is,
-the only conclusion of the ar,gument, which could be d I'rawn
at a time when life and immortality were not yet broug"ht
to light: a future retribution is the onlly satisfactory soi,-_

be too conve-rsant. If you have any taste, either for poetry
or devotion, they will be yolur delig'ht, and will afford y3;ou

Such may be found scattered up and cdown almost throughout the. Old Testament. To bear testinlony to him, is the
great and ultinate end for which thie spirit of prophecy was
bestowed on the sacred writers;--btLt, this will appear
more plainly to you whenyou enter on'the study of prophccy, which you are now much too young to undertake.
Of tle Proverbs, Ecclesiaistes, So%lomon's Song, the
_Pr  hecies, and A_pocryp ha.
45. THE Proverbs and Ecclesiastes are rich stores of
wisdom; from which I wish you to adopt such maxims
as mayr be of infinite use, both to your temporal and
eternal interest. But, detached sentences are a kind of
reading-not proper to be continted long at a time; a few
of them, well chosen and'digested, will do you much
inlore service, than to read half a dozen chapters tog,ether:
in this respect, they are directly opposite to the historical
books, which, if not read in continuation, can hardly be
understood, or retained to any purpose.
46. The Song of Solomon is a fine poem-but its mys.
tical ereielnce to reiigion lies too deep for a common understanding-: if you read it, therefore, it 1will be rather a.s
matter o~ curiosity than of edification.
47. NText follow the Prophecies; which, though highly
dceserving the greatest attention and study,. think you had
better omiit for some years, and then read them nwith a good
Expomition, as they are much too difficult for you to under-.t-and without assistance.  Dr. Newton on the prophecies,

pursued, from Nehemiah to tle first book of the Maccabees, in the:.Apocrypha'; takin.g:care to obseirve. the chroniology regularily by referring to the index, which supplies
thle deficiencies of tis history fromn Josephus's Antiquities
of the.Jews. The first Of Maccabees carries on the story
tiil witbin 195 years of our Lortd's circum:cision: the seconcd
book is the sale Ilarrative, written by a diifferent hand, and
does not bring' the history so ibrward as the firi.t; so that it
imay be entirely omitted, u.nless you have the curiosity to
read some partticulars of the heroic constancy of the Jews,
und.er th.e totitures inflicted by their heathlien conquerorsc
witll a few othe~r things not mentioned in the first book.
9.', YouI must then connect the history by the help of
the index, which will,ive' you brief heads of the changes
-tliat happened in the state of the Jevs, fromn this time till
the birth of the Messiah.
50. The other books of the Apocrypha, though not admitted as.of sacred authority, have many things well vworth
your attention; particularly the adirrable book called Ecclesiasticus, and the book of iLisdom. But, in the course
of reading which I advise, these must be omitted till after
you have gone through the Gospels and Acts, that Yyou
may not lose the historical thread.
Of the Newz?estam.ent, _z which is cons,tanynlV to he referredl to as. the Rule azd Directioz of our'moral r conidct.
W 1. WE come n-ow-to that part of scripture, which is
thle nmost implortant of all, and which you must make your
constant study, not only till' you are thoroug-hly acquaintecl
with'it, but all your life long; because, how often soever
repeated, it is inmpossible to read the life and death of our
blessed Saviour, withitout rene-wing and increasingS in our
hearts that love and reverence, and gratitude towards
him, which is so justly dlue fo- all; ie did and suffered for
us! Every word that fell froi.l his lips is niore precious
than all the treasures of the earth; for his  L are the words.
of eternal life!"  They-nmust therefre be laid up in your
heart, and constantly:referred to on all occasions, as the
rule and directions of all your- actions,; particularly those
very comprehensive moral precepts he has graciously left
witli us, which can never fail to direct us arigit, if fairly
and honestly appliaed: such as, "whatsoeyer you wold~68   XThe- Tous.'g Gertl?,n,na ar-ni Lady's Ionitor,
"' that men shoutld do unto you, even so do unto them."'
There is no occasion, great or snall', on which you may
not safely apply this rule for the direction'of your conduct;
anld, whilist your heart honestly adleres to it, you cal n~,ver be guilty of any sorlt of inijustice or unkindness.
52. The two great conlmimadilments, which contain the
summary of our duty to God and man, are no less easily
retained, and made a standard by which to judge our
owvn hearts--" To love the Lord our God, with all our
s hearts, with all our minds, with all our.strength; and: our;neigllbomr (or fe!lcw c'reatule) as ourselves."--
" Love worketh ino ill to his neig-hbour."  Therefore, if
you }have true benevolence, yout will never do any thing
injurious to individuals, or to society.
53. Noiw, all crimes whatever, are (in their remoter consequ ences at least, if not imm-:diatel y aId apparently) injurious to thle society in which wue live. - It is impossible
to love God without dtesziring to please him, and, as fiiar as
we are able.5, to re1sem-ble him: therefore thie love of God
must lead to every virtue in the -highest degree; and, wc
Ymay be sure we do not t?ru,ly love him, if we content ourselves with'avoiding. fligrant sins, and do not strive, in good
earnest, to reach the, egreatest delgree of-perfection we are
capable of. Thus do tiese few wvords direct as to the
highest Christian virtue. Ind&gt;eed, the whole tenor of the
Gospel is to offer us every help, direction, and motive,
tihat can enable us to attain that degree of perfection on
Iwhich depends our eternal good.

54. WiJHAT an example is set beiore us in ouir blessed
master! r-;cow is his whole life, from earliest youth, dedicated to the pursuits of true wisdom, anl d to tlhe pract.ice of
the most exalted virtue! i  heln you see lim, at twelve
years of age, in the temple Lamrongst thle c'octors, bhearing
them, and asking them  questions on the subject of religion, and astonishingS them  all with his understanding
and answers-you will say, perhaps, "'Well mig.ht the
So,n of Godl, even at those years, be far wiser than the
aged; but, can a mortal child emulate such heavenly
wisdom! C-an such apattern be proposed to my imitation?"
-Yes, certainly;---remember that 1e.as- Lequeathedl toet?d cEazglish Teacher'is Assistant.  Sc
you his heav enly wisdom, as far as conlcerns your own
good. He has left you such declarations of his wvill, and
of the consequences of 3otur actions, as you are, even now,
fully able to understand, if you will but attend to them.
If, then, you xvll imitate his zeal for knowledge, if you
wi dieligiht in?'ahinlg- infoirication and improvtenellt, you
may even now become " wise unto salvation.;
55. Unmoved by the r-a.ise he acquired amnongst these
learned mlen, you see hiil nmee lyy retuitl to the subjiection
of a chld, undne: t_ose Iwho appeared to be -his paieu'tso:
tllhough e via.s in -realitk their Lord: you see him return
to live swith thleln, o workl for them, alid to be the joy
and solace of theii lives; till the time came, wVhen he was
to enter on t1hat sceneof public'action, for whiclh his
heanenly Father lhad sent Lhim from hi's own rigllht hand,
to take utpon!him the fo'i 1i of a poor carpenter's son.
56. XVhlat a lesson of hinmility is this, and of obedience
to parents!'--xWhXen, having received the glorious testimony fromI heave\n, of his being the beloved Son ot the most
High, he eiriters-ol his public ministry, what an example
does he give us, of -the most extensive and constant benevolence.-how aie all his hours spent in doing good to the
souls and bodies of men!--not the meanest sinlner is belowlis notice:--To reclaim and save them, he condescends
to converse familiarly witlh the most corrupt as well as
the most abject. All his miracles.are wroughlt to benefit
mankind; not one to punish and afflict them. Instead
of using the almighty power which accompanied himn, to
the purpose of exalting himself, and treading dowrn his
enemies, he makes no other use of it than to heal and to
save.
57. WThen you come to read of hllis sufferings and death,
the ignominy and reproach, the sorrow of mind, and torment of body, which he siiubmitted to-when you consider,
that it was Ill for our sakes-" that by his stripes we are
healed,"-and by his death we-are raised from destruction
to everlasting life--what can I say-that can add any thing
to the sensations you must then feel? No poweroflangiuage
can make the scene more touching than-it appears in the
plain and simple narrations of the Evangelists. The heart
that is ulnlmoved, by it, caii be scarcely' lhumnan; but the
elotions of tenderness and compuiction, which almost270   Th/ e "Yoing Gentleman and Lady's Monitor,
every one feels in reading this account, will 1-be of no o.vail.
unless applied to the true end--uniess it insl)i,es you wi ith
a sincere and warm a{elction towardos vou0i Dblessed  olodwith a firm resolution to obey his commands--to be his
faithful disciple--and ever renounce anidl abhor those silins,which brought mankind under divine condemnation, and'rom wvhich we have beeb redeermed at so Odear a rate.
53. Remember tlihat the title of lChrir;tian, or followel of
Chri-st, implies a more than orda inary' degree'of holiness
-and goodness. As our motives to virtue are stron er than
Ithose -which are acForded to the rest of mankinci, ot' guilt

60. WVHIAT a tremendous scene of the last day does
the gospel place before our eyes!-of that day, whei- you
andi every one of us shall aw;ta;e fromn the pgrave, and beholl the Son of'God, on his giorious triibuiilal attended aby
millions of celestial beings, of whose superior excellence
we can now form no adequate idea--When, in presence
of all mankind, of, t:hose holy angels, and of the great
Judge himself, you mlust give an account of your past lifie.,
and hea; your final doom, friom which thlere can be no appeal, and Nwhich must determine your fate to all eternity:
then think--if for a moment you can bear the thougiht--
what wiill'be the desolation, shame, and anaguish of those
wretched souls, who shall lhear these dreadful vwords---
" Depart fromn me, ye cursed, into e.ve-ilasting fire, pre" pared for the devil aind his angels."-Oh - -I cannotanicl Pngl&amp;h Teacher's Assistant.   27-1
s,ppolPt even the idea of your becoming one of those ulclone, lost creatures! I trust in God's mercy, that you will
make a better use of that knowledge of his wvill, hich he
has vouchsafed you, and of those amiable dispositions he
has given you.'6 1. Let us, therefore, turn friom this horrid, this insupportable view--and rather endeavour to imagine, as far
as is possible, what will be the sensations of y-our sotll, if
you shall hear our heavenly Judge address -you in these
transporting words--" Come thou blessed of my Father,
"inherit.the kingdoln prepared for you from the founda" tion of the world."-Think, what it must be, to become
an object of the esteem and applause--nlot only of all
mankind assembled together-but of all the host ofh eaven,
of our blessedLord himself-nay, of his and our Almiighty
Father:--to find your frail flesh changed in a moment
into a glorious celestial body, endowed with perfect beauty, health, and agility;--to find your soul cleallsed from
all its faults and infirmities; exalted to the purest and
noblest affections; overflowing with divine love and rap.
turous gratitude!-to have your understanding enllightened and refined; your heart enlarged and purified; andl
every power, and disposition of mind and body, adapted
to the highest relish of virtue and happiness!i-Thus accomplished, to be admitted into flhe society of amiable
and happy beings, all united in the most perfect peace
and friendship, all breathing nothing but love to God, and
to each other;--with them to dwell in scenes more de.
lightful than the rlichest imagination can paint-free from
every pain and care, and from all possibility of change or
satiety:-but, above all, to enjoy the more immediate
presence of God himself-to be able to comprehend and
admire his adorable perfections in a high degree, though
still far short of their infinity-to' be conscious of his love
and favour, and to rejoice in the light of his countenance!  
62. But here all imagination fails:--we can form no
idea of that bliss which Imay.be communicated to us by
such a near approach to the source of all beauty and all
good:-we must content ourselves with believing, " that
"it is what mortal eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
" neither hath it entered into the hea'rt of man.to con6
"ceive."  T-he crown of all our joys Will be, to know272   The Youngt Gentlemi2anand. Lady's 1Monitor,
that we are secure of possessing them for ever-what a
transporting idea!
63. Can you reflect on all these things, and not feel the
nost earnest longings after immortality? Do not ail'other
views and desires seem mean and trifling, when compared
with this?-And does not your inmost heart resolve, that
this shall be the chief and constant object of its wishes and
pursuit, throulgh the whole course of your life?
64. If you are not insensible to that desire of happiness
vwhich seems woven into our nature, you cannot surely be
unmoved by the prospect of such a tranlscendanit degree of
it; and that--continued to all eternity-perhaps continually increasing. You cannot but dread the forfeiture of
such an inileritance as the most insupportablie evil!--Re.
memnber thenl-reemem be r the conditions on which alone
it can'be obtainecl. God will not give t6-vice, to carelessness, -or sloth., the prize he has proposed to virtue.
You have every help that can animate your endeavours:
You have vwritten laws to direct you--the example of
Christ and his disciples to encourage you-the most
awnvakening motives to engage you-and you have, besides,
the comfortable promise of constant'assistance from the
Holy.Spirit, if you diligently and sincerely pray for it.
O! let not all this mercy be lost'upon you-but give your
attention to this your only important concern, and accept,
with profound gratitude, the inestimable advantages that
are thus affectionately offered you.
65. Though the four Gospels are each of them a narration of the life, sayings, and death of Christ; yet as they
are not exactly,alike, but some-circumstances and sayings
omitted in one, are recorded in another, you niust make
yourself perfectly master of them all.
66. The Acts of the Holy Apostles, endowed with the
Holy Glhost, and authorised by their Divine Master, come
next in order to be read. Nothing can be more interesting, and edifying, than the history of their actions-of the
piety, zeal, and courage, -with which they preached the
glad tidings of salvation, and of the various exertions of.the wonderful powers conferred on them by the Holy
Spirit for the confirmation of their mission.
Clharacter of St. Paull,
67. THE character, of St. Paul, and his miraculous con-.and Englis.h Teacher,'s Assistant.  273
version, demand your particular attention: most of the
Apostles were men of lowbirth and education; but St. Paul
was a Ronman citizen; that is, he possessed the privileges
annexed to the fr&amp;edom of the city of Rome, which vas
considered as a high distinction i'n those countries that
lhad been conquered by the Romans. He was educated
amongst the most learned sect of the Jews, and by one of
their principal doctors. He was a man of extraordinary
eloquence, as appears not only in hlis writings, but in several speeches in his own -defence, pronounced before
governors and courts of justice, when he was called to
account- for the doctrines he taught.
68. He seems to have been of an uncommonly warm
temper, anid zealous in whatever religion he professed:
his zeal, beflore his conversion, shewed itself in the most
uInj ustifiable actions, by furiously persecuting the innocent
Christians: but, thouLgh his actions were bad, we llay be
sure his intentions were good; otherIwise we should not
have seen a miracle employed to convince him of his mistake, and to bring him into the right way.
69. This example may assure us of the mercy of God
towards mistaken consciences, and oug-ht -to inspire us
with the most enlarged charity and good will towvards those
whose erroneous principles mislead their conduct: instead of resentment and lhatred against their persons, Mwe
ought only to feel an active wish of assisting them to find
the truth, since we klnow not whether, if convinced, they
mhig-lt not prove, like St. Paul, chosen vessels to promote
the honour of God, and of tlrue religion.
70. It is not now my intention to enter with you illto
any of the arguuments for the truth of Christianity, otherwise it woTuld be inpossible wholly to pass over that wlhich
arises from this remarkable c6nversion, and which has
been so admirably illustrated by a nobler writer, whose
tract on this subject is in every body's hands.
Of the Epistles.
71. - NEXT follow the Epistles, which make a very important part of the Newv'Testamelnt; and you cannot be
too much employed in reading them. They contain the
most excellent precepts and admonitions; and are of particular use in explaining more at large several doctrines2"    7The -Yozug Gentleman and Lady's Monitor,
of action, from which, if it in the least deviates, it becomes
tinfit to answer those ends for which it was designed.
20. In like manner it is in the disposition of society: the
civil oeconomy is formed in a chain as well as the natural  
and in either case the breach but of one link puts tile
whole in some disorder. It is, I think, pretty plain, that
most of the absurdity and ridicule we meet witlh in the
world, is generally owing to the impertinent aff-ctatioi of
excelling in characters nlen are not fit for, and folr which
nature never designed them.
21. Every man has one or more qualities which may
make him useful both to himself and others: Nature never fails of pointing them out, and while the infant continues under her guardianship, she brings him on in his
way, and then offers herself for a guide in whlat remains
of the journey; if he proceeds in that course, he can
hardly miscarry: Nature makes good her engagements;
for as she never pro-mises what she is not able to performb
so she nlever fails of performing what she lpromises.
22. But the misfolrtune is, men despise diwhat they may
be Inasters of, and affect what they are not fit for; they
reckon themselves already possessed of what their genius
inclines them to, and so bend all their ambition to excel in
what is (.t of their reach; thus they destroy the use of
their natural talents, in the same manner as covetous men
do their quiet and repose; they can enjoy nlo satisfaction
in what they have, because of the absurcd inclination they
are possessed with for what they have not.
23. Cleanthes had good sense, a great memory, and a
constitution capable of the c:- sest application: in a word,
-there.was no profession in which Clca;zthes might inot have
made a verly good figurle; but this won't satisfy him; he
takes up an unaccountable fondness for the character of a
fine gentleman; all his thotiughts are bent upon this, instead of attending a dissection, frequenting the courts of
justice, or studying the Fathers.
24. Cleanztes rreads plays, dances, dresses, and spends
his time in drawvin, rooms, instead of being a good lawyer, divine, or physician; Clcanthe8 is a down-ri,ht c6xconmb, and will remain to all that knew him a contemptible example of talents misapplied. It is to this affTctajlon lthe n-orld owes its whole race of coxcombs: Nature274   The Youn,g Gentlmaan oazd Lady?s Mohniftr
of Christianity, which we could not so fully comprehend
without them.
72. There are indeed, in the Epistles of St. Paul, many
passages hard to be understood: such in particular are the
first eleven -chapters to the Romans; the greater part of
his Epistles to the Corinthians and' Galatians; and sevre
ral chapters of that to the Hebrews. Instead of perplexing yourself with these more obscure passages of scripture, I would wish you to employ your atteiition cliiefly
on those that are plain; and to judge of the doctrinea
taught in the other parts, by comparing them with what
you find in these. It is through the neglect of this rule,
that many have been. led to draw the most absurd'cdoctrines from the Holy Scriptures.
73. Let me particularly recommend to your carefuli pe-~
rusal, the xii, xiii, xiv, and xv chapters of the Epistle to
the Romans. In the xiv chapter, St. Paul has in view the
4difference between the Jewish and Gentile (or HIeathen)
converts at that time; the former were disposed to look
with 4horror on the latter, for their impiety in not paying
the same regard to the distinctions of days and meats that
they did; and the latter, on the contrary, were inclined to
look with contempt on the former, for their weakness and
superstition.
74. Excellent is the advice which the Apostle gives to
both parties: he exhorts the Jewish converts not to judge
and the Gentiles not to despise; remembering that the
kingdom of Heaven is not nmeat and drink, but righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
75. Endeavour to conform yourself to this advice; to
acquire a temper of universal candour and benevolence;
and learn neither to despise nor condemn any persons on
account of their particular modes of faith and worship:
rememIbering always, that goodness is confined to ao party,
that there are wise and worthy men among all the sects of
Christians, and that to his own master every one must stand
or fall.
76. I will enter no farther into the several points discussed by St. Paul in his various epistles; most ofthem are
too intricate for your understanding at pre'sent, and many
of them beyond my abilities to state clearly. I will only
again recommend to you, to read those passages frequently, which, with so w'ach fervor aQd energy, excite yoluand Eng,lish Teach er's Assistant.   275
to the practice of the most exalted piety and benevolence.
If the effusions of a heart, warmed with the tenderest affection for the whole hulnan race; if precept, warning,
encouragement, example, urged by an eloquence which
such affection only could inspire, are capable of influencing your mind; you cannot fail to find, in such parts of
his epistles--as are adapted to your understanding, the
strongest persuasives to every virtue that can adorn and
inmprove your nature.
The Epistle of St. yamnes.
77. THE Epistle of St. james is entirely practical, and
exceedingly fine; you cannot study it too much. It seems
particularly designed to guard Christians against misunderstanding somne things in St. Paul's writings, which
have been fatally perverted to the encouragement of a dependence on faith alone, without good works. But, the
more rational commentators will tell you, that by the works
of the law, which the Apostle asserts to be incapable of
justifying us, he means not the works of moral righteousness, but the ceremonial works of the Mosaic law; on
which the Jews laid the greatest stress as necessary to salvation. But, St. James tells us, " that if any man among
" us seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but
" deceiveth his own heart, that man's religion is vain;"andthat "pure religion, and undefiled before God and
"the Father, is this, to visit the fatherless ald widow in
"their afllictioh, and to keep himself unspotted from the
" world." Faithl in.Christ, if it produce not these effects)
he declaerethl is dead, or of no power.
Epi8tles of St. Peter, and the first of St. yohn.
78. The Epistles of St. Peter are also fuil of the best
instructions and admonitions, concerning the relative duties of life; anlonlgst which are set forth the duties of
women in general, and of wives in particular. Some part
of his second Epistle is prophetical; warni ng the church
of false teachers ane false doctrines, which undermine morality, and disgrace the cause of Christianity.
79. The first of St. John is written in a highly figurative
stile, which muakes in some parts hard to be understood:
but the spirit of divine love which it so fervently expresses,
renl'ers it highly edifying and delightful.-'That love of
A a2276   The Youn$g Gentleman and Lady's'Monitorg
God and of Man, which this beloved apostle so pathetically
recommends, is in truth the essence of religion, as our
Saviour himself informs us.
Of the Revelations.
8O. The book of Revelations contains a prophetical account of most of the greater events relating to the Christian church, which were to happen from the time of the
writer, St. John, to the end of the world. Many learned
men have taken a great deal of pains to explain it; and
they have done this in many instances very successfully;
but, I think, it is yet too soon for you to study this part of
scripture: some years hence, perlhaps, there may be no -objection to your attempting it, and taking into your hands
the best Exjpositions to assist you in reading such of the
most difficult parts of the New Testament as. you cannot
now be supposed to understand.--May heaven direct you
in studying this sacred volume, and render it the means
of making you wise unto salvation!-May you love and reverence, as it deserves, this blessed and valuable book,
which contains the best rule of life:, the clearest declaration of the will and laws of the Deity, the reviving assurance of favour to true penitants, and the unspeakable joyful tidings of eternal life and happiness to all the truly virtuous, through'Jesu,s Christ, the Saviour and Deliverer of
the world.
True Devotion jproductive of the truzest Pleasure.
I. YOU see that true devotion is not a melancholy sentiment,-that depresses the spirits and excludes the ideaa
of pleasure, which youth is so fond of: on the contrary,
there is nothing so friendly to joy, so productive of true
pleasure, so peculiarly suited to the warmth and innocence
of a youthffil heart. Do not, therefore, think it too soon
to turn your mind to God; but offer himn the first fiuits
of your understanding and affections: and,' be assured,
that the more you increase in love to him, and delight in
hlis laws, the more you will increase in happiness, in excellence, an A honour:--that, in proportion as you improve.
iti true piety, you will become dear and amiable to your
fellow creatures; contented and peaceable in yourselfW
and( qualified to enjoy the best blessings of this life, as.
well'as to iaherit; the gio us's prou.ise of iminwvrtalityand Rnglish Teacher's Assistant.    2)77
2. Thus far I have spoken of the first principles of all
religion: namely, belief in God, worthy notions of his attributes, and suitable affections towards him--which will
naturally excite a sincere desirle of obedience. But, before
you can obey his will, you must know what thai will is;
you must enquire in what manner he has declared it, and
where you may find those laws, which must be the rule of
your actions.
3. The gireat laws of morality are indeed written in our.
hearts, and may be discovered by reason; but our reason
is of slow growth, very unequally dispensed to different
persons; liable to error, and confined within very narrow
limits in all. If, therefore, God has vouchsafed to grant
a particular revelation of his will- --if he has been so unspeakably gracious as to send his Son into the world, to
reclaim mankind from error and wickedness-to' die for
our sins-and to teach us the way to eternal life-surely
it becomes us to receive his precepts with the deepest reverence; to love and prize them above all things; and to
study them constantly, with an earnest desire to.confofrm
our thoughts, our words and actions, to them.

Of Colinmbtus, and the Discovery of America.
1. IT is to the discoveries of the Portuguese in the old
world, that we are indebted for the new, if we may call
the conquest of America an obligation, which proved so
fatal-to its inliabitants, and at tiines'to the conquerors
themselves.
2. This was doubtless the most important event that ever
hlappened on our globe, one half of which had been hitherto strangers to the other.'Whatever had been esteemed
most great or noble before, seemed absorbed in this kiind of
new creation. We still mention, with respectful admiration, the names of the Argonauts, who did not perform the
hundredth part ofwhat was done by the sailors under Gama
and Albuquerque. How many altars wvould have been
raised by the ancients to a Greek who had discovered
America! and yet Bartholomew and Christopher Columbus were not thus rewarded.
3. Coluimbus, struck with the wonderful expeditions of
the Portuguese, imagined that something greater mnight
be done; and from a bare inspection of the map of our
world, concluded that thlere mnust be another which might
be found by sailing always west. He-I had courage equal
to his genius, ol' indeed superior, seeing he had to strug-'-ew-itil the prejudiices of his cotenlpo6iries, and the repulses of several princes to whom he had tendered his
services.
4. Genoa, which was his native country, treated, his
schemes as vislonary, and by that means lost the only opportunity that could have offered of aggrandizing her
power. IHenry VII. king of Elngland, who was too gireedy
of money, to hazard anly on this noble attempt, would not
listen to the proposals made by Columbus's brother; aiid
Columbus himself was rejected by John I1. of Portugal,
whose attention was wholly employed upon the coast of
Africa. He had no prospect of success in applying to
the French, whose marine lay totally neglected, and their

affairs imore confutsed than ever, during the Minority of
Charles VIII. The emperor Maximilian, had neither
ports for shjpping, money to fit out a fleet, nor sufficient
courage-to engage in a scheme of this nature. The
Venetians, indeed, might have undertaken it; but'whether the natural aversion of the Genoese to'these.people9
would not suffer Columbus to apply to the rivals of his
country, or that the Venetians had no idea of any thing
more important than the trade they carried on froni Alexandria,and in the Levant, Columbus at length fixed all
his hopes on the court of Spain.
5. Ferdinand, king of Arragon, and isabella9 queen of
Castile, had by their marriage united all Spain indi-lt one
dominion, excepting onlly the kingdom of Granada, whlich
was still in the possession of the Moors; but which Ferdinand soon after too' friom them. The union of these two
princes had prepared the way for the greatness of Spain,
which was afterwards begun by Columbus; he was however obligedl to under go eight years of incessant application,
before Isabella's court would consent to accept of the inestimable benefit this' great man offered it. The bane of
all great objects is the want of money. The Spanish court
was poor; and the prior, Perez, and two merchlants,
named Pinzono, were obliged to advance seventeen tliousand ducats towards fitting out the arm ament. Columbus
procurecl-a patent fr6rn the court, and at length set sail
froin the port of Palos, in Andalusia, with three ships,
on August 23, in the year 1492.
6. It was not above a month after his departuire from
the Canary Islands, where he had come to an anchor to
-get refr'eshment, when Columbus discovered the first
island in Alnerica; and during this short run, he suffered
more friom thenmurmurings and discontent of the people
of his fleet, than he had done even froim the refusals of the
princes lie had applied to. This island, which he discovereed and named St. Salvador, lies abl-ut a'thousand
leagues from the Canaries. Presently after he likewise
discovered the Lucayan islands, together with those of
Cuba and Hispaniola, now called St. Domingo.
7. Ferdinand and Isabella were in the utmost surprise
to see him returnl at the end of nine months,'with some of
the American natives of Hispaniola, sevweral rarities fromf 4PPEN'DIX.
that country, and a quantity of gold, with which he prae
fented their majesties.
8., The king and queen made himn sit down in their pre$ence, covered like a grandee of Spain, and created him
high admiral and viceroy of the new world. Columbus
was now every where looked upon as an extraordinary
pe6rson sent from heaven. Every one was vying who should
be foremost in assisting him in his undertakings, and embarking under his command. He soon set sail again, with
a fleet of seventeen ships. He now made the discovery of
6sveral other new islands, particularly the Caribees. and
Jamaica. Doubt had been changed into admiration on his
ilrst voyage; in this, admiration was turned into envy.
9. He was admiral and viceroy, and to these titles might
have been added that of the benefactor of Ferdinand and
Isabella. Nevertheless, he was brought home prisoner to
Spain, by judges who had been purposely sent out on
board to observe his conduct. As soon as it was known
that Colupmbus was arrived, the people ran in. shoals to
meet him, asthe guardian genius of Spain. Columlus
was brought from the. ship, and appeared on shore chained hands and feet.
1(. Hehiad been thus treated by the orders of Fonseca,
Bishop of Burgos, the intendant of the expedition, whose
ingratitude was as great as the other's services. Isabella
was ashalmed of what she saw, and did all in her power to
make Columbus amends for the injuries done to him:
however he was not suffered to depart for four years, either because they feared that he would seize upon what
he had discovered for himself, or that they were willing
to have time to observe his behaviour. At length he was
sent on another voyage to the new world;- and now it was
that he discovered the continent, at six degrees distance
from the equator, and saw that part of the coast on which
Carthagepna has been.since built.
1 1. At the time that Columbus first promised a new hemisphere, it was insisted upon that no such hemisphere
could exist; and after he had made the actual discovery of
it, it was pretended that it had been known long before.
12. I shall not mention one Martin Behem, of Nuremberg, who, it is said, went from that city to the Straits
of Magellhn in 1460% with a patent from the Duchess of?4P1PPE ND IX.               283
burgundy, who, as she was not alive at that tinme, could
not issue patents. Nor shall I take notice of the pretended charts-of this Alartin Behem- which are still shewn  
nor of the evident contradictions which discredit this story: but, in short, it was not pretended that Martin Behem
had peopled America; the honour was given to thle Carthaginians, and a book of Aristotle was quoted on the occasion, which he never wrote. Some found out a confornmity between some words in the Caribee and Hebrew
languages, and did not fail to follow so fine an opening.
Othei s were positive that the children of Noah, after settling in Siberia, passed from thence over to Canada on the
ice, ald-that their descendants, afterwards born in Canada,
had gone and peopled Peru.. According to others again,
the Chinese and Japanese sent colonies into America, and
carried over lions vith them for'--their diversion, though
there are no lions eitller in Clhina or Japan.
13. In this nmianner have many learned men argued upon the discoveries made by men of genius. If it should
be asked, how men first ca-me upon the continent of
America? Is it not easily answered,' that they were,placed
there by the same power who causes trees and-grass t,
grow?
1i4. The reply which Columbus made to some of tllose
Who envied--him the high reputation he' had gained, is still
famous. These people pretended that nothing could be
mor'e easy than the discoveries he had made; upon whicihe proposed to them to set an egg upright on one of it.
ends; but when they had tried in vain,.to ddit,. he broke
one end of the egg, and set it upriglht with ease. Tlle
told him any one could do that: How comes it then, replied Columbus, that not one amnong you thought of it?
This story is related of Brunelleschi, who improved architectture at Florence many years before' Columbus wa.
born. Most bon-mots are only the repetition of things
that have been said before.
15. The ashes of Columbus cannot be. affected by the
reputation he gained while living, in having doubled- for
us the works- of the creation. But mankind delight to di
justice to. the illustrious dead, either from a vain hope t
they enhance thereby the merit of the living, or th-a/t the

in her whole drama never drew such a part; she has sometimes made a fool, but a coxcomb is always of a man's
own making, by applying his talents otherwise than nature designed, who ever bears an high resentment for being put out of her course, and never fails of taking revenge
on those that do so.
25. Opposing her tendency in the application of a man's
parts, has the same success as declining firom her course
in the production of vegetables; by the assistance of art
and an hot bed, we may possibly extort an unwilling plant,
or an untimely sallad; but how weak, how tasteless, and
insipid! Just as insipid as the poetry of Valerio.
26. Tal!erio had an universal character, was genteel, had
learning, thought justly, spoke correctly;'twas believed
there was nothing in which Valerio did not excel; and'twas
so far true, that tihere was but one: Va'erio had no genius
for poetry, yet was resolved to be a poet; he writes verbes,
and takes great pains to convince the town, that Valerio
is not that extraordinary person he was taken for.
27. If men would be content to graft upon nature, and
assist her operations, what mighty effects might we expect? T-ully would not stand so much alone ill oratory,
Virgil in poetry, or C,esar in war. To build upon nature;
is laying the foundation upon a rock; every thing disposes
itself into order as it were of course, and the whole
work is half done as soon as tlndertaken. Cicero's genius
inclined hilm to oratory, Virgil's to follow the train of the
muses; they piously obeyed the admonition, and were
rewarded.
28. Had Virgil attended the bar, his modest and ingenuous virtue would surely have made but a very indifferent
figure: and Tully's declamatory inclination would hlave
been as useless in poetry. Nature, if left to herself, lead &gt;
us on in the best course, but will do nothing by cornpulsion and constraint; and if we are not satisfied to go her
way, we are always the greatest-sufferers by it.
29. Wherever nature designs a production, she always
disposes seeds proper for it; which are as absolutely necessary to the formation of any moral or intellectual existence, as they are to the being and growth of plants; and

in the other three'parts of thre world, and Vwhich are of
so great use to us.  Horses, corn ox all kiids, and iron,

cochineal was the principal, and was brought us from this
country. Its use in dying has now made us forget t-he scarlet, which for time immemorial had been the only thing
knowvn for giving a fine- red colour.
24. The importation of cochineal was soon succeeded
by that of indigo, cocoa, vanille, and those woods which
serve for ornament and medicinal purposes, prticularly
the quinquina, or Jesuit's bark, which is the only specific
against intermitting- fevers. Nature has placed this remeiy in the mountains of Peru, whilst she had dispersed the
disease it cured through all the rest of the world. This
new continent likewis; furnished pearls, coloured stones,
ld- diamonds.
2,5. It is certain, that America at present furnishes the
meanest citizen- of Europe with his conveniencie-s and
pleasures.'The gold and silver mines, at their first dis,3
4overy, were of service only to the kings of Spain and. the
ilerchants; the rest of the world was impoverished by
them; for the great multitudes who did not-follow business, found themselves possessed of a very small quantity
fof specie, in comwpairison with the immense sums acciao
miulated by those who had the advantage of the first discoveries. But, by degrees, the great quantity of gold and
siivcr which was sent fromAmerica, was dispersed through.
out all: Europe, and by passing into a number of hands, the
dist`i.utiton is become more equal. The price of com-.modities--.s 1,kewise increased in Europe, in proportiron
to the ilulease of specie;
26. %'o comlprehend how thie treasures of America
passed from the possession of t'he Spaniards into that of
othler nations,. it wliill le sufficient to consider these two
thlings: The'use which Charles V. and Philip II. made of
their mnoney; and the manner in,lwhich other nations acquired a share in the mines of Peru.27r Tfie etipeO  Charles V. who.was alwarys travelIinig, and always at war, necessarily dispersed a great
qllrntity   of that specie whvich he received firom MAexico
and Pernu, throioq GCermna ny anld Italy. W'Vhen he sent
his son Philip iover -to EIinglalnd-,to mrltarry queen Mary,
and take upon himn th.e tile of king of Et;ngland, t'ast prince

chests of silver, in bars, and an hundred horse-loads of
gold and silver coin. The troubles ii slander s, and the
intrigues: of the league in France, cost this Philip, accordiIng to his own confession, above three thousand miliions
of livres of ouir moneTy.
28. The manner in which the;gold and silver of Peru is
distributed anmongst all the people of Europe, and firomi
thence is sent to the East-Indies, is a surprising, thoughl
Nell-.known circumstance.  By a strict lawv cnactd by
Ferdinand and Isabella, and afterwards confirried by,
Charles V. and all the kings-of Spain, all other natiolis
-were not only excltded the entrance i-nto aily of the port;
in Spanish America, but likewise from hiaving the least
share,'directly orL indire.(ctly%;in the,tirade of that part of
the world.  One would lihave imagined,' tiat this law
would have.enabled the Spaniards to subdue all Europe;
and yet Spain sub,lbsts onlly by the continual ~'iola.tion of
this very law. It cani liardly furnish exports fo- America
to the value of fovrl millions.; whereas the rest of E/urope
sonmetimes send over mlerc!handize to the amount of nea.'
fifty millions.
9. TI'lis prodigious trade of'the nations at en-lmlity, ot
at a.lliance with Spain, is carried on by the Spaniards
thlemselves, who are always'ithfuIl in their dealings wvithl
indlividuals,, and always cheating their kiing.  The Spaniards gave no security to foreign merchanlts for the performance of their contracts; a mutual ciedit, WVithout!thich there never could have been: any commrerce, supplies the place of othler obligations.
30. Thle manner in wvhicl- the Spanaarids for a long timne
consigned lthe g-old and silver to foreigners, wthic,h  was
brough lit honie by their g.alleons, wvas still more surprising,
IThe Spaniard, who at Cadiz is pi1"operly factor for the foreigner, deltivered the bullion he received to tlhe care ee'
certain bravroes, called Meteors: these, armed, with pistols

fee, and the foreign merchant was never cheated  T'he
king, who received a duty upon this money at the arrival
of the galleons, was likewise a gainer;. so that properly
speaking, the law only was cheated; a law which would
be absolutely useless-if not eluded, and which, nevertheless,. cannot yet be abrogated, because old prejudices are
always the most difficult to be overcome amongst men.
31..'The greatest instance of the violation of'this law,
and of the fidelity of the Spaniards, was in the year 16849
when war was declared between France and Spain.. His
Catholic majesty ende-avoured to seize upon the effects of
all- tle French in his kingdom;.but he in vain issued edicts
and admonitions,- enquiries and excommunications, not a
single Spanish factor would betray his French correspon-,dent, This fidelity, which does so much honour to the
Spaniish nation, plainly shews, that men only willingly
obey those laws which they themselves have made for the,good of society, and that those which are-th'e mere effects
of a sovereign's will, always meet with opposition.
32. As the discovery of America was- at first the source
of much good to the Spaniards, it afterwvards occasioned
them many and considerable evils, One has' been, the

was, the infecting the world with a disease,- which was before unknown only in -the new world and particularly in
the:island of Hispaniola. Several of.the companions of
Christopher:Columbus returned home:infected with this
contagion, which afterwards spread over Europe, It is
certain that this poison, which taints the -springs of life,
was peculiar to America, as the plague and small-pox,
were:-diseases originally endemial to -the suthern- parts of
Numidia.
33. We are not to believe, that the eating of hiuman
fesh, practised by some. of the. American savages, occasions:this disorder. Th-ere were no cannibals on the island
f: Hispaniola, where it was-most frequent and inveterate;
neither are we to suppose, with' some, that'it proceeded
from too great an excess of sensual pleasures.- Nature had
never punished excesses of this kind with such disorders
in the world; and even to this day, we find that a moninta'y indugence, -hich ha bbeen paised for eight or.IPPENDIX.                    289
ten years,may brling this cruel and shameful scourge upon the chastest union,
34. The great Columbus, after having built several
houses on these islands, and discovered the continent, rec
turned to Spain,. where he enjoyed a reputation unsullied
by rapine or cruelty, and died at Validolid in 1506. But
the Governors of Cuba andHiispaniola, who succeeded
him, being persuaded that these provinces furnished gold,
resolved to make the discovery at the price of the lives
of the inhabitants. -TIn short, whether they thought the natives had conceived an implacable hatred to them, or that
they-were apprlehensive of their superior numbers; or-that
the rage of slaughter when once begun, knows no boundls;
they in the -space of a few years entirely depopulated Hispaniola and Cuba, the former of which contained three
millions of inhabitants, and the latter above six hundred
t.housand.,
35. Bartholomew  de la Cases, bishop of Chiapa, who
was an eye-witness to these desolations, relates that theyv
hunted down the natives with. dogs. These wretched
savages, almost naked and without arms, were pursued
like wild beasts in the forest, devoured alive by dogs, shot
to' deatlh, or surprised and burnt in their- habitations.
36. He further declares, fiom occular testimony, that
they firequently caused. a number of these miserable
wret'ches to be summoned by a priest to come in, and submit to the christiani religion, alnd to the. king of Spain;
and that after this ceremony, which was only-an additionlal act of injustice, they put them-to death without the least
renlorse.-I believe that De la Case  exaggerated in
rmany parts of- his relation; but, allowing him to have
said ten times mole thanis truth, thlere reimains enough
to make us shudder with hoirroI.
37. It may seem surprizing, that this massacre of a whole
race of men, could have been carried on in thle sigh-t, and
under the administration of several relighieuse of the order of
St. Jerome.; for we knoxv that cardinal Ximenes, who was
prime minister-at Castile before the time of Charles V. sent
over four monks of this order, in quality of presidents of
the royal council of the island. I)outlbless they were not
able to resist the torrent, and the hatred of the natives to
their new masters being with just reason become implacable, rendered their destruction ltnhappily necessarye2~9,~. 4PPEA~D IX.

IF all the strength of cities lay in the height of their
ramparts, or-the depth of their, ditches, we should have
great reason to be in fear for that which we have now built.
Are there in reality any walls too higlh to be- scaled by a
val ant enemy? And of what use are ramparts in intestine.divisions?.They may seirve for a defence against:sudden
incursiois firom abroad; but it is by courage and prudence
chiefly, that the invasions of foreign enemies are repelled;
and:by unanimity, sobriety, and justice, that domestic seditions are prevented.  Cities fortified by the strongest
bulwa'rks, have been often seen to yield to force from without, or to tumults firom within. An exact military discipline, and a steady observance of civil polity, are the sUrest
barriers against these evils. Butt there' i still another point
of great importance-to be consideted.- The prosperit'y of
some rising colonies, and the speedy ruin of-others, have
in a- great measure been owing to the form of government.
Was thbere but one manner of ruling states anId cities that
-could make- youhappy, the- choice would'not be difficult;'but I'hlave learnt, that of the various foims of government
among t-he Greeks and Barbarlans, tlhere are ttiree which
are highly extolled by those who have expeienced them;
and yet, that no one in those is in all respects perfect; but
eacl-h of them hIas some innate and inculrable defect. -Chuse
you then in what manner this city shall he governed.' Shall
itcbe by one man? Shall it be by a select number of the
wisest alnong us? or shall the legislative'power be in the
people!? As for me, I shall submit to whatever form of
administration you shall please to establish. As I think

TIIOUGH    I am' not conscious, 0 Romans, of any

gates of Rome, and went away unchastised! The course
of our manners, indeed, and the State of our aftairs, have
long been such, that I had no reason to presage much
good: But could I have imagined that so great an ignominy would have befallen me this year, I,vould by death
or banishment (if all othev meanis had failed) have' avoided the station I am now in. W- hat might Rome then
ihave been taken, if-those men who were at otlr gates

are in the fault, depose us, or punishlus yet more severely. If you are to blame, may neither, God nor man punish your faults! only may you repent. No, Romlans, the
confidence of ouar enemies is not owing to their courage,
or to the belief of your cowardice. They have been too
often vanquished, not to know both themselves and you.

30. As there is no good or bad quality that doeC not
affect both sexes, so it is not to be imagined but the fair
sex must have suffered by an affectation of this nature, at
least as much as the other: the ill effect of it is in none
so conspicuotls as in the two opposite characters of C'elia
and Iras. Cxclia has all the charms of person, togethelr
with an abundant sweetness of nature, lbut wants wit, and
has a very irl voice: Iras is ugly and ungeliteel, butl
has wit and good sense.
31. If C~lia would be silent, her beholders would adore
her; if Iras would talk, her hearers wrould admire her;
but Celia's tongue runs incessantly, while Iras gives herself silent airs and soft languors; so that'tis difficullt to
persuade one's self that Celia has beauty, and Iras wit:
each neglects her own excellence, and is ambitious of the
ether's character: Ir-as would be thought to have as much
beauty as Celia, and Celia as much wit as Iras.
32. The great misfortune of this affectation is, that
men not only lose a good quality, but also contract a
bad one: they not only are unfit for what they wvere designed, but they assign themselves to what they are not
fit for; and instead of making a very good. figure one way,
make a very ridiculous one in another.
33. If Semanthe would have been satisfied with her natural complexion, she might still have been celebrated by
the name of the olive beauty; but Semanthe has taken up
an affectation to white and red, and is now distinguishe(d

34. In a word, could the world be reformed to the obedience of that famed dictate, follow nature, which the oracle of De,'Phos pronounced to Cicer'o when he consulted
what course of studies he should pursue, we should see
almost every man as eminent in his proper sphere as
Tully was in his, and should in a velry short time find impertinence and affectation banished from among the women, and coxcombs and false characters firom among tl-e

vantage of the commonwealth to all other considerations,
favour my pretensions,the Patricians want nothing so much
as an occasion against me. It is, tlerefore, my fixed re.
solutionr to use my best endeavours, that you may not be
disappointed in mle, and that their indirect designs against
me may be defeated.
I have, from my youth, been familiar with toils, and
with dangers. I was faithfiul to your interests, my countrymen, when I served you for no reward, but that of
honour. It is not mny designl to betray you,l now that you
have conferred upon me a- place of profit. You have
committed to my conduct, the war against Jugurtha. The
Patricians are offended at this. But, wlhere would be
thd W_i`sdom  of giving such a command to one of their honourable body? a person of illustrious birth, of ancient
family, of innumerable statues, but--of no experience!
What service would his long line of dead ancestors; or
his multitude of motionless statues, do his country in the
day of battle.? What could such a general do, but, in
his trepidation and inexperience, have recourse to some
inferior commnander, for direction in difficulties to which
he was not himself equal? Thus, your Patrician general
would, in fact,have a general over him; so that the acting
commander.would still be a Plebeian. So true is thlis, my
countrymen, that I have myself known those, who have
been chosen consuls, begin then to read the history of
their own country, of which, till that time, they were
totally ignorarnt: that is, they first obtained the emb
ployment, and then bethought themselves of the qualifiL
cations necessary for the proper discharge of it.
I submit to your juldgment, Romans,-on which side the
advantage lies, when a comparison-is made between Patrician haughtiness and Plebeian experience. The very actions, which they have only read, I have partly seen, and
partly myself atcheived. What they know by reading,
I know by action. They are pleased to slight my mean
birth. I despise their mean characters. Want of birth
and fortune is the objection against me: want of personal
merit against them. But are not all men of the same species-? W What can make a difference between one man and
another but the endowments of the mind? For my part, I.hall always look upon the bravest man as the noblest man.APP2XD IX.                    29,5

b:1EMOSTHENES to tile ATI-IENIMAXS,
W.~HEN I compare, Athenians, the speeches of sorrme
amongst us, with their actions, I am at a loss to i'cioncile
what I' see, with what I hear. Their protestations are full
of zeal against the public enemy; but their measures are
so inconsistent that all their professions become suspected. By confounding you with a xv,ariety of projects, they
perplex your resolutions, andt lead you friom executinSg
-what is in your powel, by engaging you in schemes not
reducible to practice.'Tis true, there was a time, when we were powerful
enough, not only to defeird our own borders, and protect
our allies, but even to invadce Philip in his own dominions,
Yes, Athenians, there was such a juncture; I remember
it well. But, by nleglect of proper, opportunities, we are
no longer in a situation to be invaders: it will be well for
us, if we can procure fo'i our own defeice, and our allies.
Never. did any conjuncture require so much prudence as
this. -However, I should not despair of seasonable remedies, hbad I the art to ptevail -witli you to be unanimous in
ighit measures. The- opportunities, which have so often
escaped us have not been lost, througl ignorance, or want
of judgment; but through negligence or trieachery.--If I
assume, at this time, more than ordinary liberty of speech~
I conjure you to suffer,: patiently, those truths, which have:
no other end, but your own good. You have too manyreasons to be sensible how mtch you have suffered, by
hearkening to sycophants, I shall, therefore, be plain, in.
laying before you the grounds of past miscarriages, in orI
der to correct you in your future conduct.
You may remember, it is not above three or four yearM
since we had the news of Philip's laying siege to the for:tAess of Juno, in Thrace4 It wVas, as I think, in Octobert
we' receivel this intelligence, We voted an immediate
supply of threescore talentsi forty nmen of War were ordered to sea: and so zealous we were, that preferring the
necessities of state to our very laws, our citizens above
the age of five and forty years, were commanded to serve.
What followed?-A whole year was spent idly, without
any thing done; and it was- but the third month of the fok

Ceres, that Charedemus set sail) furnished with no more

not see them  multiply, every day, as they do, aind upo'x
every occasion, with so little effect: nor would Philip bL
in a condition to braxve and affront uis in this manner.--
Proceed, then, Athenians, to support your deliberationls
with vigour. Y6Ou have heads capa.ble of advising what is
best; you have judgment and experience, to discern whvat
is riglit; and you have power and opportunity to execute
wYhat yon determine.'What time so p'-oper for action L
What occasion so happy?   And when can you hope for,such another, if this be neglected? HIas not Philip, contrary to all treaties, iinsullted you in Thrace? I)oes lie not,

you have solemnly swoin to protect?  Is he not an inplacable enemy? a faithless ally? the usrirper of proviulces,'o which he has no title nor pretence? a stranger, a
barbarian, a tyrant? and indeed, what is he not?
Observe, I beseech you, men of At hens, how diffeirint
your.conduct appears froln the practices of your ancestors. They were friends to, truth and plain dealing, and
detested flattery and servile compliance. By unanimous
consent they continued arbiters of all Greece for the spalceI.93 8.PPE.ND, IX.

fictories and by theier noble exploits, transnmitted to posterity an- immortal memory of their virtue, superior to the
ireach 6f malice and detraction. It is to them wve owe that
great number of public edifices, by which the city of
Athens exceeds all the rest of the -'orld, in beatuty and
magnificence. It is to them we owe so many stately ternples, so richly embellished; but, above all, adorned with
the spoils of vanquished enemies-But, visit their own
private habitations; visit the houses of Aristides, aIiliti~ades, or any other of'those patriots of antiquity; you will
find nothing, not the least markofornament, to distinguish
thlem from their neigh-Ibours. They took palt in the governimcnt, not to enrich themselves, but the public; they
had no schemes or amnbitioii,'but for the p ublic nor
knew any interest, but the public. It was by a close alnd
steady applicationa-to the general good of their country;
by an exemplary piety toward the immortal gods; by a
strict faith, and religious honesty, betwixt man and man  
and a- modelation, always uniform, and of apiece; they
established that reputation, which remlains to this day, and
will last to utmost posterity.
Such, 0 men of Athens! were your ancestors; so glorious in the eye of the world; so bountifiul and munificent
to their country; so sparing, so- modest, so self-denying
to themselves. WVhat resemblance can we find in the present generation, of these great men? At a tinie, when
your- ancient competitors have left you a clear stage;
when-the Lacedemonians are disabled; the Thebans employed in troubles of their own;: when no other state
whatever is in a condition to rival or molest you: in short,
when you are at full liberty; when you- have the opportunity and the- power to become once more the sole'arbiters of Greece; you permit, patiently, whole provinces
to be arrested from you; you lavish the public money to
scandalous and obscure uses; you suffer your allie3 to
perish in time of peace, whom you preserved in time of
war; and, to sum up all, you yourselves, by your mercenary court; and servile resignation to the will and pleCtAIPPENDLI,o                  299
sure of designing, insidious leaders, abet, encourage, and
strengthen the most dangerous and formidable of yo-ur
enemies. Yes, Athenians, I repeat-it, you yourselV-es are
the contrivers of your own ruin. Lives there a man wko
has confidence enough to deny it? let him arise, and assig'n,
if he can, any other cause of the siuccess and prosperity of
Philip. " But," you reply, "6 what Athens may have lost
"in reputation abroad,she has gained in splendor at homee
W "Vas there ever a greater appearance of prosperity? a
" greater face of plenty? Is not the city enlarged? Are
cnot the streets better paved? hotuses repaired and beau"tiried?"-Away with such trifles! Shall I be plaid with
counters? -An old square new vamiped up! a fobuntain!
an aquleduct! Are these acquisitions to brag of? Cast
your eye upon the magistrate, under whose ministry you
boast these precious improvements. Behold the despica.
ble creature, raised, all at once, from dirt to opulence;
from the lowest obscurity to the highest hollours. Have
not sonme of these upstarts built private houses and seats,
vyimg  with the most sumptuous of outl public palaces?
And how have their fortunes and their power increased.
but as the commonwealth has been ruinred and impoverished!
To what are-we to impute these disorders? and to what
cause assign Ahe decay of a state, so poiverful and flourishing in past time?-The reason is plain. The servant is
now become the master. The magistrate w~as then subservient to the people: punishmenlts:and rewards were
properties of the people: all honours, dignities, and preferments were disposed by the voice and favouir of the
people. But the magistrate, now, hbas usurped the right
of the people,, and exercises an arbitrary authority over
his ancient andinatural lord. You miserable people i the
mean  w hile, without money, without fiiends; from being the ruler, are becoime the servant; from being the
master, the dependant: happy that these governors, into
whose hands you have thus resigned your owin power,
are so good, and so gracious, as to continue your poor
allowvance to see plays.
Believe me,Athenians, if recovering from this lethargy,
you would assume the ancient freedom and spirit of youlr
ftlihers; if you would be your ownl soldie,rs, anid you'0, oQn

"peace, accepted as pay in time of war. Is it thus we
" are to undeirstand you?"-Yes, Athenians,'tis my plain
meaning. I would make it a standing rule, that no person, great -or li.ttle, should be the better for the public mo-'ey,-who should grudclge to employ it for the public service.
_Are we in- peace? the public is -charged wvith youlr subsistence. Are we in wa1r5 or under a necessity, as at this
time, to enter into a war'? let your gratitude oblige yu to
accept, as pay, in defence of your benrefactors, what you

THE PERFECT SPEAKER.
IMAGINE to yourselves a Demosthenes addressing
the most illustrious assembly in the--world, upoil a point
whereon the fate of the most illustrious of nations depended.--How awful such a meeting! How vast the subject! Is man possessed of talents adequate to the great
oscaQ1on  Adequate-yes, superior.  By the power ofv' PPiN J  T.                  30 I
hils eloquence, the aug-ustness of thb assembly is lost in
the dignity of-the orator; and thle importa ce of the subject for a while superceded by the adm-iration of his talents.
With whiat strength of ar.g'hment, with what powers of the
fancy, with what emotions of the heart, does he assault
and subjugate the whole man, and, at once, captivate his
reason, his irnagination,'and his passions!-To eftiect this,
must be the utmost effort of the imost improved s;tate of
huma1n nature. Not a faculty that he possesses, is here
ulaemployed: not a faculty that he possesses, but is here
exerted to its highest pitch. All hlis internal power,s are
at work: all his external--testify their energies. Within,
the memory, the fancy, the judgment, the p.assions are
all busy.: iithout, every muscle, every nerve is exerted  
not a feature, fnot a limb, but speaks. The organs of the
body attuned to the exertions of the mind, through the
kindred t rgans of the hearers, instantaneously, ancld, as it
were, with an electrical spirit, vibrate those energies fi-rom
soul to soul.  T Notwtuithstaniding the diversity of minids in
such a mul'titude, by the lightning of eloquence, they are

QUINTILLIAN says, th-,t he has included almost all
the duty of scholars in this one pliece of advice which he
gives them, to love those who teachL them-, as they love the
-science which they learn of them; and to look upon them
as fathe,rs, from whom they derive not th-le life of' the body,
but that instruction which is in a nmanmnter the life of tfhe
soul- Indeed'this sentiment of afTection-aiti d r'espect suftfices to make them apt to learn during the time of their
studies, and ful-l of gratitude all the rest ofthei,r lives. It
seems to me to include a great part of what is to Ibe expected from them.
Docility, which consists in su'miiitting to directions,  in
readily re ivin V the instructi,o s of i l eir masters1 and r'-;ducing them to practice, is properly the virtue of sclolars,
as that of masters is to teach well. The one can do nothing without the other; anld as it is not sufficienit for a
labourer to sow the seed, uliless the earth, after having
opened-its bosom to. receive it, in a manner hatches,warms,
and moistens it; so likewise the whole fiuit of instruction
depends upon a good:-correspondence between the masters and the scholars.
Gratitude for those who have laboured in our education, is the character of an honest man, and the mark of
a good heart. Who is there among us,: says Cicero, that
has been instructed with any care, that is not highly delighted with the sight, or even the bare rememnbrance of
his preceptors, masters, and the place where he was
taught and brought up? Seineca exhorts young men to
preserve always a great respect for their masters, to whose
care they are indebted for the' amendment of tl:-ir,Ifaults,
and for having imbibed seitiments of honour and probity.
Their exactness and severity displease;sometimes, at an
ag'e when we are not in a condition to judge of the, obligations iwe owe to themn; but when years have ripened
our understandingp and judgm,ent, we then discern that
what made us dislike them, I inean admonitions, repri.
mands, aind a severe exactness in restraining the passions
of an imprudent and inconsiderate age, -is expressly the
very. tlhing- which should make us esteem and love them.
Thus We see that Marcus Aurelius, one of the wisest
and most illustrious emperors that Rome ever had, thanked the gods for two thin gs especially-for his having had
excellent tutors himself, and that lie -had found the like
for his children.
Quintillian, after havin'g noted the different characters
of the mind in childrlen, draws, in a few words, the image
of what he judged to be aperfect scholar/; and certainly it
is a very amiable one: " For my part,'" Says, le, l   I like a' child who is encouraged by commendation, is animated
"( by a sense of glory, and iweaeps when he-is outdone. A
- noble emulation will always keep him in exercise, a re" primand wili- touch him to the quick, and honour. will''serve instead of a spur. WTe need not fear that such a' scholar will ever give him self up to sullenness."  1V'/zi

How great a value soever Quintillian sets upon the talenits of the mind, lie esteems those of the heart far beyond them, and looks upon the others as of no value without them. In:the same chapter fiom whence I took the
prieceding words, he declares, he should lever hlave a good
opinion of a child, who placed his study in occasioning
laughter, by imlicking the behaviour, mien, and faults of
others; aind he presently gives an admirable reason -for it:' A child," says he, "4 cannot be truly ingenuous, in my
"r opinion, unless he be good and i,irtuous; otherwise, I
" shiould rathe} choose to have him dull and heavy, than
"c of a bad disposition.'"  J2o?? dcabit 81:cm bonoe indotz'-i,% qgui

He displays to us all these taIcnts in the eldest of hbis
twlO hildren, whose character he drawvs, and whose death
he laments-in so eloquent and pathetic a strain, in the
beautiful pr,eface to his sixth book. I shall beg leave to/
insert here a small extrlact of it, whici will not be useless
to the boys, as they wvill find it a model wvhichi suits well
with their age and condition.
After having mentioned his younger son, who died at
five years old, and described theegraces-and beauties of
his countenance, the prettiness of his expression, the vivacity of his understanding, wnviich began to shine througk
the veil of childhood: " I had still left lle," says he, " my

Go~d Huzmozir and Nature.
1. A MAN advanced in y'ears that thinks fit to look
back upon his former life, and calls that only life which
was passed wvith satisfaction and enjoyment, excluding
all parts whichl were not pleasant to him, will find himself
very young, if not in his infancy. Sickness, ill-humour,
and idleness, will have robbdd him of a great share of that
space we ordinarily call our life.
2. It is therefore the duty of every man that would be
true to himself!, to obtain, if possible, a disposi'ion to be
pleased, and place himself in a constant aptitude fc,. the
satisfaction of hlis being. Instead of this, you lhardly see
a man who is not uneasy in proportion to his advancement
in the arts of life.
3. An afiected delicacy is the common improvement
we meet with in these who pretend to be refinled above
others: they do not aim at true pleasure theLmselves, but
turn their thoughts upon observing the false pleasures of
other men. Such people are valetudinarians in society,
and they should no more come into companly than a sick
man should come into the air.
4. If a man is too weak to bear what Is a refieshment

any one in Sir Ro3ger's company coimplains he is out of order, he immediately calls for some posset drink for him; for
which reason that sort of people, who are everi bewailing
their constitutions in other places, are the cheerfulest imaginable when he is present.
5. It is a wonderful thing that so many, and they not
reckoned alsurd, shall entertain those with whom they
converse, by giving them the history of their pains and
aches; and imagine such narrations their quota of the
conversation. This is, of all others, the.meanest help to
discourse, and a man must not tl-irk at all, or think him~elf very insignificant, when he finds an account of his4S* O,.4                       I I X,

PHILOSOPHIIC SOLITUDE, c.
LET ardent heroes feek renown in arms,
Pant after fame, and rufi to wvar's alarms;
T'o iflining palaces let fools refort,
And dunces cringe to be efteem'cd at court:
MIine be the plei fure of a rural life,
Froni noife remote, and ignorant of ftife;
Far from the painted belle, and white-glov'd beau,
The lawlefs mafqueradelm a;nd midlnight'lhovw;
From ladies, lap-dogs, courtiers, garters, stars,
FoP's, fiddlers, tyrants, emperors, and czars.
Full in the-centre of ibme fiiady grove,
By nature form'd for folitudT and love;
Otn banks array'd with ever-bloomingc-flow rs,
Near beaut'ous landfcapes, or by rofeate bow'rs,.My neat, but fimple manfion I would raife,
Unlike the fumptuous domes of modern days;
Devoid of pomp, with rural plainnefs form'd,
WVith favage game, and glolfy fhells adorn'd.
No cofily furniture ihould grace my ball;
But curling vines afcend againit the: wall,
lVhofe pliant branches fionud luxuriant twine,
WVhile purple clIRers fwell'd with future wiine
To flake my tliirft a liquid lapfe diflill,
From craggy rocks, and fpread a liimpid rill.

And loomy yews e xtend the ishady,ow;

To herbag'd vales, gay lawns, and ftilnny hills.'Welcome ye Ihades! all hail, ye vernal bloolms
Ye bow'ry thickets, and prophetic glooms!
Ye forefts hail! ye folitary woods!
Love-whifpering groves and filver-streaming floods t
Ye meads, thar aromatic sweets exhale!
Ye birds, and all ye sylvan beauties hail!
Oh how I long with you to fpend my days,
Invoke the mufe, and try the rural lays!
No trulnmpets there ivith martial clangor found,
No proirate heroes ftrew the crimfon'd groun d  
No groves of lances glitier in the air,
Ntor thund'ring drums provoke the fanguine war
But white.rob'd peace, and univerfal love

Breeze o'er the lawn, or murmur through the vales.'The flow'ry tribes in gay confofion bloom,

On bloffoms bloffoms, frvits on fsuits arife,

I3'126    The Yboung Gentlezman and Lady',s Monitor,
head ache answered by another asking, what news in the
last mail?
6. Mutual good humour is a dress we ought to appear
in wherever *we meet, and we should make no mention
of what concerns ourselves, without it be of mnatte's
wherein our friends oug!ht to rejoice: but indeed there
are crowds of people who put themselves in no mnethod
of pleasing themselves or others; such are those whom
we usuallv call indolent persons.
7. Indoience is, metllinks, an intermediate state between
pleasure and pain, and very much unbecoming any part of
our life after we are out of the nurse's arms. Such an
aversion to I-tbour creates a constant weariness, and one
would think should make existence itself a burden.
8. The indolent man descends from the dignity of his
nature, and nmakes that being which was rational, merely
vegetative; his life consists only in the mere increase and
decay of a body, which, wvith relation to the rest of the
world, might as well have been uninformed, as the habitation of a reasonable mind.
9. Of this kindi is the life of that extraordinary couple,
Inarrj Tersett and his lady. Heirry was, in the days of his
celibacy, one of those pert creatures who have much vivacity and little understanding; Mrs. Rebecca Quickly, whom
he married, had all that the fire of youth and a lively manner could do towards making an agreeable woman.
10. These two people of seeming merit fell into each
other's arms; and passion being sated, and no reason or
good sense in either to stcceed it, their life is now at a
stand; their meals are insipid, and time tedious; their
fortune has placed them above care, and their loss of taste
reduced them below diversion.
11. When we talk of these as instances of inexistence,
we do not mean, that in order to live it is necessary we
should always be in jovial crews, or crowned with chaplets
of roses, as the merry fellows among the ancients are described; but it is intenlded by considering these contraries to
pleasure, indolence and too much delicacy, to shew that it
is prudent to preserve a disposition in ourselves, to receive
a certain delight in all we hear antdsee.
12. This portable quality of good-humour seasons all
the parts and occurrences we mect with, in such a manner,81f 44                  ATAEA     hXnin.Tie

13. Va,ri.',s has this quality to the highest perfection,
and communicates it wherever he appears: the sad, the
merry, the severe, -the melancholy, sllew a new clleerful*ness when he comes amongst them. At the same time
no one can repeat any thing that Varilas has ever said that
deserves repetition; but the man has that innate goodness
of temper, that he is wvelcome to every body, because every
man thinks he is so to hinm.

it all happened by his being there. I thought it was whimsically said of a gentleman,'That if Varilis had wit, it
would be the best wif in the world. It is certain when
a well corrected lively imagination and good-breeding alre
adided to a svweet disposition, they (qualify it to be one of
the greatest blessings, as well as pleasures of life.
15. Men would come into company x.ith ten times the
pleasure they do, if they were sure of hearing nothing
which should shock them, as well as expected what would
please them. XVhen we know every person that is spoken
of is represented by one who has no ill-will, and every
thing that is mentioned described by one that is apt to set
it in the best light, the entertainment must be delicate,
because the cook has nothing bought to his hand, but
wlhat is the most excellent in its kind.
16. Beautiful pictures are the entertainments of pure
minds, and deformities of the corrupted. It is a degree
towards the life of angels, when we enjoy conversation
whllerein there is nothing present but in its excellence; and
a degree towards that of dxelons, wherein nothing is
shewn but in its degeneracy.

For he had been a foldier in his youth',
And fought in famous battles, when the peers.

And all the live long day, difcourfe of war.
To help my fancy, in the fmooth green turf

Loaded with wealtlh and honours bravely won,
A rude and boift'rous captain of the fea
Faften'd a quarrel on hin. - Fierce they foughtt;
The firanger fell, and with his dying breatlih,
Declar'd his name and lineage! Mighty God!
The foldier cry'd, my brother! Oh! my brother'
Tlhey exchang'd forgiveiefs;
And happy, in my mind, was he that died;
For many deaths has the furvivor fuffer'd,
In the wild defart on a rock he fits,
Or on fome namelefs ftream's untrodden banks,
And ruminates all day his dreadful fate.
At times, alas! not in his perfect mind!
Hold's dialogue's with his lov'd brother's ghoft;
And oft each inight forfakes his fullen couch,
To make fad orifons for him he flew.
BAUCIS AND PHILEMON.
IN ancient times, as ftory tells,
The faints would often leave their cells9
And ftroll about; but hide their quality,
To try good people's hofpitality.
It happened, on- a winter night,
As authors on the legend write,
T'wo brother hermits, faints by trade,
T1aking their tour in mafquerade,
Difguis'd in tattered habits, went'i'o t finall village down in Kent;
WThere, in the firoller's canting ftrain,
They begg'd from door to door, in vain;
Tri'd every tone might pity win,
Blut not a foul woulld let them iin.
Ou1r wandering faints, in woeful fdate,
Treated at this ungodly rate,
Having through all the village pafs'd,
T'o a finall cottage came at lart,'Where dwelt a -good old honei t yoelman,

of discourse, their debates are taken up chiefly with fornA
and general positions; nay, if we come into a more contracted assembly of men and women, the talk generally
runs upon the weather, fashions, news, and the like public topics.
3. In proportion as conversation gets into clubs and
knots of friends, it descends into particulars, and grows
more free and communicative; but the most open, instructive, and unreserved discour;se, is that which nasses
between two persons who are familiar and intimate
friends.
4. On these occasions, a man gives a loose to every
passion, and every thought that is uppermost discovers
his most retired opinions of persons and things, tries the
beauty and strength of his sentiments, and exposes his
whole soul to the examination of his friend.
5. Tully was the first who observed, that friendship improves happiness and abates misery, by the doubling of
our joy and dividing of our grief; a thought in which he
hath been followed by all the essayers upon friendship,
that have written since his time. Sir Francis sacon has
finally described other advantages, or, as he calls them,
fruits of friendship; and indeed there is no subject of
morality which has been better handled and more exhausted than this.
6. Among the several fine things which have been spoken of, I shall beg leave to quote zfme out of a very ancient author, whose book would be regarded by our modern
wits as one of the most shining tracts of morality that
is extant, if it appeared under the name of a Cowyicius or of any celebrated Grecian philosopher; I mean
the little Apocryphal Treatise, entitled the VWisdom of
the Son of Sirach.
7. How finely has he described the art of making friends,
by an obliging and affable behaviour! And laid down that
precept which a late excellent author has delivered as his
own, "' That we should have many well-wishers, but few
" friends."  Sweet langnuage will multiply friends; a(nd a
fair-speaking tongue will increase kind greetings. Be in
peace with many, nevertheless have but one counsellor
of a thousand.

of our friends! And Xwith what strokes of nature (I could
almost say of humour) has he described the behaviour of a
treacherous and self-interested friencl--" If thou wouldest
" get a friend, prove him first, and be not hasty to credit
" him: for some man is a friend for his own occasion,
" and will not abide in the day of thy trouble.
9. "And there is a friend, who being turned to enmity
" and strife, will discover thy reproach."  Again, "Some
" fiiend is a companion at the table, and will not continue
" in the day of thy affliction: but in thy prosperity he
" will be as thyself, and will be bold over thy servants.
"If thou be brought low, he will be against thee, and hide
" himself firom thy face."
10. What can be more strong and pointed than the following verse? "Separate thyself from thine enemies, and
" take heed of thy friends." In the next words he particularizes one of those fruits of friendship which is described at length by the two famous authors above mentioned, and falls into a general eulogium of friendship, which
is very just as well as very sublime.
11. " A faithful firiend is a strong defence; and he that
"hath found such a one, hath found a treasure. Nothing
" doth countervail a faithful friend, and his excellence is
"invaluable. A faithful friend is the medicine of life;
" and they that fear the Lord, shall find him.  WVhoso
"feareth the Lord, shall direct his friendship aright; for
" as he is, so shall his neighbour (that is, his fiiend) be
" also."
12. I do not remember to have met with any saying
that has pleased me more than that of a friend's being the
medicine of life, to express the efficacy of friendship in
healing the pains and anguish which naturally cleave to
our existence in this Nworld; and am wonderfully pleased
with the turn in the last sentence, That a virtuous man
shall, as a blessing, meet with a friend who is as virtuous
as himself.
13. There is another saying in the same author, which
would have been very much admired in an heathen writer:
"Forsgke not an old friend, for the new is not comparable
" to him: a new friend is as new wine; when it is old
" thou shalt drink it with pleasure."

SECTIONT.
On the S7eak-ing of pS&gt;eeches at Sch-ools.
ELOCU TION lhas, for some years past, been an object of attention in the most respectable schools in this
country. A laudable ambition of instructing youtlh in
the pronunciation and delivery of their native language,
has mnade English speeches a very conspicuous part of those
exhibitions of oratory which dlo them so much credit.
This attention -to English pron-uiciation has induced several ingenious men to compile Exercises in Elocution
for the i_se of schools, which have answered very useful
purposes; but none, so far as I have seen, have attempted to give us a regullar system of ges-ture suited to the
wants and capacities of school-boys. IMr. Burgh, in his
Art of Speaking, has given us a system of the passions,
and hlas shewn us lhow they appear in the countenance,
and operate on the body;- but'this system,- however usefut;to people of riper years, is too clelicate aind comnpli'cated to be taught in schlools. Indeed, the exact adaptation of the action to the world, and the word to the action,
as Shakespear calls it, is the most difficult part of delivery, and tlerefore cain never be taught perfectly to children-; to say nothinlg of distracting their attention with
twvo difficult things at the same time. But that boys
should stand motionless, while they are pronouncing the
nost impassioned language, is extremely absurd and
unnatural; and that they should sprawl inlto an aukwar'd,
u'ngain, and desultory actiona, is still lmore offensive and
disgusting., Wlhat then remains, -but that such a general
styie of action be adopted, as shall-be easily conceived
and easily executed, wlich, though not expressive of anly
particular passion, shall not be iriconsistent with the expression of any passion; which shall always keep the body
in a gracfJul positioni and shal so vary its motions, at

pr'Oper intervals- as to seem the subject operating on the
speaker, and riot the speakel on the subject. This, it will
-b confessed, is a great tesideratum; and an attempt to
do tlis, is the principal object of the present publicatione
The c        odificqy ofCdesCri,i)ng action by vords, will be allowed by every one; and if we were never to give any
instructions but such as.should completely answer our
wVishes, this difficulty -wvould be a good reason for not attemptino to give any description of it. But there are
many dqerees between conveying a precise idea of a thing,
and no idea at all. Besides, in this part of delivery, instruction may be conveyed by the eye; and this organ is
a mnuch more rapid vehicle of knowledage than the ear.
This 7eilclc  is addressed on the present occasion, and
plates, repiesenting the attitudes which are described,
are annexed to the several descriptions, which it is not
(loubted will greatly facilitate the reader's conception.
The first plate represe:nts tile attitude in which a boy
tshoulid alwvays place hilmself Ishen he begins to speak. IHe
should rest the w.vhole weio-ht of his bedy on the right leg;
tihe othler, just touching thie  rouncd, a the dcistance at
vwhlich it,would naturally flti, if lifted up to shew that the
body does not bear upon ito The knees should be strait
and braced, and. the body, though perfectly strait, not perpendicular, but inclining as far to the riglit as a firmn position on the rig-ht leg wvill permit.  The rigllt armn nmust
then be held out with tile palm open, the fing-ers straight
anid close, the tlihumb almost as distant firom themn as it will
go, and the filat of the hand neither horizontal nor vertical,
but exactly between both. iThe position of the arm perhaps will be best described by supposing an oblone- hollow
square, forim;ed by the measure of-four arrs, as in plate
the first, whlere the arm in its true position forms the
dia-or,al of sucii an imagcinary figure.  So that, if lines
were draw-n at rigght angles fiolm the shotilder, extendinglownwalrds, forwards, anid sideways, the ar&lt;.m will forml ana
angle of forty-five dcegrees every wvay.
When the pupil has pronounlced one sentence in the
position thus described, the hand, as if lifeless, must drop
down to the side, the very moment the last accepted
-word is pronounced; and the body, wvithout altering the
place of the feet, poise itself ovn the lft leg, while tht

left hand rises itself into exactly the same position  as
the ri-ght was before, and continues in this position till
the end of the next sentellce. -wheni it drops down on the
side, as if dead; and the body poizing itself on the right
eg as before, contilues with the ri,ht arm extiended, till
the end of the succeeding' sentence, and so'on from right
to left, and fr'olm left to risht alternately, till the slpeech
is ended.
Great care imnst be taken that the pupil end one senltence completely, before!ie begin anotherl  H  lmust Iet
the arm cdrop to the side,,and eo,ntinue for a 1mormenlt in

tIf the pu)pil's3 knees ar:- not wexll forimeed, or incline inw'.irds, he must be tau,l?t to keep his legs at as great a
distnce as possible, andl to incline his body so much to
th:it side, ow1-wvhich tile airm is -extended, as to oblige him
to 1ret the opposite lec utipo the toe; and this will, in a
reat melasure, hid_ te e defect of his hiake. In the same
mz-nneu r if the arim be-too long- or the elbow incline inp
Nwarcs, it will. he pro er to make him turn ~he palm of his
handl doxynwarpds, so' as. to make it perfectly hiorizontal.
This -wili infallibly incline the elbowv outwalrds and prooent- tihe wOrn.t position the arm  can possibly fall into,
whic'! is that of inclinring the elbow to the body. T his
psition of the hiand so necessarily keeps tle elbow out,
that it vould not be imiproper to lmalke the pupil sometines
practice it,:thoug1h he may have no defect in hlis nlarke;
as ail occasionlal alteration of thle former position to this,
may often be necessary both for the sake of justness and
variety. T'ieTse two last pos:tions of the legs and airins1
are described in plate sccoa1i.30     Tlhe houng Gentleman anld Lady's iMonitor,
has he described the breaches and violations of friendship i
" Whoso casteth a stone at the birds, frayeth them away;
" and he that upbraideth his friend, breaketh fiiendship.
"Thotgh thou drawest a sword at a fiienld, yet despair
" not, for there may be a returning to favor; if thou hast
"opened thy mouth against thy friendl, fear not, for there
"may be a reconciliation; except for upbraiding, or pride,
" or disclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound; for,
" for these things, every friend -will depart."
15. We may observe in this and several other precepts
in this authlor, those little familiar instances and illustrations which are so much admired in the moral writings of
lfcrace andl JJidctetus. There are ver-y beaultiful instances
of this nature in the following pages, which are likewise
written upon the salme subject:
16. " \Vhoso discovereth secrets, loseth his credit, and
" shall never find a firiend to his mind. Lcve thy friend,
* anld be fi-ithful unto hi:n; buit if thou bewravei,t his se" cret, follow no more after him; for as a maln hath de" stroyed his enemy, so hast thou lost the love of thyv' friendl; as one that le.teth a b'ilrd ro out o' his hand, so
" Ilast thou let thly friend go, and shalt not get him again:
" follow after him no more, for he is too far off; he is as
" a roe escaped out of the snare. As foi a wound, it may
" be bound up, and after reviling, tihere nlay be recon" ciliation; but he thlat bewrayethl secrets, is without
"hope."
17. Among the several qualifications of a good friend,
this wise man has very justly singled out constancy and
faithfillness as the principal; to these, others have added
virtue, knowledge, discretion, equality in age and fortune,
zld, as Cicero calls it, morunm conlitas, a pleasantness of
temper.
18. If I vwere to give my opinion upon such an exhausted
subject, I sl:ould join to these other qualifications a certain mquibility or evenness of behavliour. A man often
contracts a friendship with one whom perhaps he does
not find out till after a vear's conversation: when, on a
sudden, some latent ill-humour breaks out upon him,
which he never discovered or suspected at his first entering into an intimacy with him.
19. There are several persons who, in some certain peEEi I    -EMATS O'-GESTURE.When the pupil has got the habit of holdilng his hand
and arm properly, he may be taught to rmove it. I) this
mTotion he mustt be carefui to keep the arm fi'nm the bLckdy.

to approach to the side, but:l while the hand aE,nrd lo-wer

Ube in tune as it wvere to each other, and to force. andl

As Lhis motion of the arm is sorxewhat complicated, and
may be found difficult to execute it would Ib e ad-iseable
to let the pupil at frst spelak withott any nmotion) of the
arm at all. After some timine he will naturally all1 i,nto
a small curvature of tlie e!bo%r, to b)eat time, as iL were,'to the emphatic wocrd; and if, in C oing. this, he s Constantly urged i.o rais the elbowv, and to rkep it at a distance firom the body, the action of the arm will naturally
grow up into that e hae ihae just described..So the diagonal

uses that hand which is next the audience, hee ought likewise to lJoize his body upon the same leg: this is almost
an invariable rule in action: the hand sliould act on that
side- only on cwhich the body'bears. Good actors and
speakers may so-metimes depart from this rule, but such
only will know when to d6 it with propriety.
Occasion may be taken in the course of' the scene to
change sides. One speaker at the end of an impassioned
speech, may cross over to the place of the other, while
the latter at thle same momnent crosses over to the place of
the former.'Th'is, lowever, must be done with g'leat
care, and.so as to keep the back froml being turned to the
audience: But if this transition be performed adrloity, it
Awill have a very good effect in varying the position of the
speakers, and giving each an opportunity of using hiM
right hland-the most favourable to grcace and expression.Anlld if frorme so humble a scene as the school, we may be
p rrmitted to raise ourl observations to the senate, it miglht
t)e hinted, that'gentlemen on each side of the hIouse, while
addressing the chair, can with grace and propriety only
nmake use of one Ihand; namely, that which is next to the
speaker; and it may be observed -in passing, that to all
the other advantages of speaking, wvhich ar'e supposed to
Ibelong to one side of the house--may be added-the
gracful use of the right hand.
The better to conceive the position of two speaklers in a
scene, a plate is given representing their respective attit1ldes; and ic must fe careiullv n'oted, that when they are
not speaking, the arms must haing in their natural place

Firorn what has been laid dow-vn, it will evidently appear,
how nmuch morecdi-fficult and comlnplicate is the action.'of a

There are. indeed some masters who are against teaclh
ing boys any action. at all, andl are for leaving theln- in tlfis
point entirely to nature. It is happy, however,t that they
do not leave that action to nature, which is acquliled by
dancing; the deportment of their pupils wozvuld soon convince them. they were imposed on by the soun-d of words.
improved and beautiful nature is the obiect of the painter's
ipenciI, the poet's pen, and the rhetorician's- action, and
not that sordid and common nature, which is perfectly
rude and uncultivated. Nature di4'ects us to art, and art
selects and polishes the beauties of nature. It is not sufficient for anl orator, says Quintilian, that he is a man:  -
he lnust be an improved and cultivated. imall: he m1ust
be a mnan favoured by nature and fashioned by art.
But the necessity of adopting some meethod of teaching
action, is too evident to need p'oof., Boys wvill infalliblv
contract sonme action; to require tlhemn to stand stock-still
w-hile they atle speaking an imlassion,ed speech, is not only
exacting a very difficult task from them, but is, in a grleat
measure,` check!ig their nattill'ral exertions. If thleyv are
left to themselves, they wiil in all probability fall into very wild and unigraceful action,w]hich, Wnhen once formned
into habit, can scarcely ever be corre.lctd: giving them
therefrre a general out-line of good actioni, 1must be of the
tLtmost consequence to their pr'og~,ress and improve me nt
in pronunciation.
The great use, t-ierefore, of a system of action like tle
present, is, that a boy will ne1 evr be emllbaPrassed for want
of knowting,7 wlat to do witlh hlis legs and, omrns; nor will
he bestow that attention on his action, which ought to be
directed to hlis prolaunciation: he N\ill always be in a position whicl will not dCisgrace his igIure;  anid wvhen -tlis
g:esture is easy to hlilf,) it may serve as a ground-w.vork to
something inore perfect: he may either, by his own genius or his mraster's instructions, build solne other actionl
upon it, w,.hich may in time give it adeitional force and
variety.

In all thy humours, whether grave or mellow,

There is no living w-ith thee nor without thee.
20. It is very uiiluckv for a man to be entangled in a
friendship with one, Mho by these changes and vicissittudes
of humour is sometimes amiable, and sometimes odious:
and as most men are at some times in an admirable frame
and disposition of mind, it should be one of the greatest
tasks of wisdom to keep ourselves well when we are so,
and never to go out of that wvhich is the agreeable part of
our character.
SPFCTATOR, Vol. 1. No. 68.
21. " Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in
" two persons to promote the good and happiness of one
"anotlher."  Though the pleasures and advantages of
friendship have been largely celebrated by the best moral
writers, and are considered by all as great ingredients
of human happiness, we very rarely meet with the practice
of this virtue in the workl.
22. Every man is ready to give a long catalogue of
those virtues and good qualities he expects to find in the
person of a friend, but very few of us are careful to cultivate
them in ourselves.
Love and esteem are the first priinciples of friendslip,
which always is imperfect where either of these two is
wanting.
23. As on the one hand, we are soon ashamed of loving
a man whom we cannot csteemn; so on the other, though
we are truly sensible of a man's abilities, we can never raise
ourselves to the warmths of friendship, witho.t an affectionate geod will towards his person.

disguises. A man who can once doubt whether he should3,    -     E-- 2' E'I?ix's O: -GESTIrUR IE.

then he talks to himself, or makes grimaces. If he speaks
to another, his pauses are very long; the tone-of his voice
unvarying, and' his sentences broken, expressing half, antl
keeping in half of what arises in his mind.
Vexcation occasioned by some real or imaginary misfottune, agitates the whole frame; and, besides expressing
itself with the looks, gestures, restlessness, andt tone of
perplexity, it addlis complaint, fretting, and lamenting.
Pity, a mixed passion of love and grief, looks down
upon- distress with lifted hands; eyebrows drawn down;
mouth -open, and features drawn together. Its expression,
a.s to looks and gesture, is the same with those of suffering,
(see SiffiSring) but more moderate, as the painful feelings
are only sympathetic, and therefore one -remove, as i
were, morte distant from the soul, than what one feels ill
his own person.
Grief,) sudden and violent, expresses itself by b,eating
the head; glroveling on the ground; tearing of garmneents,
-hair, and flesh; screaming aloud, weeting, stamping with
the feet, lifting the eyes, from timne to tine, to heaven  
hurrying to and fro, running, distracted, or fainting away,
sometimes without recovery.  SO6metimes violent grief
produces a torpid silence, resembling total apathy.
eilelanrcholy, or fixed grief, is gloomy, sedentary, mrotionless. The lower jaw falls; thle lips pale; the eyes are
cast down.5 half shut, eye-lids swelled and red, or livit,
tears trickling silent, and unwiped; with a total inattention to every thing that passes. ~Words, if any,- few, andi

and interrupted, sighs breaking into the middle of sent-ences and words.

the'fists are clenched harld; the veins and muscles swelled;

great appearance of doubting and fear) to the throne of
heavenly mercy; and imm-ediately cast down again to the
earth. Then floods of tears are seen to flow. The knees
are bended, or the body prostrated on the ground. The
arms are spread in a suppliant posture, and the voice of
deprecation is uttered w7ith sighs, groans, timidity, hesitation and trembling.
Courage, steady, and cool, opens the countenance,
gives the whole form  an erect' and graceful air. T'he
accents are strong, filll-mouthed and articulate, lihe voice
firm and even.
Boasting, or afiected courage, is loud, blustering, threatening. -The eyes stare; the eyebrows draw,down; tile
face red and bloated; the nmouth pouts out;-tIhe voice- ollow and thunderin:g; the arnms ate set a-kimibo; the head
often nodding in a menacing manner; andl the right fist,.clenched, is brandished, from time to time, at the person threatened.  The right foot is often stampedi- upon
the groutnd, and the'legs take such large strides, and the
steps are so heavy, that tlhe earth seems to tremble unrder
them.
Pride, assumes a Iofty 10ok, brorering iupon the aspect

little raisedj but. with the most apparent timidity and
dread-; the eye is lifted, but immediately cast down again,
orf closed for a moment; the eyebrows are drawn down ili
the most respect-ul manner; the features, and the whole
body and limr-bs, are all composed to the most profounld
gravity; one posture continuing, without considerable
chainge, during the whole performance of the duty. The
knees bended, or the whole body prostrate, or if the posture
be standing, which scripture does not disallow, bending
forward, as ready to prostrate itself. The arms spread
out, but Tnodestly, as hig'h as- the breast;'the hands open.
The tone of the voice will be submissive, timid, equal
trembling, weak, suppliant. The words will be brought
out with a visible anxiety and diffidence, approaching to
hlesitation; few and slow; nothing of vain repetition, haa
ranguing, flowers of rhetoric, or affected figures of speech;
all simplicity, humility, anid lowliness, such as becomes a
reptile of the dust, when presurning to address Hlimn, whose
glleatness'is tremenduous beyond all created.conception.
In intercession for our fellow creatures, whiclh is prescribed in the scriptures, and in thanksgiving, the countenance will naturally assume a smnall degree of ch erfulness
beyond what it was clothed with in confession of sin, and
deprecation of punishmnent. But al affected oruament of
speech, or gesture in devotion, deserves the severest censure, as being somewhat mluclh worse than absurd.

equal'; spreads the arnms, wvith the hanlds open, as to receive the object of its longinlgs.  The tone of the voice is
eager and unevenly, inclining to that of joy, but curbed
by a degree-of doubt and anxiety. Desire differs from
hope- as to expression, in this particulah, that'there is rore
appearance of doubt and anxiety in the forimer than iln the
latter. For it is one thing to desire what is agreeable,
and another to have a prospect of actually obtainiing it.
DIsire expresses itself by bendcing the body forward,

Love (successful) lights up the countenance into smiles.
The forehead is smoothed and enlarged; the eyebrows are
arched; the mouth a little open, and smiling; the eyes
languishing, and half shut, doat upon the beloved object.
The countenance assumes the eager and wislhful look of
desire, (see Desire above) but; mixed with an ail' of satisfaction and repose. The accents are soft and winn ing;
the tone of voice persuasive, flattering, pathetic, various,
musical, rapturous, as in joy. (See oy.)  The attitude
mnluic the same with that of desire. Sometimes both hanids
plresed eagerly to the bosom. Love, unsuccessful, adds
an air of anxiety and melancholy. See Perlrx:ity and

Gratitude puts on an aspect full of complacency. (See
Love.) If thle object of it is a chalracter greatly supel'rior, it
expresses much submission. (See lbodesty.)  The right
hand pressed tipon the,breast, accomlpanies, very properly,
the expression of a sincere and hearty sensibility of obligation.
Cirriosily, as of a-busy-body, opens the eyes and mouth,

Perasuasion puts on the looks of mhoderate love. (Sea

Promnising is expressed w-ith benevolent looks, the nod

Af'ctation, displays itself in a tholsanid diferent gestures, motions, airs and looks, according to the character

the words godly doggrell. Affectation of beauty, and killing,' puts a fine woman by turns into all sorts of forms, appearances and attitudes, but amniable ones. She undoes
by art, or rather by aukwardness, (for true art conheals
itself) all that nature had done for her. Nature formed
her almost: an angel, and she, with infinite pains, makes
herself a monkey. Therefore, this species of affectation
is easily imitated, or taken off. Make as many and as
ugly grimaces, moLions and gestures as can be made, and
take care that nature never peep out, and you represent
coquetish affectation to the life.
Slot/h appears by yawning, dosing, snoring; the head

People who walk in their sleep (of which our inimitable
Shakespear has, in his tragedy of MAcErCnTH, drawn out a
fine scene) are said to have their eves open; though they
are not, the more for' that, conscious of any thing, but- the
dream -hich has got possession of their imagination. I
never saw one of those persons, therefore cannot describe
tlheir imanner from nature; but I suppose their speech is
pretty much like that ouf persons drearning, inarticulate,
incohlerent, and very diflerent, in its tolne, from wlhat it

Iztoxication shews itself by the eyes half shut, sleepy,

~version, or iazaitred, expressed to, or of- any F.erson or

it off. The face turned away from that side toward which
the hands are thrownl out; the eyes looking angrily and
asquint the same ivay the hands are directed; the eyebrows drawn downwards; the upper lip disdainfillly drawn

short and abrupt.
Conmmndcation, or.4PI7rob6ation, from  a superior, puts
on the aspect of love (excluding desire and respect) and
expresses itself in a mild tone of voice; the arms gently
spread; the palms of th'e hands toward the person approved. Exhorting or encouraging, as of an army by a
general, is expressed wi7th some part of the looks and
action of courage..
Jealous. would be likely to be well expressed by one,
wvho had often seen prisoners tortured in the dungeons of
the inquisition, or who had seen what the dungeons of the
inquisitio,n are the best earthly emblem of; I mean Hell.
For next to being in the Pope's or in Satan's prison, is the

Being a nmi7xture of passions directly contrary to one another, the person, whose soul is the seat of such conflusion
and tumult, must be in as much greater min_--ery than Pronmetheus, with -the vulture tearing his liver, as the pains
of the mind are greater than those of the body. Jealousy
is a ferment of love, hatred, hope, fear, shame, anrxiety,
suspicion, grief; pity, envy, pride, rage, cruelty, vengeance, madiess, and if there be any other tormenting
passion which can agitate the human nmind. Therefore
to express jealousy well, requires that one know how to
represent justly all these passions by turns, (see Love,
iatirecl, &amp;c.) and often several of them together. Jealousy
shews itself by restlessness, peevishness, thoughtfulness,
anxiety, absence of mind. Sometimes it bursts out inELEiIENT7'S OP GESTURyE.              377
piteous complaint and weeping; thern a gleam of hope,
that all is yet well, lights up the countenance into a momentary smile. Immediately the face, clouded with a
general gloom, shews the:mind ove rcast again with horrid suspicions and frightful imaginations. Then the arms
are folded upon the breast; the fists violently clenched;
the rolling, bloody eyes dart firy. He hurries to and

the sport of winds and waves. Againi, he composes himself a little to reflect on the charm-s of the suspected person.
She appears to his imagination like the sweetness of the
rising dawn. Then his monstersbreeding fancy represents
her as false as she is fair. Then he roars out as one on
the rack, when the cruel engine rends every joint, and
every sinew bursts.  Then he throws himself on the
ground. Hie beats his head against the pavement. Then
he springs up, and with the look and action of _a fury bursting hot from the abyss, he snatches the instrument of
leath, and, after ripping up the bosom of the loved, suspected, hated, lamented, fair one, he stabs himself to the
heart, and exhibits a striking proof, how terrible a creature a puny mortal is, when agitated by an-infernal pa3sion.
Dotage, or0 i;frmn old arje, shews itself by talkativeness,
boasting of the past, hollowness of the eyes and cheeks,
dimness of sig-hl, deafness, tremor of voice, the accents,

Mx!'edd-assions, 0or emotions of the rmind, require a
mD. ixed:exp1'ession.   Pity, for exampl%e, is con'posedof
grief and love. It is thereiere evident,  t hat a co,rrect
speaker must, by his looks anc gestlures ancd b1 tie tone
and pitch of his voice, express both grief aini love, in expressing pity, and so of thle rest.
It is to be remenbered, th.atu tihe action, in expressinog
thle various hulrours and passions, for which  I lia-e here
given rules, iS 1o be s5uited to the age, sex, conlditioin a.nd
circumsta-tces of the character. Vol'-nt anger, cr rage,
for example, is to. be expi essed with great,i-tation. (see

or sensibility of pain; but not in the same manner as a
girl wvould express those sensations. Grief may be expressed by a person reading a melancholy story, or description of a room. It may be acted upon the stage. It
may be dwelt upOQ-n by the pleader at the bar; or it may
have a place in a sermon. Thlle passion is still grief.
But the manner of expressing it will be different in each,
of the speakers, if they have judgment.
A correct speaker does not\make a- movement of limb,
or feature, for which he has not a reason. If he addresses
heaven, he looks upward. If he speaks to his fellow-creatures, he looks round upon them. The'spirit of what lie
says, or is said to him, appears in his look. If he expresses amazement, or would excite it, he lifts up his hands
and eyes. If he invites to virtue and happiness, he spreads
his arn),s,,and looks benevolent. If he threatens the vengeance of heaven against vice, he hends his eyebrow into
wrath and menaces with his arm and countenance. He
does not needlessly'saw the air with his arm, nor stab himself with his finger. He does not clap his right hand upon his breast, unless he has occasion to speak of himself,
er to introduce conscience, or somewhat sentimental. IHe
ldoes not start back, unless he wants, to -express horror or
aversion.- He does not cone forward, but when he has
occasion to solicit. He does not raise his voice, biut to
express somewhat peculiarly'emphatical. He does not
lower-it, but to contrast the raising of it. His eyes, by
turns, according to the humour of the mnatter-he has to
express, sparkle fury, brighten-into joy, glance disdain,
xnelt into gTief, firown disgust and!itred, langiish into

FROM BLAIR's LECTURES.
THE   first object of a reader or speaker, is, to be clealr
ly truderstood by his hearers. In order for this, it is netessary that he should pronounce his words distinctly, and
deliberately; that he should:carefully avoid the two extremes of uttering either too fast, or too slow; and that
his tone of voice should be perfectly natural.
A reader.or speaker should endeavor to acquire a peri
fect command of his vtoite; so as neither to stun his heaters by pitching it upon too high a key;-. nor tire their patience by obliging them to listen to sounds which are
tcarcely audible. It is not the loudest speaker, who is
always the best understood; but he who pronounces upon
that key which fills the space occupied by the audience~
That pitch of voice, which is used -in ordinary conversalion, is usually the best for a public speaker.
Early attention ought to be paid to the pauses; but the
a'ules for these are so indefinite and arbitrary, and so difficult to be comprehended, that long experience is necessaryf inorder to acquire a perfect knowledge of their use.
XVith regard- to: the length of the several pauses, no precise rules can be given. This, together with the variety
of tones which accompany them, depends much upon the
niature of the subject,
Perhaps nothing is of isore importance to a reader or
speaker, than a proper attention to accent, emphasis, and
cadence,  Every word in our language, of more than one
syllable, has, at least, one accented syllable. This syl.
lable ought to be rightly known, and the-word should be
pronounced by -the readeror speaker in the same mannetr
as he would pronounce it in otdinary conversation.
By emphasis, we distinguish those words in a sentence
thich w ete,ma the moa'ipport!t, by laying a lrcatcr
11-I.I  I   A      I                I.~~&amp; ~~issor~~~ b~cJb~fuiONV EliIDIX''.JZi A'  D SPL.klvrG.    s.-;
sLresos of voice upon them than we do-rupon the others.
And. it is surprising- to obser-rve h ow teo sense of a ph. ase
may be altered by varying the emplhasis. -The ifollowi-,[g
example will serve as an illustratioin.
This short question,' Will you ride to town to-day?"
may be understood in fotur different ways, and consequently, may receive four different answers) according to
the placing of the emphasis:
If it be pronounced thus; WVl iiI/oz ride to town to-day?
the answer may properly be, no; I shall send mvy son. If
thus;, Will youn ride to towni to day-; Answer, no; I intend to walk. Will you ride to town;z to-davy? No; I shail
ride into the country. Will you ride to townv7 to-day?
No; but I shall to-morrow.
Thlis shows how necessary it is that a readler or speakler
should know where to place his emphasis. And the only
rule for this is, that he study to attain a just conceptio of`L.
the force and spirit of the sentimntnts which he deliver7s.
There is as great a difference between one who:lays hiS
emphasis properly, and- one who pays no regard to it, o?r
places it wrong, as there is between one who plays on an
inlstrument with a masterly hand, and the m  ost bungling
performer.
Cadence is ine reverse ot emDpiasis. it is a depre,siornt
or lowering of the voice; and commonly falls upo n t1he
las't syllable in a sentence. It is varied, however, according to the sense. WVhen a question is asked:,- it seldo.n
falls upon' the last word; and many sentences require lno
cadence at all.
In addiition to what has been sdaid, it is of great importance to attend particularly to tones and gestures. T'Lo a.lmost ever'y sentiment ve utterl, more especially, to every
strong emotion, --naturie has adapted some peculiari tone of
voice. And we may observe, that every man, when- hie is
much in earnest in comumon dciscour'se, when he is opeakin!g on some subject which interests hini nearlyv, has an
eloquenit or persuasive tone and manner.
If one were to tell another tlhat he wa-s very angry, or
very much grieved, in a tonie which did not suit such enotions, instead of being believed, he would be lautghed at.
The best direction whichl call be given, is) to. cpy the482      ON REdADING XA,ND SPAESKING.
proper tones for expressing every sentiment froom those
which nature di6ates to us in conversation with others.
WVith respect to gesture, the few following hints may
be of some service, Wheen speaking in public, one should
endeavor to preserve as much dignity as possible in the
whole attitude of the body. An erect posture is generally
to be chosen; standing firm so as-to have the fullest comrnJaand of all his motions. - Any inclination, which is used,
should be forwards towards the hearers, which is a natueeal expression of earnestness.
As for the countenance, the chief rule is, that it should
orrespond with the nature of the discourse; and when no
particular emotion is expressed, a serious and nmanly look
is always the best.,. The eyes should never be fixed cl6se
on any one object, but nmore easily round upon  the whole,audience.
In the.motions made with ttbe hands consists the chief
part of gesture in speaking-. The right hand should be
_Used more frequently thlrn the left. WVarnl emotions de-~
mand the motion of'both hands corresponding togetheroAll the gestures should, be free and easy. Perpendicular'
movemcents wvitil the hancs, that is, in a straight line up
anid downt' are seldoln good. Oblique motions are'in general, the m-ost gracefuil.
Motions miade with the hands should proceed rather
ji-om the shoulders than friom tihe elbows; for they appear
muchm more easy. Too siudden and nimble motions should
be' avoided. Earnest,ness can be i'ully expressed without
them. Above all thinings, a speaker snould guard against
affectation, whibch is always disgilstfil.

what he read, and nwhither he intended to go; and the
latter gave him constantly an exact accountofall his affairs.
1. A likeness of' inclinations in every particular is zo
far from being requisite to forml  a benevolence in two
minds towai-ds eaclh oth.er, as it is generally ilnagined, that
I believe we shall find some of the firmest fiiendships to
have been contracted between persons of different humours; the mind being often pleased with those perfections which are new to it, and which it does not find among
its own accomplishments.
32. Besides that a man in some measure supplies his
own defects, and fancies himself at second-hand possessed
of those good qualities and endowments, which are in the
possession of him who in the eye of the world is looked
on as his other self.
33. The most difficult province in friendship is the letting a man see his faults and errors, which should, if
possible, be so contrived, that he may perceive our advice
is given him not so much to please ourselves, as for his
own advantage. The reproaches, therefore, of a friendc
should alwavs be strictly just, and not too frequent.
34. The violent desire of pleasing in the person reproved may otherwise change into a despair of doing it, while
he finds himself censured for faults he is not consciotis of.
A mind that is softened and humanized by frieui ship, canriot bear frequent reproaches: either it mn-hst qt  slnk
under the oppriession, or albate considerably of the value
and eseem it had fir hiin whio-bestows them.
o3. The proper bussiness of friendship is to inspire life
and courage; and a soul, thus supported, out-does itself;
whereas if it be unxp ctecdly deprived of these succoursx,
it droops and languishes.
36. WVe are in some measure more inexcusable if we
Yviolate our duties to a friend, than to a relation; since th'e
former arise from a voluntary choice, the latter firom a necessity, to which we could not give our own consent.
37. As it has been said on one side, that a man ougliht
not to break with a faulty friend, that he may not expose.
the weakness of his choice; it will doubtless hold muct
stronger with respect to a worthy one, that he may revepi
be upbraided for having lost so alduable a treature whicl
was once in his posesseion.

those sounds w.hich require an emphatical pronunciation,
and read aloud with all the exertion they can command;
let all the consonant sounds be expfiresed with a full impulse

In order to remedy these defects, and to ease the teacher,.I would advise, that several young gentlemen read in a

and let hinz who reads best, be advanced to the head, or
have sonme pecuniary reward; and every inferior one according to his meirit; this will create emulation among then,.and facilitate their implrovenlent much more than threats or

where I visit, so that I am afraid you are wholly tInacquainted with what passes armong my part of the world,
who are, though I say it, without controversy, the most
accomplished and best bred in the town.
2. Give me leave to tell you, that I am extremely discomposed when I hear scandal, and am an utter enemy
to all manner of detraction, and think it the greatest
meanness that people of distinction can be guilty of; however, it is hardly possible to come into company, where
you do not find them pulling one another to pieces, and
thlat from no other. provocation but that of hearing any
ene commended.
3, Merit, both as to wit and beauty, is become no other
than the possession of a few trifling people's favor, which
you cauinot possibly arrive at, if you have really any thing
in you that is deserving.
4. What they would bring to pass is, to make all good
end evil consist in report, and with whisper, calumnies,
and impertinence, to have the conduct of those reports.
5. By this means innocents are blasted upon their first
appearance in town: and there is nothing more required
to make a young woman the ol)ject of envy and hatred,
than to deserve love and admiration.
6. This abominable endeavour to suppress or lessen
every thing that is praise-worthy, is as frequent among the
men as women. If I can remember what passed at a visit
last night, it will serve as an instance that the sexes are
equally inclined to defamation, with equal malice, witl
equal impotence.
7. Jack Triplett came into my Lady.Airy's about eight
of the clock. You know the manner we sit at a visit, and
I need not describe the circle; but Mr. Triplett came in,
introduced by two tapers supported by a spruce servant,
whose hiair is under a cap till my lady's candles are all lighted up, and the hour of ceremony begins.
8. I say Jack Trilfiltt came in, and singing (for he is
really good company)' Every featur'e, charming creature,'
-he went on. It is a most unreasonable thing that peo.
pie cannot go peaceably to see their friends, but these
ull_rderies are let loose.J 5i

peculiarly graceful.
13. lMr. TriI/lett, vwho is a woman's man, seemed to hIa r

iind; he never heard, indeed, but that lie vwas a vcry

ed, how much it was beholden to a marriage for the plcsent circumstances of it: after all, he could see nothing;
but a common man in his person, his breeding or understanding.
14. Thus, Mr. Spectator, this iimpertinent humour of
diminishing every one xvho is produced in conversation to
their advantage, runs through the wvorld; and I am, I confess, so fearful of the force of illi tongues, that I have begged of all those who are my well-wishers, never to comsnend me, for it will but bring my firailties into exanlination, and I had rather be unobserved, than conspicuous
for disputed perfections.
15. I am confident a thousand young people, who would
have been ornaments to society, have, from fear of scandal,
sever dared to exert themselves in the polite arts of life.
-Their lives have passed away in an odious rusticity, in
spite of great adlvantages of person, genius and fortune.
16. There is a vicious terror of being blamed in some
tell-inclined people, and a wicked pleasure in suppressing
them in others; both which I recommend to VouIr spectatorial wisdom to animadvert upon: and if you call be successful in it, I need not say how much you will deserve of
the town; but new toasts Nwill owe to you their beauty,
and new wits their fame.
17. Truth and reality have all the advantages of appearance, and many more. If the show of any thing be
good for any thing, I am sure sincerity is better: for why
does any man dissemble, or seem to be that which he is
not, but because he thinks it good to have such a quality'as he pretends to? for to counterfeit and dissemble, is to
put on the appearance of some real excellency.
18. Now the best way in the world for a man to seem to
be any thing, is really to be what he would seem to be.
2Besides that, it is many times as troublesome to make
good the pretence of a good quality, as to have it; and if
a man have it not, it is ten to one but he is discovered to'want it, and then all his pains and labour to seem to have.
it, is lost. There is something unnatural in painting,
vwhich a skilful eye will easily discern from native beauty
and complexion.
19. It is hard to personate and act a part long; for
where truth is' not at the bottom, nature will always he en-aand Elg,lih -Teacher's Assistant..7
deavouriig to return, and iwill peep out and betray herself
one time or other.'rherefore, if any man think it convenient to seeml good, let him be so indeed, and the.uhis
goodness will appear to every body's satisfaction; so that
upon all accounts sincerity is true wisdom.
20. Particularly as to the affairs of this world, integrity
hath many advantages over all the fine and artificial wavs
of dissimulation and deceit; it is much the plainer and
easier, much the safer and more secure way of dealing in
the world; it has less of trouble and difficulty, of entanglement and perplexity, of danger and hazard in it: it is
the shortest and nearest way to our end, carrying us thither in a straight line, and will hold out and last longest.
21. The arts of deceit and cunning do continually grow
veaker and less effectual and serviceable to them that use
them; whereas integrity gains strength by use, and the
more and longer any man practiseth it, the greater service
it does him, by confirming his reputation, and encouraging those with whom he hath to do, to repose the greatest
trust and confidence in him, which is an unspeakable advantage in the business and affairs of life.
22. Truth is always consistent with itself, and needs
nothing to help it out; it is always near at hand, and sits
upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are
aware; whereas a lie is troublesome, and sets a man's
invention upon the rack, and one trick needs a great many more to make it good.
23. It is like building upon a false foundation, which
continually stands in need of props to shoar it up, and
proves at last more chargeable, than to have raised a substantial building at first upon a true and solid foundation;
for sincerity is firm and substantial, and there is nothing
hollow and unsound in it, and because it is plain and open,
fears no discovery:
24. Of which the crafty man is always in danger, and
when he thinks he walks in the dark, all his prletences are
so transparent, that he who runs may read them; he is
the last man that finds himself to be found out, and whilst
he takes it for granted that he makes fools of others, he
renders himself ridiculous.
25. Add to all this, that sincerity is the most compendipus wisdom! and an excellent instrument for thle speedy,38   T27e %a1' u;zg Gc?:'trl e ic!&amp;  d Lay's Mii Lau it.i:',

actions; for nothing but this will last and hold out to the
end; all other arts will fail, but truth and integrity will
carry a man through, and bear him out to the last.
31. WiVhen Aristot!e was once asked, what a man could
gain by utterling falsehoods? he replied, "n ot to be credited when he shall tell the truth."
The character of a lyar is at once so hateful and contemptible, that even of those who have lost their virtue it
might be expected, that from the violation of truth they
should be restrained by their pride. Almost every other
vice that disgraces human nature, may be kept in counte.
nance by applause and association.
32. The corrupter of virgin innocence sees himself en.
vied by the men, and at least not detested by the women:
the drunkard may easily unite with beings, devoted like
himself to noisy merriment or silent insensibility, who will
celebrate his victories over the novices of intemperance,
boast themselves the companions of his promwes, and tell
with rapture of the multitudes whom unsuccessful emulation has hurried to the grave: even the robber and the
cut-throat have their followers, whoadmrnire their address
and intrepidity, their stratagems of rapine, and their
fidelity to the gang.
33. The lyar, and only the lyar, is invariably and universally despised, abandoned and disowned: he has no domestic consolations, which he can oppose to the censure
of mankind; he can retire to no fraternity where his crimes
may stand in the place of virtues, but is given up to the
hisses of the multitude, without friend and without apologist. It is the peculiar condition of falsehood, to be
equally detested by the good and bad: " The devils," says
Sir Thomas B?-rown7 "i do not tell lies to one another; for
"truth is necessary to all societies; nor can the society
" of hell subsist without it."
34. It is natural to expect, that a crime thus generally
detested, should be geneorally avoided; at least that none
should expose himself to unabated and unpitied infamy,
without an adequate temptation; and that to guilt So easily
detected, and so severely punished, an adequate temptation would not readily be found.
35. Yet so it is, that in defiance of censure and cona
temrpt, trutl is frequently violated; and scarcely the prt40)   The Jroung C.&gt;4e.:,;':f Z  ad 7::C d J:y',S Mc.'ito,

the subject of' con-veration cculd not have iee n expected
to put the passions in motion, or to have excite i  either
hope or fear, or zeal or malignity, suffcient to induce
any man to put his reputation in hazard, however little
he might value it, or to overpower the love of truth, how--
ever Nwieak might be its influence.
36.'The casutists have very diligently distinguished lies
into their several classes, according to th-eir various dlegrees of malignity; but they have, I think, generally
omitted that whiclh is mnst eommion, and, perhaps, not
less mischievous; which, since the moralists have jnot
given it a name, I shall distinguish as the lie of vanity.
To vanity may jutstly be imputed most of the falsehoods
which every man perceives hourly playing upon his ear,
and perihaps ncost of those that are propagated wlith success.
37. To-_tie lie of commerce,Tara' the lie of malice, the
motive is so apparenlt, that they are,~sedom negligently or
implicitly received: suspicion is always watchful over the
practices of interest; and whatever the hope of gain, or
desire of mischief, can prompt one man to assert? another
is, by reasons equally cogent, incited to refute.  But
v:anity pleases herself withl such slig;ht gratifications, and
looks forwar-d to pleasure so remiotely consequential, that
her p)ractices raise no alarmi, and her stratagems are not
easily discovered.
38. Vanity is, intdeed, often suffered to pass tinpursued
by suspicion; because lie that would watch her motions,
cain never be at rest; fiaud and nlalice are lbounlded in
their influence; some opportunity of time an(l place is
necessary to their agency; but scarce any man is abstract-.ed one moment -from his vanity; and he, to whoin truth
afiords no gtirafications, is generally inclined to seek them
in falsehoods.
39. It is remlarklied by Sir Kenclmb DiBgby,  tllhat every
man has a desire to appear superior to others, thoug:h,- it

of these men, to stun all com.pa: ies with noisy informn'ation; to still doubt, and ovel,rbe lx opossition, with cer ain
knovwledge or auithentic intehlige,ce.
42. A lyar of this kincld, iw-ith a strong memory or bri'sk
ilnaginration, is often the oracle of an obscure cluh, and!,
tilltime discoverls 1is impostures, dictates to his leCaire:s
wvith uceintroled authority: foIr if a public question be
started, he vwas present at the debate; if a nlew fashlion be
merntioned, he was at court the first day of its appea.ranc e;
if a new periormance of literature draws the attention &gt;of
tlh  public, lie has patronized the authoi, and seCen his
wvorkl in maIluscript; if a criminal of eminence be condemnied to die, he often predicted his fate, an(l endeavoured his reformlation; and who that lives at a distance fi'onm
the scenle of action, w-ill dare to contradict a man, who
reports froim his own eyes and ears, and to whom all persoins and affairs are thus intimately known?
43. This kind of faiselood i.generllv successful for x
timec, because it is practised at firstwith timiditv and caution; but the prosperity of the lyar is of short duration ~
the ecention  of onil story is always an incitement to the4`2    The lYung Ge-netlenan endf Lady's MAolniter,
forgery of another less probable; andl he goes on to triumph over tacit credulity, till pride or reason rises up
against him, and his companions will no longer endure
to see him wiser than themselves.
44. It is apparent, that the -inventors of all these fictions
intend some exaltation of themselves, and are led off by
the pursuit of honour firom their attenldance upon truth:
their narratives always imply some consequence in favor
of their courage, their sagacity, or their activity, their
familiarity with the learned, or their reception among the
great; they arc always bribed by the present pleasure of
seeing thenlselves superior to those that surround them,
and receiving the homage of silent attention and envious
admiration.
45. But vanity is sometimes excited to fiction b)i less
visible gratifications: the present age abounds wvith a
race of Iyars who are content with the consciousness of
falsehood, and whose pride is to deceive others without
any gain or glory to then-selves. Of this tribe it is the
supreme pleasure to remlark a lady in the play-house or
the park, and to publish, under the character of a man
suddenly enamoured, an advertisement in the news of the
next day, containing a minute description of her person
and her dress.
46. From this artifice, however, no other effect can be
expected, than perturbations which the writer can never
see, and conjectures of which he can never be informed:
-some mischief, however, he hopes he has done; and to
have done mischief is of some importance. He sets his
invention to work again, and produces a narrative of a robbery, or a murder, with all the circumstances of the time
a.nd place accurately acljusted. This is a jest of greater
effect and longer duration. If he fixes his scene at a proper distance, he may for several days keep a wife in terror for her husband, or a mother for her son; and please
himself with reflecting, that by his abilities and address
some addition is made to the miseries of life.
47. There is, I think, an ancient law in Scotland, by
which Leaainzg-making was capitally punished. I am, indeed, far firom desiring to increase in this kingdonl the

of intelligence, and interrupt the security of life; harrass
the delicate with shame, and perplex the timorous with
alarms; might vely properly be awakened to a sense of
their crimes, by denunciations of a whipping-post or a
pillory: since many are so insensible of right and wrong,
that they have no standard of action but the law; nor
feel guilt, but as they dread punishment.
Thle Importance of Punctuality.
1. IT is observed in the writings of IBoyle, that the ex.cellency of manufactures and the facility of labor would
be much promoted, if the various expedients and contrivances which lie concealedl in private hallds, were, by reciprocal communications, made generally known; for there
are few operations that are not performed by one or other
with some peculiar advantages, which, though singly of
little importance, would, by conjunction and concurrence,
open new inlets to knowledge, and give new powers to
diligence.
2. There are in like manner several moral excellencies
deistributed among the various classes of mankind, which
he that converses in the wvorld should endeavor to assemble in himself. It was said by the learned Cajucius, that
he never read more than one book, by which he was not
ilnstructed; and he-that shall inquire after virtue with ardour and attention, will seldom find a man by whose. example or sentiments he may not be improvel.
3. Every profession has some essential and appropriate
virtue, without which there can be no hope of honor or
success, and which, as it is more or less cultivated, confers
within its sphere of activity different degrees of merit and
reputation. - As the astrologers range the subdivisions of
mankind under the planets which they suppose to influence their lives, the moralist may distribute them accorlding to the virtues which they necessarily practise, and
consider them as distinguished by prudence or fortitude9
diligence or patience.

and place, that man may be heard-WaBsting in onm.strect

and satire, are varied according to the scveral virtues or
vices which the course of our lives has disposed us to admire or abhor; but he who is solicitous fbr his own improvement, must not suffer his affairs to be limited by
local reputation, but select from every tribe of mortals
their characteristical virtues, and constellate in himself the
scattered graces which shine single in other men.
5. The chief praise to which a trader generally aspires,
is that of punctuality, or an exact and rigorous observance
of commercial promises and engagements; nor is there
any lice of which he so much dreads the imputation, as
of negligence and instability. This is a quality which the
interest of mankind requires to be diffused through all the
ranks of life, but which, however useful and valtuable,
many seem content to want: it is considered as a vulgar
and ignoble virtue, below the ambition of greatness, or
attention of wvit, scarcely requisite among men of gaiety
and spirit, and sold at its highest rate when it is sacrificed
to a frolic or a jest.
6. Every man has daily occasion to remark what vexations and inconveniences arise firom this privilege of (deceiving one another. The active and vivacious have so
long disdained the restraints of truth, that promnises and
appointments have lost thleir cogency, and both parties
neglect their stipulations, because each concludes that
they will be broken by the other.
7. Negligence is first admitted in trivial affairs, and
strengthened by petty indulgences. He that is not yet
hardened by custom, ventures not on the violation of important engagements,but thinks himself bound by his word
in cases of property or danger, though he allows himself
to forget at what time he is to meet ladies in the park, or
at what tavern his friends are expecting him.
8. This laxity of honor wouldl be more tolerable, if it
could be restrained to the play-house, the ball-room, or
the card table; yet even there it is sufficiently troublesome, and darkens those moments with expectation, suspence, uncertainty and resentment, which are set aside
fbr the softer pleasures of life and from which we naturally
hope for unmingled enjoyment, and total relaxation. l3But

9..4li,er entered into the world a youth of lively imagina,tion, extensive views, and untainted principles. His
curiosity incited him to range from place to place, and try
all the varieties of conversation; his elegance of address
and fertility of ideas gained him friends wherever he appeared; or at least he found the general kiindness of reception always shewn to a young man whose birth and
fortune gave him a claim to notice, and who has neither
by vice or folly destroyed his privileges.
10..tii ger was pleased with this general smile o?g mankind, and being naturally gentle and flexible, was industrious to preserve it by compliance and officiousness, but
did not suffer his desire of pleasing to vitiate his integrity.
It was his established maxim, that a promise is never to
be broken; nor was it without lotg reluctance that he
once suffered himself to be drawn away from a festal engagement by the importunity of another comipany.
1 1. He spent the evening, as is usual in the rudiments
of vice, with perturbation and imperfect enjoyment, and
mnet Iris disappointed friends in the morning with confusion
and excuses. His companions, not accustomed to such
scrupulous anxiety, laughed at his uneasiness, compound~ed the offence for a bottle, gave him courage to break his
word again, and again levied the penalty.
12. He ventured the same experiment upon another
society; and found them equally ready to consider it as a
venial fault, always incident to a man of quickness and
gaiety; till by degrees he began to think llimself at liberty
to follow the last invitation, and was no longer shocked at
the turpitude of falsehood.  He made no difficulty to
promise his presence at distant places, and if listlessness
happened to creep upon him, would sit et home with great
tranquillity, and has often, while he sunk to sleep in a
chair, held ten tables in continual expectation of his entrance.
13. He found it so pleasant to live in perpetual vacancy,
that he soon dismissed his atteiltion as an useless incumbrance, and resigned himself to carelessness and dissipation, without any regard to the future or the past, or any46    h7le Young Centleman and Lady's Monitor,

had no influence upon his conduct. He was in speculation completely just, but never kept his promise to a
creditor; he was benevolent, but always deceived those
friends whom he undertook to patronize or assist; he was
prudent, but suffered his affairs to be embarrassed for
want of settling his accounts at stated times.
14. He courted a young lady, and when the settlements
were drawn, took a ramble into the country on the day
appointed to sign them. He resolved to travel, and sent
his cl- sts on ship-board, but delayed to follow them till
he lost his passage. He was summoned as an evidenlce
in a cause of great ilnportance, and loitered in the way
till the trial was past. It is said, that when he had w-itlh
great expense formed an interest in a borough, his opponent contrived by some agents, who knew his temper, to
lure him away on the day of election.
15. His benevolence diraws him into the commission of
athousand crimes, wvhich others, less kind or civil, would
escape. His courtesy invites application, his promises
produce dependence: he has his pockets filled with petitions, whlich he intends some time to deliver and enforce;
and his table covered with letters of request, with whiclh
he purposes to comply; but time slips imperceptibly
away, while he is eithler idle or busy: hIis friends lose
their opportunities, andl charge upon him their miscarriages and calamities.
Thiis character, hoewever contemptible, is not peculiar
to.diger.
16. They whose activity of imagination is often shifting
the scenes of expectation, are fiequently subject to such
sallies of caprice as to make all their actions fortuitous,
destroy the vaiue of their friendship, obstruct the efficacv
of their virtues, and set them below the meanest of those
that persist in their resolutions, execute what they design,
and perform what they have promised.
Exercise &amp; T7'emperance the best Preservative of liHcalth.
1. BODILY labor is of two kinds, either that which a
wan submits to for his livelihood, or that which he underand English Teacher's Assistant.      47
goes for his pleasure.  The latter of them  generally
changes the name of labor for that of exercise, bLut differs
only from ordinary labor as it rises from another motive.
A country life abounds in both these kinds of labor,
and for that reason gives a man a greater stock of health,
and consequently a more perfect enjoyment of himself,
than any other way of life.
2. 1 consider the body as a system of tubes and glands
or, to use a more rustic phrase, a bundle of pipes and
strainers, fitted to one another after so wonderful a manner, as to make a proper engine for the soul to work with.
This description does not cnly comprehend the bowels,
bones, tendons, veins, nerves and arteries, but every muscle and every ligature, which is a composition of fibres,
that are so many imperceptible tubes or pipes interwoven
on all sides with invisible glands or strainers,
3. This general idea of a human body, without considering it in its niceties of anatomy, let us see how absolutely
necessary labor is for the right preservation of it. There
nmust be frequent motions and agitations, to mix, digest,
-and separate the juices contained in it, as well as to clear
and disperse the infinitude of pipes and strainers of which
it is composed, and to give their solid parts a more firm
and lasting tone. Labor or exercise ferments the humors,
casts them into their proper channels, throws off redundancies, and helps nature in those secret distributions,
vvithout which the body cannot subsist in its vigo:', nor
the soul act with cheerfulness.
4. I might here mention the effects which this has upon
all the faculties of the mind, b,y keeping the understanding clear, the imagination untroubled, and refining those
spirits that are necessary for the proper exertion of our
intellectual faculties, during the present laws of unioa
between soul and body. It is to a neglect in this particu-,ary that we must ascribe the spleen, which is so frequent
in men of studious and sedentary tempers, as well as the
vapours to which those of the other sex are so often subject.
5. Had not exercise been absolutely necessary for our
well-being, nature would not have made the body so proper for it, by giving such an activity to the limbs, and
s,ch a pliancy to every part, as necessarily produce those
2;48   lThe Yountg Gentleman and LJady's Monitor,
compressions, extensions, contortions, dilations, and all
other kinds of motions that are necessary for the preservation of such a system of tubes and glands as has beea
before mentioned. And that we might not want inducemenits to engage us in such an exercise of the body. as i.
proper for its welfare, it is so ordered, that nothing-valuable can be procured without it. Not to mention richec,
and honor, even food and raiment are not to be come at
without the toil of the hands and sweat of the brows.
6. Providence furnishes materials, but expects that we
should work them up ourselves. The earth must be labored before it gives its increase, and when it is forced
into its several products, how many hands must they pass
through before they are fit for use. Manufactures, trade
and agriculture, naturally employ more than nineteen
parts of the species in twenty; and as for those who are
not obliged to labor, by the condition im which they are
bcrn, they are more miserable than the rest of mankind,
unless they indulge themselves in that voluntary labor
which goes by the name of exercise.
7. My friend Sir Roger hath been an indefatigable man
in buisiness of this kind, and has hung several parts of his
house with the trophies of his former labors. The walls
of his great hall are covered with the horns of several kinds
of, deer that he has killed in the chase, which he thinks
the most valuable furniture of his house, as they afford
him frequent topics of discourse, and show that he has
not been idle.
8. At the lower end of the hall is a large otter's skin
stuffed with hay, which his mother ordered-to be hung up
in that manner, and the knight looks upon it with great
satisfaction, because it seems he was but nine years old
when Ihis dog killed it. A little room adjoining to the
hall is a kind of arlsenal, filled with guns of several sizes
and inveitions, with which the knight lhas made great havoc
in the woods, and destroyed many thousands of pheasants,
partridges and woodcccks. His stable-doors are patched
with noses that belonged to foxes of the knight's own
hu'nting dowvn.
9. Sir Roger shewed me one of them that, for distincsion sake, has a brass nail stuck through it, which cost
him about fifteen hours ridinlg, carried hhin threugh hlfand English Teacher's Assistant.     49
a dozen counties, killed him a brace of geldings, and lost
about half his dogs.'This the knight looks upon as one
of the greatest exploits of his life.
10. The perverse widow, whom I have given some accolunt of, was the death of several foxes; for Sir Ro,ser
has told me, that in the course of his amours he patched
the western door of his stable. WVhenever the widow
was cruel, the foxes were sure to pay for it. In proportion as his passion for the widow abated and old age came
on, he left off fox-hunting; but a hare is not yet safe that
sits withiin ten miles of his house.
11. There is no kind of exercise which I would so recommend to my readers of both sexes as that of riding,
as there is none which so much conduces to health, and
is every way accommodated to the body, according to the
idea which I have given of it. Dr. Sydenhanm is very lavish in its praise; and if the Englishz reader Nvill see the
mechanical effects of it described at length, he may find
them  in a book published not many years since, under
the title of Jledicina Gyz7nastica.
12. For my own part, when I am in town, for want of
these opportunities, I exercise myself an hour every
morning upon a dumb bell that is placed in a corner of
my room, and pleases me the more because it does every
thing I require in the most profound silence. My landlady and her daughters are so well acquainted with my
hours of exercise, that they never come into my room
to disturb me whilst I am ringing.
13. WVhen I was some yearls younger than I am at present, I used to employ myself in a more laborious diversion, which I learned from a Latin treatise of exercise,
that is written with great erudition: It is there called the
Skimachia, or the fighting with a man's own shadow, and
consists in t se brandishing of two short sticks grasped in
each hand, and loaded with plugs of lead at either end.
This opens the chest, exercises the limbs, and gives a
mah all tihe pleasure of boxing, without the blows.
14. I could wish that several learned menl would lay
out that time which they employ in controversies, and
disputes about nothing, in this metlhod of fighting with
their own sllhadows. It might conduce very much to
evaporate the spleen, which makes them uneasy-to the
public as well aa to thenCselves.5O    The Young Gentleman and Lady's Monitor,
As I am a compound of soul and body, I consider myself as obliged to a double scheme of duties; and think I
have not fiulfilled the business of the day when I do not
thus employ the one in labour and exercise, as well as
the other in study and conlteinplation.
15. TIhere is a story in the.Jrabian Azighhts Ttles, of a
king who had long languished under an ill habit of lody,
and had taken abundance of remedies to no purpose. At
length, says the fable, a plihysician cured Ihim by the following method: He took an hollow ball of wood, and
filled it with se-eral drugs; after wliich lie closed it up
so artificially that nothing appeared. lie likewise took
a mall, and after lhaving hollowed the handle, and that
part which strikes the ball, inclosed in them several drugs
after the same manner as in the ball itself.
16. He then ordered the sultan who was his patient, to
exercise himself early in the morning witll these rightly
prepared instlruments, till suLch time as he should swe-cat;
when, as the story goes, the virtue of the medicaments
perspiring through the wood, had so good an influence
on tlhe sultan's constitution, that they cured him of an
indisposition wvhich all the compositions he had taken inwardly had not been able to remove.
17. This eastern allegory is finely coitrived to shew us
how beneficial bodily labour is to health, and that exercise
is the most effectual physic. I have described in my
hundred and fifteenth paperl, from the general structure
and mechanism of an human body, how absolutely necessary exercise is for its preservation; I shall in this place
recommend another great preservative of health, which
in many cases produces the same effects as exercise, and
may, in some measure, supply its place, where opportunities of exercise are wanting.
18. IThe preservative I am speaking of is temperance,
which has those particular advantages above all other
means of health, that it may be practised by all ranks and
conditions, at any seasoin, or in any place. It is a kind
of regimen into which every man may put himself, without interruption to business, expense of money, or loss
of time. If exercise tlhrows off all superfluities, temperance prevellts them: if exercise clears the vessels, temperance neither satiaters nor over-stra/ms them,; if exerand Engllish Teacher's Assistant.
cise raises proper ferments in the humours, and promotes
the circulation of the blood, temperance gives nature her
full play, and enables her to exert herself in all her force
and vigour: if exercise dissipates a growing distemper,
temperance starves it.
19. Physic, for the most part, is nothing else but the
substitute of exercise or temperance. Medicines are indeed absolutely necessary in acute distempers, that cannot wait the slow operations of these two great instrunments of health: but did men live in an habitual course
of exercise and temperance, there would be but little occasion for them. Accordingly we finld that those parts
of the world are the most healthy, where they subsist by
the chace; and that men lived longest when their lives
were employed in thunting, and when they had little food
besides what they caught.
20. Blistering, cupping, bleeding, are seldom of use to
any but the idle and intemperate; as all those inward applications, wliich are so much in practice among us, are,
for the most part, nothing else but expedients to make
luxury consistent with health. The apothecary is perpetually employed in countermining thle cook and the viiltner. It is said of Diogenes, that meeting a young man
who was going to a feast, he took him up in the street, and
carried him home to his friends, as one who was running
into imminent danger, had he not prevented him.
21. WVhat would that philosopher have said, had he been
present at the gluttony of a modern meal? Woould not he
have thougllt the master of the family mad, and have begged his servant to tie down his hands, had he seen him
devour fowl, fishl and flesh; swallow oil and vinegar, wines
and spices; throw doNvn sallads of twenty different herbs,
sauces of an hundred ingredients, confections and fruits of
numberless sweets and flavours? What unnatural motions
and counter-ferments must such amedley of intemperance
produce in the body? For my part, when I behold a fashionable table set out in all its magnificence, I fancy, that I
see gouts and dropsies, fevers and lethargies,'with other
innumerable distempers, lyiig in ambuscade among the
dishes.
22. Nature delights in the most plain and simple diet.
lvery animal but man keeps to one dish. Herbs are the
512-2    The Young Gentleman anzd Lady's Monitor,.food of this species, fish of that, and flesh of a third.'Man
falls upon every thing that comes in Ihis way; not the
smallest fruit or excrescence of the earth, scarce a berry,
or a mushroom can escape him.
Itis impossible to lay down any determinate rule for
temperance, because what is luxury in one may be temperance in another; but there are few that have live(l any
time in the worlld, who are not judges of their ovwn constitutions, so far as to know what kinds and what proportions of food do best agree with them.
23. Were I to consider imy readers as my patients, and
to prescribe such a kind of temperance as is accommodated to all persons, and such as is particularly suitable to ouri
climate and way of living, I would copy the following rules
of a very eminent physician. Make your whole repast
out of one dish. If you indulge in a second, avoid drinking any thing strong till you have finished yotir meal:
at the same time abstain firom all sauces, or at least such
as are not tlhe most plainl and simnple.
24. A mnan could not be well guilty of gluttony, if he
stucl to these few obvious and easy rules. In the first
case, there would be Ino variety of tastes to solicit his palate and occasion excess; nor in the second, any artificial
provocatives to relieve satiety, and create a false appetite.
Were I to prescribe a rule for drinking, it should be
formed on a saying quoted by Sir iWilliam Tein/de:-The
first glass for myself, the secondfor myfriends, the thirdfor
good humour, and the fourth for my enemies. But because
it is impossible for one who lives in the world to diet himnself always in so philosophical a manner, I think every
nan should have his (lays of abstinence, according as his
constitution will permit.
25. These are great reliefs to nature, as they clualify
her for struggling with hunger and thirst, whenever any
distemper or duty of life may put her upon such difficulties;
and at the same time give her an opportunity of extricating herself from her oppressions,and recovering the several tones and springs of her distended vessels. Besides
that, abstinence well-timned often kills a sickness in ems
bryo, and destroys the first seeds of an indisposition.

ages, and has been celebrated at different times by such
eminent hands; I say, notwitlistanding that he lived in the
time of this devouring pestilence, he never caught the least
infection, which those writers uinanimously ascribe to that
uninterrupted temperance whichl he alwsys observed.
27. And here I cannot but mention an observation
which I have often made, upon reacling the lives of the
philosophers, and comparing them vith any series of kings
or great men of the same number. If we consider these ancient sages, a great part of whose philnsoplhy consisted in
a temperate and abstemious course of life, one would
think the life of a philosopher and the life of a man were
of two different dates. For we find that the generality of
these wise men wvere nearer an hundred than sixty years
of age at the time of their respective deaths.
28. But the most remarkable instance of the efficacy
oi temperance towards the prozuring of lon g life, is what
we meet withl in a little book publishecd by Lewis Cornaro,
the Venctiatn; vwhich I the rather mention, because it is of
undoubted credit, as the late Venetian alnbassador, who
wsv of the same -family, attested more than once in conversation, whenl he resid(ed in Englcand.  Cornaro, who was
the author of the little treatise I amn mentioning, was of an
infirm constitution, till about forty, when, by obstinately
peirsisting in an exact course of temperance, he recovere(l
a perfect state of health; insomuchl that at fourscore he
published his book, which has been translated into Enng,lish,
under the title of, Sure and certain methods of attainizng a
lontg and healthy Life.
29. He lived to give a third or1' fourth edition of it, and
after having passed his hundredth year, died without pain
or agony, and like one who falls asleep. The treatise I
inention has been taken notice of by several eminent authors, and is -written with such a spirit of cheerfulness,
religion and good sense, as are the natural concomitants
of temperance and sobriety. The mrixture of the old man
in it is rather a rcommendation than a discredit to it.

THE, EDITOR.54    The Young Gentleman and Lady's -Monitor,
who had violated the laws of secrecy: for they thought that,
however he might be deficient in the qualities requisite to
actual excellence, the negative virtues at least welre always
in his power, and though he perhaps could not speak well
if he was to try, it was still easy for him not to speak.
2. In this opinion of the easiness of secrecy, they seem
to have considered it as opposed, not to treachery, but loquacity, and to have conceived the mnan, whoml they thus
censured, not firighted by menaces to reveal, orI bribed by
promises to betray, but incited by the mere pleasure of
talking, or some other motive equally trivial, to lay open
his heart with reflection, and to let whatever he knew
slip from him, only for want of power to retain it.
3. XVhether, by their settled and avowed scorn of
thoughtless talkers, the Peer'ians were able to diffuse to
any great extent, the virtue oftaciturnity, we are hindered
by the distress of those times from being able to discover,
there being very few mnempoirs remaining of the court of
Perseiolis, nor any distinct accounts handed down to us of
their office-clerks, their ladies of the bed-chamber, their
attornies, their chamber-maids, or the footmen.
4. In these latter ages, thorugh the old animesity against
a prattler is still retained, it appears wholly to have lost its
effects upon the conduct of mankind; for secrets are so
seldom kept, that it may with some reason be doubted,
whether the ancients were not mistaken in their first postulate, whether the quality of retention be so generally bestowed, and whether a secret has not somie subtile volatility,by which it escapes almost imperceptibly at the smallest
vent; or some power of fermentation, by which it exIpands
itself so as to burst the heart that will not give it way.
5. Those that study either the body or the miiad of man,
very often find the most specious and pleasing theory fa11ing under the weight of contrary experience: and instead
of gratifying their vanity by inferring effects from causes,
they are always reduced at last to conjecture causes from
effects. That it is easy to be secret, the speculatist call
demonstrate in his retreat, and theref0fe thinks himself
justified in placing confidence: the man of the world
knows, that. wllther diflicult or not, it is not uncommlen,
and therefore finl:s himself rather inclined to search after
the reason of this timivcrsal failure in one of the rwost important duties of society.~Pnd tngZlislr Teachees Assistant.    55
5. The vanity of being known' to be truste(l with a seeret is generally one of the chief motives to disclose it;
for however absurd it may be thought to boast an honour,
by an act that shews that it was conferred without mcrit,
yet most men seem rather inclined to confess the wvaint of
virtue than of importance, and more willingly shewv their
influence and their powver, though at the expence of their
probity, than glide through life with no other pleasure
than the private consciousness of fidelity: whichl, while
it is preserved, must be withoutpraise, except frolnthe silngle person who tries andi knowvs it.
7. There aie many ways of telling a secret, by which a
man exempts himself from the reproaclles of his conscience, and gratifies his pride without suffering himlself
to believe tl at he inlpairs his virtue. He tells the private
affairs of his patron or his friend, only to those fronm
whom he would not conceal his own; he tells them to
those lwho have no temptation to betray their trust, or
%with the denunciation of a certain forfeiture of hlis friendship, if he discovers that they beconie public.
8. Secrets are very fiequently told in the first ardour
of kindness, or of love, fol the sake of proving by so important a sacrifice, the sincerity of profess;ions, or the
warmth of tenderness; but Awith this motive, though it
be sometimes stron.g in itself, vanity generally concurs,
since every man naturally clesires to be most esteemed
by those whom he loves, or whom ]le converses, with
whom he passes his hours of pleasure, and to vwhoim he
retires from business and fronm care.
9. When the discovery of secrets is under consideration,
there is always a distinction carefully to be made betveen
our own and those of anothler, those of which Nwe are fully
masters as they affect only our own interest, and those
whicji are deposited with us in trust, and involve the happiness or convenience of such as we have no right to expose to hazard by experiments upon their lives, withiout
their consent. To tell our own secrets is generally folly,
but that folly is without guilt; to communicate those wii'
which we are entrusted is always treachery, xand treachery
for the most palt combined with folly.

of Titizus is nothing more than an opinionl which:  h imsel f

14. All the arguments upon which a man who is telling
the private affairs of another may grqund hlis confidcnce in
security, he must upon reflection know to xbe uncertain, because he finds them wvithout effect upon himself.  Vhe,n
he is iltg;i-ing that- Titiis wiill be cautious fi.om a regard
to his interest, his reputation, or his duty, lie ought to reflect that he is himself at that instant acting in opposition
to all these reasons, and revealing what interest, repu.tatio
and duty direct him to conceal.
1 s. Every 9ne feels that he should consider the man incapable of trust, who believed himself at-liberty to tell
whatever he knew to the first whbm he should conclude deserving of his confidence: therefore Caius,in admitting Titizus to the affairs imparted only to himself, violates his faith,s
since he acts contrarpto the intention of Claudius,to whom
that faith was given. For promises of friendship are, like
till others, useless and vain, unless they are made in some
k-iown sense, adjusted and acknowledged by both parties.
16.1 am not ignorant that many questitQs-may be started
relating to-the duty of secrecy,where the affairs are.of publicconcern; where subsequent reasons may arise to alter the appearance and nature of the trust; that the manner in which the secret was told may change the degree of
obligation; and that the principles upon which a man is
chosen for a confidant may.not always equally constraiir
17. But. these scruples, if not too intricatei are of too
extensive consideration for my present purpose, nor are
they such as generally occur in common life;-and thougli
casuistical knowledge b-e useftul in proper hands, yet it
ought by no means to be carelessly exposed, since most
will use it rather to lull than awaken their own consciences-; and the threads of reasoning, on which truth is suspended, are frequently drawim to such subtility, that common eyes cannot perceive, and common sensibility cannot
feel them.
1 S. The whoke doctrine as well as practice of secrecy is
so perplexing and dangerots, that, next to: 1i-m'who is&amp;
compelled to trust, I tkhink him unhappy who is chosen to.
be trusted; for he is often involved in scruples without the
liberty-of calling in the J!elp of any other understanding;
he is frequently drawn in,to gult, under the appearance ofSt     7/ic toting Gentlenmn and Lady's Monitor,
friendship and honesty; and sometimes subjected to sflspicion by the treachery of others, who are engaged withount his knowledge in the same schemnes; for he that has
one confidant has generally more, and when he is at last
betrayed, is in doubt on whom -he shall fix the crime.
19. The rules therefore that I shall propose concerning
secrecTy and from which I think it not safe to deviate,
without long and exact deliberation, are-never to solicit
the knowledge of a secret. Not willingly nor without any
limitations, to accept such confidence when it is offered.
When a secret is once admitted, to consider the trust as of
a very high nature,. important to society, and sacred as
truth, and thetefore not to be violated for any incidental
convenience, or slight appearance of contrary fitness.
Of Cileerfulness.
1. 1 HAVE always preferred cheerfulness to mirth.
The latter I consider as an act, the former as a habit Qf
the mind. Mirth is short and transient, dheerfuilHnds,fixed
and permanent. Those are often raised into the greatest
transports of mirthl, who are tubject to the greatest depressions of melancholy; on the contrary, cheerfulness,
though it does not give the mind such an exquisite gladness, prevents usfrom falling into any depths of sorrow.
Mlirth is like a flash of lightning that breaks through a
gloom of clouds, and glitters fior a moment; cheerfulness
keeps -up a kind of day-light in the mind, and fills'it with
a steady and perpetual serenity.
2. Men of austere principles look upon mirth as too
wanton and dissolute for a state of probation, and as filled
with a certain triumph and insolence of heart that is inconsistent with a life which is every momrent obnoxious to the
greatest dangers. \Writers of this complexion have observed, that the sacred person who was the great pattern
of perfection, was never seen to laugh.:3. Cheerfulness of mind is not liable to- any of these
exceptions; it is of a serious and composed nature; it
does not throw the mind into a condition improper for the,preseent state of humanity, and is very conspicuous in the.characters of those wlho are looked upon as the greatest
philosophers among the heathens, as well as among thoseCad~',L2,Gis, Teacher's Assistant.   59
wvho have been dese-rvedly esteemed as saints and v-oly
men among christians.
4. If we consider clheerfulness in three lights, with regard to ourselves, to those wve converse with, and to the
-great Author of our being, it will not a little recommend
itself on each of these accounts. The man who is in posses-'sion of this excellent firame of mind, is not onlr easy in hi s
thoughts, but a perfect master of all the powers and facuities of the soul:.his imagination is always clear, and lis.judgment uldisturbedl:  his temper is even and unruffled,
v, hlether in action or solitude. He comes with a relish to
all those goods which nlxture has provided for him, tastes
all tile pl1s,sures of the creation which are ipoured aboutt
himi, and does not f-eel the futill weight of those,accidental
evils which mnay befal him.. If vwe consider him in relation to the persons whlom
1he2 converses with, it naturally produces love and good
w-ill towards him. A cheerful min(l is not onlyl disposed to
be affable, and obliging, but raises the same gzoodi hlmumour
in those wiho come within its inf'uencc. -.A iai findTs

peslon who has so kindly an effect upon it.
6. When I consider this cheerful state of mind in its
tlirld reIlti'on, I cAnnot but lo;o,,upon it as,c q9nstan.t labitual gratitude to the. great Author of Nature. An in-ward cheerfulness is an implicit praise a ud thanksjiving
to Providelnce under all its dispensations. It is a ~iid, of
-cquvisqence in the state whereinv we are placed, and: a
secret approbation of the Divine will in -his condur'ct towarls magn.
7. There are but two thing! wvhich, in my opinion, car.
reasoinaalydeprive us-of -thjis.eerJqlness otllea.rt.  The
first.of these is the sense of guilt. A man:ho0 lives in ut

lai-, iage can fturiish us wvith, and is many degrees beyond
Whlat we commonly call folly or madness.
8. Atheism, by which I mean a disbelief of a Supreme
Being, and consequently of a future state, under whatsoever title it shelters itself, may likevise very reasonably
deprive a man of this cheerfulness of temper. There is
something so particularly gloomy and offenswive to human
nature in the prospect of non-existence, that I cannot but
wonder, with many excellent writers, how it is possible
for a man to out-live the expectation of it. For my own
part, I think the being of a God is so little to be doubted,
that it is.almost the only truth we are sure of, and such a
truth as we meet with in every object, in every occurrence, and in every thought.
9. If we look into the characters of this tribe of infidels,
we generally find they are made up of pride, spleen and
cavil: It is indeed no wonder that men, who are uneasy
to themselves, should be so to the rest of the world; and
how is it possible for a man to be otherwise than uneasy
in himself, who is in danger evei$ moment of losing his
entire existence, and dropping into nothing?
10. The vicious man and atheist have therefore no pretence to cheerfulness, and would act very unreasonably,
should they endeavor after it. It is impossible for any one
to live in good humour, and enjoy his present existence,
wvho is apprehensive either of torment or of annihilation;
of being miserable, or of not being at all.
After having nmentioned these two great principles,
which are destructive of cheerfulness in their own nature,
as well as in right reason, I cannot thiik of any other:that ought to banish this happy temper from a virtuous
mind. Pain and sicktiess, shame and reproach, poverty
and old age, nay, death itself, considering the shortness
of their duration, and the advantage we may reap from
them, do nbt deserve the name of evils.
11. A good mind may bear up under them with fortitude, with indolence, and with cheerfulness of heart-the
tossing of a tempest does not discompose him, which he
is sure will bring him to a joyful harbour.
A man who uses his best endeavours to live according
tothe dictates of virtue and right reason,'has two perpetual sources of cheerfulness, in the consideration of hisand ELTglighi Teacher's AssMitant.  61
own nature, and of that Being on whom he has a dependence.
12. If he looks into himself, he cannot but rejoice in that
existence, which is so lately bestowed upon him, and
which, after millions of ages, will still be new, and still in
its beginning. How many self-congratulations naturally
arise in the mind, when it reflects on this its enirance
into eternity, when it tales a view of those improveable
faculties, which in a few years, and even at its first setting out, have made so considerable a progress, and which
will be still receiving: an inclease of perfection, and consequently an inclrease of happiness?
13. The consciousness of such a being spreads, a perpetual diffusion of joy through the soul of a virtuous manr
and makes him look upon himself every moment as more
happy than he knows how to conceive.
The second source of cheerfufness to a good mind is,
its consideration of that Being on wlhom we have our dependence, and in whom, though we behold hinfras yet
but in the first faint discoveries of his perfections, we see
every thing that we can imagine as great, glorious, or
amiable. IWe find ourselves every where upheld by' his
goodness, and surrounded by an immensity of love and
mercy.
14. In short,.we depend upon a Being, whose power
qualifies him to make us happy by an inllfiity of means,
whose goodness and truth engage him to make those happy who desire it of him, and whose unchangeableness
will secure us in this happiness to all eternity.
Such considerations, which every one should perpetually cherish in his thoughts, will banish from us all that
secret heaviness of heart which unthinking men are subJect to when they lie under no real affliction, all that anguish which we may feel from any evil that actually oppresses u%, to which I may likewise add those. little cracklings of mirth and folly, that are apter to betray virtue
than support it; and establish ifi us such an even and
cheerful temper, as makes us pleasing to ourselves, to
those with whom we converse, and to him whom we are
made to please.62    TzTe Ycv:g Ge.lePmnzan and Ladgy's MiXonitor,

1. CHEERFULNESS is il the first place tthe best
promoter of health. Repining and secret murinurs of
heart.give imperceptible strokes to those delicate fibres
of wlhich the vital parts are composed, and wear out the
mTni-*ine inses ibly; not to mention those violent fernients
yliiCh they stir up in the blood, and those irregulari disiiafrbpd lotions, W1hich they raise in the animal spirits.
2. I scarce remember in my own observ-ation, to have
met with many old men, or Ywith Such, who (fto use. our
Engtli.ah phrase) vwere well, that had nlot at least a certain
indolence in their.'humour, if not a more than ordinalry.fli.ty arid cheerfilness of heart.  The truthl of it is,
hiealth'and cheerfiulness lmutually beget each other; W-ithl
this difference, that we seldom meet with a great degree
of health  which is not a,ttended with a certtin cheerfulness, but very often see cheerfulness where there is no
o.'reat degi'ee of-iiealth.
3. Cheerfulness bears the same friendly regard to the
mind as to the lbody: it binishes all anxious care and discontent, -soothes anld composes the'passionrs, and keeps
the sbul in a perpetual calm. But, having alieady touched
on this last consideration, I shall lere take.notice, that th,
morld iin which we are placed is filled with innumerable
ohJects that are proper to raise and keep alive this happy
temper o mind.
4. It we consider thle world in its subserviency to man,
one would think it was made: for our use; but if we consider it in' its -natural beauty and harmony, one ould be.pt to conciude it was made for our pleasure. The sun,'vhich is as thie great soul of the.universe, and produces all
the necessaries of life, has a particular influence in cheering the mind of man; -and making the heart glad.
5. Those several living.creatures which are made for
our service or sustenance, at the same time either fill the
woods witl their music, furnish us with game, or raise
pleasirig ideas in us by the delightfulness of tlheir apiea-ance. Fountlaifis, lakes and iilvers, are as refreshiing
to the imaginhtion as to the soul through Wihich they pass.
T, There wre \.v iters of g6reat distinctionl, yho LavrIand E~ngitsh Teacher's Assistant.  6
made it an argument for Providence, that the whole earth
is -covered with green, rather thari with any other colour,
as being such a right mixture of light and shade, that it
comforts and strengthens the eye instead of weakening or
grieving it. For this reason several painters have a
green cloth hanging near them, to ease the eye upon after
too great an application to their colouring.
7. A famous modern philosopher accounts for it in the
following manner:-All colours that are more luminous,
overpower and dissipate the animal spirits which are employed in sight: on the contrary, those tha/t are more obscure do not give the animal spirits a sufficient exercise;
whereas the rays that produce in us the idea of green, fall
upon the eye in such a due proportion, that they give the
animal spirits their poper play, and by keeping up the
struggle in a just balance, excite a very agreeable and pleasing sensation. Let the cause be what it will, the effect is
certain; for which reason, the poets ascribe to this particular colour the epithet of cheerful.
8. To consider further this double end in the works of
nature, and how they are, at the same time, both usefull
and entertaining, we find that the most important parts ira
the vegetable world are those which arle the most beautiful.
These are the seeds by which the several races of plants
are propagated and continued, and which are always lodged
in flowers or blossoms. Nature seems to hide her principal
design, and to be industrious in making theearth gay and
delightfui, while she is carrying on her great work, and
intent upon her own preservationr. The husbandman, after the same manner, is employed in laying out the whole
courttry into a kind of garden or landscape, and making
every thing smile 4bout hirhm, whilst, in reality, he thinks
of nothing but of the harvest and increase which is to arise:
from it.
9. WVe may further observe how Providence has taken
care to keep up this cheerfulnessin the minid of man, by
having formed it after such a manner, as to make it capable of conceiving delightfrom several objects whiich seem
to have very little use in them; as froml. the wildness of
rocks and deserts, and the like grotesque parts of nature.
Those who are versed in philosophy may still carry this
eonsideration higher by observing, that, if matter had apYOUNG GENTLEMAN

Pursuit of Knowledge recommended to r'ozth.
1. I AM  very much concerned when I see young
gentlemen of fortune and quality so wholly set upon
pleasure and diversions, that they neglect all those
improvements in wisdom   and knowledge which may
make them easy to themselves and useful to the world.
The greatest part of our British youth lose their figure,
and grow out of fashion, by that time they are five and
twenty.
2. As soon as the natural gaiety and amiableness of
the young man wears off, they have nothing left to recommend them, but lie by the rest of their lives, among
the lumber and refuse of the species.
It sometimes happens indeed, that for want of apply.
ing themselves in due time to the pursuits of knowledge,
they take up a book in their declining years, and grow
very hopeful scholars by that time they are threescore.
I must therefore earnestly press my readers who are in
the flower of their youth, to labour at these accomplishments which may set off their persons when their bloom
is gone, and to lay in timely provisions for manhood and
old age. In short, I would advise the youth of fifteen
to be dressing up every day the man of fifty; or to
consider how to make himself venerable at threescore.

do well to observe how the greatest men of antiquity

Disc -et;oT.
1. I HTtAVE often thoughLit if -the minds, or men were
laid open, we should see hut Ettle difle-rence between that
of the wise man andl that of the fool. There are infinite
reveries, numberless extrav,--arancies, and a perpetual train
oi vanities, which pass throulgh both. The great difflrence
is, that the first knows how to pick and cull his thoughts
for conversation, by suppressing some, and communicatinn others; whereas the other lets them all indifferentlv
fly otut in words. This soIrt of discretion; howe ver, has
no place in private converlsation between intimate friends.
()n stuch occasions the wisest men very often talk like
tht weakest; for indeed the talking with a-friehd is nothing else, but thinking aloud.
2. Tutlly has therefore very justly exposed aprecept delivered-by some ancient writers, that a -man should live
%with his enemy in such a manner, as might leave him room
to become his friend; and with his friend in such a mannel; tha.t if he bectae his enemy, it should not be in his66     7YThe Young Genttleman and Lady's Monitor,
power to hurt him. The first part of this rule, which regards our behaviour towards an enemy, is indeed very
reasonable, as well as prudential but the latter part of
it, which regards our behaviour towards a friend, favours
more of cunning than of discretion, and would cut a man
off from the greatest pleasures of life, which are the freedoms of converlsation with a bosom friend. Besides, that
when a-friend is turned into an enemy, and (as the son of
Sirach calls him) a betrayer of secrets, the world is just
enough to accuse the perfidiousness of the friend, rather
than the indiscretion of the person who confided in him.
$. Discretiondoes not only shew itself in words, but in
all the circumstances of action; and is like an under-agent
of Providence, to guide and direct us in the ordinary concerns of life.
There are many more shining qualities in the mind of
man, but there is none so useful as discretion; it is this indeed which gives a value to all the rest, which sets them at
work in their proper times and places, and tt,rns them to
the advantage of the person who is possessed of them.
Withdout it, learning is pedantry, and wit impertinence;
virtue itself looks like weakness; the best parts only qualify a man to be more sprightly in errors, and active to his
own prejudice.
4. Nor -does discretion only make a man the master of
his owlh parts, but of other men's. The discreet man
finds out the talents of those he converses with, and
knows how to apply them to proper uses. Accordingly,
if we look ixito particular communities and divisions-of
men, we may observe, that it is the discreet man, not
the witty, nor the learned, nor the brave, who guides thz
conversation, and gives measures to the society. A man
with great talents, but void of discretion, is like PolyJlhemus in the fable, strong and blind, endued with an irresistibk force, which for want of sight, is of no use to him.
5. Though a man has, all other perfections, and wauts
discretion, he will be of no great consequence in the world
but if he has this single talent in perfection and but a common share of others, he may do what he pleases in his
station-of life.
At the same time that I think discretion the most useful
talent aman can be master of, I lookupor cunning to be theand English Teacher's Assistant.      67
accomplishment of little, mean, ungenerous minds. Discretion points out the noblest enlds to us, and pursues the
mostproper and laudable methods of attaining them; cunning has only private selfish aims, and sticks at nothing
which may make them succeed.
6. Discretion has large and extentled views, and, like a
well foirmed eye, commands a whole horizoni: cunning is
a kind of short-sightedness, that discovers the minutest
objects which are near at hand, but is not able to discern
things at a distance. Discretion, the more it is discoveredi, gives a greater authority'tothe person who possesses
it; cunning, when -it is once dtetected, loses its force, and
makes a man incapable ofbringing'aboht eventhose events
which he might have done, had he pas~ed fIy for a plain
man. Discretion is tile perfection of reason,-'and a guide
to us in all the duties of lif:e; cunning isa kind of instinct,
that only looks out after ourimmedis.e interest and welfare.
7. Discretion is only founld inmefni-strong sense and
good understandings: cunning is often to be met withl in
brutes themselves, and in persons who are but-the fewest
removes from them. In short, cunning is only the mimic
of discretion, and may pass upon weak men, in the same
manner as vivacity is often mistaken for wit, and grarity
for wis(loln.
The cast of nind whlich is natural to a discreet man,
makes him look forward into futurity, and consider wh.at
wrill be his condition Imillions of ages hence, as well as Nwhat
it is at present.
8. IH-e knows, that the misery or happiness which are
reserved for him in another world, lose nothin-g oi their
reality tby beinog placed at so great a distance fiom him.
The objects do not appear- little to himbecause they are renote,  lie co:lsiiers that those pleasures and pains whichi
lie hid in eternit,, appro?2ch nearer to him every moment,
andti ill be present Awith him in their full weigh: and me,sure, as m-ich -as thlose pains and pleasures wnich lie feels
at this veiy instant. For this reason he is careful to secure to himself thant which is the proper happiness of his
nature, ancl the ultimat.e desiign of his being.
9. He carries his tlhoughts to the end of every action,
and considers the most distant as well as the most irnmediate effects of it. He supercedes every little prospect
G68     The Young Gentleman and Lady's Monitor~
of gain and advantage which offers itself here, if he does
not find it consistent with his views, of an here'after. In
a word, his hopes are full of immortality, his schemes
are large and glorious, and his conduct suitable to one
whlio knows his true interest, and how to pursue it by proper methods.
10. Iha\ve, in this essay upon discretion, considered it
both as an accomplishment anld as a virtue, and have therefore described it in its ftll extent; Inot only as it is conversant about worldly affairs, but as it regards our vwhole
existence; not only as it is the guide of a mortal creature, but as it is in general the director of a reasonable
being. - It is in this light that discretion is represented by
the wise man, who sometimes mentions it tiunder the name
of discretion, and sometimes under that of wisdom.
11. It is indeed (as described in the latter part of this
paper) the greatest wisdom  bnit at the same time in the
power of every one-to attain. Its advantages are infirni-e,
but its acquisition easy; &amp;t, to speak of her in the words
of the apocryphal writer, " l isdomn is glorious, and never
" fadeth away, yet she is easily seen of theni that love
" her, anld fouind of such as seek her.
12. 4" She preventeth them that desire her, in rmaking
" herself first known unto them. He that seeketh hiei'
" eatly, shall have no great travel: for he shall find her
" sitting at his doors. To think, therefore, upon her, is
" perfection of wisdom, and whoso watcheth for her, shall
" quickly be without care. For she goeth about seekirng
" such as are worthy of her, sheweth herself favourailbv
" unto thein in the ways, and mepteth them in every'" thought."
Pride.
1. THERE is no passion which steals into the heart
more imperceptibly, and covers itselfundermore disguises,
than pride. For my own part, I think, if there is any
passion or vice which I am wholly a stranger to, it is this;
tho,ugh at the same time, perhaps this very judgment.
wi.id11 I formn of myself, proqeeds in some me; sure from

sentence in holy writ, Prid-e was not made for man. There
is not, indeed, any single view of humanl nature under its
present condition, which is not sufficiont to extinguish in
us all the secret seeds of pride; and, on tle contrary, to
sink the soul into the lowest state of hunlility, and what
the school-men call self-annihilation. Pride wvas not made
for man, as he is,
I. A sinful,
2. An ignorant,
3. A miserable being.
There is nothing in his understanding, in his will, or
in his present condition, that can tLmlpt any considerate
creature to pride or vanity.
3. These three very reasons why he should not be
proud, are, notwithstainding, the reasons why he is so.
Ve:re not he a sinful creature, he would not be subject to
a passion which rises from the depravity of his nature;
were he not an ignorant creature, he would see that he
has nothing to be proud of; and were not the whole species miserable, he would not have those wretched objects
before his eyes, which are the occasions of this passion,
and which make one man value himself more than anotlier.
4. A wise man will be contelited that his glory be defelred till sulch time as he shall be -truly glorified; when
his understanding shall be cleared; his will rectified, and
his happiness assured; or, in other words, when he shall
be neither sinful, nor ignorant, nor miserable.
5. If there be any thing which makes human nature
appear ridiculous to beings of superior faculties, it must be
pride. They know so well tlle vanity of those imaginary
perfections that swell the heart of man, and of those little
supernumerary advantages, whether in birth, fortune, or
title, which one man enljoys above another, that it musx
certainly very muc'h astonish, if it does not very much divert them, when they see a mortal puffed up, and valuing
himself above his neighbours on any of these accounts,
at the same time that he is obnoxious to all the common
calamities of the species.
6. To set this thought in its true light, we will fancy,
if you please, that yonder mole-hill is inhabited by reasonable creatures, and that every pismire (his shape aad way70    T'he Young Gentleman and Lady's Monitor,
of life only excepted) is endowed with hluman passions.
Hlow should we smile to hear one give us aTn account of
the pedigrees, distinctions, and titles that reign amnoing
them!  
7. Observe how the whole swarm divide and make way
for the pismire that passes through them! You must understandi lhe is an enlmet of quality, and has better blood
in his veins than any pismire in the mole-hill.-Don't vou
se%e how sensible he is of it, how slow he marchies iorward, how'lle whlole rabble of ants keep their distance?
8. I-Iere yoiu may obser-e one placed upon a little eminence, and looking down upon a ilong row of labourers.
He is the richest inisect on this side thie killock, he has a
-waik of half a yard in length, and a quarter of an inch in
breacdth, lie ke;s a hundred menial servants, and has at
least fifteen b;rlcy-corns in his granarv. Hle is now chiding and bcsiavig, the emmet that stands before him, and
whIlo, for a!l that iwe can discover, is as good an emmet
as hinlself.
9. blEt here comes an insect of figure! don't you take
notice oi' a little white straw that he carries in his moot th?
That straw, you must understand, he would not part with
for thle ionrgest tract about the mole-hill: did you but know
what lie has undergoSne to pulrchase it! See how the ants
of all quadities and conditions swarm about hi:1! Should
this st,:aw drop ou.t of his 1mouth, you would see all this
luimcei-o13 circle of attendants foliov t.he nIex't that took it
tup, and lve Lthe disCIa-rded insect, olr run ovier his back
to co'e a  hia  s succC:soro
10. If nowv you h;ave a mind to see all the ladies of the
mole-hill, observe first the ptismii'e that listens to the cmnmet on her left hand, at the sarne time that sthe st.lcms
to turn away her h-ad friom hnim.  ie tells this poor insect that she is a gocide  s, thlat her eyes are bri,ghter than
the s-unl that life and dit-atlh are at her disposal. She berieves hlim, and gives herscelf a thousand little air's upon it,
11. MAlark the vanity of the pismnire on yotLu left iand.
She can scarce crawl with age; but you must know she
values herself upon her birth; and if you' mind, spurns
at every one tlhat comes within her reach. The littld
nimble coquette that is running along by the side of her,
is a wit. She has broke many a pismire's heart. Do but
observe whiat a drove of lovers are ruaming after hbr,.(ad Engllish Teacher's Assistant.   71
12. We will here finish this imaginary scene; buit first
of all, to draw the parallel closer, will suppose, if you
please, that death comes down upbn the mole-hill in the
shape of a cock-sparrow, who picks up without distinction, the pismire of quality and his flatterers, thle pismire
of substance and his day labourers, the white straw officer
and his sycophants, with all the goddesses, wits, and beauties of the mole-hill.
13. May we not imagine that beings of superior natures and perfections regard all the instances of pr;ide and
vanity, among our own species, in the same kind of view,
vhen they take a survey of those who inhabit the earth;
or, in the language of an ingenious French poet, of those
pisnmires thiat people this heap of dirt, which human vanity
has divided into climates and regions.
GUARDIAN, Vol. II. No. 153.
Drunken;l.;S.
1. NO vices are so incurable as thlose which men are
apt to glory in. One would wonder how drunkenness
slhould have the good luck to be of this number..tnarciarsis, being invited to a match of drinking at Corinth,
demanded the prize very humourously, because he was
drunk before any of the rest of the company, for, says he,
when we run a race, he who arrives at the goal first, is
entitled to the reward:
2. Or, the contrary, in this thirsty generation, the lhonour falls upon him who carries off the greatest quantity
of liquor, and knocks down the rest of the company. I
was the other day with honest Wirill Funnell, the West
Saxon, who was reckoning up how much liquorhad passed
through him in the last twenty years of his life, which,
according to his computation, amounted to twenty-three
hogsheads of October, four ton of port, half a kilderkia
of small-beer, nineteen barrels of cyder, and three glasses
of champaigne; besides which he had assisted at fo\ur
hundred bowls of punch,- not to mention sips, drams, and
whets without nulmlber.
3. I question not but every reader's memory will suggest to WAin several ambitious young men) wvho are as
G 272    The Young Gn'entlemr acnd Lady's Monrtor)
vain in this particular as Will Fiunnzell, and can boast of a'
glorious exploits.
Our modern philos.phers observe, -that there is a general decay of moisture in the globe of the earth. This
they chiefly ascribe to the growth of vegetalbles, which
incorporate into their own substance many fluid bodies
that never return again to their former nature:
4. But with subnmission, they ought to throw into thc l'
account, those innumerable rational beings which fetch
their nourishment chiefly out of liquids: especially when
we consider that meii, compared with their fellow-crcatures, drink much more than comes to their share.
5. But however higlily this tribe of people may think of
themselves, a drulnken man is a greater monster than any
that is to be found among all the creatures which God has
made; as indeed there is no character which appears
more despicable and deformed, in the eyes of all reasonable persons, than that of a drunkard.
6. Bonosue, one of our own countrymen, who was addicted to this vice, having set up for a share in the Roman
empire, and being defeated in a great battle, hanged himself. When he wvas seen by the army in this melancholy
situation, notwithstanding he had behaved himself very
bravely, the common jest was, that the thing they sawr
hanging upon the tree before them, was not a man, but a
bottle.
7. This vice has very fatal.effects on the mind, the body and fortune of the person who is devoted to it.
In regard to the mind, it first of all discovers every flaw
in it. The sober mnan, by the strength of reason, may keep
under and subdue every vice or folly to which he is most
inclined; but wine makes every -latent seed sprout up in
the soul, and shew itself: it gives fury to the passions,
and force to those objects which are apt to produce them.
S. When a young fellow complained to an old philosopher that his wife was not handsome; Put less water into
youTr wvine, says the philosopher, and you'll quickly make
her so. WVine heightens indifference into love, love into
jealousy, andi jealousy into madness. It often turns the
goi niatured manl into an idiot, and the choleric into an
assassin. It gives bitterness to resentment, it makes vanity insupportable, and displays every little spot-of the
soul in its utmost deformity.aa,!d E7g1'!isJ  Teac her's Assistant.  73  
9. Nor does this vice only betray the hiddeln faults of a
man, and shew themi in most odious colours, but ofteni
occasions faults to which he is not naturally subject.
There is more of turn than of truth in a saying of Se&amp;leca,
that drunkenness does not produce, but discover faults.
Commonl experience teaches the contrary;
10. Wiine thlrows a man out of himself, and infuses qualities into the mii.d, which she is a stranger to in her sober
moments. The person you converse with, after the thi-rd
bottle, is not the same mall who at first sat down'at the
table with you. Upon this maxim is founded one of the
prettiest sayings I e-er met with, which is inscribed to
Publius Sytrus, He wtho jests uq,on a man that is drunlk, inzjures the absc;nt.
1 1. Thus does drunkenness act in direct contradiction
to reason, whose business it is to clear the mind of every
vice which is crept into it, and to guard it against all the
approaches of any that endeavour to make its entrance.
But besides these ill effects which this vice produces in
the person whio is actually under its dominion, it has also
a bad influence on the mind, even in its sober moments, as
it insensibly weakens the understanding, impairs the memory, and makes those faults habitual which are produced
by frequent excesses: it wastes the estate, banishes reputation, consumes the body, and renders a man of the
brightest parts the common jest of an insignificant clown.
12. A method of spending one's time agreeably is a
thing so little studield, that the common amusement of our
young gentlemen (especially of such as are at a great (listance from those of the first breeding) is drinking.'his
way of enterltainment has custom on its side; but as much
as it has prevailed, I believe there have been very few
companies that have been guilty of e3icess this way, where
there have not happened more accidents which make
against, than for the continuance of it.
13. It is very common that events arise from a debauch
which are fatal, and alwaSs such as are disagireeable.
With all a man's ireason and good sense about him, his
tongue is apt to utter things out of a mere gaiety of heart,
which may displease his best friends. Who then would
trust himself to the power of wine, without saying more
against it, than that it raises the imagination and depresses
judgment?2  Th  tung- Gen,~linan and Lady's Moni,,,tor,

14. Were there only this single consideration, that we
are less masters of ourselves when we drink in thg least
proportion above t he exigencies of thirst: I say, were this
all that could be objected, it weCre sufficient to make us abhor this vice. But we may go on to say, that as he who
drinks but a little is not master of himself, so he who
drinks much is a slvve to himself.
15. As for my part. I ever csteemRed a drunkard of all
vicious persons the most -vicious: for if our actions are to
be wei-gied and considered according to the intention of
them, what can we tllink of him who puts himself into a
circumstance wherein he can have no intention at all, but
incapacitates himlself for the duties and offices of life, by
a suspeension of all his faculties.
16. If a man considers that he cannot, under the oppression ofdirink, be a firiend, a gentleman, a master, or a subject; that lie has so long banished himself from all that is
dear, and given up all thlat is sacred to him, he would even
then think of a debauch with horror; but when he looks
still further, an;d acknowledges that he is not only expelled
ouit of all thie relations of litfe, but also liable to offend
against them all, what words caln express the terrol and
detestation he would have of such a condition?  And yet
he owns all this of hilmself who says he was drunk last
night.
17. As I have all along persisted in it, that all the vicious in general alre in a state of death, so I think I may add
to the non-existence of;-runkards t'at hey dlid by their
own hands. He is certainly as gu'lty o,: suicide wi.o perishes by a slow, as he that is dispatched by an immedliate
poison.
18. In my last lucubration I proposed the general use
of water-gruel, and.hinlted that it might not be amiss at
this very season: but as thlere are some, whose cases, in
regard to their families, will not admit of del.y, I have
used my interest in several wards of the city, th..t the
wholesome restorative above-mentioned mav be given in
tavern kitchens to all the mornings draug-,it-men within
the xvalls wxven they ccll for wine before noon.
19. For a further restriaint and mark upon such persons,
I have given orders, that in all the officers where policies
are drawn upon lives, it shall be adled to the article whichand English Teacher's Assistant.      75
prohibits that the nominee should cross the sea, the words,
Provided als,) That the a(cOve-mnentioned A. B. shall not dcrink'
before dinner during the toerm mne2tionzed in thlis indenture.
20. 1 am not without hopes that by this method I shall
bring some unsizeable friends of mine into shape and
breadth, as well as others who are languid and consumptive into health and vigour. Most of the self-murderers
whom I yet hinted at, are such as preserve a certain regularity in taking- their poijon, and make it mix pretty
well with their foodk!:
21. But the most conspicuous of those who destroy
themselves? are suchi as in their youth fall into this sort
of debauchery, and contract a certain uneasiness of spirit,
which is not to be diverted but by tippling as often as t1hey
can fall into company in the day, atnd conclude with downright drunkenness at night.  These gentlemen never
know the satisfaction of youth, but skip the years of manhood, and are d6crepid soon aftelr they are of age.
22. I was godfather to one of these old fellows. He is
now three and thirty, which is the grand climacteric of a
young drunkard. I went to visit the crazy wretch this
morning, with no other purpose but to rally him, under
the pain and uneasiness of being sober.
But as our faults are double when they effect others besides ourselves, so this vice is still niore odious in a miariied than a single mi n.
23. He that is the hu.sband of a woman of honour, and
comes home overloaded with wvine, is still more contemptible, in proportion to the regard we have to the unhappy
consort of his bestiality. Tlhe imagination cannot shape
to itself any thing more monstrous ancl unnatural, thaan the
familiarities betw;een drunkennless and chastity.  The
wretched A.treal, who is the perfection of beauty and innocence, has long been thus condemned for life. The
romantic tales of virgins devoted to the jaws of monsters,
have nothing in them  so terrible, as the gift of.4.str,ea
to that bacchanal.
24. The reflection of such a match as spotless innocence
with abandoned lewdhess, is what -putts this vice in the
worst figure it can bealr with regard to others; but when
it is looked upon with respect only to the drunkardi himself, it has deformities enough to make it disagreeable,76     The Young G e0ntmrman ti-7d iar't,'s -,Ycritor,
which may be summed up in a word, by allowing, that
he who resigns his reason, is actually guilty of!l that he

S I R,
1.'AS soon as you have set up your unicorn, there is
no question but the ladies will make him push very flriously at the men; for which reason, I think it is good to
be beforeh.and with them, and mnake the rlion roal a0loud at
female irregularities. Among tle; e I wonder how their
gaming has so longi escaped your notice.
2.' You who converse.with the sober family of the' Lizardl, are, perhaps, a stranger to these viragoes; bult
w' hat would you say, should youTsee the Slparkler shaking' her elbow fo,r a wh.ole night together, and thumping the'table with a dice-box? Or how would you like to hear
the good widow lady herself returning to her house at

more than can be contained in this paper. However, that
I may proceed in method, I shall consider them, First, as
they relate to the mind; Secondly, as they relate to the
body.
4. Could we look into the mind of a female gamester,
we should see it full of nothing but trumps anld mattadores.
Her slumbers are haunted witlh kings, queens, and knaves.

11. I come in the next place to consider the ill consequences vwhich gaming has on the bodies of our female adventurers. It is so ordered, that almost every thiig whicl
corrutpts the soul decays the body. The beauties of the
face and mind are generally destroyed by the same mLeaiis.
This consideration should have a particular wei,ht withi
the female world, who are designed to pleas- the eye and
attract the regards of the other half of the species.
12. Now thlere is nothingir that wears out a fine face like
the vigils of the card table, and those cutting passions
which naturally atteud thncm. Hollowveyes, hlaggard looks,
and pale complexions, are thle natural indications of a female gamester. Her mnorning sleeps are not able to repair her midnight v watc'lings.
13. I have knowvn a woman carriiied off hlalf dead firom
bassette, and lhave many a timre grieved, to see a person of
quality gliding by rae in her chiair at twno o'clock ii ti e
jnorning, and looking like a spectre amiidst a glare oi i-l.mbeaux: in short, I never knew a thorouglh-paced feiaale
galnester hold her beauty t to winters together.
14. But there is still another case in wliich tl-,e bod y is
mnore endang-ered thlanl in the former. All play-debts m ist
be paid in specie, or by an. equivalent. The man that pl:ivs
b1eyond his income pawns his estate; the woman must find
out something else to mortgage when her pin-mone y is
gone. The husband has his lanrds to dispose of, the Nwife
her person. Now when the female boaly is once difi/zed, if
the creeditor be very importunate, I leave my reader to
cons-ider the consequences.
15. It is needless here to mention the ill conseqluences
attendinlg this passion among tile men, who are ofcen bubbled out of their raone-v and estates by sharpers, and to make
up ther loss, lhav  recourse to means prolctctive of dire

him desperate, so as to commit violence either upon himself or some other person, and therefore gaming should be
discouraged in all well regulated communities.

S I R,
1. AS the ladies are naturally become the immediate objects of your care, will you permit a complaint to be inserted in your paper, which is founded upon matter of fact?
They will pardon me, if by laying before you a particular
instance I was lately witness to of their improper behaviour, I endeavour to expose a reigning evil, which subjects them to many shameful imputations.
2. I received last week a dinner card fromn a friend, with
an intimation that I should meet some very agreeable la(lies. At my arrival, I found that the company consisted
chiefly of females, who indeed did me the honour to rise,
but quite disconcerted me in paying my respects, by their
whispering each other, alnd appearing to stifle a laugh.
When I was seated, the ladies grouped themselves up in
a corner, and entered into a private cabal, seemingly t
discourse upon points of great secrecy and importance,
but of equal merriment and dive,rsion.
3. The same conduct of keeping close to their ranlks
was observed at table, where the ladies seated themselves
together.  Their conversation was here also confined
wholly to themselves, and seemed like the mysteries of
the Bonna Deo, in which men were forbidden to have any
share. It was a continued laugh and a whisper from the
beginning to the end of dinner. A whole sentence was
scarce ever spoken aloud.
4. Single words, indeed, now and then broke forth; such
as odious, horrid, detestable, shocking, HUMBUG. This last
new-coined expression, which is only to be found in the
nonsensical vocabulary, sounds absurtl and disagreeable,
whenever it is pronounced; but from the mouth of a lady
it is, " shocking, detestable, horrible and odious."
5. My friend seemed to be in an uneasy situation at hi*
ewn table; but I was far more miserable. I was mute,
and seldom dared to lift up my eyes from my plate, or
tfua my llead to call for small beer, lest by some aukwardso    77,e Young' Cent!enzanl and Lady's MAonitor,
posture I might draw upon me a whisper or a laugoh.
S&amp;ncho, whlen hle wvas forbid to eat of a (ielicious banluct
set before him, could scarlce appear more melancholy.
6. The rueful length of my face might possibly increzase
the mirth of rmy torlllmentors: at least their joy stei ecml  to
rise in exact proportion with my misery. At length, however, tihe time of my delivery approached. D-i1ncr tensed, the ladies made their exit in pairs, and went of" lh:aind
in hand whispering li:ke the two kings of Bre;z,';rd.
7. MIodest men,,Ir. Tbowl?T, are deeply wounded when
they imagine themsolvCs tlle subjects of ridicule or cintempt; and the pain is the greater, when it is given i;y
those w-horm they admire, and from whom t-hey are anbitious of receiving any marks of countenance and fa.vour.
Yet4 we must allow, that affronts are pardonable fiom la-l
dies, as they are often progniostics of future kildnee-ss.

10. This pract: c of whispering, if it is any where al;kI-.able, may perhaps bU ind-ulgedthle fair sex at church, x he:e
the conversation cain only bl ca.rri-l on by tihe secret svnilbols Qf a curtsy, an ogle, or a nod. A whisper in this place
is very often of -great use, as it serves to convey the most
secret intelligence, nwhich a lady wrould be read}y to burst
with, if she could not find vent for it by this kind of atnricular confession. A piece of scandal tran-spires in this
manner from one pewv to another, the.n presently -whizes
along the channel, from whence it cra-wls up to thle'A1eries, till at last the i:-hole church hums with it.anld EtJ;lts/s Tcacher's Assistant.   81
11. It were als) to be wished, that the ladies would be
pleased to confine themselves to whispering in their tere-:atete conferences at an opera or the play-house; which wouldt
be a proper deferience to the rest of the audience. In,'ranzce, we are told, it is common for the arla:erre to ioin
wit'l tlhe p)erl'riers in any favorite air: but we seem to
harve carried this custoin still fulrther, as the company in
or l:,).cs, w--Ir'r_?n concerzning thc-lms!lves in the least with
the pviy, are even louder than the piayers.
12. The wit and humnour of a Vaanbru'gh, or a Congreve,
is frequently interrupted by a brilliant dialogue between
two persons of fashion; and a love scene in the side box
lhas often been more attended to, than that on the stage. As
to their loud bursts of laughter at the theatre, they may
very well be excused, when they are excited by any lively
strokes in a comedy: but I have seen our ladies titter at
the most distressful scenes in Romeo and Ju,liet, grin over
the anguish of a Mit3o;niia, or Belvidera, and fairly laugh
king Lear olff the stage.
13. Thus the whole behaviour of these ladies is in direct
contradiction to good manners. They laugh when they
should cry, are loudl when they should be silent, and are
silent wlhen tlheir conversation is desirable. If a man in
a select company was thus to laugh or whisper me out of
countenance, I should be apt to construe it as an affront,
and dremnand an explanation.
14. As to the ladies I -would desire them to reflect how
much they would suffer, if tieir own weapons were turned
against them, and the gentlemen should attack them with
the sarme arts of laughing and whispering. But, howevcr friee they inay be from our resentment, they are still
open to ill-natured suspicions.'They do not consider,
vlwhat stranr,e coastructionl may be put on these laughs
and whispers.
15. it were indeed, of little consequence, if we only imag,ined, that they vwere taking the reputation! of their acqc:aintance to p1ieccs, or abusing the company round; but
when they indulge themselves in this behaviour, some
perlhaps may be led to conclude, that they are discoursiilg
upon topics, which they are ashamned to speak of in a lees
private mnanner.
16. I f thi: nmi sconduct which I have described, had been$2     the Yoaung lentlema anmd Lady's Monitor,
only to be found, Mr. Town, at my friend's table, I shouldI
not have troubled you with this letter: but the same kiind
of ill breceding prevails too often, and in too mainy places.
The giglers and the whisperers are innumerable; they
beset us wherever we go; and it is observable, that after
a short murinur of whispers, out comes the burst of
laughter: like a gunpowder serpent, which, after hissilig
itbout for some time, goes off in a bounce.
17. Some excuse may perhlaps be framed for this illtimed merriment in the fair sex.  Venus, the goddess of
beauty, is frequentlv called the laughter-loving dame; and
by laughing, our modern ladies may possibly imagine,that
they render themselves like Venus. I have indeed remark-,ed that the ladies commonnly adjust their laugh to their
persons, and are merry in proportion as it sets off their
particular charms.
18. One lady is never further mnoved than to a smile or a
simper,because nothing else slhewsher dimplesto so much
advantage; another who has a fine set ofteeth, runs into a
broad girin; while a third, who is admired for a well turned
nieck and graceful chest, calls up all her beauties to view
ly breaking into vliolent and repeated peals of laughter.
19. I would not be understood to impose gravity or too
great a reserve on the fair sex. Let them  laugh at a
feather; but let them declare openly, that it is a feather
wvhich occasions their mirth. I must confess, that laughter becomes the young, the gav, and the handsome: but
awhisper is unbecoming at all ages, and in both sexes:
nor ought it ever to be practised, except in the round
gallery of St. PIazld's, or in the famous whispering place in
Gloucester cathedral, where two whlisperers hear eacl
ebther at the distanc e of five-and-twenty yards.

2. But thiougha my subiect may interest tle ladies, it
may, peilraps, offend those profound moralists whlio have
Ionr* sii ce determnined, that beauty otght rather to be despise(d thlan desired; thlt, ike strength, it is a merle nattural
excellence, the ist V  f c auses wholly o0ut of ou1' power',
and no- intended eithe r as the pledge of happiness or the
distiicticn of 0nerit.
$. To these gentlemenen I shall remark, that beauty is
amnong those quaiities *-hich no effort of human wit could
e ver bring into conteRlpt: it is therefore to be wished at
least, that beaut';-a  s i some degree dependent upon
sentiment and manners, that so high a privilege might not
be p)ossessed by the unw-orthvy, and tihat 11Ihuman reason
might no lonigel suffer the imortification of those who are
conpcllted to adore an idol, which differs from a stone ol
a log only by the skill of the artificer: and if they) cannot
themselves behold beauty with indifference, they must,
surely, approve an attempt to shew that it merits their
regald.
4. I shall, however, p-rincipally conFsider that species
of beauty whiich is expressed in the countenance; for thisn
alone is peculiar to human beings, and i3 not less complicated than thleir niature. In the- countenance there ar_
luit two requisites to perfect beauity, whlich are wholl},
p)i'oduced by external causes, colour anld proportion: andl
it will appear, that eve(n in comlnon est;imationl tiese arl

are animated, will generally excite the same passions
which they express. If they are fixed in the dead calm
of insensibility, they will be examined withotit emotion;
and if they do not express kindness, they wil'l I}ne bel!eld
without love.

often mounts to favor, and outshines the rest of his'otemporaries. But when men are actually born to titles,
it is almost impossible that they should fail of receiving,
an additional greatness, if they take care to accomplish
themselves for it.
9. The story of Solomcn's choice, does not only instruct us in that point of history, but furnishes out a very fine moral to us, namely, that he who applies his
heart to wisdom, (loes at the same time take the most
proper methcd for gaining long life, riches and reputation,
which are very otten not only the rewards, but the effects
of wisdom.
- 10. As it is very suitable to my present subject, I
shall first of all quote this passage in the words of sacred
writ, and afterwards mention an allegory, in which this
whole passage is represented by a famous FRENCH Poet;
not questioning but it will be very pleasing to such of my
readers as have a taste for fine writing.
11. In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a
dream by night: and God said, " Ask what I shall give
thee." And Solomon said, " Thou hast shewed unto
thy servant David, my father, great mercy, according
as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness,
afiid in uprightness of heart with thee, and tnou hast
kept from him this grpat kindness, that thou hast given
him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this- day. Anci
now, O Lord, my God, thou hast made thy servant King
instead of David my father; and I am but a little child:
I know Aot how to go out or come in.
1:2.. 4-Give therefore thy servant an understanding
heart- to judge thy people, that I may discern between
good ard bad: for who is able to judge this thy so
great a people?" And the speech pleased the Lord, that
Solomonr had asked this thing. And God said unto
him, " Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not
asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for
thyself, nor hast asked the life of tlirne-enemies, but hast
asked, for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
belb,ld, I have done according to thy words, so I have
given thee a wise and understanding heart, so that there
was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall
ny- arise like unto thee.$;4'The Young Gecznle-man and Lady's NMonitor,
is but like that of a savatge for Ihis prey, which cannot be
gratified without the destruction of its object.
7. Among parlticular graces, the dinple has always been
allowed the pre-eminence, and the reason is evident; dicmples are produced by a smile, and a smile is an expression
of complacency; so the contraction of the brows into a
frown, as it is an in:dication of a contrary temper, has.lways been deemed a capital defect.
8.'fThe lover is generally at a loss to define the beauty,
by which his passion was suddenly and irresistibly determined to a particular object; but this could never happen,
if it depended upon any known rule of proportion, upon
the shape and disposition of the features, or the colour of
thelkin: he tells you that it is something which he cannot fully express, something not fixed in any part, but diffused over the whole; he calls it a sweetness, a softness,
a placid sensibility, or gives it some other appellation
which connects beauty with sentiment, and expresses a
charm -which is not peculiar to any set of features, but is
perhaps possible to all.
9. This beauty, however, does not always consist in
smiles, but varies as expressions of meekness and kindness vary w*ith their objects: it is extremely forcible in
the silent complaint of patient sufferance, the tender solicitude of friendship, and the glow of filial obedience;
and in tears, whether of joy, of pity, or of gricf, it is
almost irresistible.
10. This is the charm nwhich captivates without the aid
Vf nature, and without iwhich her utmost bounty is ineffectutal. But it cannot be assumed as a mask to conceal
insensibility or malevolence; it must be the genuine effect of corresponding sentiments, or it will impress upon'the countenance a new and more disgusting deformity,
-affectation: it will produce the grin, the simper, the stare,
the languish, the pout, and innumerable othel grimaces,
that render folly ridictulous, and change pity to contempt.
11. By some, indeed, this species of hypocrisy has been
practised wvith such skill as to deceive superficial observers,
though it can deceive even those but for a moment.--
Looks which do not correspond with the heart, cannlot le
assumed without labour, nor continued without pain; the.~otive to relinqtuish them must, therefore, soon prepoirand Eng1sli  Teacher's Assistalt.   -
derate, an(l the aspect and apparel of the visit will be laid
by together; the smiles ald languishments of art will
vanish, and the fierceness of rage, or the gloom of discontent, will either obscure or destroy all the elegance of
synmmetry and comuplexion.
12. The artificial aspect is, indeed, as wretched a substitute for the expression of sentiment, as the smear of
p.int for the blushes of health: it is not only equally transient, and equally liable to dejection; but as paint leaves
the countenance yet more witherea and- ghastly, the passiolns burst out with mote violence after restraint, the features become more distorted and excite more determined
aversion.
13. Beauty, therefore, depends principally upon the
mind, and, consequently, Inay be influenced by education.
It has been remarked, that the predominanlt passion may
generally be discovered in the countenance; because the
muscles by which it is expressed,being almost perpetually
contracted, lose their tone, and never totally relax; so
that the expression remains when the passion is suspended: thus an angry, a disdainful, a subtle and a suspicious
temper, is displayed in characters that are almost universally understood.
14. It is equally true of the pleasing and the softer passions, that they leave their signatures upon the countenance when they cease to act: the-prevalence of these
passions, therefore, produces a mechanical effect upoi
the aspect, and gives a turn and cast to the features which
makes a more favorable and forcible impression upon the
mind of others, than any charm produced by mere external causes.
15. Neither does the beauty which depends upon temper and sentiment, equally endanger the possessor: " It
" is," to use an eastern metaphor, " like the towers of a
" city, not only an ornament, but a defence;" if it excites desire, it at once controls and refines it; it represses
with awe, it softens with delicacy, and it wins to imitation. The love of reason and virtue is mingled with the
love of beauty; because this beauty is little more than
the emanation of intellectual excellence, which is not an
9bject of corporeaIappetite.
16. As it exeitet a purer passion, it also more forcibly86    1Tle l z:.' - eLz',;z;.'?  i2l Lad?'Js 5lonitor,

would be disappoinited, tlhe placid conficdence of unsuspected simplicity abused, nBli tite peace even of virtue ellidangerecd by the most sordid infidelity, and the breach of the
strongest obli:gations.
17. But the hope of the hypocrite must perishl. \Vhen
the fictitious beauty lhas laid bly her smilies, lwhen the lustre of her eyes and the blioomn of her cheeks have lost
their influence with their nov-elty; what remains hut a
tyrant divested of powler, who will n ever be seen without
a mixture of indignation and disdainl?'I?he olly desire
whichl this object could gratify, will be transferred to
another, not only without reluctance, but with triumph.
18. As resentnment wvill succeed to di:applointment, a
desire to mortify will succeed to a desire to please; and
the husband imay be urged to solicit a'mi;stless, merely
by a remembrance of the beauty of hlis wife, vwhich lasted only till she was kno'w-n.
Let it therefore be remembered, that none can be disciples of the Graces, but in the school of Virtue; and
that those rwho wish to be lovely:, must learn eUaly to be
good.
19. A FRIEND of mine has two daug'hters, w-!om I will
call Lsetitia and Dal/ine. The former is one of the greatest beauties of the age in whiclh she lives; the latter no
way remarkable for any charnms in her person.  Upon
this one circumstance of their outward foirm, tlhe good
and ill of their life seemn to turn. L,titia has not from
her very childhood heard any thing else but commendations of her features and complexion, by which means she
is no other tlhan nature rmade iher, a very Leautiful outside.
2?o. The consciousness of her charms has rendered her
insupportably vain and insolent towards all who have to
do with her. Da/i!..c, who v-was almost twenty before on:  
civil thing had ever been said to her, found herself obligedand Engt'sh Teacher's Assistant.:17
to acquire some accomplishments to make up for the want
of those attractions which she saw in her sister.
21. Poor Dap1hne was seldom submitted to in a debate
wherein she was concerned; her discourse had nothing
to recommend it but the good sense of it, and she was always under a necessity to have very well considered what
she was to say before slhe uttered it; while Latitia was
listened to with partiality, and app)robation sat in the,countenances of those she conversed witlh, before she
communicated what she had to say.
22. These causes have produced suitable effects, and
Lxetitia is as insipid a companion as Dafihneis an agreeab!e one. LxItitia, confident of favour, has studied no arts
to pIease: Da,phne, despairing of any inclination towards
her person, has depended only on her merit. Ltittia has
always something in her air that is sullen, grave and disconsolate.,23. Daphne has a countenance that appears cheerful,
open and unconcerned. A young gentleman saw Lxtitia
this winter at play, and became her captive. His fortune was such, that he wanted very little introduction to
speak his sentiments to her father. The lover was admitted with the utmost freedom into the family, where
a constrained behaviour, severe looks, and distant civilities were the highest favours he could obtain fronm Latiita; while Daphne used him with the good humour, familiarity, and innocence of a sister.
24. Insomuch that he would often say to her, Dear
Da/hrne, wert thou bu:t as hand.somzte as Lutitia!-  She I'e.
ceived such language Nwith tl-hat ingenious iand pleasing
mirth, which is natu:ll t- a woman without design. Iie
still sighed in vain for L,tiia, butl found certain relief in
the agreeable conversation of Daphne. At length, heartily tired with the haughty impertinence of Letitia, and
charmed with repeated instances of good humour he had
observed in Dalphne, he one day told the latter, that he had
something to say to her he hoped she would be pleased
with.

Honour.
i. EVERY principle that is a motive to good actions,
ought to be encouraged, since inen are of so different a
make, that the game principle does not work equally upon all minds. What some men are prompted to by conscience, duty, or religion, which are only different names
for the same thing, others'are prompted to by honour.
2. The sense of honour is of so fine and delicate a na.
ture, that it is only to be met with in minds which are
naturally noble, or in such as have been cultivated by
great examples, or a refined education.  This paper,
therefore, is chiefly designed for those who by mears of~..d PETzglisV, Teacher's Assistant.
any of these advantages, are, or ought to be, actuated by
this glorious principle.
3. But as nothing is more pernicious than a pinciple
or actioni, when it is misunderstood, I shall consider honour with respect to three sorts of men. IFirst of all, with
regard to those wvho have a right notion of it. Secondly,
with regard to those who have a mistaken notion of it.
And thirdly, with regard to those -who treat it as chimerical, and turn it into ridicule.
4. In the first place, true honour, though it be a different principle firom religion, is that which produces the same
effects. The lines of action, though drawnv- from different
parts, terminate in the same point.  Religion embraces
virtue as it is enjoiiied by the laws of God: Honour, aa
it is graceful and ornamental to lhuman nature.
5. The religious man fears, the man of honor scorns to
do an ill action. The former considers vice as something
that is beneath him, the other as something that is offensive to the Divine Being. The one as what is unzecon,ing,the
other as what isjbrbidden. Thus Seneca speaks in tl-e liatural and genuine language of a man of honor, when he
declaires that were there no God to see oir punish vice, he
would not commit it, because it is of so mncan, so base,
and so v-ile a nature.
6. I shall conclude this head with the description of
ihonor in the part of young Jutba.
Henour's a sacred tie, the law of king?,
The noble mind's distinguishing perfection,
That aids and strengthens virtue w-here it meets her,
And imitates her actiens where she is not.
It ought not to be sperted with.-      CArTo.
7. In the second place we are to consider those who
have mistaken notions of honor, and these are sucli as establish any thing to themselves for a point of honor which
is contrary either to the law-s of God, or of their country;
whlo think it is more honourable to revenge than to forgive
an injury; who make no scruple of telling a lie, but would
put any man to deatli that accuses them of it: who alre more
careful to guard their reputation by their courage than by
their virtue.
8. True fortitude is indeed so becoming in humannas

ture, that he who iwants it scarce deserves the name of a
man; but we find several who so much abuse this notion
that they place the whole idea of honor in a kind of brutal
courage; by vwhich means we have had many among us
who have called themselves men of ihonour, that would
have been a disgrace to a gibbet.
9. In a word, the man who sacrifices any duty of a reasonable creature to a prevailing mode of fashion, wNho
looks upon any thing as honourable that is displeasing to his
MIaker, or destructive to society, who thinks himself obliged by this principle to the practice of some virtues and
not of others, is by no means to be reckoned among true
men of honor.
10. Tinmogenees was a lively instance of one actuated by
false honor. Timogeties would smile at a man's jest who
ridiculed his Maker, and at the same time run a man thro'
the body that spoke ill of his friend. Timogenes would have
scorned to have betrayed a secret, that was intrusted with
him, though the fate of his country depended upon the discovery of it.
11. Timogenes took away the life of a young fellow in a
duel, for having spoken ill of Belinda, a lady whom he himself had seduced in his youth, and betrayed into want and
ignominy. To close his character, Timogenes, after havilg
ruined several poor tradesmen's families, who had trusted
him, sold his estate to satisfy his creditors; but, like a
man of honor, disposed of all the money he could make of
it, in paying off his play-debts, or, to speak in his own language, his debts of honor.
12. In the third place, we are to consider those persons,
who treat this principle as chimerical, and turn it into Iidicule. Men who are professedly of no honour, are of a
more profligate and abandoned nature, than even those
-who are actuated by false notions of it, as there is more
hope of? heretic than of an atheist. These sons of infamy
consider honor with old Sy?phax, in the play before mentioned, as a fine imaginary notion, that leads astray young
unexperienced men, and draws them into real mischief,i
twhile they are engaged in the pursuits,of a shadow.
13. These are generally persons, who, in Shakkslecare's
phrase, are worn and hackney'd in the wvays of men;  l hose
lmaglnations are grown callous, and have lost all those 4eand E&amp;:,gi.ih Teacher's Assistant.   93
licate sentirnents which are natural to minds that are innocent and undepraved. Such old battered miscreants
ridicule every thing as roimantic, that comes in competition with theirpresent interest, and treat those persons
as visionaries who dare stand up in a corrupt age, for what
hlas not its immediate reward joined to it.
14. The talents, interest, or experience of such men,
make thlem very often useful in allparties, andat all times.
But whatever wealth and dignities they may arrive at, they
ought to consider, that every one stands as a blot inh the
annals of his country, who arrives at the teimple of honor
by any other way than through that of virtue.

I.ztman Nature.
iMir.' S P EC TA'r,
I.'I -AVE always'been a very great lover of your' spaculations, as well in regard to the subject, as to your
manner of treating it. Human nature I always thought
~ the most useful object of human reason, and to make the
~ consideration of it pleasant and entertaining, I always
" thoaght the best employrent of human wit: other parts
of philosophy may make us wiser, but this not only answers that end, but makes us better too.
2.' Hence it was that the oracle pronounced Socrclte,
the wisest of all men living, beca.use he judiciously made
* choice of human nature for the object of his thoughts;
an enqluiry into which as much exceeds all other learning, as it is of more consequence to adjust the true nature and measures of right and wrong, than to settle
the dcistance of the planets, and comlpute the times of
their' circumvolutions.
3.' One gQod effect that will immediately arise from a
near observation of human nature, is, that we shall cease' to wonder at those actions which men are used to ireckon
wholly unaccountable; for as nothing is produced withs
out a cause, so by observing the nature and course of the
passions, we shall be able to trace every action from its
first conceptions to its death.
