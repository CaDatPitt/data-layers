Is when the multiplier confifts of two, three, four, or':-inore figures or ciphers.
And here you muP- begin with that figure which is in
the place of units of the multiplier, and go through the
whole multiplicand,. by nmultiplying each figure of it by
that faid unit-figure, then by the next, to wit, by the fi-gure in the place of tens of the multiplier; then with the
thlird, &amp;c. to the laMt; always remembering to place the
firftc figure of every produn or line (for you will ever have
as many as you have fignificant figures in the multiplier,) I
fay, remember to place the firft figure of each line exadly
and perpendicularly under the figuire you multiply by; and
then add the feveral lines or produEts together, which fo
collected give the total produ&amp; required, as in the examples
following, viz.trotng Man's BeJt Companion.: Example I.

WVhen you are to multiply by Io, oo, ooo, 000ooo0,
it is only adding or annexing fo many ciphers to the multiplicand, that is, either I, 2, 3, or 4 ciphers, and the
work is done. Example, Suppofe I am to mtultiply 375
by the numbers above; if I multiply it by I o, then I
join o to 375, and then it makes, or the produ&amp;t is 3750;
if by Ioo, then I annex oo, and then it makes 37500;
if -by iooo, I put to it ooo, and then it produces 375000;
and laftly, if by toooo, I then add oooo, and then it
makes- 3750000,' &amp;c.  And thus may any number -be
multiplied, when the multiplier confifis of an unit- with any.
number of ciphers, and done by irfpeaIion only, without
any formal fetting down the multiplicand with a line drawn
under it, &amp;c.
Thus far for dire&amp;tion in the manrner how to multiplyt

And thus much for common multiplication.
I thall, in the niext place, fay fome fmall matter concerns
ing multiplication of money, and a little of its-ufe, and f,
conclude this rule.
Multiplication of Il2onCey  -
Multiplication of money (what moff fhould4. learn above.
any thing) hath great affinity with addition of money; the.
fame method being taken in carrying from one denomination'
-to the next, viz. from farthings to pence, from pence to thilllngs, and from fhillings to pounds. And as in. addition' (and-  roung Man's?eT   Companion.
other multiplications) you begin at the right-hand,. and
proceed:towards the left; fo here you begin at the leaft denomination, which is alfo at the right.hand.
This method of accounting is the moft apt and expeditious of all others, for fmall quantities; and. therefore extremely neceffary in making bills of parcels, &amp;c.: and is,
beyond all contradit&amp;ion, as fure and certain as ally wiatfoever.7The GeneraiRule
Is always to multiply the price by the quantity.
The firft fiep is, for quantities from 2 to I2; and this is
done by one multiplier; as in the examples following.
Example I.                    1. s. d.
Multiply                                     7 12   6

- 4  5   0o
Here I fay 6.times 6 is,36 pence, which isAjuft 3s. I
fet down o in the place of pence, and carry 3s. to the.place: of fhillings (exat!ly the fame as in addition of tmoneiy;) then 6.times 12 is 72, and three is 75s. or 31.,15s,
wherefore, I fet down t0 5in the place, of,flhillings, and
carry- 3 to the poinds; then 6 times 7 is 42, and 3 is 451
So the whole amount of the fix pieces,of cloth, at7!. 7 zs.
6d. per: piece, is 45l.!5s. as in the work,: which is very
concife.
Example 2.
Again, how much is 9 times ~s. 4d. or what is the
amount ofg' mer ks?';  
In this example I fay 9            --
times-4 is 6d,.-or 3s. I fet  6  q  o
down o, and carry 3; then
9 times - is 27, and 3 make 3o; I fet down o, and carry
3 (as in multiplication of fimple numbers;) then 9 times I is
9, and three is X 2, which is in the place of tens of fhillings,
arid bein: halved, make juft 61. and fo much is the value Bt

The next degree or ftep of advance in this way of reck.
oning, is of quantities exceeding  2, even to I2 times 122or 144; all which, as far as 144., are found in that excel.
lent table, the table of multiplication; which is a ready
Lelp to all purpofes of reckoning, and particularly in this
way: and that you may proceed with dexterity, you muit
be very ready in the faid table, that you may be immediately apprehenfive what component parts hit your quantity propofed, or pretty near-it (for any quantity below 12
lieeds no recolledidn at all, as in two of the examples fore..
going) and then work accordingly; if the quantity be 15
yafds, I readily know that 3 times 5 is I5; and therefore
3 and 5, -or.-and 3, are to be my multipliers; if the quano
tity -were 21, then 3. and 7, or 7 and 3, would be multi-;
pliers: if 30, then 5 and6, or 6 and 5; alfo 3 and io, or
lo,and 3; if f45, 48; 56, 66, 72; 96, i&amp;c. were the
quantities,' then- 5;'and 9, 6 and 8, 7 and 8, 6 and -I i, 6
and 12, 8 and i-2,- &amp;c. are to: be multipliers, and exadcly
hit the; feveral quhntities of which they are component parts,
and examplesof this kind have two multiplications. for, thei
folutlion.
When the quantity propofed is a number iiregular, or'fuch a nuimber that no two numbers in the table. can be.
found to anfwer it, then -we- muft multiply by two- fuch
ilumbers as- come pretty near it, as is faid above; and for
the number waniting, to make -up' the number or quantity
propofed, multiply the given price of one by'the nunmber
that is wanting, which will make three produ&amp;s by three
Mnultiplications; which latt produ&amp; mufft be added to the
~oregoing'produ&amp;s refulting from two multiplications, and
the total will be the anfwer.

The Lufe'of this rule is to know how many times one number or film- is contained in another; as if it were aflked, howy

many_times Ir is there in 144? anfwer--z times.
As by multiplication great names or denominations are
brought into fmall; fo~contrarily by divifion, fmall names
are brought into greater; as, farthings (from one gradation
to another) into pounds, pounds weight itnto tuns weight,
and gallons liquid into tuns liquid, &amp;c.In this rule we are to take particular notice of thefe
three certain terms following, viz.

z.  The  Divifor, or number by which we divide.

how often the divifor is contained in the

4. The Remainder; which is an uncertain branch of this
rule, becaufe'there is fometimes a remainder, and fometimes
not'.  (' -And you muft particularly note, That the-remainder is ever of the farne name with the dividend, and is
always lefs than the divifor; for, if it be more, or equal to
the divifor, the work is wrong.
-Divifion is either fingle or compound; fingle, when the
divifor con`fifteth of a fingle figure, and the dividend of two
at mott: any of this fort is anfwered by the -mlnltiplication
table,; as, if 63 were to be divided by 7, the anfwer will be
9 times. Here 63 is the dividend, 7 the divifor, and 9 the.quotient or' anfwer.
Compound divifion is when the dividend hath many, or
more figures or ciphers than two, and the divifor one or
more figures or ciphers, &amp;c.

Having fet down the example with two crooked tines,
or half parenthefis, one for the divifor, and the other for
the quotient, I begin, according to the afore-mentioned
genieral rule for working,, by feeking or aflcing how often
I can take 7 the divifor, out of:36 the two firf[ figures
of the dividend (ior I cannot take 7 out of 3, the quotient
being never to begin with o) and the anfwer is 5 times;
wherefore, I place 5 in the quotient, and multiply the
divifor 7 by it (as dire&amp;ded in the general rule) faying, 5
times 7 is 35, which I place under 36; and then, thirdly, according to the faid rule, I fubtradt 35 from 36;
and there remains I; to which I bring down the next
or laft figure of the dividend, viz. 5, and then there
is I5 for a new 4dividend or dividual' to work upon; then I
afil or feek again, how oft 7 may be taken in 15? and theanfwer is 2 times; wherefore, I put two in the quotient
next to the 5; by which 2 I alfo multiply the divifor 7,
faying, twice 7 is I4; which I fet down under the IS, and
fubtra&amp;Q-, and there. remains i, which I place between two
femiccircles thus ( ) as it Itands in the work; where obferve,
That 365 is the dividend; 7 the divifor, 52 the quotient,
or anfwer, and i the remainder: the quotient declares that
7 is contained in 365, 52 times, and 1 over, or remaining;
which I fet over the divifor thus. and lignifies that there
is one-feventh of a week, or i day, more than juct 52
weeks in a year, or 365 days; which is eafily to be found
by colled&amp;ing the days of each calendar month as they htand
in the almanack.
You may note, That the faid 4- is properly what is called
a fradion, or a piece or fegment of the dividend; but of
this hereafter.
Note alfo, That if there had been more figures or ciphers in the dividend, they muft have all been brought
down one by one at a time (atid never but one at a time)
and (after fubtraftion) fet to the remainder; and if there
remains o, you muft fill bring down b~t one cipher at a

muft be a figure or o placed in the quotient, according to
the times you can take the divifor out of the feveral dividuals you make, by bringing down a figurre or cnpher at a.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~8~L.d.r-~~JL JL.j96            roung Man'sr BgEl Compgatoin.

remain 4; fo the quotient fhews that each perfon mutffhave
1007 pounds of tobacco for his fhare in the dividend 8060,
and there remain 4 -pounds over and above, which makes
half a pound more due to each man, becaufe 4 the remainder is half of 8 the dlvifor; and fo the work is done, the

down a figure or cipher, you are to make a point under it

which is not readily to be anfwered; but how fmany times

faying, 4 times 2 is 8, placing it under 9 the lividual; theni
4 times three is 12, which fet down uinder i4; fo there is

you have a place more in the dividual than in the divifor,
then always feek how oft you can take the firat figure of
the divifor out of the two firfl of the dividual, and the anfwer is 7 times, but it will not bear 7 times, for 7 times
32 is 224, and you cannot take 224 out of 210, or rather, you cannot take 22 out- of 21, wherefore, try in
your mind, before you fet down the anfwer, or figure of
the quotient, whether it will go the number of times, as
is moft eafily fuggefted, as here the queftion or demand is
readily anfwered 7 times, and fo many times 3 may be
taken in zi, but, when you come to multiply the whole

Again, admit a nobleman hath 3o,0oo0. per annum, what.is his daily income?

in the dividend (.for o muff never begin the quotient," as.
was faid before) and make a point under it, viz under
the latt o but one, as may be feen in the example: and
there being a place more in this dividual thain in the divifor, I feek how oft the firft figure of the divifor, viz. 3,
is contained in the two firft firgures or places of the dividend, viz. 30, and the anfwer is ten times, but you are
never to take above 9 times at once in any of thefe examples of divifion, wherefore, try in your mind whether
it will- bear 9 times before you fet it down in the quoH       3roung Ma'n s B7 Compan~on.

3z cannot be taken out of 30, wherefore, take a figure lefs

Then to the remainder 8o, I bring down o, the lafl flgure

When any quantity is fuch a number, thiat any two digits, of the multiplication table, multiplied together make
the faid quantity or number, then the quotient may be
very expeditioufly found at two divifions, and fooner than
at one,
Example. Divide 7872 by 32.
In this example, the component parts, which.multi.
plied together make the divifor 32z, are 4 and 8, or 8 and
4; for it. matters not which of thein yout divide by firit-;
for either way will give a true and the fame quotient;

weight into pounds weight, by multiplying by 4, and by
28, or by I I2; or lower into ounces or drachms, by multiplying by i 6 and I 6.

weight, by dividing by z8 and 4; the drachms into pounds,
by dividing by x 6 and i 6.
But you may note, That pounds are brought into pence,
by multiplying by 240; or into farthings, by mtltiplying by

Thefe foregoing examples are great names to be brought
into fmall (as may eafily be obferved-and underfiood;)
therefore, as the firt rule diredeth, it is done by multiplication, by multiplying the greater name by the number
of the next leffer name, that makes one of the faid greater;
as in the laft examples the leffer name to pounds is Ihillings,
wherefore, I multiply by 20, becaufe 20 of that leffer name
make one of the faid greater name, i. e. 20 flillings make

of them make a penny, and the quotient is pence; then
thefe pence I divide by I2, becaufe I2 of them make a
fhilling, and that quotient is fhillings; which fhillin'gs I
divide by 20, to bring them into pounds, thus; I cut off
the cipher in the dividend towards the right, for the cipher
that is in the divifor 2o, which is alfo feparated from 2 with
a dafh of the- pen (as may be feen in the work;) then 1
halve the figures one by one, as they are united with the
-remainder in tbe -dividend; which half is pounds, and is a
fhort way of dividing by 20: in the example, I fay, the half
of io (becaufe I mufl not fet down o at the beginning) is
5, and the half of 3 is I, and there remains I; which makes
the next; which is o, to; and the half of lo is 5: fo that
1300- flillings make 515 pounds, or there are fo many
pounds in -49440o farthings.
Note, In dividing by 20, as above, if any thing remains,
it muff be joined or annexed to the figure or cipher cut off;
as, fuppofe there had in halving the laft figure (excepting
-what you cut off) remained I; then that one muft have been
joined to the cipher feparated or cut off, and there would
have been ten-lhillings.

In- the firft of the two foregoing examples, I divide the
pounds by 28, to bring them into quarters, then I divide
thofe quarters by 4, to bring them into hundreds weight, as
in the work.
In the fecond way, I divide the pounds weight by I x2sroung Man's Bejt Companion.             1I
the pouids in a hundred weight, and it brings the pounds
weight into hundreds weight at once.
The faid examples are of fmrall denominations to be
brought into greater, and, therefore, according to the
fecond rule of dire&amp;ion, it is done by divifion, by dividing
the leffer name by as many of them as make the next greater
name; that is, by 28, becaufe 28 of them make one of
the next greater name, viz. a quarter of a hundred; and
this' redu6tion is called reduEtion afcending, becaufe it
brings low or fmall names to higher or gleater denominations.  By which may be obferved, that all queftions in
redut&amp;ion, whether afcending or defcendino- are anfwered
either by multiplication or divii0on, or by boih; as will
plainly appear in the fundry examples of reducing of divers
denominations to others.
When it is required to reduce numbers of feveral denominations by redu&amp;qion defcending, or by multiplication,
you are to work as before; but you mull always remember to take in fuich numbers as ftand in the place of the
next inferior denomination, as when you multiply the
pounds by zo, if there be any fhillings in the denomination or place of flillings, you muft take them in; fo likewife, when you multiply the fhillings by I2, if there be
any pence in the placeof pence, you muff alfo take them
in: and- fo when you multiply the pence by 4, to'bring
them into farthings, you muff take in the farthings, if
there be any, in the, place of farthings, as in the following
work.
Example 5-.

The example is fo plain in the work, that it hardly needs
any explication; but I begin to fay o is o, but 6 in the
units of fhillings is 6; then twice 6 is I 2, and x in the tens
of fllillings is 13, 3 and carry f; and twice 4 is 8, and I i1

&amp;c. Then adding the two produ&amp;cts together, they make
6344 pounds, contained in 56 C. 2 qrs 1i6 lb. as in the

by multiplying the 56 C. by 1 X2, the pounds in a C. wt. and

Redudion afcending
Is the bringing numbers from a leffer denomination to a
greater, and is the reverfe of redu&amp;ion defcending; and
each may ferve as a. proof to the other, one being performed
by multiplicatiofl; and the other by divifion.
And note, That when at any time in redu&amp;ion defcending
you take in, oi add to, the odd. money, weight, or meafure,
as you rultiply the feveral denominations, fuch quantities'will be remainders in redudion afcending.

This method is of ufe in reducing the exchanges of Cadiz, Leghorn, and Genoa. Or, when the exchange is at
fo many pence, and eighths of a penny (as often the exchanges run) then multiply the given number to reduce
it into pence, by the pence contained in a piece of eight;
and alfo multiply the faid given number apart, by the numerator, or ppper figure of the fra6tion, and divide by the
denominator, or under figure of the fra&amp;dion, and the quotient will be pence; which added to the other pence produced
by multiplying the given number by the pence contained in

But ducats, dollars, crowns, millreas, are more expedir
tioufly cafl up by the rules of pra&amp;ice, hereafter to be
fhewn,
And fo much for. Rediudtion. The next rule in arith.
metic is,
THt GOLDEN RULE, OR RULE OF THREE.
It is called the- Golden Rule from its excellent per.
formance in arithmetic, and in other paits of mathemati.
cal learning.
And it is called the Rule of Three, becaufe from three
numbers given, propofed, or known, we find out a fourth
number required, or unknown, which bears fuch proportion to the third, as the fecond doth to the firit number.
From whence alfo it is called the Rule of Proportion.
And of this proportion there are two forts; one called
DireEt, and the other Indire&amp;, or Reverfe.
Dire&amp; proportion is, when the fecond and third numbers
are to be multiplied together, and-their produ&amp; divided by
the fir-ft.  
Indirie&amp;, or reverfe proportion is, whlen the fiirf and
fecond numbers are to be multiplied together, and their
produ&amp; divided by the third.
In direA proportion, the fourth number, 6r anfwer to. the
queftion, contains the third number as often (or. as many
times) as the fecond contains the firi,  
But, in indire&amp; proportion, the greater the third number
is, the lefs is ihe fourth; and the leffer the third number is,
the greater is the fourth,.The AJting the quef/ion.
The cniefeft diicult Fthat occurs in the rule of three, i.
the right'placing the numnbers, or ftating the queftion: for,
when that is done; you have nothing more to do, but to
multiply and divide, and the work is done.
And to this end, we are to remember, that of the three
given numbers two of them are always of one name or depomination, and the other number is ever of the fame name
with the fourth number or anfwver required; and muft ala'ays be the fecond-or middle number; and the number thatrToung: Man's Bt Companion.           123
aflketh the queftion, muif fRill poffefs the third or laft
place; and the other number of the fame name with the
third, muflc be the firit number: for the firft and' third
numbers muff always be of one name, viz. both money,
both weight, both time, or both meafure. And though
they be of one kind, yet, if one of them is altered by
reduAion, from a high to a lower name, then the other
muff be reduced to the fame name.  For you muff particularly note, c T'hat if either the firt or third numbers
confifts of feveral denominations, that is, of pounds and
fhillings; or pounds, fhillings, and pence; or of pounds,
fhillingS, pence, and farthings; or of tuns, hundreds,
quarters, and pounds, &amp;cc. thbn muit they be reduced to
the loweft name mentioned.  And, if one happen to be
of divers denominations, and the other but of one name;
then the number of one name muft be reduced as low, or

Then you are to multiply the fecond and third numbers
together, (when the proportion is dire&amp;) and divide the

both gallons: and I34 being the number that afited the
queftion, it bath the third place, as it always nuft, -as
before afferted; and 41. los. the fecond number, being of
two denominations, viz. pounds and fhillings, it is reduiced into the loweft mentioned, -viz. fhillings, as before
direa&amp;ed, and then the three numbers are thefe, viz. 1290--I34; and 134, the third number, being multiplied
by 9o, tne fecond number, produces I2o6o; which divided by t2, the firft number, quotes 1oo0, which are

middle number, and there is a remainder of 265; which
multiplied by 2o, according to reduaion, and the produnt
fill divided by 365, there- comes out 14 fhillings, and yet
there is a remainder of I90, which multiplied by I2, and
the produ&amp;t divided by 365, gives 6d. and there is a remainder of go: which, if multiplied by 4 (the laft inferior name) and divided by 365, yet would not come to a

Here the yards are divided by 4, becaufe 3d. is the 4th
of a fhilling; and it quotes 61,:fhillings, and z remains, or
two 3 pences. So the anfwer is 31. is. 6d.
And thus may any propofed queftion be anfwered, belonging to the firit table, or parts of a fhilling, that is, by
dividing the given number by the denominator of the fraction,. and the quotient will be always fhillings, which (the
rernai'nder -being known as above) bring into pounds, by
dividing by 20, &amp;c.
When the price of the integer is at a, a halfpenny, or three farthings more than the valdii  he pence
mentioned, then for thofe farthings take,a pr  part of
the foregoing quotient found for the pence, and add tthem
t%gether.

I have not here rootn to fpeak of the various and almofi
infinite methods and rules of PraaCtice (having feveral other
fubje&amp;6s and things to treat on) but fhall leave fome general
rules, which, if heedfully noted, will be of great ufe to
learners; and are thefe, viz.
I. When the price is parts of a, farthing, or of a penny,
as', 3, *r, &amp;c. then multiply the integers by the numerator, and divide by the denominator, an-d the refult will
be either farthings, or pence; which reduce to pounds,
&amp;c.
2. WThen the price is pence, and no even part of a fhilling; as fuppofe 5d. 7d. 8d. or gd. then it may be done by
taking their parts, as 3d. and zd. is 5d. and 4d. and 3d. is
7d.'and 4d. and 4d. is 8d. and 6d. and 3d. is 9d.; but it is
an eafy and fure way to multiply the given number by 5, 7,
8, or 9, and then the produ&amp; is pence; which reduce to
pounds by redulion.
3. When the price is pence, and parts of a penny; as
id.    2d..- or 6d. 3, then work for the penny by taking the rt;  for 2d. the'; and for 6d. the:: thenr, for
the farthings take ~ of the penny line, and for;,  ~ ofroung Man's Bs    Comlnzgon.          139
the two penny line: and for 3, take ~ of the fix penny
line, then add their refults together, and the total will be
fhillings, which reduce to pounds by dividing by 20. Or,
by the fure way of bringing the mixed number into the
loweft denomination; as ld.,, into 5 farthings; 2d. -,
into 5 halfpence, and 6d. 4, into z7 farthings; then multiply the integers by 5; and the produd is farthings; or by
5 halfpence, and the produdt will be halfpence; or by 27
farthings, and the produd will be farthings; which, whether farthings or pence, reduce to pounds, &amp;c.
4. When the price is flilings and pence, ol flhillings,
pence, and farthings, multiply the integers by the fhillings
of the price, and take parts for the pence, or pence and
-farthings, &amp;c.
5. If the price be pounds and (flillings, or pounds, tflil.
lings, pence, and farthings, multiply by the flllings, in the
price, that is, in the pounds and Ihillings, and take parts for
the pence and farthings.
6. When-the number of integers hath a fra&amp;ion annexed,
pr belonging to them; as 4, -,, &amp;e. then take r,, or:, of the price of onle of the integers, and add that to the
other refultsTA RE AND T RETT, &amp;c.
Grofs weight is the weight of the goods in hundreds,
quarters, and pounds, with the weight of the hogflbead,
calk, cheft, bag, bale, &amp;c. that contains the goods.
Tare is allowed to the buyer for the weight of the hogfhead, cafl&lt;,,cheft, bag, bale, &amp;c.
Trett is an allowance made for wafte, duft, &amp;c. in fundry
forts of goods, as tobacco, cotton, pepper, fpices, &amp;c, and
is always 4 lb. per o04 lb. futtle, a'iidfound by dividing the
futtle- pounds by 26, becaufe 4 times' 26 make Io4 lb.
When the grofs' weight is brought into pgunds, and before
the tare is dqdueted, they are called potinds grofs; and
after the tare is fubtradted, the remainding pcoinds are called

There are fome few other rules, fuch as barter, or ex.
changing goods for goods; alfo exchange for coin, profit,
lofs, &amp;c.; but all of them being done either by the rule
of three, or by rules of pra6iice, it is, therefore, here unneceffary to enlarge upon them.
OF FRACTIONS, VULGAR AND DECIMAL.
What fra&amp;ions are, hath already been hinted in the
rule of divifion, from whence they arife; for the remainder
is a part of the dividend remaining undivided, as admit,
541. is divided into twelve equal parts, the quotient is 4,
and the remainder 6: fo that here 6 remains as yet undivid-ed by iz, and is, therefore, 6 parts in  2; or fix twelfths,
equal to a half, for 6 is the - of x 2; and the remainders alre
ufaally fet down in this form  I, and -when fo, the expteffion is called a fration, whofe parts are underftood by, thefe
names, viz.
6 Numerator.
1 2 Denominator.
The numerator is above the fhort line, and fheweth the
number of parts fignified by the fradion; and the denominator ftands under the line, and declares the number of parts
into which.the int'eger or whole number is divided, as above
541. is divided intooi2 parts, and the quotient fays there
are 4 times 12 contained in 54, and 6 remains, which is 6
of a pound, or los. as above faid.
Fraftions are thus fet down and read, viz. 4,    one
fourth; _, one half; I, one third; -, one fifth;,, one
fixth;,  two thirds; ~, two fourths; -, two fixths; ~,
five fevenths, &amp;c.
Fradcions are either proper or improper.  A   proper
fra&amp;tion hath its numerator lefs than the denominator, as
-, five eighths; - 4 twenty-four fifty lixths, &amp;c.An improper frafion hath its numerator greater than
the denominator, as 3, feven thirds; x4, forty-eight fifteenths, &amp;c.
Again, fradions are either fimple or compound; fimple,
when part of an integer or thing hath but one numerator,
nid one denor inator; as ~ of a pound fierling: - of a hun-Lrloung Man's Beg Companion.           143
&amp;dred weight; ~ of a tun; f- of a gallon, &amp;c.  Compound
is a fradtion of a fra(dion, as the' of 4 of a pound flerling,
which is equal to half a crown; oir, when one is divided into
any number of parts, and thofe parts again fubdivided into
parts, &amp;c.
Fradions are of two kinds, viz. Vulgar and Decimal.
Vulgar fradtions are as declared before. Decimal fradions
are artificially expreffed, by fetting down the numerators
only, the denominators being. underPtood, and are always
an unit, with as many ciphers annexed as there are places
in the numerator; and, therefore, muft be either lo, or
fome power of 1 o, as 100oo, 100ooo, Io,(oo, or 0Loo,oo0
&amp;c.
Decimal fraa&amp;ions appear as whole numbers (and are in
the general fo wrought) but are diftingtliihed from them
by a point or comma prefixed, thus,5 is read five tenths;,32 thirty-two hundredths; and,256 two hundred fiftyfix thoufandths: but of decihnal fractions and their ufe hereafter.
Redudcion of vulgar fraEtions is to fit or prepare them
for addition, fubtraAion, &amp;c.
I. To reduce a mixed nuniber to an improper fration.
Rule.
Multiply the integer by the denominator, and take in the
numerator.
Example.
Reduce I2 gallons 3 to an improper frad;on, thus,
4
- 5  New numerator.
4 Anfwver 4,  or I quarts.
2. To reduce an improper fraStion to a whole or mixed numler.
Rule.
Divide the numerator by the denominator.

3 remain. equal to',
Here 12 gallons is the whole number, 3 the fraftion, the
fame' with three quarts.
3.' ro reduce fraet'ions to a common denominator.
Rule.
Multiply the numerator, of each fradion into all the
denominators, except its own, and the produ&amp; will be a
numerator to that fraaion; and then do fo by the next,
&amp;C..,
Example.
Reduce.-, -, and -, of any integer, to a common denominator; fay, twice 4 is 8, and 6 times 8 is 48, for a
numerator to -; then fay, 3 times 3 is 9, and 6 times 9
is 54, for a new numerator to 3; laffly, fay, 5 times 4 is
2o, and three tiirtes 20 is 6o, the numerator to -: then,
to find the common denominator, fay, 3 times 4 is 12, and

4. To reduce a fraflion to its lovez/J terms.
If they are even numbers, take half-of the numerator,
and denominator, as long as you can: and then divide
them by any digit-number (i. e. 3, 4 5, 6, &amp;c.) that will
leave no remainder in either.rouig Manfs Be_ Compan;on. 45
Example.
Reduce 1 6 into its' loweft terms; fay, the  of 56 is
28, and the 4 of 84 is 42, and then the 4 of 28 is I4,
and the  of 42 is zI: fo the fra&amp;ion  is reduced to -4
And fince they cannot be halved any longer; for though
you can halve 14, yet you cannot 2I, without remainder;
try, therefore, to divide them by fome other digit-number,' and you will find that 7 will divide both numerator
and denominator without any remainder; then fay the 7's
in 14 twice; and the 7's in 2I three times; fo the fraction 5 reduced into its loweft terms, will be, two thirds;
which is of the fame value as s.  The work is done in
this form.

Addition of Zzulgar Fra6ionsOr
If the fraCtions to be added have a common denominator,
add the numerators together for a numerator, and place it
over the common denominator.
Example.

if the numerator 9 be divided by the denorni-  1. I 4
nator 5, I fay, the 5's in 9 once, and 4 remains, which is 4 of a pound, or i6s.
But, if the fradions to be divided have unequal denominators, then they'muft be reduced to a common denominator, by the rule before fhewn, before addition can be made;
and then proceed as above.
2. When mixed numbers are to be added, work with the

poutids, the fame anfwer as above.
3. When compound fra&amp;ions are to be added to fimpl1
ones, reduce the compound fraaion to a fimple one, as before dire&amp;ed; and then proceed as above.
Example.
Add X and  to - of 4 of a pound; thus, once 2 is 2,
and twice 4 is 8, therefore, - is equal to the compound
fra&amp;ion; then add, faying, 2 and 3 is 5, and 2 is 7, the

Note, The difference between the numerators is the difference' of the fra&amp;qions.
Again, from - of a pound, take I5; here the fradions
are to be reduced to.a common denominator: 36 is the firit
Dnumerator, and 20 the fecond numerator, their difference
is I6; and 48 is the common denominator; fo that -'2,  or
-, in its lowelf terms, is the difference between 3 of a pound,
and T- of a pound.

Reduce the compound fra&amp;ion to a fimple one, and then
work as before.
Example..
From  - take 2 of.; fay, twice 8 is t6, anld 3' times

Multiplication of Vullgar Fraaions.
Rule.
Multiply the numerators into one another for the numerator of the produ&amp;t; and then do the fame by the denominators, for the denominator of the produ~dt.
Example.
Multiply X of a pound, by 5- of ditto; fay, 3 times 5 is
15, the numerator; and 4 times 6 is 24, the denominator;
fo the anfwer is x5, or, in its lowefl terms,.
You are to note, That multiplication in fra&amp;ions leffens
the produdt, thougfh, in whole numbers, it augments it; as
above X or I2s. 6d. is lets than I- or i6s. 8d. and alfo lefs
than the other fraftion 3 or 15s. The reafon of which I
have not here room to infift on; but it is given in my Arithmetic, in multiplication of vulgar fra&amp;ions; to which book,
I refer the reader for that, and fundry enlargements in the
feveral rules of the fcience of arithmetic.
2. To multiply a whole number by a fraRion.

3. 7T multiply a fimple by a comnpound fra6tion.

Divi7on of Vulgar Frattions.
Rule.
Multiply the numerator of the divifor into the denomina.
tor of the dividend, and the produd is the denominator of
the quotient; and then multiply the denominator of the
divifor into the numerator of the dividend, and the produce
will be the numerator of the quotient.
Example.
Divide'5 by,)15(s4 quotient.
Here I6 multiplied by 2, gives 32; and 15 by 3, gives
45: fo that the quotient is 4s, equal to  {4, as in the
work.
Again, fuppofe 4 was divided by, the quotient will
be 7 equal to X integer, or whole thing.  And fo for any
other example.
Reduflion of Decimal Frat7ions.
What a decimal frad&amp;ion is, hath been already fhewn.
The next ftep is, how to reduce a vulgar fradcion into a
decimal: which is no more than to annex ciphers at difcretion (that is 2, 3, or 4, &amp;c.) to the numerator, and then
divide it by the denominator.
Example I.
Reduce X of a pound fterling to a decimal.,75  that is 75 hundredths, equal to 3 qrs. of any
thing, whether money, weight, meafure, &amp;c. as being 3 of
Ioo; and fo 25 hundredths is, in decimals, the quarter of
any thing, as being X of loo; and five tentlls expreifes the
half of any thing, as being the ~ of Io.
In reduation of decimals, fometimes it happens that a
cipher or ciphers muIt be placed to the left-hand of the
decimal, to fupply the defea or want of places in the quotient of the divifion. In this cafe always remember, that
fo many ciphers as you annex to the denominator of the
vulgar fra&amp;tion, fo many places you muft point off in the
L 4otoung Man's BeJf    Companiona
quotieat towards the left-hand; but, if there be not fo many
places to point off, then you muft fupply the defec by placing
a cipher or ciphers to the left of the decimal.
Example 2.
Reduce gd. or c, to the decimal of a pound fterling,
thus:
240)9,ooo0000(,0375
72 o..
18oo
i68o
1200
1200
Here are but three places
in the quotient, viz. 375; and, therefore I cannot point off 4
for the foiur ciphers: annexed
to 9; therefore, I prefix o to
the left of the q, tient, 375,
tiohs,,0375, and then it is
5    ten thoufandth parts of
an integer.
(o)
The more ciphers you annex; the nearte you brin-g your
decirntl to the truth: but in moft cafes, four ciphers annexed are fufiicient. But when you are to reduce -, -, or
3 (as above) of an integer to a decimal, or any number of
fhiliings to. a decimal of a pound, two ciphers are fufficient,
One example Lmore.

towards the left,hand of the quotient: to which end remember this rule: obferve how many decimal places there are in
the divifor, and in the dividend, and find the difference;
and whatever it is, fo many places mufl be pointed off to the
right-hland of the quotient.2oung Man'~r Bft Coinpavion.

Thie next. qualification to fit a man for buflnefs, after
aritbmetic!, isc the art of book-keeping, or' merchants' accompts, after the Italian manner, by way of d-ouble entry.
It is not without good reafon that mioft people of hufinmefs'Aand ingenuity are dlefiroLus to be m-afters, of this"'art;

from an-accompt well kept, the pleafure that accrues to a
perfon by feeing what the gains by each fpecies of goods he
deals in, and his whole profit by a year's trade; and thereby
alfo to know-the true Rate of his affairs and circumftances,
fo that he may, according to difcretioli, retrench, or enlarge,
his expences, &amp;c. as he fhall think fit.
- This art of book-keeping, or merchants' accompts, is
talked of by many, but truly underftood but by very few;
for every petty fchool-mafter in any bye-corner, will be fure
to have merchants' accompts, expreffed on his fign, as a
principal article of his ability in teaching; though, f'tridly
fpeaking, for want of the pra&amp;dical part, he knows hardly
any thing of the matter, and is, confequently, incapable of
teaching it.

called the,Memorial) Journal, and Ledger.

In this book tntf be daily written whatever occurs itl the

bought or fold, borrowed, &amp;8c.
The WaRfe-book is ruled with one marginal line, and
three lines for pounds, fllinirgs, and pence, and the day of
the month, and year of our Lord, is inferted in the middle
of-the page.  Itn this book, any one may write, and, on

Into this book every article is brought out of the Waffebook, -but in other terms, in a better ftyle, and in a fairer
hand, without'any alteration of ciphers or figures; and
every parcel, one after another, is promifcuoufly fet without
intermiffion, to make the book, or feveral entries of it, of
more credit and validity in cafe of any law difpute, or any
other controverfy that may happen between merchant and
merchant. In'this book you ate to diftinguifh the debtor
and creditor (or in other terms the debit-and credit.) And,
to this book you muft have recourfe for the particulars of
an accompt, which in the ledger are entered in one line.
In this book alfo the day of the month is uftally placed in
the middle of the page; it is ruled with double marginal lines,
for references to the ledger, and with'three lines for 1. s. d.
as the wafte-book.
L EDG E R.
From the journal, or day-book, all matters or things
are pofted into the ledger, which, by'the Spaniards, is
called El libro grande, as being the biggeft book, or chief
of accompts.  I'he left-hand fide of this book is called
the debtor, and the right the creditor fide; and the numbers or folios of each fide muft be alike, as 4- debtor,
and alfo 45 creditor.  The day of the month (in this
book) is fet in a narrow-column on the left-hand, and the
month on the left, of that: but where I kept books, the
number in a narrow column referred to the journal-page,
and the month. and day was placed in the broad column,
to the right of that; and at the head of each' folio -is. the
name of the place of refidence, and the year of our Lord,
as thus:
London, anno                   i762.
But the' example of thefe feveral books hereafter following, will make the foregoing hints of them much -more intelligible.  The following is a general rule, tipon w-hich
mofltof the entries in book-keeping depend, viz.
All things received, or-the receiver, are debtors to the

Havinjg given a-n account of the feveral books, and

Firft, For money received, make carl Dr. to the party
that paid it (if for his own accompt) and the party Cr.
Secondly, Motey paid, make the receiver Dr. (if for his

Fifthly, Goods bought at time; goods bought are Dr.
to the feller of them, and the feller Cr. by the goods.
Sixthly,, Goods fold'for time,-juft the contrary, i. e. the
party that bought them is Dr. to goods, and the goods Cr.
by the party.
Seventhly, Goods bougnt, part for ready money, and

Eighthly, Goods fold, partfol- ready money, and the refL

felling man for fo much as is left unpaid, and to catff for
fo much paid in ready money: and fo on the contrary, for'gods fold.
Ninthly, When you pay money before it is due, and
are to have difcount allowed you, make the perfon Dr. to
cafh for fo much as you pay him, and to- prOfit and lofs for
the difeount; or, make the receiving man Dr.: to fundries,

Firft, If the Dr. fide be more than the credit, make the
old accompt Cr. by the new; and, if the contrary, make
the new accompt Dr. to the old': but, if the Dr. fide be
- elfs than the credit, then make the old acconapt Dr. to the
nrog ManAs Bej/ Companzon.               167
sew, and the new accompt Cr. by the old, for fuch a rea
or fum as you Ihall find in the accompt.
2. A-n accompt of corpany, wherein you have placed
more received of another than his- tock; then add as
much on the debit fide as you find on the credit fide; to
the end that, in the new accompt, you may have fo much
debit as you put in, and fo much credit as you have received.
3. In accompts of merchandife, you muft enter the gaii
or lofs, before you make the old accompt Cr. by the new,
and the new Dr. to the old, for the remainder of goods

accompt to balance on the Dr. fide, to anfwer the line on
the Cr. fide of the new acco:mpt.
How -to balance at the year's end, and thereby to know the
slate of your afairs and circumflances.
You muR make an accompt of balance on the next void
leaf or folio of your ledger to your other accompts; but,
after fo done, do not venture to draw out the accompt aof
balance in the faid folio, till you have -made it exa&amp; on a
fheet of paper,.ruled and titled for that purpofi; becaufe of
miltakes or errors that may occur or happen in the courfe
of balaancing your ledger; which are to be reaified, and
will caufe erafements or alterations in that accornpt, which
ought to be very fair and exa&amp;A; anid after yotu havem-irade it
to. bear in the faid flbeet, copy fair the faid accompt of balance in the ledger.
Tht rules for balancing are thefe, viz,
M 4x68   -       toung Man's Bedf Companion.
if, Even your accompt of cafh, -and bear ihe nett reft to
balance Dr.
2dly, Caft up all your goods bought, and thofe fold, ofwhat kind foever, in each acco'mpt of goods, and fee whe.
ther all goods bought be fold or not;, and, if any remain
uniold, value them as they cofl: you, or according to the
prefent market price, ready money, and bear the nett reft to
balance Dr.
3dly, See what your goods or wares feverally cofl, and
alfo how much they were fold, for, and bear the nett gain or
lofs to the accompt of profit and lofs.
4thly, Even all the perfonal accompts with your Drs. and
Crs. in order as, they lie, and bear the nett reft of them feverally to balance.
5thly, Even your voyages, your fadors' accompts,
wherein is either gain or lofs,_ and bear the nett gain or
lofs to the accompt of profit and lofs; and the goods unfold
to balance.
6thly, Even the accorapt of profit and lofs, and bear the
nett reft to flock or capital, as an advance to your flock or
capit4.       -
Sthly, Even your ftock, and bear the nett ref to' balance Cr.
Then catl up the Dr. and Cr. fides of your balance: and,
if they come both alike, then are your accompts well kept i
pthierwife, you muft find out your error by pricking over
your books again, to fee wxhether you have entered every Dr.
and Cr. in the ledger as you ought.
Note, By pricking over the book is meant, an examining'every article in the journal, againit the ledger, and marking
it thu -, or thust; arid, upon the fecond examination
thus t; and, upon a third examination thus tl, or-any othermark'
Note alfQ, In all accompts of goods, you muft keep a column in the midd-le of the leaf, of each fide, for number,
weight, and meafure.
Though all that hath been faid in relation to book-'keeping, and the feveral rules thereunto belonging, may
feem a little abftrufe to the sltogether unlearned therei.n,
yet there is no fuch mighity difficulty to inftrucCt them as
they may imagine; for thife following hints may rendx-froung.Man's  B.f  Companion. W69
&lt;,hat hatk.been already faid irntelligible to an ordinary ca
pacity.
I t, Stick clofe to the text, or general rule before mentioned, viz. That all things received, or the receiver, ar-e
debtor to all things delivered, or the deliverer; for this rule
holds goods in all cafes.
2dly, When the Dr. (Awhether perfon or goods) is
known, the Cr. is eafily underflood, without mentioning
it: for, if A be Dr. to B, then B. is Cr. by A, for
what fum foever it be: alfo, if goods be Dr. to.C, then
C is Cr. by thofe goods, for the fum they amount to.
This I mention, becaufe that moft authors (if not all that
I have met with on the fubjed of book-keeping) fpend a
great many words, which I think (begging their pardon
if I err) might be faved, in declaring the creditor, as well
as fihewing the debtor, when it may be underifood, as
aforefaid.
3dly, This art of Italian book-keeping, is called bookBeeping by double entry, becaufe there muff be two entries;.the firif, being a cliarging of a perfon, mone,ey or.goo.ds; and the fecond, a difcharging of a perfon, money,'
or goods.
4thly, Stri&amp;dly note, That if the firft entry be on the
Dr. or left-hand fide of your ledger, the next, or fecond
entry muff always be made on the right or credit-fide of
y'our ledger; for, whenever one perfon or thing is charged,
th4n, always, another perfon or thing is difcharged for the.
faid fum, let it be what it will.
And fo it is in balancing or evening an accornpt, and car-.
rtying it to -another folio; tfor, if the old accompt be evened'by the balance on the credit-fide, then the new Icompt:
mutff be debited-or charged on the debit-fide, for; -the fum
that balanced the old' accompt.
Much more might be faid on this art of book-keeplkng
if I had room; bnt, I have plainly fpoke to the principal fundamentals thereof, whllich, I ht)pe, may be f:ffici-.
ent for the inffitEtion alnd imp1roveiment of any inttlligetn
reader.

Notes on Bills of Exchange.
r. The accepter of any bill is become abfolute debtor
to the perfon to whom the bill is payable for the contents
thereof.
T. The perfon to whom the bill is payable, mlft demand
the money the very day it becomes due; and if the accepter
die before it becomes due, it mul: be demanded of the exeo
cutor or adminiftrator.
3..The drawer of any bill muff always give his correLf
pondent a letter of advice, that he hath drawn fuch a bill on
hiin for fuch a fum, &amp;c.
4. None may pay a bill without fuch a letter of-advice.
5. In England a bill is due the third day after the expil
mtion of the time mentioned in the bill.
QfIndor/ing,
It frequently happens, than between the aeceptance of
- bill, and the time of payment, the party to whom it
is firft made payable, hath occafion to pay it away; if fo,
he writes his name on the bacik of the bill, which is hij
Order (as faid before) and gives it to the perfon he is i1debted to, and then he is emp-owered to receive the molney: and-it may be, the fecond perfon alfo wants to pay
it away; and then he writes his name likewife under thberoung lMan's /edJ Companion.       185' ther, ancl delivers it to a third perfon to receive the money; and it may be the third does the fame, and delivers it
to a fourth perfon, &amp;c. All that do fo are indorfers: and
he that laft hath the bill, if the accepter will not pay it,
may fue him, or the indorfers, or drawer, or any -of them,
for the money.
Art irtdorfement is generally in thefe words, viz. Pay the
contents of the within-mentioned bill to Henry Flafiy.
GEORGE GREEDY.
But generally the name only is accounted fufficient.
Of Protefiing..
When a bill is to be prote{ted, the party that hath the'bill muft go to a Public Notary (not a common Scrivenef)
whofe bufinefs it is; and he goes with you to the accepter's
houfe, and demands payment, &amp;c, And then he draws up
a Proteft according to law;, which is to be returned to the
drawer within the time iritnted, &amp;c,
It is needlefs to give here the form of a Proteft, becaufe
no man can do it himfelf.

figures.  Thefe are by the clerks of the cuftom-houre
entered into feveral books for that purpofe.- If fome
goods pay cuRtom, and others not, then there muft be made
two entries; one for thofe. that pay cuftom,-and another
for thofe that pay not; and likewiie you mullt have two
cockets.
A cocket teRtifies the payment of all duties, and is writ
on a finall piece of parchment, in the following words:
]Know ye, that Edwin Export, merchant, for three cafes
of Hiaberdafhery, and five ttns of beer, in the Loyal Merchant, BWVilliam WVorm, for Barbadoes, hath paid all duties.

pronounced and writte4i.'-HE  defign of this Book being to infirua mankind,
efpecially thofe who are young, in the methods of
converfing, and tran'fadting bufinefs in the world; therefore, that moft neceffary accomplifh'ment of fpelling, and
writing good and proper Englith, claims the firft notice;
for, let a perfon write ever fo good a hand, yet, if he be
defedive in fpelling, he will be ridiculed and contemptibly
f miled at, becaufe his writing fair will render his' orthographical faults the more confpicuous. Therefore,
Firft, Take notice, that of letters are made fyllables, of
fyllables words, and of words fentences, &amp;c.
The letters are in number 26; viz. a, b, c, d,e, f, g, h,
i, j, k, 1, m, n, o, p, q, r, f, t, u, v, w, x, y, Z; of thefe
j and v were formerly wrote i and n, and have, for that
reafon been firequently called i confonant, an.d u confonant;
but they have been of laLe more properly called ja and ve.
In thefe letters we are to obferve their names, their form,
and their force: Their names whereby to know them; their
form, whether great or finall; and their force in pronunciation or utterance.
Letters are diflinguifled according to their found, ioto
vowels and coefonants. A vowel is a letter, that foundeth
by itfelf, and they be fix'in number,. viz. a, e, i, o, u, and
y, the Greek vowel, which is alfo an Engliflh voel wh-en it
cometh after a confonant, and hath the found of i; as in
by, fly, reply, fyllable, &amp;c.; but is never ufed in words

There muft be eight of thefe bills (though but feven outwards) and one of thefe muff-be in words at length (as well
as one of the feven bills outwards) which is for the warrant
of delivery; and muff be fignedlby the perfon in whofe name
the goods are entered; and the mark alfo in the margin;.
which beirng done, and the fee for entry and cu{tom paid,
you will then have froim the land-waiters a warrant for the
landing and receiving your goods.
When goods are to be exported by certificates, viz. foreign goods formerly imported: thefe goods being to b&amp;
fent abroad, or exported to another place or cotuntry by a
native of England, within twelve, or a ftranger within nine
months after importation, entitles the' exporter to a drawback of part of the cuffomr paid at the importation of the
faid goods (producing a certificate from the comptroller,
that they have paid the dufies inwards.)  And the debenture of cuffom- drawback runs thus:

of what you would export, &amp;c.
A  little before was mentioned at what key the goods
ihould be landed, and therefore here it is proper to name
the keys (or rather quays) and wharfs that goods are ufually landed at; which are thefe, viz.
Somer's-key, Smart's-key, Wiggen's-key, Bear-key,.Dice-key, Cuitomhoufe-key, Potter's-key,  Wool-key,
Galley-key, Brewer's-key, Ralph's-key, Cheftei's-key,
Lyon's-key,  Cox's-key,   Hammond's    Young's,   and
Gaunt's keys.   And the wharfs are, Frefli-wharf and
Botolph-wharf.
Befides thefe, there are certain places called docks,
which'are harbours cut into the land, where there is no
current, but only a flow, and an ebb, occafioned by the
rife and fall of the tide in t'he river of Thames: and thefe
are convenient for the laying of veffels, hoys, lighters, barges
and boats, and are thefe, viz.
Billingfgate-dock, Sabb's-dock, Tower-dock, St. Catharine's-dock, VWapping-dock, Hermitage- dock,  Exe.
cution-dock, and Limehoufe-dock. And, above bridge,
Q~eenhithe-dock, Puddle-dock, Whitefriar's-dock, and
Scotland-yard-dock. And, on Southwark, or Surryfide,
are Saviour's-dock, Clink-dock, and Savery's-dock, below
the Bridge-yard, and feveral others for private ufes.  But
more particularly eminent on that fide the water, is the
Bridge-yard, for landing fundry forts of merchandifes, but
chiefly from the ports of England.
Of WlVharfage and Lighterage.
Wharfingers have feveral managers over them, and alfo
a committee to redref3 grievances, &amp;c. and clerks of theftations, with lighter managers, and have the letting of many
warehouLfes (which now are very fine and commodious, being rebuilt fince the fad fire in Thames- treet) cellars, &amp;c.
and have the privilege of keeping-lighters for the carriage of
goods to and from fhips.roUzng Man's. Be? Conzpaniot
Tle Rates of Whnarfage
Are generally computed at 12zd. per tun, whether- outt
ward-or inward; excepting fugars from the Weft-Indies,
which pay 2S. per tun, 4 hogfheads being accounted a tun
(though they weigh more;) cranage is included in the 12dd
per tun wharfage; and for lighterage, the wharfingers have
I2d. for 4 liogfheads of fugar that come from the WeftIndies; and for wine and other goods, the lighIterage is
half as much as the wharfage,
Hujbands of Ships,
Where feveral perfons are coIlcerned in a fhip, there is
ufually a hufband chofen by them; to take an accompt of
every merchant's goods, &amp;c. and pay the wharfage, lightcrage, porterage, &amp;c.; and thefe hufbands are to colleat
every merchant's proportion, when they do the owner's
freight.
Of Menfuration of Planes and Solids,
The feveral kinds of meafuring are three, viz.
lit, Lineal, by fome called Running Meafure, and is
taken by a line, and refpeds length without breadth; the
parts of which are,
I2 inches T foot, 3 feet I yard, i6 feet and an half I rod,
pole, or perch.
All kinds of ornamental work, fuch as cornice, freeze,
&amp;c. are meafured by running meafure.
2dly, Superficial, or Square Meafure, is that which refpe(&amp;s length and breadth; and the parts are,
i44 inches I foot, 72 inches half a foot, 36 inches one
quarter of a foot, 18-inches half a quarter of a foot, 272
feet and a quarter, one rod, 136 feet half a rod; 1296
inches, or 9 feet, one fuperficial or fquare yard.
3dly, Solid, or Cube Meafure, which refpeds lengthb
breadth and depth, or thicknefs; and the parts are,
1728 inches I foot, 1296 inches'three quarters of a foot,
864 inches half a foot, 432 inches one quarter of a foot, and
g7 feet folid yard.

g19zroung Man's Beft Companion.             193
as board, glarf, pavement, wainfcot, and land, is to take
the dimenfions of the length and breadth according td the
cultomary method ufed in each particular; for inftance,
board and glafs are meafured by the foot, the dimenfions
are taken in feet and inches, and the content given in
feet.
The dirnenfions of wainfcoting, and paving, plaffering,
and painting,, are taken in feet and inches, anid the content
given' in yards.
Of t/e Square and Siupericial Conten.t or Area.
The fquaring of any number, is multiplying it into itfelf,
as 12 inches multiplied6 by 12 inches, make i44 fquare
inches.  I'he fuperficial content, or area, of any thing is
found four feveral ways, viz. by whole numbers, by decimals, by pradice, and by crofs multiplication; in each of
which methods I fball give examples of operation.
A fquare hath its lides perpendicular and equaL
An oblong hath its fides perpendicular, and thofe that are
oppofite equal; but the adjacenlt fides are un,equal; boards,
wainfcots, ceilings, windows, doors, &amp;c. are commonly of
this figure.
-When any thing is to be meafured, it mufl be confidered
what form or fafllion it is of; and then it muft be meafuredl
according to the feveral rules for eachl figure.
Firit, If it be a fquare or oblong, then the length and
breadth muff be multiplied one by the other, which gives
the content in fquare meafure, and that produ' muff be
divided by its proper divifor, according to the name in which
the content or area is to be given.
Example.

A Rule for difparch.
If the length of a board, or piece of glafs, be given in
feet, and the breadth in inches, multiply the one by the
other (without any redudion) and divide the produd by
I2, and the quotient will be the anfwer in feet, and the
remainder will be parts of a foot. So the foregoing example might have been done fooner, by dividing 96 the length
by Ii the breadth, and it quotes 8 feet for the content, as
by the former way.

If a board be wider at one end than the other, then take
the breadth in the middle, or add the meafure of both ends
together, and take the half for the mean breadth, which
multiply by the length.

Proper Direaions for Joiners, Painters, Glaziers, &amp;c.
Rooms being various in their forms, take this general
rule in all cafes, viz.
Take a line, and-apply one end of it to any corner of the
room; then meafure the room, going into every corner with
the line, till you come to the place where you fitfi began;
then fee how many feet and inches the firing con.tains, and
fet it down for the cornpafs or round; then take the height
by the fame method.

When the wainfcot of a room is painted, you are to meafure round the room with a line, as'hinted before, and the
height is to be taken by girting a ftring over all the mouldings from the top of the cornice to the floor; then multiply

their-end.  A confonant is a letter that foundeth not, ex.
cept it be joined with a vowel, for without one of the
vowels no fyllable can be made; as, b, c, d, &amp;c. without
the aid of a vowel, cannot be founded. Thoughl we have
twenty-fix letters, and fix of them vowels, yet we have
twenty-one confonants; for y, when fet before any vowel,

as, in join, jangle, jingle, &amp;c.
Whleln two vowels cpome or meet together in a fyllable,

Sacwers' WIork.
In this place it may not be improper to fay fomething
in relation to the method ufed by fawers, in meafuring
their work. When they work by the great (as they fay)
molt commonly they meafure their work by the fuperficial
foot, fo there is no great difficulty in taking the dimenfions; for they account the depth of the kerf for the
breadth, and the length for the length.  The dimenfions
being thus taken in feet, the content of one kerf fuperficial may be found by multiplying the length by the breadth;
and then having found the number of feet in one kerf, mulIroung Man's BeJf Companion.
tiply it by the number of kerfs of the fame dimenfions, and
you will have the number of feet in them all.
Note tit, When thus they have caft up the whole content
of their work in feet, they are paid for it by the hundred,
that is, Ioo feet.
2dly, That if the kerf be but 6 inches or lefs in depth,
then they have a cuftonom to be paid for kerf and half (as
they exprefs it) i. e. for half fo much more as it comes to,
by meafure; and the reafon, they give for it is, that the
trouble is fo much the more, on account o  ften fhiftiTig
or removing and new binding their timber and, theIefore,
they infift on it as a cuftomary price.
3dly, For breaking-work, that is for cutting a piece of
timber or tree throtgh the middle, and flabbing it (i. e.
cutting off the outfide pieces) if the kerf be more than I2
or ~ 3 inches deep, they are paid by the foot lineal or running meafure, at different prices, according to the various
depths of the kerf; and are as follows:

4thly, In fome places it is cutornary to allow the fawer
but one breaking kerf in a tree, though there be n,ever fo
many kerfs deep in it.  But fome fawers claim to have
half breaking-work, and half hundrcd-work; that is, if
they have four kerts deep, then they will'have two breakingwork, and the other two hundred-work.

Walling is meafuired by the rod ftatute-me.afure, being
272 feet arid ~ filperficial. The method of taking their
dimenfions is thus: for a wall round an orchard, or the
like, they meafure the length by a line, going over the
buttreffes; and for the height they meafure over the mouldings (preffing the line into them) even to the middle of the
coping: they likewife take notice of the thicknefs of the
wall, that is, how many half bricks in length the wall is in
thicknefs; for three half bricks, that is, a brick in length,
and one in breadth, is ftandard thicknefs; and all walls,
Whether lefs or more, muft be reduced to that thicknefs,
by this rule, viz. Multiply the produE  of the length and
height,'by the number of half bricks that the wall is in
thicknefs; which produf&amp; divide by 3, and then the quotient by 272 (the X being generally negle&amp;ed in vulgar
working) and the quotient will be rods, at a brick and a
half thick fftandard-meafure.
Example.

Of Chimneys.
This brick-work is commonly agreed for by the hearth,
and alfo fometimes by the rod; and the method of taking
dimenfions is thus: if the chimney tfands fingly, not leaning againft, or being in a wall, and worked upright over
the mantle-tree, to the next floor; it is girt about the
breaft for the length, and the height of the flory is taken
for the breadth and the thicknefs of the jambs for the
thicknefs.  But, if the chimney ftands againft, or in, a
wall, which is before meaftired with the reft of the building, then the breadth of the breaft or front, together with
the depth of the two jambs, is the length; the height of
the ftory the breadth, and the thicknefs of the jambs the
thicknefs. But, if the chimney ifands in the corner of aroung Man~'s Bef Companion.             207
room, and has no jambs, then the breadth of the breaflt is
the breadth; the height of the ftory the length, and the
thicknefs the thicknefs.  And for the fhaft, it is commonly
girt in the fmalleft part, for the length; and the thicknefs
of both fides, for the thicknefs; in confideration of the
widths, pargiting, fcaffolding, &amp;c.
Note, There is nothing to be dedu&amp;'ed for the vacancy
between the hearth and the mantle-tree, becaufe of the
widths and the thickening for the next hearth above.

er In tiling and flatlng,. where there are gutters and
valleys, there is commonly an allowance, which is to take
the length of the roof all along upon the ridge, which
makes the gutter double meafure; which, in fome places,
is allowed, in others not.  Sometimes there is an addition
for hollow  ware, that is, ridge-tiles, gutter tiles, corner
an-d dormar tiles; and here cuffoms differ: for, in fome

Of Timber Meafure.
When at any time you would know the content of any
piece of timber, by vulgar or decimal arithmetic, obferve
what follows, viz. The tree being girted, and one fourth
part taken for the fide of the fquare; multiply the length
of the fide of the fquare in inches into itfelf, and that pro.
duta by the lefigth in feet; which laft produd divide by
144; but, if you multiply by the length, in inches, then
your divifor muft be 1728: and if any thing remains,- divide fuch remainder by- I 2, and the quotient will be the odd
inches.

Of a Circle.
Figure the ninth.
A circle is contained under one line, called the circumference or periphery, as A B C.  All right lines drawn
from the centre E to the circumference, are equal, and called
radiufes, or half diameters; and the long line through the
centre from A to C is the diameter.
To divide a circle in fix equal parts, extend the compaffes to half the diameter, as from A to the centre E,
and the extent applied to the circumference will divide it
into thofe parts.
The diameter A C divides the circle into two equal
parts, each of which is called a'emicircle; and, if a femicircle be divided into two equal parts, thofe parts are called
quadrants.
The queffions relating to the meafuring of the circle and
its parts may be folved as follows:

There is a near fort of kindred -or affinity between thb
art of meafuring of timber, and that of gauging or mea?
furing of liquors; for both'are performed by cube or, folid
rneafure, and, therefore, not improper clofely to follow
one another.   For, as often as there are found  7i28 folidc

wine; but, in that, the divifor alters, it being 231 folid or
cubic inches..
And the gallon of dry meafure contains 272~ cubical

Note, Every cubical foot, in beer or ale meafure, eontains 6 gallons and almoft a pint.
The fame in wine meafure is 7 gallons and almoft 2

A cubical foot of dry meafure contains 6 gallons, and

The ExtraSion of the Square and Cube Roots, of great ufe in
Meafuring, Gauging, &amp;c.
The Square Root.
I,t A fquare number arifeth from the multiplication of
a number into itfelf, the number fo multiplied being called
ttie root; thus, 4' multiplied by; 4, produceth I 6; fo I 6 is
a fquare number, and 4 is the root thereof; fo alfo 4 is the
fquare of 2, for twice 2 is 4, and 9 is the root of 8s, for 9
times 9 is 8 I, &amp;c.
2dly, To extra&amp; the fqiuare root of any number, is to
find another number, which multiplied by (or into) itfelf,
produces the number given; and after the root is found,
fuch a multiplication is'a proof of the work.
3dly, Square numbers are either fingle or compound.
4thly, All the fingle fquare numbers, with their refpective roots, are contained in the following table, viz.
Roots.    It   2 1.3 | 4 1 5 1 6 f 7 18 [ 9
Squares.        41 9     6 125   36 149 64   8
5thly, When the fquare root of any numnber lefs than
Ioo is required, and that number is not expreffed in the
table above; then you are to take the root of that fquare
number in the table, which (being lefs) comes the neareft'
to the given number. Thus, if the fquare root of 50 were
required, then, fince 49 is the neareft fquare number in the
table, therefore, its root 7 will be the root of the given number nearly.
6thly, A compound fquare number, is that whiclh is
produced by a number confifting of more places than one,

right-hand, omitting one place, as above; and if the
places of decimals are odd, affix a cipher towards the righthand of them to make them even.    Your number thus
prepared, draw a crooked line on the right of the number,
as in divifion: and indeed the operation of the fquare root
is not much unlike divifion; only there the divifor is fixed, and, in the fquare root, we are to find a new one for
each operation.  I fay, having made a crooked line thus
45796(, feek, in the foregoing table for the neareft fquare

figure placed in the root, produces 1696;, equal with the
dividend or refolvend aforefaid, as in the operation may
be feen. Therefore, the fquare root of 45796 is 214; for
214 multiplied into itfelf, produces 45796, the number

Note further, If any remainder happen to be after extra&amp;ion, you may proceed by annexing pairs of ciphers to

you pleafe.
Note alfo, Such numbers given for extra&amp;ion that leave
remainders, are, by fome, called irrationals, becaufe their

The Extration of the Cube RootTo extra&amp;: the cube root of any number, is to fimd another number, which, multiplied by itfelf, and that produ&amp;~ by the number found, produces the numbergiven for

The Second method.
Admit B be the point given on which to draw the perpendicular B I. Open the compaffes to any convenient
diftance; and fetting one foot on the point B, pitch down
the other foot at random, as fuppofe at K; then the foot
reflting in K, turn the other about till it crofs the line A B
in L; then draw the line K L, and continue,the fame beyond K, fetting off the fame diftance K L (at which the
compaffes already ftand) from K to M: fo a line drawn
from B, through M, will be the perpendicular required.

Of parallel lines there are two forts, viz. ftraight or

greater or leffer one than the other, are- faid to be parallel
or concentric, that is, having one common centre.  See
figure I7.
In this figure, the circle A  B C D  is concentric, or
parallel to the circle E F G H, becaufe both of them  are

Horw to make a line of chords geometrically to any afigned
length or radius.
Since, in the art of dialing, there is frequent ufe made
of the line of chords, it is proper here to fhew the making
thereof.
A line of chords is 9o degrees of the arc of a circle,
transferred from the limb of a circle to a ftraight line;
now evety circle, whether great or fmall, is divided (or
fuppofed fo to be) into 360 equal parts, called degrees:
fo the femi or half circle contains 18o, the quadrant or
quarter 90, and the radius or femi-diameter (which is that
line with wlich the circle or femi-circle is drawn or defcribed) is always equal to 60 degrees of that circle which
it defcribes, and, therefore, 60 degrees of a line of chords;
is called the radius thereof.
7To make the line of chords; as in figure 20.
Firft, draw a line of any length, as C B D, and on the
middle thereof ere&amp; the perpendicular A  B.  Next opearoung Man's BeJd Companion. 55
your compaffes to the radius or length that you would have
your line of chords be of; which admit A B, and with
that diftance on B as the centre, defcribe or draw the femicircle C A D, which is divided into two equal parts or
quadrants by the perpendicular line A B. Thirdly, divide the arc or quadrant A D, into go equal parts or degrees; which is done by taking the length of the line A
B, and fetting that diftance on the quadrant A D, and
from D to R; fo is D R 6o degrees, and A R 30 degrees; then take the diftance A R, and fet it from D to
8, fo is the quadranrt-divided into three equal parts, at the
points S and Ri each containing 30 degrees; this done,
divide the feveral fpaces between A R, R S, and S D,
into three equal parts, each of which will be Io degrees,
according as the numbers are feen and fet apart to them;
and thefe again divided into two equal parts, each part
contains five degrees, and every one of thefe into five fmaller, as in the reprefentation; and fo the whole quadrant is
divided into go degrees. Fourthly, the quadrant A R S D
being thus divided into go degrees, fet one foot of the
compaffes in D, and open the foot to A, and defcribe the
arc A E F, touching the line C D in F, fo is the point
F, upon the right line C D, the chord of go90 degrees.
Fifthly, open the compaffes from D to So degrees, and
defcribe the arc 80 G H; fo fhall the ppint H be the
chord of 80 degrees. Sixthly, open the compaffes from
ID to 70, defcribe the arc 70 1 K, fo is K the clhord' of 70
degrees. Again, open the compaffes from D  to R, the
xadius, or 60 degrees, and defcribe the arc R L B, fo is
B the chord of 60 degrees, equal to the radius. Do the
fame by 50; 40, 30, 20, and IO, and then you will have the
line-D F divided into 90 unequal parts, called chords, as infigure 20.
Thus much for the line of chords frequently made ufe of
in dialing, where there is not the conveniency of having a
mathematical infirument-maker near at hand.
Note, A degree is the 360th part of the globe, or of any
circle: each of which degrees is fuppofed to be divided into
60 parts, called minutes; fo that 45 minutes is three quarters,of a degree, and 30 minutes half a degree, and IS minute8 one quarter of a degree.roung Al an's BeJf  Companiom

parts or inches, and every one of thofe parts or inches fubdivided into half inches, and each of thofe halves into

inch is divided into eight parts, and the whole length into
192 parts.

By this table it is plain, that if a piece of timber is 6'

a folid foot.
It is a common method with carpenters to add the
breadth and thicknefs of a piece of timber in inches together, and call the half thereof the fide of- the fquare of
that piece; but this method gives the.content more than
it is: and the greater the difference, the larger the error.
But the true fquare may be found in Gunter's line, thus:
place one point of the compaffes upon the line at the thicknefs, and the other at the breadth, then half of that extent
will reach from either the breadth or thicknefs to the iide of
the true fquare in inches.

3. CoggeJhcal's Jiding rule.
The next inftrument I Ihall fpeak of, is that which goes
by the name of Coggefhal's fliding rule. And firit of
Its defcription.
This rule is framed three ways; fliding by one another
as the glaziers' rule; fliding,on one fide of a two-foot jointrule; and one part fliding on the other, in a foot of length;
the back-part being flat, on which are fundry lines and
fcales.
Upon the aforefaid fliding fide of the rule, are four
lines of numbers, three are double lines, and one a fingle
line'of numbers marked with A B C and D, the three
marked A   B and C, are called double lines of numbers,
and figured I, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Then I, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, and io at the end. That marked D, is the
fingle line of numbers, and figured 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, to, 20,'30, and at the end 40, even with and under Io, in the double line next to it, and that is called the girt line, and fo
marked in the figure.
The figures on the three double lines, of numbers, may
be increafed br decreafed at pleafure; thus I at the beginning may be called so, Ioo, or00ooo; the 2 is 20, 200, or
2000; fo that when i at the beginning is Io, thern I in the
middle is loo, and Io at the end is Iooo; but, if I at the
beginning is counted for x, then I in the middle is Io, and
io at the end is Ioo.
And as the figures are altered, fo muff the iRrokes or divifions between them- be altered in their value, according
to the number of the parts they are divided into; as thus,
from I to 2, it is divided into ten parts, and each tenth
is divided into 5 parts: and from 2 to 3, it is divided into  o parts, and each tenth into 2 parts, and fo on fron
3 to 5; then from 5 to 6, it is divided into io parts only;roung Man's Bej: Companion.              261
and fo on unto one in the middle of the rule, or the end of
the firft part of the double line of nutnbers. The fecondl
part of the double line is divided like the firft.
The girt line marked D, is divided from 4 to 5 into Io
parts, and each tenth into 2 parts, and fo on from 5 to io:
and then from I o to 20zo, it is divided into Io parts, and each
tenth into 4 parts; and fo on all the way from 20 to 40o at
the end, which is right againat Io at the end of the double
line of numbers.
The lines on the back fide of this rule that flides on one
fide, are thefe, viz. a line of the inch-meafure from I to
I2, each divided into halves, quarters, and half-quarters;
another line of inch-meafure fiomin I to 12, each divided.
into I2 equal parts, and a line of foot-meafuire, being one
foot divided into ioo equal parts, and figured fo, 20, 30,
40, 50, 60, 70, 80o, 9o, and oo, even with 12 o'n inchmeafure.
And the back-fide of the fliding piece is divided into
inches, halves, quarters, and half-quarteis, and figured
from i2 to 24, fo that it m-ay be flid out to 2 feet, to
meafure the length of a tree, or any thing elfe you have o.ccafion to meafure.

Geography is the art of defcribing the figure, magnitude,
and pofition of the furface of the earth and feas, and their
parts.
Many and fufficient arguments may be produced to
prove, that the earth and feas are of a fpherical or globular figure; one of them may be fufficient in this place,' viz.
that ffihips in failing from high capes or head-lands, lofe
fight of their lower parts firit; and continue gradually to.
lofe fight of thofe which are fituated higher and higher.
till at laft the top vanithes; which could not be, unlefs the
furface of the fea were convex: now, this convexity of the
fea is found to-be uniform in all parts thereof, therefore, the
furface- of the waters is. fphe'rical; which being granted, that
of the land muft be nearly fo, becaufe its extremity fets l.X
mnits to the waterso.                             -       -2' oung Man's BeJl Conpanon             z 263
The.whole body of the earth and fea is, therefore, called
the Terraqueous Globe.
Since, as has been before obferved, all circles are di-'vided into 360 degrees, therefore, any great circle furrounding the terraqueous globe, is uifually fo divided.  Our
ingenuous countryman, Mr. Richard Norwood, about the,
year. L635, by an accurate meafurement of the diftange
between London and York, found that a degree of a
great circle was about 69' ftatute miles in length, and
confequently, that the circumference of the terraqueous
globe was 25020'miles; whence its diameter will be 7964
miles.
The fea covers the greater part of the terraqueous
globe, out of which the land rifes with very flow afcents,
the height of the loftieft' mountain thereof being hardly
the four thoufandth part of the above found diameter,
which is but juft fufficient to give the rivers a flow and eafy
defcent,.
Geographers have found it neceffary to imagine certain
circles to be drawn on the furface of the earth, for the better determination of the pofitions of places thereon.
Thefe are either greater or leffer circles; great circles divide the globe into two equal parts, and leffer circles divide
it into two unequal parts.
There are fix kinds of great circles; two of them, viz.
the equator or equinoaial, and the ecliptic, are fixed,
but the others, viz. the meridians, the circles'of longitude, the horizons, and the" vertical circles, are variable,
according to the part of the globe they are appropriated
to.
There are two points on the furface of the terraqnleous
globe, called the poles of the earth, which are diametrically
oppofite to each other; the one is called the north, and the
other the fouth pole.
The equator is that great circle w.hich is equally diftant
from both the above-mentioned poles, and is fo called
from its dividing the terraqueous globe into two- equal
parts; named fiom the poles which are fituated in each,
the northern and fouthern hemifpheres; it is alfo called
gquinoHial,- becaufe, when the fun enters it, the days and.s'`  264           Young Man's BeJ' Companion.
nights are of equal length in all parts of the globe: feamen.
commonly call this circle the line.
Meridials, or circles of terrefirial longitude, are fiupr)ofed
to be drawn perpendicular to the equator, and to pafs thro'
the poles; they are called meridians or mid-day-circles, becaufe, when the fun comes to the meridian of any place, it
is noon or mid-day at that place.
Hence every particular place on the furface or the terraqueous globe hathi its proper meridian, and, confequently, a traveller, who doth not diredtly approach or recede
from obe of the poles, is continually changing. his meridian.
With refpedc to the two circles above defcribed, every
place upon the earth is faid to have. its particular latitude
and longitude.
The latitude of any place upon earth is its diftance fi-om
the equator, in a dire&amp; line towards one of the poles; and,
fince the meridians proceed in fuch (ld'eie   lines, therefore,
latitude is reckoned in degrees, and parts of degrees, on the
meridian of the place.
The longitude of any place upon earth, is the eaft or
weft diftance of the meridian of that place, from  fome
fixed meridian, at which longitude is fuppofed to begin:
now, lince all the meridians pafs thirough the poles, they
coincide with one another at thofe points, and their greatefl;
diftlance from eac'h other will be, when they are fartheft from
thofe points of coincidence, viz. at the equator; therefore,,
longitulde is reckoned in degrees, and parts of a degree, on
the equator,
Geographers have differed very much in the meridian
from whence they have affumed the beginning of a longitude; the ancients chofe the meridian of the Canaries,
which they called the Fortunate Iflands, others have pitched
on the iflands of Azores, or the weitern iflani; but, the
moft ufual way is, now, to reckon longitude fi-om the capital of that country in which an author writes'; an.d, accordingly, the longitude is her.after reckoned from the meridian

every particular place on the furface on the terraqueous
globe-hath its proper parallel of latitude.
There are four of thefe parallels of latitude, that are particularly remarkable; viz. the two tropics, and the two polar
circles; but, for the better explanation of their properties, it
will be neceffary firpf.to define the ecliptic.
The ecliptic is that great circle in which the fun
feems to perform   its annual motion   round the   earth;
this circle makes an angle with the equator of 230 29':
it interfeats in two oppofite points, called the equinodial
points; and thofe two points in the ecliptic which are
fartheft from the equinodial points are called the foltlitial
points.
The tropic of Cancer is a parallel of latitude 230 zg9
diftant from the equator in the northern hemilphere, paffing
through the northern folftitial point of the ecliptic above' defcribed:. and
The tropic of Capricorn is a parallel of latitude, as far
diftant in the fouthern hemifphere, pafling through the
fouthern folftitial point.
The ar&amp;6ic polar circle is a parallel of la.it-ude 23~ 29'
diflant from the north pole.; and the antar&amp;ic pl(.K-;r circle is
a parallel of latitude as far diftant from the fouth ooiv.
The tropics and polar circles divide the globe ire(3 five
parts, called Zones, that is to' fay, girdles or belts. one
of them  is called the Torrid: two, Temperate; and two,
Frigid.
The torrid zone, fo called. from the great heat of the fun
(which is vertical, or paffes dire&amp;ly over the heads of the
inhabitants twice in a year) is fituated between the two
tropics, and is, therefore, about 4-7 degrees in breadth;
the inlhabitants are called Amphifcians,- that is, fuch as,
have their fhadows caft both ways; the fiin being Teen at
noon fometimes to the north, and at other times to the fouth
of them.,The northern temperate zone is fituated between thetropic of Cancer and the ari{ic polar circle; and the fouth,.
ern temperate zone, between the tropic of Capricorn and
the antardic polar circle; they are each of them  ab'ut 43
degrees broad; the inhabitants are called Heterofcians,
that is, fuch as have their fhadow but one way; for, at266           roung.Man3 Befl Companzon  
noon, the fhadows of the inhabitants of the northern tem.
perate zone, are always caft northward; and thofe of the
inhabitants of the fouthern, fouthward.
The frigid zones contain all that fpace between the polar
circles and the poles themfelves; the northern frigid zone,
being furrounded by the arEiic circle, and the fouthern by
the antaraic, the inhabitants are called Perifcians, becaufe
(when the fun is on the fame fide of the equator as thofe
inhabitants are) their fhadows are (in the fpace of 24 hours)
cadft off all lides, or quite round them.  The fun does not
fet in the places within thefe zones, during feveral fucceffive
revolutions or days in thie fummer: and, in the winter, he
doth not rife for a like fpace of timne.  At the poles them.
felves, the fun is vifible for half of the year, and invifible for
the other half.
If any place on the globe (except the poles and equator)
be particularly confidered, there will be three other places
on the famie meridian, which have more immediately a relation thereto, viz. i. That place which has the fame latitude
on the other fide of the equator; the inhabitants of this
place are called Antaeci, or Antoecians; they have mid-day
and mid-night at the fame times with thole of the place
affumed, but the feafons of the year are different, the fummrer of the one being the winter of the other.
2. That place which is on the fame parallel of latitude9
but is iSo degrees different in longitude; the inhabitants of
this place are called Perxeci, or Periaecians; they have fummer and winter at the fame times with thofe of the place
affumed, but the times of the day are different, the mid. day
of the one being the mid-night of the other.
3. T'hat place which has the fame latitude on the other
fide of the equator, and is L8o degrees different in longitude; this place is diametrically oppofite to the place
affumed; its inhabitants are called Antipodes, and their
feafons of the year, as well as times of the day, are totally
oppofites.
The horrizon is -that great circle which divides the upper
or vifible hemifphere of the world, fraom the lower or invifible; the eye of the fpeaator being always in the centre of
his horizon.  Hence, every particular place on the terra,
queoius globe hath a different horizon; and, confequently,rozing Man' BeJf Comnpanion.            267
a traveller proceeding in any dire&amp;ion, is continually change.
ing his horizon.
The circle is, by mariners, divided into four quarters,
containing go degrees: the four points quartering this circle are called cardinal points, and are named eaft, weft,
north, and fouth; the eaft and welt are thofe points, on
which the fun rifes and fets when he is in the equinoaial;
and the north and fouth points are thofe whiclh coincide
with the meridian of the place, and are direded toward the
north and foutli poles of the world.
Eaclh quarter of the horizon is farther divided into eight
points, wlhich are very neceffary to the geographer, for the
diftinguifning the limits of countries; but the ufe of thefe
divifions- is much more confiderable w,hen applied to the
mariner's compafs. ~
Before the invention of this excellent and moft ufeful inftrument, it wasufulal in long voyages to fail by, or keep
along the coaft, or at leaft to have it in fight; as is manifell and plainly evident, by the voyages of St. Paul, AAs
xx.. 3. and xxvii. 2.;. which made their voyages long and
very dangerous, by being fo near the ihore.  But now, by
the help of a needle, touched by the magnet or loadftone,
which by a wonderful and hidden quality, inclines its point
always northerly, the ingenious mariner is direded in his
proper courfe of failing, through the vaft ocean, and unfathomable depths, to his intended port: and, if the wind is
favourable, can fail near 333 leagues, or iooo miles in a
week, though in the darkeit weather, or darkett night,
when neither, land, noon, nor tars are to be feen; which,
beforf, were the only guide; and, if not feen, the failors were at great lofs, and expofed to the molt imminent
danger.

The tertaqueous globe, or globe of the earth and waters, is divided, by nature, into continents, iflands, peninfulas, ifthmufes, mountains, promontaries or capes, hills and,
valleys: oceans, feas, lakes, gulfs or bays, flraits, ports or
harbours, and rivers; rocks, fhelves, banks, marfhesj and
bogs.
A continent, called formetimes the i-tain-land; is a large
tra&amp; of land conrtaining feveral contiguoas countries, em-n
pires, kingdoms, or Piates.
An ifland is a piece of land wholly furrounded by the
ocean, fea, or other water, apd fo divided from the continent.
A peninfula, (that is to' fay, almoft an ifland) is a piece
of land acompaffed by water, except on one fide, where it is
joined to.tbe'continent or other land.
An ifthmus is that neck or narrow piece of land that joins
a peninfula to the continent..A mountain is a part of the earth which is confiderably
higher or more elevated than other lands near it.
A promontory is a mountain running out into the fea,
the extremity of which is called a cape or head-land.
A  hill is a leffer kind of mountain; and a valley is that
land which is fituated at the bottom of a mountain or hill,
or between two or more fuch.
The ocean is a vaft body of falt water, which feparates.
fome of the continents, and waflhes their borders or flores.
A fea is a branch of the ocean flowing between fomeparts of the coritinents, or feparating idands from them.
A lake is-a body of water every where furrounded by the
land.
A  gulf or bay is' a part of the ocean or fea contained
between two fhores, and is encompaffed by the land except on one fide, where it communicates with the other
waters.
A  ltrait is a narrow paffage whereby feas, gulfs, and.bays, communicate with the ocean, or with one another.
A port or harbour is a part of the ocean or fea fo inclofed
by the land, that flips may ride in fafety therein.
A river is a running water defcending in a narrow channel from the mountains or other high lands, and emptying
itfelf into fonie ocean, fea, lIke, or other river.roilng 3Man's Be   Companion.           27
Rocks are great ftones; lfielves and banks are eminences
confifting of ftones, fands, or other mnatter which obftrunt the
paffage of fhips at fea, and often prove fatal to thofe who do
not keep clear of themn.
Marflies are, lands lying low, which are liable to be overflowed by the fea or rivers: and bogs are mixtures of land.
and water, over or among which it is dangerous to attempt
a paffage.
The known parts of the earth are commonly dividedcl
into four parts, viz. Europe, Afia, Africa, and America;
the firit three were known to the ancients, and are, for
that reafon, called the old world; the fourth was difcovered
about 300 years ago, and is, therefore, called the new
world.
The land which lie towards the north and fouth poles
are very little known; that toward the north is called
Terra Ard&amp;ica, and that toward the fouth pole Terra Antardica, or Terra Auftralis incognita; the latter is fiippofed, by fome,.to be nearly as big as Europe, Afia, and
Africa.
The ocean affumes different names, in different, parts of
the earth; and the feas, gulfs, and bays, are named, moftly,
from the lands to which they adjoin; it is thought, therefore, moft conveniept, in this fhort flcetch, to ddefribe the
lands and waters together; and firft of

Europe contains the following empires, kingdoms, regions, or flates, viz. Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Turky,
Great Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Mufcovy.
OF SPAIN AND PORTUGAL.
Spain,and Portugal arle furrounded by the fea on three
fides; on the fouth and fouth-eaft by the Mediterranean,
which communicates with the weftern or Atlantic ocean by
the ftraits of Gibraltar; on the weit, by the faid ocean;
and, on the north, by the fame, or a part therefore, called
the Bay of Bifcay; on the north-eatt by the Pyrenean mountains, which (reaching from the Mediterranean to the Bay of
Bifcay) feparate it from France.
Portugal is now a kingdom feparate from Spain, to which
it was heretofore fubje&amp;; it is fituated on the ocean, which
wafhes it on the weft and fouth; it has Galicia on the north;
and borders upon Leon, Old Cattile, NSew:CafRile, and Andalufia, on the weft; it is hardly 300 miles in length from
north to fouth, and about too in breath.  The capital city
is Lifbon, which is now in a ruinous condition, being almolt
totally dectroyed by an earthqulake and a fire which fucceeded it in November, 1755.  lhe city of Oporto is alfo
a place of great trade.
Moft of the other provinces of Spain were alfo formerly
feparate kingdoms; fuch were Andalufia, in which Gibraltar is fituated, as are the cities of Seville and Cadiz;

the city and port of Carthagena; Valencia, north-eailwarad
of Murcia; this has a city and fea-port of the fame name,
and another port of great trade called Alicant.
In the inland parts are the kingdoms of Old Caftile, New
Caftile, and Leon; and near the confines of France, thofe
of Arragon and Navarre; the principal cities of Old Caftile
are Burgos and Valladolid; of New Caftile, Madrid, the
king's refidence, and Toledo; of Leon, Salamanca and
Leon; of Arragon, Saragoffa; and of Navarre, Pampelona
and Eftella.
The kingdom of Gallicia is fituated on the ocean in the
north-weft part of Spain; its principal cities are Compoftella, and Corunna, or the Groyne, which ts a feaport; the principality of Afturias gives title to the king
of Spain's eldeit fon; it is fituated eafiward on the bay
3f Bifcay, the principal city is called Oviedo; the province of Bifcay, Rill more eaftward, lies on the bay of that
name, and has two ports of confequence, Bilboa and St.
Sebaftian.

Mediterranean, hd-;fis the moit eaftern province of Spain;
in this is the city and port of -Barceldnna, which is not inferior to any of the above-named. Not far from which are
the. Balearic,ifles, called Majorca, Minorca, and Ivica.
Proceeding eaftward along the ]Mediterranean fea is the
kingdom of France, which is bounded on the eaft by Italyand Getmany, on the north by the Netherlands and the
Englifh channel, on the weft by the bay of Bifcay, and to
the fouth of the Pyrenees, which feparate it from Spain and
a part of the Mediterranean fea.
France confifts -of twelve provinces; the fouthern are
Guienne and Gafcony, whofe chief town is Bourdeaux;
Languedoc, whofe capital is Thouloufe; Dauphiny, whofe
principal city is Grenoble; and Provence, whofe capital is

whofe chief towns are Rouen, Paris, (the capital of the
kingdom) Troyes, and Amiens.
Although the provinces of France have not the fuperb
titles of kingdoms as thofe of Spain have, yet fome of them
are more extenfive, rich, and populous, than forne of thofe
kingdoms.
Italy is divided from France on the weft by the river
Var, and part of the Alps; from Germany on the north by
the'fame mountains called the Alps; and is every where
elfe furrounded by the Mediterranean fea, and the gulf of
Venice, which is a branch thereof.
This country is divided into a great many territories go-.
verned in different manners.
The dukedom of Savoy is fituated partly among the
Alps, the capital of which is Chamberry; and the principality of Piedmont, whofe capital is Turin, are fubjeEt to
the king of Sardinia; the duchies of Milan and Mantua,
whofe capitals bear the fame names, are fubjeact to the
Emperor of Germany; the duchy of Montferat, whofe
capital is called Cafal, and thofe:;of Parma and Modena,
having capitals of the fame name, are governed by their
own dukes; Venice, Genoa, Lucca, and St. Marino,
are the capitals of four reptiblics, called by thofe names;
Trent is governed by its bifhop; Rome and its dependencies by the pope; the grand duchy of Tufcany (the capital of which is Florence) is fubjeAt to the prefent Emperor
of Germany; and Naples, the capital of a-kingdom, fituated at the fouthern extremity, together with the ifland of
Sicily,.from which it is divided by a narrow itrai:t, are fubjeat to the fame king. -The chief city of Sicily is called
Palermo.
There are two other large iflands, Sardinia (whofe capital is Cagliari) fubjeat to its king, and Corfica (whofe

length, ftrength, and ftreight, which could not be founded
without the vowel e or i.. The art of fpelling may be reduced to thefe four following general:rules or heads.
Itf, When a- confonant comes.between two vowels, in dividing the words into fyllables the confonant is joined to
the latter vowel;:as in f{a-ture, na-ture, de-liver, u-nity,
&amp;c.'- except compound words which terminate in ed, en,
eft,:eth, ing, ifh, and ous; as, coaft-ed, gold-en, know-eft,
know-eth, hear-er, fool-ing, bar-bar-ous, ra-ven-ous, and
fub-urbs.
2dly, When two confonants come together in the middle,of a word, they are to be parted, if not proper to begin
a word; as,, num-ber, firan-ger, for-tune, &amp;c. not number, frang-er, fort-une: when the fame confonant is doubled
in a word, the firit belongs to the foregoing, the latter to
the following fyllable, as in the rule above, and in thefe'words, Ab-ba, ac-cord, an-no, ad-der, &amp;c.
3dly, Confonants, that can begin words muft not be parted in the middle; -as, a-gree, be-Riow, re-frain, &amp;c. not
- ag-ree, bef-tow, ref-rain.  Thefe confonants may begin
words, viz. bl, br, ch, cr, dr, dw, fl, gh, gl, gr,, kn, &amp;c.
as, blunt, break, chaw, cry, drawv, dwell, fleth, ghoft, &amp;c.
4thly, When two vowels come together, not making a
diphthong, they muft- be divided, as in vi-al, - va-li-ant,
Li-o-nel, du-el, cru-el, me-te-or, and La-o-di-ce-a.
Some particular notes.
L is doubled in words of one fyllable; as, well, tell,
fwell, hall, wall, fall, will, hill, mill, &amp;c. But in words of
more than one fyllable, the word always terminates with
ingle 1; as, angel, Babel, hurtful, beautiful, and dutiful.
Neither- muA 1 be doubled in alway, alfo, although; not
allway, alfo, allthouigh, &amp;c.  But, words accented on the
laft fyllable,' muff be -excepted fr6om  the role above, viz.
initall, recall, inroll, rebell, repell.
-Y mulff be uftd before the termination ing; as, buying,
lying, carrying, marrying, paving, ftaying, burying, &amp;c.
The long f mutt never be ufed at the end of a word, or
immediately after a fhort or fmall s.
-X  hould be ufed initead of &amp;, where it appears to have278          rToung Man's" Be? Companion.

In St. George's channel, almoft equally diflant, fronm
England, Scotland, and Ireland, is lituated the ifle of Man,
the royalty of which, under the Kings of Great Britain,
was formerly in the family of the Stanleys Earls of Derby;
but, the male iffue of that family being extin&amp;, it was afterwards enjoyed by the Duke of Athol, who is -defcended
from the fame by a female branch; and, being bought from
him, is now annexed to the crown.
The Britannic ifes, above defcribed, are feparated from

Germany on. the weft, and, on the other fides, the Turklfih
emti    the- chief city is called Buda; other confiderable
cities are Prefburgh, Raab, Zygeth, Canifia, Alba Kegalis, Gran, Strigonium, Peft, Temefwaer, &amp;c. all famous in
hiftory on account of the contefts between the Chrifiians and
Turks, for the fovereignty of this kingdom.
It is at prefent under the dominion of the Emperor of
Germany.
Poland is a large eledtive kingdom, bounded on the eaft
by Crim Tartary and Mufcovy; on the north by part of
Mufcovy and the Baltic fea; on the weft by Germany; and,
on the fouth, by Hungary, and part of Turky; the capital
city is called Warfaw.
Denmark and Norway, two kingdoms under the fame
fovereign, are bounded on the north and weft by the ocean,
on the fouth by part of Germany and the Baltic fea, and,
on the eait, by Sweden: the capital of Denmark is called
Copenhagen; and that of Norway, Bergen.
Svwede.n has Denmark on the weft, the Baltic fea on thle
fouth, Mufcovy on the eaft, and the ocean on the north;
the chief city is called Stockholm.
Mufcovy, or Ruffia, hath part of Sweden and the Baltic fea on the weft, Poland and Crim Tartary on the fouth,
Great Tartary in Afia on the eaft, and the ocean on thenorth; the ancient capital is called Mofcow; but the refi-:dence of the court is now generally at Peterfiburgh on the'Baltic fea. This empire is very extenfive, being near as
big as all the refl of Europe.
Afia is feparated from Europe toward the north-weft by
the boundaries above defcribed; toward the fouth-wef -by
the eaftern part of the Mediterranean fea, and by the iflhmus of Suez and the Red fea, which divide it from Africa; it is bounded on the fouth by the Indian ocean, on the
eaft by the Pacific, and on the north by the northern or
frozen ocean. Its dimenfions may be copceived from what
follows; Holy Cape, on the northern ocean, in lat. 720
32' N. long. 1790 45' E. bears from the eaftern point of
Java, one of th-e Indian feas, in lat. 80 3 o'S. long. i ~

-It feems moft regular to divide this large country according to its prefent poffeffors, the Grand Seignior or emperor
of the Turks, the Sophy or king of Perfia, the Great Mogul,
pnd the other potentates of India, the emperor of China, and
the potentates of Tartary.
The Turks' poffeffions in Afia are Anatolia, Syria, Ara.
bia, Armenia or Turcomania, Georgia and Mefopotamia,
or Diarbeck; of which in their order.
Anatolia, formerly called Afia Minoir, is encompaffcd on
the north, weft, and fouth Iides by the Euxine, the Marmarian, the Archipelago, and the Mediterranean feas; it is
feparated from Syria on the fouth-eait by the mountains
called Taurus, and from Turcomania on the eapt by the ri-.ver Euphrates.
Its prefent fubdivifions are faid to be four, Anatolia
Proper, on the north-weft, its capital city Burfit; Amafia
on the-no:th-eaft, having a capital of the fame name; Cara-mania, on the fouith-weft, its capital Cogni'; and Aladuli,
on the fouth-eaft, its capital Maraz.
Syria, called by the Turks Suriftan, is generally fub.
divided into Syria Proper, Phmonicia, and Paleftine or
Judea; whofe chief' cities are Aleppo, pamafcus, and
Jerufalem.
Arabia (a country which preferves its ancient name, as
do theinhabitants their wandering difpofitiofn) is bounded
on the weft by the Red fea, and ifthmus of Suez; on the
north by PalePtine, Syria, and Diarbeck; on the ealt by the
Pei'fian gulf; and on the fouth-eaft by the Arabian fea, a
part of the Indian ocean.
It is divided into three parts, called the Defart, the
Stony,, and the Happy; the two firft lie to the northward,
the other to fouth.
There are very few towns in the defart or flony parts of
this country, the Arabs living in tents, and removing with
their families from place to place, as profit or convenience
fuggeft. But, in Arabia Happy (one of the fineft countries
in the world) there are feveral of note, fuch as Medina,
where the fepulchre of Mahomet, the founder of the
TtSrkifk religion is; Mecca,  his birth-place, to which300           roung Man's Be.Jf Companion.
every Turk, or muffulman, is obliged, by that religion, to.
come in pilgrimage once in his lifetime, or to fend another
in his ftead; Aden, a place of traffic, Sana, Mocha, Soar,
and others.
Armenia or Turcomania is bounded on the weft by An-;atolia, on the fouth' by Diarbeck, on the eaft and north
by Georgia and the Euxine fea; its piincipal cities are
Arzerum, Chars, and Van.
Georgia, formerly called Iberia, including Mingrelia, and
Gurgeftan, is bounded on the north by part of Mufcovy, on
the weft by the Euxine fea, on the fouth by Turcomania,
and part of Perfia, and on the eaft by part of Perfia; the
cities of greateft note are Faffo and Tefflis.
Mefopotamia oriDiarbeck is bounded on the north by
Turcomania, on the welt by Syria, on the fouth by Arabia
the Defart, and on the ealt by Perfia; its principal cities are
Diarbeker, Moful, and Bagdat.
Befides thefe large poffeffions, on.the continent of Afia,
the Turks hold feveral iflands in the Archipelago; with
Rodes and Cyprus in the Mediterranean fea, the laft of
which is very confiderable.
The next divifion of Afia, proceeding eaftwardly, is
Perfia; which has the Turkifh dominions on the welt, the
Perfian gulf and part of the Indian ocean on the fouth, the
empire of the Great Mogul on the eaft, and on the north,
part of Tartary, the Cafpian fea, and part of the Mufcovian'empire.
This is a very large country, but at prefent torn to pieces
-by different competitors for the,fovereign power; the capi-tal city is Ifphahan; the mofl confiderable of the' others' are
Derbent on the Cafpian fea,' and Gombroon, and Baffora on
thhe Perfian gulf.
Proceeding filleafiward, the next empire is that of the
Great Mogul, which has Perfia on the weft, the two Indian
peninfulas, and the bay of Bengal, on the fouth, China on
the eaf, and part of Tartary on the north.
This is another large tra&amp;e, with the inland parts of whiich
the Europeans are not much acquainted.
The principal cities are Agra, Lahor, Delhi, Cabul, and
dCafimir; but whether Agra or Lahor is the capital; is,ifficult to determine., as authors do not agree concerning.routg Mant's Be,/ Companion,            3OI
it; it is agreed, however, that the Mogul hath a magnificent
palace at each of thofe cities.
The maritime parts of the continent of India, are divided by the bay of Bengal, a branch of the Indian ocean,
into two peninfutlas, anciently called India, within or: on
this fide the Ganges, and India without, or beyond the
Ganges; befides which two peninfulas, there are feveral
large iflands belonging to India; of all which in their
orders
The peninfula on this fide the Ganges contains feverail
diflin&amp; territories or kingdoms, moft of which either are or
were fubjeA, or at leaft tributary, to the Mogul; the weftern
fide thereof is called the coaft of Malabar, the eaflern the
coaft of Coromandel.
The coaft of Malabar contains feveral European ifttlements; fuch as, Bombay, an ifland belonging to the Englifh Eaft-India Company, and Goa to the Portuguefe, at
each of which they have the fovereignty; and the Englifh
trade at leaft, if they have not forts, at Gazurat, Surat,
Calicut, and Cochin.
The ifland called Ceiland, or Ceylon, by fome called
Zeloan, is fituated a little to the eaft of Cape Comorin,
the mofi fouthern point of this peninfula.
The coaft of Coromandel, which is waffled by the bay of
Bengal, tends toward the north and north-eaft from Cape
Comorin, and extends to the mouth of the Ganges; the
principal fettlements of the Englith on this coaft are,
Madras or Fort St. George, and Fort St. David, near
which the French have a itrong fettlement, called Pondicherry; which neighbouring fettlements have, for fome
time paft, been at war with each other, with various fuecefs, the natives headed by their Princes, called Nabobs,
having taken part therein, fome on one fkde, and fome on
the other.
The peninfula on the other fide of the Ganges, confifit
of the large kingdoms of Bengal, having a capital of the
fame name; Pegu, whofe ctiief cities are Pegu and Arracan; Siam, having'a capital of the fame, name; Malacca,
fituated to the fouth, is almoft compaffed by the fea, and

tra&amp; is fubje&amp; to divers potentates, fome of whom are very
little known.
Africa is a large peninfula, which is joined to the continent of A0fa by the ifthmus of Suez, a narrow defart
between the Mediterranean and Red feas; its magnitude
may be conceived by knowing that the Cape of Good
Hope is in lat. 340 15' Si long. 20~ 7' E. bears from
Ceuta in lat. 35 0 45' N. long. 4c 42' W. S. 18~ I5' E.

Very little of the inland parts of this continent are
known to the Europeans; fo that only the fea coafts will
be mentioned here: beginning at the ifthmus of Suez, and
coalting firit the Mediterranean fea.
Egypt is under the dominion of the Turks; its prefent
capital is called Cairo; the piratical Itates of Tripoly, Tunis, and Algiers, havre capitals of the fame tname; and the
capital of the empire of Morocco is the city of Fez.
Along the cbalfs of the Atlantic ocean, thete are no
extenfive dominions, the inhabitants being motly fubje&amp;t
to petty princes of their own, who' being almoft continually at war with one another, fell their prifoners for
flaves: the Europian nations have been induced, for the
protetion of thei- trade therein, and other commodities, to
ereI feveral'fi-t1l forts in different places, to enumerate
which would be tedious: the Madeiras, the Canaries, and
the Cape de Verde iilnds, are the moft confiderable on,
this coaft; the only ope pofieffed by the Britifh is a very
fmall:one, called St. Helena, frequented by the Eaft-lidia
lips,At the fouthern extremity of this continent is fittated
the Cape of Good Hope, where the Dutch Eat. India
company have built a tolerable town, for the convenience of
their fhipping; from hence again, along the eafern coalt,
both,on the ocean and in the Red fea, very little that is remarkable offers itfelf.
At fome diftance, however, from that part of this coaft304.           -tountg MIarti's Aef Companion
which is waffled by'the ocean, is fituated one of the largef:
iflands in the world, called Madagafcar; which has been, at
different times, the afylum of European pirates.
America, by fome called the new world, becaufe difcovered about 300 years ago, being before that time unknown
to the inhabitants of Europe, ATia, and Africa, is divided
into two remarkable divifions, called North and South
America, which are joined together by the ilthmus of Darien, or Panama.
The fea coaft of North America, and part of the inland
countries, are at prefent fiubjea to the European nations,
and the United American States; the Britiflh poffefs Canada
or New France, whofe capital city is QCebec, fituated on
the great river St. Laurence; Newfoundland, a large ifland
near the mouth of this river.; Cape Breton, a much fmaller
ifland, but well fortified; and the province of Nova Scotia,
the chief town of which is Halifax, are alfo poffeffed by: the
Britifh.

Aftronomy is a fcience: which treats of the motions and
diftances of the heavenly bodies, and of the appearances
thence arifing.
There have been a great variety of opinions among the
p,philofophers of the preceding age, concerning the difpofition of the great bodies in the univerfe, or of the pofition
of the bodies which appear in the heavens: but, the notion
now embraced by the moft judicious aftronomers is, that
the univerfe is compofed of an infinite number of fyftems or
worlds; that in every fyftem there are certain bodies moving
in free fpace, and revolving at different diftances around a
fun, placed in or near the centre of the fyftem; and that
thefe funs, or other bodies, are the ftars which are' feen in
the heavens.
That fyftem in which our earth is placed, is, by aftr-o
nomers, called the Solar Syftem; and that opinion which
fuppofes the fun to be fixed, in or near the centre, with
feveral bodies revolving round him, at different diftances, is
confirmed by all the obfervations hitheito made.
This opinion is alfo called the Copernican Syftem, from
Nicholas Copernicus, a Polifh philofopher, who, about the
year I473, revived this notion from the oblivion it had been
buried in for many ages.
The fun, therefore, is placed in the midft of an immenfe
fpace, wherein fix opaque fpherical bodies revolve about him
as their centre.
Thefe wandering globes are called the planets, which, at
different diftances, and in different periods, perform their re.volutions, from weft to eaft, in the following order,-i. Mercury is neareft to the fun o`all-ithe planets, and
performs its courfe in about three months, or 87 days 23hours.  II. Venus, in about feven months and a half,' or
z24 days 17 hours.    III. The Earth, in a year,' or 365
days 6 hours.    IV. Mars, in about two years, or 686
days 23 hours.     V, Jupiter, in twelveyears, or 4232
days 12 hours.   VI. and laftly, Saturn, whofe orbit ~
includes all the reft, fpends almoft thirty years, that,ig
10759 days 8 hours, in one revolntion round the fun. T'he
diftances of the plainets from the fun are nearly in th-e following proportion, viz. fuippofing the dirtance of the earth
from the fun to be divided into icoo equal parts; that of
Mercury will be about 387 of thofe parts; of V.' enus 724;
of Mars I 524; of Jupiter 5201; and that of Saturn 9538.
The orbits of the planets are not all in the fame plane,
@ By the orbit of a planet is commonly Underftood, the traAe or
ting defcribed from its centre round the fun; but, by the plane of the
orbit is meant-a flat furface, extended every way through the orbit

but varioufly inclified to one another; fo that, fuppofing the
orbit of the earth to be the fRandard, the others will have
one half above, and the other half below it; interfe&amp;Cting
one another in a line paffing thirough the fun.
The plane of the earth's orbit is called the ecliptic; and
this the aftronomers make the ftandard, to which the planes
of the other orbits a're judged to incline.
The right line paffing through the fun, and the common
interfeAion of the plane of the orbit of any planet with the
ecliptic, is called the line of the nodes of that planet; and
the points themfelves, wherein the orbit cuts the ecliptic,
are called the nodes.
The inclinations of the orbits of the planets, to the
plane of the ecliptic, are as follows, viz. the orbit of Mercury makes an angle of 6~ 52'; that of Venus 30 z2;
of Mars I~ 52'; of Jupiter    ~ 2o0'; and of Saturn 2~
do'.  The orbits of the planets are not circles, but ellipfes
or ovals.
What an ellipfis is, may be eafily underftood from the
following defcription.  Imagine two fmall pegs fixed upright on any plane, and fuppofe them tied with the ends'of a thread, fomewhat longer than their difrance from one
another: now, -if a pin be placed in the double of the
thread, and turned quite round   (always ftretching -the
thread with the fame force) the curve defcribed by the
motion will be an ellipfis.  The two points where the pegs
tfood (about which the thread was turned) are called the
focufes or foci of that ellipfis; and if, without changing
the length of the thread, as we alter the pofition of the
pegs, we fhall then have an ellipfis of a different kind from
the former; and the nearer the focufes are together, the
nearer will the curve defcribed be to a circle; until at laft
the two focufes coincide, and then the pin in the doubling,of the thread will defcribe a perfedct circle.
The orbits of all the planets have the fun in one of their
focufes, and half the diftance between the foctfes is called
the excentricity of the orbits.  This excentricity is differe.nt
in all the planets, but, in molt of them, it is fo fmall, that in
little fchemes or inftruments, made to reprefent the planetary
o1'Jits, it need not be'confidered.
If, as before, we fuppofe the mean diflance of the earthroung Man'9s Be.l Companion.            399
from the fun to be divided into Iooo -equal parts; then
will the excentricity of Mercury be 8i of thofe parts;
that of Venus 5; that of the Earth 17; that of Mars
I41; that of Jupiter 240; and that of Saturn 5-43 of the
fame parts.
The fix planets above-mentioiled, are called primaries,
or primary planets; but befides thefe, there are ten other
leffer planets; which are called fecondaries, moons, or fatellites.  Thefe moons always accompany their refpedive
primaries, and perform their revolutions round them, whilft
both together are alfo carried round the fuin.
Of the fix primary planets, there are but three, as far as
obfervation can affure us, that have thefe attendants, viz.
the Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn,
The Earth is attended by the moon, who performs her
revolution in about 291 days, at the diflance of about 30
diameters of the earth from it; and once a-year is carried
round the futn along with the Earth.
Jupiter has four moons or fatellites; the firft or innermoll
performs its revolution in about I day and 181 hours, at
the diftance of ~3 femidiametefs of Jupiter from his centre; the fecond revolves about Jupiter in 3 days and 13
hours, at the dirtance of 9 of his femidiameters; and the
third in 7 days and 4 hours, at the diftance of I43 femidiameters; the fourth and outermoft performs its courfe in
the fpaee of I6 days I8 hours, and its diflance from  Jupiter's center is z5- of his femidiameters.
Satilrn has no lefs than five Satellites; the firit or innermoft revolves about him in I day and 21 hours, at the diftance of 43 diameters of Saturn, from  his centre; the
fecond completes his period in 23 days, at the diftance of
5'r diameters; the third, in about 41 days, at the diftance
of 8 diameters; the fourth performs its courfe in about I 6
days, at the diftance of I8 diameters; the fifth, and outermoft, takes 793 days to finifh his cotrfe, and is 54 diameters of Saturn diftant from his centre  -The fatellites.
as well as the primaries, perform their revolutions from
weft to eaft; the planes of the orbits of the fatellites of
the fame planet, are variouny inclined to one another, and,
confequently, are inclined to the plane of the orbit of the"
pnmary.

Beifides thefe attendants, Saturn is encompaffed with a
thin ring that does no where touch his body: the diameter of this ring is to the diameter of Saturn, as g to 4; and
the void fpace between the ring and the body of Saturn,
is equal to the breadth of the ring itfelf; fo that, in fome
fituations, the heavens may be feen between the ring and his
body.
This ifurprifing pha~nomenon of Saturn's ring is a modern difcovery; neither were the fatellites of Jupiter and
Saturn known to the ancients; the jovial planets' were firit
difcovered by the famous Italian philofopher, Galileo, by
a telefcope, which he firit invented: and the celebrated
Caffini, the French king's aftronomer, was the firft that faw
all the fatellites of Saturn; which by reafon,of their great
diftances from the fun, and the fi-nallnefs of their own bodies,- cannot be feen by us, but by the help of very good
glaffes.
The motion of the primary planets round the fun (as
alfo of the fatellites round their refpeative primaries) is
called their annual motion; becaufe they have one year;
or the alterations of the feafons, complete in one of thofe
revolutions.  Befides this annual motion, four of the plalets, viz.. Venus, the Earth, Mars, and Jupiter, revolve.
about their own axis, from weft to eat; and this is called.
their diurnal motion.  For, -by this rotationI, each point of
their flirface is carried fucceffively towards, or from the ftulu
who always illuminates the hemifphere that is next to him,
the other remaining obfcure; and while any place is in the
hemifpher illuminated by the fuln, it is day; but, when it
is carried to the obfcure hemifphere, it becomes night; and
to continues, until, by this rotation, the faid place is again
enlightened by the fun.
The Earth performs its revolution round its axis in 23
hours 56. minutes; Venus in 23 hours; Mars in about 24
hours and 40 minutes-; and Jupiter moves round his own
axis in g9 hours and 56 minutes.
Thie fun is alfo fouind to turn round his axis from  welt
to eaft in 27 days; and the moon, which is nearer to us.
than any of the planets, revolves about her axis in a
mo0nth, or in the fpace of time that.he turns round the.;;;~~~~~~~~  rou ng Man's Be? Companion             351
earth: fo that the lunarians have but one day throughout
their year.
The planets are all opaque bodies, having no light but
what they borrow from  the fun: for that fide of them
which is next towards the fun, has always been obferved
to be illuminated, in what pofition foever they be; but
the oppofite fide, which the folar rays do not reach, remains dark and obfcure; whence it is evident, that they
have no light but what proceeds from the fun; for, if
they had all parts of them would be lucid, without any
darknefs or thadow. The planets are likewife proved to
be globular, becaufe, let what part foever of them  be
turned toward the fun, its boundary, or the line feparating that part from the oppofite, always appears. to be
circular; which could not happen, if they were Inot globular.
The Earth is placed betw.ixt the orbs of Mars and Venus;
and Mercury, yenus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, do all turk
round.the fun; both which may be proved from obferva,
tions, as follows.
1. Whenever Venus is in conjunf&amp;ion with the fun, that
is, when the is in the fame dire&amp;ion from the earth, or
towards the fame part of the heavens the fun is in; fhe
either appears with a bright and round face, like a full
moon, or elfe difappears; oir, if file is vifible, the appears
horned, like a new moon: which phenomena could never
happen, if Venus did not turn round the fun, and was not
betwixt him and the earth; for, fince all the planets borrow their light from the fun, it is neceffary that Venus'
lucid face fhould be towards the fun; and, when fhe appears fully illuminated, ihe fhews the fame face to the fun
and the earth;'whence, at that time, the muf be above or
beyond the fun, for, in npo other pofition could her illuminated face be wholly feen from the earth.  Farther, when
fhe difappears; or,  if vifible, appears horned; that face of
hers, which is towards the fun, is either wholly turned from
the earth, or only a finall part of it can be feen by the earth p.;nd, in this cafe, the muf, of neceflity, be betwixt us and
the fun.
Befides the foregoing, there is another argument to,
kroye, that Venus turns round the fun, in an orbit that i.
X4;$3 Tr Young Man's Bed Companionm
within the earth's; becaufe {he is always obferved to keep
near the fun, and in the fame quarter of the heavens that
he is in, never receding from him more than about - of a
whole circle, and, therefore, he can never come in oppofition
to him; which would neceffal-ily happetn, did fle perform
her courfe round the earth either in a longer or fhorter time
than a year.
And this is the reafon,' why Venus is never to be feen
near midnight, but always either in the morning or evening, and, at mofi, not above three or four hours before
fun'-ifing or after fun fetting.  From' the time of Venus'
fuperior conjun&amp;ion (or when fle is above the fun) fhe is
more eafterly than the fun, and, thecrefore, fets later, and
is feen after-fun fetting, and then is commonly called the
Evening litar:  but, from the time of her inferior conjunecion, till (he comes again to the fulperior, {he then appears rhore wefterly than the fun, and is only to be feen
in the morning before fun rifing, and is then called the
Morning ftar.
After the fame manner we prove, that Mercury turnq
round the fun, fort he, always keeps in t'le fun's neighbourhood, and never recedes from him fo far as Venus does;
and, therefore, the orbit of Mercury lies within that of Venus; and, on accoiunt of his nearnefs to the fun, he can fel
dom be feen without a telefcope.
Mars is obferved to come in oppofition, and, likewife5
to have all other afpeds with the fun; he always preferves
a round, full, and bright face, except when he is near his
quadrate afpea&amp;  when he appears fomewhat gibbous, like
the -moon three or four days before or' after the full.
therefore, the orbit of Mars mufl include the earth within
it, and alfo the fun; for, if he was betwixt the fun and us,
at the time of his inferior conjun&amp;cion, he would either quite
difappear, or appear horned, as Venus, and the moon, dq
-in that pofition.
Mars, when he is in oppofition to the fun, looks almoft
feven times larger in diameter, than when be is in conjuncl
tion with him; and, therefore, muft needs'be almoft feven
times nearer to us, in one pofition, than in the other:
for the apparent magnitudes of far diftant objedts in&amp;reafe, or decreafe, in proportion to their diftances from.roung Man's Be     Companion.           31  
as; but Mars keeps always, nearly, at the fame -diftance
from the fun; therefore it is plain, that it is not the earth,
but the fun, that is the centre of his motion,
It js proved, in the fame way, that Jupiter and Saturn
have both the fun and earth within their orbits; and that
the fun, and not the earth, is the centre of their motions;
although the difproportion of the diflances from the earth is
pot fo great in Jupiter as in Mars, nor fo great in Saturn
as it is in Jupiter, by reafon thgt they are at a mnuch greater
diitance from the fun.
We have now fhewn, that all the-planets turn round the
fun, and that Mercury and Venus are included between
him  and the earth; whenc;e they are called the inferior
planets; and that the earth is placed between the orbits
of Mars and Venus, and,. there(ore, included within the
orbits of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; whence they arc
palled the fuperior planets: and fince the earth is in the
middle of thefe moveable bodies, and is of the' fame nature with them', we may conclude, that {he has the fame
fort of motions; but that fhe turns round the fun is proved
thus:
All the planets feen from the earth appear to move very
unequally; as fometimes to go falter, at other times flower,;mnd fometimes to be itationary, or not to move at all; which
could not happen if the earth ffood i.fil,
The annual periods of the planets round the fun are determined, by carefully obferving the length of time, fince their
departure from a certain point in the heavens (or from a
fixed ftar) until they arrive to the fame again.  By thefe
forts of obfervations, the ancients determined the periodical
revolutions of the planets round the fun; and were fo exaf&amp;
in their computations, as to be capable of predi&amp;ing eclipfes,
9f the fun and moon; but, tince the invention of telefcopes,
aftronomical obfervations are made with greater accuracy,
and, of confequence, 9ur tables are far mnore perfet than
thofe of the ancients.
And, in order to be as exa&amp;t as poffible, aftronomers
compare obfervations made at a -great. diftance of time
from  one another, including feverial peiiods; by which

difls- (or the edge of their furfaces)' and feem, by degrees,
to creep towards their middle; and fo on, going ftill
forward, till they come to the oppofite fide or edge
of the diflc, where they fet or difappear; and after they
have been hid for the fame fpace of time that they were
vifible, they again appear to-rife, in or near the fame'place,
as they did at'firfl; then to creep on progreflively, tak,

tioned.
It is very probable that Mercury and Saturn have likeT
wife a motion round their axis, that all the parts of theig
furface may alternately enjoy the light and heat of the fun,
and receive fuch changes as are proper and convenient foitheir nature; but, by reafon of the nearnefs -of Mercury
to the Sun, and Saturn's immenfe diffance from him, no.
obfervations have hitherto been made, whereby their fpots.
(if they have any) could be difcovered, and, therefore,
their diurnal motions cannot be determined. The diurnal
motion of the earth is concluded to eifit from the appa:
rent revolution of the heavens, and of all the ftars round
it, in the fpace of a natural day,  For, it is much eafiet.
to conceive that this, comparatively fmall, globe fhould
turn round its own axis, once in 24 hours, than that fuch
a great number of much larger bodies, fomc of them  fo
immenfely diftant, fhould revolve round it in fo fihort a,
fpace of time.  The folar fpots do not always remain the
fame, but, fometimes, old ones vanifh, and, afterwards,
others fucceed in their room; fometimes, feveral fmall onea
gather together, and make one large fpot, and, fometimes,
a large fpot is feen to be divided into many fmoll ones. But,
notwithifanding thefe changes, they all turn round with the,
fun in the fame time.

and it alfo appears, that every one has a trad peculiar to
itfelf; whereby the paths of the fix planets form, among
the ftars, a kind of road, which is called the zodiac; the
middle path whereof, called -the ecliptic, is the orbit defcribed by the earth, with which the orbits of the other pla.
nets are-compared.
As the ecliptic runs through twelve conftellations, it is
fuppofed tobe divided into twelve equal parts, of 30 degrees
each, called figns, having the fate names with the twelve
conltellations they run through.
The plane of'the ecliptic is fuppofed to divide the ce.
leflial fphere into two equal parts, called the Northern
and Southern Hemifphere; and a body fituated on either of thefe hemifpheres is faid to have north or fouth
latitude, according to the hemifphere it is in: fo that the
latitude of a celeftial objeI is its neareft difiance from the
ecliptic,
The planes of the other five orbits are obferved to lie
partly in the northern, and partly in the fouthern hemifphere; fo that every one cuts the ecliptic in two oppofite
points called Nodes; one called the afcending node, is that
through which the planet paffes, when it moves out of the
fouthern into the northern hemifphere; and the other, called the defcending node, is that through which the planet
mutt pafs, in going out of the northern into the fouthern
hemifphere.
The right line joining the two nodes of any planet, is
called the line of the nodes.
The names to molt of the conftellations were given by
the.ancient aftronomers who reckoned that fiar in Aries,
now marked, r (according to Bayer) to be the firif point
in the ecliptic, this ftar being next the fun'when he enter.

from the'equinox; which diffErence is called the Preceffion of the equinoxes, whereof the yearly alteration is
about 50 feconds of a degree, or about a degree in 72
years.
All the planets have one cotnlmon focus, in which the fun
is placed: for, as no other fuppofition can folve all the appearances that are obferved in the motion of the planets,
and as it alfo agrees with the ftrideflt phyfical and mathematical reafoning; therefore, it is now received as an elementary
principle.
The line of tlle nodes of every planet paffes through the
fun; for,. as the motion of every planet is in a plane paffing
through the fun, confequently, the interfedtions of thefe
planes, that is, the lines of the nodes, muft alfo pafs through
the fun.
All the planets in their revolutions are fometimes nearer,
fometimes farther from the fun: this is a confequence of
the fun not being placed in the centre of each orbit, the,orbits being ellipfis.
The aphelian, or filperior apfis, is that point of the
orbit which is fartheft diftant from the fun: and the' perihelion,, or inferior apfis, is that point which is neareft
the fun: and the tranfverfe diameter of the orbit, or the
line joining the two apfis, is called the line of the apfis or
apfides.'-The planets move failer as they approach the fun, or come
rearer to the perihelion, and flower as they recede from the
fun, or come n.earer the aphelion: this is not only a confequence from the nature of the planets' motions about the
fun, but is confirmed by all good obfervations.
If a right line be drawn from the fun, through any planet
(which:line is called by fome the veetor iadius) and be fup.,pofed to revolve round the fun with the planet, then this line,will defcribe, or pafs through every part of the plane of the
orbit, fo that the vedor'radi:us may be faid to defcribe the,yrea of the orbit.
There are two chief laws obferved in the folar fyftem,
which regulate the motion of-all the planets; namely,

equal'areas or portions of the fpace contained within the
planet's orbitII. The fquares of the periodical times of the planets are
as the cubes of the mean ditlances from the fun: that is, as,
the fquare of the time which a planet, A, takes to revolve'in its orbit, is to the fquare of the time taken by any other
planet, B, to run through its orbit; fo is the cube of the
mean dittance of A from the fun, to the cube of the mean
diflance of B from the fun.
The mean diftance of a planfet from the fun is its diftance
from him, when a planet is at either extremity of the conjugate diameter; and is equal to half of the tranrfverfe
diameter.
The foregoing laws are the two famous laws of Kepler, a great aftronomner, who flourifhed in Germany about
the beginning of the 17th century, and who deduced
them  from a multitude of obfervations; but the firft who
demoniftrated thefe laws, was the incomparable Sir Ifaac
Newton.
By the fecond law, the relative diflances of the planets
from the fun are known; and, was the real diftance of any
one known, the abfolute diftances of all the others would
thereby be obtained.
Befide the planets already mentioned, there are other
great bodies that, fometimes, vifit our fyftem, which are a
fort of temporary planets; for, they come and abide with us
for a while, and afterwards withdraw from us, for a certain
fpace of time, after which they againI return.  Thefe wandering bodies are called cornets.
The motion of the comets in the heavens, according to
the beft obfervations hitherto made, feems to be regulated
by the fame immutable law with the planets: for their orbits
are elliptical, like thofe of the planets, but vaftly narrower
or more excentric.  Yet, they have not all the fame direction with the planets, who move from weft to eait, for fome
of the comets move from eaft to weft; and their orbits have
different inclinations to the earth's orbit; fome inclining
northwardly, others fouthwardly, much more than any of
the planetary orbits do.
Although both the cometp and the planets move in ellip.
tic orbits, yet their motions feem to be vaftly different:14~ 2!:-%Tuoungo Man's.Bej Compandii.

for, the etxcentricities of the planets' orbits are fo fmal,
that they differ but little from circles; but, the excentricities of the comets are fo very greet, that the motions of fomeof them feem to be almoft in right lines, tending diretly
towards the fun.
Now, fince the drbit8 of the comets'ae fo extremely excentric, thei rnotions when they are in their perihelia, or
neareft dittance from the fun, muft be much fwifter, thanr
when they are in their aphelia, or fartheft diRance from
himl; which is the reafon why the comets make fo fhort a
itay in our fyLiem; and, when they difappear, are fo long in
returning.
The figures of the comets are obferved to be very different; fome of them fend foith fmall beams, like hair, every way round them: others are feen with a long fiery
tale, which is always oppofite to the fun.  Their magnitudes are alfo very different; but, in what proportion they
exceed each other, is, as yet, uncertain.  Nor is it probable that their numbers are yet known, for, they have
not been obferved with due care, nor their. theories difcovered, but of late years.; The ancients were divided in
their opinions concerning them; fome imagined that they
were only a kind of meteors, kindled in our atmofphere,
and were there again diffipated; others took them to be
fome ominous prodigies.   But modern difeoveries prove
that they are worlds, fubje&amp; to the fame laws of motion as
the planets are; and they muft be very hard and durable
bodies, elfe they could not bear the vail heat, which fome
of them, when in their perihelia, receive firom the fun,
~without being utterly confumed. The great comet which
appeared in the year I68o, was within I, part of the fun's
diameter fro'., his fuirface; and, therefore, its heat muft
be prodigioufly intenfe beyond imagination: and, when it
is at its greateit diftanceifrom the fun, the cold muft be as.
rigid.
The fixed ftairs are.thofe bright and Ihining bodies.
which, in a clear night, appear to us every where difperfed
through the boundlefs regions of fpace. They are termed
fixed, becaufe they are found to keep the fame immuta-.
ble diftance in all ages, without having the motions obferved in the planets.  The fixed Rtars are all placed atToung Man's Bedrt Com panon.         3
fuch immenfe diftances from us, that the befL of telefcopes
reprefent them no bigger than points, without having any
apparent diameters.
It is evident from hence, that all the liars are luminous
bodies, anid fhine with their own proper and native light,
elfe they could not be feen at fuch a great ditiance.  For
the fatellites of Jupiter and Saturn, though they appear'under confiderable- angles through good telefcopes, yet are
altogether invifible to the naked eye.
Although the diilance betwixt, us and the fun is vaftly
large, when compared to ihe~ diameter of the earth, yet,
it is nothing when compared with the prodigious diftance
of the fixed fliars; for, the whole diameter of the earth's
annual orbit, appears from  the n'eareft fixed ftar no bigger than a point, and the fixed ftars are, at. leaft, Ioo,ooo
times farther from us than we are from the fun; as may be
demonftrated from the obfervations of thofe who have endeavoured to find the parallax of the earth's annual orbit,
or the angle under which the earth's orbit appears from the
fixed ftars.
Hence is follows, that though we approach nearer to
fome fixed ltars a,t one time of the year than we do at the
oppofite, and that by the whole length of the diameter of
the earth's orbit; yet this diftance, being fo fmall in comparifon with -the diflance -of the fixed i ars, their magnitudes or pofitions cannot thereby be fenfibly altered.
Therefore, we may always, without error, fuppofe ourfelves to be in the fame centre of the heavens, Iince we
have always the fame vifible profpeca of the flars without
any alteration.
If a fpe&amp;ator was placed as near to any fixed fliar, as
we are to the ftun, he would there obferve a body as big,
and every way like as the fun appears to us; and our fiuna
would appear to him  no bigger than a fixed ftliar; and,
undoubtedly, he would reckon the fuin as one of them, in
xlumbering the ftars. Wherefore, fince the fun differeth in
nothing from a fixed liar, the, fixed itars may be reckoned
as fo m;any funs.
It is not reafonable to fuppofe, that all the fixed ifars
are placed at the fame difiance from us; but it is more
probable-that they are- every where interfperfed, throuagh3oung iVan's BeJl Conzpaniont
the vafi indefinite fpace of the univerfe; and that there may
be as great a ditlance between any two of them, as there is
betwixt our fun- and the neareft fixed flar. Hence it fbllows
why they appear to us of different magnitudes, not becaufe
they really are fo, but becaufe they are at different diftances
from us; thofe that are neareft excelling in brightnefs and
lufLre thofe that are more remote, which give a fainter light,
and appear fmaller to the eye.
The aflronomers difiribute the itars into feveral orders,
or claffes: thofe that are neareift to us, and appear bright-.
eft to the eye, are called lfars of the firft magnitiude; thofe
that are neareft to them  in brightnefs and luftre, are called liars of the fecond magnitude; thofe of the third clafs,
are flyled fiars of the third magnitude; and fo on, until
we come to fiars of the fixth magnitude, which are the
fmalleft that can be difcerned by the naked eye.   There
are infinite numbers of finaller ftars, that can be feen
through telefcopes; but thefe are not reduced to any of
the fix orders, and are only called telefcopic liars.  It
may be here obferved, that though the aftronomners have
reduced all the ftars that are vifible to the naked eye, into
fome one or other of thefe claffes; yet we are not to coni
clude from thence, that all thefe ifars anfwer exadtly to
fome or other of thefe orders; but there may be in reality
as many orders of the ftars as they are in number, few of
them appearing of the fame bignefs and luftre.
The ancient aftronomers, that they might diftinguifh the
ftars, in regard to their fituation and pofition to eacth other,,
divided the whole ftarry firmament into feveral afterifms, or
fyftems, of ftars, confifting' of thofe that are near to one
another.  Thefe afterifms are called Conftellations,. and are
digefted into tile forms of fome animals, as men, lions, bears,
ferpents, &amp;c. or, to the images of fome known things, as of
a crow, a harp, a triangle, &amp;c.
The Ptarry firmament was divided by the ancients into
48 images or coniiellations; twelve of which they placed;
in that part of the heavens wherein are the planes of the
planetary orbits; which part is called the zodiac, becaufe
moft of the conftellations placed' therein, refemble fome

The ancients placed thefe particular confl-ellations or fi*
gures'in the heavens, either to commemorate the deeds of
fome great man, or of fome notable exploit or a&amp;fion, or elfe
took them from the fables of their religion, &amp;c. And the
modern aftronomers do ftill retain them, to avoid the confuflion that would arife by making new ones, when they compare, the modern obfervations with the old onles.

Some of the principal alirs have particular names given
to them, as Syrius, Ar&amp;lurus, &amp;c.  There are alfo feveral
ftars.that ate not redutced into colifellations, and thefe are
called unformed ftars.
BPefides the flars vifible to the naked eye, there is a very
remarkable fpace in tile heavens called the Galaxy, or Milky
WVay; this is a broad circle of a whitifh hue like milk, going quite round the whole, heavens; and ctonfitting of an
infinite number of finall flars, vifibie through a telefcope,
though not difcernab!e by the naked eye, by reafon of their
exceeding faintnefs; yt t with their light, they combine to
illuftrate-that part of the heavens where they are, and to
caufe that fhining whitenefs.
The places of the fixed liars, or their relative fituations
one from another, have been carefully obfcrved by aftronomers, and digefled into catalogues.  The firit among
the Greeks, who reduced the Rfars into a catalogue, was
Hipparcus, who, fron his own. obfervations, and of thofe
who lived before him, inferted 1022 ftar:s into his catalogue,
about Izo years before the Chriftian ara; this catalogue
has been fince enlarged and improved, by feveral learned
men, to the number of 3000, of which there are a great
many telefcopical, and not to be difcerned by the naked
eye; and thefe are all ranked in the catalogue as ftars of the
feventh magnitude.
It may feem ftrange to fome, that there are no'more than
this number of fRars vifible to the naked eye; for, fometimes, in a clear night, they feem to be innumerable.  But
this is only a deception of our fight, arifing from their vehement fparkling, while we look upon them confufedly, without reducing them into any order; for there can feldom  be
-feen above Iooo ftars in the whole heavens, with the naked
eye, at the fame time: aid,. if we would ditlinfly view
them, we fhall not find many but what are inferted upon a
good- celeftial globe.
Althotgh the number of liars that can be difcerned by
the naked. eye are fo few, yet, it is probable, there are
maiy'more, which are beyond the reach of oulr optics;
for, through telefcopes, they appear in vaIt rmhltitudes,
every where difperfed, throughout: the whole heavens; and
the better our glaffes are, the more we l~ill difcover. Theroung Man's BeB    Contpnion. no
Tige nious Dr. Hooke has obferved 78 ltars in the Pleiadesi
of which the naked eye is never able to difcern above 7; andl
in Orion, which has but 8. fiars in the Britifli catalogue
(and folne of them telefkopical) there have been numbered

Tlofe w-ho think that all thefe glorious bodies were created -for no other purpofe, than to give us a little dim light,
muft entertain a very flender idea of the divine Wifdom,
for, we receive more light from the moon itfelf, than from
all the fl'ars put together.
And, iince:the planets are fubjed&amp; to the fame laws of
motion with our- earth, and fome of tklem- not only equal
to,, but vaflly --exceed it in magnitude, it is not. unreafonable to fuppofe, that they are all habitable' worlds.  And,.fince the fixed ltars are nowife behind our f un, either in bignefs or' lutre; is it not, probablej that each of, them have a

Of Upright Planes.
Thofe planes are faid to be eret or upright which ftand
perpendicular to the horizon of the place, whofe upper
part pointeth to the zenith, and their lower to the nadir;
and fuch are the walls of houfes, churches, fteeples, &amp;c.
againft which dials are commonly made.
How to draw the hour lines on a dire&amp; fouth plane, in
the lat. of 5 1 deg. 32 min. is defcribed by the following
reprefentation.
Firft, draw the circle Z E W N, reprefenting an upright
dirted fouth plane; next crofs it with the diameters Z QN
for the meridian or Iz o'clock Jine; and W  Q_ E for the
prime vertical circle, oi: hour-line of fix.
Secondly, out of your line of chords, take- 38 degrees
28 minutes (the complement of the latitude of the place)
and fet that diitance on the dial plane from Z to a, and E.
to b, and from N to e.
Thirdly, lay a ruler from W to a, and it will cut the
meridian Z N in the point Pa the pol,of the world: androung Man's BeJt eCompanio.n.
a ruler alfo laid from W-to b will cut tlhe meridian -in.AE,
which is the point through which the equino&amp;ial muft pafs;
for the drawing of which, you have th-ree points given, -Viz.
E, iE, W, and the centre will always be in the meridian
line.Z N.
Fourthly, divide the femicircle E N W  into 12 equal'
parts, as the points O O 0, &amp;c.
Fifthly, lay a ruler to Q_and each of thefe pQints O 0 0,
and the ruler will crofs the equinodical circle in the points
&amp;c. dividing that into 12 unequal parts.
Sixthly, lay a ruler to P (the pole of tle world) and
every one of the marks -~:  &amp;c. anid the ruler will crofs
the circle of the plane inithe points    C j J &amp;c.
Laftly, if through the cerntre Q  and the refipeEtive points
i   f ] &amp;c. you draw right lines, they will be true hour
lines of an ere&amp; foiUth plane.
For the gnomon or-ftile, take 38 deg. 28 min. out of
the line of chords, and fet them from N to e, drawing the
line Q_e for the axis of the ftile, which mufc hang diredly
over the meridian or hour line of I2, and point downwards
to the fouth-pole, becaufe the plane beholds the fouth part
of the meridian.
In making th'is dial, you make two dials: for the ere&amp;t
dire&amp; north dial is but the backfide of the fouth;v. for, as
this beholdeth the fouth part of the meridian, fo the other
faceth- the north part of the meridian; and, as the meridian
line in the fouth dial fhews when it is Iz o'clock at noon,
fo the backfide thereof, viz. the north fide, reprefents the
hour-line of i 2 o'clock at midnight, and, therefore, not
expreffed, nor the hour-lines of 9, Io) l, at night, or of i,
2, 3, in the morning, the fun being never feen by us above
the horizon at thofe hours: fo that thl north dial is capable
of only receiving the hours of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 in the morn-L
ing, and4, 5, 6, 7   l, and 8 at night, and (in this latitude)
not all of them neither; for, it flhines not in this plane, at
-eight in the morning, nnorat 4 in the afternoon, but, it is
beft to put themi down, as in the figure following, to know
how- much it is paft 8 in the morning, a,nd what it wants of
5 in the afternoon,33.o          roung Man's -Befl Companion.

An EaJi diret Dial, in Lat. 5 I deg. 32 min.roung Man':s SBej/ Companion; 3.3.:
Let A B C D be ttie dial plane on which is to be drawn
a dire&amp;t eafL dial: upon the point D, if an eait dial, and on
the point C, if a welt, with th;e radius (or chord of 6o degrees) defcribe the obfcure arc E F; then, from your chords,
take 38 deg. 28 min. the complement of the latitude of the
place; and fet them from E to F, and draw the line D F,
quite through the plane, then that you may proportion tlie
flile to the pane, fo that you may bring on all the hours
from fuin-rifing to I I o'clock, affume two points in the line
F D, one towards the end D (as the point G) for the hourline of It, and another at H, for the hour-line of 6; and
through the points G and H, draw the lines i Gj i, and
6 H 6; on the point G, with the chord of 60o degrees, defcribe the obfcure arc I IK; and taking IS degrees from the
fcale of chords, in the compaffes, fet one foot in- I, and,
with the other cut the arc I K in K; through:G and K,
draw the line G K L, cutting the line 6 H 6 in the point
L; fo {hall L I-I be the height of the perpendicular fcile
propbrtioned to this plane.
For the drawing of the hour-line, fet one foot of the
compaffes (opened to 6o degrees of the chords) in L, and,
with the other, defcribe the arc M  N,' between the hdurline of 6, and the line G I,; which divide into five equal
parts in the points o oo o o, and a ruler laid fromn the
point L, to each of thefe points o o o, &amp;c. will cut the
equinodial line H -D in the points " X ~': ~; through
which points draw lines parallel to 6 H  6, as the line's
7 * 7, 8  8, &amp;c. as may be feen in the figure.
And'thus you have made two dials, viz. a weftldial as
well as 1an eaft; only,the arc E F, through which-the equinotial paffeth in the eafl dial, is drawn on the right-hand
of the plane; but, in the wefll, it muIt be drawn on the left;
and the hour-lines 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, Id, and i i, in the fore-,
poon, on the eaft dial, muff be 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and I iiia

The ftile of the eaft or welt dials, may be either a ftrait
pin of the juft length of the line H O in the other figure,
which is equal to H L fixed in the point H, on the hourline of 6, and exal&amp;y pelpendicular to the plane, fhewing
the hours by the ihadow of the apex, or very near the top
thereof: or, it may be a plate of brafs of the fame breadth
with the dirtance of the hour-lines of 6 and 3; which plate
mutc be fet perpendicular upon the hourline of 6, and fo
it will fhew the hour by the fhadow of the -upper edge
thereof, as in the laft figure.
Of beautLfying and colouring Dials.
Firft, the boards are to be brufhed over with lintfeed oil,
thinly ground with Spanifh brown, done over three or four
times: (drying between each time) a little thicker each time
with the colour; and this is called Primming.
T'o make the Fat Oil for Dials.
Boil red lead and lintfeed oil, and a little litherage of
gold (about a pennyworth) together, till almoft as thick as
fyrup; and, when cold, and well fettled, pour the cleareft
into a bottle- or bladder for ufe.

To draw Golden Letters or Fig-ures for the Hours.
Firft, draw them with a pencil dipt. in the gold fize before mentioned; which, when fo dry as juit to ftick to
your fingers, then, with a fmooth-edged penknife fhape
-your leaf gold to your mind; take it up with a piece of
cotton cloth fixed to the end of a ftick, and lay it on the
fize, preffing it down with the fame cotton, and, when dry,
brufh off the loofe gold with a feather, and fmooth the
rough edges of the letters with a pencil dipped in red or
blqack colour.
Of the Dial Plane.
Let the board be of the'beft feafoned, firmeft, cleareft
oak, one, two, or more feet fquare, and about three inches
thi.ck. Take two boards, and get them planed on both
fides, and then laid in the fun fhine, or near a moderatefire, -two or three days together; then plane them again,
and fix them with good joints; and faiten them in gluing with wooden pegs, as I have feen coopers fix their
pieces of heading for their caflks; and, -when thus glued
and dried, -plane them again, and then faflen them, by
nailing two fmall plates of iron or tin on the-back.  If
you cannot get feafoned wood-, but green, then boil it
about an hour in water, to make it tough, and keep it
from warping.  In the general, wood is accounted better
than fPone, becaulfe it keeps the colouring more Rfaunch.or
firm.
Before you colour your dial plate or board, fix your iron
ftile of 38 degrees (which indifferently ferves for all England;) and having marked your hour-lines, with ink, and
faflened a nail at the end of each hour-line, that the head
of each-nail may Ihadow or dire&amp; you to the centre when
it is coloured. And as it may happen that golden letters.
or figures may decay in a few:years, you may, on that ac:
count, make them   with white-lead paint, pointed with
red in a black margin. When ydur dial is finifhed, and
4ry, dip.a feather in your oil, and anoint it thinly; for,

the finer you mix or grind the colouring with the oil, the
more beautiful it appears, though not fo lafting.

Froft is to be expea&amp;ed now, and nothing is fo dangerous
to tender flower roots, and their fhoots for fpring.
Ranunculuifes, anemonies, and tulips, will be in danger: cover the beds to guard them, lay on peafe-flraw
where they are not come up; but where the Mhoot appears,
place hoops with mats and cloths upon them. This is the
common pra&amp;dice; but, in that excellent work, The complete body of Gardening, lately publifhed, there is a new
method propofed, and much eafier and better.  This is
to place behind them a reed-hedge, floping three feet forward.   A mat is to be let down from the top in fevere
weather, and taken up in mild.  This certainly preferves
them, and yet does not draw them weak, or make them
tender.
Cover the beds and boxes, of feedling flowers, and take
off the defence when the weather is milder.

Nurfe the cauliflower plants kept under glaffes carefully;
fhut out the froft, but, in the middle of milder days, let in
a little air; pick off dead leaves, and gather up the mould
about the ftocks.
Make' a flight hot-bed in the open ground, for young

or full flop; and thefe do bear to one another a kind of
progreffional proportion of time; for, the comma fignifies
a ftop of leifurelp telling one, the femicolon two, the colon three, and the period four. They are made or marked
thus;
Comma (,) at the foot of a word.
Semicolon (;) a point over the comma.
Colon (:) two points
Period (.) a fingle point at the foot of a word.
Example of the comnma.)  There is not any thing in
the world, perhaps, that is more talked of, and lefs undertfood, than the bufinefs of a happy life.; Example of the femicolon.)  It is not a curfe that
makes way for a bleffing; the bare wifh is an injury; the
moderation of Antigonus was remarkable.: Example of the colon.)  A found mind is not to be
fhaken with popular applaufe: but anger is Rfartled at every
accident.. Example of the-period.)  It is a fhlamtbe, fays Fabius,
for a commander to excufe himfelf, by faying, I was not
aware of it.  A  cruelty that was only fit for Marius to
fuffer, Sylla to command, and Catiline to adt.
By the examples foregoing, we may eafily note, that a
comma is a note of a fhort ifay between ~words in the ifen*tence, and, therefore, the tenor of-the voice muft ftill be
kept up.--The femicolon is a little longer, and the tone
of the voice very- little abated.-The colon fignifies perfea
fenfe, though not an end of the fentence, and the voice a
little abated, or let fall.--The period denotes perfEedt fenfe,
and the end of the fentence.? When a queflion is aftled, there is a crooked mark
made over the period thus? and is called a note of interrogation.  Example, What could be happier than the
Rate of mankind,' when people lived without either avarice
or envy? The time of paufe for this ftop, is the fame with
the femicalon-    -! If a fudden crying out, or wondering be expreffed,
then this mark is made over the full fRop, thus! and called
a note of admiration, or exclamation.  Example, Oh the
aflonifhing wonders-that are in the elemientary world!
() If one fentence be within another, of which it is n.o
C 4- 24. oug'Man's /M.. Cortnpano,.
part,: then it is placed between two femicircles or paren~
6teefes,. made thus ().' Example, Pompey, on: the'other
fide (that hardly ever fpake in ptiblic without a blntfh). had
a wonderful fweetnefs of nature.; Again: Of authors, be
fure to make choice of the beft, and (as I faid before).to
llick clofe to them.'Once-more': -_Honour'thy father and
mnother (which is the firft commandment with promife)
that it may be well. with thee.-In reading a parenthefis,
the- tone muft be fomewhat' lower, as-a thing or matter
that comes in by the bye, breaking' in as it were on the
main-coherence of the period.   The time is equal to a
comma,'and ought to be read pretty quick; left it detain
the ear too:long from the fenfe of the more important matter.  -,' Apoftrophe is a comma at the head of letters, fJgnify-ing fome letter or' letters left out for quicker pronlunciation,'as I'll for I wrill, would'1t for would/e. fbhan't fo-i fhall
not, ne'er for never, is't for is it,'tis for it is, i''th' for
in (the, o'er for over: or to denote a genitive cafe, as my
father's houfe,my uncle's wife,  &amp;c..
A':ccerintis placed over a vowel,:to denote that the ftrefs
or fouind in pronunciation is on that fyllable.:'Brieve,'or a crooked mark over a vowel, fignifies it
muit bg founded fbhort or quick.
^ Caret- fgnifies fomnething is wanting, and is placed;lnderneath the'line, juft whei-e any thing, omitted. by mifo-:take, or forgetfulnefs, &amp;. -fhould be brought in  -'A Circumflex is' of the faame ihape witth the caret, but is
p!aced oier fome:vowel, to fhw' thei fyll'able to:be long, as -
L u-ph ri-tes.
Dialyfis, or Diarefis, or-two points placed over two
vowels, in a word, fignifies' they are to be parted, beingf no
diphlithong.. -
-Hyp'len,'or note of conne&amp;ion,c is a ftraight'line;
-which,.being fet at the enfd of a line, fhew's that the fyllables of that word are parted, and the remainder of it is a t
the beginning of the next line; and fometines is 0fed in
compou'nd words, as burnt-facrifices,"' heart-breaking, fotilhealing, -book-keeper, &amp;c.  N. B. That when you haveC
not,roorn-tb'write thb whole word at the end of a line, hbut
~.re obliged to finifh it at the beginning of the next, f'cli_..oung FMain's Beff Compan. le
-words mut be trully divided, according to the rules of fpelling, as, re-jfrain, not                             reftrain.  When the hyphen is placed over a vowel, it is
properly; a dabh, and fignifies the omiffion of m or.n; it
is much lifed in old -Latin authors, and foeimeties'in
En-glifh, efpecially in law-bufinefs.  Example, It is very
comedabie to write a good hand.
Index, is a note'like a hand, pointing to fbmething
very remarkable.
A Afteri,fk, or flar, dird:cs to foine remark in the margin, or at the foot of the page.. Several of them together
denote fomethirng defecive, or immodeit, in that paffage
of the author.
F'Obelifk, is a mark like a dagger, and refers to the
margin, as the afterifl; and, in didtionaries, it fignifies
the word to be obfolete, or old, and out of ufe.
~ Paragraph, denotes a divifion comprehending feveral'ientences under.one head.
S,Se&amp;ion, fignifies the beginning of a new head of difcoutife, and is ufed in fubdividing a chapter, or book, into
leffer parts or portions.
[] Brackets or Crotchets, generally indude a word or
Sentence explanatory of what went before; or words of the
fame fenfe, which may be ufed in their feead.
"o-.Qj.tation, otr double cornma reverfe, is ufed at the
beginrling of the line, and ihews what is quoted from an
author., to be:his 6wn -words.
IThls much for pointing, {fops, and marks; which, if
carefully heeded and obferved, wVll add grace and credit to
your writing.                         -

Diretions to Beginners in Writing.
FirfR, it is neceffary to be provided with the follow;ng
implements, viz. good pens, good -and free ink, and alfo
good paper, when arrived to- commendable performances;
likewife a flat ruler for furenefs, and a round one for difpatch; with a leaden plummet or pencil to-rule the lines;
alfo, gum-fandriack ]powder (or pounce as they call it)
with a little cotton dipped therein, which rub gently over
the paper, to make it bear the ink the better; particularly,
when full ha'nds are to be written, fuch as text, &amp;c. and,
efpeciallv, when you are obliged to fcratch out a word or
letter; for then there will be a neceffity for its ufe; and,
rubbincr the place with the pounce, fmooth it with the haft
of the penknife, pr clean paper, and then you may write
what is proper in the fame place. Thefe implements are
fummed up in thefe lines;
A penknife, razor metal, quills good ftore;
Gum-fandriack powder, to pounce paper o'er;
-   Ink fhining black; paper more white than fnow;
Round anld flat rulers on yourfelf bellow::With willing mind, thefe, and induftrious hand,

of width mufl be obferved in the u, w, and o.  The letters with hlems or heads, muff be of equal height, as the
b, d, f - h, k, 1, and f.  And thofe with tails mull be
of equal depth, as the f, g, p, q, and f.  The capitals
mull bear the fame proportion one to another, with reifpec
to bignefs and height, as, A, B, C, ]D, E, F, G, H, I,
&amp;c. -This proportion of letters, both fmall and-great,
mullft be obferved in, and will ferve for, all hands whatfo~
ever.  N. B. That all upright rfrokes, anld thofe leaning
to the left hand, mufl be firie or hair firokesl; and all
downright tirokes mufl be fuller or blacker.  And, when
you are in joining, where letters will naturally join, without any ifraining, take not off the pen in writing, efpecially in running or mixed hands.  Care likewife mull be
duly taken, that there be an equal diftance between letter
and letter, and alfo between word and word: the dillance
between word and word may be the fpace that the fmall m
takes up: but between letter and letter not quite fo much.
Sit not long at'writing, (that is, no longer than you improve,)- efpecially at the firft, left it weary you, and you
grow tired of learning.  Imitate the belt examples, and
have a conflant eye at your copy; and be not ambitious of
writing fa-t; before you can write well; expedition will
naturally follow, after you have gained a habit of writing
fair and free; and it is much lmore commendable to -be an
hour in writing fix lines well, than to be able to write fixty
lines in the faime ti-me, whicli Wperhaps will be altogether
unintelligible.  And beftides, by a flow and fair procedure,
you will learn in half'thee time; and, therefore, it is a vain
thought in a learner, to deflre to be qtick before he hath
acquired experience, and a freedom of writing, by frequent
pradice.  If you have cotton in youlr in,k, look well that
there be no hairs at the nib of your pen. Never overcharge
your pen with: ink, but llale what is too much into the
ink-ifand again.Toung XV~an's Bej Conmpanion.

that caufes a roughnefs and fpoils it; but if you do, to

Or, you may diffolve half an ounce of gum Senega, or

of vermilion into a fmall gallipot, and pour fome of the
gum-water to it, and atir it well, and mix it together with
a hair-pencil, to a proper confiftency; but it will not incorporate prefently; but by the next day it will; then having a clean pen, dip it into the ink, having firit well ftirred it with the pencil, and then you may ufe it: it is a fine

after the fame manner, you may make any other coloured,
ink, as, blue, green, yellow, purple, &amp;c. having divers
gallipots for that ufe.  In like manner, you may mix the
fhell-gold, for curious occafions, pouring two or three

if once it doth, it will be good for nothing, for it takes
away all its blacknefs and beatity.  l'o prevent which, (if
you have not the conveniency of keeping it wartm, or front

and it will not freeze.  And, to hinder its motilding, put a

Of Secret Writing.
Here it may not be improper to fay fomething of fecrtt
writing; to which Bifhop Wilkins, in his book of Mathematical Magic, fpeak.s largely; but it is principally
concerning writing in cypher, which requires great painrs,
and an uncommon fhare of ingenuity, both in writers and
areaders.  But, however, I flhall fhew two or three particular
ways that are very pretty and amufing, and alfo very eafy,
both as to cott and pains. And,
Firfi, If you dip your pen in the juice of a lemos, or
of an onion, or in your own urine, or in fpirits of vitriol,
and write on clean paper whatever you intend, it fhall not
be difcerned till you hold it to the fire, and then it will
appear legible.  And if with any of the afore-mentioned
you write on your flin, as on your arm, and back of your
band, &amp;c. it fhall not be feen till you burn a piece of pa-,per, and with the afhes rub on the place, and then it will
appear very plain: and'this I have experienced and tried,
and, therefore, can fay, Probatum en.
Another way is, wlen you write a letter that you intend::            Xougng 2'Man':s BeJf Companion.
it fhall not be difcovered,'but to thofe you think fit, firf to
i write your thoughts on one fide of your letter with black
ink, as ufual (but it ought to be on thin paper) and then
on the contrary fide, -go over the faid matter that you
would have fecret, with a clean pen dipped in milk, and
that writing fhali not be read without holding it to the fire,
as mentioned above, and.then it will appear legible, in a
bluifh colour.
A third method is, to have two pieces of paper of equal
fize, and the uppermoft cut in chequered holes or. fquares,
big enough to co0ntain any word of ti: Otr feven fyllables,
and in thofe fquares write your mind in regular fenfe; and.
thert take'off the laid chequered paper, and fill up the vacancies with words of any kind, which will render it perfedt
nonfenfe, and not capable of being read to any purpofe of
intelligence: and tranfmit and fend the faid uppermoft, or
chequered paper,.or another exadly of the fame form, to
your correfpondent; whereby he flall, by laying it nicely.on your faid letter, read your intended fenfe, -without being
perplexed--with the words of atnufement intermixed, which
make it altogether unintelligible.
Or again, you- may write to your friend in proper fenfe
with common ink, and let the lines be at fo commodious a
-diftance, that what you mitended to be fecret may be written
between them, with water wherein galls have been rfeeped
a little time (but not long enough to tin&amp;ure the water;)
and, when dry, nothing of the writing between the faid
- lines can be feen; but, when it is to be read, you muji, with
a fine -hair pencil, dipped in copperas-water, go between the
faid lines, and fo you make it legible.
Note, This way will give no ground for fufpicion, becaufe
the letter feerneth to carry proper fenfe in. thofe lines that
are fet at fuch a proper diftance, &amp;c.
OF A     R I TH M E T IC.
After writing, the next' neceffary.fep t-owards qualifying a perfon for bufinefs,,is the underflanding that truly

And firft of Notation and Numeration.
In Notation, we mufl note or obferve, that all numbers
are expreffed by, or compofed of thefe ten figures or cha.raCters following, viz.
Orte, two, three, four, five, fix, feven, eight, nine, cypher.
I    2    3     4    5    6     7     8     9     o
Nine of thefe are called fignificant figures, to disfilguiih
them from the cypher, which, of itfelf, lignifies nothing;
but, as it is placed (in whole numbers) ferves to encreafe
the value of the next figure or figures that ftand before it;
as 3 is but three; but, before the cypher thus, 30,-- the
three becomes thirty, &amp;c.  But, in decimal fraftions (o)
decreafes the value of the figure behind it, for therein 3 is
three tenths of any thiig; but, by placing o before it thus,
03, it is decreafed from 3 tenth parts to three hundredth
parts of any thing, &amp;c.  We are to note, That every one,.or any of the above-mnentioned nine figures, or digits, have,two values; one certain, and another uncertain; the certain value is, when it ftands alone by itfelf; the uncertain is, when joined or placed with other figures or ciphers,
for, when any one of thefe figures itands alone, they fignify no more than their own fimple value; as, 5 is but five,
4 but four, 6 but fix,' and 3 no more than three, &amp;c.
And this is the certain value of a figure; but, when another figure or cypher is annexed, they then are encreafed
in their value ten times; as, 5, or 5 units, or ones, to 5
tens or fifty; 4 to 4 tens or forty; 6 to 6 otens or fixty;
and 3 to 3 tens or thirty; as thus, 5I, fifty-one; 42, forty-two; 63, fixty-three; 34-, thirty-four, &amp;c.   A:gain,
if any of the faid figures Rand in the third place towards
the left-hand, they fignify fo many hun-dreds, as they expreffed units or ones; as, 50o isfive hundreds, 400, four
hundreds, 600, fix hundreds, and 300, three hundreds,
&amp;c.   If any of them   poffefs the 4th place tovwards the
left-hand, they are fo- many thoufands as they contain
lunits; and fo any, or every figure, encreafes by tenfold
proportion, from the right-hand to the left, according toroung Man's BeJ   Companion.
the place it --is found or itands in; fo that 5 may be either
five or fifty; five hundred or five thoufand: in the firfc
place 5; in the fecond $o; in the third 5o;: in the
fourth place 5oo0, &amp;c.  The true value of figures in
conjunEtion may be fully learned and underitood by the
following table.

-  In addition of fimple numbers, whether it be yards
gallons, pounds, or any thing elfe, remember to carry I
for every lo that you find in the right-hand row, or rank
of figures, being units, to the next row of tens; anrd the
like from the rank of tenls to the row of hundreds, &amp;c.;
and, whatever it makes in the laft row, you mull fet down,
amount to what it will.
The numbers above are fet down in order, as before di--
re6ted; that is, units under units, tens under tens, &amp;c. as
may be-plainly underftood, by being indicated at the head
of each row' or rank, by U. T. H. &amp;c. i      9gnifying units,
tens, hundreds,' &amp;c. Then, in caling up each example,
to know its total, I begin at the rig-ht-hand, or units rank
of the firll example, and fay 2 and 4 is 6, and 6 is Iz,
and.8 is 20, and z is 22, and 4 is z6; in which row there
are two tens and 6 over; wherefore, I fet down 6 juft under its own rank, and carry two to the next row, and fay,
2 that I carry and:4 makes 6, and 2 is 8, and 8 is I6, and
6 is 22, and 4 is 26, and 2 is 28; and this being the laR
iow, I fet down the amount, viz. 28; fo that the total
number of yards is found to be 286. And the afmiount of
the next or fecohd example is found, by the fame method,
to b]e 3562 gallons. And, in the third and laf example,
the total number of pounds is found, by the fame way, to
be 247484.   And fo the total of anyl other example of
the fame kind,- viz. fimple numbers of one denomination,
- may be found. Note, That when any of the ranks amounts
to jul I0o, 20, 30, 4.o,50, &amp;c. then you mutt fet down
the o under its proper rank, and carry either I, z, 3, 4, or
5, according to the number of tens that you find, to the
next row.' And fo much for addition of numbers of-one denomination, which never varies from what has been faid above;

In thefe examples the manner of proceeding is the fame
as in the former, obferving, that the number of uints of
each leffer denomination, which makes an unit of the. next
Cgreater, found by the preceding table, is placed above each
rank of numbers; that is to fay, in the firft example, 28,
the number of pounds contained in a quarter of a hundred
weight, is placed over the column of pounds; now, that
column, when added up, makes 78, which contains two
28's and 22 over, wherefore I fet down 22-under the column of pounds, and carry 2 to the column f quarters, and
fo on.
eC0:  Note, That in weighing at the water-fide, or elfewhere, they do not weigh by the tun, though fome goods
are fold by it, as, iron, logwood, cheefe, &amp;c. but by the
hundreds, quarters, and pounds, which are afterwards reduced to and computed by tuns.

How to prove Addition.
In all additions, whether of fimple numbers, that is,
numbers of one denomination; or in examples compound,
that is, of divers denominations, as, pounds, fhillings,
pence, and farthings, &amp;c. the readieft method of proof
is to caPR the fame downwards (beginning at the top, as
you did the fame upwards beginning at the bottom,) and
if that operation produces the'fame total, the work is infallibly right, and beyond any contradidaion; and this is
mriuch better,'and more feafible, than the common method
ufed in fchoQls, of making two totals, by omitting the upper line in the fecond.,I might here alfo give feveral examples of other additions, fuch as Apothecaries weight,
cloth, liquid, dry, and long meafures, time, &amp;c.; but7-'ounMr Man's BeJf Companion.     69

An,d fo much for fubtraation; which method will ferve

-The next rule in order is multiplication, and perhaps the
mofl ferviceable rule in bufinefs, for its quick difpatch, of
all others in arithmetic, which I fhall endeavour to ihow by
its nature, quality, and ufe. Now,
F. Multiplication is a rule, that by two numbers given
teacheth to find out a third, which fhlall contain either of
the two as many times as the other containeth an unit.
2. Multiplication is alfo a compendious working of addition.
3. It ferves likewife to bring great denominations into
fmall, as, pounds into fhillings, pence, or farthings.
4. Havinig the length and breadth of a plane furface, we
find its content in fuperficial or fquare meafuire.
5. By multiplication we find, having the value of one
thirg, or the wages of one perfon, how to know-the value of
many fuch things, or the wages of many fuch perfons.
In multiplication we are particularly'to take notice of
thefe three terms, viz.
Multiplicand,
-  The  Multiplier, and
Tte LProduft.
-   The multiplicand (generally the greater of the two
numbers) is the number to be multiplied.
2. The multiplier (generally the leffer of the two numbers) is the number by which the former is to be multiplied.
3. The produ&amp;t is the reftilt of the work or anfwer.
The multiplier and multiplicand are colletively called
faAors.
But before any procedure can be made in this rule, it is
neceffary to have the following table by heart, and that very
perfe&amp;fly.roun g Man's Bej7 Companion.       79

The table is fo plain and eafy, that -there is n6o need of
dire&amp;ion; for the piduet of any two,figures will be found
in that fquare, which is. on a line with the one, and under
the other; thus 54, the produeta of 6 and 9, will be found
on a line with 6, anfd under 9, o oon a line with 9, and
under 6;. fo 7 times 8 is 56, and 8 times 7 is' 56, &amp;c.
And thus the table ought to be got by heart, for the more
dexterous readinefs in multiplying.
Now for the application.
Example I. How many are 3 times 472? Which  472
being fet down in the margin, I fay, 3 times 2 is  3
6, which place under 3 the multiplier;- then 3.
times 7 is 21; fet down I under 7, and carry z for' I4 6
the two- tens,,as in addition of one denomination;
then 3 times 4 is Ix2 and 2 carried is 14; whiclh
