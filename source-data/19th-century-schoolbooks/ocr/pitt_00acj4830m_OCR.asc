x7. "Does Mr. WVhite think so?" asked Lily.
"He knows all about law, and he ought to know
what is right, and teach his boys to do it."
8. "We need not go to law to find out what is
right. There is a book that says,'WThat you
woulcl that men should do to you, do you even
so to them.' That law tells us always what
to do."
9. "Well, motller," sai(d Lily, " if those boys
know this law, and mind it, they will not touch
my grapes."
1(). Lily now watched her grapes daily.  She
took great care of the vine, dug round it, and
gave it water when it was dry. By and by the
grapes were fully ripe.
11. So she got a basket, and she and Mary 1
went to pick them.  Mlary held the basket, while
Lily took off the four bunches that hlung on this
side; then put her hland round to get tlle two that
were on fMr. White's side. But they were not
there.
12. "My two  best bunches are gone," saiCd
Lily, the tears coming to her eyes. " Mr. WVhite's
boys must have taken them. I do thilnk it is too
bad. If their grlapes had hung on our side, we
would not have taken them."
13. Poor Lily could not keep the tears back,
as shle told her imother of lher loss. IIer mother
told her she Imust bear it like a brave girl, aud
that no doubt hler father would give her s*X
bunches to make up for it.

LESSON L.
THE GRAPE-VINE.
(Cout/n? utcd.)
1. The day after the grapes were missed, Lily
heard one of Mr. White's boys say, "Bill, you
took Lily's grapes, for you said they wvelre yours.
Now, ten of your peaches hang on her side of
the fence.  Will you let her have tllhem?"
2. " No," said Bill, " I want them Imynself. She
shall not have them.  I'll pick them  filrst before ]
they are ripe."
3. "I would not,"' said the other.  " I don't believe she will take them.  Her mother would not
let her."
4.. A few days after this, Lily's mother said to
het, " Do-you wish to pick those peaches, Lily?"
5. "No," said Lily.  "I should not like to
make them feel as we did when we went to pick
our grapes."
6;. "Get a dish, then," said the mother. "They
cannot reach them. So we will take tlleml off,
anrd sen(l them  in to Bill. We will pick them
with care.  Bill knows there are just ten."
7. They picked the peaches, and sent them in
to Bill. lWhlen lie saNw the dish and the ten
peaches, he blushed with sllame.
8. "Tlhis makes ime feel," said lhe, " as if I did
wriong wlihen I took Lily's grapes. I didl not think
I did wrolCI  at the tillue I took them; but now I
am sure I did.  I will never take any more of her...... _.          -.,.... - S 0fruit, and I mean to send her back five of these
peaches."
9. So five of the peaches came back to Lily.
"See," said her mother, "good brings good. You
might have kept up a war all the time with those
boys.
10. "Your one good act has made Bill feel how
wrong his own was, and aroused in his heart a
sense of what is right and just."

LESSON LI.
UNCLE JOE AND THE BEAR.
1. "Well, now, miss, what can I do for you?"
So spoke black Uncle Joe to Inez, who had
brought her cousin Johnny down to his cabin to
see him.
2. Have you forgot Inez and Johnny?  Have
you forgot the story of the cotton-plant, which I
told you of? Turn back to page 86, and you
can read it again.
3. Uncle Joe was one of Mr. Alden's servants.
He loved his master, and his master's little daughter, Inez; and Inez often went down to his cabin
to see him, and carry him something he liked.
4. Uncle Joe was almost too old to work now.
His hair was gray. He liked to sit by his cabin
a                                               aLin the sun, and sleep; and he liked, too, to talk
of old times.
5. " Nowv, Uncle Joe," said Inez, "I want you
to tell Johnny how you. killed the bear.  We will
just sit down here, while you tell it;" and Inez
and Johnny both took their seats on a bench, that
stood by the cabin.
6. "WVell," said Uncle Joe, "you'member,
child, I told you I haven't always lived down
here. WVhen I first grew up, I'longed to Master
James, your' grandfather, and he used to live in
Vilginny first, and then he came down to this
very place.
7. "BWhen he came here, plantations were not
as thick as they are now. Well, one day we
were out in the far end of that cotton-field you
see yonder, making a clearing.
8. " After the sun was down, Caesar and I said
we would catch a coon before we went home.
So we went into the woods, round the back of
our cornfield, and by that time it was right dark,
though the stars gave so,ne light.
9. "Well, when we got there, and was looking
round to see if we could find any thing of mister
coon, Caesar,he looked round to the cornfield and
gave me such a jerk, he almost flung me on
my face.
10. "And when I looked round, there was a
great, big, fat man, with his arms full of corn, a
climbing over the fence.
11. "I looked at him, and says I to Caosar,'it
a                                                awon't do for us to be working that corn just to(have it stole in that kind of way.'"
12. "' That it won't,' says Csesair, and with that
he hollars after the man. B3ut the man would
not answer, but kept running away.
13. "Then Csesar ran after him, and caugllt
hold of one of his arms. The next minute he
let fall his corn, and put his arms lround Csesar.
14. "'Let me go,' said Csesar.'You will
squeeze me to death. Let me go, I tell you. If
you don't let me go, I'll stick my knife into you.
Joe, he's squeezing me to death. Hit him  in the
head with the hatchet you have got.'
15. "I hit him one clrack, but that only made
him squeeze Caesar the harder. Then I hit him a
mighty hard crack, and he fell down just as if
he were dead.
16. " Golly, Missy, warn't me and Caesar scared,
for we thought we had killed a man. I tell you,
we went home in a hurry. But we didn't sleep
a bit that night.
17. "As soon as it was daylight, we went to
see what: had become of the man.  And instead
of a man lying there, we saw a great, big, dead
bear!
18. " We hitdn't been used to see bears about
our coinfields in Virginny, and Caesar and I
never thought a bear would carry off corn just
for all the world like a man.
19. " But I tell you what, we jumped for joy
when we found it was not a man, but only a bear,
e.       w               S.we had killed.  Casar and I were just the proudest darkeys that day you ever see.
20. "And lhow  AMaster James did laugh when
we told hli  all about it!  Lol, Missy Inez and
Mlister Jollnny, old MaIaster Jlames thought a heap
of us darkeys, lie (lid."
21. Johnny and Inez thanked  Uncle Joe for
hlis story  of the bear, and( Johnny wanted to
know if rle batd any nlore stories to tell him.
22. Uncle Joe said( he could tell a good many
things about ol(l times, and that if Johnny would

VISIT TO THE SUGAR-CANE PLANTATIONS.
1. Uncle John told Johnny that he would take
him to see a sugar plantation btefore he went
home. Johnny clapped his hands with delight,
and asked if Inez cotuld go too.
2. Uncle John said yes, although they would
have to go some miles, and sail in a steamboat.
But Uncle John knew a sugar planter, and lie
saidt they might go to his house, and stay a day
or two.
3. So they rode to the town, and when the
steamboat came along, they got on board. Uncle
John, in a little while, pointed out to Johnny the
sugar plantations along the bank of the river.
0P  
__I__C
VI.4. " But what is the wall along the river for?"
asked,Johnny.
5. "That," said Uncle John, "is a' levee.' It' is
built of mud and earth, and is meant to keep
back the current of the river, which sometimes,
without this bank, would overflow.
6. ") Do you see those long plains of green, that
stretch almost as far as your eye can reach?
They are the sugar-cane.  What a level sea of
green!  The su'face is as even as the surface of
a lake."
7. " Mhy is it all cut up in' squares?'." asked
Johnny.
8. " Every two hundred feet," said Uncle John,
"a deep ditch is dug to drain off the water; and
cross-ditches are also dug, about six hundred feet
apart; and so the cane is planted in great oblong
spaces, not exactly squares, as you call them."
9. The steamboat soon stopped at a small town
on the river, and Mr. Alden, Johnny, and Inez
went ashore. Mr. Henry, which was the planter's
name, lived only a short distance firom the landing, and so they all walked up to his house.
10. They were welcomled with open hands and
hearts.  Mr. Henry had a little girl, named Mary,
who was about the age of Iuiez, and a little boy,
called I-Iarry, who was a little older than Johnny.
So they all made a nmerry palty.

THIRD READER.11. The next day, they went to see the sugarcane. It was now almost as tall as a inan'll  headl,
and of a dark, rich green.  Johnny wondered
how sugal could be made out of those green
stalks.
12. Mr. Henry told him how, when the cane
was ripe, it was cut down, and the green leaves
stripped off, and'the stalks carried to the mill,
which Johnny could see standing not fLar from
where they landed fiom the steamboat.
13. In thte mill, the cane-stalks were crushed
under heavy rollers, until the juice was pressed
out. Then the juice was boiled  iu immnnense
boilers, until the water in the juice wrenit ofF into
steam, and what was left was a rich, b1rown sugar.
14. Mr. Henry also told him, tllat they planted
the cane only about once in three years; the cane
springing up) firolm the iroots in the other years. He
also told hiln that it took al)out nine months to
grow, and that was the reason why it could only
be raised in hot countries, where there is not
much winter.
15. "If a firost should come," said Mr. Henry,
"before the cane was cut, the crop would bej
ruined. The leaves we strlip firom the cane cover  
the ground during the winter, and priotect the
roots from the frost."
16. Harr y now began to tell Johnny what grand
fun they had when b,oiling the juice. " We all
eat just as much sugar as we please-dotn't we,
papa?".j~~~                                     ------~17. "Yes," said IMr. Henry, "and we all get very
hearty and fat in sugar-boiling tilime. The negroEes,
too, chew  the cane all the time; and, although
they have extra lhard -work at that title, they are
I never in such good spirits. It is thought to be
very wlholesolime."
18. "IIow I should like to le hele," said Johnnvy,  
I" and see 3you make sugar! I don't know which I
would like best, if I were a mau, to,be a cottonplanter or a sugar-plauter.  But I mean to ask
papt to come South and live."
19. Inez, and Alary, and Iarry, all cried out,
that that would be fine, and that they mleant to
ask Mr. Alden, wbhen they saw him, if he would  
not do so.

SIGNS AND MARKS USED IN READING.
The Coml  (; ) is the shortest pause. Pause while you say one.
The SEMIoLoN (;  ) is the next longest stop. Pause while you
count two.
The COLON (:) is somewhat longer than the semicolon. Pause
while you count three.
The PERIOD (. ) is a full-stop, and ends the sentence. Pause
while you count four.
The INTERROGATION (?) is used when a question is asked; as,
Who is that? Pause as long as at a period, or full-stop.
The ExcLAMATION (I ) is used to express wonder or emotion; as,
What a nice book! or, How terrible! It requires a longer pause
than the period.
The DAsH (-) denotes an unfinished sentence, or a sudden
change of subject; as, Iflew to the spot--she was not there!
EXPLANATION OF OTHER MARKS.
The APosTROPmn (') denotes the omission of one or more letters; as, ne'er. It is also used as the sign of the possessive case;

LESSOF LIV.
TElE PIPER.
1. A queer storly is told of a piper and his magic
pipe, in a town in Germany.
2. It seems that once there were so many rats
in this town, the good people did not know what
to do. The rats ate up the malt, the corn, the
cheese, and were a great plague.
3. At last, one day a piper came into the town,
and said he would rid the people of the rats for
a certain sum of money, to be paid as soon as his
task was done.
4. The town council then met; and, after a
grave debate, it was agreed -to pay the piper the
0:::::sum he asked, if he should succeed in driving off  
the rats.
5. So the piper went into the street, and taking
his stand near the centre of the town, began to
play on his pipe a new, strange tune.
6. All at once there was a great noise and
rumble in all the closets of the town; and soon
out of their holes, and out of the doors, and
through the windows, the rats came jumping and
tumbling. Such a lot of thein you never saw.
7. Then the piper went slowly down the street,
playing on his pipe, and all the rats followed
behind him. There was something in the. tune
the piper played that charmed the rats, an(l (llew
theDifter him.
8. So the piper, still playing on his pipe, went
down to the river with all the rats close to his
heels. When he came to the river he got into a
boat, and sailed out into the stream; and all the
rats, as they tried to follow him, tumbled, one
after the other, into the river, and were drowned.
9. When the people saw this, they were
amazed, and they went to the council to discuss
the strange event. One said, as the rats were all
drowned, it was no use to pay tht piper now.
Besides, it was clear he dealt in magic, and magic i
was against the law.
10. And so when the piper came for his money,
they told him he had drowned the rats by magic,
and that magic was so wicked a thing, they could
not by their laws have any thing to do wit- him.

1 1. The piper told them they would rue their
bad faith, if they did not pay him. They only
laughed at him, for they were bad men, and
wanted to cheat the piper out of the money they
had agreed to pay.
12. When the piper found the people would not
pay him, he went once moire out into the street,
and began to play a tune, but not the same he
had played before. No one in that town had
ever heard so sweet a tune as that which the
piper now began to play.
13. And then of a sudden, all the boys and girls
came running from their play, and their books,
and their schools, to hear the tune. All the street
was filled with them, for not a boy or girl could
stay away firom the music of that strange and
wonderful tune.
14. They were charmed by it, just as the rats
had been charmed by the other tune. So the
piper went slowly down the road, with all the
boys and girls of the whole town following close
at his heels.
15. He came to the bridge, and crossed it, kept
on the road beyond, and went up the hill. Still,
all the boys and girls, charmed by the magic tune,
followed him,-afraid it would,seem, to lose a note
of his pipe.
16. Up the hill he led them, and over the top;
and this was the last that was e~'vr seen of the
piper or the boys and girls. What became of them
no one ever knew.
0a
__17. Then the people called a council againl; but
the piper and all the boys and gilMls were gone, and
could not be found. The people then were sorry
they had not paid the piper the sum they had
agreed to pay him.  Had they been honest, they
would not have met with this terrible loss.
18. Perhaps this story is not true. I do not
know. It is told by the great poet, Browning,
in a very pretty poenm, called " The Pied Piper of
Hainelin."
19. It shows very plainly blow wrong it is to
do wicked things, and how soon we may be punished for them.

II2. But I would not like to cut thee down, for
the birds would miss thy branches, and the sheep
and the cows would feel the want of thy shade.
3. I would not like to cut thee down now, old
tree, for thou must have stood here scores of
years. Cold and keen blasts have blown on thee,
hail and rain have wet thee, snow has hung on
thy branches, and the sun's hot rays have scorched
thee.
4. When the soft breath of spring blows on
thee, thou puttest on a new, bright green. cloak,
and when the cold and the frost come upon thee,
thou lettest it fall, to the ground.
5. But He who made thee, and gave thee
power to bear the heat'and breast the storm, gave
thee a good store of cloaks within thyself, so that
each year thou canst put on a new one.
6. And when thy new green cloak is first seen,
whence come all these songs of joy that are heard
in thy boughs? They come firom the redbirds,
and the bluebirds, and the blackbirds, who try
to tell thee how glad they are to see thee in thy
green dress.
7. They build their nests amid thy leaves,
and feel that, in the folds of thy green robes,
they can find a sweet home for their blue eggs.
8. And when, in due time, the blue eggs are
no more seen, but the young birds come forth
from their nests, what sounds of love, and what
notes of praise, are heard amid thy sprigs.
9. But we do not think all these notes of praise

sent forth to Him who made thee.
10. Who can think it strange that thou shouldst
love to live so well, and cling to earth so long?
11. We cannot say of thee that thou art owned
by none. Fathers left thee as a rich gift to their
sons; men have bought and sold thee as a thiing
for which gold was to be paid.
12. I have been to far-off lands. I have seen
trees whose fruit yields bread,* and I have seen
trees that pour forth white mlilkt that is of great
use to mnan; and I have seenl the spice-trees, and
the cocoa, and the leimon.

LESSON LVII.
THE SHEPHERD'S DOG AND CHILD.
1. One day, a shepherd, on going to his flock,
which were feeding on the sides of a mountain,
took his little boy with him  as well as a dog.
The child was only three years old.
2. The fathei left him alone with his dog, while
he wenit in searc'h of some of the sheep, when all

iat once a thick fog came on. The father went
back to find his child, but it was so dark he could
not see any thing of him, and he also missed his
way.
3. For hours he searched among the caverns
and holes in the mountain, until night came on,
but no trace of the child could he find. He now
saw by the light of the moon that he was near
his own cottage.
4. He hoped the child had reached home, but
found it was not so. His wife had seen nothing
of him, nor had the dog been heard of.
5. Next morning, at break of day, the shepherd,
with a band of friends, set out in. search of the
child. All day they sought for him, and when
night came on, the child still had not been found.
6. When the shepherd reached his cottage, he
found that the dog had been home, and on getting
a piece of cake, had at once gone off again. For
three days the shepherd searched for the child;
and each night, on coming back to the cottage,
he learned that the dog had been home, and gone
off with a piece of cake.
7. Struck with the fact, the shepherd stayed at
home one day; and when the dog, as usual, came
for his piece of cake, he resolved to follow him,
and find out the cause of his strange conduct.
8. The dog led the way to a water-fall, at some
distance fiom the spot where the shepherd had
left the child.  The shepherd, stepping from
crag to crag, clossed the stream after the dog.The (log at last ran inlto a cave, the moutll of.which was nearly o0n a level nwitli thle stream.!  9. The slihlpherd followed, anid as lie ireached
the cave, what was his surprise aind deliLht to see
his child safely wit{lin, and eating the c,ake wvhich
Ithe dog hnad just brougght hiim!
10. From  the place in wrhich  the child was
found, it seemed that he ha(l gone onI over the
rough ground, anid hadc  either fallen or crept
down the rocky sides of the waterl-fall, until he
reached the cave, which he had Ilnot dal'ed to leave
froin fear of the water-fall.
11. The dog, by means of his sceint, had traced
him  to the spot, ad1 therle watched  over hliml,

082. The Sun said he was the strongest, because
he coul(d suck tup gr1eat rivers into tile clouds with
his rays, ail( because he could melt with his heat
I the great icebergs that came down on the ocean
friom the north.
3. At last it was agireed, in order to decide the
nmatter, that they should each try their power on
a man who was walking along the road.  He,
whvo shoul(d first compel the man to thl:ow off the
cloak he wore, should win the day.
4. First, the Wind began.  IIe blew a fierce
blast, that filled the air with dust, and broke the
linmbs of trees. But the man only buckled his
cloak around him tighter, and getting under the
side of a hill, where the wind could not reach
him, waited until it should cease to blow.
5. The Wind having failed to force him to
throw off his cloak, it ceased to blow, and the
man resum:ed his journey.  Nov it was the Suin's
turn. It begani by pouring down1 fi'om the sky
its rays so hot and steady, that the man was
almost melted.
6. He sooni cried out, " The heat of tllis Sun is
altogether t.oo hot to bear-one mighlt as well be
in an oven;" and with this lie )paused in the shade
of a trlee, and threw off his cloak upon the
groun(d.
7. The Sun proved the winner. NoNw what do
you suppose this fable teaches us?  Does it not
show that gentle mneans will succeed where mere
forlce will fail?

LESSON LX.
THE FISHING PARTY.
1. Are you fond of angling?S These three
boys with their poles and lines are angling for
trout.
2. The trout is a very handsome fish. Its
scales are of many bright colors. It is what is
called a game-fish-that is, it is halrd to catch;
and when caught on the hook, it takes an expert
hand to get it safely ashore.
3. It is found in small streams, in the deep,
a
a -la  
13
Ishady pools. There is a kind found in lakes,
called the Lake-trout.
4. Once, two boys, James and Harry, went a
trout-fishing. It was along the bank of a fine
trout stream in Maryland. James had left his
line in the water, to look after some of the fish
that had been caught,and which lay in the cool
grass.
5. All at once, Harry called out, "Look at
your line! A great big fish is on it." James
turned round quick, and just in time to see his
pole pulled into the water, and both line and pole
go rushing down the stream.
6. It was clear that a very large fish had been
caught on the hook, and was running off with
the line. Away went James and Harry along
the bank, watching the course of the pole.
7. " Run in and get it," said Harry. " It is too
deep to wad:' said James. So they kept running on, soon getting ahead of the fish, until they
saw, a little way down the stream, a boat moorled
to the bank.
8. They now ran on as fast as they could,
jumped into the boat, and pushed it out into the
stream. They were now ahead of the line, and
so they hoped to catch it as it came floating
on.
9. Harry steered the boat with one oar, and
James stood in the bow. Just as the fish came
rushing on, dragging the pole, James made a
clutch at it. He caught the pole, but came.near

120falling head foremost out of the boat in trying
to do so.
10. Now came the sport. Away went the fish.
James let out the line. The fish seemed to stop,
and James began to pull in the line slowly, and
with care.
11. After a time the strength of the fish began
to give out, and James at last got it into the
boat. It was very large, the largest fish of the
kind James had ever seen.
12. James, after this, was fond of telling how
a fish had almost irun off with his hook and line,
and what a big fellow it was.

TRUE CHARITY.
1. "Mother," said Alice, "I wish you would
give ime a penny, to give to Alhat poor boy
t:in the stree.t  Ile looks very hungry, and says
he has not had any thing to eat all day.  I am
so sorry for himi!  Do let me give him a penny to
&lt; buy a roll."
2. "I thouight you had a penny of your own,
Alice, that your falther gave you this morning.
lie gave you and Ilarry a penny each."'
3. "Yes, inother, but I want mine to buy a
cake while I arn out."
"Do you think you shall be hungry while youk
are otUt?" asked Alice's mother.
4.'" I do not know, mother," said Alice."If you think so, you may take a piece of
bread and butter with you."
"But I like cake best, mother," replied Alice.
5. " I am afraid, Alice, you are not very sorry
fo1 the poor boy. You would rather let him go
away hlungry than give up the pleasure of eating
a cake, although you have had a good breakfast,
and he has had nlone."
6. Just at this moment Harry came to the
house, and said: " Here, poor boy, is a penny for
you. I was going to buy a cake with it; but I
am not hungry, and you are. So you may have
the penny."
7. then Alice hung down her head, and looked
ashlamed  for a moment, for just then her father
came in. But soon she looked up, and said:
"Father, I am -sorry I was so stingy. Here is my
pennly; please take it and give it to the boy."
8. The father took the penny, and gave it to
the poorI boy, and also gave him a large piece of
loaf-bread. The boy thanked him, and seemed
very happy.
9. Alice was not unkind, but she was selfish.
She would have gladly given the boy her penny
at first, could she have done so without losing
something which she liked.
10. But she did not like to give up her own
pleasures for the sake of others. People who
feel this way do not have true charity. Only
those have true charity who are willing to give:away that which they like and want, when they

BIRD-NESTING.
1. Boys are fond of hunting for birds' nests.
They seem to think they have
got a great prize, when they
find, hid away among the
bushes, a little nest, full of,
small, blue eggs, or speckled c  
white eggs.
2.. They think, too, it is a'5.
great feat to climb a tiree,
and in spite of the wild crlies:
of the old birds, to rol) the   
nest of its egg-s, or of its newly lhatched young ones.
3. But they should reflect                I  
hlow cruel such sporlt is to the  
birds.  Let themli thiuk how
I Iuch labor and titme it costs
the birds to build their pretty nests, and with:
what   patielce e
and love they will
sit on their eggs:;,
until  they  are
hatched.
4. And when,:
at last, the little         _         ~.'.:...
ones are out of                  *v,

0-athem, night and (lay, does it not seem to you harld
to have their young carried off by cruel boys?
5. Sonietiin:'. a boy, when climbing atree after
a nest., will slip froln  a branch, anLd fall to the
giountl.  If he escapes with his life, very likely
his arm, or. leg Swill be b,roken.
6. I)o not, thenl, clilnb the trees; and let the
pretty birds and their nlests alone.  Wait a little
while, and the young l)irds will be able to fly,
anid in time will build their nests in the trees,
and have yotlungr ones, too.  It is pleasant to have
1)lenty of birds in tlhe bushes and the trees around
our houses.
7. Do you like to hear the birds sing?  What
do you suppose they sing about?  What can it
he, unlless it is about their nests, and their young
ones, and the flowers, and the trees, and the bright
sunshine?
8. Some thilnk tlle birds sing only to tell their
love to eacll other, and to show how happy they
are.  Perl:aps this is so; for it is said, they will
sing all the sweeter after they have had a quarrel
and a fight: and pelrhaps that is the way of mnaking it up again.
9. And we know that even'little brothers and
sisters, just like the b,irds, will sometimes peck at
each other; then kiss and become friends the next
mome nt.
10. But to shosw you how kind birds are to
each other, I must tell you, that while the female
bird is sitting 1)up1n herl eggs, to hatchl them, the,3--._,-                           e

I
i
i'WI---Imale bird seldom  goes far away firom  herl, but
will perch upon a bough, near at hand, and will
sing to hel', hour after lhour, in order that she may
not be lonesome in her long, weary task.
1 1. And as he sings, he seems to say: " I know,
nmy dear, you must stop at home, and keep your
eggs warlm, or the young ones will all die.' But
never mind, it will not be for long; and when
they are able to fly and take care of themselves,
we will have many a happy r'amble again through
the green woods; and until that time comles I will
never leave you."
12. Some think the old birds teach the young
ones to sing, the same as mothers teach their childlen to talk.  But this can hardly be true, for
their young ones are only just able to chirp whilst
they aire under the care of the oldeir birds; and
it is not until the next sprling that they begin to
break out into song.
13. Neither do the old birds teach the young
ones how to build their nests. How, then, do
you suppose they learn to sing and make their
nests without being taught? The instinct to do
these things is planted in their hearts by the
maker and creator of all things-the great and
good God.

LESSON LXVI.'
JUST THIS ONCE.
1. Once a teachelr, by the name of Mr. White,
and'a number of his scholairs, went into the
woods to pick berries and enjoy a half holiday.
The smlaller boys Mr. White kept near his own
perlson, but the rest were told they might wander
off as they pleased in searlch of the berries.
2. "But," said he, "you must not forget the
rule. You may enjoy and amuse yourselves any
way you please, but you must not climb the trees.
There must be no robbing of the birds, or any
thing of that sort."
3. With these words firom, Mr. White, the boys
stairted off, each eager to see if he could not pick
the most belXrries. They soon found plenty of
large blackberr-ies; and in a little while the
baskets were filled.
4. All at onlce, one of the boys, Frank Raynor,
called out, "Look there, boys! Do you see that
pigeon's nest?"  And as he spoke, he pointed to
the top of a tall tree.
5. We all rushed to the spot, and there, high
up in the tree, saw the nest, with the two old
pigeons flying in and out, feeding their young.
We watched( them for some time, when Frank
spoke.
6. "What a pity," said he, "that Mr. White
told us ncat to clilimb the tree! I should so like to
have a look at those young ones."
a,,c
-07. "Well, why don't you'?" said Harry.  "It
is only just for once, and no one need be the
wiser."
8. " Oh, don't," said little Arthur Howit. "You
know what Mr. White said, so don't let us spoil
the day by breaking orders."
9~. "And how is he to know it, you little coward?" said Harry. " Come, Frank, you clitmb up,
and bring it down, if you can. Don't be alarmed,
it is only for this once."
10. But Frank put his hands in his pockets,
and did not move. Harly kept ul'ging him to
climb the tree, until at last he said, " Why don't
you go yourself? You would like me to go, but
dare not do it yourself."
11. "But it was you who wanted to see the
birds," said Hhrly.  " However, I will go up, if
you will watch and let me know if anybody is
conling."
12. To this Frank agreed, and Halirry had just
put his arms round the trunk of the tree, when
the voice of Mr. White fell'upon his ear.  He
started, and turned around in fear.
13. " What arle you doing there, Harry 2" said
Mr. White. There was a stern look on his face,
as he spoke, that made Harry feel very guilty,
and so he hung his head for very shame.
14. "What were you going to do?" he asked
again, but more sternly.
15. "If you please, sir," said Harry, for he
knew that he must answer, "if you please, I was
0                               only going to look into a pigeon's nest. I did
not think there would be any harm just for once."
16. "And so you thought," said MIr. White,
"because it was only for once, it would not be
wrong. Come, now, tell me yourlself, if you
would not have disobeyed me just as much as if
you had done it a dozen times."
17. "Yes, sir," said Harry, after a pause. "But
I thought it would not much matter, if I only did
it one time."
18. "What! not matter whether you do riight
or wrong? Not matter whether you obey or disobey?  I am ashamed to hear one of my boys
talking like that.
19. "Oh, boys!" and here Mr. White turned
round to the others, " never let that idea get into
your heads, that you may do wrong just for once,
for that thought often begins a life of evil and
wrong-doing.
20. "Only this once, has been the first step to
ruin of many who never meant to be any thing
but what was upright and good. They have disobeyed their parents'only this once,' and it has
led to a life of evil.
21. "They have told an untruth'only this
once,' and it has led to so many falsehoods, no
one would ever trust or believe in them.'Only
4' this once,' never stops with once. If you tell a
AR'  lie once, you will be sure to do it a second, a
&gt;i   third, and then many times.
22. "My dear boys, you must learn never to
/f3IJ\coinsent to do a wrong thinog even once.  Be
honest at first as well as at last.  Tell the truth
now, and at all timles. Obey just as much in onle
thing, and at one timre, as in other things, or at
other times.
23. "Harry, the next time we lhave lholiday,
you cannot go with us. Nor must you pl;ly with
the boys again to-day."
24. Harry was very sorry, and begged  Mr.
White's pardon, who told him  that
give him, if he saw that he tlru
had been told him.

INFLECTION is the bending or sliding of the voice, either upward or downward. There are two inflections, the rising inflection
and the falling inflection.
The rising inflection, marked thus ('), is an upward slide of the

3. "Well," said M,r. Aldlen, "I intend to return
to New Yo,rk by waly of Charleston, and I think
we shall have a chance to see the rice growing.
The irice plantations, you know, Johnny, are mostly
ill (Georgia an (- South Ca,lolina."
4. Uncle John tol( them that r ice grlew on low,
marshy grounll, aiear the sea-coast, and that the
plantels di(d not live on their plantatious in the
sumn,ler-time.  "No one'but negroes," lle said,
"could  stand the mnatlaria that rises from  the
swamps and mairslles."

i5. " Wllat is Illll'aria?" askIted Jollllli.
"MaI.larlia," said Uncle Johnl, "is t.lhe bad air
rising fiolm stagnant water and irotten leaves.  It
causes (leadtly fevers.  In the rice regions, it is
fatal to all but the negroes."
6. "We shall have to visit the plantations in
the day-time," said AMr. Alden, "and return at
night to some safe place, out of the ireach of the
malaria."
7. They had a good deal morle talk about rice.
Johnny said he tlhougllt irice-pudding the best
pudding in the worldl; but Inez said she liked
plumr-pludd(ing the best.
S. Two days after this, Johnnly bid Uncle John
an(l Ilez good-by, and he and his fittherl started
oil their travels.  They hlad to ridle in the ca1rs a
good nany dalys beforle they reachied Charileston.
9. After they reache(d Chalrleston, Mr. Alden
hald his btisiness to attend to, which took a few
d(ays.  On the fourth day, he told Johnny that
the next lday they would visit the plantations.
10. A MR. Wyld, who owned a plantation, had
agileed to go with them  dowvn to visit the ricefields.  They rode some hours in the cars, and
stopping at a small station, got out, and there
they found a carriage waiting for them.
11. As Jollnny and his friends-drew near the
plantations, Mr1. Wyld pointed out to them  the
r-ice-fiel(ls, tlhe grlaill l,enlding with its heavy, golden
lhea(ds.
12. IMr. Wyldl told Johnny it was almnost ripe
-..,,.        ---_     _           --  _ _ -_for the harvest.  "It is not," sai(d he," much unlike wheat, although each stalk has a number of
I branches, which wvheat has not."
13. Johnny could see it in long stretches of gold
and green, as far almost as his eye could reach.
But when they got nearer, he saw that the grain
was covered with water.
14. " Why is it all under water?" said Johnny.
"Isll't that queer!"
"Yes," said Mr. Wyld, "rice grows best in the
water, or on very wet ground."
15. Mr. Wyld then pointed out the long banks
of earth, looking like the "levees" that keplt (ut
the riverl from the sugar-fields.
16. Then, Mr. Wyld told Jollhnny, that once
all these fields wer'e one vast swanmi), filled with
water, overlgrown with inmlense plants, vines, andl
trees, alnd full of alligatoi-s and otherl animals.
17. The trees and plants hlad  to b(e clea-red
away, and then deep ditches (lug to ldrain the
land.  Along each ditch a high batlk was throwvn
up, and gates bulilt in the bank, which could be
liftedl up (or pushed down.
18. " Wh'llat were they for?" asked Johnny.
"In order," sai(l Mr. Wyld, "tllhat the landmay
lbe drained( of the watel, and the Iice planted,;nd after it is planted, the water let in again.
19. "Certain gates are to be lifted when tlle
water is to be drawni off.  And it all flows illto
the ditches, and rulis off into thle sea.  Wheni the
water is to be let in, other gates are to be lifte'd,
u_ ~     ~     -----,                  __  __  @  iand the water fiolm the river flows in over the
ground.
20. Johnny had  healrd so  much about the
plough and the hoe, in his visit to the cotton and
sugar plantations, that he asked Mr. WVyld if they
did not eveir hoe the rice.
21. "Yes," said Mr. Wyld, "the water is drawn
off sometimes for that purpose."  Mr. Wyld then
went on to explain hoxv, by covering the lrice
wvith water, all weeds were killed, and the: seed
and young plants kept safe firomi the birdls, which
were ve!ry numlelrous, and would otherwise devour them.
22. They spent some hours among the lrice
fields, and then went to see the long rows of negro huts, looking like the streets of a village.
The negrloes wel'e already stopping workl, and
mneetinog in groups around their doors, to chat
an(i smoke.
23.  On thle rice plantations, work ceased, at
the time of Johllnny's visit, at about two o'clock.
The rest of the day the negro had to himself-to
look after his own galden, to fish or hunt, or to
visit his neighbors, and chat, or do as he might
please.
24. Mr. WTyld also pointed out to Johnny the
great forests of magnolia, an(d long avenues of
live-oak trees, with the drlooping festoons of moss
that hung fi-om each branch.

THE CHAMOIS AND HER LITTLE ONES.
1. "What is a chamois?" asked little Arthur
Black of his father.
" It is a kind of deer, that lives like the goat,
on high, cold mountains.  But you do not pronounce it quite right. You must speak it as if it
were spelled shamrn-my."
2. "Will youplease tell me some stories about
the chamois?  Here is a picture of one in my
book, but it does not tell any stories about them."
3. "I  read once," said Mr. Black, "a story

A hunter one day spied one, with two little ones,
on the top of a high rock.
4. "The little chamois were leaping and sporlting by the side of their inother, and she, while
watching their play, was on the alert to see that
no one came near to hurt them.
5. "The hunter wished to catch one of the
little ones alive; and  so he, with  great care,
climbed over the r ocks until he got quite close to
them. But as soonl as the old chamois saw him,
she rushed at him in a fury.
6. " The hunterl beat her away with his gun,
and still went on, getting nearer the little ones.
When the old chamois saw she could iiot drive
off the hunter, nor push hiin over the rocks, she
was in a sad state of alarm.
7.  "She ran back to the kids, and showed
theon  how to leap'from their.rock, over a chasm,
on to another, roek; but they'were so young they
could not leap so far.
8. "In the:mean timie the hunter was creeping
closer, and would soon re-tch them.  At last; the

9. "W- hy, how cotld- she do that.". cried out
little Arthur.
10. "I will tell you," said M1l Black.  " She
stood up with her hind feet on the edge of the
chasm. and throwving her. fore feet to the other
edlge, formed a complete bridge across the) space.11. "As soon as the little ones saw this, they
seemed to know what it meant, for they sprang
up on her back, ran alonlg to her hlead, and leaped
safely off on the rock. In a few minutes they
had all got beyond the reach of the huntel."
12. " Well," said Arthur, "I think that was a
very smart chamnois; don't you, father?"
13. "I think it shows pretty clearly that animals know a great deal more than we are always
ready to admit they do."
LESSON LXX.'U
THE TOBACCO-PLANT.
--    i
1. Mr. Alden and hid son, Johlllly, after having
seen the rice plantations, left Charleston in the
cars, and went towards the north.
2. One  day, Mr. Alden said  to Johnny: "As
I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
v
mlyou have seen cotton, and sugar, and rice growing, how would you like to see tobacco 2"
3. Johnny said he would like it very well, but
that for his part he did not like tobacco.  "It
must be queer, though," said he, "to see it girowing.  Is it brown, just like a cigar2"
4. "Oh, no," said Mr. Alden. "It is green,
like all other plants. It turns brown after it is
dry.  We shall pass through Richmond on our
way home, and so we may as well stop and see
the tobacco-plant."
5. The next day they got to Richmond, and
the day after drove out to see a
tobacco plantation. They soon
came to one, with a good many
negroes in the field, hoeing the
plant.
6. A gentleman,who saw them,
took them  over the fields, and          M
showed them all there was to be
seen.  He told Johnny that the
seed was first sown in beds.
7. "Then," said he, "as soon
as the plant is big enough, it is taken up and set
out in the field. After this, we plough and hoe it,
until it is almost time to pick it."
8. Johnny was told, also, that a great g1en
worm got on the leaf and ate it, and that each
field had to be gone over by the negroes as often
as once a day.:9:Smetimes dozens of turkeys are let into
=.9 S f E.t X..0
0the fields. They eat the wollrm  eagerly, and soon
make way with a large nuimber.
10. Johnny and his father went over the plantation, and when they got back to Richmond,
they visited a tobacco warehouse.  Johnlny was
amazed to see stch piles of the tobacco leaf.
11. Mr. Alden then tojd him that tobacco is
called an Indian plant, because it was first used
by the Indians.
12. "When," said Mr. Alden, "some of the
men of Columlbus wvent ashore, they were astonishe(d to see the Indians with long reeds in their
mouths, and smoke coming fiom their mouths and
noses.
1'3. "That was the first that ever was seen of
tobacco by white men. Some of it was sent
abroad, and it soon came into use.
14. "It is said that Sir Walter Raleigh first
used it in England. A servant coming into the
room, and seeing him with smoke coming fiom
his mouth, and a light near his lips, thought he
was on fire, and in great haste threw a basin of
water over him to put it out."
15. Johnny laughed heartily over the story of
Sir Walter Raleigh, and wanted to know if it
was really true. His father told him he believed
it,was.

HORSES AND CHILDREN.
1. A man, who had a large family, owned a
horse, with which his children often played. So
used was the horse to the freaks and sports ot the
little ones, that he would on no account stir or
move when they were playing around his feet.
2. One day, when dragging a heavy load
through a narrow lane, a young child was playing
on the road, without heeding the approach of the
cart. In a moment more, it would have been

3. Finding the child did not move, he then
bent down, lifted the little one with great care
by the clothes with his teeth, carried it a few
yards, and laid it on a bank by the road-side.
4. As he moved on, he stepped very slowly,
and did not cease to look back at the child until
the whole of the cart had passed it, and the dangerl was over. This story is not unlike the one
that follows.
5. Some horses which were left to pasture in a
large field, broke down the fence, and found their
way into a lane. There they began to gallop at
full speed, to the great firight of some children
who were in the lane picking berries.
6. As the horses drew near, the children ran  
up on the bank at the side of. the lane to get out

ABOUT THE SENSE OF HIEAR(ING.
1. Mrs. Stewart called HIarry to her side, one
dlay, and( aske(d him if he had forgotten what she
had(l told lim about seeing and touching.  Harry
said that hle had not.
2. " Did you hear the soun(d of a giun, a little
while ago?"
"Yes,"  said. IIarry; " but it wa.s a great way
3. "That  is true," said MNrs. S'tewart; " but
there are othlter sounds near 1us.  We hear the I
soun(ls with our ears.  1he little openings at

Ideed, it is called the drum  of the ear. The eair
carries sound to the mind, as the eye carries pic,
tures to the mind. By this we know what is
spoken to us. We hear the soun(d of music, the
singing of birds, and the roar of the wind.
5. "Hearing often helps us to avoid dangel'.
A  nurse, with two children, was just going to
cross a stile. But she heard a fierce bull bellow
in the field; so she knew there was danger, and
she tuirned away.
6. " A coach -was going along very fast, and a
man was run over and killed. The poor man was
quite deaf, so he did not hear the sound of the
coach; and the night was too dark for him to see
it. It is by hearing that we learn what will make
us wise."
7. "Mamma, we learn a great deal when you
speak to us.  How  sorry we- should be, if rwe
cotld not hear you talk!"
8. "'It would, indeed, make us quite unhappy
if we could not hear each other. We like to
listen to kind, loving words. As old Aunt Susan,
who cannot read, is glad to hear little Patty read
to her fi.om the Holy Bible.
9. " Besides, if you could not hear-that is, if
you had been born deaf-you would not have
learned to speak. Those who do not hear at all,
are usually. dumb. How sad to be both deaf and
dumb!
10. "There are many poor children who never

t.and me toshut ouIr eyes, and guess what flower

4. "It would hbe a gireat loss to us if we had
not this sense. Flowers would lose half their
charms. They would still be very pretty to look
at, but would not be, sweet to smell.
5. " See, here is a pitcher of roses, pinks, violets, and some other sweet flowers. You have
smelt the magnolia and the orange blossom-how
sweet they are!
6. " The sense of smell is useful in helping us
to know or judge of, the nature of.things.  In
this way we may often know if they are good or
bad, and if proper for food or not.
7. "The power of smell helps, too, in time of
danger. It was thus I found out that the linen
in the kitchen had caught fire, and we ran to put
it out before much harm was done.
8. "There is also the sense of taste. Now here
is the apple again.  We can see it, feel it, smell
it, and taste it."
9. " Oh," said Harry, " I know the taste of an
apple! We taste it with our mouth."
10. "Yes, but chiefly with our tongues.  As
soon as any thing touches the tongue, we know if
it is sweet, oir bitter, or salt, or0 soul'.
11. "Sugar and honey are sweet, vinegar is

LESSON IXXIV:'W
ABOUT THE AIR WE BREATHE.
1. "Oh! imamma, howv I (lo love this nice walk
on the common!" said little Harry Stewart. "The
air blows all over my face. And look up, mamma:
some one has sent up a balloon. See how high
it is!"
2. " Yes, my dear, it is very nice to feel the air
refiresh us as we wallk. We seem  to breathe
more freely, and to gain in strength. The air is
all around us. We cannot see it, but we feel it.
Now look at the balloon. It moves very fast. It
is the wind that drives it along.
3. " Do you know what wind is? It is the air
moving fast.  When it moves very fast, it has
r.                                   a~~~~~~~immense power. You knowv how last year it
blew down the old oak-tree in our field."
4. "What is the use of air?" asked Harry.
"It has a great many uses," said Mrs. Stewart.
"The chief use is for us to breathe it.
5. " When we breathe, we draw in the air
through our mouth ancl nostrils, and it goes into [
our lungs, and mixes with the blood. It is not
all the air which'mixes with the blood.  Air is
made up of two parts.  One parit is mixed with
the blood when we breathe, and the other comes
back through the nose.
6. " If a man were shut up in a small room, in
which the doors and windows were so tight that
no air could get in, by and by he would use up all
the good part of the air; and then, if no more
fresh air were let in, he would die.
7. "People should always let fresh air into
their rooms, because it is hurtful to health to
breathe bad air. It makes us weak and sickly.
Beasts and birds need air, as we do.  If a mouse
or a biird were shut up in a box which had no
hole in it, it would die for want of air.
8. "Fishes breathe air through the water in
which they live. If we filled a box with water,
and put a fish in it, and then shut the lid very
close, it would die. You see my gold and silver
fish in the glass globe are not covered over.
9. "Plants must have air, too. But the air is
made up of three parlts, and the palrt of the air the
plants need is not the same that we need. The
3a0O  part of thle air which we need is called oxygenl,
and the part the plants need( is called car:bon.
10. "The air fills the sails of the ships and
mnakes thenm  move. It blows away the fog and
the damp.  When the air moves from  the south,
it is warim; and when it comes fi'oml the north, it
is cold.
11. "Do you see the sun?  The airl does not
extend all the way froml  the earth to the sun.
The air is only a few miles deep on the earth.
If you go up to the top of a high mountain, you
will find the air so thin, you can hardly breathe.
12. " And so it keeps getting thinner and thinner, until there is none at all."

THE BROTHERS.
1. " Let us go intoa the parlors, they are a great
deal larger," said Charlles to his brother.  " Come,
now, do.  We can play so much better there."
2. "I am afraid it would not be r ight," replied
Henry.  "We may break  somnething.  Mother
said that we had better never play there."
3. "But we will be so careful," said Charles,
who was quite a little boy.  "We Ican play cirI
11,53cus so nice.  I want to go into the parlor, so do
come."
4. Ilenry's father and  mother hlad gone out
to r ide, so he could not ask leave to play in the
parlor. He was almost sure it was wrlong to go
there, but he wanted to please his brother; so,
thinking he would be very careful, he went down
stairs into the parlors, with Charles on his back.
5. At first, he went slowly r ound the two
rooms; but Charles began to whip his horse, and
cry, "Get up, old boy: you are getting lazy.
You shall be a race-horse.  Now go fastelr, faster:
go round the room as fast as you can."
6. So round he went, faster and fasterl, shaking his head, and taking great jumlps, with Charles
holding on, laughing and screaming with delight,
till, alas!-sad to tell-his elbow brushed against
a vase, which  stood upon a little table, and
knocked it off, and broke it into a hundred'
pieces.
7. leniry stopped short, and let Charles slide
down firolm his back. He looked at the brokern
vase, and then at his brother; and Charles looked
at Henry, and then at the pieces on the floor.
8. "It is all broken," said he.  "It cannot be
mended at all: can it, brother?'"
"No, it is past nending," said Henry; "anid
the first thing we must do will be to tell mother."
9. " Oh, no!" said the little boy, " I ali afraid
to tell her."
"We must never be afraid to tell the truth,
153Cdear Charley.  I will set you a good example.
You shall never learn to tell a lie from me."
10. In, few mnoments the boys heard the wheels
of the carriage.  Henry went to the hall-door,
and opeued it. He held Charles by the hand.
He had to hold him pre tty tight, for Charles tried
to get away.
11. llis face was pale.  He waited until his
mother got out of the carriage, and came up the
steps, and then, takitng h&lt;old of her lantd, and
looking up in her face, he said, in a firm voice,
" Mother, I have broken' your vase."
12. " And 1, too," said the little boy; " and it
is broken all in pieces."  Their mnother kissed

TIlE DEER.
1. The deer that we hiave, in the picture on the
u next page is a male deer. The male deer has
plarge horns, called antlers. The female deer has
tno horns, and is calledI the doe.
2. The color of the deer is red.  It has large::r..
WI2. She lives with her aunt in an odd house,
near the edge of the woods. Do you see the
stone steps that lead up to it?
3. Rose can sing like a bird, and is at all
times full of mirth and glee. Her bright looks
and sweet smile make all glad to see and hear
her.
4. Her aunt is old and lame, but will come
out on the stone steps while Rose reads to her.
She loves Rose with all her heart, and thinks
her the best of girls.
5. Rose loves to walk in the woods, and hunt
for gay. moss and sweet flowers. When she
sings in the woods, the birds will sing too, as
if glad to hear her voice.
6. Would you like to live with Rose in this
odd house.? Would you like to sit with her
in the shade of the tree, and hear her read or
sing?
7. I think such a queer old house, with all
the trees and the birds, must be a fine place to
live in.
8. But one day, as Rose sat by the tree, she
had a great fright, which I will tell you of in
the next lesson.

3. Its speed is great; and, if it were not that
its strength soon gives out, nothing could overtake it.  The deer is found all over the world.
4. In the Southern States, it abounds in great
herds in the barrens  and swamps, where it is
hlunted with dogs.  Solmetimes it is hunted  at
ilight, by the hunter carrying a lighted torch in
hlis hand.
5. 1'he deer, attracted  by  the ligllt, comes
near it, or stands and watches its approach.  The
hunter sees the eyes of the deer shining in the
light, and fires at them.

tamed, if taken when very young and kindly
treated.  A young deer is called a fawn.
7. They are apt, however, to be full of mischief. A pair that were tamed and kept for
several years, were in the habit of leaping into
the house through the open windows.
8. Once when the sashes were closed, they
bounced through, breaking the panes of glass into
pieces.  No shlub or flower in the garden was
safe fiom  them, for they nibbled every thtng
within reach.
9. The food of the deer varies with the Season.
In spring and summer, they eat tendelr grasses.
In winter, they feed on the buds and sprigs of
shrubs.
10. Sometimes the deer leaps the fences and
visits the fields of the planter, taking a bite at
the young wheat or the corn. It has a liking for
cow-peas, and is fond of berries.
11. In autumn, it finds supplies of choice food
in the chestnut, the beech-nuts, and the acorns
strewed over the ground.  A herd of deer has
been seen feeding on these iiuts, with a flock of
wild turkeys around them.

BE POLITE.
1. It is said that George MecDuffie, of South
Carolina, was very polite, even when a little boy.
Onae evening he was holding a little calf by the
ears, while his mother milked the cow; and a
gentleman passing by, said, "Good-evening, my
little son."'2. George returned, "Good-evening, sil," with
such a polite bow, that the gentleman noticed
him, and said, " Why did you not pull off your
hat, my little firiend 2"
3. George aniswered, "If you will get down
and lold my calf for me, I will pull off my hlat
to yot."
4. Geolrge's politeness and shrewd remark were
the making of him. The gentleman said to hlis
nmother, 1" YoUr' son is a smart boy, and, if properly trained, will make a great man some day.
If you will permit me, I will give George a good
education, and give him a start in the world."
5. The mother thanked the gentleman for his
kindness, )nd let him take charge of her son.
George arose firom  the ears of his calf to the
highest rank in the legal profession. He w-as then
sent to the State Legislature; then to Congress;
then made Governor of Soutlh Carolina.
6. All little boys and girls should be polite.
Everybody likes polite children.  People will
speak well of children when they are polite and
158have good manners, and will have a good opinion
of their parents.  Be polite to the poor and
humble, as well as to the r-ich, to servants as well
as to their master*; and never fail to be polite
and attentive to old people.

LESSON LXXV4II.X;' ABOUT BOATS.
1. Tllere are a good many kinds of boatssome that move by sails, some by steam, and some
by oars. Some are built of wood, and some of
iron.
2. The largest vessels are ships; and these vary
a good deal in size.  A ship has three masts, and
carries square sails.  Do you know what I mean
by square sails?

the sails are square, and not like the sails on the

4. A brig has two masts, With squar e sails like
those of a ship.  A schooner hlas also two masts,
but the sails are very unlike those of a ship ori
brig.  They are like those in the vessels at the
righct of the picture.
5. Sloops have only one mast, witll sails like
those of the schooner.  A cutter is a small vessel
rigged like asloop, but built to go with greater
spee(l.
6. Besides these, there is the steamslhip, that
has masts, blut which is imoved mainly by steam;
and  the steamboat, whicll has no muasts or sails
at all.
7. The yacht is a pleasure sail-boat, rarely witll
mnore thall  one mast, but it varies in size.  Its
sails arc large, anll( it is built to go withl great
speed.
8. There are also a great number of small
boats, imoved by oars; and canal-boats, wvhich are
boats drawn alonlg a canal by horses; and then
there is the canoe of the Indian, madle of bark,
and so light that it can be easily carried  on
the shoulders.
9. So you see how many kinds of boats and
ships thelre are.  Some sail across the great ocean
to far-off lands.  Somne sail up and dow1 n our larlge
rivers; and others are only for the lakes and small
strenms.10. The steamboats on our great irivers are the
largest in the world; but the largest steamship
is the vessel called the Great Eastern, which call
carry ten thousand people.

so large had ever been built before.

LESSON,LXXVIII/.
WINTER AT THE NORTH.
1. In the Northern- States, the earth is covered
in the wintel-, more or less, with snow.  The boys
there do not mind the cold weather, being used
to it. They like to play and roll about in the
snow.
2. When the drifts are very deep, they get upon
the roof of a shed, and leap off into the snow, in
which they are almost buried.  This is excellent
sport, and makes their faces and fingers glow.When the snow is moist, the young rogues make
snowballs, with which they pelt Bach other merrily.
3. But their favorite amusement, when the
ground is covered with snow, is coasting, or sliding down hill on sleds. A long hill near a school0                                                  f~
161house,  at such a tilne, is a scene of boisterous
merriment and activity.
4. Snowv has many uses.  It is considered favorlable to winter grain to llave it coverled with
snow, and thus kept firom cold( air.  It is also useful in enabling the inhabitants to travel with ease
and speed.  Sleds, drawn by oxen or horses, are
used to carry heavy loads on the snow; they are
drawn much easier than carts on the bare ground.
5. Sleighs are used for carrying the people from
one place to another.  Whenl the snowr is well
beaten downl in the roa(l, the ihorises will tlravel with
a sleiglh milch fatster than with a coach or wagon.
In a covered sleigh, withl a buffalo-skin or a warlm
blanket wrapped around him, a person may ride
with comiifo rt in the coldest weather.
1;. In winter, the ponds, lakes, and rivers fireeze
quite hlard, annri  the b1oys amnuse themuselves by
slidinlg and skating on the ice. Somnetinies they
trnavel on their skates (vith a speed nearly equal
to that of a horse; somnetimles they cut circles on
the ice with the heels of their skates, flying and
turning with the grieatest swiftness.
7. Sometimes, too, an awkward lad gets a fall,
and strikes his head( on the hard ice; then, for a
momenit, he sees stars, as it we,re, for the blowv alImost breaks tlie skull.  Skaters, unless very expert, usually mleet with mLanly a fall, and often the

THE IIARMLESS CANNON.
1. During the War for Independence, in 1776,
the British had possession of several of the
Southern States. As our country was, at that
time, but thinly settled, the Americans were, for
a long time, unable to muster men enough to
drllive off the enemy.
2. But they did not give up in despair. No;
they contrivecl to annoy their foes whenever they
had a chance, and finally their' bravery and patriotism were rewarded with victory.
3. In this struggle. between our countryrmen
and great Britain, a great many interesting events
took place. I will relate one, which I think will
amuse you.
4. In the year, 1780, the British had a post at
Camden, in South Carolina. They had a sort of
163
Rfort there, and about one hundred soldiers to defend it.  These soldiers were under the command
of Colonel Rugely.,5. Colonel William Washington, a brave and
active American officer, resolved to take this fort.
But he had no callnon, and without one the fort
was safe enough from  all his efforts.  As there
was none to b4 had, the Americans deterlmined
to gain by stratagem what they could not by
force.
6. The commander sent some of his men into
the woods to cut a log from a pine-tree. This
log was hewn into the shape of a large cannon,
and painted, so that, at a distance, it looked more
like a lreal cannon than a harmless log of wood.
7. Having got this terrible field-piece all ready
for the attack, and so mounted that it appeared
as if it was just ready to give a salute which
would knock the forlt about the ears of its defenders, Colonel Washington called upon them to surrender.
8. Colonel Rugely was so terrified with the idea
of being attacked with so formidable a weapon,
that he was very glad to give up the fort, and
surrender himself, and all his men, prisoners of
war.
9. I-ow surprised he must have been, when he
found out he had been conquered by such an innocent field-piece! I do not doubt that he never
got completely over the vexation which the sight
of this pine.loy cannon must have occasioned him.

1. Bridges, you know, are built across rivers,
to enable passengerls to pass over them. There
are many bridges in different parts of our country,
and some of them  are very, large and beautiful.
Some are built of wood, and some of stone, and a
few have been built of iron, and supported by
huge chains.
2. The natural bridge, in Virginia, is called a
rock bridge, because it is composed of rocks.
The arch, or chasm under the bridge, through
which the water runs, is two hundred feet high.
The stream that runs under it is called Cedar
Creek.
3. If you were to stand on the top of it, and
look down, it would make you dizzy, and you
might fall qf, as it is said some persons have done.
When you stand at the bottom, by the little
river, and look up, it is a beautiful sight, and if
you should see it once, you would never forget it.
4. The rocks of which this bridge is composed
are soft limestone, which can be easily cut with a
knife, and visitors frequently cut their names upoIn
the rocks, to show that they have been there.
Some have climbed up, and cut their names quite
high, and others who have come after them, have
endeavored to cut their names still higher.
5. One young man, more daring than the others,
cut places in the rock for his hands and feet, and

ROSE ANTD THE SNAKE.
1. As Rose was one day sitting by the tree,
near the steps, with her book in her hand, her
cousin Joe all at once sprang firom  the steps
to her side.
2. IIe caught her by the arml, and cried out,
"Quick, Rose, quick!" and drew her away from
the tree as fast as he could.
3. "Look  there," said Joe; "look, Rose! a
viper was not more than three feet firom  you.
In one moment more it would have stung you."
4. Rose saw the snake, and grew deadly pale
with fright.  It was a kind  whose bite was
almost sure death.  Had it stuck its falngs in her
flesh, her gay songs would have bleen heard no
o11101e.
5. " Oh, Joe, let us go in," slie said.  "What
if it had( bit iie! I will not dare to colme to this
tree again."
6. "Tlhere it goes," cried Joe.  "Its hole is
under the steps.  We will have it out.  That is
too near homlle."
7. So Joe got a long bal, forcedl up the step,
andi tllele foun(d tllree of the snakes.  He soon.killed them with Ihis iron Iba'.
8. But Rose for a long tilune did not (lare to
sit onI the steps, or near the tree.  But as time
passed, and no more snakes were seen, she got
b}ack to her old ways again; and would  sit
13by that means climbed much higher than any one
llad ever been before, and thelre cut his name in
large letters, far above all others.
6. But he came near paying for his rashness
with his life; for he found it impossible to descend
by the same means.  And aftelr hanging in that
perilous condition for some time, he wa's at last
obliged to go upwards, cutting notelhes with his
knife, holding by one hall and cuttinrg with the
other, until he had climbed up the whole two hundred feet, notch by notch.
7. When near the top, his firiends let down a
grape-vine for a rope, and pulled him up.  He
was nearly exhausted with fatigue and firight, and
I have no doubt learned a lesson fiom it, which
he remnembered till the end of his life.

2. "Well, Imy child, as we go along, we will
speak of the clothes we wear.  The* stuffs of
which they are chiefly made are   tx and cotton,
which come fi'(om  plants; and wool and silk, wrhich
we get fiomn living, things.
3. " The little flax plant bears pretty blue
flowerls.  It grows in fields, and when pulled up
i by the roots, is spread out to dry.  Then after it
is washed aind, dressed, it is spuin iito yarn, and
the yarn is woven into linen cloth.
4. " Cotton, you iread about the other day.  It
is a soft, silky floss, which grlows in a lpod( on the
cotton-plant.  It is spun  into  thread, and the
thread is woven into cloth for our use in a good
mlany ways.

6. "In this state, the wool is called a fleece.
Before it can be used, it is washed, to make it
clean.  Then it is drawn over lar-ge iron comubs.
The spinner then takes it, and makes of it yarn

call silkworms. They spin little balls of silk,
which, after being wound, cleaned, and spun
again, art made into satin, broad silk, velvet,
crape, shrls, and ribbons.

FRANK'S LETTER TO JOHN.
1. Frank went to see a friend who lived near
the sea; and while there, he wrote a letter to
his play-mate, John:
DEAn JOIIN:
2. I like to be here. The house is not far
from the shore, and we have been down at the
beach three or foulr times.
3. When we were on the beach, the sea was
calm and smooth. There was not a wave to be
seen, nor a sound to be heard. The sun shone,
and the sky was bright and clear.
4. But at night the wind rose, and there was
a great storm. Next day, we were told a ship
had come on shore.
5. We all went down to the beach to see the
wreck. The sea was not like the same sea we
had seen the day before.
I
146. The waves were rough and high. The sky
was dark, and the wind was high and loud.
There were no ships nor boats in sight.
7. The wreck lay close to the shore. Masts
and spars, ropes and torn sails, casks and bales
of goods, were strewn on the sands.
8. The crew were safe.  The life-boat had
gone off in the night, and brought them safe on
shore. They went three times to the ship to
bring off the crew.
9. Were not the crew of the life-boat brave'
men? We saw them all, with the crew of the
ship, on the beach. The crew of the ship could
not thank the others enough for saving their
lives.
10. When it is clear, we are to go down to
the beach and search for shells. I do wish, dear
John, you were here. We would all have such
fun.
11. I want to have a sail out on the sea.
Papa says he will take me one of these days.
There is a nice boat here, with a mast and a
sail. Will not that be fine fun? Next time I
write I will tell you all about it.

TI-IE  SWAN.
1. FRANK.-Pa-pa tol(l me, to-day, the swan
had made a nest ill the reeds, by the side o(f the
lake.  He says she has laid four eggs, and she
sits on them, day an(l night, to keep thenl wa-llum.
And wllhat do you think, in six weeks a live
swan will come out of each egg!
2. RALPI.-Cani we go and feed the swan?
Let us get some breal, an(l take it down to the,
lake.  We then can see the swan in her nest..'
IIere is my cap.  Where is yours?
3. FIZANK.-I lhave got some bread.  JLet us
Iun down as fast as we can.  Take hold of imy,
hand, and be sure you do not all.
4. RALPI.--I can not take as long steps as,
you do.  Please do not run so fast. I am  all
gl: QIout of breath.  Oh, here is the I-lake! Do you
see the swan?
5. FRAN1K.-There she is, in her nest on the
left blank of the lake. I see her among the tall
reeds.  We must not go near her, for fear she
should hurt us.
6. RALPH.-Oh, I see her!  I see her long
neck.  What shall we do, if we must not go
near her?
7. FRnANK.-We can put the bread at the foot
of the old oak, and wait here by the elm. The
trunk of the tree hides us firom her; but we can
peep round and see her.  Keep still, now.
8. RALPH.-Look! n1ow  she turns her head.
I am sure she sees the bread. She lifts her long
neck; and now she moves. I see her rise firom
her nest.  Do you?
9. FRANK.-Yes, I can see her.  Here she
comes!  Wlhat large, black, web feet she has,
and how she rolls in her walk!  She looks best
when she swims.
10. RALPII.-NOW  she has got the bread.  It
does not take her long to eat it.  Let us come
each (lay, Fr'allk, and feed her.  Would you not
like to do so?

CAUGHT BY THE TIDE.
1. One day, Tom, and Kate, and John went
down to the sea-beach to sail their boat.
2. In one part of the sea was a reef that was
left dry when the tide was out. The end that
was far out in the sea was high, and the part
that was next the land was low.
3. When the tide rose, the sea came over the
part that was next to the land first, and cut off
the end out in the sea fromn the main land.
4. Tom  knew this, and had been told not to
stay out on the reef too long, for fear the tide
would come up, and he could not get back.

2__25. When they came to the reef, they found
the tide was low, so they all went on to the
rock. Here they sailed their boat, and looked
for shells and sea-weed. They all got so busy,
they did not think of the tide.
6. But the tide waits for no one. Up, and up,
and up it came, till the sea was all over the
lreef. At last Tom  said, "We must go home
now."  And then he saw it was too late.
7. Tom was a bold boy, and said, "Do not
cry, Kate. I will take you on my back, and
then come for John." So Kate got on his back,
and he went into the sea.
8. But he soon found it was too deep for him,
and he did not know what to do. He had to
wade back with Kate on his back, who now, in
great fright, cried loudly.
9. A man in a boat saw tnem, and came and
took them off the rock, and set them safe on the
shore. So they only got wet; but it was well
that the tide did not wash them all away.
LESSON VI.
THE BALL ANI) THE VASE.
1. Jane was at work, sewing, an(l Ralph ran
into the riooIm, to tell her whllat a nice, hard
ball he had.
2. JANE.--Yes, Ralph, it seems to be a good
ball. But you must not play with it in this
room, for fear you break the vase, or the glass.
193. RALPIT.-I do not mean to play with it
here, but I will just try it one bound.
4. JANE.--Pray, do not. I am afraid you will
hit the vase. There; you would not heed what
I said, and you have hit the vase.
5. RALPH.-There can be no harm done to it,
I am sure. It is quite whole still.
6. JANs.--There is harm done, for here is a
large crack in the vase; and you know how much
mamma thinks of this vase.
7. RALPII.-Oh, it is too. bad. I am sorry I
hit it. What shall I do?  Can we not mend
the clack?
8. JANE.-Go and tell mamma what you have
done. We can not niend it; and if we could,
we should tell mamma just the same.
9. RALPH.-I do not like to tell her; it will
vex her so. I wish you would tell her.
10. JANE.-No, Ralph; you must do it. You
have been in fault. To own a fault does not
make it worse;'but to hide what you have done,
will make it worse.
11. RALPIL--BUt still I do not like to tell
mamma. Do you think she will find it out?  
12. JANE.-If you do not tell her, some day
she will see the crack, and ask who did it. You
will tell helr, of couirse, that you did it. What
will she say, do you think?
13. RALPH.-I am sure I do not know. She
will say, " I wish you had not hit it."
I5
m
le
614. JANE.-No. She will say, "Why did you
not tell me at once?  I did not think you could
hide such  a  thing from  me.  Now, I cannot
trust you."  You will not like to hear mamma
say she cannot trust you.
15. RALPH.-I see you are right, Jane. I will
go to mamma at once, and tell her all about it.
16. Ralph went to his mother, and told her he
had broken the vase.  She said she was sorry the
vase was broken; but she was glad he was so
good a boy as to come and tell her of it.
17. Always tell when you have done anything
wrong.  No one likes little boys and gilMs who
hide whatt they have done. Tell the truth at all
times, boldly, and all will love you for it.

LESSON VII.
EXERCISE IN ARTICULATION.
The common habit of clipping the final g, in words ending in
iqng, can only be prevented by proper training. The following
sentences should be frequently repeated by the class, care being
taken that the articulation is rendered full and distinct. For
instance, raining, not rainin'.
It was clear at noon; but now it is raining.
Do you hear the wind, how it is blowing?
I cannot go; but John is going.
21Ile was more sinned against than sinningy.
The lesson can be learned by trying.
We bid them  good-by as they were leaving.
-How' high in air the bird is flying!
How  fast the corn is growing!

took his seat by the side of a fair girl.
7. If you stand here by the side of the hill,
you can hear the birds sing.

rough road.
9. He cut his hand with a pane of glass, and
the pain of the wound was severe.

WORK AND PLAY.
1. "Why does not Frank come out and play
with us." said Kate to Rose, as they went r unning down the lawn.
2. " H-e says he has not done his sum yet. He
could do it, I am sure, if he tried. Let us go
and ask him to make haste."
3. So Rose and Kate went to Friank, and found
him with his dog and slate. The dog was on his
hind legs, and Frank threw him a bit of cake to
catch, and then his ball.
4. " Oh, Firank," said Kate, " do not play with
your dog till your suIm is done. Do make haste,
and get your sum done, an(I then we can all lave
a play with Bob on the lawn.".5. "I cannot do my sum," said Frank, "till I
have had a game of play. A good romp with
Bob will clear Imny head."
6. KAT:E.-Why, you have but three lines to
add up. I am sure they might be soon done. If
you will put Bob out of the room, you can soon
get your sum done. Let Bob go with us.
7. FRAN.--No, 110o; I cannot let Bob go. He
must stay with me.  -Ie can stay here while I
add up these liines. Come, Bob, can you tell me
wlhat six andt four are?
8. KATE.-Oh, Frank, you cannot add up in
that way. You cannot work an(d play at the
~irsaime time.  Well, we w-ill go. When you get
your sumn done, you can join us.
9. Kate left Frank.  Now, thought Frank,
I will add up these three lines. But just as he
would get to work, Bob -would whine, or put his
nose in his lap, or do something to make Frank
look at him.
10. He would jump up with hisl paws on
Frank's knees, or stand on. his hind legs, orl baik;
and Frank could not keep his mnind on his suIIi.
At last, Kate came for him; but his sum was just
where it was before.
11. "Well," said Kate, "we aie going to the
Pine woods, and we shall have a nice play. Man.mma says you must not go till your sum is done."
12. Frank then sent Bob out of the room, aind
went hard to work at his sum. Now that Bob
was gone, it took him only a little while to do it.
He then caught up his cap, and ran to the Pine
woods, to find Kate and Rose.
13. It wvas some time before he could find them;
and when he did so, it was almost time for themn
to go home.  So Frank had but a short play. If
he had done his sum at first, he could have gone
with them, and had a good, long sport.
14. Always do the task you have to do at
once; and then, when it is done, you can play
with better heart.

EXERCISES IN EMPHASIS.
The drawling monotone common to young readers can be
corrected by repeated training in emphasis. A child will read; at a
uniformnn pitch,. "Did-he-go-to-the-house;" and it is important to teach him not only to lay stress on certain words in a
sentence, but how also to touch lightly and trippingly other words.
The change of meaning in a sentence, by shiftint the emphasis, will
be illustrated in a future lesson.
Is he a man or a boy?
Was it a cat I saw, or a dog?
Is John a good boy, or a bad one?
Did you see the hoor;se run?

It is not so easy to hide one's faults as to mend

ffLESSON XI. i
THE DOG AND THE SI-IADOW.
1. IDo you know the story of the dog and the
shadow?  It will teach you not to wish for what
you do not need, and shows what will result
from being too greedy.
2. A  dog, with a large piece of meat in his
mouth, was on his way home. He had to cross a
small stream, on a plank bridge.
3. WVhen he got to the bridge, he saw in the
clear water of the brook the shadow of himself
and the meat. This he thought was another dog,
with another piece of melt.
4. Now, not willing to keep his own meat, and
let the other dog have his, he made a snatch at
the piece which he thought he saw.
5. But so far from  getting the ond piece r
i
27which his greed made him  want, that which he
held in his mouth dropped into the brook, and
was lost.
LESSON XII.
THE STORY OF COLUMBUS.
1. An old man came back to his home, which
he had left for many years.  His fi'iends came
round him, asking him where he had been, and
what he had seen; and this was one of the tales
he told them:
2. "I left the shore of the isle which had been
my home. With a pang of grief I cast back a
long, sad look on the fair land of my birth.
3. "The soft breeze curled the blue sea, and
the bright sunlight played upon the deep.  Our
ships, with their sails swelling in the breeze, cut
through the waves, and bore us over the sea.
4. " Day by day the wind blew firom the east,
and we held our way right on to the west, where
the sun sets.  Our hearts were full of hope, and
we blessed the breeze that did not change.
5. "We were bound to the west,- where we
lhoped to find a New World. On we sped.  One
week was gone, and still the wind blew strong
fiom the east. Two weeks passed, and still we
held on our course. Afll was sea, look which way
we would.
6. "At morn, at noon, at eve, we climbed the
xmast to look for land. But in vain.  No sholre:x             0-*                      --S                   iTHIRD READER.                 29
was to be seen. The fourth week passed, and
still all was sea.
7. "Ourr men, once so full of hope, once so
bold, grew sad and full of fears.  They spoke of
home, of their firiends, and asked when they
should see them again.
8. "One night, thick clouds hung over the
sea, the wind came in gusts, the waves rose, and
a fierce storm burst upon us. For three days and
nights we drove before the storm, and then the
rain fell, and the wirld ceased.
9. "But still no land. The men looked gloomy
and sad. They would work the ship no longer,
and said that we must give up the search for a
New World, and go back to our own shores.
10. "Yet how were we to do this?  The wind
still blew from the east, and bore us on to the
west."
LESSON XIII. i/
THE STORY OF COLUMBUS.
(Continued.)
1. "All at once I heard a shout, and one of our
men pointed to a bird flying slowly overead.i
I never had seen so sweet a sight; for I knew
that the bird must have come from.land, which
could not be far distangt.
2. "Still, three days passed, and we saw  no
land.  But there were now many sig:itweeds floated on the waves, and. bi:were  n:the wing.3. "That night we stood on the deck, and
watched till the dawnl, when, like a cloud on the
edge of the sea, we saw a long, gray line of coast.
With what cheers and shouts that sight was
glreeted!
4. " We left the ship in our boats; and, lrowing through the calm waves, we leaped on shore,
and, kneeling down, kissed the earth. We prayed,
and wept our thanks to God.
5. " Hard by the spot where we left our boats,
a brook was flowing. I stooped down andu drank,
and never did I taste so sweet a dlraught.
6. "The men who dwelt in the New World
soon came round us.  Their skins weie dark.
They had spears and bows in their hands; and
at filst they looked at us as if they thought we
were their foes.
7. " But when they found we did not mean to
hurt or wrong them, their looks grew calm and
mild, and they led us to a large hut, not far
from the beach, which they gave us as our house
for the night.
8. " The,roof and walls of the hut were built
of boughs, and canes, and trunks of trees. Nets
made of reeds hung from  the walls and Ioof.
We lay down in these nets, and slept through
the night in peace."

THE LION AND THE MOUSE.
1. Do you know what a fable is?  A fable is
a story which'is not true, and yet it teaches us
a truth. Do you want to know how that can
be?  Listen, then, to the fable of the lion and
the mouse.
2. A lion, tired anid faint with heat, lay down
in the shade of an. oak, to take his repose. While
he slept, some mice ran overl his back, and iwaked
him. He started up in a rage, and clapping hlis
paw  on one of them, was about to put it to
death.
3. But the mouse pleaded for his life. " Why
should you kill," said he, " so small a beast as I
am, who have not the power to do you harm?
Make war on those who are worthy youil fame
and strength."
0  ~     ~: V~:  ~..  X..-    f   *  a
324. The lion heard the mouse, and, lifting his
paw, bade him go. "You are, indeed," said he,
" beneath my rage. A lion should not stoop to
notice so small a beast;" and with this he let the
mouse go free.
5. Some time after this, the lion fell into a toil
of ropes, set to trap him. With all his great
strength he could not tfiee himself; and he set
up a loud roar of rage and pain. The mouse
heard him, and ra to his side.
6. "Fear not,",said the mouse, "for:I am your
firiend. I will show you that even so small a
beast as I am, can be of use to as great a beast
as you are."
7. With that the mouse set to work, and with
his small, sharp teeth began to gnaw the ropes.
In a short time he had parted them, and the lion
was set free.
8. This is the fable of the lion and the mouse.
Can you see the truth it teaches?-that nothing
should be beneath our notice, as nothing can be
too small to be of use in time of need.

THE SAIL.
1. Frank told John in his first letter that he
would write to him again, and tell him about the
sail he was to have. Here is his letter.
DEAR JOHN:
2. We have had the sail I told you about. It
was a fine day. The sun was bright, and the
wind brisk.
3. Two boatmen went with us. My cousins
Harry and James, Papa, and myself made up the
party.   e took lunch with us. We had fishing
lines also, and two trolling lines.
4. Do you know what trolling is?  I will tell
you. A long line, with a hook, to which something bright is made fast (a silver spoon will do),
is thrown from the stern of the boat.
5. Then, as the boat sails, the line is drawn
through the water. The bright thing looks like
a small fish, and the big fish dart at it, and swallow it. Then'they are caught on the hook, of
course, and are pulled into the boat.
6. We caught one big blue-fish to-day. It,
was grand sport, I tell you. Then we sailed
away to a point of land that put out a long way
into the sea. Here, near this point, we let go
our anchor.
7. Then we got out our lines, and began too
fish. I caught four fish, Harry six, and James
0~~~~~~~~~~five. Papa caught ten. It' was fine full. We
got in the small boat, and went ashore. The
land was all sand, and stones, and sea-grass.
8. When we got back, we had lunch.  I never
was so hungry in my life. After lunch, wve got
up our anchor, and started for home. The wind
was now quite brisk, and the waves high.
9. It was sport to see the spray dash over the
bow of the boat. And how fast we did go!
The wind got so high, the men had to take a reef
in the sail; but I did not care how fast we went.
10. We all got safe home, at last; but the
waves ran so high, it was hard work to land us.
I did not care.  I should like to be out  sea in
a grand storm.  Would you?
11. I hope we can go again. I should like to
live near the sea, and have a filue big boat, and
sail all the time.
12. Harry is going to have a boat his next
birth-day; and, just as soon as he can learn to
sail it, he Ineans to go out with it alone. I do
think that would be splendid.
Your friend,
FRANK.
13. P. S.-We are going to sail again the day
after the next. Papa says we can troll for blue.
fish, and that I can have a line all to myself. I
do wish, John, you were here to go with us.

THE OTTER.
1. IHave you ever seen  the otter?  -Ie isI
foiiiid on the banks of rivers, and can swim ll ke
aL fish.  His lmotions ill the water are said to
1: e veiry rapid ailnd beautiful.
2. He feeds on fisli, whieh lie dives after; and
so swift arle Ihis lmotions tllat few can eludet hlil.
To see him darit about unclelr the current--now
h1ere, now there, shooting off like an aIr'ow afterl
a fish, then darting back again--is a finle sighllt.
3. TIe is hunted with dogs; but he takes to
the water to escape them, divilng under the surface, and staying there a long timle.  Sometimes
he will pull a dog down with him.
4. It is said he will at times drive a whole
shoal of fish beffore him, until filnding they cannot
escape himn, they will thlow  themselves out of
B  the wateir upon the shore.  lie takes the fish he
has caught on shore, and eats it head first, downward to the tail.
5. Otters have a strange sport. They will go
to the top of a bank of snow, if in winter, or of
clay, if inl summer, and slide head first to the
bottoml.  If they slide into the river, as is often
the case, they swim back to the shole, and make
haste to repeat the feat, and seem  to think it.great fuin.
5. It is said, otters can be tamed, and taught
to catcll and bhring home fisl.  What boy would
not like to have a talme otter, which he might
teach to fetchl and carry, tile same as a dog does?
7. It would be o(id, indeed, to walk along the
bank of a stream with an otter at -our heels,
which  would, now  and tlhen, plunge into the
stream, and bring out a big fish and lay it at our
feet!
8. When we wanted a dinner, we would only
have to call oul otter, start for a walk along the
rivelr-side, and we should soon have fish enough
for a meal, without any labor on ouI' part.

THE POOR WIDOW.
1. I knew a widow very poor,
Who four small children had;
The oldest was but six years old,
A gentle, modest lad.
2. And very hard this widow toiled,
To feed her children four;
A noble heart the mother had,
Though she was very poor.
3. To labor she would leave her home,
For children must be fed;
And glad was she when she could buy
A shilling's worth of bread.
4. And this was all the children had,
On any day to eat;
They drank of water, ate their bread,
But never tasted meat.
5. One day, when snow was falling fast,
And piercing was the air,
I thought that I would go and see
How these poor children were.
6. Ere long I reached their cheerless home--'Twas searched by every breeze;
When going in, the eldest child
I saw upon his knees.7. I paused to listen to the boy;
He never raised his head,
But still went on, and s.aid, " Give us
This day our daily bread."
8. I waited till the child was done,
Still listening as he prayed;
And when he rose, I asked him why
That prayel' he then had said.
9. "Why, sir," said he, " this morning when
My mother went away,
She wept, because, she said, she had
No bread for us to-day.
10. "She said, we children now must starve,
Our father being dead!
And then I told her not to cry,
For I could get some bread.
11. "Our Father, sir, the prayer begins;
Which made me think that He,
As we have no kind father here,
Would our kind father be.
12. " And then you know, sir, that the prayer
Asks God for bread each day!
So in the corner, sir, I went;
And that's what made me pray."
13. I quickly left that wretched room,
And went with fleeting feet,And very soon was back again
With bread enough to eat.
14. "I thought God heard me," said the boy:
I answered with a nod;
I could not speak, but much I thought
Of that boy's faith in God.

THE CROW AND THE PITCHER.
1. A cr'ow, ready to die with thirst, flew with
joy to a pitchel' which he saw at some distaiice.
When he came, he found water in it indeed, lbut
it was so near the bottom, that, strain as he would,
he could not lreach it.
2. Then he tried to upset the pitcher, and( so
get at the water that way. But he was not
strlolig enough fori this, and the water was still
out of his reach.
3. But some pebbles lay near the place.  These
lhe took one by one and cast into the pitcher;
and as the pebbles fell to the bottomi and slowly
filled the pitcher, the water rose to the top.
4. By this means the crow was able to get a
draught of the water he so much, needed; andwhen he had drunk enouglh, he flew off in search
of food.
5. This fable teaches us what may be done
when we set oui' wits fully to work. If one plan
will not bring about the end we wish, some other
plan, perhaps, may. If at first we do not succeed, why, let us try again.  And let us not only
tr'y, but tltink. Let us never, when we have a
task to do, forget the fable of the crow and the
pitcher.

THE LOST CHILD.
1. A man went out one day to cut wood on
the edge of a forest. It was a lonely spot, and
he took his son with him, a child about five years
old.
2. While he was at work, the child was at
play, trlying to catch a young kid, which was feeding on the hill. The kid ran about, now here,
now there-jumping over a piece of rock, skipping over a heap of stones, running up and down,
with the child in full chase after him.
3. The man saw that the child was pleased,
and went on with his wo'rk. But when, after atime, he looked up again, he could see nothing of
the child.  Fearing  he might wander off too far,
he left his worlk to look for him.
4. To his surprlise, he could see no trace of him.
He called "Davie! Davie!" in vain. HIe heard
no sound but that of his own voice. He still
kept up the searlch, and at length came upon the
child's footsteps in a soft, marshy part of the
hill-side.
5..Beyond this marsh ran a stone wall, over
which the father thought the child could not
climb.  At the foot of the hill lran a small
stream, and it was clear he could not have gone
that way..6. The father xwent homue, but no one there had
healrd of the child. Firiends camle, and, with the
mother, they all set out in search of the lost one.
They came back to the hill; and, on crossing the
stone wall, they found traces of the child's feet.
7. They traced the footsteps all the way down
the hill to the brink of the stream, and then all
signs of the child were lost.
8. "Poor child, poor Davie! lhe has fallen into
the strleam!" clried the mother. " le is drowned!
My dear boy is drowned 1" and the woman wept
and wrung her hands.
9. " Keep up your heart, wife," said the father;
"he may be safe. We will not give him up yet."
They kept along the bank of the stream, and
soon found a sumall bit of the child's dress, which
had been torn off.

THE LOST CHILD.
(Contirnued.)
1. Night was now coming on fast. The moon
showed some light, but the clouds were thick and
black. They had now gone on for miles, and all
began to think it useless to purlsue the search.
The stream, too, was wider and deeper; and that
he had fallen in and been drowned, seemed but
too likely.
2. Just as some of tllem stopped, saying it was
no use to go on, a man who had gone on before,
cried out, " Here's the boy's hat in the stream!
Don't give up now!"
3. " Oh, he is drowned!" cried out the mother,
afresh. The father, too, now thought they should
never find the child alive, and all went on grave
and full of fear.
4. " Look! look!" clried out one who was ahead.
"I think I see something on the edge of the
stream, among the rocks.  Do you see? What is
it?" "It is the child," cried the father, who had
runl up.
5. And there, indeed, was the boy on the
bank, half-sitting, half-lying, with his feet in the
stream, and his head on a stone, sound asleep.
The mother and father could not speak for joy.
6. When they woke him, the child raised his
head fiom the stone, and said, " Oh, father! why
did you not come to help me to catch the kid?"'

LESSON XXIV.7?
THE WILD-CAT.
1. The wild-cat is very like our common cat,
only it is wild and fierce. It lives in the woods,
and feeds upon birds and rabbits.
2. The one in the picture here has a rabbit
u under its paw. It is growling at some one ori
something as if it feared it would lose its prey.3. The wild-cat hides among the thick leaves
and branches of trees; and when a poor bird or
rabbit comes within its reach, it springs upon it
in an instant.
4. The wild-cat in the picture is a great deal
like the common cat. The panther is a kind of
wild-cat, only much larger.
5. Do you know that the tiger is nothing more
than a very big cat? It has claws like a cat,
teeth like a cat, and it nmoves and springs like
a cat.
6. Good, gentle puss, whichl you hold in your
lap, and smooth, and play with, if left to run in
the woods, would soon get wild.
7. But she would not get so wild as the cat
found in the woods, that never had any one to
pet or make nmuch of it. Puss would soon get
tame again, if brought into the house; but not
so the real wild-cat.

HOLIDAYS AT THE PLANTATION.
1. The spring holidays had arrived, and George
and Clara were wild with joy at the idea of going
into the country.
2. They bade all the town servants good-by..........  
4,[48        SOUTIIER-N  PICTORIAL
George mounted his pony, calling his dlog Fido
to follow him, and Clara sprang illto the carriage
with her parents, thinking she could ride forever
without being tired.
3. It was a bright April morning. The sun
shone, the birds sang, an(l the flowers smelt
sweetly.  Clara was full of delight for about ten
miles, and then she grew weary.
4. Her mother told her to sing some hymin- atnd
songs.  So Clalra sang, and George, riding i up to
the side of the carriage, sang too, and  this
amusement kept them  firom  thinkiing of their
fatigue.
5. At one o'clock they stoppedc on the road%side to rest the horses and dine. This is called
a maroon.  The servants spread a small carpet
on the grass, under a lartge oak, hung all about  
witlh gireen vines, and gray, moss-like fringe.
6. The children aided in taking the cold ham
an(l fuel fi'rn the basket.  At last they sat down
to eat; and George and Clara thought nothing
had ever tasted so good as the cold lunch on the
glrass.
7. "Mamma," said Clara, "I think this is as:
pretty as our dining-room.  The oak branchesi
ar1e our' culrtains, the sky is our ceiling, and the  
birds are ourl musicians."
8;  "Hush!" said Geo rge; " see the rabbit crloss-  
ing the road! Quick, Jack, with my gun. Look!
the, fellow is on the fence; now he is on the gumntree!"  
a.,    X fj  A,:f. ~~~9. Thle gun was TS   rotuoht.  Georcge fired, and(
1missed his aim, and the merry party latughed at
him.
10. " Nevelr minld," saidil George, " yon shall see
what I can do whlen I get to OOak Hall.  A fellow's hand shalkes a little after riding.  I won't
often miss then, I can tell you."
11. When the servants had dined, they all set
Qof; quite refireshed. Clara wTas alnmost asleep
when, at twilight, they entered the avenue leadingup to Oak HaIll; but was soon aroused by the
brigllt glare of the bush-lights kindlled about the
neg ro-hlouses.
12. Th1ese lights threw a bright light ovei the
Hall, andt all the houses andl trees.  The way
they arie arranged is this: A  carlpenter drlives a
stake into the grouind quite deep, and fastens an
open wooden box on the top of the stake.
13. This box he fills with earth.  When night
comes Wn, the negroes lay a small heap of pine
sticks on the earth in the box, and set fire to
them, addin&lt;g others as these burn out.
14. "TIere we are!" shouted Clara.  "Look,
George, there is the tree where you shot the
pretty bluebird.  Don't shoot any more pretty
birds, will you?  I cannot beair to see the dear
little things shot."
15. A turin in the road now brought theln near
to Oak Hall.  A  large number of negroes were
waiting their arrival, and the little, ones came
leaping and skipping about the bush-lights like
0~~~~~~~ 0so many monkeys.  George  and  Clara found
their aunt in the house ready to welcome them.

HOLIDAYS AT THE PLANTATION.
(Continued.)
1. A light shower fell in the night, and when
the children arose in the morning, the trees,
bushes, and flowers looked bright and beautiful.
2. George and his cousin James called Clara to
help them to get ready to go out gunning. Clara
stitched up two odd-looking things, which she
called hunting-caps, and James and George put
on their jackets wrong side out.  They looked
like two Robinson Crusoes.
3. They came home in three hours, with one
little kingfisher, and asked Clara and her cousin
Jane to go with them in the fields and cook it.
4. They took salt and rice, and a saucepan to
cook it in.  When they reached the field, they
found a large oak-tree, quite hollow in the trunk.
There were ashes inside, where the field-negroes
had been cooking.
5. They gathered some dry brush, and soon
a,2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~l
0I., ITH IRD READE R.                 51
had a fire burning on the old ashes. They now
p'cked the bird, and put it in the saucepan. They
got water firom a spring; but they forgot a spoon,
and bad to whittle a stick to eat with.
6. A gust of wind blew the dust an(l ashes into
their eyes, and they had many other troubles;
but they turned them all into fun. After a while,
the bird and rice were cookedl, and they all said
they had never eaten any thing that tasted so
good.
7. Ori a cluster of large oaks, near the house,
ran an immense grape-vine. It wound up the
limbs of one tree, then droppedl down fiom  a
vast height near to the ground, and then threw
up its tendrlils to another.
S. This was the children's favorite swing, and
here George and Clara, with their cousins, and a
troop of little negroes, would often go and swing.
They would always give the little negroes a turn,
who enjoyed it greatly.
9. One night they asked leave to go to the
firog-pond, and have a fiog-concert.  So their
father, and mother, 1and aunt, and( cousins, anld a
whlole party of negroes, went for' the frog-concert.
10. When they got there, George arranged the
whole party. F.ather and the boys, and the elder

with theiI joyous songs.
13. So, what with songs and the swing, riding
on the ponies, long drives in the' carriage, walks
in the woods, and romps in the fields, the children
had great sport.
14. But at last, the time came for theim to return' to school. It seemed sad to leave the beautiful country, with its wide fields and green trees,
for the dusty city. But they found pleasure in
thinking of the time

they looked so gay and beautiful, that you might
j think they had some right -to be proud indeed.

Ei22. Near them  glew the poor little Snow-drop,
who could hardly show the least sprig of green; i
but who cried out to them, "Have you not one i
kind word for a poor little Snow-drop, who is
buried helre in the ground?"
3. But the Rose and the Lily took no notice
of such a mite of a thing. They were too proud
of their bright colors and sweet odors, to heed a
small, paltry Snow-drop.
4. But soon the cold north winds came, and
brought troubles with them. The Rose began to
fade and.droop; its gay blossoms fell to the
glound, and its green leaves were swept away by
the fierce wind.
5. And so (lid the Lily fade and droop too.
But the little Snow-drop, down in its warm bed
of earth, was not hurt by the cold winds; and
now both the Rose and the Lily wished that they,
too, like the Slnow-drop, had a safe, warm place to I
hide in.
6. Then came winter. The Lily was broken
down and killed by the wild winds.  The Rose
was torn and beaten, until only thorns and briers  
were left.  And in this way the proud summer
blossoms carne to their end.
7. And now came peeping up above the ground
the little, bright Snow-dirop, with its green leaves
and its white blossom.  Every one was glad, to
see it, and all were foild of it.
8. It was loved and petted for the sweet pa-Fl
tience with which it had borne all the slight and
t05.f fE    gs^ Xscorn of the Rose and the Lily, and all the storms
and the cold of winter.
And to see its green leaves peeping up, with
the good news that spring would soon be here
again, and that all the flowers would bloom once
more, made all welcome it with delight.
10. So do not let us forget the Snow-drop.
And if we are ever so rich and fine, like the Rose
and Lily, let us not be proud, and hold our heads
above others, who may be even more worthy
than we of love and esteem.

ITEE undersigned have now ready a series of Southern Readers, designed for Schools and Families, and prepared under the sanction and
supervision of eminent friends of education in the South. The series
consists of seven volumes, as follows:
THE SOUTHERN PICTORIAL PRIMER, OR FIRST READER.
THE SOUTHERN ELEMENTARY SPELLER.
THE SOUTHERN PICTORIAL SECOND READER.
THE SOUTHERN PICTORIAL THIRD READER.
THE SOUTHERN PICTORIAL FOURTH READER.
THE SOUTHERN FIFTH READER.
THE SOUTHERN SCHOOL SPEAKER.
In all particulars the Readers of this series are as full, complete,
properly graduated, and, in pictorial and mechanical features, as
attractive as any before the public. The subjects have been selected
with a view to please the fancy and excite the interest of the child;
and at the same time to illustrate the leading characteristics of
Southern life and history. The lessons have been arrang,ed so as to
lead the pupil on, step by step, in easy gradations; and a method has
been adopted which will insure the thorough training of the pupil in
the correct principles of articulation, pronunciation, emphasis, inflection, etc., while the worse than useless encumbrance of formal rules
in the primary books-rules that the child cannot possibly comprehend, and which are, therefore, really a hindrance-has been carefully avoided.
The volumes are beautifully illustrated, printed on superior paper,
in good type, and tastefully bound. No pains or expenses have been
spared to make the series in every respect pleasing to Southern
families and schools, and worthy of their patronage. It will be distinctively their series.

HARRY AN1D JAM.ES.
1. IIrlry anmd James lived nearl the set.shoIre.
Tlere was a little inlet (,f the Sea where they' went to play on the beach, antd to lhunt for shells,
cclabs, and clamrs.
2. The wazterl in tlhis inlet wais not deep, except
Vwh1en the tide was lliihl.  Whllen tle tide wa;s  j
low, it was only up to their kllees.  Tlle bottom
~was of Sliloothl san1d.
3. Now  Itlar1ry and  James mla:de little, pla)y-  
bloats, whichl they wvotild take do,wn to tlhe -ach, t:anld sail on tile iiilet.  But they did not knoNw
how  to  lmakle boats w-ith  keel and  bowr, and1
1shaped just like real boats.
0 --____      ____   _  ___-_. -, -,- -    _  4. Soimetimtes the boats they made would not
stand up in the water, but would turn over as
fast as they were set up. Now old Tom, who
lived near the beach, and had once been a sailor,
saw them trying to sail their boat one day, andl
told them he would make them a boat.
5. They were glad of this. They had often
gone to old Tom's cabin, and heard him  tell
stories of his life on the sea-of the far-off places
he had seen, and the great storms and dangers
he had been in.
6. So Tomn began to make them each a boat.
He carved them out of blocks of wood, as trim
and neat as could be. Then he made masts, vwith
spars and ropes, an(l fitted little sails to them.
7. So that when the boats were done, they
looked just like real brigs. A brig, you know,
is a vessel with two miasts. Harry and James
danced and jumped for joy, and thanked old
Tom over and over again.
8. Then down they went to the beach, old
Tom with them. The tide was low; so they
pulled off their shoes, rolled up their trowsers,'~
and waded into the water with their boats.
9. Wlhat shouting and clapping of hands there
was when they saw their boats sail off so finely!
They moved as steadily as a big ship. The boys
thought they never had known such fine sport as
sailing their boats.  Old Tom was glad, too-it
made him happy to see them enjoy it so.
10. Harry and James did not forget, to be kind

jack-knife.  James took hirm  a large basket of
fruit.  Old Tom  told them that when they got
to be big boys, he would build them a boat large
enough for them to sail in, which made them take
off their hats and cry, " Hurrah for old Tom!"

J,ESSON XXX. --
BOZ AND PUSS.
1. Our old cat, which has had six kittens, knows
a gi-eat deal. Though  she does not know as
much as our dog Boz, yet there is one thing in
which she shows mnore sense and skill than we
should think a cat would have.
2. What do you think she can do mole than
Boz? She can open a door. We have had cats
and kittens of all sorts, but she is the only'one
that cotuld open a door.
3. When the kittens want to go out, they
mlew and mnew at the door, till some one lets them
out. When Boz wants to go out, he will bark,
or whine, or scratch at the dooi, till some one
comes to open it.
a~:m
5s4. Not so our cat.  The door that leads into
the yard has a latch.  When she wants to go
into the yard, how do you think she can lift up
that latch?  It must be full three feet firom the
floor. I will tell you.
5. Thele is a piece of the latch we put our
thumbs on, when we want to lift up the latch.
Puss springs up from the floor, puts her paw on
this thumb-piece, her weight makes the latch
come up, the door opens, and out she walks.
6. Thanks to no one, she helps herself. But
she cannot shut the door.  She leaves that part
for some one else to do for her.
7. But if little Mary should fall into the water,
which could pull her out, Boz or Puss?  Boz i~
the one that could swim  in after her, catch hold
of her clothes, and bring her on shore.
8. As foi Puss, if she saw Mary in the water,
she would not know what it meant; and if Malry
were drowned, Puss would not care, nor would
she miss her.
9. Though cats have some love for those who
are kind to them, and feed them well, yet they
love their old homes more.
10. A cat likes the barn she finds mice in, the
fireplace that warms her, the spot on the rug
where the sun shines, the room in which the old
clock goes tick, tick, while she lifts her eyes, half-shut, and looks up at it.
11. If all the folks in the house should leave.
Puss would not care or seek for them. Ift ier
[]: X:   barn, and chair, and rug, and ru, and fle were left, she
would not imew for one of them.
12. But what would Boz do?  He would not
stay one day ill the house if those he loves were
gone. He would r,un till he found them; and he
would raise a great cry if he did not find them.
13. He does not care where he lives or sleeps,
if those he loves are with himu.  He would leave
the warm fire, and go and lie on the cold ground,
to be with the friends he loves.
14. Which would you think most of, Boz or
Puss? But Puss loves to lie in your lap, and to
have you smooth her; and will bring her kittens
to you, for you to love and pet them.
15. If Puss is your pet, you must be kind to
her, arid feed her, and take good care of her.
And if you have a dog for a pet, you must also
be good and kind to him.

LESSON XXXI. 2  
MARY'S PRAYER.
1. Once when Mary had been told of her faults
by her motherl, she got very cross and angry.
When at night she came to say her prayers,
she did not ask God to bless her mothelr, as she
was in the habit of doing, but only said, "God
bless father I",L,1.  
602. Her mlother heard the prayelr, but took no
notice of it at the time; and Mary went to bed
without asking for her good-night kiss.
3. She lay awake for a long time. At last,
she was heard to say, " Mamma, will you live a
great while 2"
4. "I do not know," said the mother. "' I may
live'only a few  days, and I may live many
years."
5. "Do you think you shall die soon?" asked
Mary.
" I cannot tell."
6. "Do many mothers die, and leave their clildren?"
"Yes, my child, a great many."
T. "Mammia," said Mary, "I want to say my
players over again;" and getting up in bed, and
clasping her little hands, she said, " God bless
father, and my dear, kind mother."
8. Wbhen Mary thought that her mother might
die soon, she forgot her anger, and could not be
half kind enough to her.  But she ought to have
known, that no mlatter whether her mother should
die soon or not, it was her duty always to love
and honor her.

THE SlHETLAND PONY.
1. 011 H-arry Bell's tenrth  birth-day, his father
gave him a little Shetland pony.
2. Shetlaind ponies comle firom  the north of
Scotland.  They are small, but very strong for
their size.  They run  almost wild  among, the
hills in Scotland, and will climb up steep places
just like a goat.
3. Iarty, of course, was very fond of his pony,
and told his father he wrould be very kind to it,
and take the best care of it.
4. The father got a small saddle and bridle
made for the pony, and then IIarry rode it all
about. He wvould ri(le it illto town to the postI_

father.
5. Harry was a good-hearted boy, and so he
let his cousin John and cousin Lucy r ide the pony
sometimes. There was no side-saddle for Lucy,
so she rode without a saddle, holding fast to the
mane.
6. Now Harry had a little, white dog that he
kept in the stable with the pony, and when Harry
went to i-ide, his dog went with him, running
along by his side.
7. The pony and the dog got to like each other
very much. The pony would neigh when he
would see the dog, and the dog would bark, as if
it would  speak and  say, "How  do you do,
Pony?"
8. One day as Hairry was riding the pony,
with the dog at his side, a big, crloss mastiff,
that was owned by one of the neighbors, rushed
out at the little dog, and seized it fiercely by the
throat.
9. Before Harry could jump from his saddle,
and rescue his dog, the pony made a dash at the
mastiff, and rearing up, struck him so hard with
his fore-feet, that the mastiff was glad to scamper
off at full speed.
10. Harry often rode by the cross mastiff after
that, but it took very good care to keep a safe distance from  the pony and his friend, the little,
white dog.
11. Harry was now more fond than ever of his

found, it is believed, acceptable to Southern parents
and teachers.
Great pains have been taken to render the subjectmatter varied and attractive; and the lessons have
been so arranged that the pupil can advance by easy
and steady gradations.
Instead of grouping a few lessons and exercises in
articulation and pronunciation, in the opening pages
of the book, exercises in these and kindred points
have been interspersed through the book, and arranged so as to be interesting to the child. Long
tables of sounds without meaning, and of examples
without context, puzzle the pupil, and even if once
learned, are speedily forgotten; but if taught in sentences, to which interest and idea are attached, the
exercises will prove more permanent and thorough in
their effect. The lessons of this character scattered
through the following pages should be frequently returned to, and the scholars familiarly drilled inthat hole, and turned it round till it lifted up the
latch. As soon as the latch was lifted, the door
was open.
4. When she had been out in the woods or
fields all day, and came home at night, she would
be in great haste to get into the barn. She would
not there wait for the man who milked her. to
come and let her in, but would put her horn into
the hole, lift the latch, and walk in.
5. One day, some one put a small wedge in, on
the top of the latch, so that no one could open
the door on the outside. The old cow came hole,
went to the barn, put in her horn, tried to raise
the latch, but it would not move.
6. She gave her horn a twist, she turned it up,
and she turned it down, but all did not serve.
The door would not open. She tried, and tried,
and tried again, and at last lifted up her head
and began to moo.
7. As she was a still. cow, when the man who
took care of her heard what a noise she made,
he said, " Hark! what ails our old cow?  Can't
she get in the barn? I must go and see."
8. He found her by the door, with her head
up in the air, crying moo, oo, oo! with all her
might, as if to call some one to come and help her.
9. "Why does not the dunce open the door,"
said he, "as I have seen her do often and often'
I should like to know what is the matter w'h
her."

barn once more.  Ann was very fond of this
cow. It was a good cowv, was not cross, did not
Lick, nor hook with her horns.
12. So Ann would go up to her, pat her on her
head, put her arms around her neck, and smooth
her sides. Ann called her Bessy, and the cow
seemed to know her own name.

she would let her come up to her, aind pat her
on the neck, and make much of her.

and would stop for him on Ihis rettlrin.
7. So, after many days of t'ravel, they renched
Mr. Alden's house. It stood on a low mound, ill
the middle of a large garden filledl wvith trees.and   plants, mlany of whlicl Jollllhnny had never
seen before.
8. They were met at the gate b)y Ullcle Jolll;
and soon after, Inez cane runninllg out fi'om amonllOg
the bushes, with a t roop of little darlkeys after heri. i
9. "O Jollhnny! I aml so glad to see you!" said
she, as she took his hand, and led him up to the
house.  Herel Johnny and hiis fatther were received
with warl'l welconle.
10. The next day Mr. Alden left, telling Johnny
he mnust leairn  fiomn John and cousin Inez how
to make cotton.
11. After Mr. Alden had gone, Uncle John said:
"Johnny, don'tollu and Inez want to take a ride
with me  
12. " Oh, yes!" said Johnny. So they all went
down to the gate, where they found horses wait-.ing for them. There was a pony for Inez, and
one for Johnny, and a la,rge black horse for Uncle
John. They all mounted and r.ode offE
13. They soon came to the eotton-field.  
I:'X0'    Johnny, saw  bushes growing in rows, among
whose green leaves were seen the _ream-colored
cotton-flowers, and out of some 6f  e pods the
downy fibres of the cotton werej   bursting.
14. Between the rows, men,  omen, and boys
were at work, picking cotton, and putting it into
bags hung at their sides. These, when full, they
emptied into baskets at the end of the rows.
15. Johnny was so much pleased with what he
saw, and asked so many questions, that his uncle
told him he would that evening tell him all about
cotton-growing; and they rode towards home.

1. In  the evening,0 Uncle John, as he  hadpromised, gave Johnny an account of the manner
of raising cotton.

IJuly.  The water-furrows are now  ldeepened, so
that the cotton can grow on a sli'ght riclge.
6. " In July, wve look for the first blossoin, wrhich
is of a light crearnm-color. The blossom openi-s in
the night, relmains opuen till noon; wlihen it begins
to decay.  The next day it cllanges to a deep red,
and by sundowll its petals have fallen to the
earth, leaving what is called the " fo-rmi."
7. "You may see on the same cottojn-plant the
first open  blossom, the'l,olls,' or forms, firom
their first appleara.nce, throughl each degree of size,
until they blurst open)(  witll their riclh colltent:s.
8. "We begin picking tihe cottoni in the latter
pairt of July, and it lasts until Christmas.  It is
carrlied firom the field to the liacking-house; there
passed thouglh thle cotton-gin, which extracts the
seed finom it.  It is then put up in bales, and sent
to the llanding, for tleo stleambloat to carry it down
to Ne\yw 01rle1mns.
9. "Uicele Jolln," saidl Johnny, " your people
down hlre Imust mlllke a great deal of cotton, and
I deont see NOitt you can (do with it all."
10. "It is made into cotton cloths for shirts,
sheets, calico, sails, and a hundlred  other things.
Onily think of it, you can spin a thread out of a
pound of cotton more than a hundred miles long,
and when made into lace, this thread may be
worltlhl ilore thatn a hundred dollars.

EXAMPLES IN WORDS ENDING IN ough.
"Now,"7 said the school-teacher, one day, to a
class of boys and girls, "I want to see which of
you can spell and pronounce cough."
" K-a-u-f," said little Alice White.
"That is wrong," cried three or four voices.
"It is c-o-u-g-h, ka?.f."175
"That is riight," said the teacher.  " Alice spelt
it like the sound.  Now, if c-o-u-g-h spells kalf,
tell me what b-o-u-g-h spells."
" Ba,f," said two of the boys, at once.
"No," said  the  teacher.  "B-o-u-g-h  spells
bow."
"I don't see why," said another.  " If b-o-u-g-h
is pronounced bow, why is not c-o-u-g-h pronouncecd
cow.9"
" It is not the custom to pronlounce it so," said
the teacher; "that is the onlly reson.  Now,
which of you can tell me what r-o-u-g-h spells?
" Row," said( little Alice, quickly.
",J?tr af;" cried oult Artlulr, sure that he was
right this time.
"No," said the teacher, " you must pronounce
r-o-u-g-h, rueff
"Well," said Arthuir, " that is queer."
"Now, let me hear how you would  pronounce
d-o-u-g-h."
Some said dcow, some Cdauf, some dlff, but none
were right.
"D-ou-gr-h," said the teacher, "must be pronounced like doe. You see all the words are
spelt alike, except the first letter, and yet not one
is pronounced like the other. Now tell me how
you woild pronounce t-h-r-o-u-g-h."
"Is it throw?" asked Arlthur.
" It is unlike eitllher of the others, andll must be
pronounced as if it we1re spelt threw."
D "Do you ktnow wlhat h-o-u-g-h is?",,,                                                    0.--~-~---------

are designed to correct should at all times be avoided.
As thesd Readers advance beyond the merely primary, the contents more and more assnme a distinctly
Southern  character and scope.  The FOURTH  and

selections from Southern authors, or of articles on
Southern topics." No, sir."
"It is the lower part of the leg, and is pronounced as if it were spelt hok.
"But now tell me, if c-o-u-g-h is pronounced
kauf, how  h-i.c-c-o-u-g-h is pronounced."  Nobody knew.  "It is hik-?p."
" Well," said Arthur, "that is more queer than
ever."
" Yes, it is very queer; but as there is no rule
to tell us which way a word of this class is to be
pronounced, we must learn them all by heart. I
will now call off some words of this kind.
"Plough is pronounced plow, the same as bough.
Tough is pronounced tuff, the same as rough.
Though is pronounced tho, the same as dough.
Enough is pronounced e-nff, the same as tough.
Lough is a lake, and is prionounced lok.
Trough is pronounced trawf, nearlly like cough."

ROSE'S BIRTHDAY.
1. KATE.--This is the day that Blanch and Ida
are to come and see us, and we are to have a
fete* in the woods; and Aunt and Uncle Grant
are to meet us there.
2. RosE.--And as it is my birthday, I am to l)e

763. IKAT.--Ye(s, and I have made this oak wreath
for your fiock, aund now  I shall weave these
flowers for a -wrveath for your head.  As Blanch I
anld Ida com:e at two, we have ino time to spare.
4. The wreaths vwere made and put oll, and Rose
thought she looked qtuite like a queen.  Some of
the guests came, and they all iwent to the woods.
Thele were Blainch   and'Ida Grantlt, and Frank
and Ralph, who were Kate and Rose's brothers.
5. RALPII.-NOW  what game shall we play?
Shall we have hide and seek, blind-man's buff; or
hunt the slippler?
6. All said lhidle andl seelk, and. tllat Frank should
blide first.  So Frank ran oiV to hide. But he
did lnot see tlhat his little doi Brlluno had. come
with him, ulltil hII had fibunll a good place to hiide.
7. Ile then told Brulno to go back; but Briuno  
w\could lnot go, but sat onl his hind legs beggillg,
as if to ask to have his sllhare of the game.
8. So Frank took the (ldog in his arms' andl kept
him  close.  IIe soon lea'rd  the sound. of feet.
Firmt Rose'came in search of him, but she did not
see him.  Tlhen lalph camne so near as to touch
and shake tlhe bush.l near wlich lhe stood.
9. Butjnst j as Ralph was about to pass on, Biruno,
who did niot like to be held so fast, gave a low
whine, and  tllhen, of course, Franlk was found.
Ralph now took his turn to hide, and Rose soon
spied his hat thllrough an opening in the bush
belind which Ille was hiding.
1(0. Aftel-r Ralplh, RIose took her turn to hide, and: i g &lt;L-    so they kept on playing until each in turn had
hidden and been found.  Kate then said it was
five o'clock, and that they must go to the green
slope on the banlk of the lake.
11. There they found a feast of firuit and cakes
spread out on the turf for them, with papa, and
mamma, and Uncle Girant waiting for them.
They had grapes, and peaches, and plums, and
cakes.
12, They sat in the shade of some fine old trees.
The moss-grown turf was green, smooth, and soft;
and the cool lake, with the swans sailing up and
down, was like a large looking-glass.
LESSON XL.? v
ROSE'S BIRTHDAY.
(Continued.)
1. All at once, they thought they heard the
sound of a flute. " Hush!" said Frank. " Who can
it be?" asked Rose. "I think I know," said Ralph.
"It is Uncle Grant. I will run and fihd him."
2. Frank went, and he was soon seen coming
through the trees by the side of his uncle. When
they came, Mr. Grant said, " I thought you would
like to dance, and I have brought my flute to
play to you."
3. They all clied, "Thank you! thank you!" and
Mr. Grant at once began to play. They all
thought it great sport to be dancing on the
grass to the sound of a flute.
                           
784. They had been dancing for an hour, when
they saw a black cloud coming up fiom the west,
and a few drops of rain fell.
5. " Quick! quick!" cried mamma; "run to the
house. We shall have a storm, and you will be
wet through."
6. The lrain fell faster and faster. A lArge cloak
had been brought firom the house, to spread on
the grass, for mamma and Aunt Grant to sit on,
and the four girls all got under it.
7. Frank and Ralph laughed to see the black
cloak walking along, no heads to be seen, only
four pair of feet below it.  When they got into
the house, and took off the cloak, Rose's wreath
was quite spoiled.
8. But she did not carie for this. She was only
vexed with the rain.  "Do you think it will
leave off sooI?" she said to her mamma.
9. Her mother told her she thought itwould rain
for some time; and even if it did leave off, the
glrass would be too wet fo,r them to go out again.
10. "What shall we do?" said Rose. "The
rain spoils all our spQrts."
11. "We must see what we can do in the,house," said her mother.  "Are there no games
you can play?"
12. Rose could think of none; but Kate and
Blanch knew  a number of games.  There was
the game of questions, the game of stage-coach,
and a good many other games.
13. So Rose's birthday passed off with great

When a fish comes within reach, it strikes and
pierces it through with its sharlp bill, and then
swallows it whole.
3. Its nest is built in a large tree, in swamps, and
is made by laying sticks crosswise, and lining it
with grass and feathers. On moonlight nights it
will turn out to hunt for fish, reptiles, mice, or
young birds, on all of which it feeds.
4. It is very fierce when wounded, and the dog
or man who comes within reach is sure to rieceive a
severe wound. As it aims at the eye with its
long beak, the danger is great.

sun was so bright, the buds and grass so sweet,
that I could do nothi,g blut play and sing all the

5. "If that is the case," said the ant, " all I
have to say is, that they who eat, sing, and dance,
in the sumllmerl, must starve in tile wintel;" anld
so the poor' grasshopper had to go without tlle
grain.
6. I am sorry the ants were not more kind to
the grasshopper, but the fable teaches us a good
lesson. We should labor at the right time, and
while we are in health and strength, lay aside
something for the future.
7. We must plant and reap in the summer, in
order that we may eat in the winter; for if we
think onlly of play instead of work in our youth,
want will come upon us'in ouIr old age.

THE MONKEY AND THE CHILD.
1. A ship once had on board a pet monkey.
This monkey would climb the masts, Irun up and
down the rigging, and its antics made sport for
all:on board.
862. There was a lady on the ship who had a
baby, that was only a few weeks old.. One day
she laid the baby on a sofa that stood on the
deck, and wvent to the side of the ship.
3. She had left the child but a moment, when
the man who stood at the helm of the ship, cried
out, "Look at what the monkey has done!"
4. The mother tuined round, and saw  tlle
j monkey, with her baby in its arlms, climbing as
fast as it could the main-mast. The lady gave a
screami at the sight, and fell downi on the deck.
5. The captain was at his wits' end. He was
afi'aid that if he sent the sailors to climib up to
the monkey, it would drop the cliild in trying to
escape firom them.
6. The child was now heard to cry, and it was
feared that the monkey was hurting it. But the
monkey was soon seen dandling and soothing the
child, in the same way it had seen the nlurse do.
7. The lady had been taken to the cabin, where
she was kept only by force firom going on deck
and tlying to clinmb the mast. Many plans were
tlried to coax the monkey back on deck, but in
vain.
8. At last, the captain sent every man below
out of sight, and taking a place himself where
he could see and not be seen, watched to see
what the monkey would now do.
9. When the monkey saw the deck clear, it
/ came slowly d(own firom the mast, and placed the
i child on the sofa fiom which it had taken it.
~...10. Thle child was found not to be ill the least I
hurt. The joy of all on board was of coulse
great; bult the joy of the mothiel, when she saw
j her child safe in her arms, was beyond words.

LESSON XLVI..  
THE YOUNG PEDLER.
1. One rainy day, I heard a low knock at my
back-door, and upon going to it, found a pedler.
lie was a little boy, and looked so cold and wet,
that I asked him to come in by the fire.
2. tIe thougllt I meant to buy something, for
he opened his tin box, and looked up in my face
very sadly, when I told him to warm himself by
the fire, but that there was nothing I wished to
buy.
3. He rose slowly from his seat, and there was
something so sad in his face, that I asked him
why he was out in this cold, wet storm.
4. He said he could not stay in for a little rain,
as he had to earn his living.  "Besides," said he,
"on rainy days I can sell the most, for a good
many pedlers stay at home on those days."
5. " How much do you earn in a day?" I asked.

886. "Sometimes half a dollar, and sometiimes|
only a quarter; but once in a while I earn nothing
all (lay loncg."
7. Here he gave a quick, dry cough, which
imade me ask him, "How long have you had that
cough?."
8. "I do not know, mlladamI. It has been a
long tiile, though."
9. "Where does your motheir live? I Have you
a father?"
10. "Both mother and father are in heaven,
madam. I had a little sistelr, but she went to
mother about a month ago."
11. " Vhalt was the matter witll ler?"
12.  Slhe wanted to see mothller. And so do I;,
and I think that is why I cough so."
13. " What do you take foi your cough? a Whol I
do you live with?"
14. "I live with Mvs. Browivi.  But please,
madam, I do not want to take medicine. M,the,l
took it, an(d it did not help lier. Besi(les, I would
not stop my cough, for I want to go. anld join
motherl and fither. Good-day, madlan.'"
15. I stoppe(l him, bought a few things fromn
his. box, and told him to comne and see ine soon
again. IIe said that he would, if lie did not go
to mother, soon.
16. I asked him if he felt very sad when his
mother' died.;17. " I felt very big in my throat, and I thought!i was choked.  But I did not cry a bit,:though.
0                                            _ -I felt very lonely for a time. I was glad she
had gone up there."
18. He now bade me good-day, and went out
into the cold rainl, while I could only say, " God
be with you, my child!"
19. He never came again, though I looked for
him every day. About New-Year's day, I went
to the place he called his home. Mrs. Brown
was there, but the little pedler was at rest. He
had died a few weeks before.
20. His gentle knock would be heard no more
at the doors of those who, like myself, forget the
stern want that often sends these little pilgrims
from house to house.
21. And yet I was more glad than sad. How
much better it was that he should be with his
father, and motherl, and sister, up in heaven, than
living here in pain and want!

LESSON XLVII. /', M
ACTING A LIE.
1. "Charles, my dear," said Mrs. Wood to her
son, a boy of about twelve years of age, "how
didyou get into the flower-show?  You had no I
iE;E  S t':dti900  
90money to buy a ticket, and none were allowed to
go in fiee."
2. "Why, mother," said the boy, "I got MIr.
Jones to,iddress a niote for nle to the muanager.
I took the note to the gate, showed it to the
check-taker, who, thinkiug it was all right, let
mue in."
3. " And when you got in, what then?"
"Why, of course, as I hnad no real nlote for the
manager, I just walked about and looked at tlle
flow\'el'S."
4. " An(d did you not know how wrong all that
was?  I did not think my soIn could do sucli a
thi r'ig."
5. " How was it wrIong, mother?" asked Chlarles.
" I did not tell a lie, you know."
f6. " You did not tell a lie, but you acted one,
wlicth was full as sinful.  You made the checktaker think you had business witlh the nlalager,
and so let you in. That was deception, and dleception is lying."
7. "Is decepltion lying, nothel?" said Charles.
8. "It is just as w lrong to act a lie with youlll  
looks, as to speak it witlh yourli tongue.  It is just  
as wrOlng to,Yeenm to be whllat you are not, as to  
s8y you are'' w'hat you are not.  Do vo,) not see,
liy SOIn?"
9. "I did nlot thlillnk it co(uld be a lie inless I  
said it.  Illdecd, I a11 very, ve(y sorry."
10. " It is inot enlough to bie sorry, Charles. You  
must make amelnds.  The slhow was held to raise
m. z. = _ B o,...........__.....&gt;^. _fmoney for the poor. Not olnly did you act a lie,
but you wronged the poor out of the price of
the ticket."
11. "I will buy a ticket, mother, out of my
pocket-money, and send it to the manager. I
wish I had not done wrong, mother. Will you
forgive me?.
12. " You must not only buy a ticket, Charles,
but you must take it to the manager, and tell him
why you bring it."
13. " Oh, mother, I could not look him in the
face. I am ashamed to tell him what I did."
14. "' He will riespect you all the more for doing
so. Having done a wrong, you must not expect
God to forigive you, or others to forlgive you, until
you firankly confess your sin. It is hard to do
so, I know; but the way of the sinner is always
hard."
15. "But, mother, nu'st I do it?" asked Charles.
16. "Yes, Charles. I want you never to forget
this lesson. When you do a wrong, the only
way to expect forgiveness is to confess your fault
to those you have wronged."
17. Charles took the price of the ticket to the
manager, and told him what he had done. The
manager told him he was a bad boy to have done
what he did,'but a very good boy to come and
confess it; and that for his good act he should
always love and respect him.

THE LEOPARD.
1. Tle leopalrd is fouind in Asia  and Africa.
Do you know wiher~e those countrlies are.?  Look
in yolur atlas, andl you can learn.
2. It is like the tiger, oinly not much more than
half as large.  It will clinmb trlees like a cat, and
runs swiftly along the boughs in pursuit of its
priey.
3. It lives on deer, monkeys, and all kinds of
small animals.  Like all of the cat kind, it will
destroy more than it can eat, and is verly fierce.
4. The natives in Afriica capture it by digging
deep  hole., andl covering the top with branches,
leaves, and grass.  A piece of meat is then placed
in the centre.
r5. The leopard springs upon the piece of meat,
and crushing through the frail screen of leaves
and branches, falls to the bottom of the:pit.

936. It can be tamed, if taken young. A tame
leopard was once brought over in a ship from
Africa, which would r un up the rigging, play
with the sailors, jump upon their backs, and was
just like a playful kitten.
7. A lady once had a tame leopard which got
to be very fond of her.  It liked lavender water
so much, that she could get it to do almost any
thing she wished it to do, by giving it some of
the water.
8. But tame leopards must be kept well fed,
for fear, if they were to get hungry, they might
do some one injury.
9. I should not think it safe to have one around,
no matter how tame it might seem. If it should
by chance get the taste of blood, all its natural
fierceness might return.
10. The leopard is covered with many beautiful spots; and in Africa, it is hunted for its skin,
on which great value is set.

THE GRAPE-VINE.
1. Lily's father gave her a small grape-vine.
It grew by the side of the fence, and had six
bunches of grapes on it. The branch which had
two of the best bunches hung on Mr. White's
side of the fence.
2. Mr. White's boys used to play in their
father's yard near the fence.  One of them  one
day said, " All of the grapes that hang this side
of the fence are ours."
3. Lily heard him say this, and ran to her sis.
ter Mary to tell her. "There are six bunches,"
said she.  "I wanted the best two for father and
mother. Then I shall have one for Tom, one for
Harry, one for you, and one for myself.
4. " But," she went on to shy, " the two bunches
I wanted to give father and mother are on Mr.
White's side of the fence, and if his boys take
them, what shall I do 2" Mary could not tell, so
they went to their mother.
5. "Could you," asked their mother, "take
hold of the branch and pull it this side of the
fence?"  Lily told her she had tried to do. that,
but it was so stiff it almost broke off.
6. " I have long sinc9 made up my mind," said
the mother, " that he who plants a tree ought to
eat of its fruit; that all the fruit belongs to him,
let it grlow on which side of the fence it may.
But some, I know, do not think so."
