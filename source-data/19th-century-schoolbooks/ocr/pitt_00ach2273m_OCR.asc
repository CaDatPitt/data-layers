THREE BAD THINGS.’

I. There are three bad things which all

102 PROGRESSIVE SERIES.

should strive to avoid,-—bad thoughts‘, bad

words’, bad deeds’.  

2. A bad thought is the worst thing that can
get into a boy’s heart; and the longer it re-
mains there, the more mischievous it becomes.

3. It is more poisonous than arsenic, more
deceitful than a snake, and far more dangerous
than the bite of a mad dog.   ‘

4. A bad thought got into the heart of the
ﬁrst boy that ever was born, and it never left
him until it made him kill his brother.

% 5. Shun bad thoughts‘, fear them‘, hate them‘,
ﬁght against them’, pray against them‘. Be-

member, our thoughts are known in heaven.

6. Bad thoughts lead to bad words, which
have brought much evil into the world. They
creep through the ear into the heart, stir up
all its passions, and tempt it to break God’s
commandments.

7 ._ Stop your ears‘ against bad Words, and
run from those who use them as you would

" from a tiger. r

8. Never speak an unkind Word, an impure
word‘, ‘a lying word’, or a profane Word‘.

9. Bad deeds follow bad thoughts and bad ‘

words. Keep bad thoughts in your breast’, and
you are sure to use bad words‘; practice speak-
ing bad words’, and you are sure to do evil deeds‘.

10. Quench the ﬁrst spark’, and you will

OSGOODUS AMERZ CAN THIRD READER. 103

save the house from ﬁre‘; subdue the ﬁrst evil
thought’,;and the bad deeds will never be done‘.

11. Let your prayer be, “ Search me‘, O
God’! and know my heart‘; try me’, and know
my thoughts‘, and see if there be any wicked

way in me, and lead me in Wisdom’s ways ‘

which are ways of pleasantness’, and in her
paths which are all peace‘.”
12. Strive to ﬁll your hearts With good

thoughts; for they are the beginning of every

thing else that is good; and they are the best

cure for bad thoughts‘, bad Words’, and? bad

deeds‘. ;

1. “ Go and get it‘! Go and get it‘, I say!”
2. Poor little Dash crept close to his young
master’s feet’, looking up to his ‘face with earnest’,

' pleading eyes’, as if he would say, “ Please, please,

don’t! I cannot do What yo11 Wish me to do.”
.3. Tom. was trying to make Dash swim after

 aiiiistick’, which he had just thrown into the

river‘. “ .
4. Now Dash was not a water dog’, having

OSGOOD as AJIIERIOAN THIRD READER. 107

no more love for it than a cat‘; but foolish
Tom was resolved to make him one.

5. He kicked the poor little. animal away‘,
saying’, “Don’t crawl about my feet in that
way‘. Go and get the stick, I say.”

6. Then angry that the dog did not obey him’,

he seized him’, and threw him into the water‘. .

7. The dog was sorely frightened’, but by
hard struggling he reached the bank‘; and wet’,
panting’, and trembling’, he crawled with a

H pitiful whine to his master’s feet‘.

8. The cruel boy caught him up with rough

words’, and was just going to throw him in '

again‘, when a pair of strong arms seized him’,
and a man’s voice said’, .

9. “ Here‘, you young scamp‘! N ow, we’ll
see how you like to swim‘ !”

10. It was now Tom’s turn to be frightened.
He turned pale‘, trembled‘, and ‘caught his
breath’, as the stranger lifted him in his strong
arms‘.   ,

11. He began to beg, “Oh, sir’, pray’, pray
don’t‘! I cannot swim, indeed Icannot! Oh,
don’t throw meinto the water‘! I will never‘,
NEVER‘ do so again.”  Q o t

12. The man paused’, but did not let go his

hold‘. “Neither can your dog swim,” said 11¢-;-. . . .

“but you were going to make him swim, just
for your amusement. '

108 PROGRESSIVE SERIES.

13. “Why should I not make 3/ou swim for
my amusement‘? I am as much larger and
stronger than you’, as you are larger and
stronger than that poor’, panting’, trembling
dog.”  

414. Tom still begged and promised, and at
last the stranger let him go, saying, “Now, my
boy’, let me give you a kind word of advice;

15. “Never treat another’, Whether human
being or dumb animal’, as you would not like
to be treated yourself‘.

16. “Never try to make anybody or any-
thing do What God’,vvhen he oreatednit’, did

osaoopus AMERICAN THIRD READER. L 109

not make it to do‘, or to be What he did not

intend it to be‘.

17. “If you keep these rules’, you will be a
better‘, Wiser’, happier boy‘. Good-bye.”

18. And Tom knew in his heart that the
man was right; and that the lesson, though it
seemed severe, was given in real kindness.

friends who urged him. “ I’ll'wa1k, and take
a short cut through the pines;” and off he
started with a stout walking-stick.

attract notice as soon as the door was opened’,
he quietly laid it at the door and went away‘,
but not far’; for he hid behind a large rock
near the house’, to watch what became of it‘.
14. Soon he had the pleasure of seeing the

  little girl come out and seize it; and then he

went on his way rejoicing.

15. The silver dollar came into the young v

man’s hand for this very purpose‘; for’, you
see’, a paper dollar might have been blown

why’, he did not exactly know‘; but God’, who
directed his steps’, did know‘.

6. Now it happened that Harry had seen
his father prepare some compound rhubarb
pills that morning’, and he thought he would

try their effect upon his new patient.

the young doctor procured one of the pills’,
and dropped it into the open mouth of the con-

young doctor; “when I cure, I cure; and when '

I don’t cure, I kill.”

began to bloat and bloat, until Harry thought
he must be the frog alluded to in his “Reader”

10. A moment more and the poor patient
turned a livid purple‘, gave one last gasp’, and
expired‘; his ﬂy-catching days were ended‘!

down to meditate ‘ upon the virtues of com-

THE .PERSIAN YOUTH.

1. It is related of a Persian mother, that on
giving her son forty pieces of silver as his por-
tion, she made him promise never to tell a
lie; and then said, “ Go, my son; I commit thee
to God; We shall not meet again in this World.”

2. The youth Went away, and the party he
traveled with Was attacked by robbers. One
fellow asked the boy What money he had got,
and he said, “Forty pieces of silver are sewed
up in my garments.” I ‘ A

3. The robber laughed, and thought he was
only jesting. Another asked him the same
question, and received the sarneanswer.

4. At last the chief called him, and asked
him what he had.   He said, “I have told two
of your people already, that I have forty pieces
of silver sewed up in my clothes.”

5. He ordered the clothes toloe ripped open,
and found the money. “And l1ow came you
to tell this?” asked the chief.

 

 

6. “Because,” replied the youth, “I would
not be false to my mother, to Wl1om I prom-
ised never to tell a lie.”

7. “Child,” said the robber, “art thou so

mindful, at thy tender years, of thy duty to

thy mother, and am I so regardless, at my R

age, of the duty I owe to God? Give me thy
hand that I may promise to lead a better life.”
8. He did so. His followers were all struck
with the scene. “You have been our leader
in guilt,” saidthey to the chief, “now be the
same inthe path of virtue.” -

stolen, and began at once to lead honest lives.

horse whose fame was spread far and near‘;
and a Bedouin of another tribe’, Daher by
name, desired greatly to possess it‘.  

2. Having offered in vain his camelsand
his whole wealth for it’, he hit at length upon
the following device by which he hoped to
gain the object of his desire‘.

3. He resolved‘ to stain his face with the
juice of an herb‘, to clothe himself in rags‘,
to tie his legs and neck together’, so as to
appear like a lame beggar‘. ~ .

4. Thus equipped’, he Went to the roadside
where he knew that the owner of the horse

PRINCIPLES OF READING.   15

ACCENTUATION.

Accentuation is the act of applying accents in
reading and speaking.   u

Accent is that stress of voice applied to a certain

syllable, which distinguishes it from other syllables

of the same word.

All words of more than one syllable have one syl- ,

lable distinguished by accent, which is indicated by
this mark (’) ; as, mod’-ern.

Words of more than three syllables often receive
two accents of different degrees of force, called
primary accent and secondary accent.

Primary Accent is the greater stress of V0lC@_s
Secondary Accent is the less stress of Voice. "

When a Word has both accents, the primary may
be indicated by one mark (’), and the secondary by
two marks (”) ; as, lu’-mi-na”-tion.

RULES FOR PRON UN CIATION.

RULE  a11d to ending unaccented syllables‘

have their ﬁrst sounds, though somewhat shortened.
This rule is frequently violated by omitting the
sound of o or a.

EXAMPLES.

led his horse to the spot’, and with ‘great effort
set the seeming beggar on his horse’s back‘.

8. But no sooner did Daher ﬁnd himself in
the saddle than he pressed the broad stirrups’,
which had sharpened edges to answer for
spurs’, against the horse’s sides’, and galloped
off‘, calling out as he did so’, “It is I-.—Daher‘!
I have gotthe horse’, and I am away with the

‘treasure I have so long coveted‘.”

. 9. N aber called after him to stop and listen.

Certain of not being pursued’, "he turned and

halted ata short distance‘.

    10. “You have taken my horse,” said N aber.’

“Since heaven has willed it’, I wish you joy

with the animal‘; but I beg you never to tell

any one how you obtained it.”

11. “And why not‘?’,’ asked Daher.

12. “Because,” said the noble Arab’, “An-
other person might be really ill’, and’ men
would fear. to help him‘. You would be the
cause of many refusing to perform an act of
charity for fear of being dupedas I have been.”

13. Struck. with’ shame at these words’,
Daher was silent for amoment‘; then’, spring-

  ing from the horse’, he returned it to the

owner’, embracing him‘. ,
14. N aber made the Bedouin go with him

  to his tent, where they spent a few days ‘
~ together, and became fast friends for life.

SQUIRRELS.

 Squirrels belong to the great family of
rodents or gnawers, whose main business in
life seems to be gnawing. ‘

2. They almost disdain to eat any food that
does not have to be gnawed after‘, and when

they are no longer hungry’, they gnaw seem-
s ingly forpastime. '

152 " PROGRESSIVE BER IE8.

3. Rats’, and mice’, and hares’, and wood-
chucks’, and beavers’, all belong to this family.

4. In our Northern States there are about
ﬁve species of squirrels proper,——Gray’, Black’,
Red’, Striped’, and Flying‘.
’ 5. The Gray
Squirrel is the
largest of the
kinds just men-
tioned.

.6. He is a
handsome fel-
low‘, gray all’
over the back
and tail’, but a
* little tawny on
the head and
sides‘.

, 7. Heis easily tamed and made a pet of“,
becoming familiar as a kitten‘, and is the kind
most frequently seen turning in wheel cages’,
or riding on his master’s shoulder‘.

8. When wild’, he is seldom seen out of the
woods‘. c He builds his nest of twigs and
leaves in the branches of the largest trees’, or
in the hollow of a decayed tree-top.

9. Here the young are reared‘; and here he
retires withinadoors himself’, when the weather
is bad‘; for he likes to be dry and clean.

10. The Red
Squirrel is the
most familiar of
all our squirrels.

11. He is not A
more than half 
as large as the 
Gray’, but twice 
as nimble‘, and  
more graceful in  ‘
form and move-
ments‘, — really

  

an elegant creature; but he lacks dignity a '

little’, and his impudence is very provoking‘.

12. He is quite fond of showing himself‘,
and rather likes building his nest about the
house or grounds’, where it is less lonesome
than in the woods‘.

13. What he lives on’, depends upon where
he lives‘. If in the woods’, he lives on nuts‘;
if about the barn’, he lives on corn‘; if in the
big maple near the house’, he has no objection

to making his breakfast of fresh laid eggs out  

of the old robin’s nest close by‘; if in the
wood—shed’, he has not the slightest scruples
about stealing and carrying off the last one

and is commonly called the Chipmunk. ‘

8. He is smaller than the others, and most
abundant of all. He never goes up a tree
unless driven to it, and then is directly seized
with a ﬁt of dizziness.

9. He is stubby and stout of limb, and Well
adapted to digging. His hole descends straight
into the ground at ﬁrst, and then Winds off
under ground for some distance. At the far-
ther end is his nest, and there he lays up his
Winter supplies.

protruding. Between his fore and hind legs is

of thy youth, while the evil days come not,
nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say,

or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds’

bow themselves, and the grinders cease be-

Windows be darkened, andathe doors shall be
shut in the streets;

4. When the sound of the grinding is low,-
and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird,
and all the daughters of music shall be
brought low;

' 5. Also when they shall be afraid of‘ that

which is high, and fears shall be in the Way,

  and the almond tree shall ﬂourish, and the’

grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire

and the mourners go about the streets:
7. Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the

golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be  
broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken

taken out by a machine called a cotton-gin,
and the cotton is carded and spun and woven
mostly by machines. There are many cotton
mills in New England. _
, 5. In India, where labor is cheap, it is spun
and woven by hand; and some very ﬁne and
beautiful muslins are produced in this way.

Our ﬁrst printed cotton goods came from Cali- '

cut,,or Calcutta, whence it was called calico.
Cotton was used inlndia longer ago than his-
tory can tell us.

6. Cotton grows in most swarm countries;
but no other country has yet been able to pro-
duce so good an article as theSouthern United
States. p

PRINCIPLES OF REA DING. 17

A , EMPHASIS,

Emphasis is that stress of voice, applied to a
certain word, which distinguishes it from other
Words in the same sentence.

Emphatic words are sometimes indicated by italic letters,

though it is generally left to the reader to determine where
emphasis should be placed. When different degrees of empha-

E sis are applied to words in the same connection, the least em-

phasis may be denoted by italics, the next by SMALL CAPITALS,
and the most emphatic by LARGE CAPITALS.

EMPHASIS may be divided into Antithetic, Absolute,
and Cumulative.
  Antithetic Emphasis,

EMPHASIS Absolute Emphasis,
E Cuinulative Emphasis.

ANTITHETIG EMPHASIS.

lantithetic Emphasis is that which is applied
to the contrasted words of an antithesis.
Antithesis, from which this division of emphasis derives its

name, may be deﬁned a phrase or sentence in which words are
contrasted with each other.

RULE I.—The contrasted words of an antithesis
must be emphasized.

horse’s face‘. ‘

9. There were two frogs, one on each side
of him, sitting just as he Was, which pleased
John, so he began to laugh instead of to cry;
but the frogs jumped into the water.

10. “It is time for me to go on,” said Solo-
mon John. So he gave a jump, as he had seen
the frogs do ; and this time he came all right
on the horse’s back, facing the Way he was

J going. “It is a little pleasanter‘/’ said he.‘

11. The horse wanted to nibble a little of
the grass by the side of theway; but Solomon

a little lane by Farmer J ones’s house’, to get a

slowly that Solomon John thought he would

3. He whistled‘, and shouted‘, and thrust his

4. “Perhaps the apples are too heavy for _

of the apples out of the basket. It hit the
fence by the side of the road’, and that started
up the horse’, and he went on merrily‘.

him off at a great pace‘. But very soon he
fell again into a slow walk.

7. Solomon John had to try another apple.
This time it fell into a pool of water, and
made a great splash, and set the horse off
again for a littlewhile; but he soon returned
to a slow walk,——so slow that Solomon John
thought it would be to-morrow morning before
he got to the cider mill. ,

8. “ It is rather a waste of apples,” thought
he; “ but I can pick them up as I come back,
because the horse will be going home at a
quick pace.” '

9. So he ﬂung out another apple; that fell
among a party of ducks, and they began to

osaoopus AMERICAN THIRD READER. 173

make such a quacking and a waddling, that it
frightened the horse into a quick trot.

10. So the only way Solomon John could
make his horse go, was by ﬂinging his apples,
now on one side, now on the other.

11. One time c ' _
he frightened a  
cow, that ran  
along by the
side of the road,
while the horse
raced with her.

12. Another
time he started
up at brood of
turkeys, that
gobbled and
strutted enough to start twenty horses.

13. In another place he came near hitting a
boy, who gave such a scream that it sent the
horse off at a furious rate. d

14. And Solomon John got quite excited
himself, and he did not stop till he had thrown
away all his apples, and had reached the corner
by the cider mill.

15. “Very well,” said he, “if the horse is so
lazy, he won’t mind my stopping to pick up the
apples on the way home; and I amnot sure but I
shall prefer walking a little to riding the beast.”

16. The man came out to meet him from
the cider mill, and reached him the jug.

turned his horse’s head round; and, delighted
at the idea of going home, the horse set off
at a full run, Without Waiting for the jug.

18. Solomon John clung to the reins, and
his knees held fast to the horse. He called out
“Whoa! whoa I” but the horse Would not stop.

21. “We will see‘. I am no boaster’; I
promise what I can perform‘.”  
22. Having said this’, he walked slowly to
the end of the room’, placed the stool in the
very corner’, close 11p to the wall, and waved
his wand‘. '  
23. “Will any one please to jump over this

you shall not outwit us that way.”

28. Then she tried to look very grave, but
it was no- use trying. There was twinkling
about her eyes, and every dimple on her cheeks
looked like a laugh just ready to break forth.

29. “No‘, my friends’, I am too great a
master of my art to resort to such small

tricks; I shall do just what I promise‘.”

30. “Behold this nut‘!” said he’, as he held
up something in his hand‘; “this is a Spanish

31. ‘I‘ Look at it again‘! You see that it
has a sound shell. Within is a kernel which
no one has ever seen: I will now show it to

32. Then he cracked the nut and held up
the kernel. “Here‘,” said he’, “is something
which no eyes have ever looked upon before‘.
This is the ﬁrst and the last time that it will
ever be seen.”

33. As he said this he put it into his
mouth, and began to eat it.

but I hope to meet you again, when I shall
be able to convince you that I am what I

Seasons passed over it, and it became a tree.

I. Look at the stars‘! How bright they
are‘! How they twinkle‘! Men are proud of
their skill; but not all the men in the World’,

with all their boasted ‘skill’, can make one

little star, and hang it in the sky. God made

the stars‘, and keeps them bright’, and com-

mands them to stayin their places‘.

2. Great kings boast of their might; but
not all the kings of the earth, with all their
might, can give life; no‘, not to one poor’,
small’, weak worm that crawls on the ground.
God can give life’, and takeit away‘; life and
death are in his hands.  

3. Some men are proud of what they know;
but not all the wisest men in the world can
tell what a ‘day may bring forth, or say
whether they or their friends will be well the
next hour. God knows what will happen to
each one of us; and health is his to give or
to take away.

4. Some men are proud that they are strong;
but not all the strongest men in the world
can drive back the sea, or stay the wind, or
hold the clouds and prevent the rain from
falling. God can hold the sea, and still the
wind, and stay the rain.

5. Oh, ‘how great is God! He sees us in
all places, and knows our very thoughts; how
we must ‘fear him! Yes, and love him, ‘too;
for he is good and kind, as well as great and
strong; and, if we seek him, and pray to him,
he will bless us in youth and in old age, and
take _care of us in life and in death.

PREFACE.

STEADY and easy progression isla prominent feature in this as well as

_the preceding books of this Series.

No word of more than two syllables is found  the spelling or reading
lessons of the ﬁrst forty pages; and, in the remainder of the book, no

word of more than three syllables is used.

The new words in the reading lessons are kept within proper limits; not
so many as to overtask and thereby discourage the pupil, nor too few, to

secure his constant advancement.

In the ﬁrst part of the book, all of the new words are placed at the head
of the reading lessons in which they occur for the ﬁrst time; in the mid-
dle portion, a few easy words of one and two syllables are introduced into
the reading lessons without being previously presented in. a spelling ex-
ercise; and, in the last part, only those words that require deﬁnition are
placed at the head of the reading lessons.

In addition to a‘ spelling or deﬁning lesson, there are exercises in articu-
lation and’ pronunciation at the head of nearly every reading lesson.
These exercises, if properly used, will be powerful aids in securing an
easy and critical pronunciation, which is an indispensable requisite to

good reading.

The selections in this book ‘have been made from the very best juvenile
literature of the present day, and cannot fail to produce a good and last-
ing impression upon the youthful mind.

1. Who is lovely‘? It is the girl who scat-
ters Sweet   Smiles‘, loving Words‘, and kind
deeds all along her pathway through life.

2. Kind Words’, and kind deeds’, and even
kind looks’, are better than pearls or precious
stones. ’     S

3. Pearls and precious stones please the
eye’; but kind Words and acts charm and
gladden the hearts of those who utter and do
them’, and of those also Who hear and See them‘.

4. My dear girls’, if you had a never-failing

supply of pearls and precious Stones, Would
you not be Willing to scatter them around you’,
that all who wished might pick them up’?

38 PROGRESSIVE SEE IES.

5. You have a never—fai1ing supply of kind
Words ‘ and sweet looks‘; more than you can
ever use‘. The more you use’, the more you
will have to use‘.  

.6. Then give a friendly hand to the friend-
less‘, smile on those whose hearts are ﬁlled
with sorrow‘, speak kindly to those who are
in trouble’, and always try to spread around

i you joy and sunshine‘.

7. Do this‘, and you will make more hearts
glad than you would’, if you were to scatter

pearls and precious stones.

Little deeds of kindness, >

TI-IE DONKEY AND THE PIGS,

1. A friend of mine had a pet donkey,who

had a ﬁeld all to himself, where he could Walk

or run, lie down or stand up, eat or sleep, and
in fact, do as be pleased.

2. After a while he began to think the ﬁeld
was all his own, and that no onelhad a right
to share it with him.

 One day, two pigs were put into the ﬁeld.

‘sWhen they came near the donkey, he 'looked
up att-hem, as much as to say, “Halloo! who .

’ OSGOODUS AMERICAN THIRD READER. ’ 47‘

are you, I would like to know, and What do
you want here?” ’

4. But he was a good donkey, and did not
go near the pigs to drive them off or to do
them harm.   ‘

5. He only gave a loud bray, as much as to
say, “The ﬁeld is large, and there is room for
all three of us; but you must keep the peace,
and not ﬁght and squeal.”  

6. And then ~munch, munch, munch, the
donkey went on eating his grass. By and by
he "heard a loud squeal. He looked up, and
saw the two pigs ﬁghting for some fruit that
had been left in the ﬁeld. s

7 . They were running at each other‘, biting
and pushing each other‘, squealing and making

such a noise and turmoil’, that the donkey ;

could not eat his grass in peace‘.
8. So he ran up to them’, and gave a loud
bray‘; and if hecould have spoken’, I think

he would have said’, “You had pigs’,,be quiet‘ ;,

stop your ﬁghting and squealing‘, and eat
your fruit in peace‘. ‘ ~ ’

9- “If you run’, and push’, and squeal’, and‘

ﬁght’, and make such .a noise’, ‘I will ﬁnd a
way to make you keep quiet‘, which 7you' will
not like‘.’’ i

10. But, when the pigs heard the donkey

bray’, they would not mind him. If . pigs

is only a donkey‘; and if We choose to light.

and squeal’, who is going to stop us‘? Not
that old donkey‘. Let him do his best or his

Worst‘, We will do as We please‘, ﬁght or let

it alone‘.”    
11. Then one gave a push’, and the other a
shove‘; one gave a loud squeal’, and the other

an angry grunt‘; and raised such a tumult

that the poor donkey could bear it no longer‘.
12,  seized one of the pigs by the ear’,

and raised him from the ground‘: he swung

him this Way’, and he swung him that‘; he

raised him up’, and he let him down‘; till the

poor pig had hardly breath enough‘ left to
make a squeal‘. ‘

osaoopus AMERICAN TIIIRD READER.   49

13. Then he let him fall to the ground’, and
brayed again‘; as if to say, “There‘; I think I
have taught you a lesson‘. I think you will
not ﬁght and squeal any more at present’, but
will be quiet and let me eat my grass in peace.”

14. And the donkey was right. The pigs
stopped their ﬁghting‘, became quiet as mice’,
and went on eating their fruit‘.

MY PET MONKEY.

1. When I was about ﬁfteen years old’, my
brother’, who was captain of ‘a trading vessel’,

‘made a present of a monkey to me‘.

_ 2. J ocko’, which was the name n1y brother
had given to the monkey’, was young and very
shy. He was as quiet as a mouse’, and as

’ gentle a creature as any boy could wish for.
3. He “had long’, glossy black hair’, and I ,

thought he was handsome‘; but my sister
Bessie said that he was so ugly‘ that she could
not bear to look at him.  

  4. I was very fond of pets, and with this
monkey I was greatly pleased. For many
weeks after my brother gave him to me’, he
was my constant playmate.

5. By degrees he became less shy; and as
he grew older’, he began to show his real
monkey nature. I ' 

6. There was no end to hismischief‘; he
was never still for a second‘, and was always
doing something Wrong‘, and yet What he did
was so funny’ that I had not the heart to
punish him. _ ‘

8. Our home at that time was in the coun-
try, and so J ocko had a wide ﬁeld for mischief.
My father had given me a small piece of
ground for a garden, and I took a pride in
keeping it in the very best order. I had some
choice ﬂowers and plants to the care of which
I gave some of my time each day. '

9. J ocko went with me to my garden as
well as other places, and it was not long till
he began to show as great fondness for this
kind of work as ‘myself. But his plan of
working was to do as much mischief as he
could‘, and in a few weeks he had picked off
all my blossoms’, and pulled up all my choice
plants by the roots‘.

would walk around her’, pulling her tail and
her fur‘.

13. But the kitten would keep on lapping,
and when Jocko A} could bear it no longer’, he
would seize her by both ears’, drag her head
up’, snatch away the cup and break it, or
nimbly jump up on a table, and place it out
of the poor kitten’s reach. ‘

Each day and every day;
Then peace shall gild your Way,

Where there was a tree full of ripe cherries.

2. “Oh, Frank,” said one of them, “let us
pick some of these red cherries: look, how
ﬁne they are!”

3. “No, Willie,” said the other, “we must
not touch them. You know we were told not

. to pick one of them.’

  is so kind that he would not hurt you‘.”

A :EiIT OF ADVICE FOR BOYS.
1. Boys’, you are made to be kind‘, noble’,
and generous‘.  

2. If there is a boy in  school who has’

a club-foot’, do not let himi‘ know that you
ever saw it‘. _
_ 3. If there is a poor boy with ragged
clothes’, do not talk about rags when he is
in hearing‘.

4. If there is a lame boy’, give him some part
of the game which does not require running‘.

5. If there‘ is a hungry boy’, give him a
part of $ your dinner‘. . L

6. If there is a dull boy’, help him to get

 lessons‘.

7. If there is a bright boy’, do not be en-
vious of him‘; for if one boy is proud of his
talents’, and another is envious of them’, there
are two great Wrongs’, and no more ‘talents
tlifan before‘.  

osaoozrs AMERICAN THIRD READER. 75

8. If a stronger boy has injured you, and

is sorry for it, forgive him, and ask the teacher
not to punish him. All the scholars will show

by their looks how much better such conduct

is than to have a hard ﬁst.

8 PRINCIPLES OF READING.

Elementary Sounds are divided into three classes:
Vocals, Subvocals, and Aspirates.

Vocals.
ELEMENTARY SOUNDS Subvocals.
Aspirates;

Vocals consist of pure tone or vocality.  They
are twenty in number.  

Subvocals are imperfect tones, being formed of
pure tone and breath united. There are ﬁfteen sub-
Vocals. _ T

Aspirates have no tone or vocality, being formed

of breath alone. They are ten in number.

Correct pronunciation is almost entirely dependent upon a
just articulation, and without the former no one can hope to
become an elegant speaker or reader. Correct articulation,
therefore, lies at the very foundation of good delivery; it is
thebasis upon which all that is excellent and beautiful in
reading and speaking rests.

To secure perfection in articulation it is necessary to master
the TABLE OF ELEMENTARY SOUNDS, and the EXERCISES IN
ARTICULATION which follow. Let a small portion of this table
or of these exercises be practiced every day.

TABLE OF ELEMENTARY SOUNDS.

THE elements in the following table must be uttered
by the teacher ﬁrst, and then by the class individually,
or in‘ concert. In order to give each element cor-
rectly, pronounce the word containing it distinctly

SOVVING LITTLE SEEDS.
3 1. Llttle Bess1e has a new book’, with which

she is Very much pleased.  
2. ‘She is looking at the ﬁrst picture. It is

the picture of a boy standing by the side of a,

stream’, and throwing seeds into the water‘.

osaoozws AMERICAN THIRD READER. 81

3. “I wonder what the picture is about,”
said she; “why does the boy throw seeds into
the water '2” s   I

4. “Oh, I know,” said her brother Charlie,
who had been looking at the book, “he is sow-
ing the seeds of water lilies.”

5. “But how small the seeds look‘ !” said Bes-
sie. “It seems strange to think that such large
plants should grow from such little things.”

6. “You are sowing just such tiny seeds
every day‘, Bessie’; and they will come up large,
strong, plants, after a while,” said her father.

  7. “Oh, no‘! father’; I have not planted any
seeds for a longtime‘.”  

8. “‘Yes‘, Bessie’, you have been sowing
seeds this Very day‘.”

9. Bessie looked puzzled‘, and her father

smiled’, and said; “I will tell you what I mean.
10. “When you broke the dish that you

  knew your mother Valued’, and went at once

and told her’, you were sowing seeds of truth‘.
, 11. “When you took the cup of cold water
to the poor woman at the gate’, you were sow-
ing seeds of kindness‘.
12. “When you did not get angry’, but spoke

kindly to the little girl that made faces at you’,

and called you names’, you were sowing’ the
seeds of mercy‘.   s

 If you perform such deeds as.these’,'

82 PROGRESSIVE SERIES. ;

you will sow seeds in your own heart‘, and in
the hearts of others’, that will spring up and
bear the most beautiful ﬂowers‘; not ﬂowers

of the garden or ﬁeld’, but what may be called,

the ﬂowers of the heart‘; such as love’, kind-
ness’, mercy’, joy’, and truth‘.
14. “I hope you and Charlie will always

sow such seeds‘; and above all’, I hope that
I you will plant the great tree of ‘Love to God;’

and that you will tend and water it until its

‘branches reach the skies’, and meet before his

throne‘."’

DROVVNING THE SQUIRREL;

~1.r One morning as I was going to school’,
when I was about ten years old’, I saw a
ground squirrel run into his hole in the ground
before me. it

2. I thought’, “ N ow I will have some fun‘.”
As there was a stream of Water just at hand’,
I resolved to pour water into the hole’, and
force the little creature to come out’, sothat I
might kill it.

3. I was soon pouring Water in on the poor

squirrel. I could hear it struggling to get up’,

and said, “Ah’! my ‘ﬁne fellow’, I will soon
have youout now‘l”   ,

4:. Just then I heard a Voice behind me;
“Well, my boy’,what have you got there‘?”

5. I turned’, and saw one of my neighbors‘;
a good old man’, with long white looks’, that
had seen sixty winters‘;

6. “Why’,” said I, “there is a ground squir-

rel in here; and I am going to drown him o11t.”

86 PROGRESSIVE SERIES.

7. “ Edward’,” said he, “whenl was a little
boy’, more than ﬁfty years ago’, I was engaged’,
one day’, just as you are’, drowning a squirrel‘.

8. “An old man’, such as I am’, came along
and said to me, ‘You are a little boy‘; now’,
if you were down in a hole like that, and I
should come along and pour water down upon
you to drown you’, would you not think me

  very‘ cruel’?

9. “ ‘God made that little squirrel‘; he made

it to live‘, to enjoy the bright sunlight‘, the  
p pure air’, the free ﬁelds and woods‘; and its

life is as sweet’, as dear to.it’, as your own is
to you‘. r   .

10. “‘It is one of God’s creatures’, and has a
right from God to live‘. Why then will you
destroy a creature that Godhas made‘?

11. “ ‘Why will you take from the poor little
harmless squirrel that life which God has given
to it; that life which once taken you can never
give back to it‘?’ He added, “ I have never
forgotten that, and never shall.  

12. “Now, mydear boy’, I want you to re-:
member this as long as you live‘. When you
are tempted to destroy a ﬂy’, a bird’, or any
little animal’, remember that God does not al-

"low us to kill his creatures for our amusement‘.”

13. More than forty years have since

    ‘passed, and I have not forgotten what the good

OSGOODUS AMERICAN THIRD READER. 87

man said‘; nor have I ever killed the least
animal for amusement since.”

14. Now, you see it is ninety years since
this advice Was ﬁrst given, and it has not
lost its effect yet. How many little creatures

it has saved from a cruel death, I cannot tell:'

but I have no doubt a great number.

15. Boys and girls’, please remember this
Story‘, and when you see little insects’, little
birds’, or any little animals’, do not hurt them‘.

E Your Father in heaven made them‘; and he

never intended them to be killed for amusement.

“ If I could only learn to read‘! will no one
teach me how’?”

He Whispers to a little boy’, who stands be-
side him now‘. .

“What will you give‘?” the lad replied,

“and I will teach you well‘,

The bargain struck’, they side by side’, upon
a step sit down‘,

And day by day the little sweep for a fresh
lesson came.

Then one lad, and then another would leave
the merry game,

To sit beside their pupil there, and teach
him how to read:

To sooty hands, or sooty face, the lads gave
little heed.

5. Ere long the books told tales at home, at

school they did the same, -

And so no one would teach the sweep, the
next day when he came.

And when he asked the reason why; “Our
books grow black,” they said;

.“We dare not let you touch our books,
yours is a dirty trade!”  

6. “I know it is,” replied the sweep; “but I
can learn as well,
If you will come aside with me, and teach
me how to spell, I
Upon those grave-stones in the yard, the
church-yard close beside.”

A lad consents, the lessons given, the sweep’

one copper paid;
And day by day to that strange school
I . the boy returns to learn,
Unto his teacher giving still, what odd
pence he may earn.

7. And, I have read’, if memory serves to tell
the tale aright’,
That that poor sweep became a man of
y ‘ learning fair and bright‘;
A useful man‘, and true’, and good‘; an
  honor to his name,
And much I wish that each of you, _ my
boys’, may be the same.

8. And now to play‘; but yet’, my lads’, bear

4. Jessie stopped to look at it as it twinkled
in the sun. She stooped down and put in her
hand to stop it. It would not be stopped.

 It jumped over her hand and through her
ﬁngers’, and ran off as fast as it could go‘.

6. While Jessie was playing with the Water’,
she lost something‘; but she did not miss it then.

7. The brook would not stop; and perhaps
this put the little girl i inmind that she ought
not to stop, so she jumped up and hurried to
school.   ‘

8. When she reached the‘ school-house’, the
door was locked; and a card with the startling

Word “ Late‘ !” printed in large letters upon it’,

hung at the door‘.
9. “ Oh dear, dear‘!” cried Jessie, very much

vexed; “now I shall get a load mark, for I v

have no good excuse.”  
  10. When the door was unlocked, she Went
in, and at noon she told Miss Marv.i.n how it
happened that she was late.

11. “You met with a serious loss at the

'brc:ok, did you not’, J essie’?” said Miss Marvin,

“something which you can never ﬁnd.”

12. “Loss!” said little Jessie, looking up,
surprised. ' “Iidid not miss anything. It was
not my spelling-book, surely’?”

13. “ A greater loss than your spelling—book,

because your spelling-book might be picked up,

or you could buy another,” said theteacher.

.14. “Not mysilver thimlole’?” said Jessie,
feeling in herpockets.  

— 15. “ A silver thimlole might be found,” said
Miss Marvin; “but this cannot be.”

16. “Do you think that I lost my box of

  beads?” asked Jessie.

17. “If you had’, I suppose you could easily
buy another boX‘.” ‘
18. “So I could a slate pencil, if I had lost
that.”    

19. “Yes‘,” said Miss Marvin; “b11t What
you lost cannot be found nor bought again,
nor can it be made up in any way‘; it is lost
forever‘ 1” I I A

'20. “Oh,” said Jessie, looking sorry and
puzzled; “ but what is it, Miss Marvin?”
  21. “It  time, Jessie,” said the teacher.
. 22. “Yes,” said the little girl, blushing,
“that I did lose by the brook. I lost time.”

23. “And you missed it very much when you
reached the school-room door,’.’said the teacher.

24. “Oh, I did! Miss Marvin,” said Jessie,"
“I did! I would have given anything for a
minute more.” 

25. “But a minute lost is lost forever‘! It

is said that a queen of England, who had not
long to live’, cried out, ‘Thousands of pounds
for an inch of time‘!’ But thousands of poundsf
could not buy it. E

enough to use’, but none. to lose‘! Try to Spend
them in such ‘a manner that you may give for
every day, ‘some good account at last .’ ”
