intendents of schools in large cities have declared in advance their
desire to introduce this book as a class reader, thus securing an elementary acquaintance with American history without overcrowding
the course of study.  In using the book as a reader, the topical
questions will still be of service to make sure that attention has been
given to the substance of the lesson.
The definitions at the close of each lesson give chiefly the meaning of the word as used in the text. It is important that the pupil
pass no word without a clear comprehension of its force, and that
he be taught to observe carefully the pronunciation of proper names.
The judicious teacher will take pains to have the pupil examine
the illustrations carefully, and make sure that their force is understood. The maps will be readily comprehended, and are not likely
to be slighted.make him a printer. So Benjamin was apprenticed to his
older brother, James Franklin, who already had a printing office.  Benjamin liked this trade, and learned very
fast.  As he was often  sent to  bookstores, he got a
chance to borrow books.  He sometimes sat up all night
to read one of these, taking great care to keep the books
clean and to return them soon.
Benjamin took a fancy to write poetry about this time.
His brother printed this " wretched stuff," as Franklin afterwvards called it, and sent the boy around the town to peddle it. Ben was very proud of his poetry until his father
made fun of it, and told him  that "verse-makers were
generally beggars."
Franklin had a notion as a boy that it was wrong to
eat meat, so he told his brother that if he would give
him half of what his board cost, he would board himself.
After this, Benjamin made his dinner on biscuit or a tart
from the baker's. In this way he saved some of his board
money to buy books, and used the time while the other
printers were at.dinner to study.
James Franklin, Benjamin's brother, printed a little
newspaper. Franklin was printer's boy and paper carrier,
for after he had worked at printing the papers, he carried them  around to the houses of the subscribers.  But
he also wanted to write for the paper.  He did not dare
propose so bold a thing to his brother, so he wrote some
articles and put them under the printing-office door at
night.  They were printed, and even Benjamin's brother
did not suspect that they were written by the boy.
88The two brothers did not get on well together. The
younger brother was rather saucy, and the older brother,
who was high-tempered, sometimes gave him a whipping.
James Franklin once printed something in his newspaper which offended the government of the colony. He
was arrested  and put into prison for a month; for the
press was not free in that day.   Benjamin published the
paper while his brother was in prison, and put in the
sharpest things' he dared to  say about the  government.
After James got out of prison he was forbidden to print
a newspaper any longer.  So he made up his mind to print
it in the name of his brother Benjamin.  In order to do
this he was obliged to release Benjamin Franklin from his
apprenticeship, though it was agreed that Ben was to remain at work for his brother, as though still an apprentice,
till he was twenty-one years old. But Benjamin soon got
into another quarrel with his brother James, and, now
that he was no longer bound, he left him. This was not
fair on his part, and he was afterwards sorry for it.

Franklin, the Printer.
WHEN Ben Franklin left his brother he tried in vain to
get a place in one of the other printing offices in Boston.
But James Franklin had sent word to the other printers
not to take Benjamin into their employ.  There was no
other town nearer than New York large enough to support a printing office.  Franklin, who was now but seventeen years old, sold some of his books, and secretly got
aboard a sloop ready to sail to New York. In New York
he could find no work, but was recommended to try in
Philadelphia.
The modes of travel in that time were very rough.  The
easiest way of getting from Boston to New York was by
sailing vessels. To get to Philadelphia, Franklin had first
to take a sailboat to Amboy, in New Jersey.  On the
way a squall of wind tore the sails and drove the boat to
anchor near the Long Island shore, where our runaway
boy lay all night in the little hold of the boat, with the
waves beating over the deck and the water leaking down
on him. When at last he landed at Amboy, he had been
thirty hours without anything to eat or any water to drink.
Having but little money in his pocket, he had to walk
from Amboy to Burlington; and when, soaked with rain,
he stopped at an inn, he cut such a figure that the people
came near arresting him for a runaway bond servant, of
whom  there were many at that time.  He thought he
might better have stayed at home.
9goThis tired and mud-bespattered young fellow got a chance
to go from Burlington to Philadelphia in a rowboat by
taking his turn at the oars. There were no street lamps in
the town of Philadelphia, and the men in the boat passed
the town without knowing it.  Like forlorn tramps, they
landed and made a fire of some fence rails.
When they got back to Philadelphia in the morning,
Franklin-who was to become ill time the most famous
FRL--  N -N  PHLDLH.. -,         _...

man in that town-walked up the street in his working
clothes, which were badly soiled by his rough journey.
EIis spare stockings and shirt were stuffed into his pockgiets. He bought three large rolls at a baker's shop. One
of these he carried under each arm; the other he munched
as he walked.
As he passed along the street a girl named Deborah
Read stood in the door of her father's house, and laughed
at the funny sight of a young fellow with bulging pockets
and a roll under each arm.  Years afterwards this same
Deborah was married to Franklin.
Franklin got a place to world with a printer named
Keimer.  He was now only a poor printer-boy, in leather
breeches such as workingmen wore at that time.  But,
though he looked poor, he was already different from
most of the boys in Philadelphia.  He was a lover of good
books.  The boy who has learned to read the best books
will be an educated man, with or without schools.  The
great difference between people is shown in the way they
spend their leisure time.  Franklin, when not studying,
spent his evenings with a few young men who were also
fond of books.  Here is the sort of young man that will
come to something.
I suppose people began to notice and talk about this
studious young workman.  One day Keimer, the printer
for whom Franklin was at work, saw, coming toward his
office, Sir William Keith, the governor of the province of
Pennsylvania, and another gentleman, both finely dressed
after the fashion of the time, in powdered periwigs and
silver knee buckles, much as you see in the picture on the
next page.  Keimer was delighted to have such visitors,
and he ran down to meet the great men. But imagine his
92disappointment when the governor asked to see Franklin,
and led away the young printer in leather breeches to
talk with himn in the tavern.
The governor wanted Franklin to set up a printing office
of his own, because both Keimer and the other master
printer in Philadelphia were poor workmen.
But Franklin had no money, and it took a
great deal to buy a printing press and types  j,
in  that day.  Franklin  told
the  governor  that he  did
not believe his father would
help him  to buy an outfit. p
But the governor wrote a
letter  himself  to  Frank-                    h
lin's father, asking him  to
start Benjamin in business.
So  Franklin  went back
to Boston in a better plight  mk mn  
than  that in  which  he    -~z-'.-~
had  left.  He had  on a          FRANKLIN AND THE GOVERNOR.
brand  new  suit of clothes,
he carried a watch, and he had some silver in his pockets. His father and mother were glad to see him once
more, but his father told him he was too young to start
in business for himself.
Franklin returned to Philadelphia.  Governor Keith,
who was one of those fine gentlemen that make many promising speeches, now offered to start Franklin himself.  He
wanted him to go to London to buy the printing press.
93He promised to give the young man letters to people in
London, and one that would get him the money to buy
the press.
But, somehow, every time that Franklin called on the
governor for the letters he was told to call again.  At last
Franklin went on shipboard, thinking the governor had
sent the letters in the ship's letter bag. Before the ship
got to England the bag was opened, and no letters for
Franklin were found. A gentleman now told Franklin that
Keith made a great many such promises, but he never kept
them. Fine clothes do not make a fine gentleman.
So Franklin was left in London without money or
friends. But he got work as a printer, and learned some
things about the business that he could not learn in America.
The English printers drank a great deal of beer.  They
laughed at Franklin because he did not drink beer, and they
called him the " Water American." But he wasn't a fellow
to be afraid of ridicule. They told him that water would
make him weak, but they were surprised to find him able
to lift more than any of thenm.  He was also the strongest
and most expert swimmer of all. In London he kept up his
reading.  He paid a man who kept a secondhand bookstore for permission to read his books.
Franklin came back to Philadelphia as clerk for a merchant; but the merchant soon died, and Franklin went to
work again for his old master, Keimer. He was very useful, for he could mnake ink and cast type when they were
needed, and he also engraved some designs on type metal.
Keimer once fell out with Franklin, and discharged him;
OAbut he begged him to come back when there was some
paper money to be printed, which Keimer could not print
without Franklin's help in making the engravings.

The Great Doctor Franklin.
AFTER a time Franklin started
a printing office of his own. He was
very much in debt for his printing
press and types.  To pay for them
he worked very hard.  Men saw him  
PRINTING PRES8 OF FRANKLIN'S TIME.
at work when they got up in the
morning, and when they went to bed at night the candle
in his office was still shining.  When he wanted paper he
95would sometimes take the wheelbarrow himinself and bring
it from the store at which he bought it to his printing
office.
People began to say: " What an honest, hard-working
young man that Franklin is! He is sure to get on!"  And
then, to help him get on, they brought their work to his
office.
He started a newspaper.  Now his reading of good
books and his practice in writing since he was a little boy
helped him. He could write intelligently on almost any
subject, and his paper was the best one printed in all
America at that time.
Franklin married Miss Deborah Read, the same who
had laughed when she saw him walking the street with a
roll under each arm and his spare clothes in his pockets.
His wife helped him to attend the shop, for he sold stationery in connection with his printing.  They kept no servant,
and Franklin ate his breakfast of plain bread and milk out
of an earthen porringer with a pewter spoon. In time he
paid off all his debts anld began to grow rich.
In those days books were scarce and people had but few
of them.  But everybody bought an almanac.  Franklin
published one of these useful little pamphlets every year.
It was known as "Poor Richard's Almanac," because it
pretended to be written by a poor man named Richard
Saunders, though everybody knew that Richard was Franklin himself. This almanac was very popular on account of
the wise and witty sayings of Poor Richard about saving
time and money.
96Franklin did not spend all his time making money. He
studied hard as usual, and succeeded in learning several
languages without the help of a teacher. This knowledge
was afterwards of the greatest use to him.
Like other people in America at that time, he fbund it
hard to get the books he wanted. To help himself and to
do good to others, he started a public library in Philadelphia, which was the first ever started in America. Many
like it were established in other towns, and the people in
America soon had books within their reach. It was observed, after a while, that plain people in America knew more
than people in the same circumstances in other countries.
Franklin did many other things for the public. Seeing
how wasteful the old fireplaces were, since they burned a
great deal of wood and made the rooms cold
and full of draughts, and often  filled the     _,
house with smoke, he invented a system of
saving heat by means of a small iron fire-              I

school, which afterwards became a great
university.  When the frontier people were

slain by Indians during the French War,
he was the chief man in raising and arming troops for
their relief.
These and other acts of the sort made Franklin well
known in Pennsylvania.  But he presently did one thing
which made him  famous all the world over.  This one
thing was accomplished in a very short time; but it came
from the habits of study he formed when he was a little

experiments, to find out things.  Peo7-...     ple did not know a great deal about
electric*ty at that time. In Europe many learned
~Imen wee trying to find out what they could about
various sorts o  electricity, and lectures on the subject
had been given i Philadelphia. Something made Franklin
think that the el ctricity which was produced by a machine was of the same nature as the lightning in the
sky.  So he devise  a plan to find out. He set a trap
to catch the lightning. He made a kite by stretching a
silk handkerchief on a  ame.  Then he fastened a metal
point to the kite and ti  a hemp string to it to fly it
with.  He thought that i lightning were electricity, it
would go from the metal poin tdown the hemp string.  At
the lower end of the string  e tied a key, and a silk
string to catch hold of, so tha  he should not let the
electricity escape through his hand.
Franklin knew that if a grown ma were seen.t//i
flying a kite he would soon be surroun  d by,/!/
a crowd. So one stormy night he wentut /          -//
and sent up his kite. He waited under a'A
shed to see if the electricity would come.  
When he saw the little fibers of the hemp  1
stand  up  charged with electricity, he held       }i
his hand near the key and felt a shock. a
Then he went home, the only man in    c
the world that knew certainly that light-  
98ning was electricity. When he had found out this secret
he invented the lightning rod, which takes electricity from
the air to the earth anld keeps it from doing harm.
When the learned men of Europe heard that a man
who had hardly ever been at school had made a great discovery, they were struck with wonder, and Franklin was
soon considered one of the great men of the world, and
was called Dr. Franklin.
When the troubles between England and her colonies
began, there was no one so suitable to make peace as
the famous Dr. Franklin.  Franklin went to England and
tried hard to settle matters. But he would not consent to
any plan by which Americans should give up their rights.
When the war broke out Dr. Franklin came home
again.  He was made a member of Congress, and he
helped to make the Declaration of Independence.  After
the Americans had declared themselves independent they
found it a hard task to fight against so powerful a country as England.  They wanted to get some other country
to help them. So Franklin, who was well known in Europe, and who had studied French when he was a poor
printer, was sent to France.
When Franklin went to France he had to appear at the
finest court in the world. But in the midst of all the display and luxury of the French court he wore plain clothes,
and did' noIOt pretend to be anything more than he was in
Philadelphia. This pleased the French, who admired his
independent spirit and called him " the philosopher."  He
persuaded the French Government to give money and
99arms to the Americans.  He fitted out vessels to attack
English ships, and during the whole War of the Revolution
he did much for his country.
When thie war was ended there came the hard task of
making peace. In this Franklin took a leading part.
When peace had been made, Dr. Franklin set out to
leave Paris. As he was old and feeble, the queen's litter,

which was carried by mules, was furnished to him. On
this litter he traveled till he reached the sea.  After he
got home he was the most honored man in America next
to Washington. He became a mnember of the Convention
of I787, which formed the Constitution of the  United
States. He died in I790, at the age of eighty-four.
When Franklin was a boy his father used to repeat to
him Solomon's proverb, " Seest thou a man diligent in his
business? he shall stand before kings." This was always
1 00an encouragement to him, though he did not expect really
to stand before kings. But he was presented to five different kings in his lifetime.

101XVIII.
N   ~Young George Washington.
GEORGE WASHING-?    TON was born in a
plain, old-fashioned,~ =  fhouse in Westmoreland  County, Virginia, on the twenk    ty-second  day  of
February, 1732. He
was sent to,what
was called ani  oldfield school."  The
country   schoolson after" te        houses in Virginia at
WASHINGTON'S FIRST COMMAND  that time were built
in fields too much worn out to grow anything.  Little
George Washington went to a school taught by a man
named Hobby.
In that day the land in Virginia was left to the oldest
son, after the custom in England, for Virginia was an English colony. As George's elder brother Lawrence was to
have the land and be the great gentleman of the family,
he had been sent to England for his education. When he
got back, with many a strange story of England to tell,
George became very proud of him, and Lawrence was
equally pleased with his manly little brother. When Lawrence went away as a captain, in the regiment raised in
I02Amnerica for  service in the  English  army  against the
Spaniards in the West Indies, George began to think
much of a soldier's life, and to drill the boys in Hobby's
school.  There were marches and parades and bloodless
battles fought among the tufts of broom straw in the old
field, and in these young George was captain.
This play-captain  soon came to be a tall boy.  He
could run swiftly, and he
was a powerful wrestler..
The stories of the long
jumps he made are almost
beyond belief.  It was also
said that he could throw            b

is told of'him, He was
so just, that his schoolmates used to bring their quarrels
for him to settle.
When Washington was eleven years old his father
died, but his mother took pains to bring him up with
manly ideas.   He was now  sent to school to a Mr.
Io3Williams, from whom he learned reading, writing, and
arithmetic.  To these were added a little bookkeeping
and surveying.
George took great pains with all he did.  His copybooks have been kept, and they show that his handwriting was very neat.  He also wrote out over one hundred
"rules for behavior in company."  You see that he wished
to be a gentleman in every way.
His brother Lawrence wished George to learn to be
a seaman, and George himself liked the notion of going
to sea. But his mother was unwilling to part with him.
So he stayed at school until he was sixteen years old.
A great deal of the northern part of Virginia at this
time belonged to Lord Fairfax, an eccentric nobleman,
whose estates included many whole counties.  George
Washington must have studied his books of surveying
very carefully, for he was only a large boy when he was
employed to go over beyond the Blue Ridge Mountains
and survey some of the wild lands of Lord Fairfax.
So, when he was just sixteen years old, young Washington accepted the offer of Lord Fairfax, and set out for
the wilderness.  He crossed rough mountains and rode his
horse through swollen streams.  The settlers' beds were
only masses of straw, with, perhaps, a ragged blanket.
But George slept most of the time out under the sky by
a camp fire, with a little hay, straw, or fodder for a bed.
Sometimes men and women and children slept around these
fires, "like cats and dogs," as Washington wrote, "and
happy is he who gets nearest the fire." Once the straw
IO4on which the young surveyor was asleep blazed up, and
he might have been consumed if one of the party had
not waked him  in time.  Washington must have been
a pretty good  surveyor, for he received large pay for his work, earning from  seven to twenty-one dollars a day, at a time when things.'un
were much cheaper than they are
now.
The food of people in the woods
was the flesh of wild turkey and                     very
other game.  Every man was his
own cook, toasting his meat on a
forked  stick, and  eating it off a
chip instead of a plate.  Washing-   TOASTING MEAT BY A CAMP FIRE.
ton led this rough life for three years.  It was a good
school for a soldier. Here, too, he made his first acquaintance with the Indians.  He saw a party of them  dance to
the music of a drum made by stretching deerskin very
tight over the top of a pot half full of water.
They also had a rattle, made by putting
K i'/ \ shot into a gourd.  They took pains to tie
t!i~} *'~  a piece of a horse's tail to the gourd, so as
ILg     to see the horsehair switch to and fro
when the gourd was shaken.
Whlen Washington was but nineteen years old
the governor of Virginia made him  a major of
militia.   He  took lessons in military drill from  an old soldier, and practiced sword exercises under the instruction
I05of a Dutchman   named

people in Virginia and the
other colonies
were  looking
bul   forward to a

French, who

Alleghany Mountains.  The English colonists had spread
over most of the country east of the mountains, and they
were beginning to cross the Alleghanies.  But the French
built forts on the west side of the mountains, and stirred
up the Indians to prevent the English settlers from coming
over into the rich valley of the Ohio River.
The governor of Virginia resolved to send an officer
to warn the French that they were on English ground.
Who was so fit to go on this hard and dangerous errand
as the brave young  Major Washington, who knew  both
the woods and the ways of the Indians?  So Washington
set out with a few hardy frontiersmen. When at length,
after crossing swollen streams and  rough mountains, he
got over to the Ohio River, where all was wilderness, he
called the Indians together and had a big talk with them,
w66at a place called Logtown. He got a chief called "The
Half-king," and some other Indians, to go with him to the
French fort.
The French officers had no notion of giving up their
fort to the English.  They liked this brave and gentlemanly young Major Washington, and entertained him well.
But they tried to get the Half-king and his Indians to
leave Washington, and did what they could to keep him
from  getting safe home again.  With a great deal of
trouble he got his Indians away from the French fort at
last, and started back.  Part of the way they traveled in
canoes, jumping out into the icy water now and then to
lift the canoes over shallow places.
When Washington came to the place where he was to
leave the Indians and recross the mountains, his pack
horses were found to be so weak that they were unfit for
their work.  So Major Washington gave up his saddle
horse to carry the baggage. Then he strapped a pack on
his back, shouldered his gun, and with a man named Gist
set out ahead of the rest of the party.
Washington and Gist had a rascally Indian for guide.
When Washington was tired this fellow wished to carry
his gun for him, but the young major thought the gun
safer in his own hands.  At length, as evening came on,  
the Indian turned suddenly, leveled his gun, and fired on
Washington and Gist, in the dark, but without hitting
either of them.  They seized him before he could reload
his gun. Gist wanted to kill him, but Washington thought
it better to let him go.

and Gist spent the cold night on an island in the river,
and got ashore in the morninog by walking on the ice.
They now stopped at the house of an Indian trader.
Near by was a squaw chief, who was offended that she
had not been asked to the council Washington had held
with the Indians at Logtown.  To make friends, he paid
her a visit, and presented her with a blanket such as the

Washington in the French War.
WHEN Washington got back from the western side of
the mountains, it became evident to the governor of Virginia that the French must be either driven away or the
English people must be shut in to the country on the east
of the mountains.  The people in the colonies did not like
the notion of being fenced in like a lot of cattle in a pasture. So Washington was again sent to the West in I754,
to take possession of the country.   On his first trip  he
had seen the point where the Allegheny [al-le-ga'-ny] and
Monongahela [mo-non'-ga-hee'-lah] rivers meet, which he
thought would be a good place for a fort. A small company of men were sent ahead to build a fort at this place; but
the French drove them away, and planted a fort of their own
on the ground. This was called Fort Duquesne [du-kane'].

Though the
French in America were not many, they
were nearly all soldiers. So when
Washington  with  his party had
got through  the wild mountains
into the western wilderness he found that there were many
more soldiers on the French side than he had. Hearing
that a French party was dogging his steps, he marched
110in the night and surrounded them. After a sharp skirmish
the French fled, but were nearly all captured.  This little
fight was George Washing-,  
ton's first battle.

found that he must retreat     i
or be taken.  He fell back

ington's was the beginning of a great war between England and France.
The next year troops were sent from England under
General Braddock, who set out to drive the French from
Fort Duquesne.  Braddock was a brave man, but one of
the sort who can not learn anything.  He laughed  at
the lank and careless-looking American troops, who cut a
sorry figure alongside of the English with their bright red
I  Icoats and fine drill. He was sure that these rough Americans were of no use.  Even American officers were treated with contempt by the British authorities, and were not
allowed to rank with English officers.  Washington was
so stung by this that he resigned his place, but he accepted a position on Braddock's staff.
Rough as the mountain roads were, Braddock traveled
in a coach as far as he could, and tried to keep up the display common in Europe. He said that the Indians would
not prove formidable when they came to fight his welldrilled English troops. Washington could not persuade the
general to send scouts on either side of his line.  One day
/  there  came  to

by the savages in his absence.  He had then taken to
the woods, and devoted himself to revenging the death
112of his family and to protecting the settlers. He and his
followers lived in the forest, and kept the Indians in constant fear of them.  This Captain Jack, and all his men,
came to General Braddock and offered to help him as
scouts.  But Braddock put all his confidence in his solid
ranks of English soldiers, and he foolishly refused the offer
of the Black Hunter and his men.
As the army drew near to Fort Duquesne, Washington
suggested to the commander that the Virginia rangers
should be sent in front, because they were used to the
woods.  But Braddock was angry to think that a young
American should advise an old British general.
On the 9th of July, I755, as Braddock's army was
marching along the narrow track through the woods, the
Indians and French attacked them. All at once the woods
rang with the wild war cry of the Indians, like the barking of a thousand wild animals. The forest, but a minute
before so silent, was alive with screaming savages. From
every tree and thicket the Indians leveled their rifles at the
red coats of the English, who fell like pigeons under their
fire. Unable to see anybody to shoot at, the English soldiers did not know what to do. The Americans took to
the trees and stumps and returned the fire in Indian fashion, and Washington begged the general to order the British to do the same; but Braddock made them stand up
in line, where they could easily be shot down.
Braddock fought bravely, and fell at length mortally
wounded.  Colonel Washington did his best to rally the
men and save the battle. He had two horses shQt under
II3him, and four bullets went through his coat. The army,
so gay  and  brave in the morning, was soon broken to
pieces, and the men fled back to the settlements.
But Washington had become the hero of the people.
He was now put in chief command of the Virginia troops in
defense of the frontier, and managed affairs well.  In I758
he commanded the foremost division in an expedition under General Forbes, which slowly cut its way through the
rough wilderness of Pennsylvania, and, having at last got
over the mountains, forced the French to leave Fort Duquesne. The fort was rebuilt by the English and renamed
Fort Pitt, in honor of William Pitt, the great prime minister of England, who was a true friend to the Americans.
When a town grew around Fort Pitt it was called Pittsburg.
The war between the English and the French was
finally closed in I763.  Canada, with all the country east
of the Mississippi, was given up to the English, and settlers
soon began to make their way into the region now known
as Kentucky and Tennessee.
Before the war closed Washington retired to his home
at Mount Vernon, and was married to Mrs. Martha Custis,
a widow.

XX.
Washington in the Revolution.
WASHINGTON lived for many years quietly at Mount
Vernon, and he did not intend to have anything more to
do with a soldier's life.  He was fond of hunting and fishing. He sometimes helped to haul a seine in the Potomac
River.  He rode over his large plantation to see that all
went well, and he made maps of all his fields, and kept
his accounts carefully and neatly, as he had always done.
All traveling strangers were sure of welcome at his house,
and the poor, when in danger of suffering, were provided
with corn from his granary.
But, as time went on, the English Parliament tried to
collect a tax from the Americans. The Americans declared
that, so long as they elected no members of Parliament,
that body had no right to tax them without their consent.
But the men who governed in England did not think that
people in the colonies had the same rights as people in
England, so they oppressed the Americans in many ways.
Without asking consent of the colonies, they put a tax on
115all the tea that came into America; and when some of
the tea got to Boston, the people turned Boston Harbor
into one big teapot by pitching the whole shipload of
tea into the water.  The English government resolved to
punish Boston, but the qther colonies took sides with the
people of that town.
In order to make the English government cease their
oppressions, the Americans agreed not to wear clothes
made of English cloth, nor to use anything else brought
from  England.  Washington and other great gentlemen
of that time put on homespun American clothes, which
were coarse, for the Americans had not yet learned how
to make fine goods. American ladies, who were extremely fond of tea, which they drank from pretty little cups
brought from China, now gave up their favorite drink.
Instead of it, they sipped a tea made from the leaves of the
sage plants in their gardens, or from the roots and flowers
of the sassafras. Probably they tried to drink these homegrown teas with cheerful faces, and to make believe that
they liked sage and sassafras as well as the real tea from
China.  It must have been a pleasure to feel that they
were fighting a battle for liberty over their tea tables.
Washington, in his quiet way, was a strong supporter
of liberty against the King of England and the Parliament.
In order to bring all the thirteen colonies to stand by one
another against England a meeting, called a " Congress,"
was appointed in I774, and men were sent from each
colony to attend it.  Washington was a member of this
Congress, which sent a letter to the king, demanding that
ii6117
they should  be allowed  the same liberties as
his subjects in England.
But neither the  King of England nor the
English  Parliament  would  repeal  the  laws
which the Americans disliked.  As the Americans would not obey them, the quarrel grew
hotter, and English troops were sent to bring
k  A    the Americans to  submit.  On the  I9th of
April, 1775, the Revolutionary War was begun  by a battle  at Lexington, near Boston,
MINUTEMAN,.   between British troops and Amrnerican  farmers.
These farmers, who were called "minutemen," drove the
troops back into Boston, firing on them  from  every field
and fence as they retreated.
Seeing that war had begun, Congress'looked about for
a leader.  They remembered the prudent and brave conduct of Colonel George
Washington, when a young
man, in the French  and'
Indian War.  He was chosen
to  be general and  commander
in chief of all the armies of the
colonies.
Before Washington  reached
the army near Boston, the battle
of Bunker Hill had taken place.
In this battle the Americans had

9MORE than four hundred years ago there lived in the
old city of Genoa [gen'-o-ah], in Italy, a workingman who
had four sons.  One of these was Christopher Columbus,
who was born, probably about the year I446, in that part of
the city occupied by the weavers of woolen cloth.  Learned
men have lately taken much pains to find the very house.
It is a narrow house, and dark inside.  The city has bought
it and put an inscription in Latin on the front, which says:
" No house more worthy!  Here, under his
father's roof, Christopher Columbus passed
his boyhood and youth."  The father of
little Christopher was a wool comber
that is, a man who prepared the wool
for the spinners, or, as some say, a
weaver. Christopher learned to work
in wool, like his father.
Ifought so stubbornly against the well-trained English
troops that all America was encouraged.
For many months Washingtoln kept a fine British army
shut up in Boston.  When he was strong enough he
suddenly sent a body of troops to Dorchester Heights,
near Boston, where, by the help of bales of hay, breastworks were built in a single night.  When the English
general saw these works, hle said, " The rebels have done
more in one night than my armny would have done in
one month."  The Americans began to throw shells from
the Dorchester battery into Boston, which soonI became so
uncomfortable a place to stay in that the English army
got into ships and sailed away.
CROSSING THE DELAWARE.
The Americans at first were fighting only to get their
rights as subjects of England.  But since neither the Kingnor the Parliament of England would let them have their
rights, they got tired of calling themselves Englishmen.
They determined to set up an independent government.
On the 4th of July, 1776, Congress declared the colonies
"free and independent."   This
is called the " Declaration
of Independence."

Jersey. It seemed as though all
were lost.  But though his men were too few to fight the
whole English army, Washington felt that he must strike
a blow at some part of it in order to give the Americans courage.  The English people did not like the war
against the Americans, so the king had hired some Hessian soldiers to fight for him.  About a thousand of these
were in Trenton, N. J., while Washington was on the
other side of the Delaware, a little way off.  On Christmas
iignight the Hessians were celebrating the day.  Washington celebrated it ini his own fashion. He took part of his
army, and crossed the Delaware in the midst of floating
ice. There was a severe snowstormn, and two of his men
were frozen to death.  I-He marched quickly to Trenton,
and after a sharp fight he took about a thousand prisoners, as Christmas presents for his country.
Washington got back across the Delaware with his
prisoners, but in a few days he was again in Trenton, where
he came near being surrounded and captured by the English  general Cornwallis.   The
Delaware was so  full of ice
that the Americans could not
get back to the other side of
it, and a strong English force
was pressing upon them in
front.  Something  must  be
done  quickly.  So  at night
Washington had all his camp
fires built up, in order to
deceive the enemy.  He put
a few men to digging in the
trenches, and had them make
as much noise as possible.
Then he took his army silently by a back road around

English in Princeton.  Cornwallis had gone to bed boasting that he "would bag the fox" in the morning; but
when morning came, "the fox" was gone.   Cornwallis
thought at first that the Americans had retreated across
the Delaware, but soon he heard the booming of cannons
away behind him at Princeton; then he knew that Washington  had  outwitted  him.   He had to hasten  back to
New Brunswick to save his stores, while Washington went

The Victory at Yorktown and Washington as President.
IN larger histories you will read of the many battles of
the Revolution, and of the sad sufferings of Washington's
soldiers, who were sometimes obliged to march barefoot,
leaving tracks of blood on the frozen ground. Sometimes
a soldier had to sit by the fire all night for want of a
blanket to cover himself with. There were not many people in this country then, and they were mostly farmers,
with but little money.  They were fighting against England, which was the richest and strongest nation of that
time.  But after a while France sent men and ships to
help the United States to finish the war.
The Revolutionary War lasted about seven years in
all. A great victory which Washington gained when the
war had lasted more than six years really finished the
struggle.
General Cornwallis, the same whom Washington had
fooled when he slipped out of Trenton, had won several
victories over American troops in the Southern States.
But he could not subdue the people, who were always
ready to rise up again when he thought he had conquered
them.  Cornwallis marched northward from Carolina into
Virginia, where he did a great deal of damage.  Washington was in the North watching New York, which was
occupied by English troops. lie thought if he could capture the fine army which Cornwallis commanded in Virginia
he might end the war.
I22So, making every sign that he was going to attack
New York, in order that soldiers might not be sent from
New York to Cornwallis, he marched at the head of the
American and French armies toward the South.  On the
way, he visited his home at Mount Vernon for the first
time in six years.
Soon Cornwallis and his army were shut up in Yorktown, as Washingtont had once been shut up by Cornwallis
in Trenton.  But Cornwallis was not allowed to
escape, as Washington did.  Troops were sent all
around him like a net, to keep him from getting away,
whlile the French ships in Chesapeake Bay kept him from
getting any help by way of the sea. The fighting about
Yorktown was very severe, and the mnost splendid courage was shown by both the American and the French
I23soldiers in charging the redoubts.  The English fought
with the greatest stubbornness on their side.
During the assaults Washington stood where he could
see the bravery of the troops. One of his aides told him
that it was a dangerous place for him to be in.
"If you think so you are at liberty to step back," said
Washington.
Presently a musket ball struck a cannon near him and
rolled at his feet.  General Knox grasped Washington's
arm, and said, "My dear general, we can not spare you
yet."
"It is a spent ball. No harm is done," answered Washington.
Finding he could no longer resist, Cornwallis surrendered, and the war was virtually closed by the taking of
Yorktown.  The people of England had never liked this
oppressive war, and the next year the English government felt obliged to acknowledge the independence of the
United States.
Washington did not seek to make himself a king or a
ruler over the country he had set free. When his work was
over he gladly gave up command of the army, and went
back to become, as he said, "a private citizen on the banks
of the Potomac."  While all the world was praising him,
he went to work again taking care of his lands and crops
at Mount Vernon, with the intention of never leaving his
home for public life again.
But the people soon found that their government was
not strong enough.  Each State was almost a little country,
124by itself, and the nation Washington and others had fought
so hard to set free seemed about to fall into thirteen
pieces. So a convention was called, to meet in Philadelphia in I787, five years after the close of the Revolution. This convention, of which Washington was the
president, made a new Constitution, which should bind all
the States together into one country, under the rule of a
President and Congress.
When the new Constitution had been adopted it became necessary to choose a President. Everybody wanted
Washington to leave his fields and be the first President.
He was elected by almost all the votes cast.
At that time the capital of the country was New York.
There were no railroads or telegraphs, so a messenger had
to be sent from New York to Mount Vernon to tell General Washington that he had been chosen the first President of the United States.  As the general traveled to
New York the people turned out everywhere to do him
honor.  They rode by his carriage, and they welcomed
him with public dinners in the towns.  When he got to
Trenton, out of which he had marched to escape from
Cornwallis and fight the battle of Princeton, he found the
bridge over which he had marched that night beautifully
decorated.  A triumphal arch had been erected by the
women of Trenton, and, as the President passed beneath
it, girls dressed in white sang a song of victory, and
strewed flowers before him.
When he reached Elizabethtown Point there was in
waiting for him a handsome large barge.  In this he was

rowed by thirteen master pilots  
dressed in white, and six other
barges kept him company. The whole city of New York
welcomed him with every possible honor. On the 30th of
April, I789, he took the oath of office, in the presence of
a great throng of people.
Washington was again elected President in I792.  He
refused to be elected a third time, anid, after publishing a
farewell address to the country, he left the presidency in
1797.  He died at Mount Vernon in 1799.

Thomas Jefferson.
THOMAS JEFFERSON was the author of the Declaration
of Independence.  His father was a Virginia planter, and
also a surveyor.  The father was a man of strong frame,
able to stand between two great hogsheads of tobacco
lying on their sides and set both on end at once.   He
lived a hardy life, surveying in the woods.
Thomas Jefferson was born in I743.  His father died
when he was fourteen, and left him  the owner of a large
plantation. Like most Virginia boys, he was fond of hunting, riding, and swimming.  But he did not waste his life
in sport. When he went to college at Williamsburg he
became a famous student.  Sometimes he studied fifteen
hours a day, which would have been too much if he had
I27At this time Genoa was a place of ships and sailors, going
and coming to and from many parts of the world. On the
beach he might have seen the fishermen
launch their boats and spread their curi_  ous pointed sails, such as you see in the
picture. From the wharves of Genoa
he could watch the ships sailing out to
-'  trade in distant lands. I wonder if the
wool-comber's little boy ever dreamed that
he might one day come to be the most famous
of all ship captains, and sail farther away into unknown seas
than any man had ever sailed before.
Columbus was doubtless poor and had to work for his
living. But he must have been studious, for he somehow
got a pretty good education. He learned Latin, he wrote a
good hand, and could draw maps and charts for the use of
sailors, by which last calling he was able to support himself when he came to be a man. At
twenty-four years of age Columbus made
a voyage, but he was at least twenty-,
seven years of age when he finally became
a seaman, and began to acquire that knowledge of sailing which prepared him to make
discoveries. The seamen of that time did not
sail very far. Their voyages were mostly in COLUMBUS LEARNING
TO DRAW MAPS.
the Med-i-ter-ra'-ne-an, and they knew little
of the Atlantic Ocean, which they called " The Sea of
Darkness," because they did not know what was in it or
on the other side of it. They believed that great monsters
2not been strong.  No man in all America, perhaps, was
his superior in knowledge.
While he was a student, the colonies were thrown into
violent excitement by the passage of the Stamp Act in
England. This was a law for taxing the Americans, made
without their consent.  While this excitement was raging,
young Jefferson went into the Virginia Legislature one
day and heard the famous speech of Patrick Henry against
the Stamp Act.
In the midst of his speech Patrick Henry cried out,
"Caesar had his Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell, and
George III-"   At this point everybody thought Henry
was going to threaten the death of George III, who was
King of England and of the colonies. This would have
been treason. So, without waiting for Henry to finish,
some of those who heard him broke into an uproar, crying out, " Treason! treason!"
A  A~   But when they paused, Patd~                          rick Henry finished  by
saying, " George  III
may profit by their example. If thatbetreason, make the most of.:........-":it."  This scene made,-2;,&gt;,,:,"',  w..,  a deep impression on
~ __. ~'~young Jefferson.
MONTICELLO.         Jefferson's wealth was increased by his marriage.  He built him a house which he
called Monticello [mon-te-sel'-lo], meaning, "little mounI28tain," from its situation on a high hill. Jefferson was very
fond of trying new things. He introduced foreign plants
and trees, and he brought in new articles of furniture and
new wvays of building houses.
While yet a young man he was sent to the Virginia
Legislature, and then to Congress.  He strongly favored
the War of the Revolution. John Adams and others tried
to persuade Congress to declare the colonies independent
of England.  At last a committee was appointed to write
the Declaration.  Jefferson was not a great speaker, but
he was a brilliant writer.  He wrote the Declaration of
Independence, and it was signed by the members of Congress on the Fourth of July, I776.
In the Declaration Jefferson had declared that " all
men are created equal." He now set about abolishing some
of the laws which kept men from being equal in this country. In his own State of Virginia much of the land was tied
up so that it could only descend to the oldest son. This
was called the law of entail.  Jefferson got this law abolished, so that a father's land would be more equally divided
among his children.
There were also laws in most of the States which
established some religious denomination as the religion of
the State, and supported it by taxes.  Jefferson got Virginia to pass a law separating the State from the Church,
and making all men equal in regard to their religion.
Jefferson was governor of Virginia during part of the
Revolutionary War, and he had to make great exertions
to defend the State from the British.  The British troops
I29at length marched on Monticello, and Jefferson had to flee
from  his house.
Two of Jefferson's negro slaves, whose names were
Martin and Casar, made haste to hide their master's silver
plate.  They had raised a
plank in  the floor, and
CR nigsar was crouched under the floor hiding the
cani Missilverware   as  Martin
then returnhanded it down to him.
j  ust as the last piece
went down  Martin saw
the  redcoats  approaching.  He dropped  the
plank, l eaving Ccesar a
prisoner. In this uncomfortable place the faithful
fellow lay still for three days
"THE REDCOATS ARE COMING!"  and nights without food.
Jefferson was very loving and tender to his family.  It
was a great sorrow  to him  that four out of his six children died very young.  His wife also died at the close of
the Revolutionary War.
Jefferson was sent to take Franklin's place as American Minister to France.   He'was there five years, and
then returned to America. He had always been kind to
the negroes on his plantation.  When he got back they
were so rejoiced that they took him out of his carriage
and carried him into the house, some of them crying and
13oothers laughing with delight because "massa come home
again.
While Jefferson was gone, the Constitution of the United
States had been adopted and General Washington had been
elected President.  He appointed Jefferson Secretary of
State. Jefferson resigned this office after some years, and
went back to Monticello.
In I796 he was elected Vice President, and in I8oo he
was chosen President of the United States. As President
he introduced a more simple way of living and transacting
business. He was much opposed to pomp and ceremony.
It is said that when he was inaugurated he rode to the
Capitol on horseback and hitched his horse to the fence.
Another account has it that he walked there in company
with a few gentlemen. At any rate, he would have no display, but lived like a simple citizen.
When Jefferson became President the United States
extended only to the Mississippi River.  President Jefferson bought from France a great region west of the Mississippi, larger than all the United States had been before
that time. This is known as the " Louisiana purchase,"
because all the country bought from France was then
called Louisiana.  It has been cut up into many States
since its purchase.
Jefferson was elected President a second time in I804.
In I809 he retired to Monticello, where he lived the remainder of his life.
He was once riding with his grandson when a negro
bowed to them. Jefferson returned the bow, but the boy
I3idid not.  Jefferson turned to his grandson, and said, " Do
you  allow  a poor negro  to  be more  of a gentleman
than you are??   While he was Presi-'"x/.   5   dent, Jefferson was once

not some other gentleman  in the party?"
"I did  not like to  ask  them,  said the old man;
but the old  gentleman there looked like he would do
it, and so I asked him."   He was very much surprised
to learn that it was the President who had carried him
over.
After Jefferson retired from the presidency so many
people desired to see him that his plantation house was
overrun with company, until he was made poor by entertaining those who came.  It is related that one woman even
poked a pane of glass out with her parasol, in order to see
the man who wrote the great Declaration.

John Adams, the second President, and Jefferson, the
third, lived to be very old.   They died on the same day.
Curiously, that day was the 4th of July, I826. If you subtract I776 from I826, you will find that they died exactly
fifty years after the day on which the great Declaration
was signed.   And they were the  two  men  who had the
largest share in the making of the Declaration of Independence.

Daniel Boone.
I/'/,/'WR  1DANIEL BOONE was born in PennY~t/~~~'/~.~.~  sylvania in 1735.  Boone
@...   was a hunter from  the
time he was old enough
to hold a gun to

~:i~_~~ ~ He got just
enough education to know
THE BOY HUNTER.     how to read and write in a
rough way, But in the woods he learned the lessons that
made him the great pioneer
and explorer.,
One day the boy did,
not return from                     his
hunting. The neigh-                     ph
bors searched sev-,i,/ {
eral days before
they found him.                               /
He had built a "
little cabin of sod -%
and boughs. Skins
of  animals  were   _     1~         ~     "drying around the hut, -',-:''"&lt;t   -TRYING TO BE A SAVAGE.
and the young half-sav-   "~'~
age was toasting a piece of meat before the fire.  This
love for the wilderness was the ruling passion of his life.
134By the time Daniel was thirteen the part of Pennsylvania in which he lived had become settled.  The Boones,
like true backwoodsmen, moved to a wilder region on the
Yadkin River, in North Carolina.  While Daniel's father
and brothers cleared a new farm, the boy hunter was left
to supply the table with meat.
One of Boone's modes of hunting was by "shining
deer," as it was called in that country-that is, hunting
deer at night with torches, and killing them by shooting
at their glistening eyes. One night Boone, hunting in this
fashion, saw a pair of eyes shining in the dark which he
thought to be deer's eyes, but which proved to be those of
a neighbor's daughter, whom Boone afterwards married.
As the country was settling, he moved on to the headwaters of the river, where he and his young wife set up
their log cabin in the lonesome wilderness. At this time
the Alleghany Mountains formed a great wall, beyond
which was a vast wilderness, with no inhabitants but Indians and wild animals. (See map, page IIO.) Boone was
too fond of wild life and too daring not to wish to take a
peep over the mountains and get a sight of the land on
the other side.  Fifteen years before the Revolutionary
War began, he pushed across the mountain wall and hunted bears in what is now Tennessee.
In I769 he went into Kentucky with five others.  Here
he hunted the buffalo for the first time, and came near being
run down by a herd of them.  At length he and a man
named Stewart were taken captive by the Indians. Boone
pretended to be very cheerful.  When he had been seven
I35days in captivity, the Indians, having eaten a hearty supper, all fell into a sound sleep.  Boone sat up.  One of
the Indians moved.  Boone lay down again.  After a while
he rose up
once  more.
As the Indians all lay
still, he wakOne1i~ day, when Booe           ned  St ewStew'}a  ~~~~1 ~~~art, and they

they   never
found any trace of the four men who had crossed the
Alleghanies with them.
One day, when Boone and Stewart were hunting, a lot
of arrows were shot out of a canebrake near them, and
Stewart fell dead. Boone's brother and another man had
come from North Carolina to find Daniel.  The other man
walked out one day and was eaten up by wolves. There
were now only the two Boones left of eight men in all who
had crossed the mountains.
By this time Boone ought to have had enough of the
136wilderness. But the fearless Daniel sent his brother back
to North Carolina for ammunition and horses, while he
spent the winter in this almost boundless forest, with no
neighbors but Indians, wolves, and other wild creatures.
This was just what Daniel Boone liked, for he was himself a wild man.
Once the Indians chased him.  Seeing them at a distance, following his tracks like dogs after a deer, he
caught hold of one of those long, wild grapevines that
dangle from the tall trees in Kentucky, and swung himself away out in the air and then dropped down. When
the Indians came to the place they could not follow his
tracks, and Boone got away.
He lived alone three months, till his brother returned.
Then the Boones selected a spot on which to settle, and
went back to North Carolina for their families and their
friends. On their way out again, in I773, the Indians attacked Boone's party and killed six men, among whom
was Boone's eldest son. The women of the party now
went to the nearest settlement, but Boone made several journeys to and fro.  In I775, just as the Revolutionary War broke out, he built a fort in Kentucky, and
called it Boonesborough.  Even while building the fort
Boone and his friends were attacked by Indians.  When
the fort was completed, Boone's wife and daughters came
to Boonesborough, and they were the first white women
in Kentucky.
A daughter of Boone's and two other girls were captured by the Indians while picking flowers outside of the
137swam in the ocean, and that in one part it was so hot
that the water boiled.
Of course, they did not know that there was any such
place as America, and they believed that Africa reached
clear to the south pole. The only trade
they had with Asia was by caravans, which
brought silks, gums, spices, and precious
stones from the far East on the backs
of camels.
While Columbus was yet a little
boy, there was living in Portugal
[poar'-tu-gal] a prince named Henry,
the son of the king of that country.       w  
Henry  was a  learned  man,  who
thought he could find a way to get

Asia.  He sent out ship after ship, until he had discovered much of the African coast.
It was probably the fame of these voyages that drew
Columbus to Portugal.  From  Portugal Columbus himself
sailed down the newly discovered coast of Africa.  Then
he went north beyond England, so that he was already a
very great traveler for the time.
While the Portuguese [poar'-tu-gueze], in trying to get
to India, were creeping timidly down the coast of Africa,
with land always in sight, Christopher Columbus conceived
a new and far bolder plan. As learned men believed the
world round, he proposed to sail straight west to Asia,
braving all the dangers of the unknown Atlantic.  He

and then, so as to guide their fathers in'~ -,  /;    following  them.  The  party  was

and the girls were rescued.
To tell of all the battles
around  Boonesborough, or of
all of Daniel Boone's fights and
escapes  would  take a great
part of this book.  Once, when
on ~   ~~hunting, he encountered two? Indians. He" treed," as they
/~  ~  called it-that is, he got behind one of the large trees
a hand-t-had ft  of the forest.  The Indians
did the same.  Boone partly
wtexposed himself, and one of
BACKOOD GIthe Indians fired, but Boone,
Oe   BdaCW  who was very quick, dodged at
the flash of the Indian's gun.  He played the same trick
on the other.  Then he shot one of the Indians, and had
a hand-to-hand fight with the other.  The Indian struck
at him with his tomahawk, but Boone protected himself
with his gun barrel, and killed the Indian with a knife
such as hunters of that time carried in their belts.
One day Boone was attacked by a hundred savages.
He tried the speed of his legs, but one young Indian
was swifter than he, and he was captured.  The Indians
138thought him a great prize.  They shaved his head, leaving a single lock, painted his face, and dressed him up
like an Inldian.  Then they gave him to an old woman
who had lost her son.  She had her choice to adopt him
or give him  up to be burned alive. After looking at him
a long time the squaw made up
her mind to adopt him.
The Indians among whom Boone
was a prisoner were fighting on the  
English  side  in  the  Revolution.
The English officers who were then
at Detroit bought all their captives
from the Indianis, except Boone, and            /
they offered five hundred dollars for        i;
Captain Boone.  But the Indians          N11
would not sell so great a warrior.
The English officers were sorry for  
him, and out of real kindness, when
they could not buy him, they offered    
him  money.  Boone refused to re-,/
ceive any favors from  those who         -;were fighting against his country.      DANIEL BOONE.
He pretended to like the Indian way of living.  He
stayed a long time with them, and took part in all their
sports.  He seemed to have forgotten his own people..
But when he found that they were preparing to attack
Boonesborough, he got ready to escape.  Pretending to
chase a deer, while holding a piece of his breakfast in his
hand, he succeeded in getting away. By running in streams
I39of water he kept the Indians from following his tracks.
He lived on roots and berries, and only once ventured to
discharge his gun to get food.
When he got back to Boonesborough he found that
his family had given him up for dead and gone back to
North Carolina.   He repaired the fort, and beat off five
hundred Indians who attacked it.
Boone brought his family to Kentucky again, and was
in many severe fights after this.   Kentucky had no rest
from bloodshed until Wayne defeated the Indians in Ohio,
in I794. (See page I46.) When Kentucky had filled up
with people, the old pioneer went off to Missouri so as to
get "elbowroom." The amusements of his old age were
lying in wait for deer, shooting wild turkeys, and hunting
for bee trees. He was eighty-five years old when he died.

Robert Fulton and the Steamboat.
MORE than a hundred years ago a sickly Scotch boy
named James Watt used to sit and watch the lid of his
mother's teakettle as it rose and fell while the water was
boiling, and wonder about the power of steam, which
caused this rattling motion.  In hlis day there were no
steamboats, or steam mills, or railways. There was nothing but a clumsy steam engine, that could work slowly anl
up-and-down pump to take water out of mines.  This had
been invented sixty years before. Watt became a maker
of mathematical instruments.  He was once called to repair one of these wheezy, old-fashioned pumping engines.
He went to work to improve it, and he became the real
inventor of the first steam enginle that was good for all
sorts of work that the world wants done.
When once steam was put to work, men said, "Why
not make it run a boat?"  One English inventor tried to
run his boat by making the engine push through the water
a thing somewhat like a duck's foot. An American named
Rumsey moved his boat by forcing a stream of water
through it, drawing it in at the bow and pushing it out
at the stern. But this pump boat failed.
Then came John Fitch.  He was an ingenious, poor
fellow, who had kntocked about in the world making buttons out of old brass kettles, and mending guns. He had
been a soldier in the Revolution and a captive among the
Indians.  At length he made a steamboat.  He did not
I4rimitate the duck's foot or the steam pump, but, like most
other inventors, he borrowed from what had been used.
He made his engine drive,~'~.:..','-~ a number of oars, so....:-:~,,,,,.. -~-~~~--,,  _:.as to paddle the boat

the boat ran but slowly. Fitch grew extremely poor and ragged, but he used
to say that, when " Johnny Fitch" should be forgotten,
steamboats would run up the rivers and across the sea.
This made the people laugh, for they thought him whlat
we call " a crank."
Robert Fulton was born in Pennsylvania in I765. He
was the son of an Irish tailor. He was not fond of books,
but he was ingenious.  He made pencils for his own use
out of lead, and he made rockets for his own Fourth of
July celebration.
With some other boys he
used to go fishing

I42cranks, something like those in the picture. He was fourteen years old when he made this invention.
At seventeen he became a miniature painter in Philadelphia, and by the time he was twenty-one he had earned
money enough to buy a little farm for his mother. He
then went to Europe to study art.
But his mind turned to mechanical inventions, of which
he now made several.  Among other things, he contrived
a little boat to run under water and blow up war vessels;
but, though he could supply this boat with air, he could
not get it to run swiftly.
He now formed a partnership with Chancellor Livingston, the American Minister to France, who was very much
interested in steamboats. Fulton had two plans. One was
to use paddles in a new way; the other was to use the
paddle wheel, such as he had made when he was a boy.
He found the wheels better than paddles.
He built his first steamboat on the River Seine, near
Paris, but the boat broke in two from the weight of her
machinery. His next boat made a trial trip in sight of a
great crowd of Parisians.  She ran slowly, but Fulton felt
sure that he knew just what was needed to make the next
one run faster.
Fulton and Livingston both returned to America. Fulton ordered from James Watt a new engine, to be made
according to his own plans.  In August, 1807, Fulton's
new boat, the Clermont, was finished at New York. People felt no more confidence in it than we do now in a
flying machine. They called it " Fulton's Folly." How143ever, a great many people gathered to see the trial trip
and laugh at Fulton and his failure.  The crowd was
struck with wonder at seeing the black smoke rushing
from the pipes, and the revolving paddle wheels, which
were uncovered, as you see in the picture, throwing spray
into the air, while the boat
_     -.&gt; moved  without spreading
her  sails.  At last  a
-N   ~ steamboat   had   been

bany. When the men
on the river sloops first saw this creature of fire and
smoke coming near them in the night, and heard the puff
of her steam, the clank of her machinery, and the splash
of her wheels, they were frightened.  Some of the sailors
ran below to escape the monster, some fell on their knees
and prayed, while others hurried ashore.
While Fulton was inventing and building steamboats,
people became very much interested in machinery. A man
named Redheffer pretended to have invented a perpetualmotion machine, which, once started, would go of itself.
People paid a dollar apiece to see the wonder, and learned
men who saw it could not account for its motion. Fulton
was aware that it must be a humbug, because he knew
that there could be no such thing as a machine that
144would run of itself. But his friends coaxed him to go to
see it. When Fulton had listened to it awhile he found
that it ran in an irregular way, faster and then slower,
and then faster and slower again.
"This is a crank motion," he said.  "If you people will
help me, I'll show you the cheat."
The crowd agreed to help. Fulton knocked down some
little strips of wood, and found a string running through
one of them  from  the machine to the wall; he followed
this through the upper floor until he came to a back garret. In this sat a wretched old man, who wore an immense beard, and appeared to have been long imprisoned.
He was gnawing a crust of bread, and turning a crank
which was connected with the machinery by the string.
When the crowd got back to the machine room Redheffer
had run away.
Fulton died in I8i5. Before his death many steamboats
were in use. Some years after his death steam was applied
to railways, and a little later steamers were built to cross
the ocean.

William Henry Harrison.
ONE of the members of Congress who signed the Declaration of Independence in I776 was Benjamin Harrison,
a stout and jolly man. When Congress chose John Hancock for its President, or chairman, Hancock made a modest speech, as though he would decline the place.  But
Benjamin Harrison just took him up in his arms and set
him down in the chair.
The third son of this Benjamin Harrison was William
Henry Harrison.  He was born in Virginia in I773. His
father died when he was young. Young Harrison began
the study of medicine, but there was a war with the Indians in the West, and he wanted to go to the war. His
guardian wished him to stick to his study of medicine;
but there was more soldier than doctor in Harrison, and
President Washington, who had been his father's friend,
made the young man an officer in the army when he was
but nineteen years old.
When Harrison got to the western country the army,
under the lead of General St. Clair, had been surprised by
the Indians and defeated. Washington appointed General
Wayne to take St. Clair's place, and Wayne gave Harrison
a place on his staff. Wayne trained his men carefully, and
practiced them in shooting, and when he marched it was
with every care not to be surprised.  The Indians called
Wayne "the Chief who never Sleeps." He fought a battle
with the Indians on the Maumee River, in Ohio, and he
I46pushed them so hotly with bayonets and guns fired at short
range that the Indians fled in every direction. They were
so thoroughly beaten that they made peace with the white
people, and the Western settlers had rest from war for a
while.
In I8oI a new Territory, called Indiana, was formed.
It took in all the country which now lies in Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin, and it had but few white people in it.
Harrison was made governor of this large region.
There was a young Shawnee warrior, Tecumseh [tecum'-seh], who had fought against Wayne in I794. He
was much opposed to the Indians' selling their lands.
He declared that no tribe had a right to sell land
without the consent of the other tribes. There were at
that time seventeen States, and the Indians called the
United States the" Seventeen Fires."  Tecumseh got the
notion of forming all the Indian tribes into a confederacy like the " Seventeen Fires," or States, of the white
men.
Tecumseh was not born a chief, but he had gathered
a great band of followers, and had thus become a powerful leader.  He made long journeys to the North and
West, and then traveled away to the South to bring the
Indians into his plan for a great war that should drive
the white people back across the Alleghany Mountains.
In one council at the South the Indians refused to join
him.  Tecumseh told them  that, when he got to Detroit, he would stamp on the ground and make the
houses in their village fall down.  It happened soon after
I47thought the world much smaller than it is, and he supposed
that he should find Asia about as far west of Europe as
America is.  He did not dream of finding a new world.
As Portugal was the leading country in making discoveries, Columbus first proposed to find this new way
to Asia for the king of that country. If the good Prince
Henry had been alive, he would probably have adopted
the plan with joy.  But " Henry the Navigator," as he
was called, had died long before, and the advisers of the
Kifig of Portugal ridiculed the plan, and laughed at the
large reward which Columbus demanded if he should succeed.  However, the king secretly sent out one of his own
vessels, which sailed westward a little way, and then came
back and reported that there was no land there.,  When
Columbus heard of this,.he left Portugal, not
liking to be cheated in this way.
He went to Spain and appeared at
court, a poor and friendless stranger.
"/?,~~ r  Spain was ruled at this time by King, Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. They;:   were very busy in their war with the

king and queen paid little heed to the projects of this foreigner.  They were too much employed with battles and
sieges to attend to plans for finding a new way to India.
Most of those who heard of Columbus ridiculed his
plans.  They did not believe that people could live on the
4that an earthquake did destroy some of their houses, and
the frightened Indians said, " Tecumseh has arrived at Detroit." They immediately got ready to help him against
the white people.
Tecumseh had a brother who pretended to be a prophet,
and who was called "The Open Door."   He gathered
many Indians about him at Tippecanoe, in Indiana, and he
preached a war against the white people.
Governor Harrison held a council with Tecumseh at
Vincennes. Seats were placed for the chief on the piazza
of the governor's house, but Tecumseh insisted on holding
the council in a
grove.  He said

WITH TECUMSEH,   In the discusAT VINCENNES.    sions Tecumseh
grew very angry, and his warriors seized their tomahawks
and sprang to their feet.   Harrison drew  his sword, a
white man near him showed a dirk, and a friendly Indian
cocked his pistol to defend the governor, while a MethodI48ist minister ran with a gun to protect Harrison's family.
Others present armed themselves with clubs and brickbats. The soldiers now came running up to fire on the
Indians; but Harrison stopped them, and told Tecumseh
that he was a bad man, and that he could now go.
Tecumseh cooled down and had another talk with the
governor the next day, and Harrison even went to the
chief's tent with only one companion.
But General Harrison soon saw that, in spite of all he
could do, war would come.  Tecumseh went South to stir
up the Southern tribes.  He gave these far-away Indians
bundles of sticks painted red. He told them
to throw away one stick every day, and,  
when all were gone, they were to fall
upon the white people.
But General Harrison thought, if
there had to be war, he would rather

fix the time for it himself; so, while
Tecumseh was leaving his almanac of red sticks in the
South, the general marched from Vincennes [vin-senz'], up
the Wabash [waw'-bash] to Tippecanoe [tip'-pe-ka-noo'],
which was Tecumseh's home.  Knowing that the Indians
would try to surprise him, he fooled them into believing
that he was going up on one side of the river, and then
crossed to the other.  He got nearly to Tippecanoe in
safety, but the prophet sent messengers to him, pretending
that the Indians would make peace the next day.
Harrison's men lay on their arms that night.  About
four o'clock on the morning of November 7, I8ii, the
II
I49general was pulling on his boots, intending to awaken the
army, when a sentinel fired at a skulking Indian, and the
war whoop sounded from the tall grass on every side.

But many an Indian and
many a white man fell in that bloody struggle.  When
daylight came, Harrison'smen made a charge which drove
away the savages.
Harrison burned the village of Tippecanoe, and Tecumseh came back to find his plan for driving the white men
over the mountains spoiled. But the war with England
broke out soon after this, and Tecumseh entered the British army, and was made a brigadier general.
General Harrison was now once more opposed to TeI
I50cumseh, for he was put in command of the United States
army in the West.  In I8I3 he was besieged in Fort Meigs
[megs] by an English army under General Proctor and a
body of Indians under Tecumseh.
While the English were building their batteries to fire
into the fort, the Americans were very busy also, but they
kept a row of tents standing to hide what they were doing.
When the English guns were ready, the Americans took
down their tents and showed a great earthwork that would
shelter them  from  the batteries.  This made Tecumseh
angry. He said that General Harrison was like a ground
hog-he stayed in his hole, and would not come out and
fight like a man.
Proctor, though belonging to a civilized nation, was a
heartless brute. Tecumseh was born a savage, but he was
always opposed to cruelty. Some of Harrison's men had
been captured, and Proctor allowed the Indians to put
them to death. When Tecumseh saw what was going on,
he rushed in between the Indians and their prisoners with
his tomahawk in hand, and stopped the slaughter.
"Why did you allow this?" he demanded of General
Proctor.
I could not control the Indians," said Proctor.
"Go home and put on petticoats," said Tecumseh.
The English fleet on Lake Erie was beaten in a fight
with the American ships under Commod6re Perry in the
fall of I813.  Harrison now crossed into Canada, and the
British army retreated to the river Thames [temz], where
Harrison overtook it, and a battle followed. Proctor was
151afraid to fall
into the hands
of the Americans,    who
A whated him  for
his cruelties to
prisoners and
the wounded.
He ran away
before the battle was over.
Brave Tecumseh was killed
in this fight.
Harrison left the army soon after this.   In I84o he was
living in a simple way on his farm  at North  Bend, in Ohio,
when he was nominated for President of the United States.
He was elected, but he died on the 4th of April, i84I, one
month after taking office.

Andrew Jackson.
GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON'S father was also named
Andrew Jackson. He was an Irishman, who came to the
Waxhaw settlement, on the line between North and South
Carolina, about ten years before the Revolution. He had
built a log cabin, cleared a little land, and raised a crop of
corn, when he sickened and died. In this sad time his son,
Andrew Jackson, was born. Andrew's mother lived with
her relatives, and spun flax to earn a little money.
From a little fellow "Andy" was a hot-tempered boy.
Some larger boys once loaded a gun very heavily, and
gave it to Andy to fire, in order to see him knocked over
by the " kick" of the gun. But the fierce little fellow
had no sooner tumbled over, than he got up and vowed
that he would kill the first one that laughed, and not one
of the boys dared to provoke him.        -
He grew up in a wild country and
among - rough people.   What little      _ (
schooling he got was at an old-field        /
schoolhouse.  
When he was but thirteen the
Revolutionary War began.  In the      
South the struggle was very bitter,
neighbor battling  against neighbor
with  any weapons that could  be
found.  Of course, a fiery, fellow like
Andrew wanted to have a hand inA 14A

j[S5the fight against England. Whenever he went to a blacksmith's shop he hammered out some new weapon. Young
as he was, he was in two or three skirmishes.  In one of
these, Andrew and his brother were taken prisoners.  A
British officer ordered Andrew,~  ~=~~:=    to clean the mud off his boots.
Young Jackson refused, and got a
sword cut on his head for it. His
viOiSy i ~i       brother was treated in the same
a.t t~'way. The two wounded boys
were then confined in a forv   lorn prison pen, where they
took the smallpox.  Their
mother managed to get them
exchanged, and brought the
this time many settlers were:,,&lt; 4~crossing the mountains into the
rich lands to the westward, and
young Jackson moved to the newly settled country of
Tennessee. Here, in the fierce disputes of a new country, it took a great deal of courage to practice law.
Jackson was not only brave; he was also a quick-tempered man, who got into many quarrels during his life, and
sometimes fought duels. The rough people among whom
154he lived were afraid of him. One day he was eating at a
long table which the keeper of the tavern had set out of
doors for the crowd that had come to see a horse race.
A fight was going on at the other end of the table; but
fights were so common in this new country that Jackson
did not stop eating to find out what it was about. Presently he heard that a friend of his, one Patten Anderson,
was likely to be killed. Jackson could not easily get to
his friend for the crowd, but he jumped up on the table
and ran along on it, putting his hand into his pocket as
though to draw a pistol. He cried out at the same time,
" I'm coming, Patten!" and he opened and shut the tobacco box in his pocket with a sound like the cocking of
a pistol. The crowd was so afraid of him that they scattered at once, crying, " Don't fire!
Jackson was an able man, and an honest one in his way.
He was once a judge, he kept a store, he went to Congress, and then to the United States Senate. When the
"War of I812" with England broke out he was sent as a
general of Tennessee volunteers to defend New Orleans.
When he had waited some time at Natchez he was ordered to disband his troops, as they were not needed.
Those who sent such an order from Washington did not
stop to ask how the poor Tennesseeans were to make their
way back to their homes.  Jackson refused to obey the
order, pledged his own property to get food for his men,
and marched them to Tennessee again. The men became
devoted to him, and gave him the nickname of "Old
Hickory."
1 5  But after a while war broke out in the Southwest in
earnest. Tecumseh, in his Southern trip, had persuaded a
half-breed chief, who was known to the whites as Weathersford and to the Indians as Red
Eagle, to " take up the hatchet"
and go to war. The Indians attacked Fort Mimms, in which four
hundred men, women, and children
were shut up.  They burned the
fort and killed the people in it.
Weathersford  tried  to  stop  the
massacre, but he could not control his savages.
When the news of this slaughCHIeF Ibl F nd ter  reached  Tennessee  Jackson

was very ill from a wound in the
arm  and a ball in the shoulder which he got in a foolish
fight. But in spite of his wounds, the fiery general marched
at the head of twenty-five hundred  men  to  attack  the
savages. He had a great deal of trouble to feed his troops
in the wilderness; the men suffered from hunger, and sometimes rebelled and resolved to go home.  Jackson once
ordered out half his army to keep the other half from leaving. Again, the half that had tried to desert was used to
make the others stay. At another time he stood in the road
in front of his rebellious soldiers, and declared in the most
dreadful words that he would shoot the first villain who
took a step.
In spite of all these troubles with his wild soldiers, JackI56son beat the enemy by rapid marches and bold attacks.
In I814 the savages had fortified themselves at a place
called  Horseshoe  Bend.  Here Jackson  had   I  
a  terrible  battle   
with the Indians
who fought until  b
they were almost           i  t
all dead. At length                             m
most of the savages submitted, or
fled into Florida,
which at that time
belonged to Spain.
The  white  men
had vowed to kill
Weathersford, the
chief;  but  that
fearless fellow rode
up  to Jackson s
tent, and said that A'~'

for  the  Indian
women and children, who were starving in the woods.
When the white soldiers saw Weathersford, they cried
out, "Kill him!"   But Jackson told them  that anybody
who would kill so brave a man would rob the dead.
Jackson was suffering all this time from a painful illness,
and was hardly able to sit in the saddle. But he marched

with their feet up and their heads
down.  The very children tapped
their  foreheads  when  Columbus
passed, to signify their belief that
the fellow was crazy.
In I49I Columbus, whose plans
were at last rejected, left the court,'
traveling on foot like the poor
man that he was, and leading his, little boy by the hand.  He
/ stopped one day at the convent of La Rabida [lah rab'e-dah] to beg a little bread
and water for the child. Tihe
good prior of the convent, hap-; pening to pass at that moment,'was struck with the foreign
accent of the stranger's
speech.'Hie began to
3-..  talk with him, and soon;/"~~,~ ~_I-    -    learned of the
project that had
so long filled the mind of Columbus. The prior
was deeply interested.  He had once
been the confessor, or religious adviser,
of Isabella and he now wrote the queen
a letter in favor of the plan of Columbus.  The queen sent for the prior, and
2
5to Mobile, which he succeeded in defending against
an English force that had
landed in Florida, and had
been joined by Florida
Indians. Jackson resolved
that the Spaniards should
not give any further aid to the enemies of the United
States.  He therefore marched his army into Florida and
took the Spanish town of Pensacola, driving the English
away.
It soon became necessary for him to go to New Orleanls to defend that place.  The English landed twelve
thousand fine men below that city.  Jackson armed the free
negroes and the prisoners out of the jails, but, after all, he
had only half as many soldiers as the English. The general,
i58though yellow with illness, was as resolute as ever. He had
several fights with the English as they advanced, but the
decisive battle was fought on the 8th of January, I8i5, when
the English tried to carry the American works by storm.
Jackson's Southwestern troops were many  
of them dead shots. They mowed down              1  f

was also dead.  Though the                         l i'
English  had lost twenty-six  
hundred brave men, the Amer-   ~                  I  
icans had but eight killed and
thirteen wounded.  
One little English bugler,
fourteen years old, had climbed
into a tree near the American   t.,  
works and  blown  his bugle

till there were none left to
blow for. An American soldier "       X    )(

where the men made much of their  
young prisoner, because he was so brave.  
This wonderful defense of New Orleans ended the
"War of I812."  General Jackson became the darling of
his country.  When the United States bought Florida from
Spain, he was sent to take possession of that country.
I59In I828 Jackson was elected President of the United
States. He was a man of the plain people, rough in speech
and stern in manner, but his popularity was very great.
He was the first President who put out of office those who
had voted against him, and appointed his own friends to
their places. He enforced the laws with a strong hand,
and he managed affairs with other nations in such a way
as to make the country respected in Europe.
General Jackson died in I1845.   He was, as we have
seen, a man of strong will and fierce passions.  But he was
faithful to his friends, affectionate with his relatives, and
exceedingly kind to his slaves.   He had no children, but
he adopted a nephew of his wife and brought him up as
his son.   He also adopted an Indian baby, found after one
of his battles in its dead mother's arms. His splendid defense of New Orleans showed Jackson to be one of the
very ablest generals America has ever produced.

Morse and the Telegraph.
BEFORE the railroad and the telegraph were invented
it took weeks for news to go from one part of this country
to another. The mails were carried by a lad on horseback,
or by a stagecoach drawn by horses.  The railroad was
invented in England and introduced into this country about
I830. The locomotive carried news much more quickly
than horses' feet could travel.  But now we know to-day
what happened yesterday on the other side of the world,
and we wonder how people ever got on without the
electric telegraph.
Samuel Finley Breeze Morse, who invented the electric
telegraph, or that form of it that came into general use,
was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, in I791.  When
he was four years old he was sent to school to an old
lady, who was lame and not able to leave her chair.  She
managed her scholars with a very long rattan stick. This
was her telegraph, we might say, but the children did not
always like the messages she sent upon it. Morse showed
i6ihis talent as an artist by scratching a picture of the old
lady on a piece of furniture, but he did not like the message she sent him on her rattan telegraph.
When Samuel Morse went to Yale College he took
great interest in the experiments in electricity which he
saw there.  But the chief question with him at this time
was how to get a living.  He had a talent for making
pictures, and he took to painting miniatures of people for
five dollars apiece; he also made profiles at a dollar apiece.
As there were no photographs then, people who wanted
small pictures of themselves had to have them painted.
This was usually done on ivory.
We have seen that Fulton, the maker of steamboats, was
a painter.  Morse became a painter, and went to England
to study, where he attracted attention by his good work.
After four years in Europe he came to America again, as
poor as ever. His clothes were threadbare, and his shoes
were ragged at the toes. " My stockings," he said, "want
to see my mother." He brought with him a large picture,
which everybody admired, but nobody bought it.
He was already thinking about inventions. He and his
brother invented a pump, which his brother jokingly named
"Morse's Patent Metallic, Double-headed, Ocean-drinker
and Deluge-spouter Valve Pump Box." But the pump, for
all this, was not a success, and Morse traveled from town
to town painting portraits for a living.
Morse went to Europe again, and in 1832 he sailed for
America once more.  He was now about forty-one years
old. One evening, in the cabin of the ship, the talk turned
i62on electricity.  A Dr. Jackson, who was one of the passengers, told of an interesting experiment which he had
seen in Paris.  Electricity had been sent instantaneously
through a great length of wire arranged in circles around
a large room.
Then," said Morse, " I don't see why messages can
not be sent a long distance instantaneously by means of
electricity."
When the conversation was over the rest forgot all
about it.  But Morse began to plan a telegraph, making
drawings of the machine in his sketch-book.  But he was
much too poor to go on with his invention. His brothers
gave him the use of a room for a studio, and here he lived,
and made experiments on a rude telegraph.  He did his
own cooking, and he used to go out at night to buy food,
for fear that his friends should discover how little he had
to eat.
In I835 Morse became a professor.  He now took a
Professor Gale into partnership in the telegraph.  But
neither of them had money enough to perfect the invention.  While they were one day exhibiting their rude machine to some gentlemen, a student named Alfred Vail
happened to come into the room.  Young Vail was the son
of Judge Vail, a wealthy mill owner. He had worked for
some years in his father's shops, and was a far better
mechanic than Professor Morse or Professor Gale.
Vail's quick eye soon comprehended the new invention,
which was being tested with seventeen hundred feet of
wire stretched back and forth across the room.
i63"Do you intend to try the telegraph on a large scale?'
Vail asked.
"I do, if I can get the money to carry out my plans,"
Professor Morse replied.
Vail then proposed to get money for Morse if the professor would make him a partner. This was agreed to, and
the young man hurried to his room, locked the door, threw
himself on his bed, and gave himself up to imagining the
future of the telegraph. He took up his atlas and traced
out the great lines which the telegraph would take. It is
probable that Professor Morse would have failed if it had
not been for the help of this young man.
After getting some further explanations from  Morse,
Alfred Vail hurried home and talked to his father about
it, until the judge decided to furnish the two thousand
dollars that would be needed to make a perfect telegraph.
This was to be taken to Congress, to persuade that body
to supply money to build the first line.
Besides furnishing money for the machine, the Vails got
Morse to paint some portraits for them, and thus supplied
him with money to meet his most pressing wants. Alfred
now had a room fitted up in one of his father's workshops
at Speedwell, in New Jersey.  He kept the place carefully
locked, lest the secret of the invention should be discovered by others.
A boy named William  Baxter, fifteen years old, was
taken from the shop to help Alfred Vail. For many months
Alfred and Baxter worked together, sometimes day and
night. There was no such thing as telegraph wire in a
i64day  when  there were no telegraphs.   But the ladies of
that time wore a kind of high bonnet, which was called a
"sky-scraper," and a sort of wire was used to strengthen
and stiffe.n the fronts of such bonnets, which
proved to be the best to be had for the pur- /  
pose of the new telegraph makers. Vail bought  \,
all the bonnet wire in the market.             j    i
Vail  made  many  improvements  in
Morse's machine.  He also made the instru-: {

XXVIII.
How the Telegraph became successful.
MORSE now had but three pupils.  One of his pupils,
when his quarter's tuition was due, had not yet received his
money from home, so that he could not pay the professor
immediately.   One day, when Morse came in, he said:
"Well, Strother, my boy, how are we off for money?"
Professor, I'mn sorry to say I have been disappointed,
but I expect the money next week."
Next week!" exclaimed Morse; "I shall be dead by
next week."
Dead, sir?"
"Yes, dead of starvation."
Would ten dollars be of any service?" asked Strother,
in alarm.
"Ten dollars would save my life; that is all it would
do," answered the professor, who had not eaten a mouthful for twenty-four hours. The money was paid.
Judge Vail grew discouraged about the telegraph. The
old gentleman refused to look at the machine.  Alfred Vail
saw that if the work were not finished soon his father
would put a stop to it.  He and young Baxter stayed
i66close in their room, with Morse, working as fast as they
could, and avoiding Judge Vail, lest he should say the
words that would end their project.  Baxter would watch
the windows, and, when he saw Judge Vail go to dinner, he would tell Morse and Alfred Vail, and they would
all go to dinner at the house of Alfred's brother-in-law,
making sure to get safe back before the judge should
appear again.
At last the invention was in working order, and Alfred
Vail said to Baxter:
"William, go up to the house and ask father to come
down and see the telegraph machine work."
The boy ran eagerly, in his shop clothes and without
any coat, and Judge Vail followed him  back to the little
room, Mr. Vail wrote on a slip of paper, " A patient waiter is no loser.
He handed this to Alfred, saying:
If you can send that so that INSTRUMENT FOR SENDING TELEGRAMS.
Professor Morse can read it at the
other end of the wire, I shall be convinced."
Alfred clicked it off, and Morse read it at his end.
The old gentleman was overjoyed.
But there was a great deal of trouble after this in
getting the matter started.  It was thought necessary to
have the government build the first line, because business
men were slow to try new things in that day. The President, and other public men, showed much curiosity about
the new machine, but Congress was slow to give money
to construct a line.
i67he persuaded her to bring back Columbus. She sent the
great navigator a mule and some decent clothes.
But Columbus, when lie got back to court, still demanded such high rewards if he should succeed that he was
again allowed to depart.  He set out to offer his plan to
the King of France; but now his friends again interceded
with the queen, lamenting that Spain should lose his services.  The queen sent a messenger after him, who overtook him in a pass of the mountains and brought him
back, with the assurance that, at last, he would be sent
forth on his voyage.

6In I842 a bill was passed in the House of Representatives appropriating thirty thousand dollars to construct a
telegraph on Morse's plan from Washington to Baltimore.
It had yet to pass the Senate before it could become a law.
When the last hours of the session had arrived, a senator
told Morse that his bill could not be passed, there were so
many other bills to be voted on before it.  Morse went to
his hotel, and found that, after paying his bill and buying
his ticket to New York, he had thirty-seven cents left.
But the next morning, while he was eating his breakfast before leaving Washington, Miss Ellsworth, the daughter of the commissioner of patents, brought Morse word
that his bill had passed the night before. For her kindness the inventor promised her that she should send the
first message over a telegraph line.
Morse tried to lay his wires underground in pipes, but
it was found that naked wires laid in this way let the electricity escape into the ground.  What was to be done?
There were now but seven thousand dollars left of the
thirty thousand.  To change their plan would be to confess that those who were building the telegraph had made
a mistake, and this would make people more suspicious
than ever. The machine for digging the ditch in which the
wires were to be laid was run against a stone and broken
on purpose to make an excuse for changing the plan.
A year had been wasted, when it was decided to put
the wires on poles.  At last, in I844, the wires were
strung, and Miss Ellsworth sent the first message, which
was, "What hath God wrought!"  The first news thatwent over the wire was that James K. Polk had been
nominated for President.
But at first people would not believe that messages had
come over the wire. They waited for the mails to bring
the same news before they could believe it. One man asked
how large a bundle could be sent over the wires.  A joking
fellow hung a pair of dirty boots on the wire, and gave it
out that they had got muddy from traveling so fast. A
woman who saw a telegraph pole planted in front of her
door said she supposed she could not punish her children
any more without everybody knowing it. She thought the
wire would carry news of its own accord.  At first few
messages were sent.  The operators worked for nothing,
and slept under their tables. But after a while people began to use the wires, which were gradually extended over
the country.  Another kind of electric telegraph had been
tried in England, but Morse's plan was found the best.
Before Morse put up his first line he had tried a telegraph through the water.  To keep the electricity from
escaping, he wound the wire with thread soaked in pitch
and surrounded it with rubber.  He laid this wire from
Castle Garden, at the lower end of New York city, across
to Governor's Island, in the harbor. He was able to telegraph through it, but before he could exhibit it the anchor
of a vessel drew up the wire, and the sailors carried off
part of it.
About I85o, Cyrus W. Field, of New York, got the
notion that a telegraph could be laid across the Atlantic
Ocean.  After much trouble to raise the money needed,
I69and two attempts to lay a telegraph cable across the
ocean, the first cable was laid successfully in I858. The
Queen of England sent a message to the President of
the United States, and President Buchanan sent a reply.
Many great meetings were held to rejoice over this union
of the Old World with the New.  But the first Atlantic
telegraph cable worked feebly for three weeks, and then
ceased to work altogether.
Mr. Field now found it hard work to get people to
put money inito a new cable.  Seven years after the first
one was laid, the Great Eastern,
the largest ship afloat, laid
broke. The next year,
in i866, the end of this caTHE GREAT EASTERN.
ble was found and brought
up from  thie bottom  of the sea.  It was spliced to a new
one, which was laid successfully.
Morse lived to old age, no longer pinched for money,
and honored in Europe and America for his great invention. He died in 1872, when nearly eighty-one years old.
The latest wonder in telegraphing is the telephone,
which is a machine by which the actual words spoken are
carried upon a wire and heard at the other end of the
line.  The invention was made about the same time  in
somewlat different forms, by several different men.I7I

Early Life of Abraham  Lincoln.  
FIVE years after Daniel Boone                       _
took his family to Kentucky ~ -
there came over the mountains
a man named Abraham Lincoln,
bringing his wife and children.               *
The Lincolns and Boones were
friends.  They were mnuch the
same kind  of people, hunters           A SCHOOLHOUSE IN THE BACKWOODS.
and pioneers, always seeking a new  and  wild country to
live in.  This Abraham  Lincoln, the friend of Boone, was
grandfather of President Abraham Lincoln, who was born
in a log cabin in Kentucky in I809.When little Abe Lincoln was seven years old, his father
moved from Kentucky to southwestern Indiana, which was
then a wild country.  Here he lived in a house of the
roughest and poorest sort known to backwoods people.  It
had three sides closed with logs.  The other side was left
entirely open to the weather. There was no chimney, but
the fire was built out of doors in front of the open side.
There was no floor. Such a wretched shelter is called a
"half-faced camp."  It is not so good as some Indian wigwarns. Of course, the food and clothes and beds of a
family living in this way were miserable.
Poor little Abe Lincoln sometimes attended backwoods
schools.  The log schoolhouses in Indiana at that time
YCUNG LINCOLN WRITING LETTERS FOR THE NEIGHBORS.
had large open fireplaces, in which there was a great
blazing  fire  in  the winter.   The boys of the  school had  to
I72chop and bring in the wood for this fire.  The floor of
suchl a schoolhouse was of rough boards hewn out with
axes. The schoolmasters were generally harsh men, who
persuaded their pupils to study by means of long beech
switches, such as they were accustomed to use in driving
oxen. These schoolmasters did not know much themselves,
but bright little Abe  
Lincolnsoonlearned
to write. This was
very handy for his
father and othermen
in the neighborhood
who could not write
and who got Abraham to write their
letters for them.
Lincolncouldnot &amp;
get many books to
read in a community so
destitute and illiterate.
He could not have wasted
his time and weakened his
mind, as so many boys and
girls do now, by reading exciting
stories, for he did not have them. He read carefully the
books that he had. The Bible, AS;sop's Fables, Pilgrim's
Progress, a life of Washington, and a life of Henry Clay
he read over and over again, for he could get no other
books.   Whenever he heard any subject talked about
173that he did not understand, he would go off alone and
think it out, and try to put it into clear words.  This
habit of close and careful thinking, and this practice in
clothing his thoughts in words that exactly fitted them,
was the best education in the world. Many boys and girls
who have good schools and good books never learn to
think for themselves.
When one is poor, a little money means a great deal.
One day Abraham Lincoln, by this time eighteen years
old, rowed two men with their baggage from the shore
out to a steamboat in the Ohio River. For this the men
dropped two silver half-dollars into the boat.  Abraham
was overjoyed.  To think that a poor boy could earn so
much money in so short a timrne made the whole world
seem wider and fairer before him, he said.
The people of southern Indiana in that day used to
send what they raised on their farms to New Orleans.

and potatoes on large' ~...... _..... _flatboats, sometimes a hundred

Ohio River to where that
river empties into the Mississippi, and then down the Mississippi. It was a long voyage, and the boatmen had to live
on their boats for many weeks. They rowed the boats with
long sweeps, or oars, which required two and sometimes
I74four men to move each one of them. Lincoln was much
trusted, and when he was nineteen years old he was sent
down the river in charge of one of these boats.  This gave
him his first knlowledge of the world.  
By the time he was twenty-one he    ~
had attained the height of six feet       &gt;
four inches.   His  father, who was  
always poor, once more sought a
newer country by removing to Illinois.  Here  Abraham  helped  to
build a log cabin, and then he split
the rails to make a fence around
the new cornfield.  In order to get
clothes, he went out to work as a hired.

spun brown jeans that went to make
his trousers.  Perhaps he was sorry to be so tall and to
need so much cloth for a pair of trousers.
Lincoln went a second timne on a flatboat to New Orleans. The boat was loaded with live hogs, and it is said
that Lincoln, finding that the hogs could not be driven,
carried them otl board the boat in his long arms. After
he came back he became a clerk in a country store, where
he employed his spare time in reading.  Like Franklin, he
I75got his education by the right use of his leisure time. In
this store he showed that careful honesty for which he
was always remarkable.  Once, when by mistake he had
taken a "fip "-that is, six and a quarter cents-more
than was due from a customer, he walked several miles
the same nighlt to return  the money.   When  he found
that, by using the wrong weight, he had given a woman
two ounces of tea less than she ought to have had, he
again walked a long distance in order to make the matter
right.
One of the things he wanted to learn was English
grammar, in order to speak more correctly; but grammars were hard to find at that time.  He heard of a man
eight miles away who had a grammar, so he wvalked the
eight miles and borrowed it. Lincoln got a lawyer who
sometimes visited the store to explain what he could not
understand in his grammar.
Home'-spun, cloth made at home. Jeans [jeens], a strong homemade woolen cloth, often called "Kentucky jeans." It was the cloth most
used for men's garments while the country west of the Alleghanies was
new. (The word jean originally meant a stout cotton cloth, and is so used
in Europe.) Fip, a coin no longer used. It was worth six and a quarter
cents, and had been called "fivepenny bit," from which " fip'ny bit," and
then " fip." The same coin was called a "sixpence" in New York, and
by other names elsewhere.

Lincoln in Public Life.
IN I832, when there was an Indian war in Illinois,
known as the Blackhawk War, Lincoln volunteered to
fight against the chief Blackhawk and his Indians.  Lincoln was chosen captain of the company. But he did not
happen to be in any battle during the war.  He used to
say, jokingly, that he" fought, bled, and came away.
When "Captain" Lincoln got home from the Blackhawk War, he bought out a country store in New Salem,
where he lived.  He had a worthless young man for a
partner, and Lincoln himself was a better student than
merchant. Many bad debts were made, and, after a while,
as Lincoln expressed it, the store " winked out."  This
failure left him in debt. For six years afterwards he lived
very savingly, until he had paid every cent of his debts.
After he ceased to keep store he was postmaster. In a
country post office he could borrow and read his neighbors' papers before they were called for.  He used to
carry letters about in the crown of his hat, and distribute
the mail in that way.
Next he became a surveyor.  He studied surveying
alone, as he did other things. His strict honesty and his
charming good-nature, as well as his bright speeches,
amusing stories, and witty sayings, made him a favorite
among the people.  In I834 he was elected to the Illinois Legislature. In a suit of homespun he walked a hundred miles to attend the Legislature.  When the session

How Columbus discovered America.
ABOUT two hundred years before
i!~&amp;,k     Columbus sailed, there arrived in the
city of Venice [ven'-is] one day three
travelers, coarsely dressed in Chinese fashion. They said that they
were three gentlemen named Polo,
who had left Venice many years be-!'j~  fore.  They had almost forgotten
how to speak Italian, and at first
their own relatives thought them foreigners and impostors. But they gave a magnificent banquet at which they all appeared
in rich robes. They changed their garments again and again as the feast went on. Every robe
taken off was cut up and given to the servants. At last
they took their old garments and ripped them open, and
poured out before the guests a collection
of precious stones of untold value.
One of these gentlemen, Marco Polo,
whose  portrait you see here, wrote a book
of hiis travels, describing the vast riches of
Eastern countries, before unknown to people in Europe.  Columbus had read this
book, and it was to find a new way to
reach the rich countries seen by Polo that he was now
resolved to sail partly round the globe.
7was over he came home and went to surveying again.
Whenever he had a little money he applied himself to
studying law.  When his money gave out he took up his
compass and
went back to
surveying.
In  1837
he went to
Springfield,
and   began
life  as   a
lawyer. The

was  called,
with the others, and he
was soon a successful lawyer.
He would not take a case which would put him on the
unjust side of a quarrel.  Nor would he take pay from
people whom he knew. to be poor, so he did not become
-a rich man.
Lincoln  was always remarkable for his kindness of
i78heart.  While riding along the road one day he saw a
pig fast in a mudhole.  As he had on a new suit of
clothes he did not like to touch the muddy pig, and so
he rode on, leaving piggy to get out if he could.  But
he could not get the pig out of his thoughts, so, when
he had gone two miles, he turned his horse back and
helped the floundering pig out of his distress.  He said
he did this to "take a pain out of his own mind."
Once a poor widow, who had been kind to him many
years before, asked him to defend her son, who was on
trial for murder.  It was proved in court by a witness
that in a drunken row this widow's son had struck the
blow that killed the man.  Everybody thought the young
man would be hanged. When questioned by Lincoln, the
witness said that he had seen the murder by moonlight.
Then Lincoln took a little almanac out of his pocket, and
showed the court that at the time the man was killed the
moon had not risen. The young man was declared "not
guilty;" but Lincoln would not take any pay from the
mother.
In I846 Abraham  Lincoln was elected a member of
Congress.  This was during the war with Mexico.  In
that day the Southern States allowed negroes to be held
as slaves.  The Northern States had abolished slavery, so
that part of the States were called free States and part
slave States.  There came up, about this time, a great
debate as to whether slavery should be allowed in the
new  Territories.  Lincoln strongly opposed the holding
of slaves in the Territories, and he soon became known
I79as a speaker on that side of the question.  His fame
reached to the East, and Abraham Lincoln, who had come
up from the poverty of a half-faced camp, was invited to
address a large meeting in the great hall of Cooper Institute, in New York.  You see, the boy who had tried to
think everything out clearly, and to put every subject into
just the right words, had got such a knack of saying
things well, that multitudes of educated people were delighted to listen to his clear and witty speeches.
When, in I86o, the antislavery men came to nominate
a President, many of the Western people wanted Lincoln,
whom they had come to call "Old Abe," and " Honest
Old Abe:"  When the convention that was to nominate
a President met, the friends of Lincoln carried in two of
the fence rails he had split when he was a young man,
and thousands of people cheered them.  Lincoln was
nominated, and, as the other party split into two parts, he
was elected.
This election was followed by the great civil war.
The war made President Lincoln's place a very trying
one, for people blamed him for all defeats and failures.
But during all the four years of war he was patient and
kindly, and by his honesty and wisdom he won the affections of the people and the soldiers.  People thought of
him at first as only a man who had happened to get
elected President. But during these long years he showed
himself a great man, and when the war was ended he was
respected over all the world.
When the terrible war was over and the soldiers were
I 8ccoming home, Lincoln was shot by an assassin as he sat
in the theater, on the I4th of April, i865.  His death was
lamented not only over all this country, but throughout
Europe, for his goodness of heart made him as much
loved as his greatness of mind made him admired.

Something about the Great Civil War.
SOON after Abraham  Lincoln  became  President there
broke out the civil war, which caused the death of many
hundreds of thousands of brave men, and brought sorrow
to nearly every home in the United States. Perhaps none
of those who study this book will ever see so sad a time.
But it was also a brave time, when men gave their lives for
the cause they believed to be right. Women, in those days,
suffered in patience the loss of their husbands and sons, and
I3
isivery many of them went to nurse the wounded, or toiled
at home to gather supplies of nourishing food for sick
soldiers in hospitals.
The war came about in this way: There had been
almost from the foundation of the Government a rivalry
between the Northern and Southern States.  Long and
angry debates took place about slavery, about the rights of
the States and the government of the Territories. These
had produced much bitter feeling. When a President opposed to slavery was elected, some of the Southern States
asserted that they had a right to withdraw from the Union.
This the Northern States denied, declaring that the Union
could not be divided; but before Lincoln was inaugurated,
seven States had declared themselves out of the Union.
They formed a new  government, which they
called " the Confederate States of America,"
and elected Jefferson Davis President.
President Lincoln refused to acknowledge
~~   [ ~that the Confederate States were a government. He refused to allow the United States
fort in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina, to be surrendered to the Confederates,
and he sent ships with provisions for the
v E Z &amp;small garrison of this fort. The Southern
troops about Charleston refused to let
X    X/// )\-  these provisions be landed, and at length
~   opened fire on the fort. This began the
war. Four other States now joined the
ULYSSES S. GRANT.   Confederacy, making eleven in all.I83
It was a time of awful excitement in every part of the
country.  All winter long angry passions had been rising
both in the North and in the South. When the first gun
was fired at Sumter, in April, I86I, there was such a storm
of fierce excitement as may never be seen again in America. In the North, a hundred thousand men
were enlisted in three days. The excitement in  
the South was just as great, and a large portion of the Southern people rushed to arms.
In those stormy times the drums were beat-           -  
ing all day long in the streets; flags waved
in every direction, and trains were thronged
with armed men bidding farewell to friends       
and hastening forward to battle and death.
Men and women wept in the streets as they
cheered" the boys" who were hurrying away  
to the war.  For a while people hardly.            [

histories.  The armies on both sides became very large,
and during the war there were some of the greatest conflicts ever seen in the world.  The first great battle was
fought at Shiloh, in Tennessee. Others tobk place at Murfreesboro [mur'-freze-bur'-ro], Chickamauga [chick-a-maw'gah], and Nashville, in Tennessee; at Antietam [an-tee'tam], in Maryland; and at Gettysburg, in Pennsylvania.
Very many battles, great and small, were fought in Virginia,
between Washington and Richmond.On the side of the Union the three most famous generals
were U. S. Grant, W. T. Sherman, and Philip H. Sheridan. The three greatest generals on the Confederate side
were Robert E. Lee, Joseph E. Johnston, and
Thomas J. Jackson, commonly called " Stonewall Jackson."
Both sides showed the greatest courage.,!'   g The generals on both sides were very skill-..'. 2'  ful. Victory was now with one party and; X.g  ~now with the other; but, as the years passed

General Grant.                             UNION SOLDIER.
During the time of this siege General Sherman marched
directly into the heart of the Confederacy, where he was
for weeks without any communication with the North. Hemarched across the great and fertile State of Georgia, from
Atlanta to Savannah, on the seacoast, and then from Savannah  northward  toward  Richmond.   By destroying the
railroads and the food by which General Lee's army in
Richmond was supplied, this march of Sherman's made it
impossible for the Confederates to continue the war.
Lee was forced to retreat from Richmond, and he surrendered his army on the 9th of April, I865.  All the other
Confederate forces soon after laid down their arms. The
war had lasted four years. As a result of the long struggle, slavery was abolished in all the territory of the United
States.

Something about the Spanish War.
THE war with Spain took place in I898. It was caused
by two things. For many years there had been a rebellion
against Spain in Cuba. Our people were very sorry for the
Cuban people, who were treated cruelly. This made the
Spaniards angry at the United States. One of our war ships,
the Maine, was sent to the harbor of Havana [ha-van'a], to
protect Americans there. It was blown up in the night and
two hundred and sixty-six men on board were killed. An
examination showed that it was blown up by something
placed against the outside of the ship. This aroused the
American people.  Congress demanded that Spain should
take her armies away from Cuba. This she refused to do,
and war was declared.
When war was declared, there was an American fleet in
Chinese waters. There was a Spanish fleet at Manila [manil'a] in the Philippine [fil'ip-in] Islands, which belonged to
Spain. Commodore Dewey, who commanded the American
fleet, sailed to Manila as soon as he heard of the beginning
of the war.
Not finding the Spanish fleet outside of the harbor, he
sailed into the great Bay of Manila very silently. This was
about midnight before the morning of the first day of May.
All the lights on the ships that could have been seen from
the shore were put out, so that the last ship was passing the
batteries at the entrance to the bay before the alarm was
given. At daylight the ships gave battle to the Spanish
I86fleet, which was protected by shore batteries. It seemed
certain that somne, if not all, of the American ships would be
sunk by the heavy guns on shore, but the Spanish gunners
were not equal to those of the American ships, who had
given much attention to target practice.  The Spaniards
BATTLE OF MANILA BAY,
fought bravely, but their shore batteries were silenced and
their fleet destroyed by the American fire. The American
fleet did not lose a single man in the fight.
A Spanish fleet sent from Spain to attack the American
coast towns took refuge in the harbor of Santiago [sahn-teah'go] in Cuba. The harbor was so well protected that the
187In spite of the power which the King of Spain gave
him to force ships and seamen to go with him, Columbus
found the greatest trouble in fitting out his expedition, so
much were the sailors afraid of the ocean. But at last all
was ready.  Those who were to sail into " The Sea of
Darkness" with Columbus received the sacraments and bade
a solemn farewell to their friends, feeling much like men
condemned to death. They embarked in three little vessels, only one of which had a deck over it.
Columbus went to the Canary Islands first.  Then with
bitter lamentations the men took leave of the last known
land, and sailed into seas in which no ship had ever been.
Columbus tried to cheer them  with the stories he had
read in Marco Polo's book, of the riches of the
great country of China. But he also de-?  D ceived them  by keeping two separate
accounts of his sailing.  In the one
which he showed to his companions
he made the distance from Spain much
less than it really was.
But they were greatly alarmed to
VPOLO'S  find that, as they went west, the needle
COLUMBUS READING POLO'S BOOK.  of the compass did not point directly to
the north star.  This change, though well known now,
was probably as surprising to Columbus as to his men,
but he did his best to keep up their courage.
The weather was fine, and the winds blew always from
the east. This alarmed the sailors more than ever, for they
were sure they would get no wind to come back with.American fleet could not enter it. An army was landed to
the east of the city of Santiago to take it by land. One
portion of this army was sent to take the little village of El
Caney [ca-nay'] at the north, and another was sent to wait in
front of the hill of San Juan [hoo-ahn'] and capture that
after E1 Caney was taken. But the men in front of the batteries of San Juan found themselves under fire. Many of
them were killed. They could not retreat, for the narrow
road behind them was crowded. They were not willing to
stay where they were and be slaughtered. So they resolved
about noon to attack the Spaniards in the batteries ahead of
them.  "If you don't wish to go along," said the colonel of
the regiment known as the Rough Riders, "let my men
pass, please." But the men to whom he spoke did wish to
go along. They fell into line and followed Roosevelt [rose'velt], who led a desperate charge on horseback. In another
part of the line a veteran general, Hawkins, rode at the head
of his men, waving his hat. Slowly up the hill marched the
Americans under a deadly fire, until at last they carried the
trenches and blockhouse at the summit with a rush.
Three miles away, at El Caney, a yet more stubborn
fight was raging. The Americans in the thick of it were
commanded by General Chaffee, who made his men lie down,
but who stood erect himself. A button was shot off his coat,
and one of his shoulder straps was torn by bullets. At last
the works at E1 Caney were carried. These battles took
place on the Ist of July.
Two days after the battles by which the Americans carried
the Spanish trenches, the American ships were watching the
i88mouth of the harbor as usual. To their surprise the Spanish
fleet was seen coming out from Santiago. The Spanish ships
tried to escape by running to the westward. But the American ships pursued and fought them until one after another
of the Spanish vessels was sunk or set on fire. The American sailors rescued as many as possible of the drowning
Spaniards, and treated them kindly. The city of Santiago
was soon after surrendered. After these successes of the
Americans it was impossible for Spain to continue her resistance long. Peace was made at last. As a result of the
war Spain gave up her authority over Cuba, Porto Rico

I95size of the country was more than doubled when Louisiana was added to it.
The province of Louisiana did not reach to the westward of the Rocky Mountains.  But in 179I, before Louisiana was bought, Robert Gray, the first sea captain that
ever carried the American flag around the world, discovered the river Oregon, which he called the Columbia, after
the name of his ship.  After Jefferson had bought Louisiana for the United States, he sent the explorers Lewis and
Clark with a party to examine the western part of the
new territory, and to push on to the Pacific. These men
were two years and four months making the trip from
St. Louis to the Pacific Ocean

and back.  They reached the
ocean in I805, and spent the winter at the mouth of the Columbia
River.   The  "Oregon
country," as it was called,
was then an unclaimed
wilderness, and the discovery of the riv-.
er  by  Captain
Gray, with the exploration of the
country by Lewis
and Clark, gave            Cut out this part within the dotted lii

I97One day the wind came around to the southwest, which
was a great encouragement.
But presently the ships struck great masses of seaweed,
and all was grumbling and lamentation again.  The frightened sailors remembered old stories of a frozen ocean, and
imagined that this must be the very place. When the wind
fell to a calm, they thought the ships might lie there and
rot for want of wind to fill the sails.
They were getting farther and farther away from Europe.
Where would they find food and water to last them till
they got home? They thought their commander a crackbrained fool, who would go on to their destruction. They
planned, therefore, to throw him into the
sea, and go back. They could say that,
while he was gazing at the stars, after
his fashion, he had tumbled over.
But the worst disappointments were
to come.  One day the glad cry of
" Land!" was raised. Columbus fell on
his knees to return thanks, while the
men scrambled up into the rigging.
But it proved to be only a cloud. On
the 7th of October another false alarm disheartened the
sailors more than ever.
From the first Columbus had pointed to seaweed, and
other supposed signs of land, until the men would no longer
listen to his hopeful words.  Now the appearance of some
song birds, a heron, and a duck, could not comfort them.
The great enterprise was about to end in failure, after all,
9was added to the United States by these explorations is
shown on page I95. By cutting off the white part of
page I93 and laying it down upon I95, you will see how
the "Oregon country" extended the United States to
the Pacific Ocean.
On this same page I95 you will also find a map of
Florida. The peninsula of Florida was occupied by the
Spaniards more than forty years before the first colony of
English people landed at Jamestown. From  the time the
colonies were settled, there were many quarrels between
the people of this country and the Spanish inhabitants
of Florida. But in I821 Florida was bought from Spain,
and became a part of the United States.
Mexico, which was at first a Spanish colony, rebelled
against Spain, and secured its independence. One of the
States of the Mexican Republic was Texas. Americans
who had settled in Texas got into a dispute with the
government of Mexico. This took the form of a revolution, and  Texas became an  independent republic, under
a president of its own. In I845 this republic of Texas
was annexed to
the United States
by its own consent,  and  has
been from that
time the largest
State  in  the
Union. By  removing the blank
i98part of page I95 you wvill connect tile map of Texas, on
page I97, with the rest, and this will show what our country was in 1845.
The Mexicans, though driven out of Texas, were quite
unwilling to lose so large a territory. The annexation of
Texas to the United States led to a war with Mexico, which
lasted two years. During this war the United States troops
took from Mexico California, on the Pacific coast, and a
large region known as New Miexico, in the interior.  At
the close of the war, in 1847, this territory was retainled by
the United States, which paid to Mexico fifteen million
dollars for it. Another small tract was bought from Mexico in I85I, which we may account part of the addition
from  Mexico in consequence of the war, and consider the
two together.  You will see, on this page, how large a region was added to the country by these annexations from
Mexico.  Cut out the blank space from  page I97, and
you will see how the country has been built up by additions of territory
to its present: size.  FIFTH AND SIXTH ADDITIONS,

the country by looking at the map on page IgO, in its relao
tion to the sections on pages I9I, I93, I95, I97, and I99.
Our country also owns some outlying islands: the Hawaiian
Islands, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, which were
annexed in I898; and the islands taken from Spain at the
close of the Spanish War. The territory of the United
States is thus made up of ten parts. There is, first, the
country as it was at the close of the Revolutionary War,
and then nine additions made at different times.

THE END.
207when, on the iith of October, the sailors found a branch
of a thorn-tree with berries on it.  At length a carved
stick was found, and the men began to believe that they
were really near to some inhabited land.
During the night wlhich followed this discovery no one
on the ships slept. About ten o'clock Columbus saw  a
glimmering light appearing and disappearing, as though some one on shore were
carrying a torch. At two o'clock a
sailor sighted land.
Tile morning light of Friday, October I2, I492, showed the Spaniards
a beautiful little island.  Columbus
dressed himself in scarlet, and planted
the Spanish standard on the shore,
throwing- himself on the earth and
kissing it, while the naked Indians
wondered whether these men in bright
armor had flown from the skies in their winged boats or
had sailed down upon the clouds.  The sailors, lately so
ready to cast Columbus into the sea, now crowded about
him, embracing him and kissing his hands.
When the Indians had recovered from their first surprise, they visited the ships, some of them in canoes, and
others by swimming.  They brought with them  a ball of
cotton yarn, bread made from roots, and some tame parrots, which, with a few golden ornaments, they exchanged
for caps, glass beads, tiny bells, and other trifles, with
which they could adorn themselves.SUPPLEMENTARY READING

B3 FRANCIS H. WHITE, A.M., Professor of History
aild Political Science, Kansas State Agricultural College
A BLANK book, which is intended for the pupil's use in
connection with any good history of the United States.
It presents an original combination of devices conveniently arranged, and affords an unusually clear idea of our
country's history in which the chief events are deeply impressed
on the learner's mind. The entire development of the United
States has been taken up in the most logical manner, and facts
of a similar nature have been grouped naturally together.
~ This material is in the form of outline maps, charts, tables,
outlines for essays, book references, etc., with full directions
for the pupil, and suggestions to the teacher.  Students are
required to locate places, trace routes, follow lines of development, make pictures of objects illustrating civilization, write
compositions, etc.
~ The use of this book has demonstrated that the teaching of
history need no longer present any difficulties to the teacher.
Mere memorizing is discouraged, and the pupil is compelled
to observe closely, to select essential facts, to classify his
knowledge, to form opinions for himself, and to consult the
leading authorities. The interest thus instilled will invariably
lead to a sufficient grasp of the subject.
~T The body of the book is divided into the following general
headings: The Indians; Discovery and Exploration; Colonization; The Development of Nationality; Military History;
The Progress of Civilization; Political History; and Our
Flag and Its Defenders.  While none of these periods is
treated exhaustively, each is taken up so comprehensively and
suggestively that further work can be made easily possible
where more time is available.

adapted for general use, rather than for a particular use
in a highly specialized and organized ideal system.  While
not too technical and scientific, it includes sufficient physiographic information for the needs of most teachers.
~  An adequate amount of material is included in each book
to meet the requirements of those grades for which it is designed.
This matter is presented so simply that the pupil can readily
understand it, and so logically that it can easily be taught by
the average teacher.
~ The simplicity of the older methods of teaching this subject
is combined with just so much of the modern scientific methods
of presentation as is thoroughly adapted to elemcntary grades.
Only enough physiography is included to develop the fundamental relations of geography, and to animate and freshen the
study, without overloading it in this direction.
The physical maps of the grand divisions are drawn to the
same scale, thus enabling the pupil to form correct concepts
of the relative size of countries.  The political and more detailed maps are not mere skeletons, giving only the names
which are required by the text, but are full enough to serve
all ordinary purposes for reference.  In addition, they show
the principal railroads and canals, the head of navigation on
all important rivers, and the standard divisions of time.

(57)The island which Columbus first discovered was a small
one, which he called San Salvador, but we do not now know
which of the West India Islands it was.  He thought that
he was on the coast of Asia.  But where were the rich
islands and great cities and houses roofed with gold, of
which Marco Polo had written two hundred years before?
From island to island Columbus sailed, looking for these
things, not knowing that they were thousands of miles
away.   Finding the island of Cuba very large, he concluded that it was a part of the mainland of Asia.

III.
Columbus after the Discovery of America.
COLUMBUS was very kind to the natives. At one time
a poor savage was captured by the sailors and brought to
Columbus, who was standing on the high after-castle of the
ship.  The terrified Indian sought to gain his favor by
presenting the great man with a ball of cotton yarn.  Columbus refused the present, but he put upon the Indian's
head a pretty colored cap; he hung bells in his ears, and
tied strings of green beads about his arms.  Then he sent
the simple creature ashore, where his friends were afterward seen admiring his ornaments.
At another time the sailors picked
up an Indian who was crossing in an
open canoe a wide tract of water
from one island to another. This man had a piece of
cassava bread and a gourd of water for his sea stores.
He also had a bit of red paint with which to decoGOURD   rate his face before appearing among strangers, and
BOTTLE,a string of beads procured from the white men. He was
rowing to a neighboring island to carry the news of the
coming of the Spaniards. IHis canoe was taken on board,
he was fed with the best food of the ship, and put ashore
at his destination.
Having got one of his vessels ashore on the coast of
Haiti [ha'-tee], which he called Hispaniola [his-pan-ee-o'lali], Columbus built a fort of the timber from the wrecked
vessel and left here a little colony.
But now  he began  to  think of carrying home the
good news of his great discovery.  In January, I493, he
set sail for Spain.  On the I2th of January, when all
were looking forward to a joyful return, a terrific storm
threatened to wreck the ship and to bury in the ocean all
memory of the great discovery. Prayers were
said and vows were made, for the safety of
the ship.
To preserve the memory of his discovery/  
if all else should be lost, Columbus wrote
two accounts of it, which he inclosed in
cakes of wax and put into two barrels. X   lX  
One of these was thrown into the sea; the
other was set upon the stern of the vessel, m    m
that it might float off if the ship shliould go
down.  He hoped that one of these barrels
might drift to the coast of Europe and be found.
Columbus at length  reached  the islands called the
Azores.  Here, when the storm  had abated, some of his
men went aslhore to perform  their vows at a little chapel,and were made prisoners by the Portuguese governor.
Having got out of this difficulty, Columbus put to sea and
met another gale, which split his sails and threatened to
wreck the vessel.  He finally came to anchor in a Portuguese port, where he no doubt felt some exultation in showing what Portugal had lost by refusing his offers.
In April he reached Barcelona [bar-say-lo'-nah], a Spanish city, and made his entry in a triumphal procession.
At the lhead marched the Indians whom  he had brought
back with him.  These were
well smeared with paint and
}   decorated with the feathers of
tropical birds and with gold-!r~~~ ~en ornaments.  Then
parrots and stuffed
birds were borne in the procession with articles of gold. Columbus followed, escorted by Spanish knights proud to do him
honor, Ferdinand and Isabella received him under a canopy of gold brocade.  As a mark of special honor, they
caused hiim to sit down while he related his discoveries.
This was the happiest moment in the troubled life of
Columbus.  He who had been thought insane was now the
most honored man in Spain.
The rest of his story is mostly a story of misfortunes.
The people in his first colonly on the island of Hispaniola
quarreled among themselves and maltreated the Indians,
until thle latter fell on them  and killed them  all.  The
second colony was also unfortunate. Columbus was not a
wise governor, and he had many troubles in trying to settle
a new country with   
unruly and avaricious people.
An officer sent out to inquire into the disorders in the
colony sent Columbus home in chains.  The people were
shocked at this treatment of the great navigator, and so
were the kin, and queen, who ordered the chains removed.
When Columbus appeared before Isabella and saw tears in
her eyes, he threw himself on his knees, while his utterance was choked by his sobs.After this he was not permitted to return to his colony;
but in I502 he made his fourth voyage to America, trying
to find a way to get through the mainland
of South America in order to reach India,
which he thought must lie just beyond.
He was at length forced to run his
worm-eaten vessel aground near the
shore of the island of Jamaica [jamay'-cah]. Thatched cabins were
built on the deck of the stranded

One faithful follower, named Diaz [dee'-ath], traded a
brass basin, a coat, and his two shirts, to an Indian chief
for a canoe, in which after horrible suffering Diaz reached
Hispaniola.  Meantime the men on the wrecked ship got
provisions from the Indians in exchange for trinkets. Some
of the men ran away from Columbus and lived with the
savages.
The Indians now got tired of providing food in exchange for toys, and Columbus and his men were at the
point of starvation.  Knowing that an eclipse of the
moon was about to take place, he told the Indians that
a certain god would punish them  if they did not provide for him, and, as a sign, he said the moon would lose
its light and change color that very night.  No sooner
did the eclipse appear, than the Indians brought him all
the provisions at hand, and the Spaniards did not lack
after that.Help at length reached Columbus, and he returned  to  
Spain  broken  in health  and.

had been his best friend, died
soon after his returin.  Columbus died on the 2oth of

John Cabot and his Son Sebastian.
THE food eaten four or five hundred years ago was
mostly coarse and unwholesome.  The people were therefore very fond of all sorts of spices which they mixed with
almost everything they ate.  These spices were brought
from Asia by caravans. It was chiefly to get to the land of
spices by sea that Prince Henry the Navigator tried to
send ships around the southern point of Africa. Columbus
had also' tried to reach the " Spice Islands" of Asia in his
voyage to the west.
Now another Italian was to try it. This man was John
Cabot [cab'-ot]. Like Columbus, he was probably born in
or near the city of Genoa; like Columbus, he thought much
about geography as it was then understood; and, like Columbus, he was a great traveler. He moved to Venice and
then to Bristol in England.
The Italian merchants traveled farther than any others
in that day. One of Cabot's long trading journeys had
carried him into Arabia as far as the city
of Mecca [mekl-kah].
Here he saw the caravans that brought their loads of costly spices on the
backs of camels from the countries of the East.  Now
the people of Europe in Cabot's time, having very few
printed books, knew almost nothing about these far-away
Eastern countries."Where do these spices come from?" Cabot asked of
the men belonging to the caravan.
They answered that they brought them from a country
far to the east of Mecca, where they bought spices of other
caravans which brought them  from a land yet farther to
the east. From this Cabot reasoned as Columbus had done,
that, if he should sail to the west far enough, he would get
round the world to the land of spices. It would be something like going around a house to come in by the back
door.
While Cabot was living in England there came great news
out of Spain. One Christopher Columbus, it was said, had
discovered the coasts of India by sailing to the westward,
for Columbus thought the land he had found a part of India.
When this was told in England, people thought it " a thing
more divine than human to sail by the west into the east."
And when Cabot heard the story, there arose in his heart, as
he said, "a great flame of desire to do some notable thing."
While Columbus had waited in discouragement for Ferdinand and Isabella to accept his project, he had sent his
brother Bartholomew Columbus to Henry the Seventh, then
King of England, to offer the plan to him. What answer the
king gave to Bartholomew is not known, for, before the
latter got back to Spain, Christopher Columbus had returned from his first voyage.
But now for this same King Henry of England Cabot
offered to make a voyage like that of Columbus. As the
Atlantic had already once been crossed, the king readily
agreed to allow Cabot to sail under his authority.
igIn May, I497, Cabot set sail from Bristol in a small
vessel with eighteen men, mostly Englishmen. Cabot sailed
much farther north than Columbus, and he appears to have
discovered first the island of Cape Breton, now part of the
Dominion of Canada.  He went ashore on the 24th of
June, and planted a large cross and the flag of England,
as well as the flag of St. Mark, the patron saint of Venice.
He also discovered the mainland of North America.  Cabot
was thus the first to see the American continent. Columbus
discovered the mainland of South America a year later.
Cabot did not see any Indians, but he brought back some
of their traps for catching wild animals.
He got back to England in August, having been gone
but three months.  He brought news that he had discovpanions hepered the  territory of the Empromi, bhperor of China.'~_             The king gave
him  a pension,
he dressed hims   iIh    self in silks, and

GreatAdmiral."
It is to be feared
CABOT AND HIS TWO COUNTS.   this sudden rise
in the world puffed him up a great deal. To one of his companions he promised an island, and another island he was
going to bestow on his barber! On the strength of these
promises, both of these men set themselves up for counts!That there were many fish on the new coast was a fact
which impressed the practical Bristol people, though Cabot
had no thought of engaging in fishery.  He imagined that
by sailing a little farther south than before he might come
to the large island that Marco Polo called Cipango, and
we now call Japan.  He did not know that the far-off
country he had seen was not half so far away as Japan.
Cabot believed that all the spices and precious stones in
the world came from Cipango.
King Henry the Seventh fitted out Cabot with another
and much larger expedition. This expedition went far to
the north along the coast of America, and then away to
the south as far as the shores of what is now the State
of North Carolina. Cabot found Indians dressed in skins,
and possessing no metal but a little copper. He found
no gold, and he brought back no spices. The island of
Cipango and the territories of the Emperor *of China he
looked for in vain, though he was sure that he had reached
the coast of Asia.
Cabot's crew brought back stories of seas so thick with
codfish that their vessels were made to move more slowly
by them. They even told of bears swimming out into the
sea and catching codfish in their claws. But.
the English people lost interest in voy-  
ages that brought neither gold nor
spices, and we do not know anything
more about John Cabot.

and sometimes by the King of England.  He promoted

in the sailing of a new expedition of discovery, and visited with a company of ladies and gentlemen the Searchthrift, a little vessel starting on a voyage of exploration to

Captain John Smith.
ON the estate of Lord Willoughby, in the
eastern part of England, there was a family of
poor tenants named Smith, who had a son born
in I579. They named him John. John Smith is
the most common of names, but this was the
-*-"/&lt;'    most uncommon of all the John Smiths.  He
was apprenticed to learn a trade, but he ran away from his
master and became, for a while, a servant to Lord Willoughby, who was going to Holland.
Like most runaway boys, he found the world a hard
place, and had to lead a very rough-and-tumble life.  He
enlisted as a soldier; he was shipwrecked; he was robbed
and reduced to beggary; and, if we may believe his own
story, he was once pitched into the sea by a company of
pilgrims, who thought that he had caused the storm, like
Jonah in the Bible. This must have happened not far from
shore, for he reached land without the aid of a whale,
and went into the war against the Turks. There he killed
23Smith was thrashing wheat
on, the Turk began to
thrash him. Smith grew
angry, and, leaving the
wheat, hit his master with
the flail, killing him on the
spot. Then he took a bag
of wheat for food, mounted his master's horse and
escaped to the wilderness,
and got out of Turkey.
When, at last, Captain
Smith got back to England
with his wonderful budget
of stories about narrow escapes and bloody fights, he
probably found it hard to
settle down to a peaceful life.
The Englisll people were just
three Turks in single combat,
and cut off their heads, but
Captain John Smith came near
losing his own head in the
fight with the last one.
The Turks captured Smith
afterwards and made him a
slave.  His Turkish master
was very cruel, and put an
iron collar on his neck. While

America, which was quite wild and almost wholly unexplored.  Nothing suited the wandering and daring Captain Smith better.  He joined the coin1     =...........  pany which set sail for America, in three
little ships, in I606. The largest of these
was called the Susan Constant.
I amn sorry to say the people sent out
in this first company were what we should
call nowadays a hard set.  They were

Spaniards grew rich from the gold and
silver in South America, and they expected to pick up
gold without trouble.
The colony was settled at a place called Jamestown.
Soon after the settlers landed the Indians attacked them
while they were unarmed, and the settlers might all have
been put to death with the bows and arrows and war clubs
of the savages, if the people on one of
the ships had not fired a cross-bar shot
-such as you see in the picture. This
cross-bar shot happened to cut down a
limb of a tree over the heads of the
Indians. When they heard the noise
of the cannon, like thunder, and saw
the tree tops come tumbling on their
heads, the savages thought it was time
to make good use of their heels.
25The people of that day did not know how to plant
colonies, and the lack of good food and shelter caused
the death of more than half of the James&lt; 1'f~   "'f  towin settlers.  The Indians who lived near

and so saved the lives of many of the people.
The English thought America was only a narrow strip
of land.  They were still looking for a way to India, as
Columbus had looked for one more than a hundred years
before. The King of England had told them to explore
any river coming from  the nortliwest.  Smith therefore
set out to sail up the little Chickahom'iny River to find
the Pacific Ocean, not knowing that this
ocean was nearly three thousand miles away
The daring captain left his two
men in charge of the boat while he
went on farther.  The Indians

As all the Indians had a great curiosity to see a white
man, Smith was marched from one Indian village to another; but he was treated with a great deal of respect.
Perhaps the Indians thought that men who sailed in big
canoes and discharged guns that blazed and smoked and
made a noise like thunder and knocked the trees down,
must have some mysterious power. But they also thought
that if they could persuade the white people to give them
some big guns they could easily conquer all the Indian
tribes with which they were at war.
The Indians surrounded Smith with curious charms by
way of finding out whether he was friendly to them or
not. They fed him very well; but Smith, who was as ignorant of Indians as they were of
white people, thought that they
were fattening him to eat him,
so he did not have much appetite.
Powhatan [pow-ha-tan'] was
the name of the great chief of
these Indians.  This chief set
Smith free.  He sent some men
along with him on his return to Jamestown to bring back
two cannons and a grindstone in exchange for the prisoner;
but the Indians found these things rather too heavy to carry,
and they were forced to return with nothing but trinkets,
27Captain Smith seems to have been the best man to
control the unruly settlers and manage the Indians. The
people in England who had sent out this colony thought
they could make the chief, Powhatan, friendly by sending him presents. They sent him a crown, a wash basin,
and a bedstead, also a red robe, and other things quite unnecessary to a wild Indian. But when Powhatan for the
first time in his life had a bedstead and a wash basin and
a red gown, he  thought himself so important that he
would not sell corn to the settlers, who were in danger
of starving.  Captain Smith, however, showed him  some
blue glass beads, pretending that he could not sell them
because they were made of some substance like the sky,
and were to be worn only by the greatest princes. Powhatan became half crazy to get these precious jewels, and
Smith bought a large boat-load of corn for a pound or two
of beads.

More about Captain John Smith.
THE two best things about Captain John Smith were,
that he was never idle and he never gave up. He
was a good man to have in a colony, for he was
always trying to find out something new
or  to  accomplish  some  great
~6:
thing.  He  had  not found  a
way to  China in the swamps  
on the Chickahominy River; he had only found a
mudhole,  and  got himself captured by the In-  
id
dians. But                          ~                q

kal'S        R I    E  he thought he might find the Pacific Ocean by
sailing  up the Chesapeake  [ches'-apeak]  Bay.  So  he  went twice
up this bay, exploring at last to
the very head of it. Of course,
he did not find a way into the
Pacific Ocean.  We know  well
enough nodwadays that China is
not anywhere in the neighborhood
of Baltipmore.  But Smith made a
good map of the great bay, and he
bought corn from the Indians, and so kept
the colony alive.  This was better than  finding a way
to China, if he had only known it.
In living in an open boat and sailing among Indians that
were very suspicious and unfriendly, Smith and his men
had to siffer many hardships. They were sometimes nearly
wrecked by storms, and once when their sail had been torn
to pieces they patched it with the shirts off their backs.
Their bread was spoiled by the splashing of the salt water,
and they suffered so much from thirst that at one time
they would have been willing to give a barrel of gold, if
they had only had it, for a drink of puddle water.  Sometimes, when sleeping on the ground, they got so cold that
they were forced to get up in the night and move their
fire, so that they could lie down on the warm earth where
the fire had been.
At one place the Indians shot arrows at them from the
trees. Then they tried to get the Englishmen to come on
30shore by dancing with baskets in their hands.  Captain
Smith says that he felt sure they had nothing in their
baskets but villainy.  So he had his men fire off their
guns.  The noise of the guns so'frightened the savages
that they all dropped to the ground and then fled into the
woods.  Smith and his men now ventured ashore and left
presents of beads, little bells, and looking-glasses in their
wigwams.  Pleased with these things, the Indians became
friendly and fell to trading.
Once, when many of Captain Smith's men were ill, the
Indians attacked  him.  Smith put his sick men  under
a tarpaulin, and mounted their hats on sticks among his
well men, so that
the boat appeared
to  have its full
force.    Having
procured  Indian
shields of wickerwork,   Captain
Smith put them

his boat, so as to

made friends with  the Indian tribes, and he came back to Jamestown with plenty
of corn and furs.
Powhatan, the greatest of the Indian chiefs, wanted to
get the arms of the white men.  Muskets, swords, and pis3j[tols were now and then stolen by the Indians, and Captain Smith tried to put a stop to this thievery. Two Indians who were brothers stole a pistol.  They were captured, and one of them was put into prison, while the other
was sent to get the pistol.  The one in the prison was
allowed a fire of charcoal, to keep him from freezing.
When his brother came back the prisoner was found
smothered  by  the  gas
from  the charcoal fire.
The other poor fellow was
heartbroken; but Captain
Smith succeeded in reviving the one that had been
smothered. From this the
Indians concluded that he
was not only a great brave,
but a great medicine man
as well, who could bring
dead people to life.
At another time  an
Indian stole a bag of
gunpowder, which was a
thing of wonder to the
savages.  He  also  stole  a
piece of armor at the same time. He
had seen white men dry their powder when wet by putting it into a piece of armor and holding it over the
fire. He tried to do the same thing; but the fire was
too hot for the powder, and the Indian was treated to
32a very great surprise.  This terrified the savages for a
time.
In I6o9 there were many newcomers, and Captain
Smith's enemies got control of the colony.  They sent
Smith home, and he never saw Virginia again.
Captain Smith afterwards sailed on a voyage to New
England in I614. While his men caught and salted fish to
pay for the expense of the voyage, Smith sailed in an open
boat along the New England coast. He traded with the
Indians, giving them beads and other trinkets for furs. He
also made the first good map of the coast. After he had
returned to England with furs, Hunt, who was captain of
his second ship, coaxed twenty-four Indians on board and
then sailed away with them to Spain.  Here he made sale
of his shipload of salted fish, and began to sell the poor
Indians for slaves.  Some good monks, finding out what he
was doing, stopped him and took the Indians into their convent to make Christians of them. One of these Indians,
named Squanto [squon'-to], afterwards found his way to
England, and from there was taken back to America.
Captain Smith tried very hard to persuade English people to plant a colony in New England. He finally set out
with only sixteen men to begin a settlement there. He had
made friends with the New England Indians, and he was
sure that with a few men he could still succeed in planting
a colony.  But he had very bad luck.  He first lost the
masts of his vessels in a storm.  He returned to England
again and set sail in a smaller ship.  He was then chased
by a pirate vessel.  Smith found, on hailing this ship, that
33some of the men on board had been soldiers under him in
the Turkish wars. They proposed to him to be their captain, but he did not want to command such rogues.
Smith's little vessel had no sooner got away from these
villains, than he was chased by a French ship. He had to
threaten to blow up his ship to get his men to fight.  He
escaped again, but the next time he was met by a fleet of
French privateers. They made Smith come aboard one of
their vessels to show his papers. After they had got him
out of his ship they held him prisoner and took possession of
his cargo. They afterwards agreed to let him have his vessel
again, as he was still determined to sail to New England;
but his men wanted to turn back; so, while Smith was on
the French ship, his own men ran away with his vessel and
got back to England.  Thus his plan for a colony failed.
Smith spent his summer in the French fleet.  When the
French privateers were fighting with an English vessel they
made Smith a prisoner in the cabin; but when they fought
with Spanish ships they would put Smith at the guns and
make him fight with thom.  Smith reached England at last,.
and had the satisfaction of having some of his runaway sailors put into prison.  He never tried to plant another colony, though he was very much pleased with the success of
the Plymouth colony which settled in New England a few
years later than this.  This brave, roving, fighting, boasting captain'died in I631, when he was fifty-two years old.

The Story of Pocahontas.
WHILE Captain John Smith was a prisoner among the'
Indians of Powhatan's tribe, he made the acquaintance of
that chief's daughter, Pocahontas [po-ka-hon'-tas], a little
girl of ten or twelve years of age, with whom he was very
much pleased.  Years afterwards, he said that Powhatan
had at one time determined to put him to death; but when
Captain Smith's head was laid upon some stones, and
Indians stood ready to beat out his brains, Pocahontas laid
her head on his, so that they could not kill Captain Smith
without striking her; seeing which, Powhatan let him live.
Captain Smith said nothing about this occurrence in the
first accounts of his captivity, and many people think that
it never happened.
But it is certain that, whether Pocahontas saved his
life at this time or not, he was much attached to her, and
she became very fond of going to Jamestown, where she
35played with the boys in the street.  When the settlers
were in danger of starving, she brought them food. When
za messenger was sent
from Jamestown to
carry an important
message to Captain
Smith, then in Powhatan's country, she
hid the man, and got
him through in spite
of Powhatan's desire
to kill him. When
the Indians intended to kill Captain
Smith, she went to
his tent at night and
gave him  warning.
Captain  Smith  offered her trinkets as
a reward, but she
refused them, with
tears in her eyes,
POCAHONTAS CARRIES VENISON TO JAMESTOWN.  saying that Powhatan would kill her if he knew of her coming there.  These
are the stories told of her in Captain Smith's history.
And when a number of white men then in the Indian
country were put to death, she saved the life of a white
boy named Henry Spelman by sending him away.
When Captain Smith had been in the colony two years,
36ships came from London with many hundreds of people.
The ships that brought this company to Jamestown in
I609 were under the command of men that were enemies
of Captain Smith, who had come to be governor of the
colony. These men resolved to depose John Smith, so
as to get the government of Jamestown into their own
hands.  Smith, having been injured by an explosion of
gunpowder, consented to go back to England. His enemies sent charges against him. One of these charges was
that he wished to marry Pocahontas, who was now growing up, and thus to get possession of the colony by claiming it for the daughter of Powhatan, whom the English
regarded as a kind of king.
The colony had every reason to be sorry that Captain
Smith was sent away.  The men left in charge managed
badly, Powhatan ceased to be friendly, and his little daughter did not come to see the English people any more.
The people of Jamestown were now so afraid of the Indians that they dared not venture outside the town. Soon
all their food was gone, and they had eaten up their horses.
Some of the people were killed by the Indians; some fled
in one of the ships and became pirates; and great numbers of them died of hunger.
Ships arrived at last, bringing help to the colony.
Under one governor and another Jamestown suffered many
troubles from sickness and from the Indians. There was in
the colony a sea captain named Argall, who thought that,
if he could get Pocahontas into his power, her father, the
great chief Powhatan, might be persuaded to be peaceable.

eighteen. She was visiting an old chief named Japazaws,
who lived on the Potomac River.  Argall was trading with
the Indians at Japazaws's town. He told Japazaws that, if
he would bring Pocahontas on board his ship, he would
give him a copper kettle.  Every Indian wanted to have a

stayed a year.
The English people in Jamestown refused to give her up
unless Powhatan would return some guns which the Indians had taken.  There was an Englishman living at
Jamestown, named John Rolfe, who fell in love with Pocahontas, and proposed to marry her.  When  word was sent
to Powhatan of this, he readily agreed to the marriage, and
an old uncle and two brothers of Pocahontas went down
to Jamestown to attend the wedding. Pocahontas, having
38been instructed in the Christian religion, was baptized in
the little church, and married to Rolfe in I614. Her real
name was Matoax, but her father called her Pocahontas.
When she was baptized, she took the name of Rebecca.
THE WEDDING OF POCAHONTAS.
The marriage of Pocahontas brought peace with the
Indians.  In I6i6, with her little baby boy, Pocahontas
was taken to England.  Here she was called "the Lady
Rebecca," and treated with great respect as the daughter
of a king.
The people at Jamestown had told Pocahontas that John
Smith was dead. When she saw him alive in England, she
39was very much offended.  She fell into such a pout that for
some time she would not speak to anybody.  Then she
announced her intention of calling Captain Smith her father,
after the Indian plan of adoption.
She was greatly petted by the king and queen and all
the great people.  The change from a smoky bark hut
to high life in England must have been very great, but
she surprised everybody by the quickness with which
she learned to behave rightly in any company.  She was
much pleased with England, and was sorry to go back.
When she was ready to sail, she was attacked by smallpox, and died.
Her little boy was now left in England. Captain Argall,
who had made Pocahontas prisoner, was now made Governor of Virginia.  He was a very dishonest man, and he
and some partners of his appear to have had a scheme to
get possession of the colony by claiming it for the child of
Pocahontas as the grandson of "King Powhatan." Argall
sent word to England that the Indians had resolved to sell
no more land, but to keep it all for this child. This was, no
doubt, a falsehood.  Argall was a bad governor, and he was
soon recalled, and a better man took his place.  The son of
Pocahontas returned to Virginia when he was grown.
But when Pocahontas was dead, and Powhatan also,
there was nothing to keep the Indians quiet, and in 1622
they suddenly fell upon the settlement and killed more
than three hundred people in one day.  Long and bloody
wars followed, but the colony of Virginia lived through
them all.

4IVIII.
Henry Hudson.
THREE hundred years ago England was rather poor
in people and in money. Spain had become rich and important by her gold mines in the West Indies and the central parts of America.  Portugal had been enriched by
finding a way around Africa to India, where many things
such as silks and spices were boughlt to be sold ill Europe
at high prices. Some thoughtful men in England had aln
idea that as tile Portuguese had reached India by sailing
round the Eastern Continenlt on the south, the English
might find a way to sail to India around the northern
part of Europe and Asia.  By this means the English
42ships would also be able to get the precious things to
be found in the East.
For this purpose some London merchants founded the
Mus'-co-vy Company, with old Sebastian Cabot at its head.
This Muscovy Company had not succeeded in finding a
way to China round the north of Europe, but in trying
to do this its ships had opened a valuable trade with Russia [rush'-ah], or Muscovy as it was then called, which was
a country but little known before.
One of the founders of this Muscovy Company was a
rich man named Henry Hudson.  It is thought that he
was the grandfather of Henry Hudson, the explorer.  The
merchants who made up this company were in the habit
of sending out their sons, while they were boys, in the
ships of the company, to learn to sail vessels and to gain
a knowledge of the languages and habits of trade in distant countries. Henry was sent to sea while a lad, and was
no doubt taught by the ship captains all about sailing vessels. When he grew to be a man, he wished to make himself famous by finding a northern way to China.
In the spring of I607, almost four months after Captain
Smith had left London with the colony bound for Jamestown, his friend Hudson was sent out by thle Muscovy Company to try once more for a passage to China.  He had
only a little ship, which was named Hopewell, and he had
but ten men, including his own son John Hudson.  He
found that there was no way to India by the north pole.
But he went farther north than any other man had gone.
Hudson made an important discovery on this voyage.
43He found whales in the Arctic Seas,          -?.
and the Muscovy Company now fitted  -=3
out whaling ships to catch them. The
next year the brave Hudson tried to
pass between  Spitz-berg'-en and Nova
Zembla [no'-vah zem'-blah], but he was again turned back
by the walls of ice that fence in the frozenl pole.
By this time the Muscovy Company was discouraged,
and gave up trying to get to India by going round
the north of Europe.  They thought it better to make
money out of the whale fishery that Hudson had found.
But in Holland there was the Dutch East India Company, which sent ships round Africa to India. They had
heard  of the voyages of Hudson,
who had got the name of "the
bold Englishman."  The Dutch
Company was afraid th at the
English, with Hudson's help,
might find a nearer way by
the north, and so get the
trade away from  them.  So
they sent for " the bold Englishman,  and hired him to find
this new route for them.

ceived a, letter from his friend Captain John Smith, in
Virginia, telling him that there was a strait leading into
the Pacific Ocean, to the north of Virginia.  Hudson persuaded his men to turn about and sail with him to America
to look for the way to India that Smith had written about.
So they turned to the westward and sailed to Newfoundland, and thence down the coast until they were opposite
James River. Then Hudson turned north again, and began
to look for a gateway through this wild antd unknowvn coast.
He sailed into Delaware Bay, as ships do now on their way
to Philadelphia. Then he sailed out again and followed the
shore till he came to the opening by which thousands of
ships nowadays go into New York.
He passed into New York Bay, where no vessel had
ever been before. He said it was "a very good land to fall
45in with, and a pleasant land to see."  The
New Jersey Indians swarmed about the ship
dressed in fur robes and feather manitles, and
wearing copper necklaces. Hudson thought
some of tihe waterways about New York
harbor must lead into the Pacific.
He sent men out in a boat to examine the
bays and rivers.  They declared that the
land was "as pleasant with grass and flowers as ever they had seen, and very sweet
smells."  But before they got back, some
Indians attacked the boat and killed one
man by shooting him with all arrow.
Wllen the Indians came round the      i
ship again, Hudson minade two of them
prisoners, and dressed them up in
red coats. The rest he drove away.  
As he sailed farther up from the
sea, twenty-eight dugout
canoes filled with men,
women, and children,
paddled about the ship.
The white men traded
with them, giving them
trinkets for oysters and
beans, but none were
allowed to come aboard.
As the ship sailed
46on up the river that we now call the Hudson, the two
Indian prisoners saw themselves carried farther and farther
from  their home.  One morning they jumrnped out of a
porthole and swamn ashore, without even stopping to say
good-by. They stood on the bank and mocked the men
on the Half Moon as she sailed away up the river.
Hudson's ship anchored again opposite the Catskill
Mountains, and here he found some very friendly Indians,
who brought corn
pumpkins, and tobacco to sell to the
crew. Still farther  
up the river Hudson
visited a tribe  on
shore, and wondered
at their great heaps
of corn and beans.
The chief lived in a
round bark house.
Captain Hudson was
made to sit on a
mat and eat from a red wooden bowl.  The Indians wished
him to stay all night; they broke their arrows and threw
them into the fire, to show their friendliness.
Hudson found the river growing shallower.  When he
got near where Albany now stands he sent a rowboat yet
higher up. Then he concluded that this was not the way
to the Pacific. He turned round and sailed down the river,
and then across the ocean to England.  The Half Moon

-. ~- 47returned to Holland, and the Dutch sent out other ships to
trade in the river which Hudson had found.   In the course
of time they planted a colony where New York now stands.
Captain Hudson did not try to go round the north of
Europe any more.  But the next spring he sailed in an
English ship to look for a way round the north side of
the American Continent.  On this voyage he discovered
the great bay that is now called Hudson Bay.
In this bay he spent the winter. His men suffered from
hunger and sickness.  In the summer of I6II, after he had,
with tears in his eyes, divided his last bread with his men,
these wicked fellows put him into a boat with some sick
sailors and cast them all adrift in the great bay.
The men on the ship shot some birds for food, but in a
fight with the Indians some of the leaders in the plot against
Hudson were killed. The seamen, as they sailed homeward, grew so weak from hunger that they had to sit down
to steer the vessel.  When at last Juet, the mate, who had
put Hudson overboard, had himself died of hunger, and all
the rest had lain down in despair to die, they were saved by

48IX.
Captain Myles Standish.
THIRTEEN years after the first settlement at Jamestown a colony was planted in New England.  We have
seen that the rough-and-ready John Smith was the man
who had to deal with the Indians in Virginia.  So the
first colony in New England had also its soldier, a brave
and rather hot-tempered little man-Captain Standish.
Myles Standish was born in England in I584.  He became a soldier, and, like John Smith, went to fight in the
Low Country-that is in what we now call Holland-which
was at that time fighting to gain its liberty from Spain.
The Government of Holland let people be religious in
their own way, as our country does now. In nearly all
other countries at that time people were punished if they
did not worship after the manner of the established church
of the land. A little band of people in the north of England had set up a church of their own. For this they
were persecuted.  In order to get away from their troubles
they sold their houses and goods and went over to Holland. These are the people that we now call "the Pilgrims," because of their wanderings.
Captain Standish, who was also from the north of England, met these countrymen of his in Holland.  He liked
their simple service and honest ways, and he lived among
them though he did not belong to their church.
The Pilgrims remained about thirteen years in Holland. By this time they had made up their minds to seek
49a new home in the wild woods of Amnerica.  About a hundred of them  bade the rest good-by and sailed for America  in  the  Mayflower in
I620.  As  there  might...........           be   so me    fighting   to?~?~i\~ ~ ~do,  the  brave  sol

marched along the shore looking
for a place to settle.  In one spot they found the ground
freshly patted down.  Digging here, they discovered Indian baskets filled withl corn.  Indian corn is an American
plant, and they had never before seen it.  The beautiful
grains, red, yellow, and whlite, wvere a" goodly sight," as
they said. Some of this corn they took with them to plant
the next spring.  The Pilgrims paid the Indians for this
seed corn when they found the right owners.
Standish made his next trip in a boat. This time he
found some Indian wigwams covered and lined with mats.
In December, Captain Standish made a third trip along
the shore. It was now so cold that the spray froze to the
clothes of his men while they rowed.  At night they slept
behind a little barricade made of logs and boughs, so as
to be ready if the Indians should attack them.
50One morning some of the men carried all their guns
down to the water-side and laid them in the boat, in order
to be ready for a start as soon as breakfast should be finished. But all at once there broke on their ears a sound
they had never heard before. It was the wild war whoop
of a band of Indians whose arrows rained around Standish and his men.  Some of the men ran to the boat for
their guns, at which the Indians raised a new yell and
sent another lot of arrows flying after them.  But once
the white men were in possession of their guns, they fired
a volley which made
a tree to fight it out   i
alone; but when a
bullet struck the tree and sent bits of bark and splinters
rattling about his head, he thought better of it, and ran
after his friends into the woods.
Captain Standish and his men at length came to a
place which John Smith, when he explored the coast, had
called Plymouth [plim'-uth]. Here the Pilgrims found a
safe harbor for ships and some running brooks from
which they might get fresh water.  They therefore selected it for their landing place.  There had once been
an Indian town here, but all the Indians in it had died
of a pestilence three or four years before this time. The
Indian cornfields were now lying idle, which was lucky
5 1for the Pilgrims, since otherwise they would have had to
chop down trees to clear a field.
The Pilgrims landed on the 2ist day of December, in
our way of counting, or, as some say, the 22d.  They
built some rough houses, using paper dipped in oil instead of window  glass.  But the bad food and lack of
warm  houses or clothing brought on a terrible sickness,
so that here, as at Jamestown, one half of the people died
in  the  first year.   Captain Standish lost his wife,
but he himself was well
enough to be a kind nurse
to the sick.   Though he
was born of a high family,
he did not neglect to do
the hardest and most disagreeable  work  for  his
sick and dying neighbors.
As there were not many
houses, the people in Plymouth were divided into
nineteen families, and the
single men had to live with
one or another of these
families.   A  young  man
named John Alden [awl'den] was assigned to live in
Captain  Standish's house.
A PURITAN MAIDEN.    Some time after Standish's
52wife died the captain thought he would like to marry a
young woman named Priscilla Mullins.  But as Standish
was much older than Priscilla, and a rough-spoken soldier
in his ways, he asked his young friend Alden to go to the
Mullins house and try to secure Priscilla for him.
It seems that John Alden loved Priscilla, and she did
not dislike him. But Standish did not know this, and poor
Alden felt bound to do as the captain requested. In that
day the father of the young lady was asked first. So Alden
went to Mr. Mullins and told him what a brave man Captain Standish was.  Then he asked if Captain Standish
might marry Priscilla.
"I have no objection to Captain Standish," said Priscilla's father, " but this is a matter she must decide."
So he called in his daughter, and told her in Alden's
presence that the young man had come to ask her hand
in marriage with the brave Captain  Standish.  Priscilla
had no notion of marrying the captain.  She looked at
the young man a moment, and then said:
"Why don't you speak for yourself, John?"
The result was that she married John Alden, and Captain Standish married another woman.  You may read this
story, a little changed, in Longfellow's poem called " The
Courtship of Miles Standish."

Myles Standish and the Indians.'S  X THE  Indians, having got one taste of the
firearms of the white  men, were  afraid  to
attack  Plymouth.  But they thought that;, ~;      they might get rid of the white men by
witchcraft.  So they held what they called!?;i~~      a "powwow" in a big swamp, to peri    1'  suade the spirits to kill or drive away

the  Plymouth  people  had all been  killed

But ill the spring a chief from a place farther east
came to visit the Indians near Plymouth.   He had met
English fishermen and learned a little English.   He was
not afraid to visit the white men.   Walking boldly into
54the little town, he said, "Welcome, Englishmen."
The Pilgrims were surprised to hear two English
words from the mouth of an Indian.
They treated this Indian well, and he came again
bringing an Indian named Squanto [squont-to] who
could speak more English.  Squanto, who had lived
at Plymouth, was one of the Indians carried away
to Spain by Captain Hunt.  From  Spain he had
been taken to England, and then brought back to
America. When he got home to Plymouth he found
that all tile people of his village had died of the
INDIAN pestilence.

BOW    Squanto now came again to the old home of his
AND
ARROW. people at Plymouth and lived with the Pilgrims. He
showed the English a way to catch eels by treading
them out of the mud with his feet. He knew
the woods and waters well, and he showed
them how to hunt and fish. He taught them
how to plant Indian corn as the Indians did,  
putting a fish or two in every hill for manure, and then watching the fields for a while  E  
to keep the wolves from  digging up the
buried fish. Without the seed corn and the
help of Squanto the whole colony would
have starved.
Squanto liked to make himself important    SQUANTO
among the Indians by boasting of the power    CATCHING EELS
of his friends the white men.  He talked about the dread
ful gunpowder kept in the cellar at Plymouth.  He also
55told them that the horrid pestilence was kept in the same
cellar with the powder.
Massasoit [mas'-sa-soit], the chief of Squanto's tribe,
came to see the Pilgrims, bringing some other Indians with
him. They were taken into the largest house in Plymouth
and seated on a green mnat and some cushions. The Governor of the colony was then brought in while the trumpets were blowing and the drums beating.  This parade
pleased the Indians, but they were much afraid of the
Plymouth people. Afterwards the Pilgrims sent Massasoit a
red cotton coat and a copper chain, and by degrees a firm
friendship was made between him and the white mein.
Captain Standish was a little man, and one of his enemies once nicknamed him "Captain Shrimp." But the
Indians soon learned to be afraid of him.  When a chief
near by threatened to trouble the Pilgrims and kill Squanto, Standish marched to the spot and surrounded his wigwam.  Having fired on the Indians and frightened them,
he took three whom he had wounded back to Plymouth
with him. The white people cured their wounds and sent
them home again.
The Nar-ra-gan'-sett Indians were enemies of Massasoit.
None of their people had died of the pestilence, and they
were therefore stronger than Massasoit's tribe. The Narragansetts sent a bundle of arrows to Plymouth tied up in a
snake's skin.  Squanto told the English that this meant to
say that they would come and make war on Plymouth.
The Pilgrims filled the snake's skin with bullets, and sent
it back. This was to say, "Shoot your arrows at us and wewill kill you with our bullets." The Narragan-  
setts were so afraid of the bullets that they sent
them back to Plymouth, and there was no war.
When the Pilgrims had been settled at Plymouth more than a year, a shlip brought them news
of the dreadful massacre that had taken place in
Virginia. The Pilgrims were afraid something
of the kind might happen to them. So Cap-  
tain Standish trained the Plymouth men, and
they kept guard every night. They put can-  
non on the roof of their meetinghouse and
carried their guns to church.
A company of people from England made a
settlement at Weymouth [way'-muth], not very
far from Plymouth. They were rude and familiar, and the Indians soon despised them. Some
Indian warriors made a plan to kill them all.
They intended to kill the Plymouth people at
the same time. But Massasoit told the Pilgrims
about it, and said they must go and kill the leaders before they had a chance to kill the white men.
Captain Standish set out for the colony at
Weymouth. He took but few men, so that the
Indians might not guess what he came for. But
they saw that the little captain was very" angry
in his heart," as they said. Seeing how few his
men were, they tried to frighten him.
One of these Indians named Wittamut sharpened the knife which he wore hanging about hisIN preparing a first book of American history, it is necessary to
keep in mind the two purposes such a work is required to serve.
There are children whose school life is brief; these must get all the
instruction they are to receive in their country's history from a book
of the grade of this.  To another class of pupils the first book of
American history is a preparation for the intelligent study of a textbook more advanced.  It is a manifest waste of time and energy
to require these to learn in a lower class the facts that must be restudied in a higher grade. Moreover, primary histories which follow the order of larger books are likely to prove dry and unsatisfactory condensations.   But a beginner's book ought before all
things else to be interesting.  A fact received with the attention
raised to its highest power remains fixed in the memory; that which
is learned listlessly is lost easily, and a lifelong aversion to history
is often the main result produced by the use of an unsuitable textbook at the outset.
The main peculiarity of the present book is that it aims to teach
children the history of the country by making them acquainted
with some of the most illustrious actors in it. A child is interested,
above all, in persons. Biography is for him the natural door into
history. The order of events in a nation's life is somewhat above
the reach of younger pupils, but the course of human life and the
personal achievements of an individual are intelligible and delightful. In teaching younger pupils by means of biography, which is
the very alphabet of history, we are following a sound principle often
forgotten, that primary education should be pursued along the line
iiineck. While sharpening it he said to Captain Standish:
"This is a good knife.  On the handle is the picture of a
woman's face.   But I have another knife at home with
which I have killed both Frenchmnen and Englishmen.
That knife has a man's face on it. After a while these two
will get married."
A large Indian named Pecksuot said: "You are a captain, but you are a little man.  I am not a chief, but I am
strong and brave."
It was now a question whether Standish would attack
the Indians or wait for them  to begin.  One day when
Wittamut, Pecksuot, and two other Indians were in the
room with Standish and some of his men, the captain made
a signal, and himself snatched the knife
that hung on Pecksuot's neck and stabbed
him  to death  after a terrible struggle.
His men killed the other Indians in the
same way.  The rest of their tribe
fled to the woods for fear, and
after  that  the  English
were  called  "stabbers"
in the Indian language.

might need.
A few years after the Pilgrims settled Plymouth people
began to settle near them, and in I630 there came over a
large number of people, who founded Boston and other
Massachusetts towns.   Captain Standish lived to be more
than seventy years old and to see many thousands of people

XIo
William Penn.
WILLIAM  PENN, who founded Pennsylvania, was born in
London, England, in I644.  He was the only son of Admiral
William  Penn.  Admiral Penn had become a captain before
he was twenty, and had distinguished himself in naval bat59ties. He was a rich man, lived fashionably, and was received at court. Hie wanted to make his son William a
man of importance in the world like himself.  So William
Penn was carefully educated.  When he was at Oxford he
heard a man named Thomas Loe preach against such things
as the wearing of gowns by students.  It had been the custom for the students in the col-',~'  leges at Oxford to wear gowns;
but the Puritans, who ruled
dents were again required to
-put on gowns. Under the inTEARING OFF A STUDENT'S GOWN.    fluence of Loe's preaching, Penn
and some other young men refused to dress in this way,
and they even went so far as to tear off the gowns of other
students.  For this Penn was expelled from the university.
William  Penn's father was very angry wth his son
when he came home expelled.  He was afraid that his son
would join the Friends, or Quakers, who not only refused
to take part in the ceremonies of the English Church, but
also refused to serve the king as soldiers, believing war to
be wicked. They would not make oath in court, nor would
they take off their hats to anybody. Admiral Penn did not
like to see his son adopt the opinions and ways of a people
so much despised and persecuted.
6oHoping that William would forget these impressions, he
sent him to France. Here young Penn was presented at
the court of Louis XIV, and here he finished his education. He then traveled in Italy, and returned to England
when he was twenty years old.   His father was well
pleased to see that he had improved in manners, and
seemed to have forgotten his Quaker ideas.
He was presented at the court of Charles II, and became
a law student. He also carried dispatches from his father's
fleet to the king. In I665 the plague broke out in London,
and in these sad times William Penn's religious feelings
began to return.
His father, hoping to give him something else to think
about, sent him to Ireland to attend to some land which
belongTed to the admiral.  Here he was presented at the
court of the viceroy, the Duke of Ormond.
He served as a soldier for a little while during anl insurrection. You will see that his /

time. But while Penn was in Ireland, he heard that Thomas Loe,
whose preaching had affected him so
much when he was a student, was to _
preach in Cork. Penn went to hear  
him; all his old feelings revived, and he

became a Friend. He now attended the
meetings of the Friends, or Quakers, for which he was at
length arrested and thrown into prison with the rest of thecongregation.  He was afterwards set free.  His father,
hearing of what his son had been doing, sent for him.
Admiral Penn was very angry with William, but he told
himln that he would forgive him
 __,~.e ~everything else if he would take
3~-~    - ~      ~  off his hat to his father, to the
king, and to the king's broth~^  ifer, the Duke of York. Will-,''  iam took some time to think

this.  The admiral then turned
his son out of doors.  But his

home, but not to see his father.
William Penn presently began to preach and write in
favor of the doctrines of the Friends.  He soon got into
trouble, and was imprisoned in the Tower
of London for eight months. The,--

of William Penn's father, and,e,

62L K~

would not bring in any verdict but that he was guilty of
speaking in the street.
The judges were very angry with the jury, but the
jurymen would not change their verdict.  The judges of
that day were very tyrannical. The jurymen in this case
were fined, and sent to prison along with William Penn,
who was imprisoned for wearing his hat in court.  Soon
after Penn was released, his father died.   The admiral
asked the Duke of York to befriend his son, who, he
feared, would always be in trouble.
Penn now traveled in England, Wales, Ireland, Holland,
and Germany, on his preaching journeys. He used all the
63
(iWILLIAM PENN.
influence he had at court with the king and the king's
brother, the Duke of York, to get Quakers and other persecuted people out of prison.
The American colonies had come to be a place for people of all religions to flee to when they were troubled in
England. Some members of the Society of Friends-Penn
among others-began to be interested in West Jersey, a
part of what is now the State of New Jersey, as a place
of refuge for Quakers.
The English Government owed Penn's father a large
sum  of money.  Charles II was in debt, and founid it hard
to pay what he owed, so at length Penn persuaded the
king to grant him  a tract of lanid on the west side of the
Delaware River.  The king
named this Pennsylvania,
in honor of Admiral Penn.
William Penn made the laws of
his colony such that nobody in it
would be troubled because of his
religion. He sent some colonists

in  when they first reached Pennsylvania. Penn himself came the
next year, and laid out a city, naming it Philadelphia,
which means" Brotherly Love."
William Penn managed the Indians well, and for many
years after his death Pennsylvania had no wars. Penn made
a treaty with the Indians under a large elm, in I682. Thewoods were filled with savages, all armed and painted.
The Quakers were but a handful. They wore neither weapons nor ornaments, except that
Penn had a sky-blue sash around
his waist. The Indians seated themselves on the groundo
around their various chiefs
in the form  of half-moons.  
When Penn was a young
man  he had  been famous
for his skill in jumping and
other  exercises.   Findin,
the  Indians engaged  in a
jumping match one day, he
took  part with them, and                               s
they were much pleased to

share in their sport.  Pennsylvania grew much faster than
any of the other colonies.   The government established
by Penn  was free, the Indians were friendly, and the
land was sold in small farms, so that poor men could own
their farms.  People, therefore, liked to settle in Penn's
colony.
After two years William Penn went back to England.
King Charles II died soon after.  William  Penn's friend,
the Duke of York, now became king as James II, and Penn
was seen a great deal in the palace. He got the Friends
relieved from all their troubles, but he came to be hated a
great deal by those who disliked King James. When this
65king was driven from England, and King William and
Queen Mary were set up in his stead, Penn was very
much suspected of wishing to bring James back.  He was
arrested several times, but nothing could be proved against
him.   The control of Pennsylvania was taken  from  him
also, but this was afterwards restored.
Penn returned to Pennsylvania in I699.   He was once
taking a journey through his province when he met a little
girl named Rebecca Wood going to "meeting" on  foot.
He took the little girl up behind him on his horse, and the
great proprietor of Pennsylvania was seen riding gravely
along with the bare legs and feet of a poor little girl dangling at his horse's side.
Penn returned again to England, and, after many years,
died in I7I8.   His descendants appointed the governors of
Pennsylvania until the Revolution.

King Philip.
WHEN the Pilgrims first came to New England they
found that the nearest tribe of Indians, the Wam-pa-no'-ags,
of which Massasoit was chief, had been much reduced in
number by a dreadful sickness. The bones of the dead lay
bleaching on the ground.
The next neighbors to the Wampanoags were the Narragansetts.  These had not been visited by the great sickness, but were as numerous and strong as ever. Massasoit
was, therefore, very glad to have the English, with their
strange guns and long swords, near him, to protect his people from the Narragansetts.
The two sons of Massasoit had been named by the white
people Alexander and Philip, and they were very proud of
their names. These young men remained friendly to the
settlers for some time after their father's death. But many
things made the Indians discontented.  They readily sold
their lands to the white people for blankets, hatchets, toys,
and such things. The ground was all covered with woods,
and, as they used it only for hunting, it was of little value.
67of the least resistance.  Moreover, nothing is more important to the
young American than an acquaintance with the careers of the great
men of his country.
The superiority of works of history in our time over those of
other ages lies in the attention given to the development of the life
of the people as distinguished from the mere recital of public
events. The biographical method here adopted offers a great advantage, by giving the younger pupil interesting glimpses of life in
other times by means of personal anecdote.  The usages of European courts, the dwellings and arts of the Indians, the struggles
of pioneers in the wilderness, the customs of the inmates of frontier
houses, the desolations of the early wars with the savages, the home
spinning and other domestic handicrafts, the stately manners and
ostentatious dress of our forefathers, and many other obsolete phases
of life, are vividly suggested to the pupil's mind, not by dry didactic
statements, but in unforgettable stories of real people. This line
of instruction is much furthered by the running comment of the
accompanying illustrations.
It has often been lamented that no adequate provision is made
in a school course for teaching the principles of morality. But the
teaching of abstract principles is generally unavailing to produce
good conduct.  In the preparation of the present work I have
been surprised to find how abundant are the materials for moral
instruction by example in the careers of our great men. The perseverance of Columbus, of Hudson, and of Morse, the fortitude
of John Smith, of Standish, and of Boone, can not but excite the
courage of those who read the narratives of their lives.  No intelligent pupil will follow the story of Franklin's industrious pursuit
of knowledge under difficulty without a quickening of his own
aspirations. What life could teach resolute patience, truth-telling,
manly honor, and disinterested public spirit better than that of
Washington? And where will a poor lad struggling with poverty
find more encouragement to strictest honesty, to diligent study,
ivBut when they saw how muchl the white men made out of
it they wished to be paid over again.
Many of this tribe of Indians became Christians through
the preaching of John Eliot, who was called "The Apostle
to the Indians."  These were called " praying Indians."
They settled in villages anld tried to live like white people,
though they continued to dwell in bark houses, because
they found that the easiest way to clean house was to leave
the old one and build a new one. They no longer followed
their chiefs or respected the charms of the medicine men.
It made the great men among the Indians angry to see their
people leave them.
The young chief Alexander began to show  ill feeling
toward the white people. The rulers of Plymouth Colony.~'e              ),I  took harsh measures with him. They
sent some soldiers and brought him

ARREST OF ALEXANDER.    the white people heard that Alexander's brother, Philip, was sharpening hatchets and knives.
They immediately sent for him, and forced him and his
men to give up the seventy guns they had brought with
68them.  They also made Philip promise to send in all the
other guns his men had.
When the white people first came, the Indians had nothing to shoot with but bows and arrows.  In Philip's time

common, dirty wigwam, and
was probably often in need of food, he was called King
Philip, and he proudly called himself a king and thought
himself as great a man as the King of England. He had a
coat made of shell beads, or wampum. These beads were
made  by breaking and polishing little bits of hard-clam
shells, and then boring a hole through them with a stone
awl, as you see in the picture.  Wampum -was used for
money among the Indians, and even among the white people at that time. Such a coat as Philip's was very valuable.
Philip dressed himself, also, in a showy red blanket; he
wore a belt of wampum about his head and another long
belt of wampum around his neck, the ends of which dangled
nearly to the ground.
6
69The quarrel between the white people and the Indians
grew more bitter. An Indian, who had told the white men
of Philip's plans, was put to death, probably by Philip's
order.  The white people hanged the Indians who had
killed their friend.
The Indians under Philip were now resolved on war.
But their medicine men, or priests, who pretended to talk
with spirits, told them that whichever side should shed
the first blood would be beaten in the war. The Indians
burned houses and robbed farms, but they took pains not
to kill anybody, until a white man had wounded an Indian. Then, when blood had been shed, they began to kill
the white people.
This Indian war broke out in I675. The New England
people lived at that time in villages, most of them not very
far from the sea.  The more exposed towns were struck
first. The people took refuge in strong houses, which were
built to resist the Indians.  But everywhere those who
moved about were killed.  Some were shot in going for
water, others were slain as they ran out after the savages
had set fire to their houses.
The white men sent out troops, but the Indians some70times waylaid soldiers and killed them suddenly.  Philip
cut up his fine wampum coat and sent the bead money of
which it was made to neighboring chiefs to persuade them
to join him. Soon other tribes, anxious to share in the
plunder and slaughter, entered the fight.
As the Indians grew bolder, they attacked the white
men in their forts or blockhouses.  At Brookfield they
shot burning arrows on the roof of the blockhouse, but
the white men tore off the shingles and put out the
fire. Then the savages crept up and lighted a fire under
one corner of the house; but the men inside made a
dash and drove back the enemy and put the fire out.
Then the Indians made a cart with a barrel for a wheel.
They loaded this with straw and lighted it, and backed
the blazing mass up against the house, sheltering themselves behind it. Luckily a shower came up at that moment and put out the fire.
A very curious thing happened at Hadley.  An old
gentleman named General Goffe was hid away in a house
in that town.  He was one of the judges that had condemned Charles I to death twenty-six years before. When
the son of King Charles I came to be king he put to death
7Isuch of these judges as he could find, and Goffe had to
flee from England and hide. Nobody in the village knew
that Goffe was there, except those who entertained him.

The powerful tribe of the Narragansetts promised to
remain peaceable, but young savages are too fond of war
to miss a chance to engage in a battle. Some of the Narragansetts joined Philip, and their great fort was a refuge
for Philip's men.  They were probably waiting for spring
to come before openly joining in the war.
The white men resolved to strike the first blow against
them while it was yet winter. A thousand men from Massachusetts and Connecticut pushed through the snow and
72made a desperate assault by night on the Narragansett
town, which was inside a fortification having but one
entrance, and that by a bridge.   Nearly two hundred of
the white men were killed in this fight, and many hundreds of Indians were slain, and their fort and all their
provisions were burned. The white men marched back,
carrying their wounded through the bitter cold.
The Narragansetts took a terrible revenge. They joined
Philip at once.  Towns were now burned and people killed

Captain Church in Philip's War.
THE white men had not learned how to fight the Indians, who moved swiftly from place to place, and hid
themselves in the darkest swamps.  But at last the man
was found who could battle with the Indians in their own
way. TIhis was Captain Benjamin Church.
Church could not only fight the Indians, but he knew
how to make them  his friends.  One tribe, not far from
his home, was un-....'     hder the control of a
squaw  sachem, or
Indians of hhwoman ch 1         ief.  Her
name was Awashonks.  She and
Benjamin   Church,e'c  till                       were good friends,
and after the war
broke  out Church
tried to go to see
her, but some of the
Indians of her tribe who were friendly to Philip attacked
Church and his men, so that they had to hide behind a
fence till a boat came and took them away.
Later in the war, Church sent word to Awashonks
that he would meet her and four other Indians at a
certain place. But the rulers of Plymouth Colony thought
it too dangerous for Church to go to see the squaw
74sachem.  They would not give him any men for such an
expedition.
However, Church went on his own account, with one
white man and three Indians. He took sdr(e tobacco and a
bottle of rum as presents suited to the taste of this Indian
queen. Church ventured ashore, leaving his canoe to stand
off at a safe distance, so that if he should be killed the men
in the canoe might carry the news to the white people.
Awashonks and the four Indians met him and thanked him
for venturing among them. But soon a great number of
warriors, frightfully painted and armed, rose up out of the
tall grass and surrounded Captain Church.  The captain
knew that if he showed himself frightened he would be
killed.
"Have you not met me to talk about peace?" he said to
Awashonks.
"Yes," said Awashonks.
"When people meet to talk of peace they lay down their
arms," said Captain Church.
The Indians now began to look surly and to mutter
something.
If you will put aside your guns, that will do," said
Church.
The Indian warriors laid down their guns and squatted
on the grass. During the discussion some of them grew
angry, and one fellow with a wooden tomahawk wished to
kill Church, but the others pushed him away. The captain
succeeded in making peace with this tribe, who agreed to
take the side of the English against Philip.
75Awashonks held a war dance after this, and Church attended. The Indians lighted a great bonfire, and moved
about it in rings. One of the braves stepped inside the
circle and called out the name of one of the tribes
8___ ~fighting on Philip's side against the white
people. Then he pulled a firebrand out
of the fire to represent that tribe, and
he made a show of fighting with the firebrand. Every time the name of a tribe
l   ~ g7Pwas called, a firebrand was drawn out
and attacked in this way.
After this ceremony Church could call
on as many of these Indians as he wished
to help him against Philip. With small bands
of these Indians and a few white men Captain Church scoured the woods, capturing a
great many Indian prisoners.
From the prisoners that he took, Church
FIGHTING A FIREBRAND.
chose certain ones and made them  soldiers under him.  He would say to one of these men:
"Come! come! You look wild, and mutter.  That doesn't
matter.  The best soldiers I have got were as wild and
surly as you a little while ago. By the time you've been
one day with me you'll love me, too, and be as active as
any of them."
And it always turned out so. The captain was so jolly,
and yet so bold and so successful, that the savage whom he
chose to help him would presently do anything for him,
even to capturing his own friends.
76At last so many of Philip's Indians were taken that
Philip himself was fleeing from swamp to swamp to avoid
falling into the hands of the white men.  But he grew
fiercer as he grew more desperate. He killed one of his
men for telling him that he ought to make peace with the
white men. The brother of the man whom he killed ran
away from Philip, and came into the settlement to tell the
white people where to find that chief.
Captain Church had just come from chasing Philip to
make a short visit to his wife.  The poor woman had been
so anxious for her husband's safety that she fainted when
she saw him. By the time she had recovered the Indian
deserter came to tell Church where Philip could be found,
and the captain galloped off at once.
Church placed his men near the swamp inll which
Philip was hidden.  The Indians took the alarm and fled.
In running away Philip ran straight toward Church's
hidden men, and was shot by the very Indian whose
brother he had killed. His head was cut off and stuck
up over a gatepost at Plymouth. Such was the ugly custom in that day.
Philip's chief captain, Annawon, got away with a considerable number of Indians. Church and half a dozen of
his Indian scouts captured an old Indian and a young
squaw who belonged to Annawon's party.  They made
these two walk ahead of them carrying baskets, while
Church and his men crept behind them. In this way they
got down a steep bank right into the camp of Annawon,
whose party was much stronger than Church's, But Church

It would be a pity for a country with such examples in her history not to use them for the moral training of the young. The
faults as well as the virtues of the persons whose lives are told
here will afford the teacher opportunities to encourage right moral
judgments.
In the matter of illustrations, the publishers have shown a liberality without precedent, I believe, in the preparation of books of
this class. The talents and skill of some of the most eminent illustrators in America have been brought into requisition to lend a
charm  to the first lessons in American history.  Should this example be generally followed in the preparation of schoolbooks, it
may produce notable results; a general refinement of taste and
feeling ought to follow an early acquaintance with works of real
artistic value.  The pictures have been made under the author's
supervision, and are meant to be essential aids to the pupil rather
than mere decorations.  The younger the pupil the more must
one have recourse to the imagination in teaching. Some of the
pictures convey information additional to that in the text; the
object of most of them is to suggest to the pupil a vivid conception of the narrative.
Perhaps the most novel feature of the book is the system of
picture maps.  To the untrained eye of the younger pupil an ordinary map has not much meaning, but the beautiful and effective
bird's-eye views here first used in a schoolbook will leave a conception in the mind of a child distinct and ineffaceable.
Of course, the mode of studying such a book may be what the
teacher pleases.  Brief suggestions for a topical recitation are appended to each lesson.  Recitations should not be verbal repetitions
of the text; nor should they, in this grade, be precise and exhaustive. If the pupil is taught to give the substance of the narrative in
his own words, it will make him assimilate what he has studied, and
prove a valuable training in thought and expression. Several supervboldly seized the
guns of  the  Indians, which were
stacked together.
I am taken,"
cried Annawon.
"What have you
got for supper?"
asked Church.  "I
have come to sup
with you."
Annawon    ordered  the women
to hurry up supper, and when it
was ready he asked
Church whether he

would have "horse
beef" or" cow beef."  Church preferred to eat cow beef.
The captain told his Indians to stand guard while he
tried to get a nap. But soon all were fast asleep except
Church and Annawon, who lay eying each other. Presently, Annawon got up and walked away. Church moved all
the Indians' guns close to himself. He thought that the old
chief might have gone for another gun, and he lay down
beside the chief's son, so that Annawon could not shoot him
without killing his own son.
But Annawon came back with a bundle in his arms.
He fell on his knees before Church.
78"Great captain," he said, "you have killed Philip and
conquered his country.  I and my company are the last.

XIV.
Bacon and his Men.
IN i676, just a hundred years before the American Revolution, the people of Virginia were very much oppressed by
Sir William Berkeley, the governor appointed by the King of
England.  Their property was taken away by unjust taxes,
and in other ways. The governor had managed to get all
the power into his own hands and those of his friends.
79BACON AND HIS MEN.
This was the time of King Philip's War in New England. The news of this war made the Indians of Virginia
uneasy, and at length th~ Susquehannas and other tribes
attacked the frontiers. Governor Berkeley would not do
anything to protect the people on the frontier, because he
was making a great deal of money out of the trade with
friendly Indians, and if troops were sent against them this
trade would be stopped.
When many hundreds of people on the frontier had
been put to death, some three hundred men formed themselves into a company to punish the Indians. But Berkeley
refused to allow any one to take command of this troop, or
to let them go against the savages.
There was a brilliant young gentleman named Nathaniel
Bacon, who had come from England three years before.
He was a member of the governor's Council, and an educated man of wealth. He begged the governor to let him
lead this company of three hundred men against the Indians; but the cruel and stubborn old governor said, No.
Bacon was sorry for the suffering people.  He went
to the camp of these men, to see and encourage them.
But when they saw him they set up the cry, "A Bacon!
A Bacon! A Bacon!" This was the way of cheering a
man at that day and choosing him for a leader.
Bacon knew that the governor might put him to death
if he disobeyed orders, but he could not refuse these poor
men who had been driven from their homes.  So off he
went at their head to the Indian towns, where he killed
many of the savages.The old governor gathered his friends and started after
Bacon, declaring that he would hang him for going to
war without orders; but while he was looking for him,
the people down by the coast rose in favor of Bacon.
The governor had to make peace with them by promising to let themn choose a new Legislature.
When Bacon got back from the Indian country the
frontier people nearly worshiped him as their deliverer.
They kept guard night and day over his house.  They
were afraid the angry governor would
send men to kill him.

Forty of them  with guns went
down to Jamestown with him in a''5
sloop. With the help of two boats
and a ship the governor captured
Bacon's sloop, and brought Bacon
into Jamestown. But as the angry people were already rising to   GUARDING BACON'S HOUSE
defend their leader, Berkeley was afraid to hurt him. He
made him apologize, and restored him to his place in
the Council.
But that night Bacon was warned that the next day
he would be seized again, and that the roads and river
were guarded to keep him  from  getting away.  So he
took horse suddenly and galloped out of Jamestown inthe darkness.  The next morning the governor sent men
to search the house where he had stayed.  They stuck
turnl to guard the roads and keep Berkeley in.

Jaaking good ones was going onwith five Ihundians crept down
*   angry men at his hack.  The
people refused to help the governor, and Bacon and his men
to a place oly about twenty miles fromed Jamestown. It was theirnd
turde to guard the people. Generalep Bacon promptly in.started for
the Inold governor offered to fight the army. Buto just as heptain
single-handed, but Bacon told him he would not harm
him.  Bacon forced the governor to sign a commission
appointing him  a general. He also made the Legislature
pass good laws for the relief of the people. These laws
were remembered long after Nathaniel Bacon's death, and
were known as " Bacon's Laws."
While this work of doing away with bad laws and
making good ones was going on, the Indians crept down
to a place onily about twenity miles from Jamestown and
murdered the people.  General Bacon promptly started for
the Indian country with his little army.  But, just as he
82was leaving the settlements, he heard that the governor
was raising troops to take him when he should get back; so
he turned about and marched swiftly back to Jamestown.
The governor had called out the militia, but when they
learned that instead of taking them to fight the Indians
they were to go against Bacon, they all began to murmur
"Bacon! Bacon! Bacon!"  Then they left the field and
went home, and the old governor fainted with disappointment. He was forced to flee for safety to the eastern shore
of Chesapeake Bay, and the government fell into the hands
of General Bacon.
Bacon had an enemy on each side of him. No sooner
had Berkeley gone than the Indians again began their murders. Bacon once more marched against them, and killed
many.  He and his men lived on horseflesh and chinquapin
nuts during this expedition.
When Bacon got back to the settlements and had dismissed all but one hundred and thirty-six of his men, he
heard that Governor Berkeley had gathered together seventeen little vessels and six hundred sailors and others, and
with these had taken possession of Jamestown.  Worn out
as they were with fatigue and hunger, Bacon persuaded his
little band to march straight for Jamestown, so as to take
Berkeley by surprise.
As the weary and dusty heroes of the Indian war hurried onward to Jamestown, the people cheered the gallant
little company.  The women called after Bacon, " General, if you need help, send for us!"  So fast did these men
march that they reached the narrow neck of sand that con83nected Jamestown with the mainland before the governor
hlad heard of their coming.  Bacon's men dug trenches in
the night, and shut in the governor and his people.
After a while Bacon got some cannon. He wanted to
put them upon his breastworks without losing the life of
any of his brave soldiers.  So he sent to the plantations
near by and brought to his camp the wives of the chief
men in the governor's party.  These ladies he made to
sit down in front of his works until his cannon were in
place.  He knew that the enemy would not fire on them.
When he had finished
BACON' DEFEhe politely sent them
home.
Great numbers of
the  people now flocked
to   General  Bacon's
standard, and the governor and his followers left Jamestown in
their vessels.   Knowing that they would try
to return, Bacon ordered the town to be

Almost all of the people except those on the eastern
shore sided with Bacon, who now did his best to put the
government in order.   But the hardships he had been
through were too much for him.  He sickened and died.
His friends knew that Berkeley would soon get controlagain, now  that their leader was dead.   They knew  that
his enemies would dig up Bacon's body and hang it, after
the fashion of that time. Therefore they buried it nobody
knows where; but as they put stones into his coffin, they
must have sunk it in the river.
Governor Berkeley got back his power, and hanged
many of Bacon's friends.   But the King  of Englanld removed Berkeley in disgrace, and he died of a broken
heart.  The governors who came after were generally careful not to oppress the people too far.  They were afraid
another Bacon might rise up against them.

Boyhood of Franklin...-----............BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, the fifteenth in a family of seventeen
children, was born in Boston in
__/))          I7o6. Benjamin learned to read
-.__--- #      ~   when he was very young, but he
was sent to school for only two
years. When he was ten years
old he had to help his father.
Franklin's father made his living
by boiling soap  and making
tallow candles. Little Benjamin
had to cut wicks for the canFRANKLIN BEGINS  
H18 EDUCATION.        dles, fill the molds with the melted tallow, tend the shop, and run on errands.  He did
not like the soap and candle trade.  Playing about the
water, he had learned to swim, and to manage a boat, when
he was very young.  Like many other boys, he got the
notion that it would be a fine thing to go to sea and be
a sailor. But his father did not think so.
Franklin and his playmates used to fish for minnows
in a mill pond which had a salt marsh for a shore, so that
the boys had to stand in the mud. He was a leader among
the boys, and already very ingenious.  So he proposed that
the boys should build a little wharf in this marsh to stand
on. Near the marsh there was a pile of stones, put there
to be used in building a new house.  In the evening,
86when the workmen were gone, Franklin and the other
boys tugged and toiled until they had managed to carry
all these stones away and build them into a wharf, or
pier, reaching out into the water.
In the morning the workmen were very much surprised
to find that their pile of stones had walked away during
the night. They soon found out where the stones were,
and complained to the parents of the boys. Franklin and
some of the other boys were punished for their mischief.
Benjamin tried to make his father see that it was a
very useful work to build such a pier, but the father
soon showed him that "nothing was useful that was not
honest. "
When Franklin had worked for two years with his father at the trade of making tallow candles, the father began
to be afraid that Ben would run away and go to sea, as
another of his sons had done before. So Franklin's father
took him to walk with him sometimes, showing him men
working at their trades, such as bricklaying, turning, and
joining, hoping that the boy would take a fancy to one of
these occupations. Meantime, Benjamin became very fond
of reading. He read his father's books, which were very
dull for children, and he sold some little things of his
own to buy more.  As the boy was so fond of books,
Benjamin's father could think of nothing better than to
