PREFACE

SOON after the writer began teaching graduate courses in the
history of education he realized that to determine what was really
taught in the schools of the past one would have to know what
was in the textbooks used in the past. So he became interested in
collecting old textbooks. Inevitably it would be diﬂicult to get
textbooks from many countries, so he tried to gather as complete
a collection as reasonably possible of texts published in America.
However, he also collected many European books which found
their way to America or were reprinted here.

.' This collection now contains more than 8,000 volumes published
before 1900. Roughly it contains about 840 spellers, 850 readers,
400 grammars, SQ5 geographies, 250 American histories, 170
social science books, 120 physiologies, and fewer in other ele-
mentary school subjects. The remainder are rare professional
books, and old secondary school textbooks.

During the years more than thirty doctoral dissertations at the
University of Pittsburgh have been devoted to an analysis of old
textbooks in various ﬁelds. In every instance the writers of these
used not only the relevant texts in the Nietz Collection, but also
those in other appropriate libraries, such as the Library of
Congress, the Plimpton and the Smith Collections at Columbia

University, the New York City Public Library, the Harvard
Library, the Antiquarian Society Library at Worcester, Massa-
chusetts, and many others. Thus the ﬁndings in these studies in
the several ﬁelds reﬂect the nature of the content of old American
school textbooks. Ample use has been made of the ﬁndings of these
studies in the writing of this book. Use has also been made of
studies known to the writer made elsewhere.

Obviously every one who can read has studied some textbooks.
If at all interested in them such persons may also want to know
how these compare with the textbooks of other periods. Thus most
literate persons may ﬁnd it both interesting and proﬁtable to read
about the textbooks of the past and how they have changed from
time to time.

A more technical and professional use may be made of this book
by all interested in the history of education. If not used as a basic
textbook for a course, it surely may be most proﬁtably used as a
supplementary reference book by all students studying the history
of education.

Every American, which we mean to apply to those living in
that part of the Americas now known as the United States, ought
to understand something about the past struggles and develop-
ment of our evolving civilization. Those who greatly helped mold
the beginnings and the continuing development of our American
civilization were the products of the schools of the ‘past. The study
of the textbooks in those schools certainly greatly inﬂuenced their
thinking and ideals. Thus an understanding of the textbooks of
the past should throw considerable light upon the evolution of our
culture and civilization. Certainly the McGuﬁ"ey Readers did
much to mold the character of the culture and ideals of the Middle
West for more than a half century.

The writer is keenly aware that in dealing with thousands of
textbooks of the past it is easy to commit errors of statement.
Such errors may relate to the datesof their .ﬁrst publication,
whether or not the nature and characteristics of certain textbooks
were the ﬁrst to have them and whether or not particular books
were the ﬁrst to appear in a certain ﬁeld. For example, what

Reader first contained pictures or first contained colored pictures ;
or whose was the ﬁrst American textbook in spelling, reading,
geography, arithmetic, grammar, history, civil government, phys-
iology, penmanship, music, and art? The writer merely claims that
he has attempted to be as accurate in his statements as research
known to him warrants.

The writer acknowledges his debt to many persons and libraries.
He is grateful to his colleagues and library staff at the University
of Pittsburgh for their encouragement and cooperation in the
development of the collection and in the pursuance of the many
studies involving the textbooks; to the thousands of students in
his history of education classes who manifested interest in the old
textbooks, and in many cases contributed old books to the col-
lection; to the many other librarians who generously aided the
students carrying on researches of the old textbooks; to the editors
of professional journals who published articles relating to old
textbook studies; and to news reporters who helped publicize the
collection, which in turn resulted in obtaining additional books.
He is also grateful to his wife, Florence, and to a number of
colleagues for having read certain chapters in manuscript form
and made helpful suggestions. Acknowledgment is made of the
help and cooperation of Mr. Thomas Jarrett, University Pho-
tographer, who prepared the pictures appearing in the book, and
to Mrs. Agnes Starrett, Editor of the University of Pittsburgh
Press, for her constant encouragement and editorial assistance.

OLD TEXTBOOKS——
A HISTORY OF EDUCATION

AN analysis of the school textbooks used in the past reveals
a truer history of what was taught in the earliest schools
than does a study of past educational theories alone. This is
particularly true for the early American schools. The teachers
in the early days of our country were so meagerly trained and
educated that they depended strongly -on the textbooks for what
to teach and how to teach. Most authorities agree that in the
United States the old textbooks in use in any particular school
largely constituted the school’s course of study. And so an
analysis of -old American school textbooks reﬂects the evolution

of the American school curriculum and the teaching and learning  

methods.

My study attempts to show only the development of the so-
called “Common School” subjects. The Common School was the
term applied to the schools first established at various dates in
the different states of the Union for all children———the schools
now known as the Elementary Schools. A full chapter is devoted

to each of the following: spelling, reading, grammar, arithmetic,

geography, American history, civics, and physiology; and the
ﬁnal chapter is on penmanship, art, and music. The author

hopes that his second book will present the evolution -of the im-
portant secondary school textbooks.

I have made a serious attempt to present as true a picture as
reasonably possible of the changing nature of American “Com-
mon School” textbooks published before 1900. Two reasons may
be given for selecting the terminal date: (1) Most persons read-
ing this book will be more or less versant with the more recent
textbooks; and (2) the scientiﬁc influence on American educa-
tion began about 1900, causing the textbooks to change mark-
edly after that date.

CHANGING CHARACTERISTICS

Size. In most subject ﬁelds, the older the textbooks the smaller
they were, particularly those used in the elementary level. This
is objectively shown for the texts in several fields in Table I.

The older books not only contained fewer pages, but commonly
the pages were much smaller. For example, the pages of many
of the earliest editions of the New England Primer were 3% by
411/2 inches in size. The pages of 5 the Elements of Geography
(1796) by J edidiah Morse were 3 by 4% inches. Nearly all very

early geography textbooks were small and contained only a few
folded maps, if any at all. However, by the 1880’s geographies
became very large, even larger than they are at present and
contained large maps. *   I

Bindings and Paper. In general, the bindings of the books
intended for elementary children were very different from those
for secondary school youth. For example, most editions of the
New England Primer were bound either in rather limp paper
covers or with very thin wooden boards covered with paper. On
the other hand, most Latin and Greek grammars were bound in
leather. A few were bound with homespun linen over stiff board
covers. In many the leather covered very thin wooden boards.

Most of the earliest spellers were bound either in stiff paper
cardboard with leather spines or in full leather. The later spellers
were commonly bound in stiff paper cardboard covers and cloth
spines. Leather bound books on the elementary level were rare
after 1800. However, the texts for the upper grades and second-
ary schools often continued to appear bound in leather until
about 1850.

Nearly all old textbooks were printed on rag paper. Thus the
paper in texts over 4900 years old is commonly still in rather
good condition. More recent texts commonly are printed on. less
durable pulp paper which ultimately disintegrates. Thus further
textbooks collectors may ﬁnd textbooks difficult to preserve.

Print and Pictures. In general, old textbooks were printed in
much smaller type than the later ones. Two of the oldest readers
Written in America were by Noah Webster and Caleb Bingham.

Webster’s book was printed with 9 point type and Bingham’s
with 8 point. McGuﬁ‘ey’s Primer (1849), as well as most other

primers of that period, was printed with 12 point type. Com-
monly, recent primers are printed with 18 or 24: point type.
Incidentally, the first edition of Webster’s Compendious Dic-
tionary (1806) was printed with 3 point type. It is evident that
printers in those early days knew little of visual hygiene.

Very few textbooks before the 1830’s contained pictures, other
than the pictures illustrating the letters of the alphabet, as was

done in the New England Primer and some early spellers. Then.

4 OLD TEXTBOOKS

Webster’s American Spelling Book, 1809, shows how reading and spell-
ing were a unit. '

in the 1830’s, when the textbooks in several ﬁelds began to appear
in series, usually only the lower ones would contain pictures. One
author was a marked exception; namely, Peter Parley (S. G.
Goodrich). He wrote textbooks in a number of ﬁelds in the 1830’s
and 40’s, and nearly all of them contained many pictures. Some
authors, particularly in history and geography, included a
considerable number of horror pictures. Beginning in the 1850’s
the physiology textbooks began to have more pictures than was
true in other fields. Calvin Cutter’s Physiology in 1852 contained
more than 150 engravings. Other physiologies soon followed a
similar practice. Some even included colored pictures much earlier
than was true in other ﬁelds, particularly showing the blood
vessels and other physical characteristics. Colored pictures did not
appear commonly in readers or in other textbooks until the

1890%.

A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 5

Directions for Teaching. Since the early American teachers were
very poorly prepared for teaching, it was rather common for
textbook authors to include teaching suggestions in their books.
It must be kept in mind that the earliest popular pedagogical
textbook, Lectures on Schoolkeeping, by Samuel Read Hall, was
not published until 1829; and that the ﬁrst public normal school,
at Lexington, Massachusetts, did not open until 1839. So many
early textbooks contained rather extensive and detailed directions
for teaching the subject or using the text. In some instances
these reﬂected peculiar whims of the authors.

a The directions were presented in several ways or places. Most

commonly they appeared in ‘the preface, the introduction, or in a ,

section addressed “To the Teacher.” In some instances, and par-
ticularly in arithmetic books, the helps were presented in the back
of the book. In some arithmetic books approaches for the solution
of the problems even appeared in the back.

Where the skills were to be taught by a particular system,
such as in penmanship, art, and music, many pages of detailed
teaching instructions were common. In‘ fact, in art and penman-
ship entire teachers’ manuals of instructions were common. In
music these instructions were usually very detailed and technical.
Even in a geography textbook by Cummins in 1818, fourteen and
one-half pages were devoted to teaching suggestions.

Learning and Teaching Aids in Textbooks. There have been
marked changes in the practice of including learning and teach-
ing aids in textbooks. With time there has been a steady increase
in their inclusion. Table II shows how many textbooks in certain
subject ﬁelds included them. Unfortunately it would require a
too extensive and complex table to show how the earliest text-
books diifered from the later ones in this regard. However, a
detailed analysis of the studies from which this table is con-
structed would show that the earliest books rather commonly
would contain only either a preface or an introduction or both,
and sometimes a table of contents and an appendix. Early
grammars and geographies rarely contained even a table of
contents. Indexes and references were not too common until the
latter half of the nineteenth century. Except for the very earliest

books, some sort of visual aid——an illustration, picture, table,
chart, graph, or map was rather commonly included, although
often only a few. The use of colored pictures was rare until just
before 1900. Notes and glossaries never became common. The
use of questions was not universal, but the practice was somewhat
constant throughout in all ﬁelds. Not only did the later textbooks
include more learning aids, but these aids improyed in form and
usefulness. I

SOME PECULIARITIES

Printers and Publishers. The earliest American textbooks were
not printed by one particular publishing house, as is common
today. The absence of early copyright laws, railroads, good roads,
and efficient mail service, prevented large scale publishing by
particular ﬁrms. Thus the earliest books were produced by local
printing shops. In the early colonial period the Boston area
printed most textbooks. Later, possibly partly due to Franklin’s
inﬂuence, Philadelphia led in book production. Eventually New
York City took the lead.

Before copyright laws became effective, local printing shops
were not only the printers of books, but also the sellers of them.
Any printer could secure a copy of a popular book and reprint
it for local sale. In many cases more than one local printer would
reprint the same book in the same town. For example, the 36
different copies of Lindlay Murray’s Readers of different dates
and titles in the writer’s collection were printed by 22 different
printing shops, nine of them in Philadelphia. To prevent this
practice Noah Webster attempted to get the federal government
to pass an early copyright law. Since he failed in this, he suc-
ceeded in getting a number of states to enact such laws. Thus he
was able to collect royalties from the local printers in the states
reprinting his books. These royalties aided his family to live while
he was Writing his dictionary. It Was not until after the develop-
ment of railroads that large publishing houses developed which
were to sell and deliver books over the nation.

Advertisements in Textbooks. Even before 1800 a number of text-
books began to contain advertisements listing textbooks in other

8 OLD TEXTBOOKS

sub ect ﬁelds for sale by the sameprinter. In the beginning only
a few printers did this. For example, in the different editions of
the Murray Readers only a few of the printers included advertise-
ments. But beginning in the 1830’s this practice became more
common, and for several decades after 1850 most of them did.

The 1853 edition of Murray’s English Exercises printed by a
Philadelphia ﬁrm contained 25 pages listing textbooks for sale,
together with signed recommendations for them. In 187% Martin-
dale’s Human Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene included 14
pages of advertisements. This practice lessened after 1880.

Testimonials and Recommendations. Even more common than the
practice of including advertisements in textbooks, the earliest
ones contained recommendations for the text in which they ap-
peared. ’Usually these were written by very prominent persons.
For example, Nicolas Pike, before he published his Arithmetic
in 17 88, secured recommendations from four college presidents
and from Benjamin West to be printed in the book. I)aboll’s
Arithmetic (1802) included recommendations by Noah Webster,
John Adams, and several others. ’

The prize example of including numerous endorsements was in
John Jenkins’ The Art of Writing in 1813. It contained en-
dorsements by SZQO persons and recommendations by 109. How-
ever, it should be stated that the signatures of many of these
appeared in groups. Many were signatures of very famous
Americans. For Pittsburghers it may be interesting to know that
one of the editions of Joseph Stockton’s Western Calculator,
which was first printed in Pittsburgh in 1819, contained 25 in-
dividually prepared recommendations in the back of the book.
Among them were Western Pennsylvania’s most prominent
persons of that day, chieﬂy ministers, lawyers, and teachers.
Sanders’ Spelling Book (1838) contained recommendations or
endorsements by 55 persons. .

Interestingly, as the practice of including advertisements in
textbooks increased during the middle of the nineteenth century,
the practice of including recommendations and endorsements
decreased. No doubt, this was true because of the development of
large publishing ﬁrms. In most cases the advertisements would

A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 9

include a description of the purposes and merits of their books,
making separate recommendations less essential.

Great Variation in Content. The content of old textbooks in most
ﬁelds during any particular time varied more than is common
today. Evidently the chief reason was the absence of the existence
of professional societies or organizations, such as the American
Historical Society, American Mathematical Society, and so on,
which now more or less help determine the content of the text-
books in the respective subject ﬁelds. Before the organization of
these societies each author could largely determine what his text
would include and What omit. So individual whims and interests
of the authors greatly determined the nature of the textbooks. In
other words, the authors could be more independent.

Long Titles of Teartbooks. A large fraction of America’s earliest
textbooks had very long titles. These titles often involved both
the purpose and a description -of the book. One marked example
of this practice was Noah Webster’s Reader. Its full title was,
An American Selection of Les-
sons in Reading and Speak-
ing Calculated to Improve the
Miwnds and Reﬁne the Taste
of Youth. And Also to In-

SPELLERS

OMNIB US TEXTBOOKS

HE books from which the colonial children in America
learned to spell were very different from spellers of today.
In fact, when the earliest American schools were opened in
Massachusetts and Connecticut, there were no regular spelling
books. Apparently, whatever words the children learned to spell
in school were from the New England Primer. An examination
of more than a dozen different editions of the Primer reveals that
nearly all of them contained word lists to be spelled. One of the
most popular editions began with the alphabet; followed by 180
syllables, as ab, ac, ad; ba, ca, da; etc. These were followed by a
list of 84 words of one syllable such as age, all, ape, are; 458 words
of two syllables, as absent, abhor, apron; 24 words of three
syllables, as abusing, amending, argument; 21 words of four
syllables, as a-bi-li-ty, af—fec—ti—on; 144 words of ﬁve syllables, as
a-bo—mi-na—ble, ad—mi—ra—ti-on; and 12 words of six syllables, as
a—bo—mi—na—ti-on, gra-ti—ﬁ—ca—ti—on. Peculiar syllabication of the
longer words may be noted.
The next spelling books were those brought by the colonists
from England. These, too, were not entirely devoted to spelling.
One of the earliest, if not the earliest, was Thomas Dilworth’s

A Spelling Book, or N ew Guide, published in England in 1740. It

included grammar, English substantives, etc., in addition to
spelling. This book was later revised and published by Dilworth
under the title of A New Guide to the Eng‘lz'sh Tongue, which
became very popular in England, Irelan_d, and the English
colonies. Later it was reprinted by numerous printers in America
and gained wide circulation. It consists of ﬁve parts, and really
meant to constitute the entire elementary school curriculum.
Much of its content was a correlation or mixture of reading ma-
terial, spelling, grammar, and religious content. Of the 1456 pages
in a fine edition printed in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, in 1801,
41 pages were deﬁnitely spelling, and many other pages were
a mixture of reading and spelling.

In 1767 Daniel Fenning published the Universal S pelllng Book

in London. It was reprinted in Boston in 1767, and in New

12 OLD TEXTBOOKS

York in 1787. However, it never attained the popularity of the
Dilworth books.

George Fox, founder of the Quakers, in 1769 published in
England a book entitled, Instructions for Right Spelling and
Plain Directions for Reading and Writing True English. This
like the others was an omnibus book dealing with different aspects
of English. No doubt, some copies of this book were brought to
America by the Quakers.
Of thespellers first published in England, the one that had
most usage in America, next to Dilworth’s, was written in 1780
by William Perry, a lecturer in the Academy of Edinburgh. To
counteract the inﬂuence of Dilworth’s A New Guide to the Eng-
lish Tongue, Perry entitled his speller, The Only Sure Guide to
The English Tongue, or N ew Pronouncing Spelling Book. It was
more speciﬁcally a spelling book than was Dilworth’s. The famous
colonial printer, Isaiah Thomas, reprinted several editions of this
speller in Worcester, Massachusetts. The sixth edition contained
91 pages of words, carefully
syllabiﬁed and marked for
pronunciation. These matters
received marked attention in
Perry’s S pellcr, since he was
also the author of The Royal
Standard English Dictionary,
which was also first published
in England. The sixth edition
contained 17 pages of “Moral
Tales and Fables”; 39 pages
of grammar; and 33 pages

A of appendix material, consist-
ing of miscellaneous contents;
plus a rather extensive list of
words with deﬁnitions dia-
critically marked.

Kneeland’s Instructor, 1762, spell-
ing and reading taught together.

SPELLERS 13

The last speciﬁc speller to be mentioned among the English
authors is one by Lindley Murray. In fact, Murray was born and
educated in America, but after a rather successful business career
moved to England in 1784:. There after teaching for some time,
he became one of the most successful textbook writers in both
England and United States. His English readers and grammars
were the most widely used in the United States during our early
national period. After writing the grammar and readers, he

published the English Spelling Book with Reading Lessons in

1804. It was meant to be used by beginners and to precede his

English Reader. Although it was reprinted in New York in 1828,
it never became popular here.

Apparently there were other books published in England
containing spelling lessons, but not reaching much circulation
in America. Evidence of this appears in the oldest speller printed
in America in the writer’s collection. It is, The Yonth’s Instructor
in the English Tongue: or, The Art of ‘Spelling I mproved. It was
printed in Boston by D. and J. Kneeland in 1762 for M. Dennis.
A statement on the title page states that it was “Collected from
Dixon, Bailey, Owen, Strong, and Watts.” Evidently the books
of the ﬁve authors mentioned were used from which the contents
of this book were collected. Like books heretofore discussed, it was
more than a speller. Part I of 80 pages was a mixture of spelling
and moral lessons in reading. The syllabication of many of the
words seems strange to us today, for example, spi—ri-tu—a-li—ty
and ple—ni-po—ten—ti-a-ry. Part II of 23 pages was in catechetical
form dealing mainly with matters -of orthography, grammar, and
religion. For example: “Q. How do you pronounce the Con-
sonant c? A. Sometimes hard like k, sometimes soft like s.” Part
III of 46 pages covered “Rules in Arithmetic, with Forms of
Bills, Bonds, Releases,” etc. However, 22 of the 46 pages dealt
with the Bible and other religious content.

The earliest speller printed in America seems to have been
written by Stephen Daye. He was the first to set up a printing
press in America, and in 1639 published the ﬁrst book printed here,
The Free’/nan’s Oath. The Dunster Mss. in Harvard Library list
the books printed by Daye. Between Capital Lawes (1642) and
Winthrope Declaration (1645) there is listed A Spelling Book.

144 OLD TEXTBOOKS

So about in 1643 the first American book in spelling was
published. The lack of the existence of known copies of it in-
dicates that its inﬂuence must have been small.

Thus it can be seen that the children of the American colonies
largely learned spelling either from books originally written in
England or from books mainly copied from them, even though
they were printed here. Too, none of these books were solely
spellers. Usually they were a mixture of spelling, reading, gram-
mar, religion, and even arithmetic. In other words, they could be
characterized as books of correlated or integrated English.

WEBSTER’S BLUE—BACKED SPELLERS

Noah Webster (17 543-1843) was America’s first proliﬁc textbook
writer. In all, he was a teacher, lawyer, popular lecturer, lobbyist,
and lexicographer. As an author he wrote a grammar, and Ameri-
can history, readers, two dictionaries, and numerous patriotic
and civic materials, in addition to the spellers.

In referring to the reason for writing his first so—called speller,
Webster wrote, “I kept a classical school at Goshen, N.Y.
(in 1782). The country was impoverished, intercourse with Great.
Britain was interrupted, and school books were scarce and hardly
attainable, . . .” In addition to the desire to meet a need, he
possessed an even greater urge; namely, to write textbooks that
would be American rather than English. He was a great Ameri-
can patriot. He believed that America should proclaim a Declara-
tion of Independence culturally and academically as well as
politically. . .

Originally he planned to entitle his iﬁrst book, The American
Instructor, which was to be similar to its English predecessors,
a combination of speller, reader, and grammar, but with Ameri-
can word lists and illustrations rather than British. However,
on the advice of Dr. Ezra Stiles, President of Yale, he adopted
a more classical title. Since Webster planned to write several
textbooks, a general title was given the series, with a specific
subtitle for each book. The title became, A Grammatical Institute
of The English Language, Comprising an Easy, Concise, and

SPELLERS 15

Systematic Method of Education, Designed for The Use of
English Schools in America. Part I Containing a N ew and
Accurate Standard of Pronunciation. Part II became an English
Grammar, and Part III An American Selection of Lessons in
Reading and Speaking. Part I has commonly been accepted to be
the speller, although that word does not appear in the title, which
had also been true of some of its English predecessors. It was
first published in Hartford in 1783.

Since there was no federal copyright law when he planned this
series, and even before the speller was completed, Webster began
to tour the states to secure state copyright laws to protect his
forthcoming publications. Eventually he succeeded in getting
such protection in most of the populous states. The royalties he
thus obtained helped maintain him and his family while he was
writing his dictionaries, which were published in 1806 and 1828.

It may be noted that the subtitle of Part I apparently did not
stress spelling, but rather pronunciation, although it has been
commonly mentioned in the history of education as a Speller.
In the main, Webster’s 17 88 edition was strongly patterned after
the two English books fairly popular in America; namely, Dil-
worth’s and Fenning’s. However, certain internal changes were
made. First, I)ilworth’s lists of English place names and abbrevia-
tions were replaced by American names. Next, much of I)ilworth’s
religious content was replaced by precepts of The Poor Richard
(Franklin’s) type. Thirdly, Webster changed the syllabication
of many words in harmony with the developing American ways of
pronouncing words. The suffixes of words ending withiti—on, si—on,
and ci—on were changed to be pronounced as one syllable rather
than two. Also, such words as clu—ster, ha-bit, etc., were changed
to clus-ter and hab-it.

Soon Webster became aware that the long classical title of his
books wasnot well accepted, so in 1787 he changed the title of
Part I (the Speller) to The American Spelling Book. In spite
of the Dilworth and Perry followers, this edition became very
popular. One edition published in Philadelphia in 1809 is the
“Thirtieth Revised Impression,” and a footnote mentions that

over 3,000,000 copies had already been sold. The 1816 edition is

16 OLD TEXTBOOKS

the “Nintieth Revised Impression.” These editions include 168
pages of content. The first 150 pages consist mainly of spelling
with brief moral reading selections interspersed. These editions
end with “A Moral Catechism” of questions and answers on such
matters as humility, mercy, peace—making, purity of heart, anger,
revenge, justice, generosity, gratitude, and truth. “The Moral
Catechism” evidently was included as a substitute for the Puritan
“Catechism” of the N ew England Primer. Webster believed that
only non-sectarian teaching should be given in a country not
having a state religion.

In 1829 a new revised edition appeared as The Elementary
Spelling Book; being an Improvement on The American Spelling
Book. There were several urgent reasons for making this change.
The two earlier S pellers were largely the total primary school
curriculum, consisting of spelling, reading, elements of grammar,
and moral lessons. By the late 1820’s separate textbooks in these
basic ﬁelds had appeared. So it became logical for so-called
spellers to be only spellers. This was true of the new 1829 edition.
All except a few pages consist of spelling words and their use
in sentences. A second reason was because his large American
Dictionary was published in 1828. So the rules governing the
spelling, syllabication, and pronunciation needed revision to be
in full accord with the Dictionary. The purpose was to render
“its orthography more simple, regular, and uniform, and by re—
moving diﬂiculties arising from anomalies.”

The Elementary Spelling Book became the most popular
speller in the United States. As late as the 1866 edition, the out-
side cover included the statement, “more than 1,000,000 copies of
this work are sold annually.” In fact, it was still being published
at the end of the nineteenth century. It is claimed that approxi-
mately 100,000,000 copies of the Webster S pellers were sold.

But why did The Elementary Spelling Book remain so
popular? Of course, by 1829- the Webster name bore great
prestige. In addition, however, it was well prepared. The lessons
were numbered and were presented in logical sequence. For
example, after several pages of syllables using the different vowel
sounds, the spelling words sequentially appear according to

SPELLERS 17

length and vowel sounds, and often with the words used in sen-
tences. In sequence, ﬁrst appear words of three letters with the
short sound of the vowels, then words of four letters and long
vowel sounds. These are followed by words of two syllables be-
ginning with short vowels and changing to long vowels. Thus
a logical sequence follows through-out the book, ending with words
of many letters, syllables, and sounds. However, the arrangement
is more logical and psychological, and the principle of future
word usage is greatly ignored. For example, there are such words
as, ar mig er ous, 0 le ag in ous, ne 0 ter ic, and so cin i an ism.

Although the Webster Spellers have been popularly referred
to as “Blue—Backed,” yet that description was not universally
true. The color of the books was determined by the printers.
The twenty—ﬁve different copies in the writer’s collection were
printed by seventeen different printers. Most of these have blue
covers, but some are brown, gray, green, and even leather covered.

OTHER EARLY SPELLERS

Soon after Webster’s first S peller was printed, a virtual epi-
demic of spellers appeared. In addition to the 1762 American
text, heretofore discussed, several others were published before
1800, and many more soon after. Caleb Bingham, a school master
in Boston, wrote The Child’s Companion, being an Easy and
Concise Reading and Spelling Book in 1792. Like its predeces-
sors, it too contained numerous reading selections, and some
grammar. This book later was reprinted in numerous editions.

In 1795 The New, American Spelling—Book by John Peirce
was published in Philadelphia. Apparently this book was fairly
well received, since its 1808 printing was the Sixth Revised
Edition. It consisted of three parts: Part I contained tables of
common words, Part II dealt with the meanings of words as well
as their spelling, and Part III was “A Practical English
Grammar.”

In 1798 a book was printed for Mathew Carey in Philadelphia
entitled The Colambian Spelling Book, or an Easy or Alluring-
Guide to Spelling and Reading. The long title aimed to describe
both the purpose and the content of the book. To illustrate some

18 OLD TEXTBOOKS

of the moral stories several pictures were presented. This was
not commonly true of the earlier spellers. In 17 99 Caleb Alex-
ander’s The Young Ladies’ and Gentlemen’s Spelling Book
appeared. It also contained reading, fables, and moral sentences.

Immediately after 1800 new spellers appeared in frequent
succession. The Definition Spelling Book by Abner Kneeland was
published in 1802. Later editions added the word American to the
title. This book was really a cross between a speller and a dic-
tionary. According to the title page, “The words are not only
rationally divided into syllables, accurately accented, the various
sounds of vowels represented by ﬁgures, and their parts of speech
properly distinguished, but the deﬁnition or signiﬁcation affixed
to each word.” The lists of words were somewhat classiﬁed accord-
ing to their characteristics.

In 1803 Fiske’s The N ew England Spelling—book was printed
in Brookﬁeld, Massachusetts. In addition to spelling and moral
lessons, it contained the U.S. Constitution, Declaration of In-
dependence, and Washington’s Farewell Address.

Fiske’s book was followed by several different spellers written
by A. Picket. The Union S pelling—Bo0k printed in New York in
1805 was already the third edition. The ﬁrst 112 pages contained
nearly 3,000 spelling words and reading lessons. The remaining
454: pages contained numbers, punctuation rules, abbreviations,
and more than 800 words with their meanings. A second one was
The Juvenile Spelling—B0ok. This one in turn was followed by a
much larger and more advanced book entitled, The Juvenile
Expositor, or Sequel to the Common Spelling—Bo.ok. The ﬁrst
198 pages were a composite of words, reading, and dictionary of
word meanings. The next 157 pages constituted an abridgment
of Murray’s English Grammar. All of these books appeared in
several editions. The pronunciation rules followed those of
Walker’s Dictionary. Incidentally, later in life Fiske went west
and helped found The Western Literary Institute and College of
Professional Teachers in Cincinnati. This organization did much
to advance and improve education in the Ohio Valley.

In 1809 The United States Spelling—B0ok was published in
Pittsburgh. Its authorship was by “Sundry Experienced Teach-
ers.” It has been said that this was the ﬁrst textbook to be both

written and printed west of the Allegheny Mountains. Its con-
tents apparently constituted the total elementary school curricu-
lum for the children of the West, for it included spelling words,
reading, lists of words with their meaning, lists of geographical
places with an explanation of their locations, lists of proper and
Bible names, arithmetic numbers and ﬁgures, grammar, and a
chronological table of important historical events. This speller
went through many reprintings. The 1821 book was the Nine-
teenthiEdition. The title page states that it follows “the rules
established by John Walker, in his critical and pronouncing
Dictionary.” As one examines many of the early spellers it be-
comes evident that there was keen and even bitter rivalry be-
tween those authors who followed the rules of Walker versus
those of Webster.

In 1812 An Introduction to Spelling and Reading by Abner
Alden was published. This book was similar to many others,
although a little larger, and provided the different kinds of
exercises for the “learning of the English language.” It followed
the dictionaries of Walker and Sheridan. The 1819 printing was
the Eighth Edition.

An Imp-roreed Spelling Book; or Y outh’s Literary Guide by
Joshua Bradley was published in Windsor, Vermont, in 1815.
This book was different from many others in several respects.
First, Bradley frankly acknowledged that the “extracts have been
taken from Webster, VVood, Picket, Alden, Bingham, Flint,
Murray, Hubbard, Fordyce, Walker, the American Gentleman’s
Pronouncing Dictionary, Dr. Johnson, Dr. Morse, and Dr.
Blair.” It should be noted that not all of the mentioned persons
were authors of spellers. A second different feature was that all
of the content, other than the spelling words, was presented in
catechetical form. Pages 65 to 180 inclusive dealt with many
matters, as grammar, punctuation, and “A Short System of
Polite Learning,” which dealt largely with matters of geography
and rhetorical writing. All these matters were treated in question-
and—ansWer form.

For example: Tut0r—-—How many kinds of seeds are there?

SPELLERS 21

Pupil——About twenty thousand.

Tutor—Is our language copious?
Pupil—-—Few languages are more copious than ours.

CHANGES IN SPELLERS

Until just before 1820 nearly all the so—called spellers were
more or less similar, in that they were virtually correlated English
books. Nearly always the greater part of the book would be a
mixture of spelling with reading lessons. Then most of them
would include in the latter part of the book matters of grammar,
punctuation, and rhetoric. In addition, often numbers, geo-
graphical terms, and even historical events would be added in the
end of the books. 8

Then rather suddenly a change took place, and spellers be-
came more fully only spelling books. This no doubt was true be-
cause separate textbooks appeared in reading, geography, and
grammar. In other words, the so—called speller no longer con-
stituted the major part of the common school curriculum. A few
of the old kind continued to appear.

One of the first to be virtually only a speller was The Pro-
nonncing Spelling Book by J. A. Cummins in 1819. About 85
per cent of the pages were spelling. Too, pictures accompanied
the few reading lessons it contained. The pronunciation of the
words was directed by diacritical marks and other symbols. For

f E k
example: hi—é-r6-glyph—i—cal. The pronunciations were based on
Walker’s Dictionary. Nearly all early spellers ended with long
and uncommon words, which likely would never be used by the
children after they left school. Words were not selected on the
basis of children’s needs.

The very next year (1820) the N ew American Spelling Book
by Stephen Byerly appeared. It was a revision of the Pennsyl-
vania Spelling Book, which had appeared in 1815 and was
written by an “Association of Teachers.” Apparently Byerly had
assisted in writing the earlier book. To overcome the localism of
the title of the earlier book, Byerly substituted the word Ameri-

can, and embellished the title page with a symbol of the American
Eagle. This was solely a speller with only a few partial pages of
reading. p

In 1823 The Critical Plrornouncing S pelling-Book by Hezekiah
Burhans was published. It was more solely a speller than any that
had yet appeared. The keys to the pronunciation of the Words
were similar, but simpler, than in Cummins’ text.

C0bb’s Spellers. Although many of the spellers heretofore men-
tioned appeared in more than one printing, yet none gave
Webster’s books serious competition until Lyman Cobb’s S pellers

SPELLERS %

were published. The Nietz Collection contains twenty different
printings or editions of Cobb’s Spellers. Lyman Cobb (1800-
1864s) was born and reared in Massachusetts, but most of his
educational career was spent in New York State.  

His first Speller was published about 1821, and it had many
faults. In 1825 Cobb’s Spelling Book appeared as a revised edi-
tion. This edition went through many reprintings. In The,Preface
of the 1825 edition he daringly analyzes the faults of Webster’s
American Speller. The two basic criticisms were that Webster
had departed too much from Walker’s “principles of Orthog-
raphy and Orthoepy, which are universally acknowledged to be
superiour to any other extant”; and that many matters in
Webste1"s S peller were inconsistent with those in his Dictionary.

The book began by presenting twelve pages of the “Rudiments
of the English Language” in catechetical form. These dealt
mainly with letter sounds, of vowels and consonants, diphthongs,
combinations, and syllables. Then the remainder of the book, with
the exception of a few pages, dealt solely with spelling and matters
of pronunciation together with just a few reading lessons mixed
in. It contained no pictures. In this regard Cobb stated in his
Preface that “it appears to be evident that they are of no ad-
vantage.” In regard to the paucity of reading lessons, he re-
marked that “The Author is highly pleased that our schools are
furnished with reading books adapted to the capacities of scholars
of every age.”

The last 40 pages presented words under rather specialized
classiﬁcation according to spelling, pronunciation, or meaning.
Page 19 to page 128 presented lists of words by chapters accord-
ing to their sound and number of syllables. A casual examination
of the longest words indicate that they were not as uncommon or as
diﬂicult as those in many other spellers of that period. Chapter
LVIII presented ten pages of words of the same pronunciation,
but of different spelling and definition. For example: “Ail, to
pain, to trouble, Ale, a kind of beer.” Chapter LIX presented
the written and phonetic spelling of words. For example: ewe
and you, does and duz. Chapter LX presented words with proper
and vulgar pronunciations, such as boil and bile, point and pinte.
In the Appendix are many words that were spelled variantly in

24 OLD TEXTBOOKS

Walker’s Dictionaries as printed in different American cities, and
words that were spelled variantly in Webster’s S peller and his
Dictionary.

In 1833 Cobb’s Expositor, or Sequel to the Spelling Book,
“containing about 1200 of the most common words of the
language” was published. It virtually was a small dictionary of
216 pages.

In 1842 Cobb’s N ew Spelling Book appeared. It was a
thorough revision of his 1825 Spelling Book. In the Preface he
stated that the “objects of a Spelling Book should be to aid the
pupil in learning to spell, pronounce, and read with ease, ac-
curacy, and precision.” In regard to the selection of the words he
stated that the Speller should “contain most of the common
and useful words of the language, properly classed, divided,
pronounced, and accepted.” Here he recognizes a modern guiding
principle in the selection of words for a speller. However, no
statement was made as to how he determined which words were
common and useful. He divided this book into six parts, as
follows: Part I, easy words; Part II, various and peculiar sounds
of single vowels and diphthongs; Part III, various and peculiar
sounds of consonants; Part IV, verbal distinctions; Part V, lists of
proper names; and Part VI, rudiments of the language in
catechetical form. Too, Cobb apparently changed his mind re-
garding the use of pictures, for this book contained over thirty
pictures. It retained considerable popularity until after 1850.

Less popular spellers. In 1828 B. D. Emerson’s The National
Spelling Book and Prononncing Tutor was published. Like most
spellers up to that time, except Webster’s, its rules of orthog-
raphy and pronounciation were based on Walker’s principles.
It eventually appeared in several editions.

The next speller to give Webster and Cobb considerable com-
petition was written by Edward Hazen, entitled, The S peller and
Deﬁner; or Class Book, N o. 2 in 1829. It was “designed to answer
the purposes of a spelling ‘book, and to supersede the necessity of
the use of a dictionary as a class-book.” Hazen further stated
that it was published “with the avowed object of banishing the
Spelling—Book from the schools and the Dictionary also, so far

as the latter was used as a class—book to be committed to memory.”
He apparently was critical of too much stress on memoriter learn-
ing. He also wrote the S3/mbolical Primer. Editions of his S peller
appeared as late as 1856.

In 1830 Samuel Worcester, author of an early graded series
of readers, published A Second Book for Reading and Spelling,
and A Third Book for Reading and Spelling. In these two
books he attempted speciﬁcally to correlate reading and
spelling. While this had actually been done in many earlier
spellers, yet it had not been so deﬁnitely done before. In 1831 he
published a Sequel to The Spelling Book. This really was a small
dictionary, except the Words did not appear in a single alpha-
betical list. Rather they appeared alphabetically under certain
headings, as Nouns dealing with animal life, or Verbs, etc.

26 OLD TEXTBOOKS

A number of other spellers were published in the 1820’s and
early 1830’s, which apparently failed to receive wide acceptance.
Among them were Israel Alger’s revision of Perry’s Speller
(1825) ; Elihu Marshall’s A Spelling Book of the English Lan-
guage (1831), which even contained a set of rules for tem-
perance; Peter Parley’s (S. G. Goodrich) Spelling Book (1834),
which contained many pictures; L. W. Leonard’s The North
American Spelling Book (1835) ; Samuel Gummere’s The
Scholar’s Progressive and Etgmological Spelling Book (1836) ;
Bentley’s The Pictorial Spelling Book (1839) ; Bumstead’s
Spelling and Thinking Combined (1841) ; Fowle’s The Common
School Speller (1842) ; William Russell’s Spelling Book (1844) ;
Tower’s The Gradual S peller and Complete Enunciator (1845) ;
James McElligott’s The Young Analyzer, Spelling Book, and
Dictionary (1845) ; William Swan’s The Spelling Book (1848) ;
and Ticknor’s Columbian Spelling Book (1849).

It may be interesting to note that some of the above titles
describe the nature and claims of the books. Apparently authors
were trying to gain attention and adoptions for their books by
doing things differently from other authors. However, getting
textbook adoptions is different than attracting readers through
unusual titled articles in periodicals or newspapers.

Two other spellers will be mentioned here before going to
other later and more popular books. These two were published
by religious agencies. The first one was The Sunday-School
Spelling-Book published by the Episcopal Sunday and Adult-
School Society of Philadelphia in 1822. The title page further
stated that it was “Compiled with a view as well to teach Children
to Spell and Read, as to Contribute to Their Moral and Reli-
gious Instruction.” It was similar to other much earlier spellers
with a religious catechism added.

The other one was The Union Spelling Book published by the
American Sunday-School Union in 1838, which was an improved
edition of the earlier Union Speller (1827 P). These spellers were
exceptions to the tendency for spellers to be rather solely spelling
books afterthe appearance of Cummins’ book in 1819. Rather
they were like the earlier books containing the various basic
elements of learning. The reason for the nature of their content,

SPELLERS 27

however, is quite clear. They Were for use in Sunday schools,
which would meet only once per week instead of daily. These
early Sunday schools were usually non-sectarian or inter—denomi—
national, and would meet nearly all day on Sunday. Too, they
were most numerous in the states not yet having public schools.
In fact, when the American Sunday School Union was formed
in 1824 public schools existed only in NeW,England and in New
York State. Thus the Sunday schools aimed to provide the
elements of a basic education, particularly for the poor, on Sun-
day. This S peller even included several songs with the musical
notes, and a map of the Western World.

OTHER SPELLERS BEFORE 1850

One of the most prolific spelling book authors was Salem Town

(1779-1864:) . He said that when principal of Granville Academy

from 1807 till 1822 he observed that the scholars had difficulty
“in tracing Latin and Greek derivatives to the radical words.”
So he began collecting and deﬁning “prefixes and suﬂiwes, as the
modiﬁers of the signiﬁcant import of radical words.” This work
resulted in Town’s Analysis of Words in 1835. This book gained
wide usage. The next year his Spelling and Deﬁning Book;
Being an Introduction to Town’s Analysis appeared. The 1840
printing of this book was the Eighty—Third Edition. This S peller
was a rather conventional speller with some attention given to
analysis of the more common preﬁxes and suffixes. These two
books were followed by his Speller and Deﬁner in 18457 ; the
Progressive S peller by Town and Holbrook in 1859; and Town’s
New S peller and Definer in 1868, which continued in print as
late as 1890.

SPELLERS 29

Two other spellers, later to attain considerable popularity,
were published in 1888. One was The Eclectic Progressive Spell-
ing Book by A. H. McGuffey, brother of the famous William
McGruffey, the original author of the famous Readers. Except for
a few pages it was completely a speller. Instead of following the
pronunciation principles of Walker, which were followed, by most
authors of spellers up to that time, McGuffey followed those of
Webster, as most later authors did.

McGuffey’s Speller contained only a few pictures and a few
very brief reading lessons, but its peculiar feature was the

system used for the pronunciation of the vowels in words with
aid of Arabic numerals. The “Table of Vowel Sounds” stated

8 1 2 3 44
that “A” has four sounds, as follows: fate, far, fall, and fat;
1 2 1 2
“E” two sounds, as me, met; “I” two sounds, as pine, pin; “O”

1 2 3

four sounds, as no, move, not, good; and “U” three sounds, as

1 2 3
tube, tub, full. Then in the body of the book the words were

presented in lists of similar vowel sounds and number of syllables.
For example:
4 2 4: 2
nav i ga ble
prac ti ca ble
hab it a ble
lap id a ry
ac cu ra cy

Otherwise this Speller was similar to contemporary spellers.

In 1846 it was slightly revised by lengthening some of the
reading selections with accompanying pictures, and introducing
“as many primitive words as the space would allow, and then,
in subsequent lessons, illustrating by examples and rules the
formation of the more important derivatives.” It was copyrighted
again in 1865 with only a few minor changes.

In 187 9 a major revision of the McGuffey Speller was made
by W. B. Watkins, D.D., whom the publishers employed. The

numeral system indicating vowel sounds was dropped in favor

of the use of diacritical marks. The number of reading selections
Was decreased, and many more difficult words introduced, partic-
ularly some derived from foreign languages. One needs to raise
the question why the children should be expected to learn to
spell so many rare words when they would never or rarely use
them in later life. For example such words as: ché vauii de fr'1'sé
(she V6’ de fréz’) (p. 135). This edition continued to be repub-
lished even after 1900. The covers of all the M.cGuﬁ°ey Spellers
were colored in different shades of brown, in contrast to the many
other spellers that were blue in imitation of Webster’s.

Charles Sanders’ Spelling Book was the third speller to be
published in 1838. It soon provided both Webster and McGuHey

SPELLERS 31

considerable competition. It, like the McGuffey S peller, followed
the principles of VVebster rather than Johnson or Walker. It,
too, used Arabic numerals above the vowels to indicate their
sounds. The book began with ten pages of questions and answers
concerning the rules and principles of orthography. Then the
remainder of the book was nearly entirely a speller. Even though
in The Preface he stated, “A Spelling Book should not only
comprise a system of instruction, embracing the subjects of
orthography and pronunciation, but should also teach the sig-
niﬁcation and use of words,” actually less attention was given
to the meaning of words, except just a few pages at the end,
than was true of many other earlier spellers. This edition went
through several reprintings.

In 1854 Sanders’ New S peller, Deﬁner and Analyzer appeared

as a revised edition. He claimed:

It employs almost every possible expedient for the development
of their meanings also: comparing and contrasting them one with

McGuffey’s Eclectic Spelling B0olc——few words for daily use.

32 OLD TEXTBOOKS

another, unfolding their signiﬁcations by formal deﬁnitions, and
everywhere rendering prominent those distinctions which are likely
to escape the notice of youth.

An examination of this book reveals that his claims were much
more fully fulﬁlled than in his earlier edition. Diacritical marks
were used as guides to pronunciation.

This book was followed by Sanders’ The Primary Spelling
Book in 1858. Here he tries to do for spelling what has already
been done in other Subject fields by grading the books. This
book used much larger type, including many pictures, and listed
simpler and fewer words. He suggested that it be used as an
introduction to the 1854 edition. It, too, presents the meanings
of many words, particularly of words “alike, or nearly alike, in
sound, but unlike in meaning.” For example, ale and ail, air
and heir, and so on.

In 1886 Sanders’ Test—Speller appeared. In The Preface he
states that it will be “suitable for the higher classes in Schools
and Teachers’ Institutes.” It contains about 5,000 words, includ-
ing “all those about which people are most apt to differ, or to
be at a loss.” For example, it contains numerous lists of words
as strange as the following:

ap' pan age —— — — lands for the younger son of a prince
ba liz' —— —— —— a sea-mark

sych no car’ pous — — — bearing frequent crops

pa ron' y mous — — — of like sound

When one sees many of these unusually unfamiliar words, one
may wonder why an author should expect anyone ever to learn
to spell them. In fact this can be said about many words in most
of the old spellers.

A N ew Spelling Book compiled by John Comly was published
in 1842. This was a revision and enlargement of a previous
smaller, and not too popular, speller by the same author. It
went through several reprintings for more than a decade. The
first 110 pages were spelling with a few brief reading selections.
Then there were 63 pages of words with their meanings. Lastly,
it contained several pages -of arithmetical tables.

SPELLERS 33

Also in 1842 Albert D. Wright’s Elements of The English
Language; or, Analytical Orthography was published. While
this was not a regular speller, it dealt with the rules of pronun-
ciation and derivation of words, as well as their meaning. So in
a sense, it was a supplementary speller. It continued to be re-
printed until the 18’70’s.

Another author whose speller first appeared in the 1840’s was
R. M’ K. Ormsby. It was The American Deﬁnition Spelling
Book of 1844. It was similar to a number of other spellers during
that period, being really a combination of speller and dictionary.
However, the words were arranged in lists phonetically rather
than alphabetically. In 1857 Ormsby’s Vermont Speller; or
Progressive Lessons in The English Language appeared. It Was
a little smaller than his earlier book, and Went through several
reprintings.

The last author before 1850 to be mentioned here is James
Lynd, althoughhe did not write a regular speller. In 1847 he
published The First Book of Etymology. It continued to be re-
printed as late as the 18'70,’s. It was similar to, but larger than,
Town’s Analysis of Words (1835). Both writers presented the
words in lists according to their prefixes or suffixes, together
with their deﬁnitions. Apparently, considerable attention was
given to the composition of words during that period of American
educational history. Although only a few books arranged all the
words in this manner, yet many other regular spellers had similar
but fewer lists of words thus arranged usually near the end of

the book.

SPELLERS, 1850-1 900

The spellers of no author written after 1850 attained the
popularity or continued to be republished over as long a span
of time as was true of the spellers written by Webster, Mc-
Guffey, Sanders, and Cobb. In fact, the spellers of Webster and
McGuffey continued to have considerable popularity throughout
the second half of the nineteenth century. Possibly one reason
why their circulation continued was because the later editions
were published by strong book publishing houses, which could
promote their sale, rather than merely being printed by local
printers in different cities as was the common practice earlier.
Improved mail and transportation facilities made it possible for
the printing and publishing practices of textbooks to be changed.

As was true before 1850, many different spellers were pub-
lished between 1850 and 1900. The writer’s collection contains
spellers written by nearly seventy—ﬁve different authors during
this period. Most of these were published only in one or two
editions. A considerable number of them appeared in three or
more editions. Only a few attained wide acceptance. The purpose
now is to describe brieﬂy the more popular ones, and then merely
mention those which appeared only in several editions or print-
ings.

One of the first authors after 1850, whose books gained con-
siderable circulation, at least regionally, was Lucius Osgood. His

SPELLERS 35

Progressive Speller was first published in Pittsburgh in 1856.
Later editions were also published in Philadelphia and New York.
He claimed to have arranged the lessons simply, but systemati-
cally. He classified the words “with reference to the vowel sounds
in the accented syllable and the initial letter.” The sounds of the
vowels were indicated by numerals, similar to the system previ-
ously used by McGuffey. The latter part of the book contained
a mixture of different kinds of lessons, as dictation exercises,
abbreviations, Latin phrases, French and Italian words, proper
names, and derivatives.

In 1873 Osgood published two new spellers in graded form;
namely, the American Primary Speller, and the American
Advanced S peller. Both of these were considerably diﬁ"erent from
his earlier S peller. Although graded textbooks had already ap-
peared in other ﬁelds, they had not yet become common in
spellers. The Primary S peller had several interesting features.
The type was larger than in most spellers, the lessons were
shorter, many more pictures were included, the words were much
more elementary, and the vowel sounds were indicated by dia-
critical marks rather than by numerals. The Advanced S peller,
as its title would indicate, contained more difficult words, longer
lessons, and fewer pictures. Numerals were used to indicate vowel
sounds. The latter part of the book contained many miscellaneous
types of lessons similar to those used in Osgood’s Progressive
S peller, but more difficult. Both were published in Pittsburgh
and New York.

Another one first published in 1856 was Epes Sargent’s The
Standard Speller. One unique feature of this book was the
manner in listing the words. Other spellers arranged them in
columns; Sargent presented them in rows or lines. For example,
a line of page 72 is as follows: a—e’ ri—al, al—lu’ vi—al, co1—lo’ qui-al,
di-lu' vi—al. It appeared in a number of editions. In 1873 his
A School M annal of English Etymology was published. It was
very similar to other books of like title. I

In 1857 J. E. Worcester published the Prononncing S pelling~
Book. In the Preface the author admits that there were already
many spelling books “of different degrees of excellence,” but
justiﬁed the publication of this one as particularly suitable to

36 OLD TEXTBOOKS

be used in connection with the Worcester Dictionaries, which
were giving Webster’s Dictionaries stiff competition. He used
a very detailed system of diacritical marks to indicate pronun-
ciations. This Speller was republished many times for twenty
years. .

Also in 1857 The National Pronoimcing Speller by R. G.
Parker and J. M. Watson was published. This was the ﬁrst one
of three written by them. These spellers had wide circulation
for more than thirty years. The title of the ﬁrst one, as was true
of many spellers written during this period, indicated that the
emphasis was not merely on learning to spell the words, but also
on correct oral enunciation and pronunciation. It should be kept
in mind that readers written during this period also emphasized
oral reading or elocution. Interestingly, this book combined
characteristics in regard to which there were differing practices;
namely, the procedure in presenting the words, and the method
of indicating the sounds of letters. In the ﬁrst part of the book
the words are arranged in columns, as had been the common
practice. Then in about two-thirds of the book the words are
presented in rows or lines, as was done by Worcester in his book
published the same year. Then in regard to the letter sounds, the
vowel sounds were indicated by numerals, as had been done by
McGuffey, but diacritical marks were used for consonants. For

2 . 1

example, sta tis tic’al, le git’ i ma cy, ad Vis’ a ble. Like many
other spellers the end of the book contained a number of miscel-
laneous lessons.

In 1859 the same authors published the National Elementary
Speller. This they said was to accompany their National Series
of Readers. In about two-thirds of the book the words were ar-
ranged in columns and one-third in lines. Otherwise it was similar
to their earlier one, except that it was smaller and more elemen-
tary.

These two books were followed in 187 5 by the Complete Speller
Written by Watson alone, which was very different than the
others. In the Preface he stated:

The Exercises must be both ORAL and WRITTEN, the lessons

SPELLERS 37

and Methods strictly educational, and in conformity with the Laws
of Mental Association.

Diacritical marks were used to indicate the sounds of both vowels
and consonants. Then a new feature was introduced. Part Second
is entitled “Popular Words,” which part constitutes one—half of
the book. The words related to topics “embrace Man, and the
Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral Kingdoms.” Here an attempt
is made to relate the words to the world and the aspects of life.
Apparently these features helped to popularize the book, for it
went through frequent and numerous editions.

Following 1857 many new spellers appeared in rather rapid
succession, but none really became popular until Swinton’s was
first published in 1871. The writer’s collection contains spellers
by sixteen different authors appearing between 1857 and 1871.
However, a few of these did go through several editions. In 1858
Wm. W. Smith’s The S peller’s Manual was published. This was

a small book containing a “collection of words usually mis-

spelled.” All the words appeared alphabetically together with
their deﬁnitions and roots.

In 1863 Marcius Willson published his Primary Speller, and
in 1864.4 the Larger Speller. Thus like Osgood, he graded his
spellers. The latter went through several editions, one as late as
1892. These Spellers contained no unusual features. He used
diacritical marks to indicate sounds.

In 1865 Albert N. Raub published The Normal S peller, which
was about two-thirds a speller and one—third an orthography. It
contained 10,000 words. Raub used numerals to show the sounds
of vowels and diacritical marks for consonants. He particularly
emphasized the rules of spelling. The next year he published
The Normal Primary Speller to precede the other. Like other
primary spellers, it contained many pictures, larger type, and
simpler word lists. Then in 1881 his Tests in Spelling and Pro-
nunciation appeared. It really was a small dictionary of what
he considered to be the more important words for spelling, but
today many of these would be thought to be unimportant.

Beginning in 1867 A. C. Webb began publishing a Model
Word—Book Series, composed of The Model Etymology, The

38 OLD TEXTBOOKS
Model Deﬁner, and A M ctnnal of Etymology. These appeared

in various editions even as late as the 1880’s.

In the late 1860’s Wm. R. Creery, superintendent of schools
of Baltimore, published The Primary School Spelling Book,
which in 1869 was followed by a more advanced one entitled, The
Grammar-School S pelling—Book. Part IV of the latter was
entirely Etymology.

In 1869 N. P. Henderson published two books that were
identical, but with different titles; namely, Test Words in S pell-
ing, and Test Words in English Orthographg. Both seem to
have been Widely used until the late 1880’s, even Without revision.
They contained about 2,000 words with deﬁnitions, plus sixteen
pages in ﬁne print of modern geographical names diacritically
marked. Most other similar books arranged the defined Words
alphabetically, but Henderson mixed their arrangement. For ex-
ample, the very first word was vi—cis’ si—-tude. Apparently he be-
lieved the alphabetical listing would be too similar to a dictionary.

The writer Whose spellers Went through more editions than
any written after 1850 was William Swinton. The Writer’s col-
lection has seventeen, all of different date or title. Swinton
(1833-92) was really a journalist by profession. During the
Civil War, as a reporter for the New York Times, he was so
critical in reporting from the fronts about the conduct of some
of the battles that eventually the government deprived him of
the privileges of a War correspondent. Later he wrote some out-
standing war histories. This Work led to an appointment as a
professor of English at the University of California. There he
proved insubordinate to the president. He returned to the East
to devote full time to textbook writing. Soon he wrote textbooks
in the ﬁelds of spelling, American history, World history, gram-
mar, composition, and geography.

The first (1871), entitled Word Analysis, was “a graded class-
book of English derivative words, with practical exercises in
spelling, analyzing, deﬁning, synonyms, and the use of Words.” It
really was a combination text in etymology and spelling. It soon
appeared in many editions.

The next year (1872) the Word Book of English Spelling,
Oral and Written appeared. The writer has nine of different

SPELLERST 39

dates. The emphasis on written as well as oral spelling was then
rather new. The book was designed to precede the Word Analysis.
Some of the points of superiority claimed by the author were
short lessons, a careful division of lessons into written and oral
spelling, division of lessons into monthly and yearly sections,
systematic review lessons, short lessons of the names of . common
objects and activities of life, and uses of the principle of associ-
ation of ideas by classifying words with reference to leading ideas.

In 1873 Swinton published the Word Primer, which was a
beginner’s book in oral and written spelling. It was intended
for use after a child had gone through some reading primer. It
was characterized by very short lessons, the grouping of words
according to leading ideas, selection of common words that can
be understood by young children, and the division of the book
intospeciﬁc “Monthly and Yearly Sections.” The last feature
was very new in the speciﬁc grading of teaching material.

Finally, in 1879 Swinton published a major revision ofihis
ﬁrst book, entitling it the N ew Word—Analysis. He retained the

old approach, but added considerable new matter. Much emphasis -

was on the structure of words and their derivations, particularly
those from the Latin and Greek. Part V dealt with “Miscellaneous
Derivatives.” The divisions of this section then dealt with “Woirds
Derived from The Names of Persons”; “Words Derived from
The Names of Places”; and “Etymology of Words Used in The
Principal School Studies,” listing terms in the ﬁelds of geogra-
phy, grammar, and arithmetic. Truly Swinton was a terriﬁcally
proliﬁc textbook writer. 

Calvin Patterson’s Common School Speller was publishediin
187 4. He claimed that it contained “only those words in general
use and which every pupil should know how to spell.” Then he
said that the pupil “must not only be able to spell orally, but
to write the English language without mistakes.” The book was
divided into seven parts according to the type of words presented.
Thirteen tables of arithmetic were presented on the inside of the
covers. This book appeared in a number of editions.

In 1875 Patterson published the Speller and Analyzer. It
virtually was a combination of speller, etymology, and dictionary.

Then as late as 1897 he published The American Word Book. It

4O OLD TEXTBOOKS

contained graded lessons in spelling, deﬁning, punctuation, and
dictation. The word lists were commonly interspersed with quota-
tions from famous writers.

In 1877 Josiah Gilbert published A Graded Spelling—Book.
In 1884: the same author published School Studies in Words,
which went through several editions. He aimed “to combine in
one manual some simple exercises in spelling and language.” He
particularly stressed dictation exercises and work in sentence
building. , p

H. F. Harrington wrote A Graded Spelling-Book in 1880 in
two parts. The two parts meant that it was suitable both for
primary and grammar schools. He said that a speller “must be
illustrative of the natural laws of intellectual progress.” These
words should not appear according to the number of syllables,
but in the order in which they would help the child advance in
knowledge. Since the usefulness of being able to spell is limited
largely to the connection with what one writes, so it is the eye
rather than the ear that needs most training. This book con-
tinued publication until the late 1890’s. Interestingly, nineteen
tables of arithmetic appeared printed on the inside of the covers.

The Modern S pelling—Book by J. N. Hunt and H. I. Gourley
appeared in 1883. Peculiarly, the six copies in the writer’s col-
lection were published by ﬁve different publishing houses, four
printed in 1883 and two in 189.6. This cooperative arrangement

among these companies, no doubt, increased its circulation. The

authors refer to a developing opposition to the use of separate
spelling books in school. So they claim to have carefully selected
the words from modern readers. Thus a correlation of spellers
and readers was attempted. Special features included drills in
grammatical forms of words, topical lessons on different sub ects,
word building and word analysis exercises, and the origin of
words. Then in 1904 Hunt alone published The Progressive
Course in Spelling in Two Parts. Each part was to be for three
years or three grades. These parts could be purchased either as
separate books or as one complete book.

Word Lessons: A Complete Speller by Alonzo Reed was pub-

SPELLERS 41

lished in 1884: and reprinted in 1894.4 and 1897. He, like Hunt
and Gourley, also referred to the growing opposition to the
speciﬁc use of spellers. He then mentioned that the unusual words

of the “old—time speller,” and the common words rarely mis-

spelled should be dropped from spellers. The book was designed
to teach correct spelling and pronunciation of the words most
commonly current in literature, and as most likely to be mis-
spelled. Too, it hoped to awaken new interest in the study of
synonyms and word analysis. It was to serve the higher primary,
intermediate, and grammar grades. Much script type appeared
throughout the book, so that the child could see how words look
in written form.

The spelling books heretofore discussed went through three
or more editions or printings. The following spellers published
between 1850 and 1900 apparently proved less popular, but did
appear in at least two editions: Daniel Leach’s The Complete
Speller in 1856; J. W. VVestlake’s Three Thousand Practice
Words in 1874; Lewis Monroe’s The Practical S peller in 1875;
Richard French’s Study of Words in 1877; E. A. Sheldon’s The
Graded Speller in 1877 (Also his Word Studies in 1886);
Seventy Lessons in Spelling by Williams and Rodgers in 1885;
Seventy Lessons in Spelling by A. S. Osborn and J. E. King in
1885; and Martin G. Benedict’s The Advanced S peller in 1898.

The last book to be discussed was The Rational S peller, Part I
(ﬁrst three grades), and Part II (next three grades) written
by J. M. Rice in 1898. In the late 1890’s Rice conducted a
careful study involving nearly all of the large cities of the
country regarding the actual spelling proﬁciency of more than
33,000 pupils. Then the results were analyzed and summarized
in an article entitled “The Futility of The Spelling Grind,”
which appeared in The Forum for April and June, 1897. These
articles have been credited as having given an impetus to the
measurement movement in the U.S.

The characteristic features Rice claimed for his Speller were
“careful grading of the work in accordance with the natural
growth of the child’s comprehension,” the precedence given to
common words, the small number of words in relation to the
ground covered, and ample provision made for thorough drill

42 OLD TEXTBOOKS

by means of frequent reviews between the children and the teacher.

It should be noted that only spellers ﬁrst published before
1900 have been dealt with in this chapter. The spellers in the
writer’s collection were written by more than one hundred and
twenty ﬁve different authors, but only one-third of them have
been discussed here. The books by two—thirds of the authors
failed to get wide usage.

SUMMARY

The earliest spellers commonly used in America were written
in England. Then they were either brought here by the colonist
or reprinted and sold here. Most of the earliest spellers written
in America, except Webster’s, were modeled after the English.
Most of the authors, except Webster, until the late 1830’s, used
English dictionaries, such as Walker and Johnson, for their
bases of syllabication and pronunciation. Thus the English in-
ﬂuence on our learning and culture continued long after our
political independence.

The ﬁrst author of spellers to depart from the strong English
inﬂuence was Noah Webster. Being an ardent American patriot,
he believed that our independence should become more or less
total. So in his spellers he set up rules and principles for the
syllabication and pronunciation according to the ways in which
Americans were actually pronouncing words. His spellers re-
mained popular for a century. The ﬁrst important spellers to
follow the principles of Webster rather than Walker were the
McGuffey and Sanders S pellers. p

Another important characteristic of the earliest spellers was
that they contained not only spelling, but also reading lessons,
grammar, and often arithmetic and geography. In other words,
their content constituted the entire primary school curriculum. It
Was not until approximately 1825 that spellers began to appear
which were largely only spellers. By 1820 separate textbooks in
the ﬁelds of reading, grammar, geography, and arithmetic
appeared.

From the beginning spellers would commonly include a list
of words defined, usually near the back of the book. Soon, too,

SPELLERS 43

they would include lists showing the roots and derivativesiof
words. Later these two features would often be combined. In
fact, for about ﬁfty years, during the middle of the nineteenth
century, many textbooks even bore the title of Etymology. These
books commonly would be a combination of speller and dictionary.

It was not until the late 1850’s that spellers appeared in
graded series, and then only in two books, the primary book for
the lower grades and the advanced for the uppergrades. Text-
books in several other ﬁelds had commonly appeared in series
beginning in the 1830’s. '

.The evolution of the methods of presentation need to be noted.
The earliest spellers usually indicated the pronunciation of words
by the use of diacritical marks and syllabication. McGuffey, and
a number of others, for several decades, used Arabic numerals
above the vowels to signify the sound. Later some used numerals
to signify the sounds of the vowels, but diacritical marks for
consonants, such as the sound of the “c” or “g.” After the 1870’s
most spellers used diacritical marks only. i ’

Most early spellers apparently expected all spelling teaching
to be oral only with great emphasis on pronunciation. Begin-
ning in the early 1870’s a number of spellers suggested that the
teaching be both oral and written. One writer suggested that
since most use for spelling is in writing, the eye rather than the
ear should be more fully trained.

In regard to the words, their selection and arrangement were
usually logical rather than psychological. With only a few excep-
tions, none of the early authors mentioned that the words of
most common use only were selected. Cobb in 1825 did mention
it. After 1875 frequent claims were made regarding the selection
of the most useful words, and also that they were presented ac-

cording to their difficulty in learning. Reed even said that words
rarely misspelled were omitted, so that emphasis could be placed
on teaching the more diﬂicult ones. It is evident that American
spelling textbooks have gone through many evolutionary changes.

Although no attempt has been made to analyze spellers pub-
lished after 1900, yet a few comments about spellers since then
should be made in general. After J. M. Rice’s study of spelling
practices, other studies soon followed, particularly to determine

44 OLD TEXTBOOKS

the most commonly used words. Such studies were made by L. P.
Ayres, W. N. Anderson, W.  Cook and  V. O’Shea, Ernest
Horn, J. D. Houser, E. J. Ashbaugh, and Edward Thorndike.
The best known study was made by Thorndike. In 1921 he
published The Teachers Word Book, which contained an alpha-
betical list of the most frequently occurring 10,000 words as deter-
mined from a count of 625,000 Words of children’s literature;
about 3,000,000 from the Bible and English Classics; $00,000
from textbooks; 50,000 more or less technical words from books
on cooking, sewing, farming, and trades; 90,000 from news-
papers; and 500,000 from correspondence. In 1932 Thorndike
published a 20,000 basic word list, and in 1944 a 30,000 basic
word list. In 1926 Horn and Ashbaugh published a S peller based
on the most frequently used words derived from a study of
5,100,000 words of ordinary writing. Since then most spelling
textbooks use only the three or four thousand most frequently
used words of these studies as the spelling words to be learned.
In fact it is claimed that if a child learns to spell the %,800
words most frequently used by adults, he will have learned about
97 per cent of the words needed in most common types of adult
writing. Truly the teaching of spelling in the American schools
has gone through many changes. a

READERS

INTRODUCTION

ONG before reading textbooks appeared the children of the
American colonies learned to read from a hornbook, a so-
called speller, or a primer. The so—called hornbook Was really
not a book, but a thin board generally shaped like a paddle on
which was pasted a printed page and covered with a thin sheet
of transparent horn for protection. Some of the hornbooks con-
tained only the alphabet, while others included some syllables,
and even the Lord’s Prayer. These were commonly used in the
dame schools from which the children would at least learn the
alphabet as a first step toward learning to read. [See Frontis—
piece] .

Mention was made in the chapter about Spellers that the early
spellers usually contained reading and grammar material in
addition to spelling. The earliest spellers used by the colonists
were brought here from England, or reprinted here. The most
popular of these was Dilworth’s New Guide to the English
Tongue. The writer’s oldest edition of Dilworth contains 146
pages. About 56 pages of this book were devoted to reading
selections, many of which were selected fables. The next most
popular speller was Perry’s Only Sure Guide to the English
Tongue. Nearly one—half of the book was devoted to reading

46 OLD TEXTBOOKS

New England Primer——prima1'y curriculum, Colonial New England, 1777.

READERS M

lessons, many of these, too, were fables—stories to teach manners.

In the oldest American printed speller, The Yoath’s I nstractor
in the English Tongue: or, the Art of Spelling Improved, pub-
lished in 1762, roughly, one—half of the pages were reading
selections, many of which were religious in nature. By far the
most popular early American spellers with readings Were those
by VVebster. The earlier editions contained considerable reading
material, but not as much as most other early spellers, possibly
because he also was the author of a reader. In general, the
early American spellers contain less reading than those brought
from England. However, there is one marked exception to
this; namely, The Union Spelling Book. Instead of the reading
lessons being mixed in with the spelling, as was most common in
other spellers, the spelling words appear in connection with the
reading selections. Thus it is more fully a reader than a speller.

The other chief source of reading material for the children of
the colonial period was the so—called primers. The earliest
primers, also, were ﬁrst produced in England. Since England
did not provide for mass education during that period, these
primers were either published by or for religious and charitable
agencies, which tried to provide some learning for the poor in
charity schools. Many such primers ‘Were published and copies
of them were brought here by some of the colonists.

Fortunately, Benjamin Harris, an English printer, who had
experience dealing with primers in England, came early to
America. Before coming here he had published in 1679 The
Protestant Tutor. Being an ardent non—conformist in religion
he had printed a number of tracts which were offensive to the
English government; consequently, he was arrested, tried, and
put in a pillory, and required to serve two years in jail. Later
he came to Boston, where in 1686 he set up a book and “Coffee,
Tee and Chucaletto” shop.
Soon thereafter he prepared
The N ere England Primer,
modelled after some of the
British primers.

No existing copy of the first edition seems to be extant. New-
man’s News of the Stars, in 1690 contained an advertisement of a
second and enlarged edition of The N ew England Primer. Since
no copyright laws were in effect, printers in nearly every Ameri-
can town began to reprint it, including, changing, adding, or
omitting what they saw fit, and then selling it locally. The title
would even be changed, such as The New York Primer, The
American Primer, or The Columbian Primer. With a change of
government in England, Harris later returned there. The N ew
England Primer certainly was the most widely used textbook in
the colonial period, and even had considerable usage after 1800.
It has been estimated that ultimately about three million copies
were sold. T

Although the editions of the various printers were not fully
alike, their similarity was quite marked. Most of them were 314
by 4% inches in size, yet some were 4: by 6 or 4:1/2 by 51/2 inches.
Many of the earlier editions contained 88 pages, but some of
the later ones were printed in finer print and contained fewer
pages and less content. After several pages containing the
alphabet, syllables such as, ab, ac, eb, ec, if, ic, ob, oc, ub,
uc, and short lists of words of one, two, three, four, ﬁve, and
six syllables, the alphabet was presented in verse with accom-
panying wood—cut pictures. To learn the letter “A” the verse
was “In Adams fall, We sinned all.” The writer has examined
more than a dozen different editions of the N ew England Primer
and found that most of them contained the alphabet in verse;
however, not in all were the verses alike. For example, for “E”
one was, “Elijah hid, By Ravens fed”; another was, “The Eagles
ﬂight, Is out of sight.” For “O” one was, “The Royal Oak it
was the Tree, That sav’d His Royal majestic”; another was,
“Young Obadias, David, Josias, All were pious.”

The remainder of the content was nearly all religious in nature,
such as questions on Bible facts, Bible verses alphabetically ar-
ranged, several prayers, The Creed, Bible names, and the Shorter
Catechism of 107 questions and answers. Some of the older
editions also contained “Spiritual Milk for American Babes” by
John Cotton. Many also included a wood cut of the burning of
“John Rogers, minister of the gospel in London, (who) was the

READERS M

ﬁrst martyr in Queen lVIary’s reign.” This certainly was a rather
morbid picture for a primer. Regardless of what one may say
concerning the shortcomings of the N ew England Primer as an
appropriate beginning reading text, yet it constituted the basic
elementary curriculum for the mass of children in colonial New
England, and to a lesser extent in some other colonies. Ap-
parently only few children, other than the boys who attended
Latin Grammar schools, remained in school long enough to study
the Psalter in addition to the N ew England Primer.

CONTENT

O A number of studies have been made dealing with development of

the content of American readers. One of the earlier studies was
made by Reeder.1 In the beginning‘ chapters he merely describes
the evolution of the horn-book, some spellers, the more popular

“ primers, and a few of the most popular advanced readers. In the

latter part he discusses the evolution of the methods and ap-
proaches of teaching reading.

Vail2 wrote a descriptive development of the McGuffey Readers.
Since Vail was a member of the publishing ﬁrm, this book deals
more with the business aspects of publishing these readers than
with an analysis of their content. Later Minnich3 dealt more
fully with the evolution of the nature of the content of these
readers.

One of the most comprehensive studies was made by Robinson.‘‘
One may question how thoroughly he could have analyzed the
content of 1,370 readers. However, he should be given credit for
attempting to classify the nature of the content under many
topics, and classifying them according-to prose and poetry. As
a base for beginning the treatment of the content in readers, his

summary table is here reproduced. An examination of the so-
called topics of this table will soon reveal that some actually
dealt with the nature of the topics concerned, While others dealt
with the form in which the content was presented. For example,
the essay, oratory, folklore, and fairy stories indicate the form
of presentation rather than the thoughts involved in the content.
Nevertheless, the data of the table certainly roughly reveal the

changes in the content of readers during two centuries.

Religion and morals. All studies of the content of readers agree
that the books during the colonial period most fully stressed
religion, and in most instances were sectarian in nature. In New
England, where the Puritans held a monopolistic control of
governmental matters, the Calvinistic religious principles were
taught even in the public schools. In the other colonies, Where
parochial schools were more common, the various religious groups
taught their respective religious principles from their -own
primers. These primers usually contained a sectarian catechism.

Following our independence from England and the adoption
of our constitution, which theoretically separated church and
state, the teaching of sectarian religion began to be questioned.

Therefore, according to Robinson’s data, the percentage of reli-
gious content dropped from 9% per cent during the colonial
period to 22 per cent during the next ﬁfty years. The religious
content that did remain in was more or less non-sectarian in
nature. Tingelstad5 found that the leading readers between 1830
and 1840 averaged 16.7 per cent religious content. However, the
famous McGruffey readers retained considerable religious content
much later than most other readers. For example, Hughesﬁ found
that nearly 30 per cent of the lessons in the Fourth Reader
(1837 and 1844) were religious. The Fifth and Sixth Readers
contained less, but considerably more than other readers, partic-
ularly in the poetic selections. All the studies show that little
religious content remained in the readers after 1850.

Warren’s7 study dealt with
the nature of the religious
content in detail. He found
that the concepts dealt mainly
with God, man in his religious
relations, Christ, immortality,
and the Bible. Such attributes
of God, as good, invisible,
omniscient, and wise, were
mentioned. God was fre—-
quently referred to as the
Creator of nature, the uni-
verse, and of man, especially
mentioned between 1830 and
1860. Grod’s providential rela-

tions to his creatures were expressed in lessons dealing with afflic-
tions, discouragements, human experiences, historical events, and
nature. In the McGuffey Readers appear references that “The
heavens declare the glory of God,” “The hand that made us is
divine,” and “VVe should praise our Creator as the sky lark does;
but also that God’s judgment is seen in the thunder cloud, war,
and plagues.” Disappointments are even pictured as blessings in
disguise.

In dealing with the nature and duties of man, readers are re-
ferred to repentance, sin, and punishment. Mistreatment of birds
and animals, blasphemy, bad companions, hypocrisy, intemperance,
lying, and stealing, were to be avoided. Then even more fre-
quently lessons appear exalting the positive virtues of man, such
as caring for animals and birds, performing acts of charity,

cheerfulness, contentment, courage, diligence, forgiveness, love of
neighbors, peace loving, tolerance, bearing social responsibility,
and practicing the Golden Rule.

A surprising number of references that relate directly or in-
directly to immortality continued to appear in readers, particu-
larly until about 1860. Lessons contained such concepts as the
endless life, only goodness there (in heaven), reunion, the soul’s
immortality, virtues rewarded, supreme society, and treasures
laid up.

The references to Christ did not appear nearly so frequently
as the above mentioned concepts. The prevailing nature of the
religion reﬂected in the books was more in harmony with the
spirit and stories of the Old Testament than the New. In this
regard Warren states, “Much more palatable for children’s taste
in reading than theological considerations is the relationship of
Jesus to our way of life and our daily interests.” Thus the
thoughts relating to Christ dealt mostly with his exampleship in
exhibiting virtues and wisdom, bearing responsibility, suffering,
and then dying for us. Very few of these ideas appeared after
1850. Likewise the references to the Bible were not very frequent,
and then mainly between 1820 and 18435. The Bible was referred
to as the Book of God, source of happiness and inspiration, and
important as a basis for life.

Even though the more or less purely religious concepts largely
disappeared in readers shortly
after 1850, references to mor-
als and conduct continued
much longer. However, the
individualistic rather than so-
cial virtues were emphasized
throughout. Warren says,
“With similar tenacity, suc-
cessive and contemporary
writers, through repeated
editions and revisions, con-

tinued to present certain familiar stories and speciﬁc teachings.
This seems to have had much to do with sustaining the religious
tone of the books long after the technically religious elements
had disappeared.” In other words, the authors and compilers of
readers were loath to abandon totally the dual purpose of teach-
ing children to read and inspiring them to live noble lives. For
example, the Lord’s Prayer in verse appeared in a number of
readers including the popular lVIcGuffey and Sanders series, as
follows:

Our Father in heaven,

We hallow thy name!

May thy kingdom holy,

On earth be the same!

0, give to us daily

Our portion of bread!

It is from thy bounty

That all must be fed.

Forgive our transgressions,

And teach us to know

That humble compassion,

That pardons each foe.

Keep us from temptation,

From weakness and sin,

And thine be the glory,

Forever —— Amen!

Myth, Folklore, Fairy Story, and Fable. Commonly myths, folk-
lore, fairy stories, and fables dealt with morals and ways of
conduct. Thus when these four types of lessons are grouped
together they constitute the most frequent appearing topic after
1875, according to Robinson’s study. During the 1875-1915

period nearly one-ﬁfth and during 1915-1926 period more than

one—fourth of the lessons were classified under these types. This
would indicate that before the 1875-1915 period the teaching -of
religious and moral concepts was attempted more or less through
the direct method or approach, while after that date they were
more largely taught by means of stories and the different forms
of literature. The latter approach was more in harmony with
Pestalozzian and Herbartian principles of teaching.

Animals, Birds, and Nature Study. An-other type of content

58 OLD TEXTBOOKS

which became more and more popular by the middle of the last
century was that dealing with animals, birds, and nature study.
Robinson found that more than one—fourth of the lessons after
1825 dealt with them. Evidently the attention given to animals
and birds was the beginning of what is now known in the elemen-
tary schools as nature study. Both Pestalozzianism and the
Oswego Object Lesson movement contributed greatly to this
attention. In fact, Sheldon in his Less0'ns on Objects (1863)
listed many other forms of biological life besides animals and
birds. Certainly, any teacher carrying out Sheldon’s suggestions
would have been teaching nature study.

Boys and Girls. After 1875 an increased number of lessons dealt
with boys and girls. During
the 1875-1915 period 18.5
per cent and during the 1915-
1926 period 10.5 per cent
related to boys and girls. This
certainly Was in harmony with
the growing psychological at-
tention given to the nature,
interests, and the study of the
child.

Literature. The most thor-
ough treatment of the devel-
opment of the literary content
of American readers was made
by Davis.8 His study clearly

reveals that the compilers of

school readers recognized the value of literature as an important
feature of textbook content. He states, “This resumé shows that
the compilers have regarded literature as a powerful agent for
the teaching of political, social, moral, and religious lessons.” He
refers to such prefatory statements found in readers, as “master-
pieces of style,” “literary masterpieces,” and “the best in Eng-
lish and American literature.”

The percentage of the literary content in the readers varied
somewhat from decade to decade, and among authors. Certain
objectives affected the amount of literary content. For example,
the readers that emphasized the didactic did not include as much
good literature as those aiming to present mainly selections of
superior literary value. The readers from 1860 to 1900 con-
sistently included a higher percentage of excellent literature than

60 OLD TEXTBOOKS

the readers of the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century. Prefatory
statements in the readers after 1860 deﬁnitely indicated that the
authors aimed to emphasize literature rather than history or
science. However, there was at least one curbing inﬂuence in the
later readers; namely, as the authors became more conscious of
the interests and needs of children, the selections chosen for that
purpose often lacked literary quality. Naturally this would apply
more fully to the lower rather than the advanced readers. The
McGuffey Readers particularly contained many selections of
superior literary value.

Toward the end of the last century several authors even in-
dicated by the titles of their readers that the literary element
would bestressed. In 1897 Stepping Stones to Literature—A
Reader for Sixth Grades by Sarah Arnold and C. B. Gilbert was
published. In 1898 Lights to Literature, a first reader, by Avis
Purdue and Florence LaVictoire, and a second reader by Sarah
Sprague were published. Then in 1900 the Graded Literature
Readers by Harry P. Judson and Ida C. Bender appeared.
It is evident that literary content received increasing attention

around 1900.

Special Readers. A consider-
able number of readers bore
titles indicating either a spe-
cial type of content or an ap-
peal to a special group. A
number of readers were writ-
ten particularly for girls or
young ladies, such as Bailey’s
The Young Ladies Class
Book (1831). Several were
religious in purpose, such as
Collier’s The Evangelical In-
structor (1811), and Emer-
son’s The Evangelical Primer

(1811). In 1822 Blake’s The Historical Reader was published,

which later reappeared in numerous editions. Other specially
titled books were: The Etymological Reader (187%) by Epes
Sargent and Amasa May; Carpenter’s Geographical Readers (A
Series) beginning in 1899; Judson’s The Young American——
A Civic Reader (1897) ; and Wilson’s Nature Study in Elemen-
tary Schools: Second Reader (1898).

Speakers. Nearly all readers until just before 1900 emphasized
the mastery of effective oral reading or elocution. While this
emphasis was more or less common for reading at all levels; it
was often the prime objective in the advanced readers. Not only
was this true in the upper books of a series, but many special
advanced readers were published for this purpose. This was
persistently true from the appearance of some of the earliest
readers and up to the end of the nineteenth century. Their titles
usually contained one or more of the following deﬁnitive terms:
Speaker, orator, rhetorical guide or manual, elocution or elocu-
tionary, vocal culture, dialogues, or dramatic. The Writer’s col-
lection contains approximately seventy—ﬁve books that may be
classiﬁed as elocutionary or
rhetorical readers or speakers.
A number of them appeared
in numerous editions.

It is quite clear Why speak-
ing and oratory became popu-
lar in our early national
history. In the first place, the
democratic political develop-
ment of our country required
the election of persons to pub-
lic office. So public speaking
on the part of the candidates
and their friends became com-
mon. Thus effective public a

speaking became important. Likewise, in the field of religion,
evangelists held revival and camp meetings, demanding effivztive
oral appeals. Thus to prepare the youth for future effective par-
ticipation in activities requiring public speaking, the authors of
textbooks prepared readers suitable for the development of ef-
fective oral delivery. Some were special books to serve this purpose
solely, others did so more particularly in the upper readers of a
series.

As early as 17 85, H. Gaine’s The Art of Speaking was printed
in New York. In the same year the first English reader written
by an American appeared; namely, Noah Webster’s American
Selection of Lessons in Reading and Speaking. The very be-
ginning of this book dealt with rules and examples for “Reading
and Speaking.” In 1797 The 0rator’s Assistant; Being a Selec-
tion of Dialogues by Alexander Thomas was published. It con-
tained many famous literary dialogues, such as the one by Brutus
and Cassius, and one by Cato, Lucius, and Sempronius. In 1799
Caleb Bingham’s Cola/mbian Orator was published. A prefatory
comment stated that the selections were “calculated particularly
for Dialogue and Declamation.” The first 23 pages dealt with
“General Instructions for Speaking.” Then the reading selections
were preceded by the following statement: “Practical Pieces for
Speaking; consisting of Orations, Addresses, Exhortations from
the Pulpit, Pleadings at the Bar, Sublime Descriptions, Debates,
Declamations, Grave and Humorous Dialogues, Poetry, etc.”
Editions of this book continued to appear for at least four
decades.

The next popular text of this type was William Scott’s Lessons
in Elocution (1814:), or “A Selection of Pieces, in Prose and
Verse, for the Improvement of Youth in Reading and Speaking.”
The “Elements of Gesture” were illustrated by four plates. Part
II presented the following types of lessons: Eloquence of the
Senate, Eloquence of the Bar, Speeches on Various Subjects,
Dramatic Pieces: Dialogues, Speeches, and Soliloquies.

The most popular one of all was Ebenezer Porter’s The
Rhetorical Reader, first published in 1831. It still appeared in the
1860’s. The first 70 pages deﬁned and discussed reading, articu-
lation, inﬂection, accent, emphasis, modulation, and gesture. Then

READERS 6'3

60 pages were devoted to technical exercises pertaining to the
above. Lastly, there were 170 pages of literary selections for oral
exercises. Most of the latter were by recognized literary authors.

In 1843 Parley Pippin published The 0rator’s Ladder in three
parts. The title page included a picture showing ten ladders each
of ten steps reaching above the clouds toward the sky with a
different sized learner on each ladder. The symbolism of the pic-
ture was to carry “the learner quite above the level of the common
plan of learning to read.” Similar special books for “speakers”
continued until 1900, but only a few became popular.

Beginning in the 184s0’s special books for “speakers” were
largely replaced by readers appearing in series, usually in series
of ﬁve or six. Then commonly the ﬁfth, or the sixth, or both,
would contain the word “speaker” or “rhetorical” in the title.
One of the ﬁrst of these was Alexander (not William) McGuﬁ"ey’s
Rhetorical Guide or Fifth Reader in 1844. The ﬁrst 60 pages of
this dealt with the principles of elocution. Next appeared
Richard Parker’s Exercises in Rhetorical Reading in 1849. Epes
Sargent’s The Standard Speaker was published in 1852. The
Sanders Series, which provided keen competition for the Mc-
Guffey Series, included the
Rhetorical, or Union Fifth
Reader, and the Rhetorical, or
Union Sixth Reader. In 1854
Salem Town’s Fifth or Elocu-
tionary Reader appeared. In
1874: Hillard and Sprague’s
The Franklin Sixth Reader
and Speaker was published.
One appearing in a popular
series of readers was William
Swinton’s F ifth Reader and
Speaker in 1883. All of these
ﬁfth and sixth readers ap-
peared in numerous editions.

From the foregoing data it is clear that oral rather than silent
reading was deemed more important until nearly 1900.

Summary of Content. A thorough examination of thetable shows
that readers Varied greatly in the attention given the various
topics, in any particular period, and that also gthere was great
variation relating to particular topics in the different periods.
Some topics were never given more than 5 per cent of the space
in any period.

MOST POPULAR AMERICAN READERS

Noah Webster (17544-184:3). Webster wrote the first American
written reader in 1785; he had also written the ﬁrst popular
American speller. It was the “Third Part of a Grammatical In-
stitute of the English Language”; the First Part having been the
S peller, and the Second Part the Grammar. The title of the
reader was An American Se-
lection of Lessons in Reading
and Speaking. Its contents
consisted of: Rules for Read-
ing and Speaking, Lessons in
Reading, Lessons in Speak-
ing, Dialogues, Poetry, and
Appendix. The lessons in
reading were largely moral in
character, such as “Honesty
Rewarded,” and “Character
of a Young Lady.” The les-
sons in speaking and the dia-
logues were largely historical
and patriotic in nature, such
as “Oration on the Boston
Massacre,” and “Brutus and

Cassius.” This reader was printed in several cities and by 1789
had appeared as the sixth edition. In 1790 Webster wrote The
Little Readers Assistant, which apparently did not become as
popular as the Selection. In 1802 he published the Elements of
Knowledge, Vol. I, which contained a “Historical and Geographi-
cal Account of the United States; for the Use of Schools.” This
book apparently served the joint purpose of being a reader, his-
tory, and geography. Such correlation was rather usual in those
early days before separate and distinct books in the different
subject ﬁelds were common. This book appeared in numerous
editions. Although Webster wrote three readers, they did not
constitute a graded series.

Caleb Bingham (1757-1819). Bingham was the second American
author whose readers became popular. In 1794: his The American
Preceptor was published. This was followed in 1797 by The
Colnmbian Orator. Both books appeared in many editions, even
after 1850. Why did they become so popular? Evidently because
they fulﬁlled the two primary aims of the teaching of reading
then; namely, the teaching of
morals, and of elocution or
speaking. The chief purpose
of the Preceptor was to teach
moral precepts. In thepreface
he stated in part:

Convinced of the impropriety
of instilling false notions into
the minds of the children, he
has not given place to roman-
tic ﬁction. Although moral es-
says have not been neglected;
yet pleasing and interesting
stories, exemplifying moral
virtues, were judged best cal-

culated to engage the attention and improve the heart. Tales of love
have not gained admission. . . . neitheraword . . . would “raise a
blush on the cheek of modesty.”

The following were some of the lesson titles: “On the Duty of
School Boys,” “Character of Fidelia,” “Filial Duty and Affec-
tion,” and a rather morbid title, “The Child Trained up for the
Gallows.” The book contained 100 lessons.

The Colambian Orator was “calculated to improve youth and
others in the ornamental and useful Art of Eloquence.” On the
title page Rollin was quoted as saying, “Cato cultivated Elo-
quence, as a necessary mean for defending the Rights of the
People, and for enforcing good counsels.” The book contained
841 oratorical exercises, most of which were extracts of famous
speeches by such famous men as Washington, Cato, Milton,
Buonaparte, Cassius, Pitt, Fox, and others. The Colwmbéan
Orator continued in publication even much longer than the
Preceptor. These books did not constitute a graded series. Evi-
dently they were used in the upper grades of schools and in
academies. C

Lindley Murray (1745-1826). Early readers which became even
more popular in America than those of Webster and Bingham
were written in England by Murray, who was born, reared, and
educated in America. The writer’s collection contains 36 copies
each bearing a different title, date, or printer. The first one was
published in 1799. It was The English Reader, “or Pieces in
Prose and Poetry, selected from the best Writers, designed to assist
young persons to read with Propriety and Effect, to improve
their language and sentiments; and to inculcate some of the most
important Principles of Piety and Virtue.” Since this book Was
written in England, Where Latin and Greek readers were still in
common academic use, he called this The English Reader. Al-

though in the sub—title Murray referred to its purposes as teach-

ing effective oral reading and virtue, he evidently aimed at much
broader purposes for the teaching of reading. An examination of
the table of contents shows that he conceived of the reading
selections as being literature, classifying them under prose and
poetry, and further presenting them as representing different

READERS 67

types of literature. The prose pieces were classiﬁed in the different
chapters, as narrative, didactic, argumentative, descriptive, pa-
thetic, dialogues, public speeches, and promiscuous pieces. The
chapters of poetry were: Select.sentences, narrative, didactic, de-
scriptive, and promiscuous pieces. a

In 1800 the Sequel to the English Reader and in 1801 the
Introduction to the English Reader were published. The stated
purposes and the plan of presenting the lessons of these two books
were about the same as in The English Reader. In a sense these
three books were to constitute a series. In the preface of the
Introduction Murray stated that “it has been his aim to form
a compilation, which would properly conduct the young learner
from the Spelling-book to the English ‘Reader.’ ” It must be
kept in mind that at that time, before regular.reading primers
were common, most children learned to readfrom the simple
reading lessons in the spellers. Thus the Introduction was to be
used between a speller and The English Reader, and these to be
followed by the Sequel. All three presented the reading selections
in chapters under the above mentioned types of literature. The

only differences, according to Murray, were in the length and

difficulty of the reading material. None of these books made any
use of learning aids, such as questions, pictures, or word lists.

Apparently printers all over the United States felt free to
reprint these books for their own proﬁt. The 36 above mentioned
copies were published by 22 different printers. Among these the
latest one appeared in 1848. The wide appearances of these
readers is ample evidence that the l\Iurray books were widely used
in the schools of the United States during the first half of the
nineteenth century.

John Pierpont (1785-1866). Many readers were published be-
tween the first appearance of the Murray Readers and those by
Pierpont, but none gained wide acceptance, except Scott’s
Lessons in Elocution, which has been discussed elsewhere. Like
several other early authors, he ﬁrst wrote his most advanced book,
The American First Class Book; or, Exercises in Reading and
Recitation, in 1823. He succeeded in having the School Com-
mittee of Boston adopt this book to replace Scott’s Lessons. It

68 OLD TEXTBOOKS

was a large book of 480 pages. Unlike most advanced readers, no
rules for elocution were included. In organization he rather
closely followed Murray. Part First. Lessons in Prose. In order
the following appeared: Narrative, Descriptive, Didactick, Pathet-
ick, Dramatick, Humorous, and Miscellaneous Pieces, and with

some for Recitation. In Part Second the poetic pieces in the same

order were presented.

In 1827 Pierpont compiled The National Reader. It was
adopted in Boston to replace Murray’s English Reader. It was
200 pages smaller than his Class Book, and thus could precede
the latter. The lessons in it were not classified. In the mean-
time, Pierpont apparently began to think of a series, so in 1838
he prepared the Introduction to the Reader. By 1835 it reached
its sixteenth edition. In 1830 there followed The Young Reader
to precede the Introduction, and soon thereafter The Little
Learner. Thus ﬁve books constituted Pierpont’s series of readers.
The idea of a series apparently was an afterthought, for they
were prepared in the exact reverse order to the sequence in which
other later series were compiled. It may also be noted that they
were not called First, Second,
etc., or No. 1, No. 2. Never-
theless his readers went
through numerous editions.

Lyman Cobb (1800-1864).
Cobb apparently was the first
author to conceive a really
graded series of readers, and
to begin with the lowest reader.
In 1830 he published the J u*oe-
nile Reader, No. 1. On the
title page a statement said
that it contained “interesting,
moral, and instructive Read-
ing Lessons, composed of easy

liest well—graded series.

READERS 69

words of one and two syllables.” It was a simple book of 72 pages
with ﬁve pictures. The next year the Juvenile Reader, No. 2
was published. It used words of one, two, and three syllables.

.It contained 144: pages and six pictures. In the reading lessons

the paragraphs were numbered. Also in 1831 the Juvenile Reader,
N o. 3 appeared. It contained 212 pages, and words with a greater
number of syllables, but no pictures. In 1832 he wrote a larger
book entitled, Sequel to the Juvenile Readers.

Beginning in 1842 he revised several of these books. The second
one was changed to New Juvenile Reader, N 0. II, and the reading
content was greatly reduced, but each reading lesson was preceded
with a list of its key words together with their meaning and
pronunciation. In 1843 the Sequel was changed to the New
Sequel, or Fourth Reading Book. It also interspersed the reading
lessons with word lists. A note before the first lesson stated,
“This Spelling Lesson contains all the words of Reading Lesson I,
which were not in any Reading Lesson, contained in Juvenile
Reader, Nos. I, II, or’III.” The first word appeared as follows:

4: 41 1 1 -
“A bil i t y (a bil le te), n. capacity, skill; power; means.”

He also wrote the North American Reader, which evidently was
meant to be a ﬁfth reader. It is evident that Cobb made a deﬁnite
contribution in the development of serially graded readers.

Samuel Worcester. As early as 1826 Worcester published A
Primer of the English Language. It is not certain whether at
that time he meant this to be the beginning of a series, for his
later books did not appear for several years. In some respects
it imitated the New England Primer by illustrating the letters of
the alphabet with pictures. He then went further by using visual
aids with lessons. For example, Lesson III, in part, follows:

A nice Fan.
This is a nice Fan.

Some spelling lists interspersed the reading lessons. It had a limp
paper backed cover.
In 1880 A Second Book for Reading and Spelling was pub-

lished, soon followed by A Third Book. A Fourth Book of Lessons
for Reading was published in 1884. The attention to spelling was

'70 OLD TEXTBOOKS

diminished, but each lesson was preceded by a rule of something
involved in the lesson and then each was followed by errors and
questions. Then ten years later An Introduction to the Third
Book for Reading and Spelling appeared. It contained Q-64¢ pages,
and each lesson was preceded by “errors to be avoided” and fol-
lowed by questions about the content of the lessons. While several
of the Worcester Readers were published in several editions, they
did not become popular.

One interesting incident may be added here. When William
McGuffey first wrote his Third Reader in 1837 he used several
selections from a Worcester book. In turn Worcester sued Mc-
Guffey and his publisher. It was settled out of court, and
McGuffey immediately revised his book.

B. D. Emerson. In 1833 Emerson, a principal of a grammar
school in Boston, prepared The First—Class Reader. The same
year The Second—Class Reader was published. Then in 18344
The Third—Class Reader appeared. Peculiarly, The First—Class
Reader was the advanced book for upper grades, The Second-
Class Reader was “designed for the use of the middle class of
schools,” and The Third—Class Reader “for the use of the younger
classes.” He may have been inﬂuenced by the practice in which the
Boston Latin Grammar School numbered its grades or “forms”
in reverse order. These books were published in several editions.

William Holmes M cGaﬂey (1800-1873). The best known text-
books ever written in our country were the McGuffey Readers,
even out-distancing the N ew England Primer and Noah Web-
ster’s blue—backed Speller in sale. Many factors helped make them
famous. In addition to their good original authorship there should
be mentioned the vision and energy of the publishers, the geo-
graphical location of the publishing company, the careful re-
visions, and the nature and demand of the times when they
appeared. -

McGuffey was born in a log cabin in southwestern Pennsyl-
vania, and when still very young his family moved to near
Youngstown, Ohio. Apparently he learned the rudiments of
elementary education from his mother, and together with his

READERS 71

sister Jane received some training in a private school operated
by a Reverend Wick in Youngstown. Later he attended Grreers-
burg (later called Darlington) Academy in Pennsylvania near
the Ohio line, Where he lived in the principal’s home earning his
Way by doing chores. In 1819 he entered Washington and J effer-
son College in Pennsylvania. He accepted a teaching position at
Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, even before receiving his degree
at Washington and Jefferson.

After spending ten years teaching at Miami he accepted the
presidency of the reorganized Cincinnati College. However, the
ﬁnancial panic ruined its success. Then in 1839 he became presi-

dent of Ohio University, at Athens, Ohio. There, likewise, he met
difficulties in ﬁnancing the operation of the school. Evidently his
talents were those of a scholar rather than of an administrator.
After four rather unhappy years there he accepted aprofessor-
ship in languages at Woodward College, Cincinnati. Then in
1845 he went to Charlottesville as professor of political economy
and moral philosophy at the University of Virginia. There he
remained until his death in 1873. While there he distinguished
himself as a great scholar, lecturer, teacher, and advocate of a
state public school system, which was established before his death,
with a former student as its ﬁrst superintendent.

But how and when did the McGuffey Readers come to be?
During McGuffey’s stay in Ohio the Ohio Valley was developing
very rapidly, with Cincinnati as its center of activity. There many
activities were taking place——industrially, ﬁnancially, religiously,
socially, educationally, and culturally. It became the mid—west’s
distribution center, including the distribution of books. Numerous
printing presses and book binderies were set up. Among the larger
printers or publishers was the ﬁrm of Truman and Smith. Most
of its early books were merely reprints of standard works likely
to have a sale in the mid—west. Their ﬁrst copyrighted book was
The Child’s Bible (1834). Also in that year they published
Joseph Ray’s Eclectic Arithmetic, which was the first -of a very
successful series of arithmetics, and also Lowell Mason’s famous
Sacred Harp.

In the meantime, W. B. Smith of the ﬁrm, a man of vision
and energy, envisioned the publication of a series of readers which
would be properly adapted to the habits, energy, and ideals of
the frontier people of the West. He felt that the eastern written
books failed to meet their needs. He ﬁrst approached Catherine
Beecher, a sister of Harriet Beecher Stowe, to write the Readers.
However, she was engaged in founding and developing the Hart-
ford Female Seminary. Next he approached McGuffey, who al-
ready had been working on a series of readers. So on April 28, 1886,
he made a contract with Truman and Smith for a graded series
of four readers. The First and Second were already in prepara-
tion, and the Third and Fourth were to be completed in eighteen
months. The terms of the contract called for a 10 per cent royalty

READERS 73

on all books until the sum should reach $1,000, after which the
Readers would become the absolute property of the publishers.
Later William McGuffey was paid to write the Sixth Reader, and
his brother Alexander was paid for writing the Fifth. Beyond
that the McGruffeys received little or no compensation for these
famous Readers, except a few voluntary gifts from the publishers.
Mr. Louis Dillman, president of the American Book Company in
1920, estimated that seven million copies were sold during 1836-
1850, forty million during 1850-1870, sixty million during 1870-
1890, and ﬁfteen million during the 1890-1920 period. Many
copies have been sold since. In all, Well over 1%%,000,000 copies
have been sold.

A word should be said about the publishers. Truman did not
agree with Smith regarding the future success of textbooks.
After some differences, it is said that Smith came to the shop
early one morning and made two piles of their books. On one
he placed all the miscellaneous books, including the Child’s Bible,
the Sacred Harp, and the firm’s cash; and on the other pile he
put the half dozen small textbooks, including the four McGuffey
Readers. When Truman came he was given the choice of the
piles. As expected he took the first pile. Thus VV. B. Smith be-
came the sole publisher of the Readers. As a consequence the
following firms have been the parent publishers of the McGuffey
Readers:

Truman and Smith 1834-1841
W. B. Smith 1841-1852
W. B. Smith & Company 1852-1863
Sargent, Wilson & Hinkle 1863-1868
Wilson, Hinkle & Company 1868-1877
Van Antwerp, Bragg & Company 1877-1890
American Book Company 1890-

The First and Second Readers appeared in 1836, and the
Third and Fourth Readers in 1837. In 1838, Truman and Smith
were sued for infringement of copyright, for allegedly having
copied material from Worcest.er’s Second, Third, and Fourth
Readers. The case was settled out of court, and the Second and
Third Readers were immediately revised by McGuffey. Numerous
later revisions were made in order to improve the books. The
First Reader was revised in 1841, 1844, and 1848; the Second
in 1838, 1841, and 1844; the Third in 1838, 1843, and 1848; the
Fourth in 1844 and 1848. The Fifth Reader, written by Alex-
ander McGuffey, was published in 1844. In 1853 all ﬁve readers
reappeared as “Newly Revised.” In 1857 some changes were
made in the gradation and redistribution of some lesson ma-
terials, and the Sixth and High School Reader were ﬁrst pub-
lished. In 1879 all six readers were rather radically revised and
appeared in uniform binding in brown. Then ﬁnally in 1901 and
in 1920 they were recopyrighted with only slight changes.

Interestingly the McGuffeys had very little to do with the re-
visions. For them, the publishers must be given considerable

credit in employing very competent help. Whether outside help
was employed to avoid giving the McGuffeys heavy royalties, as
has been suggested, is not certain. The first one employed by
Smith was Dr. Timothy S. Pinneo, Who later became the author
of a popular series of Grammars published by Smith. Some -of
the minor revisions were made by members of the publishing
staﬁ’, especially by Obed J. Wilson. Of all the revisions, the one
made in 1878-1879 was both the most radical and most popular;
for sixty million copies of this edition were later sold. The per-
sons employed to make this revision were Robert W. Stevenson
of Columbus and Miss Amanda Funnelle of Terre Haute for the
first three readers; and Edwin C. Hewett of Bloomington, Illi-
nois, and Thomas W. Harvey of Ohio for the upper three

readers. Harvey later became the author of at very popular
series of grammars published by the same company. Also, the
publishers secured criticisms from selected teachers.

Next, attention must be given to the appealing features of
the Readers. One feature was the use of the Word “Eclectic”
with the books and series. This is not a Very familiar word now,
but must have been then. It means “choice, or selective.” Since
McGuffey was a scholarly man, he took great pains to include
in the Readers largely choice lesson materials. For example, the
cover of an early Eclectic Third Reader mentioned that it con-
tained “Selections in Prose and Poetry from the Best American
and English Writers.” The Fourth said that it contained “Ele-
gant Extracts in Prose and Poetry.” It has often been claimed
that the literary pieces in the McGuffey Readers often consti-

tuted the only real literature many of its readers ever read.
However, there were two drawbacks to including largely only
choice literary pieces. One was that too often the vocabulary in

these selections was ill adapted to the age level of the children

using the books. The application of the Yoakam Readability
Formula to an early edition of the Second Reader revealed that
its vocabulary was at the eighth grade reading level. The second
drawback was that often the choice literary selections contained
concepts too difficult for a full understanding by children. For
example, the 1848 edition of the Third Reader contained a selec-
tion entitled “Metaphysics.” Hughes found that all of the differ-
ent editions of the McGuffey Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Readers
contained a total of 1,067 separate titles. Of these, 247 appeared
in readers of more than one level, and 607 appeared only once.
The fact that 607 appeared only once, and that more than 23
per cent appeared in readers of more than one level is proof that
experience with the use of the early readers revealed poor grading
of the selections. Five of the ﬁfteen most frequently repeated
titles appeared in readers of all three levels. Thus by trial and
error the gradation improved in the later editions. It may be
added, however, that these two drawbacks were not common only
to the McGuﬁ°ey Readers, but to other readers as well, during
the period covered. It is the impression of the writer, who has
examined hundreds of old readers, that McGuffey’s were less
guilty than most other readers in this respect.

The positive merits of the McGuffey Readers greatly out-
weighed their weaknesses, especially when compared with their
competitors. One feature was the systematic way the pupils were
guided in the process of learning to read. The older way was
to learn to spell first and then to read. The McGuffey First
Readers began with words used in sentences, and usually the
content of the sentences was related to accompanying pictures.
The Third Readers early included “Plain Rules for Reading.”
The 1843 edition even included lessons in enunciation. At that
time oral reading was strongly emphasized. The 1844 edition of
the Fourth began with 26 pages dealing with such matters as
articulation, tones, inﬂections, and emphasis. The first edition
of the Fifth (1844) devoted 48 pages to an “Analysis of the

78 OLD TEXTBOOKS

Principles of Elocution,” which ended with a list of “character”
keys to denote the different qualities of elocution. Then the
lessons were interspersed with these “characters” to assist the
students in effective oral reading. For example (/) denoted rising
inﬂection, and (\) falling inflection. Later editions contained
even more helps. The 1857 edition of the Fourth defined the key
words before each lesson and asked questions or suggested exer-
cises after the lesson.

Another feature of the McGuffey lower Readers was the use
of short sentences and brief lessons. The first edition of the
Second Reader (1836) had 85 lessons in 164 pages of content.
Furthermore, the paragraphs were usually short and were num-
bered. The later revised editions had even shorter sentences and
paragraphs.

A third feature that was more or less characteristic of the
Readers in all their editions was the human interest appeal. For
example, a lesson entitled “The Three Cakes” as used in
some contemporary readers was called “Three Boys and Three
Cakes” by McGuffey; “The Little Boats” was changed to “The
Little Sailor Boys”; and “The Guide Post” to “Harry and the
Guide Post.”

Closely related to the human appeal was the way in which
morals were taught in the McGuffey Readers. Such moral quali-
ties as honesty, truth and truthfulness, obedience, temperance,
kindness to humans and animals, thrift, work, and patriotism
were largely taught by means of actual human and situational
stories. Note the following titles taken from the 1853 edition of
the Third Reader: “Harry and the Dog,” “Perseverance,” “The
Song of the Dying Swan,” “The Noblest Revenge,” “The Good-
ness of God,” “The Generous Russian Peasant,” “Try, Try
Again,” “We Are Seven,” and “Touch Not———Taste Not———Handle
Not.” .

It has been recognized by students of history that the lessons
in the McGuffey Readers did much to set the standards of mo-
rality and of the social life in the pioneering west for more than
half a century. Many of the truths and poetic expressions memo-
rized from these Readers were quoted by parents, preachers, and
others to counteract acts of intemperance, vulgarity, laziness,

brutality, dishonesty, and lawlessness, which were altogether too
common among frontier people.  

Even the pictures upheld the standards. The earliest editions
of the Primer, and First and Second Readers contained pictures.
The Third Reader had only a few until the 1857 edition, which
contained many. The same was true of the Fourth. The Fifth
and Sixth contained no pictures until the 1879 edition, and then
only a few.

Many distinguished Americans who were reared west of the
Appalachians, where the McGuffey Readers held dominant sway,
have acknowledged the deep debt they owe to the lessons learned
from these Readers. Among them may be mentioned Henry Ford,
Senator Borah, Senator Beveridge, William McKinley, Lew
Wallace, James Whitcomb Riley, Mark Twain, Rutherford
Hayes, Robert LaFollette, and thousands of others. The National
Education Association, in its 1873 national convention, passed

80 OLD TEXTBOOKS

the following memorial resolution to a great teacher and col-
league:

Resolved, 1. That in the death of William H. McGuffey, late Pro-
fessor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Virginia, this Asso-
ciation feels that they have lost one of the greatest lights of the
profession whose life was a lesson full of instruction, an example
and model to American teachers.

2. That his labors in the cause of education extending over a period
of half a century, in the several offices of teacher of common schools,
college professor and college president, and as author of textbooks;
his inﬂuence upon his pupils and community; his care for the public
interests of education; his lofty devotion to duty; his conscientious
Christian character———all these have made him one of the noblest
ornaments of our profession in this age, and entitle him to the grate-
ful remembrance of this Association and of the teachers of America.

S. G. Goodrich (1793-1860). Goodrich, whose early writings ap-
peared under the pen name of Peter Parley, wrote textbooks in
many ﬁelds. Nearly all of these books contained many pictures,
certainly many more than there were in most other textbooks
during their time. In 1839 The Co.mpreherosi*oe Readers, a series
of four, were printed in Louisville. Most of his other books were
printed in the East. One may wonder why he had these printed
in the West. It may be that he hoped to cash in on the growing
demand for textbooks on the frontier, as W. B. Smith hoped to
do with the McGuffey Readers. The First and Second Readers
contained many pictures and simple lessons to appeal to children.
The Third contained no pictures and in general was unattractive.
The lessons were followed by questions regarding words, pro-
nunciation, and the content. The Fourth was much more technical
in nature. It began with eight pages of rules for oral reading,
followed by ﬁfteen pages dealing with preﬁxes and roots. No
questions, pictures, or exercises accompanied the lessons. The
First and Second’ were revised in 1846, and a Fifth and Sixth
were added in 1857, which were edited by Noble Butler. Good-
rich’s Readers never became as popular as his history and ge-
ography books.

Charles W. Sanders (1805-1889). In the 1840’s, and even later,
the Sanders’ School Readers were the most popular readers in

READERS 81

the East. In 1840 he published the Primer, and the First and
Second School Readers; in 1841 the Third; and in 1842 the
Fourth. In 1848 the Fifth appeared, and in 1862 the Sixth. In
addition to the School Readers he published a series of the so-.
called. Union Readers in the 1860’s, with the Fifth and Sixth
bearing the additional term of Rhetorical. Also, in 1855 he had
prepared a special reader for use in the “Higher Female Semi-
naries” entitled Young Ladies Reader. Most of these Readers
were revised and recopyrighted a number of times. For example,
the First was copyrighted in 1840, 1853, and 1861; the Second
in 1840,1853, and 1860; the Third in 1841, 1855, and 1860; the
Fourth in 1842, 1854, 1855, and 1863.

Sanders’ Primer and First Reader from the beginning had
many pictures,large type, and were pleasant to read. He stated
that the first ﬁfty pages of the First Reader contained mono-
syllables and the dissyllables were gradually introduced. The ﬁrst
edition of the Second had only two pictures, but the later editions
contained many. Most of the lessons were preceded by key word
lists. In the 1861 edition these words were even deﬁned. He
aimed, not to present classical
literary pieces, which he con-
sidered too diﬁicult for chil-
dren, but to present lessons
which would be meaningful,
carefully graded, interesting,
and of high moral value. Nu-
merous lessons in the First
Reader dealt with animals. In
the Second were lessons deal-
ing with animals, ﬁsh, birds,
and even insects. The ﬁrst
three lessons in the Third
were, “The Boy Rebuked by
his Dog,” “The Swallow and

the Red Breast,” and “The Sun—flower.” The lessons in the
Fourth dealt with a great variety of subjects, but very few of an
abstract nature. These readers represented a marked contrast
to the readers previously in common use in the East, which con-
tained many lessons of an abstract and a theological nature.

The School Reader, Fifth Book, was very different from the
first four readers. The first 58 pages dealt with “Rhetorical
Principles” treating such topics as, articulation, emphasis, in-
flection, modulation, expression, personation, rhetorical pause,
and poetical elocution. Part Second consisted largely of selec-
tions, both prose and poetry, taken from famous Writings. Ex-
planatory notes preceded many of the selections. The School
Readers series contained no sixth.

In 1861 Sanders began publishing the Union Readers. In the
preface of Number One he stated: “The increasing demand for
greater variety of exercises in reading, both in style and matter,
has led to the preparation of Sanders’ Union Series.” Every
lesson in Num.ber One was illustrated by a picture. In Number
Two each lesson was preceded by a list of defined key Words, and
about one—half of the lessons contained a picture. Number Three
was similar except the Word lists and lessons were longer, and
thirteen pages were devoted
to principles of elocution. The
Union Fourth Reader devoted
38 pages to elocution and
contained no pictures. The
aims were to “leave the best
moral impression” and to
“furnish the best possible ex-
ercises for practice in Rhetor-
ical reading.” The Union
Fifth was similar in make—up,
but presented lessons of a
more highly recognized lit-
erary quality. This series,

unlike the School series, included a Rhetorical, or Union Sixth
Reader. Sanders stated: “Viewed in the light of its primary
purpose, without reference to collateral aims, the present work
is simply a comprehensive course of reading.” Throughout, the
authors of the selections were identiﬁed.

In the preface of the Young Ladies’ Reader, Sanders quoted
the Younger Pliny as follows:

As in life, so in one’s studies, the most beautiful and the most humane is,
I think, so to blend the grave and the gay, that the one may not settle
down in melancholy, nor the other in levity.

He then proceeded to say that he aimed to do this in all his
Readers, but “more studiously” in this one. A few of the lesson
topics follow: “The Sense of Beauty,” “I Love to Live, and
Live to Love,” “The Wants of l\Ian,” “Domestic Life,” “The
Virtuous Woman,” “The Lovers Leap,” “Pride,” “The Talking
Lady,” “Moral Beauty,” “The Broken Hearted,” “The Needle.”

Sanders was a proliﬁc and successful textbook writer. In addi-
tion to the two series of readers, he was also the author of popular
spelling books. It has been estimated that about 13,000,000 of
his books were sold.

David B. Tower. Although all early readers seemed to have
greatly stressed exercises relating to oral reading, no author so
fully stressed the importance of letter sounds and their combina-
tions as did Tower. Today such exercises are called phonics. He
published The Gradual Reader, First Step; or, Exercises in
Articulation in 1841. Later this book became the third reader
in a series. In some introductory remarks he stated, “In using
the ‘Exercises,’ no regard should be paid to the meaning of the
examples. Let the whole attention be given to articulating the
Elementary Sounds and their Combinations distinctly and prop-
erly, and to pronouncing the words correctly.” The first 46
pages he devoted wholly to phonic exercises dealing with such
letter combinations, as bd, bld, bst, dzh, dldst, dths, glst, kndst,
ksth, lpst, and so on. These he followed by 142 pages of reading
lessons.

In 1845 Tower began his series of readers by publishing The

84 OLD TEXTBOOKS

Gradual Primer, or Primary School Euuuciator. It Was a rather
attractive book with fairly large type and many pictures, but
extreme attention was given to letter sounds. The next year
the Introduction to the Gradual Reader appeared as a second

‘reader. Soon, together with Cornelius Walker, he wrote the

Sequel to the Gradual Reader as a fourth. The emphasis on
phonics was not as strong in this book as in the Gradual Reader
(The Third).

The ﬁfth and sixth books in the series were written by the
same two men but bore the title, North American First Class
Reader; the Fifth Book in 1846, and the Sixth Book in 1848.
In these readers the emphasis changed from letters and letter
combinations to elocution. In the Fifth 64 pages dealt with prin-
ciples of elocution. The subsections were entitled Remarks on
Inﬂection, Stress, Tremulous Movement of the Voice, Emphasis,
Pause, and Circumﬂex. The subsections in the Sixth dealt with

Pitch, Monotone, Quantity, Rate, Semitone, Aspirated Function
of the Voice, Force, Feebleness of Voice, Suppressed Force, and
Transition. In both of these readers most of the reading selec-
tions were identiﬁed as to authorship, and represented rather
high literary quality. These Readers apparently attained con-
siderable circulation for more than a decade.

William D. Swan. In 184:4 a series of readers by Swan appeared.
The regular series consisted of The Primary School Reader,
Parts I, II, and III. This series was intended for use in the
primary schools. These were followed by The Grammar School
Reader. The regular series was then concluded with The District
School Reader; or, Exerrcises in Reading and Speaking. These
books either must have been considered good or Swan and his
publishers must have been good salesmen, for they were adopted
for use in at least twenty of the largest cities of Massachusetts,
including Boston. The lessons in these books, as was true of the
books by Sanders and McGuﬁ"ey, dealt with many topics, partic-
ularly with animals and stories involving a moral quality.

In contrast to most primary readers of that period, Swan did
not favor pictures. He criticized the use of “cuts” to illustrate
words and sentences by calling their use an “absurdity.” On the
other hand, he was strong for the use of phonics. Even in the
Part First (really the First Reader) the lessons were “arranged
upon the plan of teaching the powers of letters, as well as their
names. The attention is to be directed to onesound in each
lesson.” Thus he really began to stress elocution in the lowest
reader. For example, the first lesson in Part Second revealed his
scheme, as follows:

I will not blame the boys.

They did not mean to break my cup.
I can see the webs on the wall.

See me drive my new hoop.

The District School Reader began by devoting 52 pages to Prin-
ciples of Elocution. Swan went even into more detail here than
many of the so-called Speakers. He in ected short reading pieces
to be used for practice regarding the principles. In dealing‘ with
emphasis, he listed three degrees with practice examples, as
follows: 4

Single Emphasis

Study not so much to show knowledge as to acquire it.

Double Emphasis

To err is human; to forgive, divine.

Treble Emphasis
Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves,
Than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen.

In dealing with Tones of Voice he listed extracts illustrating
the following qualities: cheerfulness, mirth, joy, pity, hope,
hatred, anger, revenge, reproach, fear, grief, remorse, despair,
surprise, and malice. No aids for the pupil or teacher were con-
nected with the lessons.

In 1848 Swan published a supplementary reader entitled, The
Instractive Reader; or A Course of Reading in N atnral History,
Science and Literature. In defense, he said, “Many children are
compelled, from various causes, to leave school before completing,
or hardly commencing, a regular course of instruction upon
these subjects.” Nearly all of the lessons dealt with some aspect
of science. This book was intended for the upper grades. In
1850 he published The Introduction to the Instractive Reader.
It was designed for the primary and intermediate grades. Only
about half of the lessons dealt with science. Thus Swan was one
of the first authors to publish supplementary readers.

Salem Town (1779-1864). Town, like several others, was the
author of Very popular spellers as well as readers. He published
his First Reader in 1844. Quite different from most first readers,
which commonly began with the alphabet, or syllables, or easy
words, and often a picture, this one opened with a lesson entitled,
“The Lost Purse,” which covered three and one—half pages. Many
of the later lessons were interspersed with spelling words and

READERS 87

some pictures. The Second Reader, or Progressive Lessons ap-
peared later. It opened with a table of numbers and a table of
elementary sounds. The first lesson was short, and was accom-
panied with a picture and a list of words. Later in the book the
words to be spelled were also deﬁned. The Third Reader opened
with 48 pages devoted to rules and exercises related to effective
oral reading. It had no pictures, but the lessons contained de-
ﬁned words to be spelled and were followed by questions pertain-
ing to the lesson. In other words, the lessons were not only to be
read _well orally but also understood for meaning.

The Fourth Reader (184.37) opened with 66 pages dealing with
rules for oral reading, interspersed with illustrative reading
exercises. The authorship of the regular reading selections was
commonly identiﬁed. The last of the series was entitled Fifth
or Elocntionarg Reader. More than half of this book consisted
of elocutionary principles extensively applied to reading lessons.
Even regular lessons in the latter half of the book had parentheti-
cal notes referring to particular rules. For example, Lesson
XLVIII, “The Right of Free Discussion” by Webster, contained
the following note: [See Rule 3, p. 168, and Rule 12, p. 193]. In
1850 Town wrote the Grammar School Reader which was not a
part of a regular series, but which appeared in several editions.

In 1856 an entirely new series of readers appeared under the
joint authorship of Salem Town and Nelson M. Holbrook. Ap-
parently these were largely prepared by Holbrook, for the copy-
right was taken out in his name. Town’s name was apparently
used for its likely sales value, because his earlier readers were
well-known. These new readers were entitled Progressive Readers.
The First Progressive Reader was entirely new. It was attrac-
tively printed, and contained many pictures. It even attempted
to illustrate letter sounds by means of pictures. For example, a
with a picture of an ape, a with an arm, _a with an awl, 5. with an
ax, and so on. The Second was enlarged, and deﬁned the words
appearing at the beginning of each lesson. The Third devoted
more space to rules and exercises for good reading than the
earlier Third, and also introduced some pictures. The arrange-
ment of the Fourth was changed considerably. The rules and the
exercises were separated, not interspersed; and the regular lessons

88 OLD TEXTBOOKS

had deﬁned word lists at the beginning and thought provoking
questions at the end of each lesson. The first part of the Fifth
remained largely unchanged, but some of the regular reading
selections were changed. In other words, the Progressive Readers
largely constituted a new set of readers except the Fifth.

Henry M cmdeville. In 1846 he wrote A Course of Reading. This
book was intended for the upper grades and was Very different
from most upper readers of the period. It was divided into three
parts. The first contained a description of the letters of the
alphabet and their Various sounds, of syllables, and of words as
parts of speech. Short reading selections showing their uses were
interspersed. The second part dealt with a classiﬁcation and
description of sentences or formulas of thought, with detailed
instructions as to how they should be orally read. In other words,

the principles of elocution were taught by means of reading selec-
tions illustrating them. The third part was a sequel to the second
part. It contained longer selections involving the previously
taught principles. Before writing this book Mandeville had been
a minister, and at the time of writing was a professor of Moral
Science and Belles—Lettres at Hamilton College. The fact that he
was not engaged in public school work likely explains why the
book was a departure from common practice. Nevertheless the
book went through several editions.

In the late 184<0’s Mandeville began publishing a complete
graded series of five readers. The Primary and Second Reader
opened with the alphabet and short lists of words in script, be-
cause he believed that the children should learn to read both
print and script. Throughout, he correlated spelling and reading.
The readers also contained many pictures. The Third Reader

  was much more advanced and difficult than the Second. He de-

voted the first 22 pages to detailed instructions and exercises
for effective oral reading. Some of these certainly were too tech-
nical for a third reader. He used such terms as, “Exercise on

the Bend and Perfect Close,” “Upward Slide,” “A Combination
of the Bend, Close, and Slide,” “Exercises on Compellatives in

Connection with the Closes and Slides,” “Emphatic Sweeps,” and

“Exercises on Pitch, Force, and Rate.” Then 130 lessons were
presented on the remaining 178 pages. No pictures appeared in
this book. The Fifth Reader was composed of extracts of both
prose and poetry by well known writers or stories about signifi-
cant events. The literary selections were usually followed by a
brief biography of the author. The topics of the lessons were
very miscellaneous in character.

Richard G. Parker (1798-1869) and J. Madison Watson (1827-
1900). Parker ﬁrst gained his reputation as a textbook writer
in the fields of English composition and natural philosophy. His
Progressive Exercises in English Composition was ﬁrst published
in 1832 and was reprinted as late as 1879, and his School Com-
pendium in Natural and Experimental Philosophy in 1837 and
as late as 1871. Watson had also done some writing. In 1855
these. two authors joined their efforts in a series of National

.90 OLD TEXTBOOKS

Readers. The lowest one was the National First Reader, or Word
Builder. They claimed that the word—method united all the ad-
vantages of the old method by “first commencing with the alpha-
bet, and the new and preferable one, which begins with entire
words.” The Primer was restricted to 1,500 monosyllables, none
of which contained more than ﬁve letters. Most of the short
lessons were illustrated with pictures. The First had a few longer

words in the latter part of the book. The Second introduced

speciﬁc exercises in articulation, which usually was not done so
early in other series of readers. Interestingly a Third was written
by Parker alone in 1851 and contained no rules for reading. Then
in 1857 the two authors rewrote it, and included 30 pages of
rules and exercises before the regular reading lessons. It was
again revised in 1866.

The Fourth was also written alone by Parker in 1851, and
without elocutionary rules, which was contrary to common prac-
tice in fourth readers of that period. In 1857 the two revised it
and included 34 pages of principles of elocution. The Table of
Oral Elements listed Tonics, Subtonics, and Atonics. Then
Cognates received treatment. No word lists or questions accom-
panied the regular lessons. In 1866 it was again revised. The
National Sixth Reader aimed to be a “complete and sufficient
work for advanced classes in Reading, Elocution, and English
and American Literature.” It included many extensive biographi-
cal and explanatory notes in connection with recognized literary
selections. Most of these selections were extracts from well known
writers. This book was also revised several times. The National
Readers went through many revisions and reprintings and had
considerable circulation for at least two decades.

Even before the National Readers were written Parker had
published Exercises  Rhetorical Reading. This was a rather
technical and advanced book and likely was used mainly in
academies. It had several reprintings.

As Parker had written some of the readers alone, so also had
Watson. In 1858 he wrote the National School Primer, or
Primary Word-Builder. In 1868 he published a series of readers:
namely, the Independent Series. It consisted of six readers. For
example, the Fourth devoted 15 pages to orthoepy and 144 pages

READERS 91

to expression. It included several pictures. Few fourth readers
then had pictures. The Fifth and Sizcth were similar to the
Fourth only larger. This series also Went through several re-
printings.

Epes Sargent (1813—1880). Sargent, like several other authors
of readers, began by writing the most advanced one first. Thus
in 1852 he published The Standard Speaker, which was designed
for “schools, academies, lyceums, colleges.” After dealing with
the principles of elocution, he presented and classiﬁed the read-
ing selections, as moral and didactic, martial and popular, sena-
torial, forensic and judicial, political and occasional, narrative
and lyrical, scriptural and devotional, rhetorical and dramatic,
and comic and satirical. Later he wrote an Intermediate and a
Primary Standard Speaker. All these received several printings.

Next, in 1854:, he published The First Class Standard Reader.
This apparently was intended to be a sequel advanced reader to
the Speakers. The next year he made this a Fifth Reader, and
prepared a graded series by writing The First Standard Reader,
the Second, the Third, and the Fourth. The First and Second
were profusely illustrated with pictures. He mentioned that his
chief endeavor was “to graduate the exercises carefully to the
taste and comprehension of those for whom the Work is designed;
and this without falling below a just literary standard.”

In 1871 a series of ﬁve New American Readers under the
joint authorship of Epes Sargent and Amasa May was published.
Apparently Sargent’s name was retained for prestige, but May
did the work. These were very attractive both from the stand-
point of the print and the profuse use of pictures. Even the
Fourth and Fifth had pictures, which was unusual for upper
readers. They claimed that the series was carefully graded, hand-
somely illustrated, clearly printed, strongly bound, and that
they combined “all the advantages of the Word method, the
Phonic System, the A B C Method, and Object—Teaching.”
These comments clearly indicate that the authors were very con-
scious of different methods of teaching reading. Finally, in 1872,
these authors Wrote the Etymological Reader. The peculiar
feature of this book was that it presented long lists of prefixes,

92 OLD TEXTBOOKS

suﬂixes, Saxon roots, Latin roots, and Greek roots together
with their meanings. Then at the end of the regular reading
selections there appeared “Select Etymologies” dealing with the
most difficult words of the lessons.

G. S. Hillard (1808-1879). Hillard, like Sargent and several
others, wrote an advanced reader first. In 1855 he wrote A First
Class Reader, with “biographical and critical notices of the
authors.” Contrary to many other advanced readers, he claimed
this to be “exclusively a reading book. Pieces suitable for decla-
mation have been inserted only incidentally and occasionally.” In
fact it was really an anthology of literary pieces rather than a
Speaker. The next year A Second Class Reader appeared. How-
ever, it was a smaller and simpler book than the First. In 1857
appeared the Third Class Reader, and in 1858 the Third
Primary Reader. These readers were really numbered in reverse.
The higher numbered books were the lower. The Third Primary
greatly emphasized enunciation. T

Apparently Hillard’s emphasis upon literary silent reading
rather than on the rhetorical was too revolutionary for the
period; so in 1863 he published the Fifth Reader to replace the
Second Class Reader. In it he devoted 60 pages to letter sound
exercises and elocution. The regular reading lessons were pre-
ceded by brief biographical sketches of the authors, and followed
with key words defined. The Sixth Reader replaced the First
Class Reader. “An Introductory Treatise on Elocution” by
Professor Mark Bailey was included. The reading selections were
classiﬁed under Didactic, Narrative and Descriptive, Humorous
and Pathetic, Declamatory, and Dramatic. Rather long bio-
graphical notes preceded the lessons. These two books appeared
in many editions.

Ultimately Hillard must have realized that the demand for
books stressing elocutionary reading was still strong, so he pre-
pared an entirely new series along these lines and called them
the Franklin Series. It began with the Franklin Primer or First
Reader, and ended with the Franklin Sixth Reader and Speaker.
In several of these he even included pictures of persons speaking
orally, showing the varied positions or gestures of the hand,

READERS 93

head, and feet for different expressions of feelings and emphases.
In other words, the emphasis in the last series was nearly op-
posite to the ﬁrst. His experiment with literary silent reading
did not succeed.

Lucius Osgood. In 1855 Osgood began publishing the Progressive
Series of readers, which began with the Primer and ended with
the Fifth in 1858. These constituted the most popular series of
textbooks ever published in Pittsburgh. After building up a basic
vocabulary in the Primer, the lessons in the First Reader began
by adding new words to those already learned. Each lesson was
preceded by a picture and the new Words which had not been
learned. These words were to be pronounced and spelled, and
no doubt, their meanings given by the teacher.

The Second Reader began with tables of letter sounds and
their markings. Arabic numerals were placed above the vowels to
indicate their sounds, as had been done in the McGuﬂ"ey Speller.
Again lessons were preceded by marked word lists, and some had
pictures.’ The Third Reader began with twelve pages devoted
to “Elementary Principles”
(of elocution). It contained
combinations of vocals, sub-
vocals, and aspirates, as

1 2 1 1
bla, bro; glo, gru.

Then rather long marked
word lists preceded the read-
ing lessons. Beginning on
page 45 the words were also
defined. Most lessons were fol-
lowed by questions concerning
the facts or thoughts involved.
Many of the lessons attempted
to teach morals.

Osgood’sc Primer, first of most
popular series printed in Pitts-
burgh, 1855-1858, and later.

94 OLD TEXTBOOKS

In the Fourth Reader Osgood went all out in stressing elocu-
tionary reading. The first 140 pages dealt with matters of articu-
lation, accent, emphasis, inﬂection, and modulation, interspersed
with reading exercises involving them. These were followed by
244 pages of reading selections. The selections were preceded
by a list of words to be spelled and defined, and were followed
by many questions concerning their content. One half of the
lessons were either poetry or dialogues. The Fifth Reader had
4.8 pages dealing with elocution, not as many as in the Fourth,
but the treatment was much more technical.-Most of the regular
lessons were presented without word lists and without questions
following them. More of the lessons were extracts from classical
writings.

By 1870 Osgood evidently learned that there were certain
ob ections to his Progressive Readers, so he wrote the new Ameri-
can Series. The Primer and First Reader were published in 1870,
the Second and Third in 1871, the Fourth and Fifth in 187%, and
the Sixth in 1873. These represented considerable improvement
over the Progressive Series. The lower readers were very attrac-
tive, with larger print and profuse use of interesting pictures.
Furthermore, the first three changed from the numeral markings
of vowels to the use of diacritical marks.

The Fourth Reader was published in two forms, one using the
numeral marking of vowels and containing only 2924: pages, the
other using diacritical marks and containing 258 pages with
thirteen additional lessons. Likewise, the Fifth was printed in
two forms, one containing 109 lessons, the other, 225. The smaller
one contained many pictures; the larger had none. The Sixth
appeared only in one form of 512 pages. It contained a number
of pictures, which was uncommon for sixth readers. Apparently
these readers were more widely used in the western Pennsylvania
area than either the McGufi'ey or Sanders’ Readers.

Lewis B. Monroe (1825-1879). Beginning in 1871 Monroe pre-
pared a full graded series of six readers, and in 1877 a primer.
The lower readers were printed in rather large type and pro-
fusely illustrated with pictures, mostly of children and animals.
The upper readers had a few pictures. Monroe had been con-

READERS 95

nected with several types of schools in New England and
ultimately taught elocution in Boston University. The latter ex-
perience would naturally make him stress the sounds of letters
and their combinations. so beginning with the Primer he pre-
sented words, often illustrated, according to the sounds of the
vowels in them. For example, the first lesson in the Primer in-
cluded a note to the teacher that the words contained the sounds
of m, n, and short a. In the First Reader the notes about the
letter sounds appeared at the bottom of the page. The Second
and Third Readers did not play up the letter sounds so fully.
However, the Fourth Reader used 15 pages to present pictures
showing facial positions when pronouncing the different letter
sounds. The ﬁrst one is a crosscut picture of a head showing the

windpipe, vocal cords, pharynx, soft palate, tongue, teeth, and.

lips. The later pictures appeared in pairs of a crosscut and a
facial expression in pronouncing the various sounds. These were
the first pictures of this type in any popular readers up to that
time. The Fifth Reader used 31 introductory pages to deal with
articulation and gesturing. A number of pictures illustrated
different kinds of gestures. However, none of the lower ﬁve
readers used the term elocution, but the Sixth Reader devoted
446 pages to “Practical Elocution.” The terms in connection with
elocution were not as diﬂicultand technical, however, as was
true of many earlier upper readers.

Interestingly, in his “Hints to Teachers Monroe warned
against beginning “by teaching the alphabet.” The children
should be taught “the letters only as fast as they make use of
them.” The way to acquire the language is through the ear. In

99

none of the readers did he stress reading merely to get ideas from
the printed page, but rather to get the ideas of the words in the
sentences so that they could be effectively read orally with the
proper tone of voice, articulation, stress, and gesturing.

Most of the books in the Monroe Series were revised and en-
larged at least once and all of them went through several
printings. Apparently they were widely used during 18'70’s and
1880’s.

William T. Harris (1885—1908), Andrew J. Rickoff, and Mark

96 OLD TEXTBOOKS

Bailey. These three men were the authors of the well-known
Appleton School Readers. The First and Third were ﬁrst pub-
lislied in 1877 and the other three in 1878. No doubt, one very
evident reason for the immediate success of these Readers was
their authorship. All three men were Well—known educators at the
time. Bailey was an Instructor of Elocution at Yale, and Rickoff
was Superintendent of Instruction at Cleveland. At the time of
the publication of these books Harris was the very successful
Superintendent of Schools of St. Louis (1867-1880).

Harris became even more famous during the following years.
Several biographies have been written about him. While he was
an educational administrator he became very much interested in
philosophy. In 1867 he founded the Journal of Speculative
Philosophy. After leaving St. Louis he helped found the Concord
(Mass.) School of Philosophy and Literature. In 1889 he was
appointed United States Commissioner of Education, which posi-
tion he filled with distinction for seventeen years. One book about
him is called Yankee Teacher; The Life of William T. Harris.
Counting all of the separate titles of his Writings, books, articles,
various annual and other reports, etc., the total reached 479. He
was one of the outstanding educators of America in his time.

These Readers were very Well planned and attractively printed.
In the Preface of the First Reader it was suggested, “The teacher
using this book can teach by
any method which he may pre-
fer; but the experience of
many years has convinced us
that a judicious combination
of the Word and phonic meth-
ods is the best.” It contained
very interesting and instruc-
tive pictures in connection
with the “beautiful and child-
life reading lessons.”

The Second Reader con-

Ap-pleton, 1878 , sight reading.

READERS 97

tinued the plan of the First, but added a table of vowel and con-
sonant sounds. Of course the lessons were longer. Word lists
diacritically marked preceded the lessons, and many pictures
were included. The Third continued the plan of the others with
lessons, “How We Read,” placed at intervals through the book.
This was Professor Bailey’s way of introducing elocution.

Originally there were only ﬁve readers in the series, but ap-
parently the Fourth was found to be too difficult to follow im-
mediately after the Third, so the Introductory Fourth Reader
was prepared. In the Fourth the “domain of literature proper”
was introduced from standard writers representing “English un-
deﬁled” in their best style. “Preparatory Notes” were appended
to the lessons to aid both teacher and pupil. The elocutionary
work of the Third was continued in the Fourth.

The Fifth (and last) presented extracts from the world’s
greatest writers. The authors of the readers claimed it to be “a
textbook of belles—lettres, as Well as of reading and spelling.” The
“Preparatory Notes” were more advanced, and the lessons in
elocution fuller. Literary history and criticism were woven into
the lessons so as to evoke thought and inquiry in the minds of
pupils. Like in the Third and the Fourth a collection of “Unusual
and Diﬂicult Words” was presented at the end of the book.

These Readers apparently had wide circulation for at least
ten years, for most of them had new annual printings for many
of these years. For example, the writer’s collection contains seven
Fourth Readers each bearing a different date of printing, even
though the content was unchanged. The later editions of the
first four books contained advertising in the back of the books. In
fact, the changes in the advertising were the only pages that
were different in the earliest editions of 1877 and 1878 and the
editions printed as late as 1889.

William Swinton (1833-1892). Swinton, whose contributions as
the author of textbooks in the ﬁelds of spelling and grammar
are discussed in this book, was also the author of a series of
readers. In 1882-1883 he wrote the Primer, and ﬁve readers.
Then in 1885 he wrote the Sixth or Classic English Reader, and
in 1886 an Advanced Fourth Reader. He wrote these readers at

98 OLD TEXTBOOKS

a time when authors were apparently very sensitive about meth-
ods of teaching reading. He, like several other authors of that
period, tried to combine several methods. In the Preface of the
Primer he mentioned that the “Word method is used alone where
it serves best, the phonic method is used alonewhere it serves
best, and at a later stage the two are combined.” Pictures were
used in all except the Sixth Reader. Script was considerably
used in the Primer, and in the First and Second Readers. He
justified this by saying that most teachers commonly teach Words
and sentences by writing them on the blackboard. In the First
Reader Words were diacritically marked and a picture preceded
each lesson. On page 109 the colors are taught by means of colored
rectangles. This was one of the earliest examples of the actual
use of color in a textbook. The Second Reader began with several
lessons dealing with the sounds of vowels and consonants. Other-
wise it was merely -an advance over the First.

In the Third Reader a new feature was introduced. Since at
the top of the title page of all the readers there appeared a
heading entitled, “The Reader the Focus of Language—Train-
ing,” so in the Third he injected practice exercises correlating
reading and language lessons. These were partly oral and partly
Written. Some sort of language lesson preceded each reading
lesson. The Third ended with ﬁve pages devoted to word—analysis
of the principal English derivatives of the words of the book. The
Fourth Was similar to the Third, but considerably larger and con-
tained more selections Written by well—known Writers.

The Fifth Reader was two-thirds a reader and one-third a
speaker. Most ﬁfth readers Written before this were generally
solely speakers. Swinton ap-
parently believed that getting
thought from the printed
page was more important than
mere elocution. His emphasis
on connecting language study

Learning Words three ways, by
print, script, and picture.

READERS 99

with reading continued. At the end of the book 18 pages were
devoted to an analysis of Latin derivatives.

The Sixth or English Classic Reader was different than the
others. In it the emphasis was on literature. He presented
brief biographies and then several selections of ten British and
ten American famous authors: Shakespeare, Milton, Addison,
Pope, Franklin, Burke, Scott, Webster, Irving, Byron, Bryant,
Macaulay, Emerson, Longfellow, Whittier, Poe, Holmes, Ten-
nyson, Thackeray, and Lowell. A glossary was included at the
end of the book.

Although Swinton’s Readers were attractive, and unusual in
several respects, they were not reprinted as often as several other
series. It may be that the new features were too different and
revolutionary to receive common acceptance.

Ellen M. Cyr. She was one of a few women who authored a suc-
cessful series of readers before 1900, the end date for this work.
In 1891 she published The Children’s Primer. She aimed to have
children learn to throw “expression into sentences.” So she at-
tempted to provide a functional vocabulary of simple words.
Action pictures accompanied the lessons. The pictures in the
beginning often occupied more than half the page. The print
was large. A list of the words used in the Primer appeared at
the end of the book. The First Reader, published in 1892, in a
slightly advanced manner, continued the same approach, with
the word list at the end much longer.

Book Two consisted largely of many short stories, simple, and
in touch with daily life. For example, the first ﬁve stories were:
“Jessie and the Gander,” “Playing with the Sand,” “One Little
Duck,” “Something to Guess,” and “Charlie and the Cars.” The
end word list was longer. In Book Three she introduced con-
siderable poetry. In justification, she said, “If ‘Heaven lies about
us in our infancy,’ the realm of poetry cannot be far distant.” In
this volume she presented numerous poems of Whittier and
Lowell. Pictures of these authors and of their homes illustrated
the poems. Twelve pages of words used in the book were listed
at the end.

100 OLD TEXTBOOKS

The plan of Book Fonr was similar to Book Three, but the
poems were by Emily Dickinson, Holmes, and Bryant. Prose
lessons by Louisa M. Alcott, Felicia Hemans, Abby Diaz, Harriet
Beecher Stowe, Celia Thaxter, Fanny Fern, Lucy Larcom, and
Elizabeth S. Phelps also appeared. It will be noted that Ellen
Cyr included the writings of many women. In contrast, in the
Fifth Reader, written much later (1899), the authors of nearly
all the selections were men. Among them were Wordsworth,
Thoreau, Poe, Coleridge, Emerson, Goldsmith, Macaulay, Ten-
nyson, Burns, Cervantes, Carlyle, Kipling, Scott, Milton, Shakes-
peare, and Johnson. Pictures of many of these writers illustrated
the extracts of their writings.

In Book Sim (1898) the practice of presenting extracts from
the great writers of literature continued. Strangely, Book Sign
is 200 pages smaller than the Fifth. In 1899 Book Seven and
Book Eight were published. They followed the pattern of Book
Six, both in small size and in the type of literary selections. In-
cidentally, Miss Cyr’s series was the ﬁrst discussed in this work to
have eight readers.

In summary of Miss Cyr’s books, it can be said that in several
ways they were different. She began treatment of famous writers
lower in the series; she included the writings of more women;
after Book Two she leaned toward the pure literary rather than
lessons on nature study, games, life activities, and so on; and
she paid little attention to elocution. Her books went through
numerous printings.

James Baldwin. In 1897 a series of readers by Baldwin was pub-
lished. The series took two forms of combination; namely, read-
ers for First Year, Second Year, Third Year, Fourth and Fifth
Years Combined, and Sixth and Seventh Years Combined, and
separately books for Sixth Year, Seventh Year, and Eighth
Year. Apparently the combined readers were to be used in rural
schools, where it was the common practice to combine grades.

The First Year book was the first one of all the series discussed
to contain many colored pictures. Likewise it was one of the first
to begin with the sentence method. For example, the ﬁrst lesson
had a picture of a ball, beside which was the sentence, “This is

READERS 101

a ball,” both in script and Roman lettering. It was attractively
printed.

Pictures or portraits appeared in all the readers. However, in
contrast to Miss Cyr’s readers, lessons dealing with birds and
animal life were common. Of course, the upper readers, as in
most series, contained mostly extracts of well-known writers. No
treatment of elocution was included.

LESS POPULAR READERS

The writer’s collection contains readers written by 179 diﬁ'er—
ent authors. The readers of only 23 of these have been discussed
at any length. The readers of many other authors also went
through two or more editions. In this section mere mention will
be made of some of these.

Other Early Readers. Among the readers that were more or less
popular before it was common for them to appear in series were
the following: Daniel Adams’ The Understanding Reader; or
Knowledge before Oratory, Being a New Selection of Lessons
(1803); John Walker’s Elements of Elocution (1810); T. W.
Strong’s The Common Reader (1818); Joshua Leavitt’s Easy
Lessons in Reading (1823); Samuel Putnam’s The Analytical
Reader (1826) ; Mrs. Barbauld and Edgeworth’s American
Popular Lessons (1829); and Moses Severance’s American
Manual or English Reader (1830). Most of these were written
primarily for training upper classes in elocution. All of these
went through several printings.

The Less Popular Series of Readers. One of the earliest graded
series written in the United States was the New York Reader
(1817), which appeared as No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3. Beginning
in 1831 Oliver Angel wrote The Union reading series as N o. I,
No. II, No. III, No. IV, No. V, and No. VI. In the 1840’s

' William Russell wrote several readers for the lower grades en-

titled, The Primary Reader, Introduction to the Primary Reader,
and Sequelto the Primary Reader. Beginning in 1857 E. A.
Sheldon began publishing readers under difterent titles which

102 OLD TEXTBOOKS

continued to appear for more than twenty years. In the 1860’s
Richard Edwards wrote the Analytical Reader series in six forms.
In 1870 Noble Butler began publishing readers later known as
the Butler Series. Later in the 1870’s Sadlier’s ﬁve Excelsior
Readers were printed both in New York and Montreal. Beginning
in 1878 Albert N. Raub published a series of ﬁve Normal
Readers. In 1882 H. I. Gourley and J. N. Hunt published a
series of Modern Readers. Charles Barnes wrote the N ew National
Readers in 1883. In 1886 Loomis J. Campbell wrote a series of
ﬁve New Franklin Readers. In 1888 the H arper’s Readers, and
also the Normal Course in Reading series by Emma Todd and
William Powell appeared. In 1889 the Synthetic Readers by Mrs.
Rebecca S. Pollard were published. All these series appeared in
more than one printing.

CHARACTERISTICS OF AMERICAN READERS

Titles. A rather large fraction of the authors of American readers
used some descriptive or deﬁnitive term in connection with the
titles. Some of the terms were used by several series, such as
National or Progressive. The following list represents some
of the definitive terms: Monitorial, Understanding, Standard,
American, American Educational, Child’s, Progressive, Select,
Historical, Phonetic, Scholar’s, National, Popular, English,
Orator, Preceptor, Pictorial, Grammatical, Excelsior, Illustrated,
Geographical, Comprehensive, Juvenile, North American, Evan-
gelical, Analytical, Questional, First Class, Exhibition Speaker,
Common—School, Modern, Art—Literature, Classical, Graded-
School, Ladies’, Dramatic, Anglo—Saxon, Child’s Guide, Eclectic,
Wide—Awake, Young Gentleman’s, Cathedral, Synthetic, Rhe-
torical, Normal, Practical, New School, Etymological, Modern,
District School, Introductory, Gradual, Rational, Independent,
l\Iodel, Explanatory, and Elegant.

Readers in Series. The idea of producing readers in a graded
series was slow in developing. Although both Webster and Bing-
ham rather early wrote more than one reader, neither of them
graded their books. In a sense, the Murray Readers ultimately

READERS 103

were graded. Apparently, however, he did not have grading in
mind when he ﬁrst wrote the English Reader in 1799. He later
wrote a Sequel, which was more diﬂicult, and an Introduction as
an easier one. All were too diﬂicult for the lower grades. The two
earliest series really were the N ew York Reader, N o. 1, N o. 2, and
No. 3; and Cobb’s Juvenile Reader, No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 in
1830. Later he wrote a Sequel as a fourth reader. Several other
famous series began with only four readers; namely, those by
VVorcest.er, McGuffey, and Goodrich. To the latter two, higher
books were later added.

It is really puzzling why so many series consisted of ﬁve
readers. Among them were those written by Swan, Tower, Mande-
ville, Sargent, Harris, and Osgood (Progressive series). Although
all schools were not well graded at that time, particularly the
rural schools, certainly some cities had eight elementary grades.
So a plausible explanation may be that each of the ﬁrst four
readers would be used in two grades. During the ﬁrst the pupils
would be introduced to the contents of the reader and during the
second year would virtually commit much of it. Thus the first
four readers would be studied for eight years. Then the ﬁfth
reader, usually an elocutionary reader, was used in the academies
and high schools or as a supplementary reader in the upper
grades.

On the other hand, even more series contained six readers.
Among these were those written by Goodrich, Sanders, Tower
(later), Parker, Hillard, Osgood (American series), Monroe,
Swinton, and eventually McGruffey.

No series contained eight until in the 1890’s, when the Cyr
and the Baldwin books appeared.

Oral Emphasis. Beginning with Webster’s ﬁrst book and until the
1890’smost readers were written with the aim to develop effective
oral reading. In many instances the emphasis would begin in the
form of phonics in the lower readers by providing exercises on
letter and syllable sounds. This was particularly true in books by
Tower, Swan, and Monroe. Then commonly in the third or fourth
reader the books would begin with rules and principles of elocu-
tion. Many ﬁfth and sixth readers devoted from $0 to 60 pages to

104 OLD TEXTBOOKS

such rules and exercises. One of the first authors to pay attention
also to get meaning from the printed page was Town in his Third
Reader (1848). The lessons in this book were followed by ques-

tions regarding the information or thoughts involved. Later the  

readers by Hillard, Swinton, Cyr, and Baldwin did likewise. In
fact, the Cyr and the Baldwin Readers in the 1890’s omitted
serious treatment of the principles of elocution.

Literary Readers. As soon as readers began to appear in series
the upper readers commonly contained literary extracts from
famous authors. The upper readers by McGuffey were famous for
this. Since only a small fraction of the pupils would attend an
academy or a high school, the chief means for most pupils to
learn at least a little about the great writers of the past was
through the upper readers. As early as 1856 Mandeville in his
Fifth Reader included brief biographies about the authors of
many of the selections. Thus the pupils were really studying
literature. Other authors to follow this practice, some even pre-
senting photographs of them, were Parker and Watson, Hillard,
Swinton, and Cyr.

Script. Mandeville and Swinton presented the alphabet and some
of the earlier lessons in the lower readers both in script and
Roman type. Since most teachers used the blackboard freely it
was thought wise to have the children learn to read script from
the beginning.

Pictures. Except for the very earliest readers, it was common to
use pictures in the first and second readers. It was not until after
1850 that the fourth and even later the ﬁfth and sixth readers
contained pictures. Only Baldwin (1897) used colored pictures,

A and then only in the First Year Reader.

Sensitivity to Methods. In general, the compilers of readers for
a long time were not very conscious or sensitive to how reading
should be taught, except their emphasis on teaching elocution.
Without doubt, the publication of graded series of readers natu-
rally made compilers more conscious of approaches in teaching,

READERS 105

especially in compiling the primary readers. Possibly, Tower’s
emphasis on phonics in 18451 in his Gradual Reader caused other
authors to consider the merits and demerits of the diﬁ"erent
methods. This was reﬂected in the preface of Sargent’s First
Standard Reader (1855), when he endeavored “to graduate the
exercises” to the taste and comprehension of the children. Sub-
sequently, statements in the prefaces of the readers by Harris,
Swinton, Baldwin, and others, all reﬂected the keen attention
given to the most effective methods of teaching reading. It may
Well be added that these discussions continue to the present.

GRAMMARS

GRAMMARS FROM ENGLAND

APPARENTLY English grammar was taught in very few colonial
schools before 1750. In the colonial period the word “Eng-
lish” needed to be used in connection with grammar, for both in
England and in early colonial America the word “grammar”
was most commonly associated with the study of Latin and Greek.
It was in America, where soon the vernacular received greater
emphasis, that the study of English grammar was to receive
marked attention. A

According to Lyman’s1 scholarly study very few public schools
in America taught English grammar before 1775. However, it
was taught in a considerable number of private schools earlier.
According to a newspaper advertisement a William Waterman
taught the “Rudiments of Grammar” in the Wassamacaw School
in South Carolina in 17 34.4. In 17 43 Charles Fortesque announced
the teaching of “English in a grammatical manner” in Chester,
Pennsylvania. After 1750 many private schools began teaching
grammar. This was not so true in New England as in the middle
colonies. Lyman could ﬁnd only six references before 1775 to

schools in all New England as teaching English grammar. On
the other hand, at least thirty—nine schools in New York, New
Jersey, and Pennsylvania were doing so. In fact, there were at
least eight schools in Philadelphia alone teaching it before 1760.
No doubt, the emphasis given it by Benjamin Franklin in his
Academy, beginning in 17 50, greatly hastened this development.

A word should be said about the nature of those early schools.
Only in New England were public schools found in the colonial
period. The mass of the children attended only the Reading and
Writing school, where the emphasis was to learn to read, so that
all could read the Bible, religious books, and the laws. A few
of the abler boys attended the Latin grammar schools. There
seemed no need for English grammar for the masses. In the other
colonies there were no public schools, and so many private
schools arose. Since the maintenance of private schools greatly
depended upon the tuition of the students, necessarily the schools
would teach the subjects most useful to the students. English
grammar soon began to be considered a useful subject. In other
words, theneed was felt to write “grammatically,” as well as to
read. The private schools, however, were generally more secondary
in nature than elementary, though very few were strictly graded.
Not only did English grammar become popular in secondary
schools, but also in certain colleges. No doubt, the reason gram-
mar was given in the colleges was to make up for the language
deﬁciencies of the students who had not attended a Latin gram-
mar school.

Consideration must be given the materials for the study of
English grammar in America. As was true of the textbooks in
other ﬁelds, the earliest were brought from England, and then
soon some were reprinted here. There were no copyright laws
then to prevent this practice. Lyman lists evidence that at least
twelve grammatical texts first written or published in England
were brought or reprinted here before 1784, when Webst.er’s
Grammar was ﬁrst published. Even others may have been brought
over. Advertisements in various colonial newspapers announced
sale of “Spelling Books by the dozen,” “English Grammars,” etc.

The earliest mentioned by Lyman was James Greenwood’s An
Essay Towards a Practical English Grammar published in

108 OLD TEXTBOOKS

London in 1711. A later edition was brought here. However, at
least one copy of the older book was brought here, for the writer
has a copy of it. This was Humphry Hody’s The Royal Grammar
Reformed into a More Easie Method, for the Better Understand-
ing of the English: and More Speedy Attainment of the Latin
Tongue, published in London in 1694. The ﬁrst part of the
book is English grammar, and later in the book there is a chapter
entitled “Prosodia,” which also deals with an aspect of grammar.

At least three other grammars not mentioned by Lyman were
brought here. The earliest one was A Short Introduction to
Grammar by S. Buckley and J. Osburn, printed in London in
1783. Apparently copies of it were brought here, for the writer
has two different editions of it, used here. The other two not
mentioned were even reprinted here; namely, James Buchanan’s
A Regular English Syntax printed in Philadelphia in 1780, and
Thomas Sheridan’s A Rhetorical Grammar of the English Gram-
mar, Philadelphia, 1783. Both of these books were larger than
most early grammars.

The second one listed by Lyman was Thomas Dilworth’s N ew
Guide to the English Tongue
in 1740. This gained the wid-
est usage in America of all the
English published books dur-
ing the colonial period. This
was reprinted in America in
1747, and thereafter reprinted
by many different American
printers. Likely a reason why
it became so popular was be-
cause it was a combination of
speller, reader, grammar, and
literature. Thus it served the
purposes of several textbooks.

printed copies in the Writer’s collection, the oldest copy devoted
40 pages to grammar, the next oldest 20 pages, and the latest
no grammar, even though the table of contents listed grammar
as part of the book.  

A third book listed was written by James Harris in 1751,
entitled, Hermes, or a Philosophical Inquiry Concerning Gram-
mar, which was reprinted in Philadelphia, reaching its seventh
edition in 1825.

The first one to be more strictly only a grammar was Robert
LoWth’s A Short I ntrodnction to English Grammar in 1758. This
text was used at Harvard for several decades. Lowth’s rules were
later copied by other authors. Another English book used here
was The British Grammar, anonymous, London, 1760. Two more
were printed in London in 1763; namely, Ash’s Grammatical
Institutes, and Fisher’s Practical New Grammar, which reached
its twenty—eighth edition here by 1795.

The grammar originally written in England to attain widest
usage and to exert most inﬂuence here was Lindley Murray’s
English Grammar, ﬁrst published in York, England in 1795.
Murray was born and edu-
cated in America but later
moved to England, where he
wrote his popular texts in the
fields of spelling, reading, and
grammar. An Abridgement of
Murray/’s English Grammar
was printed in Philadelphia in
1797 containing 108 pages. In
all, the Nietz Collection con-
tains twenty—four different
l\Iurray Grammars published
by sixteen diﬁcerent American
printers dating from 1797 to
1870. Too, these vary greatly
in size. The smallest book,

110 OLD TEXTBOOKS

containing 72 pages was printed in Boston in 1816, and the
largest was printed in New York in 1819, containing 37 6 pages
of grammar (Vol. I) ; 298 pages served as a “Key to the Exer-
cises” (Vol. II), and appeared as one book bound in ﬁne leather.
The smallest books were usually entitled Abrédgements. The
others usually contained from 250 to 325 pages. Apparently each
printer decided what to include and what to omit. The “Table
of Contents” of most of them was somewhat as follows:

Part I——Orthography Part II-—-—Etymology
Chapter, 1. _Of letters . (This pa.rt contained nine chapters)
Chapter 2. Of syllables Part III——Syntax
Chapter 3. Of words Part IV——-Prosody
APPENDIX

Rules and observations for promoting perspicuity and accuracy in writing

Part I——Perspicuity and accuracy of expression, with respect to
single words and phrases.

Part II—-Perspicuity and accuracy of expression, with respect to
the construction of sentences.

Further references will be made concerning the inﬂuence of
l\Jurray’s grammars when dealing with the American written
grammars. Murray has been referred to as the “father of
English Grammar.”

CONTENT OF AMERICAN GRAMMARS

There is a common belief that grammars have changed Very
little through the years. It is true that they have changed less
than the textbooks in most other subjectxﬁelds, but there have
been changes. A detailed analysis of the 76 most commonly used
American grammars before 1850 was made by Huston.2 Several
of the earliest popular grammars were actually written in

2Jon Huston, “An Analysis of English Grammar Textbooks Used in American
Schools Before 1850.” (Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Pitts-
burgh, 1954).

GRAMMARS 111

England, but republished in America. Naturally thus they would
also greatly inﬂuence the earliest American Written grammars
as to content and approach. Of these the one that had widest
and longest usage here was Lindley Murray’s English Grammar,
which set a pattern for American grammars. It was divided into
four parts, plus an appendix, as follows: Part I, Orthography;
Part II, Etymology; Part III, Syntax; Part IV, Prosody; and
Appendix, Perspicuity. Thereafter many authors of grammars
included these same four parts, so that their inclusion became
somewhat traditional. However, a number of authors courageously
departed from this traditional practice. Table IV, which is based
on Huston’s ﬁndings, shows how many of the '76 grammars con-
tained each of the four parts by periods, and the average per
cent of space devoted to each. It should be noted that one—third
of the books failed to include orthography and prosody, but that
more than 80 per cent contained separate parts for etymology
and syntax. Others combined etymology and syntax.

Orthography. Murray said, “Orth-ography teaches the nature and
powers of letters, and the just method of spelling words.” Goold
Brown said, “Orthography treats of letters, syllables, separate
words, and spelling.” Since words are composed of letters, and
sentences composed of words, most authors apparently thought
it logical to begin with the treatment of letters, which is orthog-
raphy. However, one—third of the books omitted it, and only
one—eighth of the average space dealt with it.

Etymology. Murray said that etymology “treats of the different
sorts of words, their various modiﬁcations, and their derivation.”
Brown said that it “treats of the diﬁierent parts of speech, and
their classes and modifications.” These deﬁnitions show that what
we today commonly call grammar was etymology. However, the
parts of speech included in many of the early grammars were
not termed the same as the eight now commonly recognized;
namely, noun, pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition,
interjection, and conjunction. Murray mentioned the article
instead of the adjective, and the substantive instead of the noun.
Too, many used the participle as a part of speech.

GRAMMARS 113

Since etymology dealt with the classiﬁcation of words, the bulk
of its content related to the parts of speech and parsing. With
each part of speech were its various modiﬁcations and sub-
divisions. The process of pointing out these modiﬁcations or sub—
classes was parsing. Harvey said that “parsing consists (1) in
naming the part of speech; (2) in telling its properties;  in
pointing out its relation to other words; (4) in giving the rule
for its construction.” For example, when applied to a noun it
would analyze whether it was proper or common; singular or
plural; masculine, feminine, or neuter; and nominative, pos-
sessive, or objective case. Similar analyses would be applied to
words of other parts of speech. Some texts made much of parsing,
such as Barrett’s Principles of Language, others gave it little or
no attention.

Syntax‘. Brown deﬁned it as follows: “Syntax treats of the re-
lation, agreement, government, and arrangement, of words in
sentences.” In other words, it dealt with functions and relations
of words in sentences. A fully consistent grammar would not deal
separately with etymology and syntax. Huston found that four-
teen of the grammars did combine the treatment of etymology and
syntax. They then were considered the progressive and non-
traditional textbooks. Among the authors who did this before
1850 were Webster, Cobb, Ingersoll, Kirkham, Smith, Greene,
Hazen, and Weld. Their books will later be described. Only three
of the '76 grammars failed to deal with syntax, either as such or
in combination with etymology. One of these was Dilworth’s N ew
Guide to the English Tongue, which was a combination of speller,
reader, and grammar. The average number of rules of syntax per
book in all the '76 grammars was 21.

Prosody. Brown deﬁned it as the treatment of “punctuation, ut-
terance, ﬁgures, and versiﬁcation.” Murray presented it under
two parts: pronunciation, “comprising accent, quality, emphasis,
pause, and tone”; and the laws of versiﬁcation. Kirkham agreed
with Murray. Only two—thirds of the books dealt with this branch
of grammar, and most of them merely brieﬂy. Only 7 per cent
of the space in all the books related to prosody. It may be noted

114 OLD TEXTBOOKS

that Brown included punctuation under prosody, but most authors
dealt with punctuation either separately or with syntax.

EARLIEST AMERICAN GRAMMARS

Following the detailed analysis of the contents of American
grammars, it should be meaningful next to consider just whose
grammars were most popular and something of their general
characteristics by periods.  

The first grammar written in America was by Hugh Jones in
17 24:, but was sent to England for printing. The first one to be
both written and printed here was by Samuel Johnson, the first
president of King’s College, now Columbia University, in 1765;
it consisted only of 36 pages. Two other American grammars
appeared before Webster’s; namely, Thomas Byerley’s A Plain
and Easy Introduction to English Grammar, 1773; and Abel
Curtis’s A Compend of English Grammar: Being an Attempt to
Point Out the Fundamental Principles of the English Language,
1779, containing 448 pages.

Noah Webster’s was the
first grammar written here to
receive considerable accept-
ance. It was published in 1784
as Part II of A Grammatical
Institute of the English Lan-
guage, the S peller was Part I.
By 1787 a fourth edition ap-
peared. The deﬁnitive parts
of this grammer were in cate—
chetical form. For example:

What is Grammar?

Grammar is the art of com-
municating thoughts by words
with propriety and dispatch.

Webster’s Grammar, Part II of
Grammatical Institute; Speller
was Part I.

GRAMMARS 115

What is the use of English Grammar? ,
To teach the true principles and idioms of the English language.

Apparently Webster borrowed many of the definitions from
British grammars, especially from Lowth’s. In 1831 he published
a radically revised edition entitled, An Improved Grammar of
the English Language. It, too, appeared in several editions. The
catechetical form of presentation was abandoned. Webster’s
Grammars were not as systematically organized as those by
Murray.

Another early American grammar was The Young Lady’s
Accidence written by Caleb Bingham in 1785. The following
couplet appeared on the title page:

Delightful task! To rear the tender thought,
To teach the young idea how to shoot, -

The first edition was printed in 1797, and the twentieth in 1815.
These books contained only 60 pages. It is claimed that a hundred
thousand copies of them were sold. Although very small, they
dealt with all of the more important aspects of grammar, but
Very simply and brieﬂy. Although written primarily for girls,
the grammar was used by all children in Boston public schools,
and no doubt elsewhere.

After Webster’s Grammar was first published in 1784, the
number of grammar textbooks to appear in America increased
rapidly. According to Lyman’s study the appearance of these
textbooks was distributed by decades as follows: 1760-1770, 1;
1771-1780, 5; 1781-1790, 9; 1791-1800, 18; 1801-1810, 14;
1811-1820, 41; 1821-1830, 84; 1831-1840, 63; and 1841-1850,
66.

AMERICAN GRAMMARS: 1820-1840

The foregoing data show that more grammar textbooks were
first published in the 1820’s than in any decade for a century.
Too, three of these became Very popular, and more than a half
dozen others appeared in more than two editions; while none of
the 1830 books became popular. The three authors whose gram-

116 OLD TEXTBOOKS

mars of those decades to become most popular were Goold Brown,
Samuel Kirkham, and Roswell Smith. The books of these three
men virtually replaced the use of Webster’s grammars and
greatly reduced the use of Murray’s.

Goold Brown (1791-1857). His parents were Quakers. At ﬁrst
he engaged in mercantile Work, which he found repugnant. Then
he became a teacher in John Griscom’s well-known school in
New York. Later he was the principal of a private academy in
New York City. It was then that he began to Write the textbooks
that became so popular.

In 1823 Brown published both the Institutes of English
Grammar and the First Lines of English Grammar. The latter
was “A Brief Abstract of the Author’s Larger Work Designed
for Young Learners.” In a sense these two books constituted a
graded series even before grading textbooks was common. Both
texts continued to appear, with some revisions, for more than
ﬁfty years after the death of the author. Evidence indicates that
the First Lines became popular in common schools (elementary),
while the Institutes gained
very wide usage in academies.
For example, in 1850, in New
York State, Murray’s Gram-
mar was used in one, Kirk-
ham’s in 15, and Brown’s in
'72 academies.

But why did the Institutes
of English Grammar become
so popular? An examination
of it soon reveals certain char-
acteristics or merits of the
book. First, it was well and
clearly organized. Part I dealt
with Orthography; Part H,

Language, 1823——how orthog-
raphy was taught.

G R A M M A R S 117
Etymology; Part III, Syntax; and Part IV, Prosody. Then each

part was clearly sub—divided into sections. For example, there
was Prosody of Punctuation, of Utterance, and of Versiﬁcation.
Secondly, there was clarity. The deﬁnitions, rules, examples, and
questions were very clearly and simply stated. For example, the
very ﬁrst sentence in the body of the book states: “Grammar is
the art of speaking and writing the English language correctly.”
Thirdly, following the deﬁnitions were many examples and exer-
cises. Lastly, the printing was Well and attractively done, and
most of the earlier editions were bound in ﬁne leather.

There may be several reasons why Brown’s books were so Well
written. In the preface of the Institutes he stated, “For his own
information, he has carefully perused more than ﬁfty English
grammars, and has sought, . . . The analogies of speech, in the
structure of several languages.” Too, his teaching experience
provided him pedagogical insights regarding the presentation of
the material. After Brown’s death the publishing company em-
ployed Henry Kiddle to revise the Institutes, and thus its sale
continued for many decades.

Another contribution made by Goold Brown was to publish
The Grammar of Grammars in 1851, which appeared in several
editions. It contained 1,102 pages. It was one of the most ex-

haustive treatments of English grammar ever Written. It began .

by listing alphabetically the names of the authors of 4:63 gram-
mars which had been published by 1850. Then after an analytical
introduction of grammar, 750 pages were devoted to detailed
analyses of the four parts of grammar; namely, orthography,
etymology, syntax, and prosody. The remainder of the book pre-
sented a “Key to the Oral Exercises” of the foregoing four parts.
Thus it can be said that Groold Brown made a deﬁnite contribu-
tion to the development of textbooks as Well as to the teaching of
English grammar in the United States.

Kirlcham. In the same year (1823) that Brown’s Institutes was
ﬁrst published, another grammar was published, which too be-
came very popular: Samuel Kirkham’s A Compendium of Eng-
lish Grammar. It was a small book of 84: pages, and apparently
adapted well for use in the common schools. In 1825 Kirkham

enlarged the book and changed its title to English Grammar in
Familiar Lectures Accompanied by a Compendium. In 1829 he
enlarged it again (to 228 pages), with the title unchanged. Kirk-
ham’s Grammar was considerably more popular for more than a
decade than Brown’s Institutes. For example, in 184.0 Kirkham’s
was used in 61 New York academies, and Brown’s was used in
40. However, in 1850 Kirkham’s was used only in 15, but
Brown’s in 72. Kirkham’s book was even more popular in the
common schools. In 1888 his book was used in the schools of
4:27 towns in New York, but Brown’s in only sixty. Due largely,
no doubt, to its smaller size Kirkham’s book was better adapted
to the elementary level, while Brown’s larger book of roughly
300 pages later became more often used in academies. Too, Kirk-
ham’s popularity largely ceased in the 18450’s, but Brown’s con-
tinued somewhat throughout the nineteenth century.

The organization of Kirkham’s book was considerably different
from Brown’s. It was presented in the form of lectures rather
than parts. In a sense the material was in two parts rather than
the four which was common in most grammars. Orthography
came first, as was usual. Then
etymology and syntax were
combined, and prosody was
omitted entirely. This simpli-
ﬁcation evidently aided the
grammar’s beginning popu-
larity, particularly at the ele-
mentary level. However, later
a reaction set in against this
over-simplification. The 1829
edition had one feature which
the present writer has not
seen in any other earlier gram-
mar; namely, a large folded
page, 12 x 15 inches, six col-
umns, containing a compen-

GRAMMARS 121

dium of all important deﬁnitions and rules of grammar. There

Were 60 deﬁnitions of grammar, and 35 rules of syntax. This page
was folded opposite the title page.

Smith. The third author whose grammars became popular was
Roswell C. Smith. His first one was the Intellectual and Practical
Grammar, in a Series of Inductive Questions. Although the copy-
right date Was 1830, it contained a recommendation dated 1829.
As indicated by the sub-title, this book followed the inductive
rather than the deductive approach. In the preface the author
quotes Barnard’s Journal of Education (No. 38, p. 97) in

defense as follows:

Pestalozzi endeavored, in the first place, to ascertain, by questions
adapted to the tender age of the pupil, whether any idea existed in
the mind upon the subject to which he wished to direct his attention;
and from any one clear idea, of which he found the child in pos-
session, he led him on, by a series of questions, to the acquirement
of such other ideas as were most intimately connected with that
primary conception.

In other words, instead of hav-
ing the child first commit to
memory the definitions and
rules, and then apply them,
Smith attempted to develop
an understanding of the rules
and deﬁnitions by means of
leading questions. In all, this
book contained 122 pages, 41
lessons, and 30 rules. It went
through several editions.

In 1832 Smith published
his English Grammar on the
Productive System. Without
much further change this book

Smith’s Grammar, inductive in ap-
proach.

122 OLD TEXTBOOKS

was printed in numerous editions until the 1860’s. It was a thor-
ough revision of the Practical Grammar, particularly in regard to
the presentation of the material. For example, it began as follows:

I. Of the Noun
Q. What is a name?
Q. What is the name of the town in which you live?
Q. What does the word noun mean?
Answer. The word noun means name.

Thus he dealt with number, gender, proper and common nouns,
person, case, articles, adjectives, pronouns, verbs, tense, mood,
prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections. The plan really
was an inductive catechetical approach. Beginning on page 41
the remainder of the book dealt with all thesematters in a positive
form much like other grammars. In all, the book contained 1992
pages. In 1840 ,Smith’s Grammar was next to Kirkham’s in
popularity in New York academies, but greatly declined in use
by 1850. In New England towns it was by far the most popular
grammar in 1840. Like Kirkham’s Smith’s Grammar did not
remain popular over as extended a period as did Brown’s.

Less Popular Grammars. Many other grammars in addition to
those of Brown, Kirkham, and Smith first appeared in the 1820’s,
but apparently were not so widely accepted. However, a number
did appear in several editions. In 1821 A Self-Explaining Gram-
mar by Enos Cobb was published. This was a rather small
grammar which abandoned the old Four Part organization then
common. It followed a rather simple functional approach. How-
ever, its departure from the formal type of organization must
have been too radical for common acceptance.

Also in 1821 Charles M. Ingersoll published his Conversations
on English Grammar, which appeared in a number of editions.
This was a rather large book, which was presented in three
sections or parts: Conversation, which in part was in question
and answer form; Additional Remarks, which consisted of ma-
terial amplifying the earlier section; and Punctuation, which
dealt with deﬁnitions and rules, together with their application to
punctuation.

GRAMMARS 123

‘John Comly, whose Speller was very popular, published in
1826 an English Grammar, Made Easy to the Teacher and Pupil.
This small book was divided into a treatment of orthography,
etymology, syntax, and punctuation. He aimed “to abridge and
arrange the deﬁnitions and rules necessary to be committed to
memory, as not to burden the pupil.”

In 1826 Rufus Nutting published A Practical Grammar of
the English Language, which appeared in numerous reprintings
before it was revised and enlarged in 1840. It at first consisted of
four parts: Etymology, Syntax, Punctuation, and Prosody. The
deﬁnitions and rules were tersely and clearly stated. The revised
edition was considerably different. In Part I the simple elements
were presented inductively. Then in Part II orthography,
etymology, and syntax were presented much like other grammars.
In Part III exercises involving various aspects of grammar were
given. Somewhat like Kirkham’s Grammar a folded chart, with
printing on both sides, was included presenting a “Synoptical
View” of the aspects of grammar.

In 1828 John Frost published the Elements of English Gram-
mar: With Progressive Exercises in Parsing. It was a small book,
which he claimed to be an improvement of Lowth’s and Murray’s
Grammars. He claimed that the deﬁnitions were simpliﬁed, the
rules of syntax “given in clear and intelligible language,” and
the exercises “digested according to their syntactical form.”

Apparently no grammar that was ﬁrst published in the 1830’s
became very popular. Several, however, went through more than
one edition. First may be mentioned L. F. Hamlin’s English
Grammar in Lectures. The material was presented in 13 Lectures,
as follows: I, Of Orthography; II,‘ Of Etymology; III, Of the
Article; IV, Of the Adjective; V, Of the Pronoun; VI, Of the
Verb; VII, Of the Adverb; VIII, Of the Prepositi-on; IX, Of
the Conjunction; X, Of the Interjection; XI, Of Syntax; XII,
Of Criticism; and XIII, Of Prosody, Of Punctuation. It may be
noted that this organization was considerably different than in
most grammars.

The second one was The Principles of Language by Solomon
Barrett, first published in 1836. This book was unique in several
respects. The ﬁrst twelve’ pages dealt with the theory of the

124 OLD TEXTBOOKS

principles of language, and with syllogistic reasoning applied
to grammatical matters. The first contents page began as follows:

Universal Grammar is a science which treats of
Persons, Places, and Things, i.e. nouns and pronouns.

With their Qualities, i.e. art., adj., and part.
Existing and Acting, i.e. verbs, neu., and act.
Either Jointly or Severally i.e. sing., plur., and conj.
With the Manner of such i.e. adverbs, adverbial
existence and action phrases, and prep.

Then eleven pages presented the chiefdeﬁnitions and rules of
grammar. More than thirty pages were devoted to detailed pars-
ing of each word of numerous poetic selections. For example:

art a8 ncf8s adv v r n ind pr .33
“The midnight moon serenely smiles”

The latter part of the book dealt at length with the theory and
practice of language and syntax. Later Barrett published The

Principles of Grammar, which appeared in several editions, even
in the 1860’s.

GRAMMARS OF THE 1 81;0’S

The 1840’s, like the 1820’s, constituted a fruitful period for
the publication of grammars. At least seven authors published
grammars then which gained rather wide acceptance.

Bullions. The first of these authors was Peter Bullions. Although
he had published a grammar in the 1830’s, it really was a virtual
reprint of William Lennie’s The Principles of English Grammar,
published first in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1844: Bullions pub-
lished his Practical Lessons in English Grammar, which appeared
in several revised forms later, one of which was a smaller book for
“Beginners.” The 1853 edition, considerably enlarged, was en-
titled An Analytical and Practical Grammar. In 1857 he pub-
lished the Progressive Exercises in Analysis and Parsing, and in
1862 the Common School Grammar, which was to serve as an
introduction for the Analytical and Practical Grammar. It is

GRAMMARS 195

evident that Bullions, possibly more than any grammar author up
to that time, attempted to revise his books frequently, apparently
in response to the criticisms of his competitors. Goold Brown was
a severe critic of other grammars during that period. Neverthe-
less during the late 184s0’s, and throughout the 1850’s, Bullions’
books were next to Brown’s in popular usage in the academies of
New York, and also used in many common schools.

An examination of Bullions’ Grammars indicates that he con-
sciously attempted to pattern after the grammars of Lennie and
of Murray rather than those of Brown. He indicated, in his pref-
ace, that the chief criticism of Murray’s books was that the un-
abridged were too large and the abridged too small. Bullions’
earlier books were of average size. Later he wrote smaller books
as introductions for his larger works. In other words, he published
grammars in series. In organization he followed the traditional
pattern of four parts: Orthography, Etymology, Syntax, and
Prosody. Too, he gave considerable attention to parsing. As noted
above, he eventually published a separate book of parsing ex-
ercises. Bullions also wrote a number of Greek and Latin gram-
mars, which, no doubt, somewhat inﬂuenced the structure of his
English grammars.

Greene. The second author of note during the 184.<O’s was Samuel
S. Greene. In 1846 he published A Treatise of the Structure of
the English Language, which aimed at an “analysis and classifi-
cation of sentences and their component parts.” This book clearly
indicated a change in the approach to teaching grammar, from
the emphasis on memory, as favored by Murray and Brown, to
that of analysis. The organization of the book departed radically
from the traditional form. Chapter I dealt with the “Elements
of the First Class,” really words and their parts of speech.
Chapter II dealt with “Elements of the Second Class——Phrases.”
Chapters III, IV, and V dealt with sentences as the “Third
Class.” Then in the appendix the traditional divisions of orthog-
raphy, etymology, syntax, prosody, and punctuation were pre-
sented brieﬂy.

In 1848 Greene published his First Lessons in Grammar, which
was to serve as an introduction to the Treatise. It dealt with the

126 OLD TEXTBOOKS

derivation and composition of words, parts of speech, inflection,
simple sentences, complex sentences, compound sentences, and
prosody. In 1858 he published The Elements of English Gram-
mar. Apparently he realized that the earlier books represented
a too radical departure from the traditional for ready acceptance,
so he retreated somewhat in this book by trying to combine the

A newer approach with the older. For example, the sub—title stated

that it was “so arranged as to combine the analytical and syn-
thetical methods: with an introduction for beginners, and various
exercises, oral and written, for the formation, analysis, trans-
formation, classiﬁcation, and correction of sentences.” Then in
1856 his An Introduction to the Study of English Grammar ap-
peared. Its purpose was to be introductory to the Elements. In
1860 he published A Grammar of the English Language, a some-
what larger book than the Elements. In its preface he suggested
the serial order in which his grammars may be used, as follows:

I Introduction.
II The Grammar of the English Language.
’ III The Analysis of Sentences. I

From the foregoing it is evident that Greene, like Roswell
Smith earlier, attempted to abandon the old deductive and memo-
rization approach of teaching grammar. However, he soon sensed
that changes must come gradually, so his later books represented
a compromise in methods. Evidently this compromise resulted in
greater acceptanceiof his books, for they still had a wide usage

as late as the 1870’s.

Weld. A third author of the 1840’s whose books appeared in
numerous editions was Allen H. Weld. His first book was pub-
lished in 184.6, entitled English Grammar, “illustrated by ex-
ercises in composition, analyzing, and parsing.” In the preface
he acknowledged his debt to Webster, Murray, etc., and to Latin
and Greek grammars. This meant that he followed more fully
the traditional pattern both in method (deductive) and in con-
tent by presenting it in the four conventional parts. In 1847 he

published a small book entitled, Parsing Book. Apparently this ,

was to accompany some regular grammar book. Its popularity is

GRAMMARS . 127

attested by the fact that its 1853 edition was the ﬁftieth. In
1859 both of these books appeared in revised editions with the
word Progressive attached. He claimed to have removed certain
difficulties and clariﬁed certain parts. Too, they were somewhat
larger. His books met decreasing usage in the early 1860’s.

Wells. The fourth successful writer of this period was W. H.
Wells. He published A Grammar of the English Language in
1846. The 1866 edition stated that it was the 260,000th. The
later revised editions were somewhat enlarged. In the preface
he stated that he possessed more than 300 treatises on English
grammar, and then he listed more than 1925 grammars that he had
consulted in the preparation of his book. The text was organized
into the four traditional parts. He claimed that “grammar is too
often taughtas if it were merely the art of parsing. It is hoped
that instructors will ﬁnd the present work adapted to teach ‘the
art of speaking and writing.’ ” So before presenting the regular
grammar material his book devoted the ﬁrst Q4 pages to oral

, work, upon the suggestion of Henry Barnard, then the head of

the schools in Rhode Island.
Too, the grammar was pre-
sented very plainly so that it

could be more easily under-
stood.

Tower. The ﬁfth author, whose
grammar appeared in 18456,
was David B. Tower. His ﬁrst
was the Gradual Lessons in
Grammar; or, Guide to the
Construction of the English
Language. Previously, in
1841, he had published The
Gradual Reader. The title in-
dicated the nature of his ap-

of four parts of grammar.

proach and the purpose of grammar. In 1853 together with
B. F. Tweed he published the First Lessons in Language; or
Elements of English Grammar. This was a small book and very
different fromthe earlier one. Its parts were language; analysis,
or parsing; sentences, simple and compound; and rules. The ma-
terial was nearly all in question or inductive for'm. Since this
book was so different in approach from the Gradual Lessons, it
was necessary for him to prepare a new advanced book to follow
the Elements. So in 1859 he published the Common School Gram-
mar. However, it was not in question form. All of these books

‘Went through several editions.

Clark. The sixth author to be mentioned in this period was S. W.
Clark. In 1847 he published A8 Practical Grammar, and also a
Diagram System. In 1870 the latter was incorporated into The
Normal Grammar: Analytic and Synthetic. In 1851 the Analysis
of the English Language appeared. He also wrote a First Lesson
in English Grammar for beginners as an introduction to the
Practical Grammar.

In the preface of his ﬁrst book he said that in his teaching
experience in an academy he
had consulted many gram-
mars and then prepared man-
uscript materials from which
he taught his own classes.
After seven years of such ex-
perimentation he published
the Practical Grammar. It is
at least partly inductive, and
uses both the analytic and
synthetic approaches. Too,
Clark introduced many dia-
grams and included many ex-
ercises throughout the book.
This book of 218 pages was

diagramming.

GRAMMARS 129

enlarged to 305 pages and recopyrighted in 1855, and again in
1864. These books had wide usage during the decades of the
1850’s, ’60’s, and "70’s.

Pinneo. The last and seventh popular author whose first grammar
appeared in the 18<kO’s was T. S. Pinneo. His ﬁrst, in 1849, was
the Primary Grammar of the English Language. This was a
book of 110 pages written particularly for beginners. Except
in the recapitulation at the end of the book, the traditional four
parts of orthography, etymology, syntax, and prosody were not
even mentioned. It dealt simply with the various parts of speech
and their properties. It contained a mixture of questions, state-
ments or rules, and exercises. It contained 204 numbered sections
and 106 exercises. This book was revised and enlarged in 1854.

Pinneo’s second book, in 1850, was the Analytical Grammar.
Its approach was similar to the Primary Grammar, except that
it was nearly twice as large and much more analytical in its
treatment of the parts of speech. It, too, gave only meager atten-
tion to the traditional four parts of grammar.

His third book, in 1852, was the English Teacher. It paid
much less attention to formal grammar, but aimed to teach “the
structure of sentences by analysis and synthesis.” This departure
from formal grammar probably was more radical than was true
of any popular grammar of that period. However, this book did
not appear in as many editions as his other two grammars.

All these books were printed in Cincinnati by the same ﬁrm
that published the famous McGuffey Readers and the Ray’s
Arithmetics, and like them they had wide circulation in the mid-
west.

A number of other grammar textbooks first appeared in the
1840’s, but none in numerous editions. However, Noble Butler
published two grammars in Louisville in 184:5, which appeared
in several editions. These were: Introductory Lessons in English
Grammar, and A Practical Grammar of the English Language.

GRAMMARS, 1850-1 900

In discussing the grammars of the second half of the eighteenth
century, it must be kept in mind that most of the many popular

130 OLD TEXTBOOKS

grammars that were first published in the 184.<0’s continued to
be revised and republished in the 1850’s, and even in the 1860’s
and 18"/O’s. So it could be expected that not many new popular
grammars would be published in the 1850’s, or even in the 1860’s.
That was exactly what happened. The books first published in
the 1850’s of only two authors attained considerable circulation
——those of Covell and of Burtt.

Covell. In 1852 L. T. Covell wrote A Digest of English Gram-
mar, Synthetical and Analytical. However, it is more than a
digest, for it contained 9219 pages of context. Incidentally, this
book contained 22 extra pages of advertising of other books for
sale by the publishers. Although the book used the then modern
terms of synthetical and analytical in the title, its organization
reverted to the four traditional divisions of grammar. Never-
theless it must have had considerable circulation, for it was re-
published in numerous editions for at least two decades. In 1853

_Covell wrote a Primary Grammar of 120 pages as introductory

to the Digest.

Burtt. The second author to publish a grammar in the 1850’s
was Andrew Burtt. In 1859 the Elements of English, Grammar,
Synthetic and Analytical appeared. In 1874: a revised and en-
larged edition of this book was published. In 1868 his Practical
Grammar of the English Language, Synthetic and Analytic
appeared as a larger book. It, too, used the four traditional
divisions. However, the emphases of these divisions differed con-
siderably. For example, in the Elements only 80 pages were
devoted to syntax; in the Practical, 116 pages. The latter ap-
peared in several editions for a decade. Then in 1873 Burtt
wrote A Primary Grammar to precede the Practical. ‘

K erl. In 1861 a Comprehensive Grammar of the English Lan-
gaage by Simon Kerl appeared. It was somewhat larger than
most grammars of that period. Too, it was organized very differ-
ently from the grammars of Covell and Burtt. As Kerl stated
in the preface, “It is built up, in Part First, by a regular syn-
thesis, from the Alphabet to Analysis; in Part Second, from

GRAMMARS 131

Pronunciation to Versiﬁcation; and closes with a thorough and
well—authorized section on Punctuation, as teaching the finish to
the whole.” In the latter part of the book there is a treatment of
“Rhetorical Devices.” Throughout, deﬁnitions or rules are al-
ways preceded by a question and followed by examples.  

Apparently certain objections arose to the arrangements of
the Comprehensive Grammar, for in 1865 Kerl’s Comm0n—School
Grammar was published. It was divided into six parts, as fol-
lows: Part I, An Outline «for Beginners; Part II, Words Un-
combined; Part III, Words Grammatically Combined; PartIV,
Words Logically Combined; Part V, Words Improperly Com-
bined; and Part VI, Ornament and Finish. Too, the material
was presented in a less complicated manner. Evidently this book
was more successful, for it appeared in many editions for about
two decades. Both books certainly represented radical departures
from the traditional presentations of grammar.

Also in 1865 Kerl wrote the First Lessons in English Grammar.
As the title implied, this was a smaller and simpler book. Its
parts were: Part I, Deﬁnitions; Part II, Inﬂections; and Part
III, Constructions. In 1870 Kerl’s fourth grammar was published,
A Shorter Course in English Grammar. Evidently he keenly
Wanted to overcome the criticisms of his previous grammars, for
in the preface he frankly discussed the problems in ‘writing a
grammar. He said, “Great care has been taken, and no incon-
siderable expense has been incurred, to ascertain the views of
the ablest teachers, and to modify the work accordingly.” He
then claimed that this was “different from any thing of the
kind,” and yet he “carefully avoided oddity, for innovation is
not necessarily improvement.” The bookwas divided as follows:
Oral Course, and Text Course Words, Sentences, and False
Syntax. I

The foregoing facts about these grammars certainly revealed
that Kerl, like Roswell Smith in 1829, attempted to change and
vitalize the teaching of grammar by departing from the tradi-

. tional organization and procedure commonly followed in gram-

mar books.

Quackenbos. G. P. Quackenbos, like Noah Webster, Peter Parley

132 OLD TEXTBOOKS

(S. G. Goodrich), Comstock, and a few others, was a proliﬁc
textbook writer. His textbooks in the ﬁelds of English composi-
tion, American history, and natural philosophy (physics),
gained wide circulation. Eventually, in 1862, he wrote An
English Grammar. He presented the material in the form of
short lessons. In all, the book contained 101 lessons. Although
the material did not appear under the four traditional parts, the
contents of the lessons appeared largely in the same order of
the traditional organization. However, the approachwas not fully
deductive, for the “deﬁnitions are approached by means of pre-
liminary illustrations, which make their abstract language in-
telligible while it is in process of learning.” Thus the emphasis
was on developing an understanding rather than mere memory.
This book appeared in numerous editions for at least a decade.

  Hart. Also in 1862 A Grammar of the English Language by

John S. Hart was published. In the same year it was “introduced
as a class book into the Grammar Schools of the (Philadelphia)
District.” It followed the traditional organization and was
smaller than many other grammars. The deﬁnitions and rules
were very plainly presented, and apparently were to be memo-
rized. In 1874 he revised, enlarged, and changed this book. Part
III presented the following: Sentences, Syntax and Analysis;
Punctuation; Figures; and Versiﬁcation. It included more ana-
lytical exercises.

Also, in 1874 he wrote the Language Lessons for Beginners.
This was a very small book of '7 9 pages, merely dealing briefly
with the various parts of speech. In 187 8 he published An Ele-
mentary Grammar, apparently to replace the smaller Language
Lessons. The three parts dealt brieﬂy with orthography, ety-

mology, and syntax. Hart also wrote books on literature and A

composition. His Manual of Composition and Rhetoric, ﬁrst pub-
lished in 1870, appeared in many editions for more than two
decades. It was much more popular than any of his grammars.

Harvey. In 1868 the same publishing company that published
the McGuﬁ'ey Readers and the Ray’s Arithmetics, which would
help the sale of any textbook, produced A Practical Grammar

GRAMMARS 133

by Thomas W. Harvey. The title page stated that it was for
“use of schools of every grade.” This, like many grammars,
presented the content in the four traditional parts. Apparently
its chief appeal was its concreteness. For example, definitions
were always followed by illustrations, as follows: “A verb is a
word which expresses being, action, or state; as, I am; George
writes; The house stands.” In 1878 this book was somewhat
revised with a section on Diagrams added. In 1900 Harvey
radically revised it and changed the title to A New English
Grammar. Too, he changed its organization as follows: Part I,
Elements of Syntax and Etymology; Part II, Elements of
Orthography; Part III, Etymology; Part IV, Complex Syntax;
Part V, Punctuation and Capitals; Part VI, Prosody; and then
a section on Diagrams. Its concreteness was retained, with more
questions and work exercises added. His books had a big sale in
the midwest. Harvey also wrote An Elementary Grammar, in
1869, which apparently did not attain the popularity of the
above mentioned books.

Hadley. In 1871 Hiram Had-
ley wrote Lessons in Lan-
guage. This book was very
different from even the ele-
mentary grammars written
theretofore. It was largely in-
ductive in approach and at-
tempted to teach grammatical
matters without using the
regular grammatical terminol-
ogy. Too, it included many
pictures about which many
questions were asked, such as
the objects shown, action rep-
resented, and other character-

proach’ to composition.

134, OLD TEXTBOOKS

istics involved. Then in 187 6 and 1878 it was markedly revised
and appeared in two volumes, as Part I and Part II, both bearing
the old title, Lessons in Language. Part I again included many
pictures, and omitted the use of technical terms, but instead re-
ferred to Action—words, Modifying-words, Quality—words, etc.

On the other hand, Part II omitted pictures, and began to use

such grammatical terms as nouns, verbs, etc.

Swinton. The author whose grammars had the greatest circula-
tion during the second half of the nineteenth century was Wil-

liam Swinton. He, like severalother authors, was also the writer

of popular textbooks in other ﬁelds. He Wrote books in the ﬁelds
of literature, composition, reading, and spelling. In the latter
two ﬁelds his books were widely used. He was unusually proliﬁc
in producing textbooks in rapid succession. His first speller ap-
peared in 1871, grammar in 1872, composition in 1874, litera-
ture in 1880, and readers in 1882. And in most of these ﬁelds
he wrote more than one textbook.

His ﬁrst grammar was A
Progressive Grammar in 1872.
Courageously he stated that,
“In this textbook, of the four
medieval ‘branches’ of gram-
mar, two have been lopped off
——to wit, Orthography and
Prosody.” However, this book
was. also divided into four
parts, but two were not the
traditional. The parts were:
Etymology, Syntax, Analysis
and Construction, and Eng-
lish Composition. Like Har-
vey’s Grammar, it contained
many examples and exercises.

-——popular for many. decades in the

Midwest.

GRAMMARS 135

In 1873 he wrote the Language Lessons as an introduction to his
Grammar. The emphasis in the Lessons was on language and
composition. Much of the work was presented inductively so as
to lead to an understanding of sentence structure. Then in 1874
he wrote the Language Primer to precede even the Lessons. Thus
a graded series of three books resulted. This, too, was largely
inductive. In 1877 he revised and enlarged the Lessons, and en-
titled it the N ew Language Lessons, with the sub—title of -An Ele-
mentary Grammar and Composition.

Also in 1877 he wrote A Gramma/r. This was to replace his
ﬁrst, A Progressive Grammar. When he ﬁrst wrote the latter he
intended it to be his only grammar. When he began a series this
new advanced grammar became one of the series. It was divided
into three sections: Etymology, Syntax, and Analysis. In con-
trast to the Primer and the Lessons, it was more like other
grammar textbooks, and was largely deductive in approach. A
statement on the title page claimed it to be “for advanced gram-
mar grades, and for high schools, academies, etc.” It was pub-
lished in two forms or editions, one solely a grammar of 256
pages, and the other with A School Manual of English Com-
position of 118 pages added as a supplement. One of the out-
standing characteristics of these books was their emphasis on
composition, rather than a mere understanding of technical
grammar. Finally, in 1880 he wrote An Elementary Grammar
and Composition. In summary, apparently Swinton’s English
books took the grammar market by storm. These books appeared
in many editions for more than a decade. However, their use
did not continue as long as many other grammars.

Reed and Kellogg. The last really popular grammars written
during this period were those by Alonzo Reed and Brainerd
Kellogg. They, like several authors, also wrote texts in spelling,
rhetoric, and literature. Their Work on English Grammar and
Composition was published in 1877. This book, like SWinton’s,
stressed language and composition rather than technical gram-
mar. The authors were critical of the disciplinary value of tradi-
tional grammar in saying:

136 OLD TEXTBOOKS

The worth of grammar as mental gymnastics or as linguistic philoso-
phy or asboth cannot and will not much longer justify for a place
in our common and our graded schools—-it must bear on its branches
more obvious and more serviceable fruit, or the tree will be hewn
down and cast out of the way. '

Its study should become a “tributary to the Art of Expression.”
Their approach was to deal with the function of language be-
fore its technical analysis. Their grammar was divided into the
following four parts: The Sentence and the Parts of Speech, 120
pages; Parts of Speech Sub-divided, 34 pages; Modiﬁcations
of the Parts of Speech, 80 pages; and Composition, 34 pages.
These parts were radically different from the traditional four
of Murray and his many disciples. The book was slightly revised
and enlarged in 1885, 1896, and 1909. The last edition was
entitled Higher Lessons in English, but the titles of the four
parts remained the same in all of the editions. a

In 1878 the same authors wrote An Elementary English Gram-
mar to precede the Work on English Grammar. In this intro-
ductory book they also stressed the study of language rather
than technical grammar. Concerning other grammars they criti-
cally stated:

The greater number bewilder the pupil with prolix discussions, and
vex him with obscure deﬁnitions, and numberless rules with their
suicidal exceptions. They load his memory, with technicalities and
appall him with authorities, and dull his understanding with endless
routine parsing and analysis. With them Grammar is a science, or it
is nothing.

The book contained 100 lessons and 164: pages. It was recopy-
righted in 1889 with 34 pages added in the back, mostly consist-
ing of “Notes for Teachers.” In 1898 Reed alone wrote even a
simpler book entitled, Introductory Language Work. All of
these books appeared in numerous editions for at least three
decades.

Hyde. Mention should be made concerning a woman author of
this period. In 1887 there appeared the Practical Lessons in
the Use of English, First Book, by Mary F. Hyde. It contained

GRAMMARS 137

two parts with many pictures. The next year came the Second
Book with Supplement. It contained Parts III and IV. The
Supplement provided 202 pages of review lessons, in all 419
pages. In 1893 Miss Hyde wrote the Advanced Lessons in Eng-
lish, designed primarily for pupils who had completed the
Practical Lessons series. It was divided in four parts: Kinds of
Words—The Parts of Speech; Classes and Forms of Words;
Relations of Words-——SyntaX; and Structure and Analysis of
Sentences. However, it was much smaller than the Second Book.
These books appeared in several editions.

Others. The grammars of a number of other authors gained
limited popularity during the last two decades of the nineteenth
century. William D. Whitney’s Essentials of English Grammar
was published in 1877, and later appeared in several editions.
Lessons in English by Sara E. Lockwood was published in 1888,
and her An English Grammar in 1892. Lessons in Language by
Horace S. Tarbell was published in 1890, and then revised with
the assistance of MarthaiTarbell in 1900.

METHODS AND APPROACHES

Most of the early American grammars followed their English
predecessors in organizing into large parts, commonly four, and
then often dividing the parts into sections, chapters, or lessons.
Several books were originally used in manuscript form in the
classroom and then later published. These were then organized
in the form of lectures or lessons. It can be concluded that the
organization of the grammars was much more varied than the
content.

More important than the major divisions of the organization
was the more detailed arrangement and presentation of the learn-
ing content. Here there was much variation. Most of the early
grammars used the deductive approach. In these the definitions
and rules were ﬁrst presented, apparently to be memorized, then
followed by exercises in which they were applied. However, cer-
tain authors, beginning in the 1820’s, used the inductive or
modiﬁed approaches. In 1821 Ingersoll’s Conversations on

138 OLD TEXTBOOKS

English Grammar was published. Then followed a more popular
grammar by Smith in 1830 entitled, Intellectual and Practical
Grammar, in a Series of Inductive Questions. This, and other
books by Smith, created a considerable stir in grammar teaching.
This approach was favored by the famous Henry Barnard. Later
one of Nutting’s books also used the inductive approach. These
books were severely criticized by Goold Brown, whoin later life
assumed the position of critic extraordinary, in his Grammar of
English Grammars, in the following terms:

The vain pretensions of several modern simpliﬁers, contrivers of
machines, charts, tables, diagrams, Vincula, pictures, dialogues, fa-
miliar lectures, ocular analysis, tabular compendiums, inductive ex-
ercises, productive systems, intellectual methods, and various new
theories, for the purpose of teaching grammar, may serve to deceive
the ignorant, to amuse the visionary, and to excite the admiration
of the credulous ; but none of these things has any favorable relation
to that improvement which may justly be boasted as having taken
place within the memory of the present generation . . . but no con-
trivance can ever relieve the pupil from the necessity of committing
them (deﬁnitions andrules) thoroughly to memory. (p. 107)

Then Brown became more personal, in pointing his criticism
against the above mentioned grammar by Smith, saying, “It is
a work which certainly will be ‘productive’ of no good to anybody
but the author and his publishers.” In spite of Brown’s criticism
many later grammars used the inductive approach. p
During the 1850’s ‘another approach developed; namely, the
analytical. In fact, in 1849 Peter Bullions published An Ana-
lytical and Practical Grammar of the English Language. Soon
thereafter the popular grammars written by Clark, Pinneo, and
Covell used the word analytical in the titles, and those of Greene
and of Burtt followed this approach. Kerl and a few others used
what may be termed the developmental approach. Then in the
1870’s the emphasis was on correct composition and rhetoric,
both oral and written. The popular books by Swinton and also
those by Reed and Kellogg emphasized the functional approach
of English grammar. The books of the latter authors continued
in use until well after 1900. Although the writer has not at-
tempted to analyze grammars after 1900, Lyman has charac-

GRAMMARS 139

terized the period of 1891-1920 as the “elimination period or
the incidental study period, the chief tendency of which is the
gradual subordination of formal grammar to its proper place as
incidental to the study of composition and literature.”  

The approaches of teaching grammar have varied and changed
from time to time between 1750 and 1900, and at no time did
all the leading grammars follow the same procedure.

ARITHMETICS

THE EARLI ES T

RECOGNITION of elements of arithmetic seem to be as old as
recorded history of man. Ancient Egyptians, Babylonians,
Hindus, Greeks, and Romans all have made contributions to the
development of arithmetic. With the growth of ﬁelds of learning
arithmetic became recognized as one of the seven Liberal Arts.
Arithmetic is one of the oldest of school sub ects.

Possibly the first treatise on arithmetic in English was written
and published in England in 1537, and entitled, An Introduction
for to: Lerne to,Reckon with the Pen and with the Counters
after the True Cast of Arsmetyke or Awgrym. Likely the first
popular English arithmetic was Recorde’s Arithmetick: or, The
Grounde of Arts in 15442. Other very early English arithmetics
which evidently inﬂuenced early American texts were Edmund
Wingate’s Arithmetique Made Easie (1629) ; William Mather’s
The Young Man’s Companion: or, Arithmetick Made Easy;
John Ward’s The Young M athematician’s Guide. Being a Plain
and Easie Introduction to the Mathematicks (1706), of which
Part I and part of Part V dealt with arithmetic; John Hill’s
Arithmetick, Both in Theory and Practice (1712) ; and others,
some of which later were reprinted in America to be discussed
subsequently.

ARITHMETICS 143

The first seven arithmetic textbooks published in the Americas
were in Spanish, four in Mexico and three in Lima, Peru. The
first mathematics textbook was the Sumario Compendioso (1556)
written by Juan Diez Freyle, and the first separate arithmetic
was the Arte Para Aprender Todo El M enori Del Arithmetica
by Pedro de Paz (1623) , both published in Mexico. Incidentally,
the first university in America was founded in Mexico in 1554:, in
which later the first lecturer in mathematics was Juan Negrete.

Apparently, most of the earliest arithmetic books used by the
American colonists were reprints of English books. No copyright
laws then applied. The first of these was William Bradf-ord’s
The Secretarg’s Guide in 1705. It appeared in at least seven
editions. Part II was “Arithmetick made easie.” A similar but
better book was George Fisher’s The Instructor: or, Young
M an’s Best Companion (1748), which was rather fully based on
an English text, and appeared here in about a dozen editions
before 1800. Much of this book dealt with the practical applica-
tions of arithmetic. The last part of the book was entitled, “The
Practical Granger,” which in part dealt with some elements of
surveying. It has been claimed that George Washington made
Wide use of this book. In a sense this book was a forerunner of
the World Book of Knowledge. However, the first arithmetic
as a separate treatise was James Hodder’s Arithmeticlc: or, That
Necessary Art Made Most Easy (Boston, 1719), which was a
reprint of the 25th English edition.

Thomas Dilworth. The text which was reprinted most often and
which had by far the widest circulation here of any English
authored arithmetic was Thomas Dilw0I‘th’s The Schoolmaster’s
Assistant; Being a Compendium of Arithmetic both Practical
and Theoretical (1773). Since arithmetics did not appear in
graded series until about 1830, the early ones contained all
phases of arithmetic in a single book. Thus Dilworth’s text had
five parts. Part I, Of Whole Numbers. Part II, Of Vulgar
Fractions. Part III, Of Decimal Fractions. Part IV, Questions.
Part V, Of Duodecimals.

Part I not only dealt with the simple fundamentals of arith-
metic, but with such topics as interest, rebate, compound fellow-

144 OLD TEXTBOOKS

ship, weights and measures, double rule of three, alligation
medial, and permutation. Part II dealt with vulgar or common
fractions. Part III not only dealt with the fundamentals of
decimal fractions, but also with square root, cube root, biquadrate
root, sursolid root, second sursolid root, square biquadrate root,
squared square cube root, and annuities and pensions. Part IV
consisted mainly of 104 miscellaneous problems ‘requiring solu-
tion. Many of these problems were stated in ﬂowery rhetorical
form; two even in poetic form. No. 87 follows:

Part V, in dealing with duodecimals, deﬁned them as “Fractions
of a Foot, or of an Inch, or any Part of an Inch, having 12 for
their Denominator.” The table of duodecimals was as follows:

Note, 12 Fourths make 1 Third.
12 Thirds make 1 Second.
12 Seconds make 1 Inch.
12 Inches make 1 Foot.

The explanatory contents throughout the book were presented
in catechetical form. For example:

Q. What is the use of Addition?
A. Addition teacheth to bring several particular numbers into one
total sum.
Q. How many sorts of Addition are there?
A. Two, viz. simple and compound.

After examining Dilworth’s book one may Wonder why it became
so popular, yet in fact reprints of it continued to appear here
for about ﬁfty years. Furthermore, it inﬂuenced greatly the
earliest American written arithmetics.

Following the ﬁrst reprint of Dilworth’s text here (17 73),
according to Karpinski,1 a number of other English arithmetics
were reprinted here. Among them were: Daniel Fenning’s Ready
Reckoner, or, Traders Useful Assistant (1774:), which was really
only a book of useful tables; Cocker’s Arithmetick (1779) ; John
Bonnycastle’s The Scholar’s Guide to Arithmetic (1786) ;
Gough’s A Treatise of Arithmetic (1788) ; and Daniel Fenning’s
American Y outh’s Instructor (1795).

CONTENT

It is believed generally that the contents of mathematics text-
books have changed less through the years than those in most
other fields. This likely is true. Nevertheless some marked changes
have taken place in American arithmetic textbooks. The ﬁndings
of several studies are summarized in Table V. Burry’s study in-
cludes an analysis of 65 arithmetics before 1810. The study by
Smith and Eaton includes an analysis of a sampling of the
arithmetics between 1820 and 1880. The sample does include
an analysis of the more popular arithmetics, and thus reﬂects
rather accurately what most pupils were taught in arithmetic. It
may be noted that some rather marked changes took place be-
tween the textbooks before 1810 and those after 1820. The im-
portant topics that received most decreasing attention with time
were: foreign exchange dropping from 8.7 per cent in the earliest
books to 1.5 per cent in the last period; compound denominate
numbers from 16 per cent to 9 per cent and treatment of federal

McNally & Company 1925), pp. 85-90.

ARITHMETICS 147

money from 5 per cent to 2.4: per cent. Also, many topics that
received at least noticeable attention in the earlier books virtually
disappeared in the later ones. Among such topics were alligation;
duodecimals; position, or rule of false; tare, tret, and cloff;
barter; and permutations and combinations. In addition, some
topics not listed in the table appear in the oldest arithmetics
but seldom in the later ones, such as, bookkeeping, algebra,
banking, and imports and exports. Also many tables that were
included in at least some early arithmetics are no longer in more
recent ones. Among them are tables related to ﬁsh, books, nautical
measure, tret, English square measure, gunpowder, jeweller’s
weight, lead weight, paper and parchment, reﬁner’s Weight, wood
and bark measure, bread, tare, Winchester measure, and measures
of ale, beer, wool, wine, and cloth.

On the other hand, increased treatment has been given many
topics. Treatment of the fundamental processes involving whole
numbers increased from 9.3 per cent to 16.6 per cent to ﬁrst
rank; vulgar (common) fractions from 6.9 per cent to 11.9 per
cent; partial payments from
.9 per cent to 3.8 per cent;
and numeration from 1.5 per
cent to 3.1 per cent. It is
clear that more topics have
virtually disappeared or been
totally dropped than have
been added. In other words,
the more recent authors of
arithmetics aim to deal only
with those topics most likely
to be useful in post—school life.

Not only has there been
considerable variation in em-
phasis on certain topics from
period to period, great varia-
tion has appeared among in-

dividual books of a period. For example Jones2 analyzed the
treatment of vulgar (common) fractions in 110 arithmetics be-
fore 18450. The mean amount of space given to fractions per book
was 20.2 pages in the main section and 23.6 pages in the total
treatment. However, the range was from 0.4 to 92.9 pages for
the former phase, and from 0.6 to 117.7 for the latter. Likewise,
there was variation in the relative placement of the two phases.
The space division of the different aspects of fractions was as
follows: introductory concepts, 11.9 per cent; reduction, 39.3
per cent; addition, '7 .8 per cent; subtraction, 7.4 per cent; mul-
tiplication, 14.1 per cent; division, 9.6 per cent; Rule of Three,
5.4 per cent; and miscellaneous, 4.4 per cent. The rules and
explanations dealing with fractions varied considerably.

CHARACTERISTICS

Graded series. In arithmetic, as in other subject ﬁelds, graded
series were not common until about 1830. It is true that a num-
ber of authors of early arithmetics wrote more than one book, but
generally the later books would be revisions or replacements of
the earlier one. This was true of the popular arithmetics of
Pike and Adams. One of the ﬁrst attempts at grading was done
by Colburn. In 1821 his First Lessons in Arithmetic appeared,
followed in 1822 by a more difficult book, Sequel to First Lessons.
In the Sequel he stated that it was not absolutely necessary to
have studied the First Lesson before the Sequel. Even after
graded series became common, the upper book or books very
commonly would begin with the fundamentals and fractions
nearly as though they had not been taught from a lower book.
Too, in many cases the ﬁrst book written by an author would be
a “complete” book, then later a lower book would be written as
an afterthought. For example, Davies wrote his Common School
Arithmetic in 1833, but his First Lessons not until 1840.

The ﬁrst well—planned graded series was by Emerson. In 1829

2 Emily K. Jones, “An Historical Surveyiof the Developmental Treatment of
Vulgar Fractions in American Arithmetics from 1719 to 1839.” (Unpublished
doctor’s dissertation. University of Pittsburgh, 1957).

ARITHMETICS 151

he wrote the North American Arithmetic, Part First. In 1832
Part Second, and in 1834 Part Third. In 1837 Joseph Ray
wrote the Arithmetic, Part First; Part Second; and Part Third.
Thereafter nearly all popular arithmetics appeared in series,
although the lowest book did not always appear ﬁrst. However,
all series did not consist of three books. Several series, counting
the “Advanced” or “High School” arithmetics, were composed
of four books. On the other hand, several series contained only
two books. In fact, some authors eventually wrote two series,
one of two and the other of three books. Apparently some parents
and schools objected to buying three books, so the two—book
series developed. 1

Mental arithmetic. Even before arithmetics appeared in well
graded series, some authors emphasized the teaching of begin-
ning arithmetic mentally. Both of C-olburn’s books stressed
mental work. Thereafter at least one book of the series by Ray,
Grreenleaf, Thomson, Stoddard, Brooks, and Wentworth, con-
tained either the word mental or intellectual in the title. How-
ever, the stress on mental arithmetic somewhat lessened the latter
part of the nineteenth century. In fact, many of the books con-
tained the statement that the exercises were ﬁrst mental and then
for the slate.

Methods and approaches. The contents of nearly all early arith-
metics were so arranged as to imply the use of the deductive
approach in teaching. A few did this by presenting the definitive
matters of arithmetic like a catechism, by means of questions
and prepared answers to be committed to memory. This was true
of Dilworth’s Assistant, Davies’ Practical and Mental in 18Q9,
and Thomson’s First Lessons. However, by far they most com-
monly used deductive approach, especially in the advanced arith-
metics, was first to present the deﬁnitions, tables, etc., to be
committed, which later were to be applied to exercises or prob-
lems.

The ﬁrst important author to use the inductive approach was
Colburn. His First Lessons in Arithmetic on the Plan of Pesta-

1% (HJ)TEXTBOOKS

lozzi was definitely inductive. Then in 1826 he had this book
recopyrighted with the word Inductive in the title. In 1827
Adams’ Arithmetic claimed to combine the advantages of both
the “inductive and synthetic” approaches. In 1829 Smith pub-
lished an arithmetic on the Pestalozzian plan. Numerous other
authors prepared at least their lower arithmetics either partly
or largely on the inductive approach. Naturally the mental
arithmetics were largely inductive. An understanding of rules
and combinations was to be developed by means of exercises
rather than by memorization.

Then about 1850 many of the books claimed to follow the
analytic or analytic and synthetic approaches. Several even in-
cluded the word Analytic in the title. This was true at leastof
one or more of the arithmetics written by Davies, Ray, Green-
leaf, Thomson, and Dean. In a sense these combined some of the
features both of the -inductive and deductive approaches.

Many authors attempted to help the teachers of arithmetic
find the most effective method to use the books. A large fraction
of the texts contained some such help. In many texts such help
was presented in the preface. In others an additional special
section, such as, “To Teachers,” “Helps to Teachers,” or “Sug-
gestions to Teachers” was included. Usually these helps were in
the beginning of the text, but some included a longer section in
the back. In Brooks’ Normal Primary Arithmetic (1858) ten
pages of very fine print were devoted to a Preface, Suggestions
to Teachers, and Remarks concerning the procedures to be fol-
lowed. French’s Elementary Arithmetic (1867) used four pages
of ﬁne print to explain the nature of the book in the Preface,
and then in the back used twelve pages to present a Manual of
Methods and Suggestions. Most of these suggestions were very
specific in referring to particular problems and pages of the
text.

Pictures and illustrations. The authors of arithmetic textbooks
were slower to use pictures than those of spellers, readers, and
geographies. One of the first to do so was Frederick Emerson in
his North American Arithmetic: Part First (1829), which was

ARITHMETICS 153

the first book of the first well—graded arithmetic series. Pictures
or counters were used on every page of the book except the pages
of miscellaneous examples. The pictures evidently were wood
cuts. However, Part Second and Part Third did not contain
pictures. In 1830 Barnard’s A Treatise on Arithmetic used
numerous pictures. After 1850 many of the primary arithmetics
contained pictures, especially the later editions of the most popu-
lar series. Among them were books by Ray, Fish, White, Goff,
and Wentworth. One of the first upper or advanced books to
include pictures was French’s Common School Arithmetic in
1869. For more than two decades this practice became comm-on.
Evidently the Oswego Movement, which stressed the use of ob-
jects and pictures, contributed greatly to the use of objects and
pictures in arithmetic textbooks.

Workbook and manuals. Many modern educators believe that
the use of workbooks is of very recent origin. Though of different
form, many old arithmetics
contained or implied such use.
One of the first arithmetics to
do this was Samuel Temple’s
An Arithmetical Primer in
1809. Blank spaces were left
for the solution of the prob-
lems. For example, a problem
in subtraction was:

7854
5906

Diff.
Proof

Temple, An Arithmetical Primer,
1809, forerunner of the modern
workbook.

154 OLD TEXTBOOKS

This practice continued throughout the text. The earliest editions
of Adams’ The Scholar’s Arithmetic even earlier had left blank
spaces on some pages, but the later editions did not. However, it
must be said that the practice was not common. A few books
contained directions for work which in a sense resembled the
features of a workbook. For example, the First Steps in Number:
A Primary Arithmetic (1885) by Wentworth and Reed headed
many lessons with directions, as “Copy and complete,” “Copy
and ﬁnd the answers,” etc.

Another type of book, which has often been classiﬁed as an
arithmetic but really in a technical sense was not, was one like
Daniel Fenning’s The Ready Reckoner; or Trader’s Most Useful
Assistant. The first seven pages dealt witl1 instructions regarding
its use; the remaining pages of the rather large book consisted
of detailed schemes and tables for calculating the price of things.
This book was first printed in England and then reprinted in
America. One edition was printed in Germantown, Pennsylvania,
in 1774:. Other similar books later appeared, but they should not
be considered as regular school textbooks.

Answers and keys. Very early, most arithmetic textbooks in-
cluded the answers to the problems. In most cases the answers
immediately followed the problems, but in some books they ap-
peared in the back. Some publishers printed two editions——one
with and one without answers. Since teachers were very poorly
prepared in those early times, apparently the demand soon‘ arose
for more help than merely the answers. So the practice developed
to publish Keys, which would not only contain the answers but
also the steps involved in the solution of the most difficult prob-
lems. In a few cases the Key would appear in ﬁne print in the
back of the book, as in Colburn’s First Lessons. More often,
however, the Key would be a separate book, apparently for use
by teachers only. One of the ﬁrst of this type was prepared by
Frederic McKenny for Crukshank’s American Tut0r’s Assistant
in 1809. Later McKenny also prepared one for Pike’s Teacher’s
Assistant. Armstrong published a Key for Stockton’s Western
Calculator in 1824. Later Keys were published for the popular
arithmetics of Ray, Brooks, and others.

ARITHMETICS 155

Unusual problems. Early arithmetics often contained very un-
usual, though interesting, problems. One which appeared in a
number of arithmetics, including Dilworth’s, was:

A Man driving his Geese to the Market, was met by another, who
said, Good Morrow, Master with your Hundred Geese. Says he, I
have not an Hundred; but if I have half as many as I now have, and
two Geese and an half, beside the Number I have already, I should
have an Hundred; How many had he? Answer 65

Dilworth’s text also had numerous problems dealing with differ-
ent kinds of liquor. For example:

In 731 gro. bottles of wine, each 1 5/7 pint, how many hhds._?
Answer 29 hhds. 52 gals. 5 pts. 5/7

Another problem that was found in a number of books, including
Pike’s, was:

How many combinations can be made of 6 letters out of the 24 letters
of the alphabet? Answer 134596

A similar problem appeared in Thomson’s, as follows:

How many different ways may a class of 26 scholars be arranged?

Another in Thomson’s was :

A, B, and C, can trench a meadow in 12 days; B, C, and D, in 14«
days; and C, D, and A, in 15 days; and D, B, and A, in 18 days. In
what time would it be done by all of them together, and by each of
them singly?

Many clock problems appeared in old arithmetics. Stoddard’s
American Philosophical Arithmetic contained this one:

At what time between 2 and 3 o’clock will the hour and minute hand
be together?

Another problem in Stoddard’s was:

A deer is 180 leaps before a hound, and takes 4 leaps to the hound’s

156 OLD TEXTBOOKS

9; and 5 of the deer’s leaps are equal to 9 of the hound’s. How many
leaps must the hound take to catch the deer?

Ray’s Higher Arithmetic was Well known for its many puzzling
problems. Here follow several:

How far does a man walk while planting a ﬁeld of corn 285 ft.
square, the rows being 3 ft. apart and 3 ft. from the fences? 5 mi.
6 rd. 6 ft.

A wooden wheel of uniform thickness, 4 ft. in diameter, stands in
mud 1 ft. deep: what fraction of the wheel is out of the mud? .804«49+
of it.

How many inch balls can be put in a box which measures, inside,
10 in. square, and is 5 in. deep? 568 balls

I have an inch board 5 ft. long, 17 in. wide at one end, and 7 in. at
the other: how far from the larger end must it be cut straight across,
so that the solidities of the two parts shall be equal? 2 ft.

EARLIEST AMERICAN WRITTEN ARITHMETICS

The ﬁrst arithmetic written by a native of colonial America
was the Arithmetick, Vulgar and Decimal (17 29) by Isaac Green-
wood, professor of mathematics at Harvard from 1727 to 17 88.
The second one written here was in Dutch. It was Pieter Vene-
ma’s Arithmetica of Cyﬁer K onst (1730). More than ﬁfty
years later there appeared Dearborn’s The Pu/pil’s Guide (1782) ,
and Alexander McDonald’s The Youth’s Assistant (1785). None

of these attained wide circulation.

Nicholas Pike (1743-1819). The ﬁrst American written arith-
metic to become popular and to give Dilworth’s Assistant keen
competition was Nicholas Pike’s A N etc and Complete System of
Arithmetic (1788), “Composed for the use of the citizens of the
United States.” In fact, Pike had the manuscript for this book
ready in 1785, but used three years to ﬁle copies with several
states in order to secure royalties on it when published, and to
secure endorsements from prominent persons. Recommendations
from Benjamin West, President Ezra Stiles of Yale, Governor
James Bowdoin of (Massachusetts, and others, were in the book.

ARITHMETICS 157

It contained 512 pages of rather ﬁne print. The last 106
pages dealt with logarithms, geometry, trigonometry, mensura-
tion, algebra, and conic sections. The content, in addition to
dealing with the fundamentals of arithmetic, included treatment
of such topics as duodecimals or cross multiplication, single rule
of three, rule of three inverse, conjoined proportion, fellowship,
tare and trett, involution, evolution, annuities, barter, brokerage,
alligation, permutations and combinations, tables of various
weights and measures, chronological problems such as finding
the Julian Epact and ﬁnding the dates of Easter from the year
1753 to 4199, and many other topics. Among the tables not
commonly found in present day arithmetics were those of English
money, troy weight, apothecaries weight, cloth measure, wine
measure, and ale -or beer measure. The measures of beer consisted
of pint, quart, gallon, ﬁrkin, kilderkin, barrel, hogshead, pun-
cheon, and butt. Dutch and French money tables were also in-
cluded. It must have been the ﬁrst arithmetic to include a reprint
of the Act of Congress of 1786 creating the U.S. Federal Money
system of mills, cents, dimes,
dollars, and eagles. However,
none of the problems in the
book involving money were
based on the United States
Federal money system, but
rather on the English.

Although the extensive and
far-fetched list of topics
treated in Pike’s book seems
forbidding, the problems were
always preceded by a rule and
demonstrated by an example.
To illustrate, the Rule of
Three began as follows:

This book was frequently reprinted with only slight revisions as
late as the 1830’s.

In 1793 Pike published an Abridgement of the New and
Complete System of Arithmetic, which contained only 371 pages.
The Preface claimed it suitable for public schools, and spoke of
the larger book as, “That celebrated Work, which is now used
as a classical book in all the New England Universities.” This
book also appeared in numerous editions. The success of these
books must have inﬂuenced other American written arithmetics.
It is doubtful whether these diﬂicult books were ever used in the
elementary schools.

Benjamin Workman. In 1789 he published The American Ac-
countant; or, Schoolmasters’ N ew Assistant. This really was an
abridged revision of Gough’s A Treatise of Arithmetic published
here in 1788. Workman’s book contained 220 pages, while
Gough’s had 370.

Others. During the 1790’s numerous other new arithmetics were
published, but none gained much circulation. Most of these need
mere mention; namely, books by: Consider and John Sterry
(1790); John Vinall (1792); Erastus Root (1793); Thomas
Sargeant (1793); Phinehas Merrill (1793); Todd, Jess, War-
ing, and Paul (1794:) ; Donald Fraser (1796) ; Samuel Temple
(1796) ; James Noyes (1797) ; David Kendall (The Young
Lady’s Arithmetic, 1-797); Wil.liam Milns (1797) ;. F. Nichols

ARI TH M E TI CS, 1800-1820

Between 1800 and 1890 at least ﬁfty different arithmetic text-
books Were published. Lack of space does not permit treatment, or
even mention, of all of them. So only those that gained consider-
able circulation Will be discussed.

Nathan Daboll (1750-1818). In 1800 Daboll published his
Schoolmaster’s Assistant, an “Arithmetic adapted to the United

Noah Webster. It was very plainly and attractively arranged
and printed. Its monetary problems involved both the English
and the American system, and it was the first book to make
frequent use of the $ symbol. With minor revisions it continued
to be published as late as the 1830’s.

Daniel Adams (1773-1864). The author Whose arithmetics gained
the widest circulation of any before those by Joseph Bay was
Adams. In 1801 he published The Scholar’s Arithmetic: or,
Federal Accountant. The contents were more clearly and simply
presented than was done either in Dilworth’s or Pike’s books. The
material was presented in sections, which were entitled as follows:

I Fundamentals of Arithmetic
II Rules Essentially necessary for Every Person to Fit and
Qualify Them for the
Transactions of Busi-

ness
III Rules Occasionally Use-
ful to- Men in Partic-
ular Imployments of
Life
IV Miscellaneous Questions
V Forms of Notes, etc.

One unusual feature wasthat
space was left blank between
the problems for their solu-
tion. In a sense this was a com-
bination textbook and work-
book. Too, he omitted such
impractical matters as biquad—
rate root and sursolid root
found in some other books.
In 1827 he published a
radically revised Arithmetic,

Lee’s Accomptant, for the book-
keeper. V

“in which the principles of operating by numbers are analytically
explained, and synthetically applied; thus combining the advan-
tages to be derived both from the inductive and synthetic mode of
instructing.” This book contained more pages and many more
problems than his earlier book. It contained no blank spaces for
the solution of the problems. It was revised in 1848. Also in 1848
he published a‘ Primary Arithmetic or Mental Operations in N am-
bers. All of these books appeared in numerous editions even as
late as the 1860’s.

Philadelphia during the later colonial and early national period.
It apparently was a common practice for printers to print books
that were not bound by copyrights and sell them. This may be
what Crukshank did with The American Tntor’s Assistant, first
published by Todd, Jess, Waring, and Paul in 1797. In 1809
Crukshank republished this book with certain revisions. In 1813
some further revisions were made. Later it continued through
many reprintings. The full title became The American Tntor’s
Assistant. Revised; or, A Compendions System of Practical
Arithmetic. All of the editions contained a statement on the title
page that it was “Originally compiled by sundry Teachers in
and near Philadelphia.” In some respects it was similar to Adams’
book, but nearly all the money problems were still based on the
English system. It, like many other arithmetics of that period,
contained a section on Bookkeeping.

Incidentally Zachariah Jess, whose name had been connected
with the original 1797 edition, republished the same book with
the same title in 1818, except that he used the American money
system. It may be added that in 1809 Crukshank published a
key for the Assistant prepared
by Frederick iM’Kenney. Since
most teachers were poorly
prepared in those days, keys
were prepared for many of
the popular arithmetics. In
1825 M’Kenney also prepared
a key for Stephen Pike’s
Teachers’ Assistant.

Joseph Stockton. In 1819
Stockton’s Western Calcula-
tor was published in Pitts-
burgh. He claimed that it was
“arranged, defined, and illus-
trated, in a plain and natural

order; adapted to the Use of Schools, throughout the Western
Country and Present Commerce of the United States.” Having
abook published West of the mountains saved the trouble and
expense of shipping eastern published books across the mountains,
which was a cumbersome task then. He aimed to have this book
fit the “age, capacity, and progress of the scholar.” He further
claimed for it “p1ainness and simplicity of style,” “lucid ar-
rangement,” “clearness of definitions,” and brevity. Apparently
it ﬁlled a need in the “western country,” for it appeared in nu-
merous editions for more than two decades. At the time of the
Writing of this book he was president of Pittsburgh Academy,
eventually to become the University of Pittsburgh. In 1824 John
Armstrong published a Key to the Western Calculator.

ARITHMETICS, 1820-1850

None of the early arithmetics appeared in graded series. How-
ever, shortly after 1820 the authors of the more popular arith-
metics began to publish books of varying‘ difficulty. By that time
textbook authors began to think in terms of children as Well as
of subject matter. So books changed radically from those by
Dilworth and Pike. Again only those arithmetics that gained
considerable usage will be discussed.

Warren Colburn (1793-1833). Colburn was the product of the
common schools of lﬂassachusetts and was graduated from Har-
vard in 1820. For some years he was a principal of a private
school in Boston. In addition to being the author of popular
arithmetics, he also Wrote an algebra and readers.

In 1821 Colburn published his First Lessons in Arithmetic
on the Plan of Pestalozzi. In 1826 he secured a new‘ copyright
on the same book, but With the title changed to Intellectual
Arithmetic Upon the Inductive Itlethod of Instruction. Without
a change in the book new copyrights were secured in 1849 and
in 1858. Again a new copyright was secured in 1863 with a few
pages changed. These three copyrights were secured by his
widow. In 1884 the book was considerably enlarged and changed
with the copyright held by a daughter. A reprint of this ap-

peared as late as 1891. From these facts it can be seen that this
arithmetic, with only a few changes in 1863, remainedin print
for 70 years. Next consideration should be given for the reasons
of its longevity.

The Preface of the First Lessons used nine pages of ﬁne print
to present a “General View of the Plan.” As mentioned on the
title page, it was based on the Pestalozzian or inductive plan of
teaching. Earlier American arithmetics were commonly planned
on the deductive approach. This meant that the pupil was first
to commit the rules and tables and then later apply them to
problems. Colburn’s book began with mental exercises from which
an understanding of the principles of arithmetic was to develop.
For example, the very first question or exercise was, “How many
thumbs have you on your right hand? how many on your left?
how many on both together?” Thus a mastery of the number

ARITHMETICS ' 169

combinations would be developed. Such exercises continued for
124 pages. Then on page 125 “Tables of Coins, Weights, and
,Measures” were presented, followed by exercises involving the
facts of the tables. The last 32 pages constituted the Key with
solutions of the more difficult problems. B. W. Tweed, Supervisor
of Boston Schools, said of the plan:

“Colburn’s First Lessons” have undoubtedly done more to improve
the methods of teaching, not only of numbers, but of language and
other branches, than any other schoo1—book published during the last
half century.

Many other similar quotations could be given concerning the
signiﬁcance of Colburn’s inductive plan.

In 1822 Colburn published his Arithmetic; being a Sequel to
First Lessons in Arithmetic. This was a larger and more advanced
book. He said: “It will be extremely useful, though not absolutely
necessary, for pupils of every age, to study the ‘First Lessons,’
previous to commencing this treatise.” The Sequel contained two
parts. The first contained examples for the illustration and ap-
plication of principles; the second contained the development of
them. The examples of the first part consisted of questions. In
1826 the Sequel was considerably reduced in size. Apparently the
Sequel never attained the popularity of the First Lessons, pos-
sibly because the schools or pupils were not yet ready to purchase
two books in the same sub ect ﬁeld.

Roswell Smith. In 1826 Smith wrote the Practical and Mental
Arithmetic, “designed principally to accompany Daboll’s System
of Arithmetic.” This was a small book of 107 pages, and written
largely in the form of questions with the answers. Many monetary
problems still involved the English system. In 1829 he wrote the
Practical and Mental Arithmetic On a New Plan. This was
largely a new book containing 268 pages. In it the United States
money system was used. Like Colburn’s books it more fully fol-
lowed the Pestalozzian plan. It began with mental exercises,
which were followed by “mental exercises combined with exercises
for the slate.” The tables of coinage and measures were taught
in a catechetical question—and—answer method. The more unusual

1'70 OLD TEXTBOOKS

phases of arithmetic, such as alligation, involution, evolution,
permutation, etc., appeared in the. appendix. In the back there
were ten pages of bookkeeping. This book was recopyrighted in
1835 and in 1859, with only minor changes.  

In 1841 Smith produced an Arithmetic on the Productive
System. This was a much larger book than the other two. He
continued the practice of teaching by means of questions and
answers. It contained several new features not found in previously
discussed arithmetics. Numerous problems were illustrated with
ﬁgure forms, and many pages contained elucidating footnotes
and comments. This book, like the others, appeared in many re-
printings.

It may be added that Smith was also the author of very popu-
lar grammars, and rather widely used geographies. They were
also written on the inductive plan.

Emerson, 1830, one of the ﬁrst illustrated arithmetics.

ARITHMETICS . 171

Frederick Emerson. Although a number of authors wrote more
than one arithmetic before Emerson, none of them prepared as
carefully a graded series as Emerson’s North American Arith-
metic, Part First; Part Second; and Parts Third. In the Preface
he bemoaned the fact that the teaching of arithmetic too often
was postponed to nine or ten years. So Part First, first published
in 1899, was prepared for children from ﬁve toeight years. “The
plan of the lessons accords with the method of instruction prac-
tised in the school at Stanz, by the celebrated Pestalozzi.” Ample
cuts and unit marks illustrate the questions. Emerson was the
first author to make frequent use of pictures and marks or
counters. Forty—two of his 48 pages used such illustrations. The
book was immediately adopted for use in the Boston school. In
1838 a slightly revised edition appeared.

In 1832 Part Second appeared in two editions—one in Boston
of 190 pages, and one in Windsor of 215 pages. The ﬁrst 180
pages were alike in the two editions. Part Second was intended
for use by those who had been taught Part First, or who had
already learned to add, subtract, and multiply numbers as high

as ten, mentally. This book was much more diﬂicult than Part.

First, and did not make use of illustrative pictures.

Part Third was published in 1834:. It was a rather advanced >

book. Emerson stated that it was prepared for two classes; “those

who are to prosecute a fullcourse of mathematical studies, and 8

those who are to embark in commerce.” In addition to teaching
the tables and measures that had been commonly found in most

earlier arithmetics, it included not only many foreign coinage 

tables but also thirty tables of weights and measures of foreign
countries and cities. Apparently these were included for those
preparing for commerce. All three of these arithmetics appeared
in many printings. In 1838 a Key for Part Second and Part
Third was published. The 1854 edition of Part First contained a
statement that these books were used in the cities of Boston,
Salem, Portland, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, and

Louisville. In several places it displaced Colburn’s books.

Charles Davies (179-8-1861). Davies was graduated from the
United States Military Academy in 1815, after which he taught

172 OLD TEXTBOOKS

mathematics there for more than twenty years. Later he taught
at several colleges, ending his teaching career at Columbia Uni-
versity. Undoubtedly he became one of the most proliﬁc mathe-
matics textbook writers in the United States. In addition to
writing at least seven diflerent arithmetic books, he wrote three

popular algebras, three geometries, a calculus book, a combined

geometry and trigonometry book, a general mathematics book,
and one dealing with surveying and navigation.

He wrote the Common’ School Arithmetic in 1833. Its primary
purpose was to prepare “young gentlemen . . . to enter the
Military Academy at West Point.” It was Written in a very
systematic manner. He began each section or topic with an ex-
ample followed by a deﬁnition to be committed printed in italics.
Then followed the rule or rules, review questions, and finally
problems (applications) to be solved. This book was rather

ARITHMETICS 173

thoroughly revised and enlarged in 1838. Its new title was
Arithmetic, “designed for Schools and Academies.” The plan
was very similar to the earlier one, but the review questions ap-
peared merely as footnotes and more problems of application
were introduced. A considerable number of mental exercises were
added. The book was again revised and enlarged in 1850, but in
1855 was reduced in size. The title was changed to School Arith-

I metic: Analytical and Practical. All of these appeared repeatedly.

After two editions of his earlier arithmetics, Davies awakened
to the fact that an easier book ought to precede them. So in 1840
he published his First Lessons in Arithmetic. This book, like his
others, was logically written, but was not nearly so attractive as
Emerson’s Part First. It used some symbols, but no pictures. In
1855 it was made much smaller a11d the title changed to Primary
Arithmetic and Table Book. Neither of these seemed to have had
the popularity of his Arithmetic.

In 1850 Davies published an advanced book entitled The
University Arithmetic. Thus he had arithmetics for three levels,
but graded very differently from Emerson’s series. The purpose
of the advanced book was to treat arithmetic as a science. An-
other purpose was “to adapt it to the business wants of the
country.” About 90 ‘pages were devoted to matters of business
and commerce. In 1864: it was revised and enlarged. It had many

printings.

In summation, it may be said that Davies was a mathemati-
cian, but not so fully a pedagogue. While he presented the ma-
terial logically and much better than Dilworth and Pike, yet
not so simply and psychologically as Colburn, Smith, and
Emerson.

Joseph Ray (1807-1857). Ray was born on a farm not far from
Wheeling, when it was still a part of Virginia. This farm was
only a little more than ten miles from the one on which McGruffey
was born across the line in Pennsylvania. Since farming did not
appeal to him, he left home at 16 and went to Cincinnati, where
he began teaching school. Later he studied medicine, receiving
the M.D. degree when only 22. After several years of practice
he joined the faculty of Woodward High School as teacher of

174 OLD TEXTBOOKS

mathematics. The remainder of his life was devoted to teaching
and textbook writing. He, like Davies, became a proliﬁc author
of mathematics books. The Nietz Collection contains 38 copies
of Ray’s Arithmetics of diﬁerent title, date, or publisher, and
17 algebras. However, some of these were published after Ray’s
death. It has been said that Ray “did for ﬁgures what McGufTey
did for literature.” The Ray’s Arithmetics were published by the
same company that produced the McGuffey Readers.

His ﬁrst book was the Eclectic Arithmetic in 1834. Thus the
term Eclectic was used here before McGuffey’s first books were
written in 1836. About,183’7 a graded series appeared entitled
Ray’s Arithmetic, Part First; Part Second; and Part Third.
Part First was intended for very young pupils, and contained
simple lessons, illustratedwith numerous counters. Part Second
aimed to provide a “thorough course of mental arithmetic by
induction and analysis.” Part Third really was the Eclectic
Arithmetic carefully. revised. It was planned “on the inductive
and analytic methods of instruction, designed for Common
Schools, Academies, and High Schools.” These three books were
advertised to be “The Best and Cheapest Arithmetics ever Pub-
lished.” Part First sold for ten cents, Part Second for twenty
cents, and Part Third for 35 cents. Part Third contained 264:
pages of ‘very ﬁne print, and so was able to include “twice the
usual quantity of matter contained in works of this class.”

Apparently either Bay or his publishers became dissatisﬁed
with the titles of the three Parts, so in 1853 Part First became
The Child’s Arithmetic, Part Second became the M ent.al..A7”ith-
metic, and Part Third became the Practical Arithmetic. These
were enlarged revisions of the earlier books. Still not satisﬁed, in
1857 the titles of the ﬁrst two were again changed. The ﬁrst
book became Primary Lessons and Tables, and the second became
the Intellectual Arithmetic. The title of the third remained the
Practical Arithmetic. It may be that the publishers rather than
Ray made these changes and revisions, since some sources say
that Ray died in 1855 rather than 1857.

The Primary Lessons was a book of 80 pages dealing only
with the four fundamentals. Extreme care was claimed in making
the lessons “gradually and almost imperceptibly progressive.”

ARITHMETICS 175

With some revisions it was republished in 1877 as the New
Primary Arithmetic. In the meantime there apparently arose
from those using these books objections to a series of three, so
in 1879 the publishers produced a two—book series. The lower
book was entitled N ew Elementary Arithmetic, which aimed to
be sufﬁciently comprehensive as an introduction for the New
Practical Arithmetic. The two formed the series. In 1903 both
were revised and published under the title Modern Elementary
Arithmetic.

Even before 1879 the publishers produced The Rudiments of
Arithmetic (1866). Its purpose seemed to be to take the place
of the two lower books. However, this edition did not become
very popular.

The Intellectual Arithmetic (1857)   was an enlarged revision
of the Mental Arithmetic and contained 162 pages. It aimed to
present the “Exercises on the primary principles and their ap-
plications, interspersed with appropriate models of analysis and
frequent reviews.” Less emphasis was placed on the mental work.
The revised 1860 edition contained a statement on the title page
that it was the One Thou-
sandth Edition. In 1879 it was
again revised into a somewhat
simpler and briefer book.

In 1858 Part Third ap-
peared under a supplementary
title of Practical Arithmetic.
In 1857 it was revised and
printed in a more attractive
form. This was its One Thou-
sandth Edition. In 1877 it was
again rather thoroughly re-
vised and printed in even
more attractive form. Too,
the presentation of many top-

176 OLD TEXTBOOKS

ics was rearranged, and several topics totally eliminated. Among
those dropped were aliquots, alligation medial, du-odecimals, per-
mutation, and gauging. In 1903 still another revision was made
and the title became Ray’s Modern Practical Arithmetic. The
revision provided for an enrichment of some topics, as practical
measurements, bills and accounts, etc., and an abridgment of
others of waning importance. Likely, more copies of the Practical
Arithmetic were sold than of any American arithmetic before
1900.

In 1856 the publishers produced an advanced arithmetic with
a double title; namely, Ray’s Higher Arithmetic, and Principles
of Arithmetic. This book was planned and begun by Ray, but
due to illness he was unable to ﬁnish it. So the editor of the
publishers, Charles E. Mathews, finished it in consultation with
Ray. This became a Well—known and widely used book for many

decades, popularly known as Ray’s Higher. It was revised and
made more attractive in 1880. Its list of 10-6 “Miscellaneous
Exercises” at the end of the book constituted the challenge to

, anyone considered competent in arithmetic. In fact, some of

the problems could not be solved without some understanding of
certain principles of algebra and geometry.
The publishers of the Ray’s Arithmetics deserve great credit

I for the frequent and well—planned revisions of these arithmetics,

for many of these revisions were made long after Ray’s decease.
They did for these arithmetics exactly what they had done for
the McGufTey Readers in revising them to meet the criticisms
and the needs of the changing times. As a result the books en-
joyed a wide usage for nearly a century. It has been claimed

that about 120,000,000 copies have been sold.

Benjamin Greenleaf (1786-1864). He was a graduate from Dart-
mouth College, and later served as principal of several New
England academies. While principal of Bradford Academy, he
also conducted a teachers’ seminary. In addition to being the
author of numerous arithmetics, he also wrote several algebras.
His first arithmetics were the Introduction to the N ational Arith-
metic, and the National Arithmetic (1835).

Although the Introduction was the lower of the two books, it
was a book of considerable size. This book was somewhat revised
and recopyrighted in 18492, 1848, and 1856, and renewed in
1870. Interestingly, the covers of the later editions used the
title Common School Arithmetic, but the title page continued to
use Introduction to the National Arithmetic. Some of the claims
for the book were the use of simple, precise, and accurate deﬁni-
tions; its practical character; reasons for the operations ex-
plained; and the abridging of the operations applicable to busi-
ness transactions. Problems of alligation, permutation, involution,
and evolution were still in the 1881 edition.

The National Arithmetic followed the “inductive system; com-
bining the analytic and synthetic methods, in which the principles
of arithmetic are explained in a perspicuous and familiar man-

ner; containing also practical systems of mensuration, gauging,

and bookkeeping; forming a complete mercantile arithmetic.”

1'78 OLD TEXTBOOKS

This description appeared on the title page. Each phase of arith-
metic was introduced by several easy exercises and demonstrated
by example, followed by the proper rule printed in italics. Pro-
gressive exercises followed. It was recopyrighted in 1836, 1847,
1857, and 1863. The last two editions were much larger than the
earlier ones.

Apparently Greenleaf soon realized that the Introduction was
too difficult as a beginning book, for in 1845 he published the
Primary Arithmetic. This was the title on the outside cover. On
the title page it was the Mental Arithmetic, upon the Inductive
Plan, designed for primary and intermediate schools. It was re-
vised in 1851. In 1857 it appeared as the New Primary Arithme-
tic. This same title appeared both on the outside cover and the
title page. These primary books completed a series of three.

In 1851 Greenleaf added a fourth to the series, the New
Intellectual Arithmetic to be used between the Primary and the
Common School Arithmetic. It was revised and recopyrighted in
1857 and 1863.

After Greenleaf’s death the publishers produced a new series
of four; namely, the New Primary, New Elementary, New In-
tellectual, and New Practical. They suggested that the first two
were excellent for ungraded schools. Other combinations were sug-
gested for other types of schools. However, they were known as
Greenleaf’s Arithmetics.

James B. Thomson. In 1845 Thomson produced the Practical
Arithmetic. He must have been very pedagogically conscious, for
he used four pages to describe the characteristics of the book, and
then presented a long list of suggestions on the teaching of
arithmetic. The procedure followed in the book was first to pre-
sent by analysis and solution a number of practical examples in-
volving a rule. The operation was then deﬁned and each principle
analyzed. The general rule was then to be deduced, thus combin-
ing the inductive and synthetic modes of instruction. In the back
of the book there were recommendations by 26 persons. The book
was revised in 1853 and reprinted often thereafter until the
1870%.

In 1846 he published the Mental Arithmetic, or First Lessons

ARITHMETICS 179

in Numbers. The 1852 printing of this book was the 73rd edition.
The deﬁnitive parts of the book were catechetical in form. In
1872 it was revised as the New Mental Arithmetic. In 1853 the
Rudiments of Arithmetic was published as a supplementary book

I to the Mental. In 187 2 it became the N ew Rudiments.

In 1847 the Higher Arithmetic appeared. This completed the
series of three. The approach was the same as in the Practical,

. but it contained more difficult problems and more exercises re-

lating to business matters. It went through numerous reprintings.

Much later a new two-book series was published. In 1878 A
Complete Intellectual Arithmetic, and in 1882 the Complete
Graded Arithmetic were published. Apparently this was done, as
was common practice by publishers, to cash in on the established
reputation of a well-known author of arithmetics.

John F. Stoddard (1825-1873). After graduating from the
Albany State Normal School, he taught district schools in New
York. Soon he gravitated to Pennsylvania, where he conducted
private teacher training work. Later he was principal of a
school in New York City.

He wrote the Juvenile Mental Arithmetic in 1849. This was
an attractive little book of 71 pages. It taught the fundamentals
by means of combination exercises, inductively, without the use
of the tables in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
However, surprisingly for such a small book, it contained the
tables of coinage, troy weight, apothecaries weight, avoirdupois
weight, cloth measure, long measure, land measure, cubic measure,
wine measure, table of time, table of paper, table of books, and
the aliquot parts of the year.

Also in 1849 he wrote the American Intellectual Arithmetic to
follow the Juvenile. It was more than twice the size of the
Juvenile. Slight revisions were made in it in 1860 and 1866. In
1889 it became the N ew Intellectual Arithmetic. All of these
editions contained a list of puzzle problems in the back. The
publishers claimed in 1852 that the Intellectual was used in
“many of the Public and Private Schools and Academies of New
York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Missouri, and is used
extensively in the Schools of New England.”

180 OLD TEXTBOOKS

In 1852 the Practical Arithmetic was published. The preface
said that “useless theories, or a long list of arithmetical curi-
osities” would be avoided. Rather the fundamental principles of
the “Science of Numbers” would be presented, as employed in
everyday business. It was a much larger and more diﬂicult book
than the other two. In 1865 it was enlarged and became the N ew
Practical Arithmetic. It was again enlarged in 1868. At the end
of the book many questions for examination and review Were
included. The 1868 edition still had a section on bookkeeping.

Also in 1852 Stoddard prepared the Complete Arithmetic. In
the 1868 edition the first 303 pages were identical with those in
the New Practical. The next 113 pages involved more difficult
applications of the same types of problems of the earlier part,
plus many new matters, such as circulating decimals, continued

Stoddard, Mental Arithmetic; many early arithmetics stressed mental work.

ARITHMETICS 181

fractions, metric denominations, temperature, life insurance, and
mariner’s measure. The title Complete was apropos.

Ultimately, in 1853, he wrote the American Philosophical
Arithmetic, designed for advanced classes. In it he attempted to

8 “present clearly and concisely, all those important principles and

properties of numbers, which are necessary to a full comprehen-
sion of the higher branches of Mathematics, and their application
to practical business and scientiﬁc calculations.” In the back 143
miscellaneous problems appeared. All of these books had numer-
ous printings.

Others. Arithmetics by many authors were written between 1820
and 1850. The books of only eight of these authors have been
discussed. Bare mention may be made of several others whose
books did go through several printings. In 1825 Thomas Smiley
wrote the N ew Federal Calculator; or, Scholar’s Assistant, which
appeared in a number of editions. In 1829 John Rose published
The Science of Arithmetic, and later two other arithmetics. In
1844 George R. Perkins wrote a Higher Arithmetic, later An
Elementary Arithmetic, and a Practical Arithmetic. In 184:7
Horatio N. Robinson published The American Arithmetic, and
later a series of Progressive Arithmetics. Later these were revised
by Fish. None of these attained the wide usage of those by the
eight authors discussed above.

ARITHMETICS, 1850-1900

Fewer authors will be discussed for these fifty years than for
the previous thirty years. Although the writer’s collection con-
tains arithmetics written by sixty difterent authors during this
period, only the books of about a half dozen gained much popu-
larity, at least before 1900. Of course, it should be kept in mind
in discussing the arithmetics of this period that the later editions,
and even new editions by the authors of the 1820-1850 period
continued to appear, some even to and after 1900, such as the

books by Ray.

Edward Brooks (1831—?). Brooks was born in New York

State, but soon moved to Pennsylvania. There he became

182 OLD TEXTBOOKS

associated with Millersville State Normal School, the ﬁrst one in
the state. From 1866 to 1883 he was its principal. From the time
he first taught there, he began to write textbooks. Most of these
were in the ﬁeld of arithmetic, but he also wrote a geometry, an
algebra, several methods books, and one on mental science (psy-
chology). In the ﬁeld of arithmetic his production was proliﬁc. He
began to publish the series of Normal Arithmetics in 1858. The
writer’s collection contains 30 copies of different dates under nine
titles, one as late as 1908. It may be well to list these and then to
discuss them in general. They were as follows:

Titles Copyright and Revision Dates
Normal Primary Arithmetic 1858, 1878
Normal Mental Arithmetic 1858, 1863, 1873, 1908
Normal Elementary Arithmetic 1865, 1888
Normal Written Arithmetic 1863, 1877
Normal Higher Arithmetic 1877
Normal Union Arithmetic 1877
Normal Standard Arithmetic 1895
Key to Normal Mental Arithmetic 1860, 1873
Key to Normal Written Arithmetic 1863.

There may have been other editions not known to the writer.
Nearly all of these went through numerous printings of different
dates. The titles of the later editions were preceded by the word
N en). The first ﬁve books listed above apparently were meant to
form a graded series. The other two were written later, each of
which could be purchased as a book Complete, or in Part I, II,
or III as a graded series.

Brooks was definitely pedagogically conscious when he wrote
these books. For example, in the preface of the Normal Primary
he carefully explained the features. Then followed eight pages
in ﬁne print of suggestions and directions for teaching it. Oral
and written exercises were to be combined, and addition and sub-
traction were to be taught simultaneously——“the process of sub-
traction thus being derived as a result of addition.” Only the four
fundamental processes were included in this book. 1

The Normal Mental followed the Primary. It was a book of
188 pages of rather ﬁne print consisting entirely of mental ex-
ercises. No tables were included. The process was by “analysis

ARITHMETICS 183

and induction.” The purpose of the Normal Elementary was “to
furnish young pupils with an introductory course of Written
Arithmetic, realizing the necessity of such a course in connection
with the Mental Ea'ercises.” This book was more like other
arithmetics, including tables of coinage, weight, and measures
commonly taught in those days. However, it was not very large.
The different editions varied from 185 to 215 pages. y

The next book was the Normal Written Arithmetic, which was
a much more advanced book. The 1863 edition had 328 pages,
and the 1877 edition 4&1. This book followed the deductive ap—
proach. For example, the Reduction of US. Money was presented
as follows: First, a statement deﬁning reduction; next, the listing
in italics of ﬁve rules or principles; and last, 18 examples for
practice. A list of 135 miscellaneous problems appeared at the
end of the book. p p

The last in the Normal series was the ormal Higher (1877).
It was intended for use mainly in high schools, academies,
and normal schools. As an advanced book its object was “to pre-
sent a scientific treatise upon the science of numbers.” It was
further stated that formerly arithmetic was treated more as an
art and a drill subject without developing conceptions of the
“interesting relations of the science and the simplicity of its
reasoning process.” About 140 pages were devoted to varied and
detailed problems involving percentage. One advanced section
dealt with the “Properties of Numbers.” T

The Normal Un-ion appearing in 1877 was nearly identical
to the Normal Written, but could be bought as Part I, Part II;
and Part III. Thus it really constituted an additional series, thus
giving schools a choice of series. Then in 1895 the Normal
Standard was copyrighted. About three—fourths of it was like the
Normal Union. The last part of the book was rearranged. It
could also be bought in Parts as a series.

It must be clear by now that Brooks attempted to have his
books or series of books meet the needs of any kind of school
or school system. A number of these contained statements on the
inside covers concerning the adoptions of these arithmetics by
various school districts. It is clear that their circulation continued
for more than a half century.

184 OLD TEXTBOOKS

Daniel W. Fish. The earliest arithmetics written, rather edited,
by Fish constituted the Progressive Series. He apparently had
some tie up with Horatio Robinson, who had become known as
a leading mathematician and author of popular algebras, geom-
etries, and an astronomy textbook. Most of Fish’s books were
acknowledged to belong to the Robinson’s Mathematical Series.

The Progressive Series consisted of four books; the first three
were first published in 1858. The first of these was the Progressive
Primary Arithmetic. It was a very attractive little book contain-
ing a number of illustrative pictures. The first two pages were
catechetical in form, followed by two pages of numbers in written
form, printed ﬁgures, written numbers, and Roman letters. The
remainder of the book consisted mostly of inductive exercises
interspersed with complete analyses of model examples. Seven
pages presented tables of coinage, weights, and measures. It was
recopyrighted in 1863.

The second book was the Progressive Intellectual Arithmetic.
It also was written on the inductive approach. It introduced the
tables of coinage, weights, and measures on page 428. These were
followed by '70 pages of problems involving them. Except for
some miscellaneous problems at the end, the remainder of the
book dealt rather extensively with percentage. It also was recopy—
righted in 1863.

The third book was the Progressive Practical Arithmetic. It
claimed to contain the “theory of numbers, in connection with
concise analytic and synthetic methods of solution, and designed
as a complete textbook.” Like many other so—called complete
arithmetics, it began with the fundamentals and ended with the
diflicult phases of arithmetic, such as the roots, difficult problems
of percentage, and alligation. It was very similar to other arith-
metics of the period. It went through numerous reprintings.

The fourth book was the Progressive Higher Arithmetic. This
was the same title as one published by Robinson. In fact, they
were virtually identical except the one edited by Fish contained
many more problems dealing with mensuration. It was copy-
righted in 1860, 1863, and 1875. The writer has not succeeded
in determining the working and financial arrangement Fish had
with Robinson in this series. Apparently Fish wrote the first three

ARITHMETICS 185

in consultation with Robinson and then merely added a little to
Robinson’s Higher.

Also in 1858 Fish published the Rudiments of Written
Arithmetic, “containing slate and black—board exercises for be-
ginners.” This book was not a part of a graded series, but likely
could have been used to serve in place both of the Primary, and
the Intellectual of the above series. Its approach was not as in-
ductive as the other two.

Then in 1874:, after Robinson’s decease, Fish published a new
two—book series, a First Book in Arithmetic, including both oral
and written exercises, and the Complete Arithmetic. Thus the
work could be purchased in two parts or all in a single volume.
The approach was developmental. Deﬁnitions, rules and expla-
nations, and analyses accompanied or were interspersed with the
problems. The Complete book went through numerous printings.

Ultimately, in 1888 Fish wrote a new two—book series; namely,
Fish’s Arithmetic: Number One and Number Two. Number One
was prepared as the “ﬁrst book in arithmetic for pupils com-
mencing the third school year.” Some “unique” features claimed
for the book were: “Countings, Groupings, Signs, Drill Tables
for abstract and Concrete work,” etc. The ﬁrst 140 pages dealt
with the fundamentals, and the last thirty with measurements,
percentage, and review. Although the next book was entitled
Number Two, it really was a complete arithmetic, but not as
large as the 1874 Complete Arithmetic. Too, its approach was
more inductive than the 1874 edition. Fish, as was true of Brooks
and others, apparently aimed to have arithmetic books suitable
for the various kinds and systems of schools——graded, loosely
graded, and ungraded.

Philotus Dean. Dean was connected with the public schools of
Pittsburgh. Seeing the success -of the locally printed Osgood
Readers, apparently he thought there might be a market for some
Pittsburgh printed arithmetics. His first one, in 1859, was the
Public School Arithmetic. It really was a complete arithmetic,
since it covered all of the commonly accepted aspects of the field.
The next year he wrote the Primary Arithmetic as part of a
series. It was well illustrated and largely inductive in approach.

186 OLD TEXTBOOKS

It combined the mental with work for the slate and blackboard.
It covered the four fundamentals, fractions, and twelve pages of
problems in connection with certain tables.

The Intellectual Arithmetic was planned to follow the Primary.
This book appeared in rather ﬁne print and was much more diffi-
cult than the Primary. Analyses interspersed the problems. In
1865 he added the Intermediate Arithmetic to his list. This was
very similar to his earlier Public School Arithmetic, and con-
tained “all matter usually presented in a practical arithmetic, so
simpliﬁed as to adapt it to beginners; with the most approved
models and analyses.” In 1868 he published the Elementary
Arithmetic for schools having pupils dropping out when rather

young. So in a simple way it presented nearly all of the more

important aspects of arithmetic. Lastly in 1874 he wrote the
High School Arithmetic, containing the matter commonly con-
tained in higher arithmetics, of which there had been many writ-
ten. It is doubtful whether these books attained very wide usage
beyond the western Pennsylvania area. ‘  

John H. French. In 1867 a carefully graded series of four
arithmetics written by French began to appear. The first one
was a very simple book entitled First Lessons in Numbers, ap-
parently to be used mostly for oral work with very young chil-
dren. The second one was the Elementary Arithmetic, For the
Slate. This book was designed for beginners in written arithme-
tic. It contained six chapters: Integers, Decimals, Compound
Numbers, Fractions, Percentage, and Miscellaneous Review Prob-
lems. The title page contained the following statement in ﬁne
italic print: “If Principles are understood, Rules are useless.”
This meant that the book was arranged inductively. It contained
many pictures which were carefully used to introduce or illustrate
various types of arithmetical applications. The problems were of
a very practical nature. The back of the book included a Manual
of Methods and Suggestions of 12 pages in ﬁne print. Most of it

was devoted to suggestions regarding the work on speciﬁc pages

in the book. _
The third was the Mental Arithmetic. It referred to mental
arithmetic as the “Logic of the Common School.” It is not clear

ARITHMETICS 187

whether French meant this to be used after the Elementary
Arithmetic or supplementary to it. In the Publishers’ Notice it
was listed as the third book, yet it was smaller and simpler than

the Elementary. Evidence indicates that not as many copies and

printings of this book Were sold as of the others.

The fourth book entitled Common School Arithmetic appeared
in 1869. The statement, “If the Understanding is thoroughly
reached, the Memory will take care of itself,” appeared on the

title page. It was 116 pages larger than the elementary. More than a

two—thirds of the book was devoted to various kinds of tables, per-
centage, and mensuration, together with pictures, diagrams, and
practical problems relating to these matters. All of these books
were very attractively printed. The Elementary and the Common
School A-rithmetics appeared in numerous printings.

Emerson E. White (1829-1902). He was a leading mid-West
educator during the latter half of the nineteenth century. He was
one of the organizers of the National Educational Association
and its president in 1872. The three most important positions
held by him were Superin-
tendent of schools at Cincin-
nati, state Superintendent of
Public Instruction of Ohio,
and President of Purdue Uni-
versity. He also was the au-
thor of a popular book on
methods and one on school
management.

The publication of White’s
graded series of three arith-
metics began in 1868. These
were published by the same
company that published the
McGuiTey Readers. The first

one was A Primary Arithme-

tic, which united oral and written exercises in “a natural sys-
tem of instruction.” It covered only the four fundamentals of
arithmetic, but contained none of their tables. The combinations
were to be learned through exercises, which were profusely il-
lustrated with many kinds of pictures.

The second book was An Intermediate Arithmetic. More than
a third of the book was devoted to reviewing the fundamentals,
after which it dealt with Properties of Numbers, Common Frac-
tions, United States Money, Reduction of Denominate Numbers
(dealing with the various tables of weights and measures), and
Compound Numbers. Like the Primary book, it was attractively
arranged and illustrated with some pictures and diagrams. The
answers to the exercises were in the back of the book. It was
slightly revised several times.

The third book was A Complete Arithmetic. In addition to
dealing with the topics covered in the Intermediate, this book
dealt with the metric system, ratio and proportion, involution
and evolution, and in the Appendix with geometrical progression,
alligation, and permutations. Much space was given to per-
centage, but very little to problems involving weights and meas-
ures. It was copyrighted in 1870, 1883, 1897, and 1901. Thus it
was in use for more than three decades.

Later it became evident to White and to the publishers that
many schools and parents objected to buying three arithmetics.
So in 1883 he wrote A New Elementary Arithmetic. This in-
cluded the material of both the Primary and the Intermediate,
and with the Complete made a two book series. It is evident that
White’s books, together with the Ray’s Arithmetics, went a long
way to ﬁll the arithmetic needs of the mid-west during the second
half of the nineteenth century.

Milton B. Goff. At the time of the writing of his first arithmetics
Goff was professor of mathematics at the Western University of
Pennsylvania (now the University of Pittsburgh). Later he be-
came its president, the only professor there ever to have become
its head.

In 1876 there was published in Pittsburgh Goff’s First Book in
Arithmetic. It was a very attractive book of 1454 pages profusely

illustrated. Evidently both Goff and White were cognizant of the
inﬂuence of the Oswego Object Lesson movement, which empha-
sized the use of objects and pictures. Two—thirds of the book dealt

V with the four fundamentals, and the remainder dealt with frac-

tions, and denominate numbers as related to the tables of coinage,
Weights, and measures. The fundamentals were taught in a sort
of cycle method. First they were presented in a modiﬁed table
form with very simple exercises, and then later with much more
diflicult exercises involving them. In the back of the book there
were six pages in ﬁne print of Suggestions to Teachers. ,
Also in 187 6 The Complete Arithmetic was published in Pitts-
burgh, as well as in New York, Boston, and Omaha. This was a
rather large book of 4152 pages to follow the First Book. In
defense Goff held that “too many books have been used and too
much time has been spent in the study of Arithmetic.” He believed
that the sole use of a mental arithmetic was unnecessary. Mental
work should have rather close connection with written arithmetic.
The contents of the book were very similar to other complete
arithmetics of that period. The approach was largely deductive
rather than inductive as was true of some other competing

arithmetics. In 1877 he published A Book of Arithmetical Prob-

lems designed for use by teachers and pupils as a drill book in

connection with the Complete Arithmetic. It could also be used

by pupils who desired to study advanced work. Answers ac-
companied the problems.

In 1888 the First Book was replaced by a considerably larger
one entitled Elementary Arithmetic. Again the cycle plan was
used to present the fundamentals. Apparently the ﬁrst presen-
tation of them was for one grade and the second for the next
grade. The Second had fewer illustrations and was less attractive
than the earlier book. In 1889 Goff’s Practical Arithmetic re-
placed the Complete and was 50 pages smaller. The two chief
changes were that fractions were omitted, since these were pre-
sented in the Elementary book, and treatment of the metric
system was introduced.

G. A. Wentworth (1835-1906). The last series of arithmetics to
be discussed in this chapter was written by Wentworth. After he

192 3 OLD TEXTBOOKS

was graduated from Harvard he taught mathematics at Phillips
Exeter Academy for thirty years. Then he resigned to give full
time to textbook writing. Previous to his authorship of an
arithmetic he had Written a very popular geometry- One of his
algebras appeared the same year as his ﬁrst arithmetic. One year
later a trigonometry appeared. In all of these fields he wrote more
than one text.

His ﬁrst arithmetic was A Practical Arithmetic written in
1881 jointly with the Rev. Thomas Hill, ex—president of Har-
vard. It soon appeared in a number of printings, including one
in 1893, when an identical printing was entitled A High School
Arithmetic. Interestingly these books had an index and seven
pages of deﬁnitions of mathematical terms in the beginning of
each book. Its contents were very similar to other arithmetics
commonly known as “complete,” beginning with the fundamentals
followed by the topics then generally taught. Undue attention

seemingly was paid to metric measures in 36 pages of text, and  

ﬁfteen pages to logarithms. Otherwise the problems seemed to be
very practical. The book was considerably revised and recopy—
righted in 1893 and again in 1897. Some topics were dropped,
others rearranged, and the treatment of some enlarged. These
editions appeared under Wentworth’s authorship alone. In 1886
Wentworth and Hill also published an Exercise Manual.

In 1885 Wentworth and E. M. Reed wrote the First Steps in
Numbers: A Primary Arithmetic. It contained no pictures and
was unattractive. In some respects it took the form of a work-
book, in that many of the lessons were headed by such directions
as, “Copy and complete,” “Copy and ﬁnd the answers,” “Copy
and complete with ﬁgures,” etc. In 1889 the same authors re-
placed it with the Primary Arithmetic. This book was very
different. It contained many counters and pictures, and largely
used the inductive or developmental approach. It soon ap-
peared in several printings. In 1893 this book was replaced by
An Elementary Arithmetic written by Wentworth alone. Thus
two arithmetics which were co—authored originally were replaced
by books written by Wentworth alone. In 1895 Wentworth wrote
A Mental Arithmetic of 190 pages, apparently to be used in
schools stressing mental exercises. However, it did not become

ARITHMETICS 193

popular. The popularity of the mental arithmetic approach had
passed.

In 1889 A Grammar School Arithmetic appeared, which was
a shortened revision of the Practical with the approach less de-

ductive. Some of the sections resembled the Work~book approach.

The popular sale of these two books apparently paralleled each
other, one taking a somewhat deductive and the other a more
developmental approach. In 1898 Wentworth published An
Advanced Aréthm-etic for high schools, normal schools, and
academies. All of these appeared in numerous printings.

It is evident that Wentwortli was the author of very widely
used mathematics books at the turn of the century, not only in
the ﬁeld of arithmetic, but also in algebra, geometry, and trigo-
nometry. Like the publishers of the Ray’s books earlier, so the
publishers of Wentworth’s books aimed to have frequent re-
visions and reprintings. 0

COMMENTS

The basic treatment in this chapter has dealt only with the
American arithmetics published before 1900. While the writer
has made no detailed analysis of arithmetics published since 1900,
certain comparative comments may be appropriate. Many of the
changes are evidently due to a better understanding of children
psychologically. In other words, the approaches are more psy-
chological.

One of the most marked contrasts between the arithmetics be-
fore and after 1900 would be in the make—up of the book. The
modern books are much larger; are printed with very much
larger type; and contain many more pictures, which often are
colored. The books are more appealing and attractive.

Modern arithmetics are graded much more ﬁnely. This is true
in several respects. In some series there is a separate book for
every grade. Then, also, the vocabulary and the concepts involved
in these books are more carefully graded according to the ma-
turity of the children.

Most current arithmetics are mathematically more meaningful
and socially signiﬁcant. More attention is given to the meaning

194: OLD TEXTBOOKS

and origin of numbers and the number system. Often the work
is organized in units dealing with important aspects of life and
society. The social and practical applications are given more
attention.

In conclusion, it can be said that American arithmetic text-
books have markedly improved in appearance, grading and
gradation, content, inclusion of learning and teaching aids, and
their signiﬁcance to the life and thinking of the children using
them.

CHAPTER 6

GEOGRAPHIES
AN OLD STUDY

GEOGRAPHY is an old subject ﬁeld. One of the first to systema-
tize geography as a subject was Hecataeus of Miletus, who
lived before 500 B.C., and is often called the Father of Geogra-
phy.Other ancient writers of geography were Herodotus, Strabo,
Polybius, Pliny, Ptolemy, Dionysius, and Pausanias; all wrote
in Greek. As was true of other academic subjects, schools paid
little attention to geography during the Middle Ages.

Geographical knowledge spread rapidly during the Renais-
sance, for two reasons. First, many of the ancient writings were
rediscovered and the invention of the printing press made publi-
cation possible. Some of the old writings were translated even into
the modern vernacular languages. Second, the invention of the
compass and the astrolabe made it safe for mariners to go beyond
sight of land in their travels and explorations. As a result, the
Americas and new parts of the world were discovered and ex-
plored. Soon books and pamphlets were written about them, and
the knowledge of geography and map making was greatly ‘ex-
panded. g

It was inevitable with the Revival of Learning during the
Renaissance and the expanding of knowledge, that the study of
geography ‘should become a school ‘subject. From geography

195

196 OLD TEXTBOOKS

have come history, geology, and in part, some other sciences as
school subjects of today. Geography is the mother of many
other sub ects.

AIMS OF EARLY GEOGRAPHY TEX TBOOKS

It has been the practice for textbook authors to state the aims
which a study of their books should fulﬁll. These were usually
in the preface, or sometimes in the introduction. All authors did
not hold the same views regarding the aims of geography. An
analysis of their aims shows that there seemed to be two reasons
why the authors differed. First, the personal views of the authors
would vary. Secondly, the aims themselves changed somewhat
with the period or time.

Cultural aims. From the appearance of the earliest books to the
present, the cultural values of the study of geography have been
recognized. These values have been expressed in various ways.

1. Acquisition of Knowl-
edge. Morse, in 1784.4, stated
that the “more immediate aim
is to facilitate the acquisition
of geographical knowledge.”
John Smith’s A New Com-
pend of Geography (1816)
began his Preface by saying,
“The diffusion of knowledge,
in republican forms of gov-
ernment, is of vital impor-
tance.” Huntington’s book
(1885) stated that nobler
achievements can be attained
“if their minds were, in due
reason, cultivated and en-
larged by an acquaintance
with the state of the world.”

GEOGRAPHIES 197

The Poetical Geography, 1863, emphasizing the pleasure of learning.

198 OLD TEXTBOOKS

One of the most popular series in geography was written by S. S.
Cornell. In his Primary Geography in 1854 he said, in urging the
adoption of the book, “First, that it will endow a pupil with a
thorough and permanent knowledge of Geography.” In Guyot’s
Primary Geography (1866) one ﬁnds a more modern statement
in regard to acquiring knowledge: “The object of this little book
is not so much to impart geographical knowledge, as to prepare
the pupil for its successive acquiremem‘ in the future.” And in a
still later book, in Harper’s School Geography in 187 5, one finds
an even broader purpose expressed in claiming that “The study
of geography is now, much more than at any former period, an
essential element in education. It is second in importance only to
reading, writing, and rudimentary arithmetic.” Thus, the acqui-
sition of knowledge, both in its narrower as well as in its broader
aspects, was certainly an aim in teaching geography.

2. Interest and Entertainment. Another cultural element
claimedfor geography was that it was interesting and enjoyable
on a higher level. Huntington’s text said that geography was “a
source of mental diversion and entertainment,” and that it “ex-
cites a continually increasing interest.” This value of geography
was mentioned in various ways by many authors, but the author
who extended himself most by attempting to publish a book with
this purpose foremost in mind was George Van Waters. In his
Poetical Geography, in 1863, he wrote the entire text in poetical
form, He claimed that he “spared neither time nor labor to make
it useful and interesting.” A few brief examples from the book
may be of interest:

The surface of the Earth, with all its tribes,
Of -sea and land, Geography describes.

This Earth is but a mighty ball profound,
Just ﬁve and twenty thousand miles around.

In Mexico, high on table lands,

In the interior of the province stands,

Above the sea full seven thousand feet,
Adorned with temples rich and structures great.

Civic aim, Another major aim mentioned by many authors was to

199

GEOGRAPHIES

200 OLD TEXTBOOKS

develop either nationalism or worldmindedness. These purposes
were stressed more fully in the earlier books than in the later
ones. This was because the early geographies contained content
now classed as history and even civics. These early texts really
constituted correlated social studies. Later, history and civics
became separate sub ect ﬁelds.

A mild form of nationalistic spirit was expressed in the 1800
edition of Morse’s Geography Made Easy: “our youth have been
educated, rather as subjects of the British king, than as citizens
of a free and independent Republic. But the scene is now changed

. . particularly to that of the Geography of our own country.”

As history and civil government later became separate subject

A ﬁelds the civic aim continued for some time, but began to stress

more fully the world view. Huntington in 1835 said, “of many
parts of the world we are still extremely ignorant. They are
yet to be explored,” and as they are explored “new degrees of
light are afforded.” As late as 1872 Monteith in his Comprehen-
sive Geography said, in justifying some history with geography,
“One leading feature is that the student learns all about one
country or state at one time.” After 1880 geography books ﬁnally
discontinued the use of history as one of their aims.

Relationships. The earlier authors rarely interpreted the facts
presented in their books in relationship to each other. The content
of most early geographies consisted of a body of unrelated facts
concerning the world and its peoples. The correlation of facts was
overlooked. The first one to begin showing such relationships in
geography was Carl Ritter, a German geographer, although he
did not carry the idea systematically to all aspects of the subject.

The ﬁrst American geography author to develop this idea
most fully in his books was Arnold Guyot. Although his texts
were published in a number of editions, particularly his Earth
and Man (1849 and later), yet they were not as popular as
Mitchell’s geographies during the same period, nor did other
authors at that time commonly follow the practice of showing
relationships. However, that is the common practice today. Guyot
was ahead of his time.

The idea was to connect cause and effect. An attempt was

GEOGRAPHIES 201

made to set up natural to natural, natural to cultural, and cul-
tural to cultural relationships. Appleton’s Standard Higher
Geography (1881) favored developing relationships, so that
“these facts will be readily remembered, if the reasons underlying
them are properly comprehended.” Intelligence as well as memory
were to be developed. Items of location and occurrence were to be
studied in relationship rather than as isolated parts.

Tewtbooks aims. In addition to the aims set forth for the study
of geography, most authors also claimed certain aims for their
particular texts in comparison with others.

1. Provision for individual differences. One of the first authors
to try to adapt the content to the student’s ability was Daniel
Adams (1818). He divided his book into three parts for the
different abilities of students. The next step in this development
was to publish geographies in series. One of the first primary
geographies was written by Emma Willard in 1826, entitled
Geography for Beginners. Although a number of early authors
wrote more than one textbook in geography, yet none wrote a
graded series before 1850. One of the first graded series to be
written by one author was by S. S. Cornell in 1854. On the title
page of her Primary Geography appeared the following quo-
tation: “First the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in
the ear.” She proposed to give children “one thing at a time” and
“to render this important branch as palpable to the understand-
ing of pupils as some of the other branches of their education.”
No doubt she knew that in reading, spelling, arithmetic, and some
other branches the books had appeared in graded series beginning
in the early 1830’s. After the Cornell series was published, most
geographies appeared in series, some in a two—book series, and
others in three. Other leading series were by Monteith, Mitchell,
Guyot, Colton, Fitch, Goodrich, and Swinton.

2. Time—saving. Some authors wrote brief, concise books which
they claimed would be time—saving. An illustration of such claim

was found in Monteith’s Comprehensive Geography (18792) :

Owing to the limited time, which many scholars can give to the
study of Geography, the author has endeavored to secure satisfactory

202 OLD‘ TEXTBOOKS

results at the smallest possible expense in time and labor, both to the
teacher and pupil. '

Guyot (1875) stated that even though his book was small, it pro-
vided “a complete thorough and symmetrical summary of ge-
ographical knowledge.” Other similar statements could be quoted.

3. Improvement of content. It is to be expected that many
authors should claim, as their books were published, that the
content of such books represented a great improvement over the
other books on the market. For example, Augustus S. Mitchell,
whose books later appeared in more editions than those of any
other geography author, said in A System of Modern Geogra-
phy (1840) :

Geography is, more than any other science, in its nature con-
stantly progressive; and, hence, demands increasing diligence on the
part of those whose attention is directed to the publication of works
connected with it.

He added, “Several (authors) fail in representing various parts
of the world,” and “important misstatements have been also ob-
served in some of the works alluded to.” Roswell C. Smith in his
Introductory Geography (1850) said, “if he did not think it
(the book) better, he would certainly suppress it.” Similar claims
for their books continued to appear in the geographies of many
authors.

PRESENTATION AND NATURE OF CONTENT

No common practice was developed by geography authors in
regard to the organization and presentation of their content.
Sahlil found that seven different plans of organization were
followed in the geographies ‘published before 1840; divisions,
chapters, topics, sections, lessons, parts, and lectures. Some used
two or more plans in the same book. Thirty-threeof the  books
analyzed divided the content into divisions and 39 used sections.
Of these, three organized their content into divisions only, nine

into sections only, and 29 used a combination of divisions and
sections. The divisions most commonly used and the average per-
centage of content devoted to each were as follows: general ge-
ography, 15.5 per cent; United States, 28.8 per cent; other
North American countries, 9.4 per cent; South America, 6.4
per cent; Europe, 20.7 per cent; iAsia, 10.9 per cent; Africa,
6.7 per cent; and Australia, 1.6 per cent. However, the per-
centage of space given to the different divisions varied greatly
from book to book. For example, Jacob Willetts in An Easy
Grammar of Geography (1826) devoted 44.7 per cent to general
geography, and five of the 49 authors devoted none. Similar

. differences of emphases appear regarding the space devoted to

the other six divisions.

Ned Culler,2 who analyzed 97 geographies published between
1840 and 1890, found 10 different plans or combinations of plans
followed in presenting the materials. Even by 1890 no common
practice was followed. He, too, determined the average amount of
content devoted to the different geographical content divisions.
The averages varied considerably from those found by Sahli
before 1840. Culler’s averages were: general geography, 40.1 per
cent; United States, 29.8 per cent; other North American
countries, 6.2 per cent; South America, 4.5 per cent; Europe,
8.4 per cent; Asia, 5.5 per cent; Africa, 3.7 per cent; and
Australia, 1.9 per cent. It should be observed that the books
before 1840 devoted only 15.5 per cent of the space to general
geography, while those from 1840 to 1890 averaged 40.1 per
cent. The space given to the United States and to Australia re-
mained rather constant. The space devoted to all of the other
divisions was decreased, particularly European space dropped
from 20.7 per cent to 8.4 per cent, and Asia from 10.9 per cent
to 5.5 per cent.

SIZE OF BOOKS

No aspect or characteristic of geography books from the earlier

2 Ned Culler, “The Development of American Geography Textbooks from 1840
to 1890.” (Unpublished Ed.D. dissertation, University of Pittsburgh, 1945.)

GEOGRAPHIES 205

to the later ones changed more than the size. The 49 books
analyzed by Sahli (those before 184:0) averaged 4.4.8 X 6.5 inches
or 28.9 sq. in. On the other hand, Culler found that the average
size of those published during the 1841O’s were 39 sq. in.; during
the 1850’s, 73.2 sq. in.; during the 1860’s, 72.2 sq. in.; during
the 18'70’s, 91.3 sq. in.; and during the 1880’s, 98 sq. in. Thus
the geographies of the 1880’s were more than three times as
large as those published before 1840. There were two rather
deﬁnite reasons why these texts increased in size. First, the size
of type in the earlier books was Very small. The type in the first
American written geography (Morse) was 8 point (pica), while
most of the type in Harper’s School Geography (1876) was 12

Geography, J. A. Cummins, 1813.

206 OLD TEXTBOOKS

point (pica). However, the principal reason for larger books
was that maps became an integral part of all geographies. The
earlier books either contained no maps or at most several folded
maps. Of course, with frequent use the folded maps would soon
tear. The use of folded maps was followed by the practice of
having separate atlases to accompany the regular geography
textbook. This was both inconvenient and expensive. Thus after
1840 the practice of including maps, and later maps in color,
developed rapidly and maps were scaled in miles. After 1850 it
became common to include map questions in the text. So the use
of larger type and particularly the inclusion of maps resulted

1 in the tripling of the size of geography textbooks.

Further to prove that the introduction of maps was the chief
reason for the marked increase in the size as indicated by the
fact that earlier books actually averaged more pages per book
than the later ones: the six geographies published before 1800
averaged 358 pages, and the 24 published from 1800 to 1825,
5254 pages; while those between 1850 and 1875, only 147 pages
per book. The authors needed the large pages for the maps, not
for the print.

TREATMENT or CONTENT

, The topics dealt with in the content of the geography textbooks
did not differ too much on the average from the earliest (1784)
to those of the latter part of the nineteenth century._However,
during any particular period there were considerable differences
among the authors; For example, in dealing with our Mother
Country, England, Morse (178%) covered the following topics:
boundaries and extent; air, soil, and productions; inhabitants
and character; religion; government; and history. Dwight’s Ge-
ography of the World (1795) asked 38 questions in catechetical
fashion (with answers) about England. These dealt with many
detailed matters not covered by Morse. Goldsmith in An Easy
Grammar of Geography (1806) devoted most of the space on
Great Britain to naming its various divisions and parts, naming

the 40 counties of England, the 12 of Wales, the 33 of Scotland,

GEOGRAPHIES 207

and the 32 of Ireland. Such treatment must have been very un-
interesting to the students.
Apparently, it was soon discovered that the type of treatment

‘followed by Morse was more satisfactory than the others‘ just

mentioned, so later authors soon began to model their treatment
more fully on Morse. Parish in 1810 dealt with England under
boundaries, climate, soil and products, rivers and mountains,
bridges and canals, commerce, population and character, army
and navy, literature, cities, political importance, curiosities, gov-
ernment, religion, and islands. Olney in 1830 covered England
under boundaries, surface and soil, climate, minerals, character
of the people, and towns. 8

Similar topics were treated in the following decades of the
century. Cornell in 1859 dealt with geographical position, sur-
face, soil, inhabitants, traveling facilities, manufacturing and
exports, and cities. Harp_er’s in 1876 dealt with a general descrip-
tion, OCCupations, mines, manufacturers, commerce, and govern-
ment. In Mitchell’s 1899- edition the topics were position and
extent, natural features, products, population, chief towns, gov-
ernment, and religion. Thus the nature of the treatment of the
content under the major divisions soon began to follow a general
pattern which continued until the latter part of the nineteenth
century.

QUALITY OF CONTENT

Modern authorities on the teaching of geography hold that
geography should not consist of isolated details of heterogeneous
material, but rather of an articulated body of geographic knowl-
edge and principles. Such matters as temperature, rainfall, and
topography should not be learned as isolated memory facts, but
should be presented to show that man is what he is, at least partly,
because of his surroundings. Relationships of cause and effect
should be shown.

As stated in the aims three types of relationship are used in
modern geography teaching: (1) cultural to cultural, (2) natural
to natural, and (3) cultural to natural. The last one is considered

208 OLD TEXTBOOKS

to be the best. The cultural to cultural expresses the relationship
between man and his cultural environment. The natural to
natural shows the relation of natural facts. The cultural to
natural shows how man and his culture either inﬂuence or are
inﬂuenced by natural environment.

Since Great Britain has been covered in all regular geography 8

textbooks, both Sahli and Culler carefully analyzed how the
authors from 1784 to 1890 dealt with Britain as far as applying
the above mentioned relationships was concerned. To illustrate
how these relationships were applied to actual content, the follow-
ing extracts are given. In discussing the characteristics of the
English people, Mitchell’s Modern Geography (1840) said:
“Benevolence may be considered a striking feature in the national
character; and in no country are there as many associations for
charitable, benevolent, and religious purposes.” The natural to
natural was shown by Cummings (1818) in writing: “The
weather is inconstant, and the frequency of fogs and clouds con-
tributes much to the perpetual verdure of the country.” The
cultural to natural was shown in Adams’ (1818) treatment of
Ireland, as follows: “These fogs are a great obstruction both to
travelling and to agriculture.”

Next let us note how and to what extent the early authors
applied these relationships to the content dealing with Great
Britain. Two—thirds of the facts in the 49 geographies before
1840 were solely cultural, 20.2 per cent were solely natural, 4,7
per cent were cultural to cultural, 1.7 per cent natural to natural,
and 6.8 per cent cultural to natural in relationship. Great varia-
tions of treatment appeared in the different texts. The greatest
percentage of cultural to natural (21.7 per cent) appeared in
Rudiments of Geography by William C. Woodbridge in 1835. On
the other hand, in dealing with Britain none appeared in Joseph
Scott’s Elements of Geography in 1807.

These data show that the early authors dealt with geography
mainly as a cultural subject centered around man and the activi-
ties of man. Elijah Parish (1810) defended his cultural treat-
ment in saying: “While a pebble or a shell in some works com-
mands a more lucid description than the inhabitants of the

GEOGRAPHIES . 209

country, here (in his text) man is the most distinguished object.”

On an average the 97 geographies from 1840 to 1890, in deal-
ing with Britain, devoted 71.8 per cent of the facts solely to the
cultural, 20.1 per cent solely to the natural, 3.4 per cent to the
cultural to cultural, .8 per cent to the natural to natural, and
4.3 per cent to the cultural to natural. Thus these later ge-
ographies devoted even a lower percentage of facts to the cultural
to natural, which is the modern emphasis. It seems evident that
memory work rather than a study of cause and effect relation-
ships continued to be common in the geographies until 1890.

SUITABILITY OF SUBJECT MATTER

The early geographies were written before the ﬁeld of child
psychology had developed. Little was known or recognized con-
cerning the laws of learning or the stages of maturing. Conse-
quently, the vocabulary used as well as many of the ideas pre-
sented violated both the laws of learning as well as principles of
good taste. Sahli analyzed the vocabularies of ten of the most
popularly used books before 1840. He applied the Yoakam3
Technique to three geographies by Morse, two by Goodrich, and
one each by Dwight, Adams, Olney, Smith, and Mitchell. The
lowest vocabulary grade placement of any of these books was that
by Olney (1830) ; namely, grade ten. Five had an eleventh grade
placement, one a twelfth, two a thirteenth, and one a fourteenth.
Thus all of these books should have been used only in the sec-
ondary school or junior college. Although Morse had written in
his Elements of Geography (1796) that it was “adapted to chil-
dren from 8 to 14 years old,” its vocabulary had an eleventh
grade placement. All of these books were commonly used in grades
much lower than their vocabulary difficulty warranted.

Culler found that the books published after 1840 were written
with much easier vocabularies. He, too, applied the Yoakam
Technique to determine the grade placement of the vocabularies

of ﬁfteen geographies from 1840 to 1888. The ﬁve books pub-

lished during the 1840’s and 1850’s which he analyzed all had a

versity of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa.

210 OLD TEXTBOOKS

grade placement of 10 or a little above. After that the vocabu-
laries became much easier, some as low as a sixth grade place-
ment. Some of these, however, were lower grade geographies.
Nevertheless,there was a marked improvement after 1850 in
adapting the vocabularies to the maturation of the children in
the books.

Another important way in which many of the early geographies
were unsuited for the use of young children was the nature of
the content and ideas in their descriptions and stories. Horror
stories were all too common in some books. Peter Parley’s Ge-
ography (1829) contained a thrilling narration of “rocks and
stones crushing the inhabitants of the Notch in the White Moun-
tains.” In 1836 a teacher published the Village School Ge-
ography, which contained an apparent ampliﬁcation of the Peter
Parley story, as follows:

A few years ago, at the foot of one of these mountains, at a place
called the Notch, there lived a family, in which were three beautiful
children. The house was many miles from any other. A storm came on,
and it rained very hard for two days. A large quantity of earth and
rocks, on the top of the mountain, above the house, was loosened. In
the night the family was awakened by a great noise. They sprang
from their beds and ran naked out of doors. They were overtaken
instantly and covered with the earth, and trees, and stones and water,
falling from the mountain.

Goodrich also portrayed a sea serpent “as large as the mast of
a ship, has frequently been seen, along the shores of New
England.”

Olney (1840) in writing about the dangers of desert travel
wrote, “In 1805, a caravan, consisting of 2,000 persons and 1,800
camels, not finding water at the usual resting place, died of thirst,
both men and animals.”

Tuthill in My Little Geography (184.47) thrillingly narrated
the terrible destruction caused by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius.
She followed her narration with a choice bit of poetry.

A little child had gone to sleep
Upon its mother’s breast,
And full of love she looked at it,

GEOGRAPHIES 211

So peacefully at rest.

But soon a fearful sound she heard
She could not ﬂy from death,
For burning lava ﬁlled the street,
And ashes stopped her breath.

For many years within their home
There was no light or air,

But in the ashes buried deep
In silence they were there.

The reading content often was not only morbid, but also fre-
quently beyond the interests and understanding of the children.
Too, sometimes it was ambiguous and inaccurate. For example,
Scott’s text in 1807 wrote that in North America, “The principal
mountains are the Appalachian or Allegheny Mountains.” Cum-
mings in 1825 referred to “The boa, or serpent of the desert, is
found” in the Barbary States of North Africa, which are “often
80 feet long.” Olney’s text in 1840 contained a similar reference.
Olney also described the “Simoon of Nubia” . . . “The wind here
moves the sand like the waves of the sea; and so rapidly that
nothing can escape it. The Simoon, or poisonous blast from the
desert blows here, and if received into the lungs, causes instant
death.” Nevertheless, he next refers to the climate as “dry and
healthy.” Later competing authors took apparent delight in re-
ferring to such fallacious statements as the above.

Another type of unsuitability was the confused manner in which
certain authors explained things or processes. For example, Smith
(1850) explained the cause of an earthquake as follows:

Earthquakes are sometimes supposed to be caused by electrical
matter,* or inﬂammable air, pent up in the bowels of the earth, sud-
denly ﬁnding vent, and forcing its way through every obstacle.**

*Electrical matter, a thin ﬂuid, of the nature of lightning.

**Just before the shock is felt, the sea often swells and roars
tremendously; the water grows dark and muddy; birds and beasts
are in consternation, and a rumbling noise, like distant thunder, is
heard underground.

After 1850 fewer and fewer ambiguous, inaccurate, and con-
fused statements appear in geography textbooks. Not only was

212 OLD TEXTBOOKS

the vocabulary better adapted to the maturity of the children,
but the acquisition of more accurate knowledge of the geography
of the world made the improvement of the content possible. Too, a
greater understanding of the sensitive nature of children’s minds
led to the elimination of horror stories. The authors, whose books
were in most common use after 1850, such as Colton, Guyot,
Mitchell, and Swinton, did not commit many errors or resort to
violations of good taste.

ATTITUDES REVEALED IN SUBJECT MATTER

Since geography textbooks dealt extensively with people and
customs, the opportunity was great for authors to reveal their
attitudes regarding the various peoples and their ways of living.
In many geographies, especially in the earlier ones, the content
revealed that the attitudes of the authors were often biased.

Religious Attitudes. The earliest geographies were written when
our country was still dominantly Protestant and the academic
leaders were either trained as ministers or at least deeply religious.
J edidiah Morse and Elijah Parish were both Congregational
ministers. Not even all Protestant groups were equally respected.
For example, in the first American written geography, Morse in
1784 referred to the Presbyterians and Lutherans as “numerous
and respectable.” Parish, in enumerating the religious groups,
began with small letters the words Baptists, Methodists, Quakers,
and Catholics, but began with capital letters Presbyterian, Con-
gregationalists, and Lutherans. ‘

Many of the early books particularly contained unfavorable
comments about other religions than Protestants. Morse in his
1790 edition referred to Roman Catholicism in Spain as “of
most bigoted, superstitious, and tyrannical character.” Dwight
(1806), Parish (1810), and Adams (1818) used the term “Pop-
ery” in referring to Roman Catholicism. Davies (1805) claimed
that the priests in Ireland ruled with “blind superstition and
ignorance.” Many other early geographies contained similar
statements.

Later several geography textbooks were written by Catholic

GEOGRAPHIES Q13

authors which were equally biased against Protestantism. Among
these were texts by Pinnock (1853) and Sadlier (1880). The

latter, in referring to religious conditions in Ireland, said:

England abandoned the Catholic faith in the 16th century, and to
this country belongs the ignoble distinction of having oppressed and
persecuted the Irish nation with a barbarity unparalleled in the
history of man’s inhumanity to man.

Most Protestant authors referred to the Protestants in Euro-
pean countries with respect. Parish (1810) said, “The Scotch
clergy are men of learning and piety.” Woodbridge (1835) said,
in referring to the Scots, “They are remarkable for knowledge
and morality, produced by their numerous schools, and their at-
tention to public worship.”

In referring to non-Christian religions, likewise, uncompli-
mentary statements were often made. A number of authors re-
ferred to Mahomet as an “imposter.” Morse (1800) wrote: “In
a word, the contagion spread over Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and
Persia; Mahomet, from a deceitful hypocrite, became the most
powerful monarch in his time.” Warren in 1872 referred to
Mohammed as a “false prophet.” Uncomplimentary statements
were also made about the religions in Japan and India.

Reform Attitudes. The teaching of religion and morality was
really the chief aim of education in early American schools. This
aim was even dominant. in geography textbooks. Thus many forms
of behavior which the authors considered immoral were severely
condemned.

Alcohol. Morse (1790) believed “in proportion as the use of
beer increases, in the same proportion will the use of spiritous
liquors decrease. This will be a happy exchange.” Parish (1810)
condemned the “numerous Taverns,” and “grogshops.” Several
condemned the sale of liquors to Indians.

Tobacco. The use of tobacco was frowned on by Morse and
Parish. Morse referred to a law enacted by Connecticut govern-
ing the use of tobacco. Parish said, “The culture of this weed

214 OLD TEXTBOOKS

produces wretchedness, and affords no sustenance to the labourers.”

Sports and games. The moral teaching of these early books
even related to sports and games. Morse (1790) in speaking of
his own New Englanders, said:

The gamester, the horse—_jockey, and the knave, are equally de-
spised, and their company is avoided by all who would sustain fair
and irr-eproachable characters. The odious and inhuman practices of
duelling, gouging, cock—ﬁghting and horseracing, are scarcely known
here.

In reference to moral habits in North Carolina, he wrote, “The
time they waste in drinking, idling, and gambling, leaves them
very little opportunity to improve their plantations or their
minds.” Davies (1805) added the vices of horseracing and cock-
fighting to the list of bad habits of the North Carolinians. Most
of the later geographies failed to comment on games and sports.

Slavery. A number of the earlier authors viewed slavery as
one of the greatest of evils. Morse commented critically regarding
it in several of his geographies. Davies (1805) said, “Here as
well as in every other country where it has prevailed largely,
slavery has produced its peculiar train of vices, pride, indolence,
and cruelty.” Dwight (1796), apparently in praise of New
England Wrote:

Q. Are there any slaves?
A. NONE.

Adams (1818) declared, “Slavery, that bane of morals, and re-
proach of free governments, is hardly known in New England.”

By the 1830’s the denunciations against slavery softened. For
example, Goodrich explained what kind of persons were made
slaves, in saying, “The slaves procured by these ships are gen-
erally obtained of the petty sovereigns along the coast, who sell
criminals and captives taken in war.” Huntington (1835) wrote,
“Many of the slaves are treated by their owners with a good de-
gree of kindness and humanity, and often contented and cheerful,
though in a state of lamentable ignorance.” No doubt, the desire

GEOGRAPHIES 215
by the authors to sell their books also in the South did much to

A change their treatment of slavery.

Attitudes Toward Sectionalésm. Due partly to the lack of toler-
ance of the times and partly to the fact that most of the earliest
authors were New Englanders, or at least Northerners, it could
be expected that considerable bias of sectionalism entered the
early geographies. Morse (1790) defended the New Englanders
against the accusation that they were “knavish, artful, and dis-
honest,” in saying of them, “there is as great a proportion ‘of
honest and industrious citizens, as in any of the United States.”
Olney 1830) said of the New Englanders, “The people of these
states are intelligent, moral, industrious, and enterprising. They
rank first in each of the learned professions, wit_h the best me-
chanics, best farmers, and best seamen in the country.”

In the main, a favorable attitude was expressed toward the
Middle Atlantic States, particularly the Dutch in New York.
Morse (1800) wrote:

Hence it is that the neatness, parsimony and industry of the Dutch
were early imitated by the ﬁrst English settlers in the province, and
until the revolution, formed a distinguishing trait in their provincial
character.

This favorable attitude toward the Dutch may have been due
partly to the fact that they were fellow Calvinists with the Cal-
vinistic authors of New England. However, several books were
critical of the Pennsylvania Germans. Morse (1790) , who quoted
Kalm, said, “They are very well known for their avarice and
selfishness,” and are guilty “of working themselves to death.” »He
also said that they were superstitious, but acknowledged that
even though “they possess less refinement than their Southern
neighbors, who cultivate their lands with slaves, they possess
more republican virtue.” Both Morse and Davies praise the Penn-
sylvanians for opposing slavery.

It was the South that was most critically treated. Parish
(1810), who was a New England minister, compared the sections

of the U.S., as follows:

We now proceed to examine another section of the country. A new

216 OLD TEXTBOOKS

shade of character commences. We shall no longer describe a hardy
race of industrious farmers, living together on terms of equality.
Instead of the social villages of New England, and the Middle States,
their highly cultivated farms, and numerous ﬂocks, and herds, we shall
discover thinly scattered farm houses, some of them miserable hovels,
and a few miles distant, a lofty mansion, surrounded by 100 negro
huts; some of these wretched inhabitants are in rags, and some naked;
some of them black, and partly white; an index of their morals.

Morse described the Virginians as “indolent, easy and good
natured; extremely fond of society, and much given to convivial
pleasures.” The young men were referred to as “gamblers, cock-
ﬁghters, and horse—jockies.” Davies (1805), Dwight (1806), and
Smith (1816) criticized the severe social stratification and lack
of democracy in the South. By the 1830’s these unfavorable
characterizations of the South greatly softened. Their compari-
sons became more objective and analytical. After the 1830’s the
treatment of the South became even more unbiased.

Racial and nationality attitudes. The earlier authors, whenever
they dealt with the different races at all, usually considered the
Caucasian race superior ‘to the others. A typical treatment in a
very popular textbook was that by Mitchell (1840), as follows:

The European or Caucasian is the most noble of the ﬁve races of
men. It excels all others in learning and the arts, and includes the
most powerful nations of ancient and modern times. The most valu-
able institutions of society, and the most important and useful in-
ventions, have originated with the people of this race.

The Negro race was referred to as “ignorant and degraded.”
Morgan described them as exhibiting “a degradation which usu-
ally attends an enslaved condition.” The Mongolians were some-
times rated as civilized and possessing much intellectual power,
but little enterprise.

The characterizations of peoples by nationality were much
more extensive and complete than by race. So the treatment here
will necessarily be a mere sampling by authors and peoples. It
will be noted that most of the characterizations on the surface
appear to be very biased. The question to be raised here, however,
may be whether the authors themselves really were so biased or

GEOGRAPHIES 217

whether the limited sources from which they derived their in-
formation were the real cause.

American I ndian. The American Indian was sometimes charac-
terized as savage, barbarous, warlike, and rude; yet he was also
defended by several authors. Morse (1790) criticized the Euro-
peans “who ﬁrst visited these shores, treating the natives as wild
beasts of the forest, which have no property in the woods where
they roam.” Adams (1818) and Smith (1839) both mentioned
the bad as well as the good characteristics of the Indians. Hunt-
ington respected their ﬁghting qualities.

Latz'nAmericans. The attitudes expressed by a number of the
early authors would hardly have developed a “Good Neighbor
Policy” toward Latin America. Morse (1790) said:

The Creoles (Mexicans) have all the bad qualities of the Spaniards,
from whom they are descended, without the courage, ﬁrmness and
patience, which make the praiseworthy part of the Spanish charac-
ter. . . . From idleness and constitution, their whole business is
amour and intrigue; Their ladies of consequence are not distinguished
for their chastity or domestic virtues.

A number of later authors continued to be equally critical of
the Mexicans. Huntington (1835) referred even to their whites
as “ignorant, superstitious, indolent and proﬂigate.” Goodrich
(1839) said, “The whites are vicious, and lead indolent and luxu-
rious lives.”

The South Americans received similar treatment. Smith (1816)
said, “A white person (in Paraguay) will rather starve than
work. . . . They will beg, rob, or murder, rather than work.”
Huntington (1835), in describing the Brazilians, said, “The love
of gold and diamonds, and the love of sloth, are paramount to
the love of liberty, learning, industry and virtue.”

Several authors, however, said only good things about the
people of Chile. The Aricanians of Northern Chile were praised
“for their love of liberty, bravery, and humanity,” by Olney in
1830. Griffen (1839) said, “Chile is inhabited by a population
that appears to be superior in industry, enterprise, and skill, to
the other inhabitants of South America.”

Europeans. In dealing with the Europeans it must be kept in
mind there are involved many nationalities and that there were
many authors who wrote about them, so only a sampling of com-
ments can be presented here. Since the earlier geographies’ were
written soon after the Revolution, a number of writers were
critical of England. Morse (1796) said, “Her wealth and power
have made her proud and haughty; and, in consequence, her fall,
by many, is predicted to be not far distant.” However, a change
of attitude took place, due partly to the increased trade with
her and, no doubt, partly to the fact that most authors had an
English ancestry. Dwight (180-6) referred to the English as
being of “good stature, shape, and complexion; the women are
handsome and graceful in their appearance, beyond that of al-
most any country.” Adams (1818) said, “The English appear
to possess a mien between the gravity of the German, and the
liveliness of the French,” and Griffen (1839) referred to them
as “intelligent, brave and industrious.” I

The Scots received favorable treatment from most authors. A
number of characterizations were similar to the one by Cummings
(1818), who described them as, “temperate, industrious, hardy,
and valiant.” More attention was given the Irish by a number of
authors, and generally the treatment was sympathetic, due, no
doubt inypart, to what was considered by many Americans, to
unfairtreatment of Ireland by England. Goodrich (1839) men-
tioned how the British trade restrictions affected Dublin, and
accordingly said, “The crowds of ragged and miserable wretches,
who appear in every part of the city, however, tell a melancholy
story of poverty and distress which exist within and around it.”
Cummings (1818) characterized the Irish as, “generally well
made, strong, active, haughty, careless of their lives, and greedy
of glory; quick of apprehension, courteous of strangers, and
often violent in their passions.”

The characterizations of the (German people were mixed, but
more favorable than unfavorable. Davies (1805) wrote, “The
Saxons are a lively and contented people; the Prussians dull and
gloomy.” Dwight (1806) said that they were “fond of show and
parade in their dress.” Woodbridge (1835) wrote, “The people

GEOGRAPHIES 219

are generally well instructed, industrious, and moral, except in
some eastern provinces.” Griffen (1839) prophetically said, “The
Prussians are chieﬂy distinguished as a military nation.”

The Austrians were described much like the Germans. A
teacher (1836) said, “They resemble the Germans. They are
patient, good natured, love to smoke, and make ﬁne music.” The
Hungarians, the other people of the dual monarchy, received little
praise. Mention by a number of authors referred to them as a
strong and robust people, who, however, were rude, revengeful,
and warlike.

The Swiss, most of them being Germanic in type, strongly
Protestant and republican in spirit, received more universal
praise than any European people. For example, Woodbridge
(1835) said, “The Swiss are generally well educated, and are re-
markable for their bravery, industry, and virtue.”

Worcester (1822) described the Dutch as “industrious and
honest but not beautiful.” Goodrich (1839) said of them, “Smok-
ing tobacco is practiced by both sexes at all hours; and as the
Dutch are said to be ever ruminating on ways and means to get
money, they are represented as very unsociable.”

The Scandinavians, composed of the Swedes, Norwegians, and
Danes, received mixed treatment, at first rather unfavorable and
later mostly favorable. O’Neill (1816) said of the Danes, “Many
of the peasantry continue in a state of vassalage; they are con-
sequently idle, dirty, and dispirited.” The Norwegians were de-
scribed as honest, brave, and industrious. The Swedes received
the most favorable treatment. Smith (1816) described them as
“peaceable, seldom guilty of atrocious crimes, correct in their
judgment, fond of convivial entertainments.”

The Russian nation, in general, received the same treatment
by the earlier authors as it is receiving today in the American
press. Russia was condemned for defeating and taking territory
from Sweden and partitioning Poland. Morse (1796) referred
to the Russian government as “despotic, and the great body of
the people are in a state of barbarism.” Parish (1810) said, “The
Russian husbands are unkind and cruel to a proverb,” and Adams
(1818) referred to the rule of the Czar as absolute.

The treatment of the peoples in the Romance nations was

220 OLD TEXTBOOKS

mostly unfavorable. Of these, the French, no doubt partly due
to their help during the American Revolution, received the best
treatment, but not fully favorable. Certain extreme acts com-
mitted by them were condemned. Adams (1818) wrote, “Louis
XVI was dethroned, and, contrary to every principle of humanity
and injustice, in January, 1793, was beheaded,” and Dwight
(1806) referred to Napoleon as a “usurper.” Most authors were
more complimentary regarding the character of the French
people than of their political actions. O’Neill (1816) wrote, “The
French are polite, vivacious, and brave; but their levity has often
led them into excesses which have proved ruinous to their national
prosperity.” Several other authors characterized them similarly.

The treatment given the Italians was mostly unfavorable in
nature. Morse (1790) said, “They are amorous and addicted to
criminal indulgences, revengeful, and masters of the art of dis-
simulation.” Parish (1810) referred to the Sardinians as seizing
“every opportunity to rob and murder.” Olney, in 1830, offered
a mixed characterization, in saying, “The Italians are affable
and polite; and excel in music, painting, and sculpture; but they
are effeminate, superstitious, slavish, and revengeful.”

The treatment of Spaniards was mixed, but not very favorable.
Morse (1796) said, “Spain might be one of the richest countries
in Europe were it not that the inhabitants are indolent and un-
enterprising.” In a later edition Morse (1800) said, “no deceit,
no cruelty Was too great to be made use of, to satisfy their
avarice.” On the other hand O’Neill (1816), even though admit-
ting their cruelty at times, said “their treatment of prisoners of
war has often been humane and generous.” Other authors de-
scribed them as brave and generous at times, but also haughty
and bigoted.

Asiatics. Most of the Asiatics were given a more or less un-
favorable characterization by a number of the early authors.
Dwight (1806), who copied his description of the Turks from
an English geography by William Guthrie (1792), said they
were “indolent and superstitious, but commonly temperate. They
are heavy, morose, treacherous, furiously passionate, unsocial,
and unfriendly to people of other nations.” Goodrich’s treatment

GEOGRAPHIES 221

of them as late as 1839 was little better. Dwight was critical of
the Arabs, in saying, “The word Arab signiﬁes robber; and they
answer perfectly to the name.” However, Smith (1839) acknowl-
edged, due to their belief in the Koran, that they were free from
drunkenness and gaming.

The treatment of the Persians was mixed. Several early ge-
ographies contained tolerant treatment, but several later authors
were quite critical. Woodbridge (1835) referred to them as “in-
dolent, timid, and superstitious.” Contrary to what one would
find in a modern geography, the people of India received little
attention in the early geographies. Different authors charac-
terized the Chinese as being vain, artful, timid, jealous, and vin-
dictive. However, Woodbridge (1835) was considerate enough
to say that they were “ingenious and industrious.”

On the whole, Sahli, who analyzed the American geographies
before 184:0, found that many of the authors expressed critical
attitudes and characterizations of the peoples of many countries
of the world. No doubt, such treatment was due to a number of
reasons, among them nationalistic, racial, and religious biases
held by the writers of these books. On the other hand, Culler, who
analyzed the geographies from 1840 to 1890, found few such
unfavorable attitudes expressed. No doubt, greater tolerance and
objectivity on the part of the authors made for more favorable
treatment.

TEACHING AND LEARNING AIDS

The first state teacher training and normal school established
in the United States was at Lexington, Massachusetts, in 1839.
Since forty—one of the geographies analyzed by Sahli were pub-
lished before that date, it was not unexpected to have many of
the authors present plans and suggestions as to how their texts
should be taught. Cummings’ (1818) book contained fourteen
and one—half pages devoted to teaching methods. Woodbridge
(1836) addressed a page to “Inexperienced Teachers,” in which
he enumerated ten speciﬁc steps for teaching geography.

222 OLD TEXTBOOKS

Teaching methods. An analysis of geography textbooks reveals a
variety of teaching methods, either deﬁnitely suggested by the
authors or implied from the organization or presentation of the
sub ect matter. The variety is due, no doubt, to the kind of method
favored by the different authors personally, in part to the chang-
ing views on method with the passing of time, and to the ac-
ceptance of certain educational theories, for example, Pestaloz—
zianism. The methods most commonly suggested or implied were
the following:

Catechetical. Due to the strong inﬂuence of religion when the
earlier books were written, many authors modeled their books on
the catechetical part of the N ew England Primer. Among the
early books which were written by the “question and answer”
method, in whole or part, were those by Dwight, John Smith,
Olney, Mitchell, Roswell Smith, and Goodrich. This was partic-
ularly true of primary geographies, after books were published
in series, After 1840 this method decreased. Culler found that
only 10 of the 97 geographies after 1840 used this method, and
only one after 1860.

Correlation. Correlating the study of geography with the subject
of reading, spelling, history, and numbers, was suggested by a
number of early authors. Cummings (1818) said, “Whenever
words occur in (geography) reading, whose signiﬁcation is not
perfectly well known, they should be marked with a lead pencil,
or a pen, carefully looked up in a dictionary, and prepared to
be given at recitation.” The same author also said, “The history
of any country without a knowledge of its geography, loses its
reality, and to youth appears almost visionary.” Mitchell, whose
books were very popular, held similar views. Emma Willard cor-
related it with numbers, in suggesting:

For example, the number 4: placed near a river, indicates that the
river is 4 times the length of the Connecticut River. The length
being reckoned at 400 miles, we have at once the real as well as the
comparative length of the river.

After 1840 correlation was suggested by fewer authors.

GEOGRAPHIES 223

Dedactive method. The plan of beginning with general principles
and then applying them to speciﬁcs was used only by a few of the
early authors. However, it was used in many geographies after
1840, continuing until 1890. The plan was to study the continent
as a whole first, then the countries, and next such details, as 8

their boundaries, their extent, their rivers, lakes and mountains,
their islands, civil divisions, and chief towns; and, to assist his
memory, a uniform arrangement of these subj ects has been carefully
preserved: a short enumeration of natural productions, and of manu-
factures closes the geographical description of each country.
(Bazeley, 1830).

Inductive method. This method reverses the procedure; namely, 8

it goes from the particular to the general, from the known to the
unknown. This was the plan strongly advocated by that great
Swiss educator, Johann Pestalozzi (1746-1827). He referred to
it as the “Home Geography” approach. His ideas began to be
accepted by certain American geography writers during the
1820’s. Woodbridge was the first to do so in 1822. Emma Willard
(1826) said, “Instead of commencing the study of maps with the
map of the world, which is the most difficult to understand, the
pupil here begins, in the most simple manner imaginable, to draw
the map of his own town.” Olney (1830) said, “The learner must
make himself master of simple things, before he can understand
those which are complex.” Other authors to use this approach,
whose books were widely used, were Goodrich, Guyot, Fitch, and
Hall.

Laboratory method. A later developed method used by several
authors was to provide real experiences by having the pupils
secure geographic information by direct observation or by doing
things in relation to geography in the school. Guyot (1866) was
the first to follow this approach. In the Preface there is stated,
“The best possible plan will be to take them occasionally into the
ﬁelds for a lesson.” In Appleton’s Elementary Geography (1880)
there was suggested the making of relief maps with modeling sand.
This teaching approach was a distinct departure from the most
common earlier methods.

Use of visual aids and maps. In a subject like geography, where
the need for eye training is great, it is important to determine to
what extent visual aids are provided in the textbooks. Such aids
may take the form of pictures, maps, drawings, graphs, and so
on. An analysis of 146 geographies up to 1890 reveals that not
nearly all contained visual aids. Only 25 of the 49 texts before
1840 contained maps, while every one but one contained them
after 1860. Picture illustrations were in even fewer early books,
in only 17 of the early 49 texts. Eighty—one of the 97 after 1840
contained illustrations. Graphs or diagrams were used in the same
number of books as maps; namely 105 of the 1496.

Questions. More books included questions than any other learn-
ing aid; namely, 126. In many of the earlier books these took the
form of a catechism. However, later they were placed in the books
in different ways, and related to different matters. Sahli found that
47.8 per cent were map questions, and 51.8 per cent related to
reading matter, and a few to statistical data. Culler’s study of
the later geographies reveals that 74.9 per cent were map ques~
tions, 22 per cent related to reading content, and 2.9 per cent
were about statistical matters. Sahli found that the words with
which most questions began in order of frequency were: “What,”
“How,” “Where,” “Which,” and “Describe.” Culler found that
the later books did not contain nearly so many questions, and the
beginning words most commonly used in order of frequency were:
“How,” “Describe,” “For,” and “By.” It should be noted that
the nature of the questions must have changed radically.

Prefaces and introductions. Next to questions, prefaces appeared
more frequently than any other aid; namely, in 125 of the 146
books. Prefatory content commonly dealt with reasons for Writing
the book, improvements in their books, criticism of other books,
recognition of sources and materials, and, especially in the earlier
books, suggestions for the more effective teaching or learning of
the book. Fifty-nine books contained introductions. Nearly all
books included either a preface or an introduction, and 447 had
both. The introductions, too, were used for various purposes. One
purpose was to motivate the study of geography by arousing an

GEOGRAPHIES 225

interest in it and acquaint the reader with the ﬁeld and the pur-
pose of the book. A few presented deﬁnitions in the introduction.
In general, its purpose was to aid the teacher or the pupil or both
in mastering the study of geography.

MOST POPULAR GEOGRAPHIES

Geography was given little attention in our colonial ‘schools.
Noah Webster, in a letter to Henry Barnard,wrote:

When I was young, the books used were chieﬂy or wholly Dilworth’s
Spelling books, the Psalter, Testament and Bible. No- geography was
studied before the publication of Dr. Morse’s small books on the
subject.

Thus the treatment of geographies will begin with Morse. How-
ever, since the writer’s collection contains approximately 350
geographies and atlases written by 113 different authors, it would
be unwise to attempt to discuss all of them. Only those authors
whose textbooks appeared in many editions will be discussed.

Reverend J edidiah Morse (1761-1826) . The first American author
of a geography, as was true of many other early textbooks was a
minister. The ministers were commonly the most highly educated
persons in early American history. Geography Made Easy by
Morse was published in New Haven in 1784. Apparently this
text became rather popular, for it appeared in numerous editions.
It was addressed:

To the Young Gentlemen and Ladies, throughout the United States.
This Compendious System of Geography, (a Science, no longer
esteemed as a polite and agreeable accomplishment only, but as a
necessary and important Part of Education)-——is, with the most
Ardent wishes

The Author

Morse was graduated from Yale in 1783 and the following year

published his geography. For more than thirty years he was the
pastor of the First Church (Congregational), Charlestown,
Massachusetts. Apparently his calling was the ministry, but his
real interest was the writing of books in the ﬁelds of geography
and history. '  

His Geography Made Easy had 214 pages 31/2. by 6 inches in
size, and included several folded uncolored maps. The small pages
contained an average of 38 lines and ten words per line. The
print was very small, 7 point type. The content was presented
very factually, without the aid of pictures. However, the content
was presented in an organized and systematized way. For ex-
ample, the geography of the United. States was divided by states,
and then the facts about each state was treated under such head-
ings as divisions, counties, towns, rivers, climate, soil, produce,
inhabitants and their character, government, religion, history,
and curiosities. However, it contained no speciﬁc table of contents,
index, glossary, pictures, or questions. Under “curiosities” in
Pennsylvania it described a mound of earth 100 miles below
Pittsburgh 216 feet in height and 631 feet in circumference. This
was inaccurate, for this mound was what is now Moundsville, West
Virginia, but then was in Virginia.

Morse published The American Universal Geography in 1789;
Elements of Geography in 1795; and A New System of Modern
Geography in 1822, which was written jointly with his son
Sidney Morse. These were larger than his first book.

Incidentally, J edidiah Morse had three famous sons. Samuel
F. B. Morse was a famous artist and the inventor of the first
telegraph; Sidney E. Morse was a journalist, geographer, and
inventor; and R. C. Morse, with Sidney, founded the New York
Observer in 1823.

Nathaniel Dwight. In 1795 Dwight wrote A Short but Compre-
hensive System of the Geography of the World. This was a book
of 216 pages in ﬁne print. The last one-third of it dealt with the
Americas. Throughout it was like a catechism consisting of ques-
tions and answers. It appeared in at least four editions. Under
the “natural curiosities” of Pennsylvania it referred to “Oil
Creek, on whose water floats an oil similar to the Barbados tar.”

Minor Geographies: 1800-1820. During these twenty years
geography textbooks were written by Benjamin Davies (1804:),
Joseph Scott (1807), John Hubbard (1807), Elijah Parish
(1810), J. A. Cummins (1813), Benjamin Gleason (1814:),
Jacob Willetts (1814:), John O’Neil (1816), John Smith(1816),
Daniel Adams (1818), and J. E. Worcester (1819). Of these
the textbooks by Parish, Cummins, Willetts, Adams, and Worces-
ter appeared in more than one edition.

Jesse Ol/ney (1798-1872). His educational career was largely
spent in New York and Connecticut. He became a prolific text-
book Writer, writing readers, arithmetics, and histories, as well
as geographies. His Practical System of Modern Geography ﬁrst
was published in 1828. The 1851 printing of this book was the
siXty—third edition. Olney’s was the first popular geography to
follow the Morse books.

This book of nearly 300 pages was much more attractively pre-
pared than most of its predecessors, containing many interesting
pictures and many instructive tables. Its questions were arranged
to check on the mastery of the content. The later editions were
revisions of the first. 1

Peter Parley (S. G. Goodrich) (1793-1860). Goodrich Wrote text-
books in reading, history,
spelling, science, and geog-
raphy. Of these his histories
and geographies gained wid-
est circulation. In 1831 he

published the C'hild’s Book of

American Geography and A
System of School Geography.
Then in 184:0 there appeared
A Pictorial Geography of the
World, and in 184.4 Peter
Parley’s "Geography for Be-

A pleasant illustrated children’s
geography, 1831.

GEOGRAPHIES 229

giuuers. All of these appeared in many editions. For example, the
1839 printing of his System was the twenty-seventh edition.

All of Peter Parley’s textbooks were characterized by their
attractiveness and the inclusion of numerous pictures. For ex-
ample, the Child’s Book contained 60 pictures and 18 maps. Up
to that time no geographies were so well graded and illustrated.
No wonder that they appealed to children.

Roswell Smith. In 1835 he published his Geography on the Pro-
ductive System. This book, like Dwight’s, was meant to be taught
inductively. The first 100 pages are largely devoted to questions
and answers. Then larger sections of content are presented factu-
ally and followed by questions at the end of sections. The book

2 contains some pictures, but no maps. Separately he published an

Atlas. Both books appeared in many editions. The 1857 book was
the forty—ﬁrst edition. He also published, in 1846, An Intro-
ductory Geography.

Minor Geographies, 1820-1840. Many geographies appeared
during those twenty years. Books by the following authors ap-
peared in more than one edition: Sidney Morse (1822), William
Woodbridge (1823), J. L. Blake (1826), S. R. Hall (1828),
Nathaniel Huntington (1833), Samuel Butler (1834), and
probably others.

Augustus Mitchell. The geographies written by Mitchell ap-
parently had the widest circulation of any appearing in the United
States before 1900. The writ.er’s collection contains 47 different
copies under seven different titles. The first was A System. of
M oderrn Geography in 1839, and the lastest bears the date, 1895.
Thus the period of their circulation covered more than 50 years.
Of these seven different books the System apparently was the
most popular, for the collection contains fifteen of them.

In make—up and size it was similar to Smith’s Productive
System. The first 50 pages were like a catechism of questions and
answers. Then there were 25 pages of map questions in fine print.
These were questions about the maps in the Atlas. The remainder

230 OLD TEXTBOOKS

of the book was descriptive geography about the different coun-
tries of the world, with questions at the end of each section. It
contained more than 800 pages 4 by 61/2 inches, and included
many small pictures. 8
Next most popular were Mitchell’s lower books; namely, his
Primary, New—Primary, and First Lessons in Geography. His
Intermediate, Ancient, and School geographies were less widely
used. However, all of these went through several editions. His
later books were larger in dimensions and contained colored maps.
Mitchell apparently attempted to understand what kinds of ge-
ographies the schools wanted and then prepared them accordingly.

iArnold Gnyot (1807-1884). Gruyot was born and reared in

Switzerland, where he was inﬂuenced by Karl Ritter’s views about
geography. After teaching physical geography there for ten
years he came to America, where for six years he was employed
by the Massachusetts State Board of Education as a lecturer on
geography in their normal schools. It is claimed that he brought
to America the rudiments of geography as a science.

In 1849 he published The Earth and Man. This book im-
mediately gained wide acceptance. In it he attempted to relate
the cultural elements of geography to the natural, which is the
approach now followed in most modern geographies. Thus he
was a forerunner in developing a new and meaningful approach
in teaching geography. However, it contained no maps. It implied
the use of an atlas. It was a rather advanced book.

Later Gruyot wrote other texts to provide a graded series of
geographies. In 1866 he published a Primary, and a Common
School Geography. Still later he prepared an Elementary, an
Intermediate, and a Grammar School Geography. His geogra-
phies continued to appear until the 1880’s. His later books became
very large, containing many pictures and maps to assist the
pupils to relate the cultural elements to the natural.

S. S. Cornell. In 1854 she published her Primary, in 1855 an
Intermediate, and in 1856 the High School Geography. These,
she claimed, formed a “systematic series of school geographies.”
In the Preface of the Primary Geography she criticized other

GEOGRAPHIES 231

geographies for employing unexplained terms, “burying up of
what, at present, only was attainable, by that which should be the
very last learned,” and “rendering maps, professedly intended
to elucidate,” as “Labyrinths of Perplexity.” This book was very
attractive, with many‘ pictures, and a few simple colored maps. It
was written on the inductive plan.

Most series of three did not specify the third part to be a High
School book. It was different from the two lower books. Its out-
side dimensions were smaller and the number of pages greater. It
contained 405 pages; the lower ones had fewer than 100 each. It
contained many pictures but no maps. Questions appeared at the
end of each section. All three went into many editions. Later
Cornell wrote other geographies, but they failed to become
popular. -

James M onteith. In 1854 he published his First Lessons in
Geography. This was a simple and attractive little book. It went
through several revisions and editions until well after. 1900. The
later editions were planned on the “Ob ect Teaching” approach,
emphasizing an appeal to the eyes in addition to what may be
derived from the reading material.

In 1856 the Manual of Geography appeared. This was a book
of 112 pages, 71/2 by 9 inches. It contained many pictures and
maps. Throughout it was more or less in catechetical form. Later
this book was enlarged, and in 1857 an Introduction to the
Manual was published. Thus the series consisted of three books.
These books also appeared in many editions.

Other Geographies. A number of other authors wrote geographies
between 1850 and 1900 which gained considerable circulation.
Francis McNa1ly published An Improved System of Geography
in 1855, which continued in different editions until the late 1870’s.

In 1870 M. F. Maury published his Manual of Geography. He
also wrote an Elementary and a Physical Geography. All of these
want into several printings.

In 1875 Harper’s School Geographywas published. This was
a large and attractive book with many pictures and colored maps.
It was descriptive, with questions at the end of sections. Two years

 OLD TEXTBOOKS

later Harper’s published an Introductory Geography to precede
the other. This was similar in nature and approach, but smaller.
Both continued to have considerable circulation even through the
1880p.

Also in 1875 William Swinton published an Elementary Course
in Geography. This was followed by the Grammar—School Ge-
ography in 1880. Apparently he soon realized that the Ele-
mentary was not well received, so he replaced it with the Intro-
ductory Geography. These geographies never became as popular
as the textbooks by Swinton in other ﬁelds, such as reading and
composition.

In 1880 the Appleton Series of geographies began to appear.
The Elementary and the Higher Geographies appeared ﬁrst.
Then later the Lessons in Geography for Little Learners was
published. The authorship of these, as well as of the Harper texts,
was not identified. Each series was named after the publisher.
Neither series became popular.

Beginning in 1887 geographies by Jacques Redway and R.
Hinman appeared. These appeared under ﬁve different titles,
several of which continued to appear even after 1900.

Many other geographies
were written during the last
half of the nineteenth century,
but received few adoptions.

CONCLUDING COMMENTS

The textbooks in no other
field changed so in size from
the earliest to the latest as
geographies. For example, the
pages of the 1796 of the Ele-
ments of Geography by Morse
were 31/8 by 5 inches, while in

Monteith, First Lessons in Geog-
raphy, 1854«-——note question and
answer format.

GEOGRAPHIES 233

a late edition of Guyot’s Grammar School Geography they were
10 by 121/2 inches. Thus the latter was eight times the size of the
former.

Another feature was that the catechetical approach was more
common and continued longer than in the textbooks -of any other
ﬁeld. Naturally the type of questions varied from author to
author. Those questions which were rather factual evidently led
to much memory learning. On the other hand, thoughtful ques~
tions of an inductive nature must have resulted in a meaningful
understanding of geography.

Today We always expect a geography textbook to contain maps.
Yet this was far from universally true in the past. Twenty—four
of the 49 texts before 1840 analyzed by Sahli contained no maps.
Even ten of the 97 analyzed by Culler between 1840 and 1890
had no maps. In most cases, however, the authors of these geogra-
phies had atlases to accompany their texts.

AMERICAN HISTORIES

A LA TE ARRIVAL

MERICAN history as a school subject seems to have been a
laggard in entering the American school curriculum. Several
reasons may be given. When such subjects as religion, reading,
spelling, and geography were being introduced in the schools
during the colonial period, there was no unity among the colonies,
and hence no common American government. The interest of most
early settlers was mostly only in their own colony. A common
interest did not develop until the Revolution and later. Too, not
a sufficient number of significant historical events were known or
recognized in the area that now constitutes the United States to
provide a common body of knowledge to compose such a school
sub ect as American history.

While only eight or nine American history textbooks were
published in our country before 1820, and apparently none had a
wide circulation, this does not necessarily mean that children in
our schools learned no American history. In fact they must have
been exposed to considerable historical content, but mostly through
their study of other kinds of textbooks. The two subjects through
which historical content was most often presented were reading
and geography. A number of the early readers contained many
historical reading selections. This was particularly true of Noah

Q34

AMERICAN HISTORIES 235

Webster’s An American Selection of Lessons in .Reading and
Speaking. This was the Third Part of Webster’s Grammatical
Institute of the English Language. It went through a number
of editions, each of which contained considerable historical’ con-
tent. About one-half of the third edition (1787) was historical,
which content later became a part of McCulloch’s textbook on
history. Caleb Bingham’s Colnmbian Orator (1806), which be-
came even more popular than Webster’s reader, contained many
selections which were political and historical in character.

The other ﬁeld in which the early textbooks presented much

historical material was geography. In fact most of the early ge-
ographies were a combination of geography, history, and What
is now known as civics. This continued to be true from Morse’s
first book in 17 84: until the 1820’s, when separate textbooks of
history became more or less common. Thereafter the content in
the geographies became generally only geography.

THE FIRST AMERICAN
HISTORY TEX TBOOK

The first book written to be
used to teach United States
history was published in 1795
by John M’Culloch, a printer
who had come from Scotland
to Philadelphia in 1774. He
first published an Introduc-
tion to the History of Amer-
ica, in 1787, but its contents
consisted, as he said, mainly
of “a collection of public pa-
pers, a short sketch of the
war, and a few other detached
articles,” and apparently was

history textbook (1492-1795).

236 OLD TEXTBOOKS

not intended as a textbook. The 1795 book was entitled A Con~ A

cise History of the U .S. from the Discovery of America till 1795.
It was this edition which apparently was compiled to be used as
a textbook. At least, in the preface of the slightly enlarged sec-
ond edition of 1797 its use was suggested “especially for schools,
and to such as had not time to peruse larger works.” The book
appeared under the same ‘title, but slightly enlarged, as a third
edition in 1807 and a fourth edition in 1813.

Since no author’s name appeared on the title pages of these
editions, but only the printer’s name, John M’Culloch, it
prompted the question of the authorship of the content of these

L books. This question has been answered in a dissertation written

by Alice W. Spieseke,1 in which she shows that it appears as
though M’Culloch copied all or nearly all of the content from
other printed sources. Such practice was more or less common
during that period, due to the absence of copyright laws. Miss
Spieseke, in her conclusion states:

Considering M’Culloch’s lack of training, it is remarkable that he
used as good sources of information as he did. The writer is inclined
to believe that this was a matter of chance, rather than the result of
research. He used what was at hand, which happened to be Barlow,
Webster, Ramsay, Gordon, and Carver, public papers of various
kinds, and almanacs. Of the writers, three of them——Ramsay, Gordon
and Carver———were accepted as reliable historians in their day, at least
by most of the people. (p. 104.) ‘

Yet it is rather remarkable that M’Culloch was able to piece
together so many borrowed selectionsfrom varied sources and
produce a rather orderly and balanced treatment -of American
history suitable as a textbook. In fact, it appears that the four
editions of his Concise History set a patternfor later American
history textbooks. They included treatment of eight of the nine
topics under which the contents of American history textbooks
have been analyzed, as shown later in a table appearing in this
chapter. Too, the percentages of the content devoted to the
diﬁ"erent topics correspond rather closely to the average per-

loch. (N.Y. Bureau of Publications. Columbia University. 1938.)

AMERICAN HISTORIES I237

centages for 54 texts before 1886. The chief deviation was a
lesser treatment on colonial history and more on governmental
matters. 1

AIMS OF AMERICAN HISTORY TEXTBOOKS

Most old textbooks contained a preface in which the author
stated why the text was written and what he expected the study
or use of it to accomplish. In explaining why it was written the
author usually mentioned something about the nature of the
content, how it was arranged, and how it was to be used or taught.
Such explanations constituted more a justification for the writing
of another textbook than for the study of American history, and
so may be called textbook aims.

Textbook aims. A lucid example of a textbook aim may be quoted
from Peter Parley’s First Book of History of the United States
(1848) , as follows:

The common method is to begin at the earliest date, and follow down
the train of events to the present time. The author of this work has
partially reversed this method. He begins with the individual states
of our country, and first exhibits their present condition. He then
notices a few recent events, and having ﬁxed the attention of the
reader upon the subject, proceeds to detail its history.

The same author, whose real name was S. G. Goodrich, in a
later and more advanced book entitled, Pictorial History of the
United States (1850), said:

Two plans have been adopted: one called the ethnographic, which
presents each colony or settlement separately; and one called chrono-
graphic, which blends the several subjects in one general view, and
carries them all forward with the advance of years.

He then proceeded to explain that his text used “a combination
of the two systems, so far as to secure the advantages of both.”

Other authors mentioned other matters about the merits of
their books, such as the arrangement of the material into epochs;
presenting the events of history with clearness, accuracy, and

238 OLD TEXTBOOKS

truthfulness; conciseness; use of maps, charts, and illustrations;
the use of side notes for the reader’s convenience; the use of
questions; the correlation of geography and history; the omission
of minor details; and its adaption for purposefulinstruction.
Thus each new appearing history textbook claimed some merit
to’ increase its sale.

Historical aims. Many purposes for the teaching of history have
been mentioned in the prefaces of Americanhistory textbooks.
These purposes were somewhat different in the earlier books,
where their usefulness for arousing proper attitudes in youth
was stressed. A few brief quotations will illustrate the more

i emphasized Virtues. .

1. Character training. The earlier books more so than the
later ones stressed the training of character. Emma Willard in
her Abridged History of the United States (1846), said:

We have, indeed, been desirous to cultivate the memory, the intellect,
and the taste. But much more anxious have we been to sow the seeds
of Virtue, by showing the good in such amiable lights, that the youth-
ful heart shall kindle into desires of imitation.

Peter Parley’s First Book of History (1848) said history “relates
to us what has been done by mankind, . . . (and) acquaints us
with the existence of good, and shows us how to attain it.” A

much more recent book stated this aim somewhat differently.
Guitteau, in his Our United States, A History (1924) , said:

History is the lamp by whose light we see human nature in action;
and we can understand causes. The signiﬁcance, the results of events
in proportion to our comprehension of the character of men or natures
conceived.

In fact, the purpose mentioned most frequently in various ways
was to present clearly those deeds which may properly be imitated.

2. Patriotism and good citizenship. One of the earliest books
to have considerable circulation was Hale’s History of the United
States (1835) in which he said:

It is the purpose of this work to exhibit, in a strong light, the princi-

AMERICAN HISTORIES 239

ples of political and religious freedom which our forefathers pro-
fessed, and for which they foughtand conquered; to record the
numerous examples of fortitude, courage, and patriotism which have
rendered them illustrious.

C. A. Goodrich (1828) said that the end of all reading, partic-
ularly history, is to make “good men and citizens.” Similar com-
ments were made by many authors. A much later book: namely,
Hamm, Bourne, and Benton"s A Unit History of the United
States claimed “the chief justiﬁcation of American history in
the curriculum is to stimulate the growing citizens of the nation
to think honestly and eﬂiciently about the problems of modern
life.”

3. Improvement of memory and thinking. A considerable num-
ber of authors, particularly the earlier ones, commented how the
study of history would help improve the memory, especially by
committing important dates and events. On the other hand, the
later authors stress more often the development of thinking and
recognition of Causes and effects. For example, Mace’s American

History (1925) said:

One. of the fundamental ideas in history is continuity. In every series
of historical facts the student must look not only for connection be-
tween the individual events of the series but for the connection which
this series has with some other series.

Freeland’s America’s Progress in Civilization (1936) said the
chief purpose is “to make a citizen better equipped to face reali-
ties, (and) to see their relationships to everything that surrounds
them.”

Many other aims have been mentioned by one or more authors,
but the above mentioned purposes were those most frequently
mentioned.

ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN HISTORY TEXTBOOKS

C. D. J acobs,2 who analyzed 54 American history textbooks

 

‘2 “The Development of School Textbooks in United States History from 1795
to 1885.” (Unpublished Doctor’s Dissertation, University of Pittsburgh, 1939.)

240 OLD TEXTBOOKS

published before 1886, found that these books were organized in
various ways in presenting the subject matter. Thirty—nine books
presented the content by chapters, 16 by periods, 12 in parts, 7 in
sections, 2 by epochs, and 1 by lessons. Thus some authors used
more than one plan. The most common combination was to divide
the book into parts and then to divide the parts into chapters.
There was great variation how minutely the material was divided.
For example, -one of Goodrich’s books (1850) contained 200
chapters, and another of his books (1831) contained 453 sections.

James Rial,3 who analyzed 64: books after 1885, likewise found
great variation. Forty-six presented the content by chapters, 16

g by units, 14: by parts, 9» by sections, 2 by divisions, 2 by epochs, 2

by topics, and 1 by problems. A number of those divided into
parts were further divided either into chapters or sections. West’s
text (1918) contained '70 chapters and 91% sections. These data
show very clearly that there has been no common practice in the
plan of organizing the content of American history textbooks.

NA TURE OF CONTENT

Jacobs analyzed 54: textbooks published before 1886 under the
following nine headings: aboriginal history; exploration and
discovery; colonial history; war content; travel and transporta-
tion; industrial progress and inventions; government and political
content; social, recreation, religion, and education; territorial
and westward expansion; and slavery. Rial used the same nine
headings and added the treatment of world relations as a tenth.
The average per cents of subject matter devoted to the different
topics by periods are presented in Table VI.

An examination of the percentages in this table reveals a
number of interesting facts, changes, and trends. There is marked
variation in the amount of average space given to the different
topics. For example, Jacobs found that before 1886, the texts
devoted nearly 45 per cent to war and over 19 per cent to govern-
ment and politics. On the other hand, less than two per cent of
the space was given to each of four other topics. The 6.4 per cent

AMERICAN HISTORIES 241

given to exploration and discovery was third highest. However,
Rial found that for 491 textbooks during the 1926-1942 period
only 18.8 per cent of the space was devoted to war. The per-
centage dealing with government and politics rose to 35.4: during
the 1906-1925 period. The later books devoted less space to
aboriginal history and more to transportation, industrial develop-
ment, social and educational matters, territorial expansion,
slavery, and world relations.

In addition to the studies by Jacobs and by Rial, which dealt
primarily only with elementary school American history text-
books, Caputo4 analyzed 87 American history textbooks most
commonly used in junior high schools. Although the primary
purpose of the present book is to deal only with old textbooks
used in the common or elementary schools, the lower grades of
the junior high school traditionally belonged to the elementary
level, so it may be pertinent to present a summary of his ﬁndings
about their content.

Caputo reported the ﬁndings under twenty headings rather
than under eleven used by Rial. According to Caputo on the
average the following per cents of space were devoted to the
twenty topics: Aborigines, 1.2; European backgrounds, 1.3;
discovery and exploration, 6.3; colonial history, 18.5; govern-
ment and politics, 13.8; foreign relations, 5.0; travel and trans-

portation, 3.0; industrial progress, 5.2; inventions, 1.4; eco— A

nomics, 4.2; territorial expansion, 5.3; war, 20.1; slavery, 3.4:;
immigration, 1.0; social aspects, 2.1; religion, 0.1; education,
0.9; recreation, 0.2; world peace, 0.8; and miscellaneous, 6.0. At
a glance, it can be seen that these texts devoted much less space
to war and politics and more to industrial progress and eco—
nomics, and particularly more to social and cultural matters than
in Jacobs’ study.

ABORIGINAL HISTORY

More than two—thirds of the books before 1886 devoted some

Textbooks from 1886 to 1954.” (Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of
Pittsburgh, 1956.)

242 OLD TEXTBOOKS

space to aboriginal history, while only 41 per cent of those after
1886 did so. One of Noah Webster’s books (1835). devoted 18.5
per cent to it. The nature of the treatment by those who included
it varied. Some claimed the original American inhabitants were
of a different race than those of the old world. Others thought
the American Indians descended from  the Antedeluvians who
survived the deluge. Still others thought they may have come
from Asia via the Bering Straits. Mention was even made that
some earlier people inhabited America before the Indians. Various
evidences, such as paintings and engravings in caves, mounds,
and earth works, and so on, possibly attest to their superiority
to the Indians. All such discussion, however, was speculative.

The attention given the Indians was often detailed. Many
books specifically named the more important tribes, particularly
of the eastern part of the country. Reference was frequently made
to their characteristics, manners and customs, government, and

religion. They were frequently characterized as “wild,” “treach-
erous,” “brutal,” “cruel,” “barbarous,” “uncivilized,“ “lazy,”
and as leaving a trail of “fire and blood.” Mention was made that
they would ﬁght not only the white men, but would enter an
Indian village of another tribe, While the men were away hunting,
and massacre the old men, women, and children, or make prison-
ers of those useful totheir nation.

Under manners and customs mention was made of their wig-
wams, dress, social customs, and habits of work. Goodrich in

1881 Wrote:

The employments of the men were principally hunting, ﬁshing, and
war. The women dressed the food; took charge of the domestic con-
cerns; tilled the narrow scanty ﬁelds; and performed almost all the
drudgery connected with their household affairs.

1 Even though the later books either omitted treatment of the
Indians or were less derogatory of them, yet the Barnes histories,
which were very popular from the first edition in 1871 to as late
as the 1920’s, were rather critical of the Indians. The Barnes
texts were really written by Joel D. Steele and his wife Esther
Baker Steele, but published by the A. S. Barnes Co. After de-
scribing the Indians as “brave and alert,” they referred to them
as “cruel and revengeful,” “lazy and improvident,” “grave and
haughty,” preferring “cunning to open battle,” delighting in
“ﬁnery and trinkets,” decking his unclean body with “paint and
feathers,” and bearing the “most horrible tortures without a
sign of suffering.”

Noah Webster (1825) described their government as follows:

The tribes of Indians were under a government somewhat like -a
monarchy, with a mixture of aristocracy. Their chiefs, called saga-.
mores, sachems, or cazekes, possessed the powers of government; but
they usually consulted the old men of the tribe on all important
questions.

Many other authors described their government in a similar
manner, except that several referred to the chief as consulting
with “counsellors.”

Their religion was described in various ways. Reference was

244 OLD TEXTBOOKS

often made that they believed in one “Supreme Being” or “Great
Spirit,” but also that their religion was idolatrous. For example,

Webster (1835) said:

Their religion was idolatry, for they worshipped the sun, the moon,
the earth, ﬁre, images, and the like. They had an idea of the Supreme
Being, whom they called the Great Spirit; and they believed in an
evil spirit. They had priests, called pow—wows, who pretended to
arts of conjuration and who acted as their physician.

Others refer to the Indians’ “dream of a Heaven of happy hunt-
ing grounds or of a gay feast where his dog should join in the
dance.”

DISCOVERY AND EXPLORATION

All except two of the books analyzed by Jacobs and all analyzed
by Rial dealt with discovery or exploration, or both. Emma
Willard’s book of 1859 devoted 27.2 per cent of the space to
this topic. Those authors dealing with discovery usually began
with the discovery of America by Columbus, although several
dealt with the voyages to America by the Norsemen. M’Culloch’s
Concise History referred to the discovery of America as the
“most important event in the history of the world. It brought one
half of the globe into connexion with the other, and caused great
changes in the commerce and politics of the world.” Butler’s book
in 1827 said the discovery of America would “ultimately be pro-
ductive of the greatest consequences to the world.”

Most of the authors in dealing with this topic did so by
devoting the treatment to the discoveries and explorations of the
Spanish, French, English, and Portuguese.

Spanish. Not all early explorers sailed under the flag of their
own countries. Several of the greatest explorers were Italians who
sailed for Spain and England. The explorers most frequently

mentioned as sailing for Spain were Columbus, Ponce de Leon,

Balboa, Cortez, Magellan, Pizarro, and Cabrillo. Many authors
played up the great wealth of the Montezumas and the Incas.
Barnes’ Brief History of the United States (1873) said, “Men of

the highest rank and culture, warriors, adventurers, all ﬂocked

AMERICAN HISTORIES 245

to the new world.” Mention was often made that these Spanish
adventurers were “cruel” and “harsh” in the treatment of the
natives, preying on their wealth and leaving a trail of blood and
bitterness.  

Not all of the cruelty of the Spaniards -was spent on American
natives. Sometimes they ruthlessly attacked the settlements estab-
lished by peoples from other European countries. One of the
bloodiest narrations was in Ridpath’s book (1880), describing
how the French Hugenots who had settled on the St. John River
in Florida were butchered by the Spanish under Melendez.

Other books relate how DeSoto tried to enslave the Indians,
and when they refused to serve the Spanish their hands were cut
off and other forms of cruelty imposed. Even the textbooks pub-
lished after 1885 continued to use such phrases, as “barbarous
cruelty,” “blood—stained conquerors,” “terrorism rather than
justice,” “ruthless plunderers,” in describing the explorations» of
the Spanish. However, the books do acknowledge that the Spanish
did colonize South America and part of North America, and even
founded colleges long before Harvard was founded.

French. France did not produce many explorers of note, but
nevertheless proﬁted by the discovery of America. The French
explorers most frequently mentioned were Verrazzani, Cartier,
DeMonts, Ribaut, Laudonniere, Marquette, Champlain, and La-
Salle. The French were pictured in a rather favorable light by
most authors. This may in part have been true because of the
help given the English colonies during the Revolution.

Even more recent textbooks included thrilling stories of the
fur trader, J oliet, and the Jesuit missionary, Father Marquette.
Although the French staked out magnificent claims to much of
the northern and central part of North America, they were unable
to hold most of them after the French and Indian War. The
reasons given in a number of books were: they established mostly
only fur trading posts rather than well populated settlements;
and the French traders, trappers, and soldiers were not the type
to sink deep roots in a new country. French farmers did establish
a substantial community in Quebec, but their ofﬁcials prevented
the freedom of the press and of thought, which in turn prevented
the community from growing strong and self—reliant.

246 OLD TEXTBOOKS

English. England’s interest in the new world was activated
when Henry VII commissioned John Cabot in 1496 to make new
discoveries in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. However, little was
done about them for three—quarters of a century, until Queen
Elizabeth’s reign when new endeavors followed. Then the exploits
of Drake, Gilbert, Frobisher, and others were ﬁlled with stories
of adventure. The early textbooks vary in their treatment of
these adventures. Some referred to the English as more humane
and good than the Spanish, while others tell of thecruel exploits
of the English pirates.

Later authors even more glowingly Wrote of the exploits of
Drake, and how he circumnavigated the globe, returning with
Spanish gold, silver, and jewels. Although Queen Elizabeth died
(1603) before any permanent English settlement was established
in the new world, the writers point out that it was England’s
uniﬁed hope to eclipse Spain and colonize in the new world.

The books also vary in their treatment of the relations between
the English and the Indians. Some seem to defend the English
while others present incidents of cruelties. For example, Ridpath
(1880) critically wrote:

Hostilities soon broke out between the English and the Indians.
Wingina, the King, and several of the chiefs were lured into the power
of the English and murdered. Hatred and gloom followed.

Portuguese. Little attention was given to the Portuguese ex-
plorers by the early textbook authors. No doubt, this was largely
due to the fact that they never established a foothold in what is
now the United States. However, several books mention the ex-
plorations of Prince Henry, called “The Navigator.”

COLONIAL HISTORY

All 118 American history textbooks analyzed  Jacobs and
Rial devoted some space to colonial history. The two earlier
books devoting most space were Keene’s (1822) 43.2 per cent,
and Peter Parley’s (18418) 70.2 per cent. The later books more

evenly devoted space to this topic, the highest being Eggleston’s
30.3 per cent in 1888.

AMERICAN HISTORIES 247

Little attention was given to the fact that the two oldest settle-
ments in what is now United States territory were settled by the
Spanish, St. Augustine in 1565 and Santa Fe in 1582. Reference
was made that the Spanish and French came here for riches and
trade, while the English ﬁnally came to establish homes.

Most authors made much of thefirst permanent English settle-
ment at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. _Attention was given to
difficulties of those earlier settlers caused by vice, laziness, reck-
lessness, famine, and disease, and how Captain John Smith helped
them improve their conditions.

Most authors devoted even more space to the settling of New
England by the Puritans. Several reasons may be given for this.
One was the fact that the Puritans came here with their families
with the deﬁnite resolve to remain here, which was not always
true in early Virginia. Another reason possibly was because most
-of the earlier textbooks were written by New Englanders, who
were more interested in and knew more about their own section.

Reference was generally made of the religious persecutions of
the Puritans in England, and also to the fact that they did not
permit religious freedom tothose of other faiths in New England.
However, the treatment varied in the different books on the latter
matter. Certain authors made much of the witchcraft trials, while
others belittled them. Even prominent members of society were
affected by the puzzling powers of imaginations and Witchcraft.
The nature of evidence brought against the accused bordered on
hallucinations. Stories of how the Devil tried to carry them off
were common. Grimshaw’s text (1843) said:

Bricks, sticks, and stones, were often, by some invisible hand, thrown
at the house, and so were many pieces of wood; a cat was thrown at a
woman of the house, and a long staff danced up and down the
chimney; and afterwards the same long staff was hanged by a line,
and swung to and fro; and, when two persons laid it on the ﬁre to
burn it, it was as much as they were able to do, with their joint
strength, to hold it there.

Ridpath, in referring to the most active period of Witchcraft
activity in 1692, said: '

Between June and September, twenty victims were hurried to their

248 OLD TEXTBOOKS

doom. Fifty-ﬁve others were tortured into the confession of false-
hoods. A hundred and ﬁfty lay in prison awaiting their fate. Two
hundred were accused or suspected, and ruin seemed to impend over

New England.

Further mention was made that the Rev. Mather expressed his
“thankfulness” that so many witches had met their just doom.

Social practices. In general, the earlier textbooks did not over-
glorify the early settlers. Their peculiarities and weaknesses, their
selﬁshness, and the strict standards that were set up, were all
depicted. No early author was so generous in treatment of the
Puritans as Fish in his History of America (1925), in saying:

There has seldom been a gentler and kinder group of people than the
Pilgrims. They appear to have had good will toward all men, even
toward the cruel king from whom they had fled and towards the
savages of the forest. They valued so highly the freedom to worship
God in their own way that they would not refuse the same freedom
to others.

The earlier writers not only commonly mentioned the witch-
craft practices, but also how the New Englanders mistreated the
Indians by ﬁring on them without just cause, cheating them, and
stirring up hatred rather than a friendly spirit from the Indians.

The social life of the northern settlers, these histories said, was
more equalitarian than was true in Virginia, where early marked
social cleavages developed. Too, the northern settlers were more
stable, having come by families, while many of the earlier southern
settlers were single men, not sure about remaining in America. As
a consequence, the moral habits were looser than in New England.

The earlier textbooks mentioned littl.e about such matters as
colonial amusements or culture. However, Rial found that text-
books after 1885 devoted some space to them. Recreation, hunt-
ing, house—raising and husking bees were mentioned. In the South,
dancing, music, and horseracing were common. Mention was
often made of the scarcity of books in the colonial period. The
Bible, the New England Primer, and an almanac constituted the
library of many colonial homes. The ﬁrst newspaper, the Boston
News Letter, appeared in 1704.

AMERICAN HISTORIES 249

War content. Jacobs found that 44.6 per cent of the content of
the American history textbooks published before 1886 was de-
voted to war. Interestingly the earliest texts, dealing only with
the French and Indian and the Revolutionary wars, gave even
more space to war. The highest per cent in any text, '7 9.6, was
in Cooper’s in 1800. The lowest in the older books was in Peter
Parley’s First Book of History, 19.8 per cent.

The later textbooks, as found by Rial, devoted considerably
less space to war. The average for 41 texts in the period of
1925-1941 was 18.8 per cent. Although Adams and Trent’s
History of the United States in 1903 contained 38.3 per cent
pertaining to war, yet Faulkner, Kepner, and Bartlett’s The
American Way of Life contained only 6.1 per cent. Thus the
textbooks have changed in their treatment of war.

The oldest texts, having to deal only with the earlier wars,
devoted considerable space to the wars between England and
France, particularly as they concerned the thirteen colonies. It
was not uncommon for the authors to deal with the terrible brutali-
ties involved. For example, Hale’s History of the United States
(1835) described the Indian attack of Schenectady in part as
follows:

Opening their doors, they (the inhabitants) met the savages, with up-
lifted tomahawks. . . . In a few minutes, the buildings were on ﬁre.
Women were butchered, and children thrown alive into the ﬂames.
The Indians, frantic from slaughter, ran, with fatal haste, through
the village, massacring many, who, in their attempt to escape, were
betrayed by the light of their own houses.

Such descriptions were not unusual. However, after 1850 the
tone was somewhat different. The authors would deal more with
facts, causes, men involved, and effects of war, rather than horrid
incidents.

The Revolutionary War was given considerable attention in
most books. The chief difference found between the earlier and
later books in dealing with it has been in the nature of its treat-
ment. The earlier books dealt mostly only with the war and not
much with its causes and results, while the later ones dealt more
with the causes and outcomes. The narration of battles between

25O OLD TEXTBOOKS

the poorly—armed and ill—clad colonial_ soldiers and the well-armed
and trained “Red Coats” of England was common. The authors
gloriﬁed the Colonials in their victory over the English. The heroic
ﬁgures most often mentioned were Paul Revere andWashington
as soldiers, and John Hancock and Patrick Henry as patriots.

The War of 1812 was termed by a number of authors as the
“Second War for Independence.” The content pertaining to this
War was usually a brief discussion of the battles fought, the num-
ber of men engaged and killed, and laudations of the Americans.

The treatment of the Mexican War varied more than of any
of the wars. Several books dealt very critically of United States’
part in it. Guernsey in 1885 referred to it as impolitic, if not
unjust.

Thirty of the 544 books analyzed by Jacobs were published be-
fore 1860, and so contained nothing on the Civil War. Those
after 1860 1 contained much on it. For example, the popular
Barnes’ history (1873) devoted 65 pages to the Civil War. The
subject—matter pertained chieﬂy to military campaigns, details
of important battles, number of men engaged and lost, and the
results.

Just why the earlier authors of American history textbooks
devoted so much attention to War cannot exactly be proven. How-
ever, certain possible reasons may be considered. First, the source
materials regarding wars were more abundant. Since battles are
sensational they are written about more fully than such matters
as religion and education, even though most will admit the latter
more important. Second, the earlier books were written when our
nation was young, and so the patriotic and nationalistic senti-
ments of our young nation found fuller expression in the treat~
ment of war than peace. Third, the authors likely attempted to
instill in the youth. of America the glory of the heroic. This can
be easily done by dealing with the heroes of war.

TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION

Only five of the textbooks before 1885 dealt with travel and
transportation as a topic. Less average space was devoted to this
category than any of the ten categories; namely, less than one-

AMERICAN HISTORIES 251

tenth of one per cent. The books after 1885 allotted more space
to it; namely, two and one—half per cent. All except three of the
64 books after 1885 recognized it as a distinct topic. In fact,
Lawson and Lawson in 1938 devoted 12.3 per cent of their content
to it, and McGuire and Portwood 12.4: per cent in 1942. 1

Several reasons can be given for this marked change in atten-
tion. Many of the oldest textbooks were written before the modern
means of travel developed, when peopletravelled afoot, on horse-
back, and by canoe or sailing vessel. Footpaths, streams, trails,
lakes, and oceans provided the highways for travel and transpor-
tation. As roads were developed, stage coaches and light vehicles
came into use. Later canals were dug to provide new ways par-
ticularly’ after the invention of the steam boat. Then the railroad
gradually replaced the canal, and in more recent times the auto-
mobile and airplane supplement the others.

INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS AND INVENTIONS

The treatment in early American history textbooks of these
matters was very meager. The average page space devoted to
these factors in the textbooks published before 1885 was less than
one per cent. No doubt, this meager treatment was due to the
fact that the period of invention was in its infancy and, conse-
quently, so was technology and industrial. progress. However, the

textbooks after 1885 contained fuller treatment of industrial‘

development, especially after 1925. The textbooks from 1885 to
1941? inclusive devoted an average of 6.8 per cent to these matters,
and those after 1925 nearly 9 per cent. Of the 54: textbooks be-
fore 1885, 30 gave them no regular topical treatment, while only
two of the 64 texts after 1885 failed to do so. Beard and Beard’s
book of 1937, The Jlfaking of American Civilization, devoted 20.5
per cent to technological inﬂuences. A

1. Agriculture. The ancient occupation of agriculture em-
ployed most of the early settlers and has continued to employ
millions to this day. According to the treatment in the early
textbooks the crops consisted both of native American plants,
such as Indian corn, tobacco, and potatoes, as well as imported
grains like hemp, ﬂax, wheat, peas, and beans. Since much of the

252 OLD TEXTBOOKS

soil settled by the colonists was very fertile, agriculture became a
source of livelihood and even of wealth. However, according to
Butler:

The expense of labor was high, and the labor of clearing their lands
arduous and diﬂicult; and above all the numerous Indian wars, to
which they were often harassed, distressing beyond expression; still
the rich luxuriant soil yielded them abundance for their support, in
peace and war, and a good supply for the purpose of commerce.

Farming became easier and also more productive after the in-
vention of the mower, reaper, cotton gin, and other later labor
saving implements.

2. Fishing. Noah Webster’s text stated that ﬁshing began at
Cape Ann in 1639 and that this trade developed rapidly there-
after. It was said that in 1641 more than 300,000 codﬁsh were
sent to market.

3. Shipbuilding. Commerce and ﬁshing could not develop com-
mercially without ships. New Englanders especially were anxious
to build ships, but were greatly handicapped by a lack of ship
carpenters. So house carpenters were enlisted to build ships,
which were small at ﬁrst. Later this became an important in-
dustry.

4:. Arts and manufacture. Reference was made in the early
texts to the restrictive laws enacted by England preventing or
limiting manufacturing in America. Since most colonists were
too poor to buy many manufactured products from England,
they felt compelled to make or manufacture their own salt, paper,
glass, shoes, hats, gun powder, and some farm tools. A loom was
to be found in many homes.

5. Inventions. Apparently the authors of history textbooks, if
they dealt with this topic at all, en oyed mentioning the products
of American inventors. It was said that Thomas Godfrey in-
vented a quadrant to aid navigators. Franklin invented the
lightning rod. In South Carolina a machine for hulling rice was
developed. Many authors referred to Eli Whitney’s cotton gin,
and Robert Fulton’s steam boat. In addition to Cyrus McCor-
mick’s reaper and mower, the threshing machine and improved
plows were invented. The invention of the sewing machine by

AMERICAN HISTORIES 253

Elias Howe, and the telegraph by Morse also received mention.

The history textbooks after 1885 listed numerous newer in-
ventions and then treated much more extensively the development
of industry and technology and what these have meant to the
rapidly growing power and importance of the United States,
which is now the most important manufacturing country in the
world.

POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT

American history textbook writers devoted more page space to
this topic than to any except to war. However, the emphasis in
treatment from the earliest to the latest books developed in reverse
to the treatment on war. The earliest textbooks devoted more than
half of the space to war, while the books for the 1926-42 period
used only 18.8 per cent for war. On the other hand, the earliest
books devoted only 15 per cent of the space to political matters,
while the books published from 1906 to 1926 devoted 35.4 per
cent to the topic. Abbott’s text (1877) devoted 492 per cent of its
pages to political matters, which means that from 1795, when the
first United States history textbook was published, to 1942, the
textbooks on an average devoted from 50 to 70 per cent of the
page space to the two topics of war and politics.

The treatment of political matters by the various authors
usually was under one or more of the following headings: The
constitution, establishing the new government, political parties,
international relations, and domestic matters.

1. The constitution. A number of the authors referred to the
constitution as the greatest political document ever developed by
man. Yet Cooper’s text (1800) did not mention it, and Mrs.
Thayer’s book (1823) devoted only 115 words to it, which read

in part:

By this constitution, the blessings of civil and religious liberty are
guaranteed to the people, and one of its chief excellencies is, that
it contains a provision for future amendments, as the exigencies of
the states shall require. One legislative and judicial power pervades
the whole union. The executive power is vested in a President and
Vice President, and the legislative in a Senate and House of Repre-

254 OLDWTEXTBOOKS

sentatives, all chosen by the people. The ratiﬁcation of the Constitu-
tion was celebrated with great joy.

Several authors referred to the explanatory essays concerning
the constitution written by Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and
James Madison. if

2. The new government. With the inauguration of George
Washington as president, the new government began to function.
Emma Willard (1859) wrote as follows concerning the inaugura-
tion:  

The ceremony of his inauguration was witnessed with inexpressable
joy. He made an address to Congress, in which he offered his “fervent
supplications to the Almighty Being, whose providential aid can
supply every human defect, that his benediction would consecrate to
the liberties and happiness of the people of U.S., a government insti-
tuted by themselves; and would enable every ofﬁceri to execute with
success, the functions allotted to his charge.” if

Many authors of history referred to the problems and confu-
sion facing the new government, especially the economic. They
referred to the ﬁnancial practices and principles developed by
Hamilton, and how the establishment of the credit system helped
strengthen the federal government and the rapid economic de-
velopment of the United States.

8. Political parties. Most textbooks devoted considerable space
to the part the different political parties played in American
political history. Of course, the earliest books dealt only with
the Federalists and the Anti—Federalists or Republicans. Since
the Federalists more strongly favored the adoption of the Con-
stitution, Noah Webster’s (1835) book stated:

To that party, the United States are indebted for the adoption of the
Constitution, and for the organization of its government, and particu-
larly for the funding system which has extinguished the public debts

. these great measures being opposed by the anti-federalist party,
with earnestness and persevering zeal.

The wrangles between the parties led Mrs. Willard in her text
(1846) to say, “The conduct pursued by both parties in Con-
gress, on this occasion, manifests how little party spirit cares

AMERICAN HISTORIES 255

for the public good.” Nevertheless, the Republican Party grew
sufficiently strong to elect Jefferson as our third president. This
party remained" in power for many years. Later the Whig Party
arose and elected Harrison and later Taylor as presidents. In
the meantime, beginning with Jackson, the Republican Party
became known as the Democratic Party, continuing this title
until the present. Then in 1860 Lincoln was the first president
to be elected by what is now known as the Republican Party.

Some authors also mentioned the activities of certain political
parties which never succeeded in electing a president. Among
these were the Know Nothing or American Party, which arose to
resist the inﬂuence of foreigners under the motto of “America
for Americans”; the Anti—'Masonic Party, organized to counter?
act suspected secret power of the Masonic Order; and later the
Progressive Party. However, one fact seemed to be apparent in
all the history textbooks; namely, that regardless of the names
of the political parties, only two major parties seemed to have
been strong at any one time.

4. Domestic relations. Nearly all early American history text-
books contained considerable content presented under the re-
spective presidential administrations, which could be identiﬁed

A as Domestic Affairs. These were concerned with such matters

as ﬁnancial lans for raisin revenue internal im rovements
9 9

admission of new states, states’ rights, Indian affairs, the tariff

question, and slavery. Generally only meager discussion accom-
panied the presentation of these matters. They really enumerated
facts of history to be memorized rather than to be understood.

5. International relations. Our country from its beginning has
had to be concerned with international matters. Nearly all texts
relate how we won the aid of France to win our independence.
Yet George Washingtion, the ﬁrst president, declared a policy of
isolation. Eliot’s text (1856) quoted him as having said on April
932, 1798, “that the duty and interest of the United States require
that they should with sincerity and good faith, adopt and pursue
a conduct friendly and impartial towards the belligerent powers.”
l\Iany authors commented favorably on this policy.

Another policy, which in part changed the isolation policy,
given favorable comment in many books was the l\Ionroe Doc-

256 OLD TEXTBOOKS

trine, although the texts by Grimshaw, Willard, Guernsey, and
a few others failed to mention it.

The following were the international events or incidents receiv-
ing attention in many of the early books: (1) Washington’s
Proclamation of Neutrality during the French Revolution, lead-
ing to the expulsion of Citizen Genet; (2) trade relations with
England resulting in J ay’s Treaty in 17 95; (3) Algerian pirates
plundering American trading vessels; (4) boundary negotiations
with Spain concerning Florida and Louisiana; (5) differences
with France resulting in the oft quoted declaration by Pinckney,
“millions for defense, not one cent for tribute”; and (6) the

_ controversies with Britain concerning our north—west boundary,

resulting in the Webster-Ashburton Treaty in 184.6.

CULTURAL MATTERS

Great variation existed among the authors regarding the
amount of space‘ devoted to matters that could be called cultural,
such as those pertaining to religion, recreation, social conditions
and customs, and education. Of the ﬁfty—four books written be-
fore 1885, twenty—six failed to give any topical attention to any
of these matters. However, Goodrich’s text of 1852 devoted nearly
10 per cent of the pages to them. Only an average of 1.8 per cent
of the space was allotted to these matters. On the other hand, the
texts written after 1885 devoted 8.4 per cent of the space to
them, and no book failed to give topical attention to one or more
of these matters. Lawson and Lawson’s Our America: Today
and Yesterday (1938) allotted nearly 80 per cent of its space
to cultural matters. A

Apparently the chief reason for the meager attention given
to these matters in the earlier textbooks was that American so-
ciety in those days was much less complex. Travel was diﬂicult

and towns were small, so contacts in large numbers were few. Too,

earning a livelihood required so much time on the part of most
people that little time was left for cultural pursuits, except at-
tention to religion. However, after 1885 life in the United States
became more and more complex, and so as the authors of Ameri-
can history textbooks began to give less space to war they gave
more to cultural factors.

AMERICAN HISTORIES 257

1. Religion. Of the cultural factors, religion received the most
attention in the earlier textbooks. This was due, no doubt, to the
fact that many of the earliest settlers came here for religious
reasons, particularly in early New England and in several of

the middle colonies. For example, M’Culloch’s text (1797) said:

America was settled by persons of various religious denomina-
tions . . . to New England . . . Congregationalists (Puritans),—-
to New York and New Jersey, Presbyterians,——to Pennsylvania,
Quakers,—to Maryland, Catholics,——to Virginia and Carolina,
Episcopalians. The Independents of New England, and the Ep-is-
copalians of Virginia and Carolina, fought to give ascendency to those
of their own religious tenets. Discord, and a degree of persecution,
was theconsequence. ‘

Too, since M’Culloch’s book was published shortly after the adop-
tion of the US. Constitution and its ﬁrst amendment separating
church and state, it contained an interesting statement concern-
ing the significance of such separation, in saying:

But each party (denomination) is left to support itself, and must
stand on its own foundation. Protection is equally enjoyed by all.
—From this new state of things, the world will be able to determine,
whether genuine Christianity is diminished by the want of civil, or
national establishments ;-—-or whether these have not been an hin-
drance to the spreading of the truth, and detrimental to morality as
well as to religion.

The meaning of this statement becomes clearer when it is rec-
ognized that the countries of Western Europe from which the
settlers had come had state religions. So this was an experiment
in church-stat.e relations. i

Religion apparently was a major factor in the regulation of
the behavior, customs, and life of the colonists. Butler’s A H éstory
of the U néted States of America (1827) stated:

Our ancestors combined a practical religion with the most scrupulous
morals, which laid the foundation for a set of customs and habits,
that operated upon society more forcibly, if possible, than the laws,
and gave a peculiar force and energy to their civil codes. Under such
a system, industry and frugality, patience and perseverance, mag-
nanimity and valor, with a practical display of all the moral virtues,

258 OLD TEXTBOOKS
formed the characters of the ﬁrst settlers of New England.

The deep religious scruples of certain colonists led them to
question the propriety of referring to the names of the days of
the week by the names derived from pagan gods. The same was
true of certain of the months of the year. So reference was made
that some colonists referred to the days and weeks by number
rather than by pagan name.

Many histories referred to how early settlers depended on
divine guidance by observing days for fasting at times of drought,
famine, or pestilence, as Well as days of thanksgiving for good
crops and health. Thanksgiving thus became a national holiday.

A number of the early books referred to the Quakers as the
lovers of peace, even keeping on peaceful terms with the Indians
and allowing‘ settlers -of other religions to settle in Pennsylvania.

  Not much attention was given to the religion of the southern

colonies. And ﬁnally, later history textbooks devoted much less
space to religion.

2. Customs. With the lessening of the strong inﬂuence of reli-
gion on the lives of people during the latter part of the colonial
period the manners and customs gradually changed. The change
was greatly hastened by the Revolution. In regard to this Butler
(1827) stated:

The licentiousness and corruptions of the armies, both British and
American, sowed the seeds of dissipation; the French army sowed the
seeds of inﬁdelity, and the ﬂuctuating state of the paper money
sowed the seeds of speculation and fraud; all which combined, greatly
lessened the force of moral virtue, and weakened the moral character
of the nation. 8

Other books mentioned the widening breach between social
classes, and how some became richer and others poorer. Too, how
the growth of cities changed urban life, and how certain inven-
tions and the development of industries affected the lives and
customs of people.

The textbooks published between 1850 and 1885 said very
little, if anything, about the manners and customs of the people
of the United States. However, they did devote much space to
war and governmental matters.

AMERICAN HISTORIES 259

3. up Education. M’Culloch’s book, the ﬁrst United States history
textbook, devoted more than four pages to educational matters. It
begins its treatment by saying:

Knowledge is necessary to the preservation of liberty. When people '
are instructed in the nature of their rights, they will neither be led
aside by artful demagogues, nor suffer their rulers to oppress them.
It is also a source of happiness to the mind; elevates ‘man above the
beast; and gives civilized nations a superiority over the savage.

It then continues by listing the dates of the founding of many
educational institutions in the United States, and by listing
charitable institutions, institutions for promoting science, national
societies, mutual beneﬁt societies, health oﬂices, insurance com-
panies, and certain American scientiﬁc discoveries, such as those
by Franklin, Rittenhouse, Godfrey, and Fitch.

Other authors referred to the strong early attention given to
education by the New England colonists, next only to the atten-
tion given to religion. For example, Butler’s textbook (1827)
stated:

The colonists instituted primary, or district schools in all their towns,
and obliged by law every county or town to maintain a grammar
school, where youth could be ﬁtted for college. They also ‘made such
provision for the support of these schools, that they were free to all
classes of people, and the children of the poor had equally the ad-
vantage of early education, with those of the rich. All classes could
read and write, and understand common arithmetic.

It must be said, however, that Butler overstated the case for the
status of education in early American history. The above educa-
tional conditions were obtained only in New England, and even
there the schools were not all free and it is doubtful whether even
all there learned to read and write.

Goodrich’s text (1831) said:

Scarcely had the American colonists opened the forests, and con-
structed habitations, before they directed their attention to the
object of education.

Hale (1835) mentioned the Law of 1647 in Massachusetts,

260 OLD TEXTBOOKS

which required every town of more than ﬁfty householders to
maintain a reading and Writing school, and the fact that “the
same system was adopted by the other colonies of New England”
(except Rhode Island). He continued in saying:

The effect of this system has been to render the great body of the
people of these states the most enlightened in the world. All can
read and write, and rarely can one be found not qualiﬁed, by educa-
tion, to transact the common concerns of life.

Hale, like Butler, apparently was unmindful that this was more
true as a wish than a fact.
A number of the early textbooks seemed to take pride in listing

I the colleges that had been founded in the United States, possibly

because soon there were more colleges here than in England, the
mother country.
One ofGoodrich’s texts (1852) said:

At the opening of the present century, the colleges of the United
States were twenty~ﬁve; now one hundred and twenty. Of theological
institutions, there are thirty—two; law schools, twelve; medical
schools, thirty—seven.

He further mentioned that schools for the blind, insane, and

idiots had been founded.
The textbooks between 1850 and 1885 devoted much less space
to education. ~

TERRITORIAL AND WESTWARD EXPANSION

The authors of the early American history textbooks ap-
parently were little interested in territorial expansion. Much
space Was devoted to the various wars involving England, France,
and Spain in their struggles for the control of North America,
but little pertaining to the expansion of United States territory
following the treaty with England ending the Revolutionary War.
Jacobs in his analysis of the textbooks before 1885 found that
only an average of 2.2 per cent of the space dealt with expansion.
Rial found that the textbooks after 1885 devoted 4.8 per cent
of the space to it.

AMERICAN HISTORIES   261

Apparently the earlier authors were more concerned with set-
tling and developing what the United States had than in acquiring
more territory. For example, the Congress under the Articles of
Confederation enacted the ordinances of 1785 and 1787 provid-
ing for the survey and government of the Northwest Territory,
which consisted in part oflands claimed by various states. Then
attention was paid to the admission of new states to the Union.
However, many of the early textbooks gave no regular topical
treatment to the Louisiana Purchase, the acquisition of the Flor-
ida territory, or the annexation of Texas, but usually devoted
considerable space to the Mexican War.

Charles Goodrich’s History of the United States (1823) de-

voted 16’pages to Jefferson’s administration, but failed to mention ‘

the Louisiana Purchase. However, he discussed at length the war
with Tripoli and the quarrel between Aaron Burr and Hamilton,
which occurred during that administration. Marcius Willson, in
his rather popular American History (1846), devoted just one

brief paragraph to the Louisiana Purchase. Egbert Guernsey, in

his History of the United States of America (184s'7), used only a
paragraph to deal with the admission of Ohio as a state and the
Louisiana Purchase. Apparently, the early authors of American
history textbooks considered the Purchase very unimportant, ex-
cept that it opened up the trade route on the Mississippi River
for the U.S.A. Even the books that gave it deﬁnite treatment
failed to deal with its territorial signiﬁcance.

The books even differed regarding the facts involved in the
Purchase. For example, Butler’s text of 1827 stated:

Spain ceded this country to France, and France to the United States
for 15,000,000 dollars. Eleven millions of the purchase money» were
to be applied to the demands of the citizens of the United States, by
Way of indemniﬁcation for the spoliations of France upon American
commerce.

Other authors cited different amounts as indemnity payment.
Grimshaw stated the indemnity to be two and one-half millions,
Quackenbos three millions, and Ridpath three and three-fourths
millions.

In contrast, modern authors either do not mention the indem-

262 OLD TEXTBOOKS

nity at all or make mere mention of it. On the other hand, they
deal with the Purchase at considerable length and make much of
its territorial signiﬁcance. Muzzey’s text of 1936 includes a
picture of the signing of the Purchase Treaty, a tWo—page terri-
torial map, and a sub—topic entitled, “The Signiﬁcance of the
Purchase.” The Woodburn, Moran, and Hill text (1930) also
includes a map, and speciﬁcally enumerated the acres and its
population in 1930. The Faulkner, Kepner, and Bartlett text
(1941) mentions that 15 states, in whole or in part, were created
from it. They then quote Henry Adams in saying that it ranked
“next to the Declaration of Independence and the adoption of

_ the Constitution, events of which it Was the logical outcome; but

as a matter of diplomacy it was unparalleled because it cost
almost nothing.”

Strange as it may seem, many of the early authors gave more
attention to the acquisition of Florida in 1819 than to the Loui-
siana Purchase. A possible reason for this was because the Florida
Purchase was preceded by a virtual war led by Jackson. Although
the treaty involved a ﬁve million dollar purchase price, yet this
money was not paid to Spain. It was apportioned to American
citizens, whose property had been seized in Spanish ports. More
attention was paid to Jackson and the war than to the signiﬁcance
of the acquisition. A

Most history textbooks published soon after 1848 devoted
much more space to what involved the annexation of Texas terri-
torythan to any of the other acquisitions. This was apparently
true because the authors seemed bent upon treating at length
the struggles and heroism of war. Thus the Mexican War was
given considerable space. Gruernsey’s 1855 edition of  History
of the U niteed States of America contained 29 pages dealing with
the Texas—Mexican aﬁ"air, mostly on the war. No question was
raised regarding the justice of it, and the treatment concluded
by saying:

Thus, the United States have gained a vast amount of territory,

stretching from the Gulf of Mexico westward to the ocean, embracing

NCWiM€XiCO and a large portion of California.

Willson’sAmericam History (1856) also devoted much space

AMERICAN HISTORIES 263
to the Mexican War, ending his treatment of the War, saying:

Such was the conclusion of the Mexican War,——a war opposed as
impolitic and unjust by one portion of the American people, and as
cordially approved by the other, but admitted by all to have estab-
lished for our nation, by the unbroken series of brilliant victories
won by our army, a character for martial heroism which knows no
superior in the annals of history, and ‘fears no rival in the pathway
of military glory. (p. 497.) ‘

However, according to Willson’s treatment of the whole affair,
the opposition to the Mexican War was not so much on its in-
justice as on the fact that it would add much slave territory,
which led to the northern opposition.

Some of the later authors dealt brieﬂy with the Oregon terri-
tory, the Gadsden Purchase, and the Purchase of Alaska. How-
ever, the majority of the writers of American history textbooks

seemingly merely aimed to state the facts regarding the various a

territorial acquisitions. The meaning and signiﬁcance of these
acquisitions were left to the readers to interpret.

SLA VER Y

Historically speaking, slavery has been one of America’s most
serious problems. It engendered bitter domestic controversy, even
helping to cause the Civil War. Yet slavery received little treat-
ment in the history textbooks before 1860, other than the acts
passed by Congress pertaining to its regulation. The early Writers
apparently did not grasp the moral, social, and economic signifi-
cance and meaning of slavery. In the books before 1860 less than
one—half of one per cent of the space was devoted to it.

In the main, about the only treatment given slavery was that
relating to its introduction into the colonies. Too,the books
differed widely regarding the data of its introduction. The date
of 1619 was mentioned bythe following authors: S. G. Goodrich,
Venable, Eliot, Doyle, Eggleston, Berard, and Thalheimer. The
following gave 1620 as the date: Frost, Guernsey, Anderson,
Scott, Lossing, and Holmes. Some failed to mention the date.

Other than the content dealing with the Civil War in the books
after. 1865, most of the other content pertaining to slavery con-

264 p , OLD TEXTBOOKS

cerned itself with brief treatment of such matters as the Missouri
Compromise, Fugitive Slave Law, Kansas—Nebraska Act, Dred
Scott Case, and Omnibus Bill. Although nearly all of the text-
books Were Written by Northern authors, yet most of them, even
those written in the South, dealt with slavery ob ectively.

MOST POPULAR AMERICAN HISTORIES

Early Histories: 1795-1825. The next textbooks dealing with
American history after M’Culloch’s, heretofore discussed, were
written by Noah Webster. In 1802 he published his Elements of
Useful Knowledge, Vol. I. The subtitle was “Historical and Ge-
ographical Account of the U.S. for the Use in Schools.” This
dealt largely with the colonial period. In the back was a “Chrono-
logical Table of Most Remarkable Events Respecting America.”
It consisted of fourteen double-column pages of detailed historical
events. Vol. II, published in 1804.4, dealt with the history of the
U.S. from the beginning of the Revolution to the completion of
the organization of the government in 1789. It ended with “Wash-
ington’s Farewell Address.”
These volumes went through
many editions. The 1812 edi-
tion of Vol. I was the ﬁfth.
Soon after Webster completed
his American Dictionary, in
1828, he published his History
of the United States. Its 1835
printing was the sixth edition.

Several other American his-
tory textbooks soon appeared
after those by Webster, but
none became popular until the
appearance of Hale’s History
of the United States in 1815.
This book, 3922 pages of very

ﬁne print, dealt individually with the history of each of the
original thirteen states, the Revolution, adoption of the Constitu-
tion, the administrations of the ﬁrst four presidents, and the War
of 181%. In the back were 94: pages of questions relating to the
content of the XXV chapters. It appeared in many editions even
into the 1840’s. Charles Wiley’s name was connected with some
of the later editions.

Another to attain popularity was Reverend’C. A. Goodrich’s
(1790-1860) A History of the United States in 1822. He was a
son—in-law of Noah Webster and taught at Yale for many years.
This was a larger book than those by Webster and Hale, having
443% pages. It presented the content under eleven periods, ending
with Monroe’s administration and contained many interesting
wood—cut pictures. A chronological table and an index were in
the back which was kept up—to-date in later printings. Few text-
books of that period contained an index. The 1834: printing was

A the 64th edition. Thus it was the most popular early American
history textbook. After Goodrich died the publishers produced

The Child’s History of the United States under his name, one
edition as late as 1884:.

American Histories: 1825-1850. One of the ﬁrst American histo-
ries written during this period was the Republic of America
(really an American history) by Emma Willard (1787-1870).
She was one of the ﬁrst women authors of successfulxschool text-
books, in geography, world history, and American history. She
became famous as an advocate of more educational opportunities
for girls. As head of Troy Female Seminary she made it an out-
standing school for girls. Later the title of her book became
Abridged History of the United States, which appeared in many
editions to as late as 1869. This book was larger than many of the
contemporary histories.

In 1832 William Grimshaw published a History of the United
States, which appeared in several editions for more than ten
years; and in 1833 Bishop Davenport’s History of the United
States was published. It likewise continued to appear for a
decade.

About 1835 Peter Parley (S. G. Goodrich), author of popular

266 OLD TExTBooKs

textbooks in several other ﬁelds, began to write a graded series
of American histories, entitled, The First Book of History for
Children and Y onth, and The Second Book of History. These
were very attractive little texts with many stories and pictures. In
1843 he published A Pictorial History of the United States,
which became very popular and appeared long after his death.
Like all of his other textbooks, it was illustrated with many pic-
tures and several maps.

In 1837 John Frost published A History of the United States,
which continued to appear for about two decades. One interesting
feature was an extensive appendix of 27 pages of fine print, which
included the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, pop-

A ulation data, and several chronological tables.

Other American history textbooks to appear in more than one
edition during this period were written by C. B. Taylor (1830),
J. Olney (1836), Marcius Willson (184.45), and Egbert Guernsey
(18457) . And there probably were others.

American Histories: 1850-1875. In 1854: Benson Lossing pub-

AMERICAN HISTORIES 267

lished A Pictorial History of the United States. This was a well
organized and attractive looking book with many pictures and
portraits. One objection to it may have been its small print. The
body of text was in 7 point type and the footnotes in 4 point. It
was one of the first histories to include extensive and interesting
footnotes. In 1858 Lossing published A Primary History, in 1864
A Common School History, and in 1875 An Outline History of
the United States. These books were used widely into the 1870’s.

Another author whose histories became popular was George
P. Quackenbos (1826-1881). His ﬁrst history was an Illustrated
School History of theUnited States in 1857. This was Widely
used to the late 1870’s. In 1860 he Wrote a Primary and an Ele-
mentary, and later in 1877 an American History.

In 1869 John Anderson published A Grammar School History
of the United States. As late as 1887 it appeared as the N ew
Grammar School History. In 1871 he Wrote the Pictorial School
History, and in 1874 an attractive Junior Class History with
many pictures.

William Swinton wrote A Condensed School History in 1871,
which received a number of reprintings. He also Wrote the First
Lessons in Our Country’s H is-
tory. However, these never be-
came as popular as some of his
textbooks in other fields.

The American history books
first written during this period
which enjoyed the longest ex-
tended popularity were writ-
ten by Joel Dorman Steele
(1836-1886) and Esther Ba-
ker, later his Wife. Their A
Brief History of the United
States Was first published in
1871. With time it became

The famous Barnes history actu-
ally written by Steele and Baker,
dramatic and appealing.

268 OLD TEXTBOOKS

more popularly known as the Barnes History, named after the
publishing company, the A. S. Barnes Company. It continued
in popularity in some areas as late as the 1930’s. It happened
that Steele earlier had written very popular books in several
ﬁelds of science. Evidently the history was largely written by
Miss Baker, who was a teacher of history, with the help of
Steele. When Steele, a scientist, was criticized for writing a his-
tory, the Company began to call the histories the Barnes His-
tories. The Brief History was characterized by its logical organi-
zation, human interest pictures, its blackboard outlines, large
type, and human interest footnotes. In 1885 the Steeles wrote

yPri'mary History of the United States, but it never became as

popular as the Brief H istory.

Other authors whose histories appeared in more than one edition
in this period were A. B. Berard (1855), David B. Scott (1860),
George F. Holmes (1870), L. J. Campbell (1870) and possibly

others.

American Histories: 1875-1900. Most of the popular histories
first written in the previous period continued in circulation in
this period, at least for some time. One of the ﬁrst to become
popular written in this period was by John C. Ridpath. His
Popular History of the United States was published in 1876.
Then he wrote the History of the United States, which was a
grammar school edition, which received numerous reprintings. It
contained many maps, some of which were colored; several colored
historical charts; and many portraits of prominent Americans. In
the back ﬁve double columned pages presented the pronunciation
of hundreds of proper names.   g

In 1888 Edward Eggleston published A History of the United
States and Its People, and the next year A First Book of History.
These books appeared in several editions.

Beginning in 1889 Mara L. Pratt began publishing a series
of American History Stories in at least four volumes. They dealt
largely with early American history; Vol. IV was on later colonial
history.

The last history originally written during this period to be-

AMERICAN HISTORIES 269

come rather popular was I). H. Montgomery’s The Leading Facts
of American History in 1890. This book continued to appear in
edition after edition for years, and provided the Barnes Histories
very keen competition. It was a little larger than the earlier
editions of Barnes. It contained its “Leading Dates” in the be-
ginning of the book rather than _in the back and it had an ap-
pendix of 96 pages. In 1892 Montgomery wrote The Beginner’s
American History, which apparently became more popular than
the Barnes’ lower book. Then after 1900 he wrote An Elementary
American History.

No doubt several other histories first written in this period
attained considerable circulation after 1900, but no attempt has
been made by the writer to determine which ones. John Mc-
Master’s A School History of the United States (1897), for in-

stance, evidently was one.

CONOLUDING COMMENTS

The study of American history largely evolved out of the ge-
ography textbooks. The earliest geographies contained consider-
able historical content. It seems that the interest in the study of
history was stimulated by American Wars. The ﬁrst interest
seemed to have come with our second war with England (War of
1812). Many history textbooks soon appeared thereafter. A sec-
ond great impetus followed the Civil War. There was a great
ﬂux of American history textbooks during the late 1860’s and
the early 1870’s.

The use of pictures in history textbooks was more extensive,
except in the earliest ones, than in most other sub ect ﬁelds except
in geographies. Portrait pictures were very common, particularly
of war heroes. It was not until after the 1880’s that the texts
began to decrease their overly extensive treatment of wars and
their heroes. Little treatment of cultural matters was given in
American histories until after 1900.

CIVIL GOVERNMENT TEXTS

M OST of the common subjects in the American school curric-
, ulum haditheir origin in Europe, particularly in Eng-
land. Not only did America borrow the practice of teaching the
sub ects commonly taught there, but even many of the early text-
books used here were brought from England. Such subjects as
reading, arithmetic, writing, spelling, grammar, geography, a11d
European history, as well as the textbooks from which they were
taught, had European antecedents. However, the teaching of
civil government (civics) and of American history originated
here after our independence from England and the formation of
a republican form of government. It was only natural that a
better understanding of the principles and practices of our new
government should be taught in the schools. Civil government
was not commonly t.aught in European schools.

included under social studies, certain errors concerning their early
development have persisted. The chief misconception concerning
civil government seems to have been that it entered the curriculum
of our schools about the middle of the nineteenth century. Wayne
E. Masonz found and analyzed twenty-six separately” authored
textbooks, exclusive of duplicate editions, that were published
prior to 1850 and apparently used in the American schools. This
refutes the frequently expressed opinion that the early schools
provided only incidental instruction concerning political institu-
tions, patriotism, and citizenship. 8’

Burke Hinsdale, whose book iHow to Study and Teach History
(1894:) contained a chapter on “Teaching Civics,” stated that
there was very little pedagogical literature relating to civil gov-
ernment. The oldest textbook to which he referred was Andrew’s
“Manual of the Constitution” (1874). He further stated that
“For a decade and more increasing attention has been paid in
our schools to teaching the branch of study called Civics and
Civil Government.”

Henry Bourne, in a similar book in 1903, allotted to civil gov-
ernment only two of the twenty chapters, and stated that “Civics,
like history, has only within recent years got beyond the stage of
utter neglect -or perfunctory attention.” The 1926 edition of
Monroe’s Encyclopedia of Education referred to the subject
matter of civics not having been taught in the schools until after
the middle of the nineteenth century. Similar statements were
made in certain writings of Charles H. Judd and Howard C. Hill
regarding the introduction of civil government in the curriculum.
Even Edgar Dawson, an outstanding authority on early social
studies textbooks, listed only seven civics books published before
1850. Likewise certain writings of Earle Rugg and of Clyde B.
l\Ioore greatly understated the number of early civil government
textbooks published in the United States. The latter referred
to the appearance of five before 1860 and a dozen more by 1892.

What was the true picture of the publication of civil govern-
ment textbooks before 1890? l\1ason discovered and analyzed

seventy published in the United States before 1890, all of which
bore separate titles, and thus he did not count the many editions
in which these books appeared. Chronologically, two were pub-
lished before 1800, two more before 1825, twenty-two during
the 1825-1849 period, eighteen during 1850-1874, and twenty—six
during the 187 5-1890 period.

Certainly there must have been a sale and use for textbooks in
civil government, else not so many books would have been pub-
lished in the field. Further light is thrown on their possible use
by statements appearing either in the prefaces or on the title
pages. Thirty-ﬁve title pages specify “For Use in Schools.”

Evidence concerning the rather wide usage of books in this
ﬁeld can be gathered from an examination of their republication.
The books of the following authors, arranged in chronological
order, were published in many editions: William Sullivan, Andrew
Young, John Burleigh, Furman Sheppard, Joseph Alden, and
D. W. Andrews. The Nietz Collection of Old Textbooks contains
eleven civil government textbooks under five titles, without a
duplicate, written by Andrew
Young, his I ntrodnction to
the Science of Government
first appearing in 1835. The
1854 edition of this book states
that it is the 24th thousand.

EARLIES T TEX TBOOKS

The introduction of civil
government as a separate
school sub ect probably began
in 1793, when Nathaniel
Chipman published a book en-
titled Sketches of the Prin-
ciples of Government (Rut-

in content for the teaching of
Civics.

CI-VIL GOVERNMENT TEXTS 273

land, Vt.). It is not certain that this book was used as a school
textbook. Its organization and contents, however, follow a text-
book pattern. In a later textbook in 1833 Chipman referred to
the fact that his earlier work had been “well received at the time.”
This may mean that his earlier book of 1793 marked the begin-
ning of the formal teaching of civil government in ‘'some United
States schools.

The textbook which heretofore has been recognized as the ﬁrst
in the ﬁeld was Elhanan Winchester’s A Plain Political Catechism

Intended for the Use of Schools in The U .S . of America: Wherein .

the Great Principles of Liberty, and of the Federal Government
are Laid Down and Explained by Way of Question and Answer,
which was published in 1796. This evidently attained some popu-
larity, for a second edition was published in 1802.

Even if these two books were used in some schools as civil
government textbooks, they did not present a well balanced civics
content. Both books dealt only with two of the six topics with
which nearly all later books dealt: (1) the origin and background
of American governmental institutions, and  the federal gov-
ernment in operation. No treatment was given to state govern-
ment, local government, common and statutory law, or inter-
national law. The ﬁrst book to give a more balanced treatment to
all six topics was William Sullivan’s The Political Classbook in
1831.

Even though these two books appeared early in our national
history, their use must have been conﬁned to a mere fraction of
the schools in our country. Most pupils attending school must
have gained their political education elsewhere or not at all. An
analysis of early textbooks reveals that considerable content which
can be classiﬁed as related to civil government appeared in books
of other ﬁelds, particularly geographies, histories, and readers.
The earliest American geography, J edidiah Morse’s Geography
Made Easy, published ﬁrst in 1784.4, brieﬂy described the operation
of the government of the several states. In 1798 Noah Webster’s
The Little Reader’s Assistant contained a chapter on “A Federal
Catechism or a Short and Easy Exposition of the Constitution of
the United States.” His Elements of Useful Knowledge in 1804

presented a somewhat detailed description of the operation of the

274 OLD TEXTBOOKS

executive, legislative, and judicial departments of the federal gov-
ernment, and of several state governments.

To the ﬁeld of American history, however, the study of civil
government owes its greatest debt. For example, John McCulloch’s
A Concise History of the United States (1797) devoted 85.5
per cent of the pages to governmental matters. C. D. Jacobs, in
an analysis of 54.4 early American history books published before
1886, found an average of 19 per cent of the content devoted to
political and governmental matters. From such humble beginnings
the study of civil government gained impetus and a place in the
American school curriculum.

CIVIL GOVERNMENT AIMS

The aims for the teaching of civil government were usually
mentioned in the prefaces or introductions of the textbooks, but
sometimes they were left to be inferred from the content, the
manner in which it was presented, or the distribution of emphasis
given the different topics. Since there were no professional organi-
zations then in existence to help determine the purposes and em-
phases in this field, each author was on his own in determining the
aims and the content of his book.

An analysis of the title pages reveals that most of the authors
were of the legal and educational profession. Several were minis-
ters, and a few were public office holders. Only S. G. Goodrich and
Andrew W. Young seemed to have been professional textbook
writers. Thus most of them apparently wrote these books as a
public service.

Patriotism. The teaching of patriotism, expressed or implied, was
an aim of nearly every author. One of the most emphatic appeals
for the teaching of patriotism was in Judge Joseph St.ory’s The
Constitutional Classbook (1834:). This was written while he was
a professor of law at Harvard. In part, he wrote:

If this work shall but inspire the rising generation with a more
ardent love of their country, an unquenchable thirst for liberty, and
a profound reverence for the Constitution and the Union, then it will
have accomplished all that its author ought to desire.

CIVIL GOVERNMENT TEXTS 275

S. G. Goodrich, who was better known by his pen name of

“Peter Parley,” wrote in his book, The Young American (1834) :

I have therefore sought to set forth the necessity of honesty in
politics; hoping to do something to restore to favor that good old 1
word, “so weary, stale, and unproﬁtable” to hack politicians—
patriotism.

Andrew W. Young, the most proliﬁc writer in this ﬁeld, having
written six separate and distinct textbooks aggregating an
enormous number of editions, wrote in his popular The Govern-

ment Class Book (1859) :

To preserve and transmit the blessings ofconstitutional liberty,
we need a healthy patriotism. It has been one of the objects of the
writer to bring to view the excellencies of our system of government,

and thus to lay, in the minds of youth, the basis of an enlightened
patriotism.

Other authors writing strong statements for the teaching of
patriotism were Edward Mansﬁeld (1839), Judge Story in his
second book (1840), Andrew
Young in his 1845 book, Fur?
man Sheppard (1855), and
Will Hart (1889).

Preparation for Citizenship.
Another frequently mentioned
aim was to prepare the youth
regarding the rights and
duties of citizenship. Sullivan,
in his Political Class Book
(1831) said:

Every citizen of a state is
also a citizen of the United
States. Being entitled to all

Young, a popular Civil Govern-
ment text, for schools and general
reading.

276 OLD TEXTBOOKS

the rights of national citizenship, and held to the performance of
all its duties, he must be presumed to know what these are.

Salter S. Clark, in his revision of Young’s Government Class
Book in 1885, stated:

The aim of this book, in supplying a want believed to exist, is to
present, in such form as to be used chieﬂy as a textbook for schools,
a broad and comprehensive view of the principles of government and
law in the United States (which are substantially the same through-
out the country), and thus to teach the young the varied rights and
duties of a citizen in relation to his government and his fellow
citizens.

Principles of Government. As may naturally be expected, the

8 teaching of the principles of government was the most frequently

stated aim in the civil government textbooks. The very first book,
namely, Chipman’s Sketches of the Principles of Government
(1793) contained the following interesting statement:

I do not know that any writer, ancient or modern, has attempted
to analyze the social nature of man, and from the relations thence
resulting, to derive the principles, which ought to be pursued in civil
institutions. It will, I believe, however, be readily perceived, that
this is the only certain ground of investigation, the only mode in
which any general, consistent, practicable principles in the science
of government can be established. This mode of investigation has
been attempted in the following sketches.

Almost a century later (1887), William Mowry stated in his

Studies in Civil Government that his purpose was to “set forth G

with great plainness of words and becoming brevity the history,
the principles, and the essential facts of our peculiar government,
local, state and nation.”

It may be noted from these two quotations that both authors
strongly believed in the teaching of the principles of government,
as was true of most authors writing textbooks between 1793 and
1887, yet their approaches were quite different. Chipman at-
tempted to derive these principles philosophically, while Mowry
approached them through a study of the functions and organi-
zation of our government after a century of operation.

Moral and Religious Teachings. Fewer authors mentioned the

CIVIL GOVERNMENT TEXTS 277

teaching of morals as an aim. However, several ‘of the earlier
authors referred to this as a speciﬁc purpose. Chipman (1793)
wrote that he would “pursue truth wherever it led, uninﬂuenced
by the weight on the one hand, or a spirit of opposition on the
other.” Winchester (1796) apparently attempted to counteract
the inﬁltration of European religious doctrines, particularly the
anti—religious feelings from France, by writing:

. . . let Americans beware of inﬁdelity, which is the most danger-
ous enemy that she has to contend with at present, and the only foe
that she has reason to be afraid of; as it aims at the entire destruc-
tion of all that is valuable and dear to us.

Maitland’s Political Instructor (1833) contains the rhetorical
question, “0, American citizens! Do you know, do you consider,
the value of the civil and religious privileges which you enjoy,
and are secured to you by our most excellent political institu-
tions?” Goodrich in his The Young American (1844) aimed to
teach the importance of keeping politics clean and moral by
stating:

The conviction is a very general one, that, morality and politics
are in a state of divorce among a large portion of our political
leaders. . . . If something need be done, to remedy this great evil,
how can it be better done than by beginning in that universal semi-
nary——the common school.

Thus some of the earlier authors of civil government textbooks
included the teaching of morals as one of their aims.

Miscellaneous Purposes. Several authors, particularly those
authors whose textbooks went through several or numerous
editions, mentioned the non-controversial features of their books.
Some explanations advanced were: (1) a criticism of other text-
books that appeared to be biased,  a defense for the objective

or scientiﬁc treatment in their own books, (3) an attempt to allay

the political tensions between sections of the country, and (41) an
argument for the greater sale of their own books. For example, in
his Introduction to the Science of Government (24th ed. 1854),

It is to be remembered that this work is, as its title denotes, an
“introduction” to political science being intended to teach ELE-
MENTARY PRINCIPLES, rather than to settle questions on
which the most eminent statesmen and economists are divided.
Most of these controverted questions have therefore been avoided.

Groodrich’s ‘popular book, “sought not to write a line or sentence,
with a view to party effects.” In Sheppard’s Constitutional Text-
book (1855) appears a statement that “there is no attempt . .
to deal With disputed points in the manner of a controversialist or
a partisan.”

Lastly, among the purposes stated by many authors were the
use or uses of the book. ToWnsend’s Analysis of Civil Govern-

rment (1868) is designed as a “Class—Book for the Use of Gram-

mar, Normal, and High Schools, Academies, Seminaries, Colleges,

Universities, and Other Institutions of Learning.” The terms
“elementary school” and “secondary school” did not appear in
the textbooks analyzed. However, such terms as “common school”
and “grammar school” were common. Many authors also men-
tioned the use for general readers, libraries, families, citizens,
members of the bar, and anyone engaged in business transactions.

CIVIL GOVERNMENT CONTENT

The following treatment is based upon an analysis of seventy
civil government textbooks published in the United States before
1890. Although many of these books appeared in more than one
edition, each title was counted only once unless the content was
materially revised.

For analytical purposes the total time span has been divided
into four twenty-ﬁve year periods, and the texts published Within
these periods have been grouped and subjected to comparative and
diagnostic analyses. The over—all analysis, a summary of which
appears in Table VII, indicates that nearly all of the content can

be classiﬁed under six ma or headings. A close examination of
the data presented will also reveal some clear trends in the content

of the books.

Treatment of the Origin and Background of American Govern-
ment. To provide a clear picture of the content classiﬁed under
this heading, the material was found to relate to ﬁve sub-topics.
The one receiving most attention during the first period related to
concepts, moral and ethical, which may affect society. During the
subsequent periods gradually these concepts received decreasing
treatment.

The second aspect with which the authors were concerned was
the theory, type, and history of law and government. This topic
received slightly increasing attention through the four periods.
Chase, whose Civil Government in Theory and Practice (1885)
compared and contrasted the government of the United States
with that of other existing governments, allotted over 81 per
cent of his book to this topic. More than half of the authors de-
ﬁned or described the more prevalent forms or types of govern-
ment.

A third sub-topic Was the
settlement of America, includ-
ing a description of colonial
life and government, although
treatment usually was brief.
In only four books did the
space allotted to this exceed
10 per cent of the entire text.
The textbooks of the last
period devoted much more
space to it than the earlier
ones.

The fourth sub-topic re-
lated to the Work of The Con-

tinental Congresses and the

A popular Civil Government text

Annapolis Convention. The ﬁfth dealt with the convention for
and adoption of the United States Constitution. Surprisingly,
twenty books failed to give even as much as a full page to this
sub-topic. The other ﬁfty authors devoted from one to twenty-
one pages to it.  

As the data in Table VII indicate, three or more times as much
space per book was devoted to background material during the
ﬁrst period as in any other. It is apparent that much of the sub ect
matter of ﬁve of the sub—topics was not deﬁnitely considered civil
government material by later authors. Much of it was rather
historical and highly theoretical in nature. However, it was not
uncommon in other subject matter ﬁelds for the textbooks to
contain mixed materials. For example, VVebster’s famous “blue-
backed” Speller included reading and other materials, and the
early geographies usually contained considerable history and
government.

Treatment of the Federal Government. The subject matter re-
lating to the federal government and its operation received more
over—all attention than the other ﬁve categories combined;
namely, 59 per cent. In contrast to the attention paid to back-
ground material, which steadily decreased during the nineteenth
century, the treatment of the federal government received in-
creasing emphasis. The percentages of book space devoted to it
during the four periods were 21, 51, 54, and 66 respectively.

The matter of the federal government receiving by far the most
attention in the books related to the powers and duties of the
Congress, averaging 35.3 per cent of the space. Some authors
devoted as much as 50 per cent of the space to these powers and
duties. Apparently they were keenly conscious of the legislative
body of our national government and how it functions or should
function as a democratic government. A

The sub-topic receiving next most attention related to the
powers and duties of the president or the executive branch of our
federal government, averaging 15.5 per cent of the space devoted
to the federal government. It happens that the Constitution itself
devotes 25 per cent to this branch. In general, the later books
devoted more space to this than the earlier ones. No doubt, the

282 OLD TEXTBOOKS

period following the Civil War, with a growing population, in-
creasing foreign and domestic commerce, changing social and
economic matters, all demanding the creation of new agencies,
bureaus, commissions, and other administrative units, helped
create a greater need for more executive or administrative duties.

Naturally, the judicial department received third most at-
tention, averaging 8.1 per cent of the federal government space.
This is the same per cent devoted to it in the Constitution itself as
written by its framers. Sixty—four of the eighty texts gave this
department space. Story’s book (1834:) used 54: pages to discuss
judicial matters. Being a judge, he was highly qualiﬁed to elabo-

‘ rate on the judiciary.

On an average, 5.8 per cent of federal governmental space was
devoted to the printing of the Constitution and its amendments.
Fifty texts included the Constitution, fourteen placing it in the
body of the texts and seventeen in both the body and the appendix.
In these cases, apparently the Constitution was considered as
formal sub ect matter and was to be analyzed as such. I

A discussion of the nature of the Constitution, and of the gov-
ernment set up under it, involved 4.6 per cent of the space. Fifty-
two texts dealt with the peculiarities of it and the federal govern-
ment. This was done in various ways, by such means as contrast
and comparison, or by deﬁnitions or explanations. Nordhoff, in
his Politics for Young Americans (1867), devoted 34 pages to
this category. Too, no treatment of this category usually preceded
the foregoing topics as an introduction to the details of the
Constitution and its provisions.

About 70 per cent of the space concerning the federal govern-
ment was devoted to the ﬁve above mentioned topics. The remain-
ing space dealt brieﬂy with one or more of the following matters:
relation of the states to the federal government; amending the
Constitution; and the rights, duties, and responsibilities of the
citizen.

State Government. Only 15 per cent of the space in all of the
textbooks was devoted to matters involving state governments.

.The average percentage space during the four periods was 44, 20,

17, and 14. It was during the second period (1815-1839), a

CIVIL GOVERNMENT TEXTS 283

period of western expansion, that the greatest attention was given
to this topic. Despite the fact that the operation of state govern-
ment is nearer to the people than that of the federal government
(and this was certainly true during the nineteenth century), more
than one fourth of the authors -omitted this subject from their
books. Calvin Townsend even vehemently opposed dealing with it,

saying in the preface to A Shorter Course in Civil Government
(1875):

To learn the duties of town, city and county officers has nothing
whatever to do with the grand and noble subject of civil govern-
ment. Such books on state governments have no place in the school
room. They would be nothing but a pile of rubbish. To attempt
class drill on petty town and county officers would be simply bur-
lesque of the whole subject.

This remark sounds strange indeed to twentieth-century ears.

Not only did 449 of the '70 textbooks include some material on
state governments, but the later books even presented the matters
of state government before those of federal. The first author to use
this approach was Elisha Howe in his The Young Citizen’s Cate-
chism in 1860. Jesse Macy, in his Our Government (1886), de-
fended this approach by saying:

The order of topics here presented is such that institutions nearest,
and naturally most familiar, shall receive special attention ﬁrst.

This became the more commonly followed approach, which was in
harmony with the developing pedagogical ideas.

The sub ect matter in these books relating to state governments
dealt with state constitutions, resume of existing state govern-
ments, legislative functions, executive duties, judicial functions,
education, taxation, election matters, public institutions, and
public improvements. No one book dealt with all ten matters, but
three authors dealt with nine of the ten; namely, Young in his
books of 184.46, 1848, and 1864; McKinney in 1856; and Fitch
in 1889.

More treatment was given to state constitutions than to any
other sub-topic. Sixteen books presented one or more state con-
stitutions in the appendices, and twelve others placed them in the

284 OLD TEXTBOOKS

body of the texts with accompanying discussion and treatment.
Pardou Davis’s text, The Principles of the Government of the
United States (1823), devoted 83.2 per cent of the book to the
treatment and discussion of the state constitutions of nine middle
states.

Next most space involved presenting a resumé of interesting
and comparative material about state governments. The data
usually included the date -of admission to statehood, the state
mottoes, term of state officers, and other miscellaneous infor-
mation.

Next in order of space emphasis attention was given to the

, legislative, the executive, and judicial departments of state

governments. On an average one-third of the state government
space was devoted to these three departments.

Only one-fifth of the space was given education, taxation,
elections, public institutions, and public improvements combined.
Even though education is fundamentally a matter of state con-
cern in the United States, since thefederal constitution does not
mention education, yet only 19 of the 70 textbooks allotted from
one to 12 pages to a treatment of the educational provisions of
the states. Only 15 of the books dealt, and then only meagerly,
with the problems of state taxation. The only book dealing ex-
tensively with taxation was Thatcher’s Outline Lessons in "Civil
Government (1889) in 20 pages.

Although 20 books mentioned state elections, the treatment
was commonly very meager. However, Thorpe’s Government of
the People of The United States (1889) spent eleven pages on
the topic. Public institutions were mentioned in only nine books,
and public improvements in eight. In other words, the technical
matters of state governments were given much more attention
than matters that concerned the cultural development of the
people in the states.

Local Government. Although agencies of local government have
sometimes been referred to as the “cradle” or “backbone” of
American democracy, only 27 of the '70 textbooks dealt with
them. Only two books during the first two periods did so. In all,
only three per cent of the page space of all books dealt with this

CIVIL GOVERNMENT TEXTS 285

topic. Those including a treatment did so under one or more of
the following matters: Village or borough government, municipal
or city government, and rural (township, county, or town, as in
New England) government. 8

The first two sub—topics received only meager attention, except
in the later books. In discussing the municipal or city governments
major consideration was given the “mayor—council” or “mayor—
aldermanic” type.

Rural government was given more attention than the other
two forms. Treatment of the town, the county, and the county-
township were all classiﬁed under rural government. The town
type of government prevailed throughout New England, the
county type was most common in the South, and the township
type existed largely in the middle and mid—western states. Most of
the books dealing with this subject largely conﬁned their expla-
nation to some one type of rural government. No doubt this was
a concession to the area where the author lived or where the text
was published. Two authors devoted considerable space to this
subject, which may be inferred from the titles of their texts;
namely, Rosenberger’s Civil Government of I owa and the United
States (1886), and Hart’s Civil Government of The United
States, and The State of Kentucky (1889). It may be said that
some publishers printed supplements dealing with particular
states to accompany the more general civil government textbooks.

Common and Statutory Law. Only 17 of the 70 textbooks devoted
space to this topic, but in a number of these the treatment was
rather extensive. The first author to deal with it was Sullivan in
The Political Class Book in 1881. He was an attorney, which fact
at least partially explains why he would emphasize an under-
standing of law. More than one—sixth of the book discussed wills,
contracts, deeds, mortgages, and even domestic relations as per-
taining to the obligations the child owes the father and the wife
the husband.

The author, whose books went through more editions and who
wrote under more titles than any other writer in the ﬁeld, was
Andrew W. Young. All of his texts, except one for beginners,

286 OLD TEXTBOOKS

devoted considerable space to law. In his 1864 edition of The
Government Classbook he deﬁned common and statutory laws:

Statute laws are those which are enacted by the legislature, and
recorded in writing, and are usually collected and published in
books. . . . The common law is not a code of written laws enacted
by a legislature,. but consists of rules of action which have become
binding from long usage and established custom.

A number of other writers of civil government believed that
the legal fundamentals of business should be taught in the schools.
Others enumerated and deﬁned the chief forms of crime, misde-
meanors, and their punishments as established by statutory

g regulations.

International Law. Eleven textbooks dealt with international law
or the laws of nations. Only two authors dealt with it before 1849;
namely, Sullivan (1831) with eleven pages, and Mason with four
pages. The two authors devoting most space to it were: Burleigh
(1849) with seventeen pages; and Young with 24 pages in 1854,
18 pages in 1864, and 19 pages in his 1885 text. It seems quite
evident that the textbook writers in the ﬁeld of civil government
before 1890 were not very conscious of the importance of under-
standing international matters.

MISCELLANEOUS CHARACTERISTICS

An examination of old school textbooks reveals many charac-
teristics not common among modern ones. One of these relates to
the nature of the titles of old texts. Commonly titles were rather
long and very descriptive. A good example of this was Andrew W.
Young’s popular text of 1845. Its title follows:

First Lessons
in
Civil Government
A Comprehensive View

and

Some title pages even included quotations; for example, excerpts
from Washington’s Farewell Address. ,

A second peculiar characteristic often was to include endorse-
ments, testimonials, and advertisements. For example, The Con-
stitntional Tea9t—B0ok (1856) by Furman Sheppard contained
292 pages -of testimonials in very ﬁne print, which preceded the
title page. These were written by superintendents of schools,
judges, governors, bishops, college presidents, legal writers,
attorney generals, senators, and secretaries of state.

Fourteen textbooks contained such material. Some of these
inserted a copy of a letter from United States Secretary of State
attesting to the correctness of the reproduction of the US.
Constitution as presented in the books. Others were testimonials
from persons who had used the earlier editions of the books. Still
others were endorsements by very distinguished men who had read
a copy of the book. Several of the latter type follow:

Monticello, Sep 26, 1823

It can not be doubted that it is advisable to make our young
people acquainted with the principles of our government as early as
possible.

Th. Jefferson
Ex—president of the U.S.

This was quoted in Pardou Davis’s The Principles of the Govern-
ment of The United States (1823).
In Joseph Burleigh’s The American M annal (1854:) the

following endorsement was quoted:

collated with the originals in the Archives of this Department, and
proved to be accurate in the CAPITALS, ORTHOGRAPHY,
TEXT, and PUNCTUATION.
David Webster
Secretary of State
W. G. Derrick
Chief Clerk

Nine textbooks contained dedicatory pages. These often re-

a ﬂected the idealistic sentiments which pervaded the early part of

our national existence. The authors evidently expected these
ideals to inﬂuence those who would use the books. An outstanding
example of this is in Alexander Maitland’s The Political In-
structor (1833) , which in part follows:

To JAMES MADISON
To you, Sir, as the surviving member of the august assembly
that framed the Constitution,
and of that illustrious trium-
virate Who, in vindicating it
from the objections of its ﬁrst
assailants, succeeded in rec-
ommending it to the adoption
of their country; to yo-u, . . .

In addition to including en-
dorsements and testimonials,
many of the earlier books con-
tained advertisements. Four-
teen textbooks contained ad-
vertisements either preceding
the title page or at the end of
the book. Commonly these

would list, and often describe, the books printed by the publisher
of the text. For example, Burleigh’s The American M cmual
(1849) listed (and described some) 54 books published by the
Grigg, Elliot & Co., Philadelphia.

TEACHING AND LEARNING AIDS

In some respects the development in the use of teaching and
learning aids in textbooks in the various subject ﬁelds has had
a similar evolution. However, in the use of some types of aids
considerable differences appear according to the subject ﬁeld.
For example, only 16 civil government textbooks include illus-
trative material, such as maps or charts, while nearly all old
geographies use them.

No one teaching aid was used in all of the 70 civil government
textbooks. In general, the use of teaching aids increased after the
first period. Of the 70 books analyzed, 66 contained prefaces, 57
tables of contents, 51 appendices, 4:7 indexes, 44 questions, 32
notes, 18 introductions, 16 answers, 16 illustrative material, 10
outlines, 10 references, 6 glossaries, and 4 summaries.

CHAPTER 9

PHYSIOLOGIES

 

EARLIEST HISTORY

HE urge for self preservation has made man throughout
history cognizant of the laws of physiology and hygiene,
consciously or unconsciously. Hieroglyphic inscriptions of the
ancient Egyptians evidenced standards for personal and public
hygiene. Later the famous Hellenic library at Alexandria con-
tained writings dealing with anatomy, physiology, and hygiene.
The Romans, in contrast ‘to the Greek emphasis on individual
bodily development, paid more attention to public sanitation, for
example, the water supply. Asceticism as developed under medi-
eval Christianity greatly lessened the attention to bodily health.
Thus the study of the principles of physiology and hygiene was
sadly neglected. Only the few who studied medicine in the medi-
eval universities gave the field much attention. Among the masses
occultism and superstition were too commonly followed. Physi-
ology failed to be among the “Seven Liberal Arts,” which largely
constituted the curriculum of medieval higher learning.
In the ﬁeld of physiology and health, as in several other fields,
a gradual change took place during the Renaissance. Many of the
famous Court schools of Italy introduced physical training and
play. Some of these schools spent as much as two hours and even
more to such exercises. Among the outdoor games were “ball

290

PHYSIOLOGIES 291

play,” and running and jumping. Soon other games and exercises
were developed. There is no evidence, however, that textbooks in
the ﬁeld were used.

One of the earliest signiﬁcant textbooks of anatomy was the
Fabrica H umcmi Corporis (Structure of the Human Body)
written by Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) and published in 1543.
This book marked the beginning of an epoch in the history of
anatomy, and so also of physiology and medicine. This repre-
sented a great improvement over the writings of Gralan and other
earlier writers. Other scientists soon began to be interested not
only in the structure of the human body, but also in its function-
ing. One signiﬁcant aspect of this was to deal with the circulation
of the blood. While a number of men concerned themselves with
this problem, the man generally recognized as making the greatest
contributions about it was William Harvey (1578-1657). In
1628 he daringly published his signiﬁcant ﬁndings concerning
the circulation of the blood in his Eacercitatéo de Cordia M oto.
Nearly all of these early works were published in Latin and were
not intended as textbooks to be used in lower schools.

One of the ﬁrst, if not the ﬁrst, popular textbook to contain
considerable content on anatomy and physiology was the Orbis
Pictus by Jan Comenius (1592-1671). This book was ﬁrst
published in 1658, and continued to be used in western Europe
for more than a century. It consisted of 154 short lessons, each
illustrated with a picture. More than 20 lessons dealt with animals,
birds, and ﬁsh. Nine illustrated lessons dealt with man, under such
titles as Homo (man), M embm H omi/nus Ewterna (outward parts
of man), Caput et Mcmus (head and hand), Caro et Viscera
(ﬂesh and bowels), Ccmales at Ossa (ﬂesh and bones), Sensus Ea’:-
terni et I nterni (outward and inward senses), and so on.

Some of the vernacular schools during the period of Realism
taught some science. Franke (1663-1727) taught anatomy in his
Pédagogium, and about animal life in his lower school. Basedow
( 17 23-1790) treated elements of anatomy and physiology in his
Elementarwerk. Later Salzmann (1744-1811) taught about ani-
mals in his school, and also introduced sports and gymnastics.
Thus the teaching of some science was introduced in the lower
school levels. However, apparently no regular textbooks of physi-

9292 OLD TEXTBOOKS

~ ology and anatomy were then written for use in elementary

schools.

The earliest textbooks of spelling, grammar, arithmetic, and
geography to be used in American common schools were brought
here from Europe, and many were reprinted here, but this was
not true of textbooks of physiology and anatomy. Although
several European written textbooks were republished here, they
were chieﬂy suitable for use in professional and medical schools.

AIMS OF AMERICAN PHYSIOLOGY TEXTBOOKS1

About seventy-ﬁve per cent of the nineteenth century textbooks
in this ﬁeld were Written by medical doctors. On the other hand,
during the twentieth century only about one—third were written
by them. The other texts were written by scientists, professors,
and others.

It is interesting to note the uses of the texts suggested by the
authors on the title pages or in the prefaces. Of course, since the
authors sought as wide a usage as possible, most books mentioned
more than one use. Most frequently they suggested use for schools,
homes, higher education, and academies.

The following were the most frequently mentioned aims or
ob ectives the books were to fulfill:

Popular/r Interest. Brigham in an early book (1833) stated:

He would again express the hope that his countrymen, and particu-
larly those who have the care of youth, would give more attention
than they have hitherto, to ‘the study of anatomy and physiology.

Cutter in a very popular text (184.47) stated:
The design of the following pages, is to diffuse in the community,

especially among youth, a knowledge of Human Anatomy, Physi-
ology, and the Laws of Health.

 

1 Most of the objective data presented in this chapter were taken from Helen
Barton’s unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Pittsburgh (1942), en-
titled, “A Study of the Development of Textbooks in Physiology and Hygiene
in the U.S.” She analyzed 62 textbooks published before and 19 after 1900.

PHYSIOLOGIES 293

Many other books contained statements concerning the general
value of learning more about this ﬁeld of study. Lambert’s Practi-
cal Anatomy, Physiology and Pathology (1851) contained the

following interesting statement:

The study you are commencing has become a very fashionable one,
so to speak. A few years ago some sentimental young lady would
occasionally be found, who thought it was hardly proper for her to
study the condition of the lungs and blood vessels, as if she had
not any.

Correlation with N atnral Sciences. Hooker, in his popular H n/man
Physiology (1855), said:

The relations, then, of Physiology to some of the common branches
taught in the higher classes in schools, are of the most intimate
character. . . . The analogies that exist between the human body
and all other living things, in relation to structure and growth, are
so numerous and striking.

Other similar statements appeared in other textbooks in the ﬁeld.

Laboratory Work. During the second half of the nineteenth
century some authors began to suggest activities and pro ects for
the students. In one of his later texts (1872) Cutter suggested:

As the study of objects is more simple and impressive than mere
words, and as illustrations are more instructive, particularly to
children, than written sentences, this work has been so arranged as
to be used advantageously with OBJECT study and TOPICAL
instruction, especially with Outline Anatomical Charts, both human
and comparative.

Steele (1884) strongly advocated the use of the microscope, and
gave directions in his texts for experimental activities. Smith
(1885) even suggested the “dissection of a cat or dog or rabbit,
illustrating the lessons,” to make the “text clear, and fix the
essential facts in mind.”

Prejudices. Superstitions and prejudices were common regarding
many matters involving physiology and hygiene. So numerous
authors mentioned the overcoming of prejudices as an objective

294: OLD TEXTBOOKS
for teaching physiology. In his Guide to Health (1845) Colby

said:

Let us strip our profession of everything that looks like mystery and
imposition, and clothe medical knowledge in a dress so simple and
intelligible, that it may become a part of academical education.

In his H wman Physiology (1856) Draper wrote:

It was chieﬂy, indeed, for the sake of aiding in the removal of the
mysticism which has pervaded the science that the author was induced
to print this book. Alone, of all the departments of knowledge,
Physiology still retains the metaphysical conceptions of the Middle
Ages. '

A number of the authors mentioned the overcoming of mystery
regarding the human body as an aim.

The Effects of Alcohol. l\Iore authors mentioned this as one of
the purposes to be fulﬁlled than any other aim. This was particu-
larly true of the textbooks of the latter part of the nineteenth
century. It was then that the VVomen’s Christian Temperance
Union became very active in securing many state legislatures to
enact laws requiring the teaching of the evil effects of alcohol and
tobacco throughthe textbooks of physiology and health. Thus
authors, in order to secure adoptions in the various states, would

claim that their books met the legal requirements. Thus the
Child’s Health Primer (1885) stated :

As this little book goes to press, Massachusetts, by an act of its
legislature, is made the fourteenth state in this country that requires
the pupils in the primary as well as in the higher grades of public
schools, to be taught the effects of alcoholics and other narcotics
upon the human system, in connection with other facts of physiology
and hygiene.

Some authors prepared different editions for different states ac-
cording to legal requirements.

In many books each chapter would have a section dealing with
the evil effects of alcohol. For example, Cutter’s popular Com-
prehension Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene (1884) closed the

PHYSIOLOGIES 295

following chapters with a section on alcohol: Living Properties,
The Framework and Its Coverings, Contractile and Irritable
Tissues, Vascular System and the Circulation, Respiration Ap-
paratus, Foods, Digestive Organs, Nutrition, Nervous System,
Special Senses, and the Larynx and Voice. Nineteen of the twenty-
four texts between 1880 and 1895 dealt with this topic.

CONTENT

The content of the early physiology textbooks evidently was
greatly inﬂuenced by the interests and whims of the authors.
Since many of the earlier books were written by medical doctors,
it can be understood easily why their books often were very
technical and difficult for the average common school student to
understand. Consequently in a number of respects the textbooks
written before 1900 were different in content than those after
1900.

An examination of Table VIII shows that the percentage of
space devoted to certain topics greatly increased while that of
others decreased. The stress given the more technical topics
generally decreased, while that given matters of health and hy-
giene greatly increased. The attention given to the structural
matters of the human body, such as the muscular system, the
nervous system, and the skeletal system markedly decreased. 
the other hand, the percentage of space devoted to functional
matters, as disease, exercise and fatigue, food and nutrition,
emergency and accidents, and growth and development increased.

Nervous S ystyem. The topic receiving most attention in the books
before 1900, and next most after 1900, was the nervous system.
Likely one reason for such marked attention was because the
nervous system has been recognized as the master of  other
systems. However, no prescribed pattern for studying the topic
was followed. The older books more or less commonly dealt with
a detailed analysis of the nerves, in some cases nine nerves, and
with an analysis of the sense organs. Often cross section pictures
showing the nerves or the parts of the brain were included. In
fact one—ﬁft.h of the pictures presented  all the books dealt with

some aspects of the nervous system. Only one textbook failed to
consider the nervous system. 6

The textbooks of the 1880’s and several decades following dealt
rather extensively with the effects of alcohol, stimulants, and
narcotics on the nervous system. For example, Palmer’s Hygiene
for Young People (1884:) said:

More alcohol goes to the brain of the drinking man, than to any other
organ except the liver; its effect on the nerve—substance is dead-
ening——paralyzing—as you have learned.

In Cutter’s Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene (1884) a rather
lengthy statement appeared. In part it said:

Alcohol taken into the system effects rapid changes in the working-
of the nerve-centres. When taken continuously, it impairs the nu-
trition of these centres. . . . Impaired cell-nutrition induces im-

PHYSIOLOGIES 9297

perfect, abnormal, or perverted action,——mental, organic, muscular.

Other textbooks made similar and even stronger claims concern-
ing such effects on the nervous system.

Alimentary System. The topic receiving second most attention
was the alimentary system. However, the textbooks varied greatly
in the amount of space devoted to it. Dunglison’s An Elementary
Physiology (1885) devoted thirty per cent of its pages to it. On
the other hand, four gave it no treatment. Apparently an acci-
dent in Michigan in 1822 resulted in a stimulation of interest
in its functioning. Alexis St. Martin suffered a severe wound in

his stomach. He was treated by Dr. William Beaumont, who be- .

gan to observe the processes of digestion through the aperture.
Too, he experimented by having Martin eat a variety of foods,
recording the results of his observations. In 1833 Dr. Beaumont
published the . results. Many textbooks thereafter used these
ﬁndings.

The study of the alimentary system commonly dealt with

mastication, the canal structure, peristalsis, digestive ﬂuids and
their reactions, absorptions, and defecation. Later books included
the effects of alcohol, state of mind and food selection, and the
effects of exercise, varying with the interests of the author. Some
of the more recent books began to deal with the diet. Richie’s
H nman Physiology (1911) included a chapter on dietetics.

Respiratory System. This topic received a more constant and
undeviating attention throughout the years than any other topic.
There was roughly little more than one per cent variation in space
treatment during the fourteen decades. Nearly all described the
process of respiration. Hooker’s H uman Physiology (1859) de-
scribed it as follows:

You can see that, if all the muscular ﬁbres in the diaphragm contract,
the arch will be ﬂattened, and thus the room in the chest will be
enlarged. To occupy this room thus made, the air rushes in through
the windpipe. This is inspiration. In expiration, the reverse move-
ment takes p1ace——the arch of the diaphragm rises, and, compressing
the lungs, forces the air out of them through the trachea. '

298 OLD TEXTBOOKS

Nearly identical descriptions appeared in books about sixty—ﬁve
years later.

Gaseous exchange within the cells of the lungs and the protec-
tion provided the lungs by the ribs were subdivisions receiving
treatment in many books. Other matters discussed were residual
air, carbonic acid intoxication, dizziness, and swooning. Some
authors also discussed artificial respiration.

Circulatory System. Much more extensive consideration was given
this topic during the nineteenth than the twentieth century. The
invention of the stethoscope by Laennec in 1816 sharpened the

y attention of the earlier writers upon the circulatory system. The

treatment of the topic became rather standardized in the texts.
The circulation of the blood through the heart and its control
of the valves, and the arterial, venous, capillary, and pulmonic
circulation were subdivisions receiving attention in most texts of
both centuries. Some authors discussed the connection of the
digestive and circulatory system with cellular nutrition. As early
as 1847 Cutter’s Anatomy and Physiology discussed this process
as follows:

It is through the medium of the capillaries that the operations of
nutrition and secretion are performed. They are remarkable for
the uniformity, of diameter, and for the constant divisions and com-
munications which take place between them. They inosculate on the
one with the terminal extremity of the arteries,‘ and on the other
with the commencement of the veins.

The more modern texts often dealt with the chemical composition
of blood. After the 1880’s some texts mentioned the vasodilation
of the peripheral vessels after consuming alcoholic drinks.

Skeletal Structure. The earlier physiology textbooks gave much
more attention to this topic than the later ones. Twenty of the
sixty-two texts of the nineteenth century dealt with it as Chapter
I. While the human framework has always been of interest to
man, it was not until Vesalius made a detailed study of a skeleton
procured from a hangman’s scaffold that a better understanding
of it developed. Later others began to discuss the marvels of the

PHYSIOLOGIES 299

healing processes which they had observed in fractured appendages.

Early authors frequently discussed in detail the anatomy of
the bones, including such matters as ossiﬁcation, chemical struc-
ture, descriptions of the ligaments, and the microscopic details
of the canals of the bones. Evidently the detailed discussions in
many books were too difﬁcult, and generally uninteresting for
the students. The following is an example from the Elementary
Anatomy and Physiology (1861) by Hitchcock and Hitchcock:

Of Synarthrosis there are four varieties: first, Sutura, the articu-
lation between the bones of the skull by ragged interlocking edges;
second, Harmonia, that between the two upper maxillaries, where
the bones with comparatively straight edges are simply placed edge
to edge; third, Schindylesis, or the joint between the vomer and
sphenoid, where the expanded edge of one bone is ﬁtted into a
corresponding groove in the other; fourth, Gomphosis, the articu-
lation of the teeth with the jaws, and so named since it resembles »
the manner in which a common nail is driven into a plank.

This is an example of the poor grading of the content in early
school textbooks. Writerstoo often thought only in terms of con-
tent rather than in terms of the children who were to learn it.

Other authors began to think of the hygiene and function of
bones. Cutter as early as 1854 said: a

If the bench is so high as not to permit the feet to rest upon the
ﬂoor, the weight of the limbs below the knee may cause the ﬂexible
bone of the thigh to become curved.

Jarvis (1848) discussed rickets, and several authors pointed out
the relationship between the bones of the body and the physical
laws pertaining to levers of the ﬁrst, second, and third class. The
texts after 1900 placed more stress upon the function of bones
rather than their structure-.

Skin and Membranes. This topic received little or no attention
by the earliest authors of physiology textbooks. In fact, four of
the ﬁve oldest books analyzed gave it no treatment. However, an
exception was Combe. In his Principles of Physiology (1841)
one—sixth of the book dealt with it. He bemoaned the neglect of

300 OLD TEXTBOOKS

it by other authors. He raised a question relating to the scarf
skin (epidermis) and its uses in saying:

Being homogeneous in structure, it is supposed by many to be
merely an exudation of albuminous mucus; and although depressions
are obvious on its surface, and exhalation and absorption are proved
to be carried on through its substance, it is still in dispute whether it
be actually porous or not.

He was concerned with the whole question of epidermal penetrabil—
ity by external substances.

Soon other authors gave this subject attention. The aspects
most commonly receiving treatment pertained to the protective

a peripheral covering, the functional properties of sweat and oil

production, the appearance of the skin, and its ability to assist
in temperature regulation. Several even warned against the ex-
cessive use of cosmetics as in urious to the skin. ‘

This was the first of the major topics under discussion to re-
ceive more attention in the physiology textbooks after 1900 than
before. It may be that the discoveries relating to bacteria by such
scientists as Koch, Pasteur, Welch, and Lister inﬂuenced text-
books authors. Dangers of infectious diseases received attention.
For example, Blaisdell’s Our Bodies and H ow‘ We Live (1910)

said in part:

The outer skin helps protect the true skin from poisons . . . if
there is a scratch or sore, so that the true skin is exposed, the
poisons may be absorbed into the blood with great rapidity. T

Muscular System. Eighty-nine per cent‘ of the nineteenth century
physiology textbooks dealt with this subject. In all, four prop-
erties of muscles were discussed by some authors; namely, con-
tractility, extensibility, elasticity, and tonicity. Of these the con-
tractile power of muscular ﬁbers received most attention. As early
as 1848 Cutter explained its importance as follows:

It is by their contraction that we are enabled to pursue different
employments. By their action the farmer cultivates his ﬁeld, the
mechanic wields his tools, the author his pen, the sportsman pursues
his game, the orator gives utterance to his thoughts, the lady sweeps
the keys of the piano, and the young are whirled in the mazy dance.

PHYSIOLOGIES 301

Extensibility and elasticity were illustrated by Conn (1906) as
follows:

If we stretch a rubber band, it becomes longer and thinner; when we
let go of the ends, it shortens and becomes as thick as before. In
somewhat the same way the muscles of the body are shortened, the
muscle growing thicker as it contracts.

Tonicity was not discussed until the more recent books ap-
peared. Fatigue and the effects of alcohol and narcotics also were
given fuller treatment in the later books. The earlier books had
dealt more fully with the structure and location of muscles, while
the later ones discussed the hygiene of the muscular system and
its functioning during work and physical exercises.

Food and Nutrition. This topic was given more than twice the
percentage of space in the texts after 1900 than before. More
than one—fourth of the texts before 1900 Omitted it. Since such
a large fraction of the population before 1900 lived either on
farms or in small towns where it was common to have gardens, the
supply of food, and its quality, were not so critical as after 1900,
when urbanization required the masses to buy their food. Con-
sequently the nutritional value of the various types of food, and
their relative costs, became a matter of serious concern, especially
of urban dwellers. Thus charts of food values, calorie content,

and balanced diets appeared. Even refrigeration of foods received

attention.

Alcohol, Narcotics, and Stimulants. This was the last topic to
have received more than an average of four per cent attention

. in the texts before 1900. However, most of this attention was

given during the last two decades. Twenty—eight of the thirty-
nine texts before 1883 failed to discuss this general subject. On
the other "hand, only four of the twenty—three between 1883 and
1900 omitted it. Nine of the twenty-three devoted more than
twenty per cent of their space to it. This was largely due to the
efforts of the W.C.T.U. in securing the enactment of state laws
requiring the teaching of the harmful effects of alcohol and
narcotics. Two books devoted more than forty per cent of space

302 OLD TEXTBOOKS

to these effects. While only one text after 1900 omitted the topic,
only one gave it more than nine per cent space.

Other Topics. The following topics were given less than two per
cent average space in the texts before 1900: Animal heat, dis-
ease, growth and development, excretory system, glandular sys-
tem, emergencies, moral education, directions for nurses, repro-
ductive system, and sex education. Exercise and fatigue were
given 2.34: per cent space.

CHANGES IN TEX-TBOOKS

l\Iarked changes took place in the physiology textbooks after
1900 in their lessened attention to certain topics and their greatly
increased attention to others. The topics receiving lessened atten-
tion in the later books were the muscular system, the nervous
system, and the skeletal system. These were treated rather factu~
ally and technically in most of the earlier textbooks. More early
attention was given to structural matters rather than how these
systems functioned. Many of the technical facts apparently were
to be committed to memory by the students.

On the other hand, at least five topics received markedly in-
creased attention in the texts after 1900. Treatment of exercise,
fatigue, and rest increased from 2.34 per cent to 5.9 per cent in
average space; food and nutrition from 45.19 per cent to 9.03 per
cent; disease from 1.744 per cent to 13.00 per cent; emergency
and accident from 0.7 8 per cent to 6.61 per cent; and growth and
development from 1.72 per cent to 5.3 per cent. It may be noted
that these topics dealt more with functions and care relating
to health and well being of children rather than structural
matters. The later writers thought more in terms of the physical
needs of boys and girls rather than the mastery of technical
subject matter. ~

PHYSIOLOGIES BEFORE 1860

Physiology did not become a common subject for study in
What is now the public school level at a very early date. In fact,

PHYSIOLOGIES 303»-

it was one of the last content subjects to gain acceptance in the
common schools. The earliest physiology textbooks seem to have
been used largely only in medical schools. Apparently it was not
until after Horace l\Iann, while head of the public schools in
Massachusetts, began in the 184LO’s to advocate strongly the study
of physiology and hygiene that it gradually was added to the
school curriculum. As evidence of its lesser popularity, the Writer’s
collection contains about 900 readers published before 1900, but
only a few over 100 physiologies. These were Written by 56
different authors. Even many of these were intended for use in
higher education. ~

The oldest of these was a Manual of the Physiology of M an
by Ph. Hutin, originally in French, translated into English by
Joseph Togno, and reprinted in Philadelphia in 1828. This was
intended for use in medical schools. The organization of its
contents was very interesting. After an introductory chapter of
34 pages of definitions and explanations, the other parts Were:

FIRST CLASS
Life of the Individual
FIRST ORDER

Functions of Secretion

FIRST CLASS
SECOND ORDER

Functions of Relation
Functions which are subservient to the preservation of the species.

SECOND CLASS

It contained much technical material. The last part contained
material of an intimate nature which certainly could not have been
taught to children. The book was bound in leather.

One of the first, if not the first, physiology written for children
in America was W. A. Alcott’s The H ouse I Live In (1834:). Ap-

parently this book gained little acceptance as a textbook.

J. L. Comstoclc. The first physiology school textbook to gain
considerable usage was written by Comstock. He already was the
author of textbooks in mineralogy, natural philosophy (physics),

304 OLD TEXTBOOKS

chemistry, botany, and geology. He was America’s ﬁrst proliﬁc
textbook writer in the sciences. In 1836 his Outlines of Physiology
appeared. It was intended for “Use in Schools and Heads of
Families.” In justification for this book he quoted a Dr. Dick as
follows:

It is somewhat unaccountable, and not a little inconsistent, that
while we direct the young to look abroad over the surface of the
earth, and survey its mountains, rivers, . . . that we should never
teach them to look into themselves, to consider their own corporeal
structures, the numerous parts of which they are composed; . . . and
the lessons of practical instruction which may be derived from
such contemplations.

Comstock aimed to fulﬁll these purposes by “adapting his lan-
guage and manner to the understanding of youth.” He partic-
ularly wanted the text to be useful, “especially that of females, to
the preservation of their forms and their health, by avoiding
habits and fashions, which at once deform their persons and ruin
their constitutions.”

This book consisted of 310
pages, which included many
pictures. The contents con-
sisted of six parts: I. Me-
chanical Functions; II, Verte-
brated Animals; III, Animal
Functions; IV, Circulation of
the Blood; V, Sensorial F unc-
tions; and VI, Mental and
Physical Exercise. The topic
titles under the first three
parts reveal that half of the
book was really general biol-
ogy, and only the second half

Comstock, 1836, “to be useful to
youth, and especially to females
. . . by avoiding fashions which
deform and ruin.”

PHYSIOLOGIES 305

of the book dealt with human physiology. This book appeared in
several editions. An appendix of 40 pages dealt with the “Descrip-
tion of the Attitudes” (Posture), which discussed the proper
bodily positions in standing, walking, and sitting, as well as the
effects of tight lacing, and other similar matters.

The above book was recopyrighted in 1847 with the title
changed to Physiology Both Comparative and Human. However,
its contents were identical with the 1836 edition, except that ﬁve
pages were added dealing with the “predisposition to consump-
tion” and exercise of the lungs. This edition also appeared in
several reprintings.

Physiologies of the 18[;0’s. The success of Comstock’s text, plus
the advocacy of the teaching of physiology by Horace Mann,
apparently aroused a number of authors t.o write physiology
textbooks during the 1840’s. Books written by Combe (1840),
Colby (1844), Griscom (1845), Cutter (1846), Nichols (1846),
Jarvis (1847), and Hamilton (1849) appeared. However, only
the books by Cutter gained wide circulation. So only a few words
need be said about some characteristic features of several of them.

Combe’s Principles of Physiology was first written in Scotland
and then reprinted in New York in 1840. This book was the ﬁrst
to devote extensive attention to the structure and functions of
the skin. Colby’s Guide to Health dealt more fully with matters
pertaining to health and disease rather than the technical and
structural matters of the body. Griscom’s First Lessons in Hu-
man Physiology was a very elementary and attractive little book.
It went through several reprintings. Jarvis published a Practical
Physiology in 1847, and a Primary Physiology in 1848. The
former was a rather large book of 400 pages of ﬁne print, while
the latter was a small and rather attractive book with numerous
pictures. In 1849 Hamilton’s Elements of Vegetable and Animal
Physiology, originally printed in Edinburgh, Scotland (1844),
was reprinted in New York. This was a rather technical book of
biology, dealing only in part with man.

Calvin Cutter. Cutter’s physiology textbooks apparently became
the most widely used of any written before 1900. The writer’s

306 OLD TEXTBOOKS

collection contains fourteen different books under six titles. The
first one was published in 1846 and the latest in 1888. He served
as a professor of physiology in several universities.

His first text was an Anatomy and Physiology (1846). It was
“designed for Academies and Families.” He too quoted the same
Dr. Dick as Comstock as the reason for writing it. Its purpose
was to “diﬁcuse in the community, especially among youth, a
knowledge of Human Anatomy, Physiology, and the Laws of
Health.” He presented the structure of organs, their functions,
and matters of hygiene and health. It contained more than 200
engravings. It also had a glossary in the back. This book went
through several printings.

In 1852 he published his Treatise on Anatomy, Physiology,
and Hygiene, “designed for Colleges, Academies, and Families.”
It was much larger than his 1846 text, and contained 150 engrav-
ings. It appeared in numerous printings. Several hundred thou-
sand c-opies of these were sold. In 1854 a small text, entitled
H nman and Comparative Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene, by
Mrs. Eunice P. Cutter appeared. She was Calvin’s wife, and the
book was printed by the same publisher as Calvin’s 1852 book. It
was an attractive and simple one with 100 engravings. It deﬁnitely
was an elementary physiology. Evidently it had considerable cir-
culation. ,

To satisfy his publishers, in 1870 Cutter thoroughly revised
and remodeled his 1852 text. The new title became New Analytic
Anatomy, Physiology and Hygiene. By this late date he was not
merely concerned with the contents of such a work, but also how
it should be taught. On a page addressed “To Teachers,” he
suggested that the method be “Analytical, with Synthetical Re-
views,” and so on. He aimed to make the anatomy and physiology
more concise and definite, the hygiene plain and practical, and
to introduce comparative anatomy. The glossary was enlarged.

In 1871-1872 Cutter decided to publish a two-book series, so
he prepared a First Book on Analytical Anatomy, Physiology
and Hygiene for “Common and Grammar Schools and for
Families,” and a Second Book for “Academies, Grammar Schools
and Families.” The organization and table of contents were nearly
identical except that the Second contained chapters on General

PHYSIOLOGIES 307

Histology and General Chemistry not included in the First. The
Second Book was more than 100 pages "larger.

Apparently to continue to proﬁt from the reputation of Calvin
Cutter as a physiology textbook author, the son, John C. Cutter,
wrote the Comprehensi*oe Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene
in 1884. This was intended for the upper grades and secondary
schools. The next year he published Lessons in Hygiene, an “Ele-
mentary Textbook on the Maintenance of Health.” On the title
pages of both books reference was made to “Lessons on the
Action of Stimulants and Sedatives.” The earlier Cutter books
did not contain such lessons. Beginning in the 1880’s such lessons
were required in some states.

It may be asked why the Cutter physiologies continued to be
so popular. One reason may be because one revision followed the
other to keep them up—to—date. However, other reasons were that
they kept a balanced presentation among the content relating to
the structure of the organs of the body, the functioning of them,
and lastly their care so as to maintain health. Also each of these
books contained a hundred or more pictures and illustrations.
Then, too, the pupils and teachers were guided by the inclusion
of questions. In the earlier books the questions were at the bottom
of every page. In the Analytic text 60 pages in the back of the
book were devoted to an “Analytic Examination,” chapter by
chapter. Cutter made his books teachable and learnable.

Worthington H ooker (1806-1867) The most successful physiol-
ogy to appear ﬁrst in the 1850’s was Hooker’s H n-man Physiology
in 1854. After receiving a medical degree from Harvard in 1829,
he devoted much time to Writing medical books. He also Wrote
textbooks in natural history, chemistry, physics, geology, and
nature study.

His Human Physiology was designed for colleges and the
higher classes in schools. It was reprinted many times through
the 50’s and 60’s. The style was that of a lecturer. He claimed
to have thought of the readers of this book as his audience, and
thus was lecturing to them. The appendix of 34 pages dealt with
directions to teachers and included questions. Nearly 200 en-
gravings were included.

303 OLD TEXTBOOKS

In 1874: his book was revised by J. A. Sewall as Hooker’s New
Physiology. This book -was smaller, less technical, and organized
better pedagogically. It could well have been used at a lower
level than the earlier one. It also went through reprintings.

OTHER PH YSIOLOGIES OF THE 1850’S

In 1850 the Practical Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathology;
Hygiene and Therapeutics by T. S. Lambert was published. He
classiﬁed the bodily organs into First and Second Class. Under
the First Class were the organs of thought, feeling, voluntary
motion, and sensation. Under the Second Class were those of
digestion, circulation, respiration, temperature control, and ex-

cretion. It included many pictures, ﬁve being colored. This was
the first physiology to use colored plates. Lambert also wrote
the Pictorial Physiology, a small book for young children of
96 pages and sold for 371/2 cents; and a large text entitled Pop-
ular Anatomy and Physiology. Also in 1850 Fowle’s Human
Physiology was published. This was a treatise of 180 pages ex-
plaining Fowle’s “Series of Eight Diagrams,” prepared for use
by parents and teachers illustrating parts of the body.

Hollick’s American Class—Book of Anatomy and Physiology
was published in 1853. It was a rather small book printed in
large type and contained ninety engravings. Questions followed
each of the rather small chapters. In 1856 Draper’s Human
Physiology, Statistical and Dynamical appeared. This was a
large book of 649 pages. It was based on the Lectures on Physi-
ology he had been giving in the University of New York. 1

In 1854 Comings published his Class—Book of Physiology. This
was a well illustrated and carefully organized book, intended “for
the major portion of our schools.” It contained a glossary and
index of 18 pages. It was intended to precede his Principles of
Physiology, which was a larger and more difficult book and
adapted to more advanced institutions.

In 1859 the Illustrated Self-Instructor in Phrenology and
Physiology by O. S. and L. S. Fowler was published. A “Charac-
ter Chart” began the book. A picture of the cranium showed the
cranial seat or location of 37 character traits. Likely this book
was not used as a regular physiology textbook in the schools,
except possibly as a reference work by some teachers. 1

PH Y SI OLOGI ES, 1 860-1 880

J. C. Dalton. The first physiology textbook to attain considerable
circulation during this period was Dalton’s A Treatise on Physi-
ology and Hygiene in 1868. In the Introduction he stated:

Physiology is a science which teaches us the natural actions of the
living body, and the manner in which they are performed. It is

very important for us to know what these actions are.

This statement indicated that he was more interested in the func-

310 OLD TEXTBOOKS

tioning of the bodily organs than in their structure. The titles
of the chapters further proved this. After introducing structure
in the first chapter, the titles of the remaining chapters were:
Food and Its Ingredients, Different Kinds of Food and Their
Preparation, Digestion, Absorption, Liver and Its Functions,
Blood, Respiration, Circulation, Animal Heat, Nutrition, Nervous
System, Spinal Nerves and Cord, Cranial Nerves, the Brain,
Sympathetic System, Special Senses, and Development. This edi-

tion went through numerous printings. Then in 1875 it was _re—*

copyrighted with no changes eXcept that a chapter on the
Anatomy of the Human Body was added, and the Glossary en-
larged. Each chapter was followed by a long list of questions. This
edition also appeared in several printings.

Joseph C. H ntchinson. Another popular physiology textbook of
this period was Hutchinson’s A Treatise on Physiology and
Hygiene (1870). Although he was a medical doctor, he claimed
to use “Familiar language . . . rather than that of a technical
character.” He like Dalton also emphasized the functions of
bodily organs. Although he
did not favor dissections or eX—
periments on animals in the
classroom, he did include a
chapter on the use of the
microscope in the study of
physiology. Meaningful ques-
tions were included at the bot-
tom of each page, and review
questions at the end of each
chapter. The appendix listed
the more common poisons and
their antidotes. The Glossary
not only defined the technical
words, but indicated their

Self Instruction in Phrenology and
Physiology, 1859.

PHYSIOLOGIES 311

pronunciation and root origin. This edition was recopyrighted in
1875, but no changes were made. In 1884 it was again recopy—
righted, but enlarged by 52 pages. Some of these additional pages
were devoted to such matters as drowning, care of a sick room,
disinfection, and emergencies. In all this Treatise appeared in
many printings for two decades.  

Hutchinson eventually sensed that the Treatise was too diﬂicult
for most public schools, so in 1884 he published The Laws of
Health. This was intended for the grammar grades. The plan of
this book was very similar to the Treatise, but contained 100
pages less content. Then in 1886 he wrote his First Lessons in
Physiology. This was intended for the elementary grades. Its
plan was also similar, but contained 60 pages fewer than The
Laws of Health. Thus Hutchinson’s texts constituted a graded
series of three books.

J. Dorman Steele. Next to Hutchinson’s physiologies those by
Steele apparently were the most widely used during this period.
In 1872 Steele published his Fourteen Weeks in Human Physi-
ology. Other texts by him in the Fourteen—VVeeks Series were in
natural philosophy (physics), chemistry, geology, and astronomy.
Like all of Steele’s textbooks,
his Human Physiology was
organized and Written to make
it very teachable. An analysis
of it reveals that it really was
a practical combination of
anatomy (structure), physiol-
ogy (function), and hygiene
(laws of health). It contained
many interesting and inform-
ing footnotes, practical ques-
tions, as Well as illustrations
and charts.

In 1884: he published his Hygienic Physiology, which was
more than 150 pages larger than his earlier one. The titles of the
chapters were the same in both, but the latter was more complete
and added a chapter on Health and Disease. Much more attention
was given to hygiene. In the Preface he stated:

To the description of each organ is appended an account of its most
common diseases, accidents, etc., and, when practicable, their mode
of treatment.

As a special feature it contained nearly 90 pages of Selected
Readings to illustrate and supplement the text. Like most texts
of the1880’s it listed antidotes to poisons, contained a glossary,
and dealt with alcoholic drinks and narcotics. This book con-
tinued to appear even after 1900.

R. T. Brown. He Was Professor of Physiology at the University
of Indiana. In 1872 Brown wrote the Elements of Physiology
and Hygiene in response to a resolution of the Indiana State
Teachers’ Association asking for such a text. It Was a book of
9286 pages, which were divided into ﬁfty lessons. A lesson was to
be covered each day. It was adapted to the “common division of
the school year into terms of about twelve Weeks each. If ﬁve
lessons are recited each week, the Work can be completed in a
term, and ten recitations left for review.”

Apparently to sell books beyond the conﬁnes of Indiana, in

1884 Brown wrote the Eclectic Physiology. It was published by 1

the same company that produced the McGuffey Eclectic Readers.
It was divided into seventeen chapters rather than lessons. The
book contained 179 pages of rather simply and clearly written
content. In 1887 Brown Wrote even a smaller and simpler book
entitled, The House I Live In. The content of this text consisted
rather largely of matters of hygiene. Some of the lesson titles
were: Good Kinds of Food and Drink, The Poison Appetite, How
To Make Muscles Strong, How We Should Take Exercise, How
To Bathe, and so on. It was endorsed by the VVoman’s Christian
Temperance Union for the primary grades, as was the Eclectic
for the more advanced grades.

Less popular physiologies. In addition to the above discussed

PHYSIOLOGIES 313

physiology textbooks several others appeared during the 1860-
1880 period, but which did not gain wide circulation. One was
Martindale’s H umcm Anatomy, Physiology, and H ygéene in 1872.
Although he held an M.D. degree, he was Principal of Madison

Grammar School in Philadelphia. Likely one reason Why this

text failed to gain popularity was because it was too similar to
several other physiology textbooks which already had wide adop-
tions. Too, it placed more emphasis on anatomy than Was true
of some of the more popular texts.

In 1889 a book entitled H ow To Get Strong and H ow To
Stay So by William Blaikie appeared. This was not a regular
physiology textbook, but it may be mentioned here because of its
marked attention to physical hygiene. The first half of the book
dealt with the background factors and matters regarding health
and strength, and then the second half with specific exercises for
given muscles and for different ages.

PH YSI OLOGI ES, 1 880-1 900

The physiology textbooks of this period were Written by a
greater number of authors than in the other two periods. The
Writer’s collection contains texts by 32 different authors. Certainly
one reason was because by the 1880’s physiology was taught in
more schools than earlier. This was particularly true on the ele-
mentary level. In fact many of the texts heretofore discussed in
this chapter were used chieﬂy in academies, and even in colleges.
Evidently the passage of laws in many states requiring the
teaching of the evil effects of alcohol and narcotics, due to agita-
tion by the W.C.T.U., virtually required the teaching of physi-
ology in all schools. Many of the physiology textbooks of this
period contained an endorsement of approval by the national
headquarters of the W.C.T.U.

While many different authors wrote texts during this period,
no one writer’s physiology gained very wide circulation. This was
not so true of the textbooks of any other field for this period.
However, a goodly number of the physiologies of this period were
published by one publishing company; namely, What is now the
American Book Company and its affiliates, such as A. S. Barnes

314 OLD TEXTBOOKS

& Company, and the Ivison, Blakeman & Company, and others.

A. B. C. physiologies. This company published several graded
series of physiologies during this period. One was known as the
Pathﬁnders Series. It consisted of No. 1——Child’s Health Primer
for primary classes; No. 2--Hygiene for Young People for
intermediate classes; and No. 8—Hygienic Physiology for ad-
vanced pupils. They were copyrighted in 1884:, and recopyrighted
in 1885 and 1888. They were Well illustrated, not only with pic-
tures of the structure of organs, but also with pictures illustrating
health and sanitation. They were not very technical. Hygiene
rather than anatomy was emphasized.

Another was the Eclectic Series. It consisted of The H onse I
Live In for primary schools; The Yonth’s Temperance M anual
for intermediate schools; and The Eclectic Physiology, or Guide
to Health (1884) for advanced classes. The name of Eli F.
Brown appeared on the title page of the earlier editions, but
omitted in the 1886 edition of the Guide to Health.

A series begun in 1884: was written by William T. Smith. It
consisted of the Primer of Physiology and Hygiene, and The
H nman Body and Its Health.

The so—called Authorized Physiology Series, also begun in 1884:,
consisted of No. I——Health for Little Folks; No. II-——Lessons
in Hygiene by Johonnet and Barton; and No. III—Anatomy,
Physiology, and Hygiene by Roger Tracy.

In 1897 the same company published the Frank Overton texts:
Applied Physiology, Intermediate Grade; and the Applied Physi-
ology, Advanced Grade. These books evidenced great improve-
ment over the other series in appearance, quality of pictures,
arrangement, and careful explanations. They continued in
circulation after the turn of the century.

If We add the texts written by Steele, heretofore discussed, it
can be seen that the American Book Company, successor to the
Antwerp, Bragg & Company, and their aﬁiliates, published six
series of physiologies during the last quarter of the nineteenth
century. The only popular physiologies during this period not
only‘ published by A. B. C. and affiliates were those by Blaisdell
published by Ginn & Company. A. B. C. in 1890 also took over

PHYSIOLOGIES 315

some textbook publishing rights from Harper’s and Appleton’s.,

Albert F. Blaisclell. In 1891 he began a series of three physi-
ologies. The first was The Child’s Book of Health. This was a
simple book with Very limited content. Each brief chapter was
followed with a rather long list of questions. It left the impression
that the content was Virtually to be committed. Soon thereafter
H ow to Keep Well appeared for the intermediate grades. This
book was followed in 1892 by Our Bodies and H ow We Live,
which was meant for the upper elementary grades. It was more
than three times the size of the Child’s Book. In 1897 A Practical
Physiology for secondary schools appeared. This was only a little
larger than Our Bodies. Then in 1902 he published his Life and
Health, which was meant for those secondary schools teaching
physiology only one semester. These books went through several
printings.

Less popular physiologies. In 1882 Charles K. Mills published
his First Lessons in Physiology and Hygiene. This was a book
of 250 pages, which appeared
to be more difficult and larger
than most beginning books.
He apparently meant it to be
for elementary schools using
only one physiology book. It
appeared in several printings.

Beginning in 1883 H.
Newell Martin, Professor of
Biology at Johns Hopkins,
Wrote a series of three texts
entitled The Human Body———

pages, Briefer Course of 364:

ture for health, Class Book of

pages, and Advanced Course of 655 pages. The beginner’s text
was larger and more technical than most other lowest level texts.
In contrast to other physiologies of that period, they contained
no glossary. These books appeared in at least three editions.

In 1891 the following two texts by Oliver P. Jenkins appeared:
Primary Lessons in Human Physiology, and Advanced Lessons
in Human Physiology. Although the latter title used the word,
advanced, it was meant for the upper elementary grades. These
books constituted the Indiana State Series. They were well il-
lustrated, but included no glossary. Both appeared in several
editions. S

CONCLUDING COMMENTS

Physiology was a late entry into the American common school
curriculum. When physiology textbooks did appear, most of
them were written by medical doctors. These men knew little
about teaching methods or the gradation of materials according
to the age of learners. Except for Horace Mann’s inﬂuence urging
the teaching of physiology in the common schools, apparently
little thought was given to teaching it at the lower levels. So
most of the earlier texts were meant to be used in academies and
colleges. For example, when the Yoakam Vocabulary Formula
was applied to Cutter’s popular Anatomy and Physiology (1846)
it was found that the vocabulary difficulty placement was at the
14.«th grade level, and that even Mrs. Cutter’sFirst Book on
Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene had an 11.’7th grade place-
ment.

Not only was physiology a late entry in the curriculum, the
authors were very slow in producing texts for this ﬁeld in graded
series. In most other subject ﬁelds graded series became common

.in the 1830’s and even earlier. The Cutters were the first to write

physiologies for different levels in the 1850’s. In fact, physiology
graded series did not become common until the 1880’s, when cer-
tain state laws required the evil effects of alcohol and narcotics
to be taught at all levels. S

Since so many of the texts were written by medical doctors,
who likely had been trained in medical schools, there was a tend-

PHYSIOLOGIES 317

ency for a considerable time to make the texts rather technical

in treatment, placing the emphasis on the structure of the bodily ‘

organs. Even the pictures in the books largely dealt with struc-
ture. More than 85 per cent of the pictures in the nineteenth
century books related to the alimentary, circulatory, muscular,
nervous, respiratory, and skeletal systems. After 1873 many
books contained some pictures in 'color, particularly showing the
circulatory and the muscular systems. Only one book contained
colored pictures before 1873; namely, Lambert’s text in 1851.
While the emphasis on the structural features gradually de-
creased, considerable attention to them continued until after 1900.

The ﬁrst texts to emphasize the functions and the hygiene of
the bodily organs were those by Dalton (1868), and Hutchinson
(1870). Thereafter most authors gave these features considerable
attention. Foods and their values received increasing attention,
as well as prevention and treatment of diseases. After 1900 even
public hygiene received attention. The treatment of matters re-
lating to personal hygiene increased from an average of 4: per
cent of the space in the texts before 1900 to 11 per cent in those
after 1900. The increase in matters of public hygiene was even
greater; namely, from an average of 1 per cent to 15 per cent.

Virtually no suggestions for pupil activities entered the texts
until after 1850. In the 62 texts before 1900 only 16 suggested
observing the characteristics of lower animals, 11 reciting about
the charts‘ and plates in the text, 25 reciting about the topical
outlines, and 26 answering the questions of the text. Three of
these four activities certainly were not very creative. The sug-
gested pupil activities most frequently mentioned in the nineteen
texts after 1900 were very different and more thought provoking
and creative. Nine suggested reporting on home experiences, 11
on community activities, 11 on habit forming activities, 8 study-
ing microscopic slides, 10 writing on suggested topics, and 11
working on construction work.

Another marked distinction between earlier textbooks and those
more recent was the absence of learning and teaching aids. The
ﬁve most commonly appearing aids in the 62 books before 1900
were tables of contents in 61, prefaces in 59, illustrations in 57,

notes in 52, and questions in 50. On the other hand, only 15 in--,

318 OLD TEXTBOOKS

cluded summaries, 22 suggestions for teachers, 28 tables or charts,
23 introductions, 25 appendices, 26 references, and 38 indexes.
Thus textbooks in physiology not only greatly improved in con-
tent after 1900 but even more so in their teachability.  

CHAPTER 10

PENMANSHIP, ART, AND MUSIC

SKILLS AND TASTE

IN the preceding chapters one entire chapter has been devoted
to each of the eight subjects most commonly taught in the
elementary schools of America before 1900. Since penmanship,
art, and music were usually not considered content subjects, and
since the latter two were not even commonly taught in the schools
before 1900, the three will be treated in the same chapter. All
three involve mainly the development of skills and taste.

PART I. PENMANSHIP

Of these three subjects, penmanship has been taught longest.
In fact, it was taught with reading in the earliest New England
Reading‘ and Writing Schools. However, pupils did not have a
textbook from which to learn to write; sometimes they had a
Copy—book. Copy-books were either like a bound and lined tablet
with covers, or merely a bound tablet with empty lines and printed
model script at the top of each page. In some instances the inside
page of the cover would contain instructions how to write well.
Many local printers throughout the United States very early
printed copy books for local sale. The Nietz Collection contains
many of these.

320 OLD TEXTBOOKS

As soon as teachers began to give handwriting careful and
analytical attention, there began to develop penmanship systems.
And handwriting manuals were prepared to guide teachers in
more effective penmanship instruction. Throughout the years
many Such manuals have appeared. Just how many handwriting
systems have been developed in the United States is difficult to
say. The purpose in this section is to deal with some of the writing
systems most popular before 1900.

PENMANSHIP SYSTEMS

The Jenkins’ System. Certainly one of the earliest systems was
developed by John Jenkins. The Collection has a copy of a hand-
writing manual by Jenkins entitled The Art of Writing, Book I,
published in 1813. The text consists of 68 rather large pages. In
addition 52 pages are devoted to a long preface and recommenda-
tions for use. It is an unusual book to have been written so
early in American textbook history. A page of dedication reads
as follows :

To Gentlemen and Ladies,
Instructors of Youth, and
to the Young Masters
and Misses Throughout the
United States, the following
New and Easy System of
Penmanship is Dedicated.

The Preface states that this
work or system had been used
by Jenkins since 1781 in ten
states of the Union. He be-
moans the poor methods of
his day, so “To remedy this
deﬁciency, he has, with much

PENMANSHIP, ART, AND MUSIC 321

study, indefatigable labor, and great expense of time and money,
composed the following System.” He had already published a
simpler and earlier manual in 1791. So the 1813 Manual repre-
sents his improved System.

Jenkins must have spent considerable time to gather the enor-
mous number of endorsements and recommendations included in
the book. By actual count it contained endorsements by 220
persons and recommendations by 109. Among these appeared
the names of such famous personages as John Adams, Elbridge
Gerry, Manasseh Cutter, Jonathan Edwards, Esq., Benjamin
Bush, George Clinton, Ben amin West, Robert Morris, and many
others of note. Among them also appeared the names of authors
of textbooks in other sub ect ﬁelds, Nicholas Pike, Noah Webster,
Chauncey Goodrich, Albert Picket, and Jedidiah Morse. The
presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Columbia also endorsed it.

A few words ought to be mentioned regarding some of the
comments contained in some of the recommendations. Several
mentioned that the other writing masters of that period were
Dean, VVrifford, Leonard, Farrar, Towne, and Mills. Dean was
mentioned as the author of an
Analytical Guide (to writ-
ing), and Wriﬁcord of a copy
book. However, several of
the recommenders stated that
all of these masters really
had taken their systems about
writing from Jenkins’ 1791
Manual.

Jenkins’ 1813 book was
plainly and interestingly writ-
ten. He began by presenting
the six principal strokes from
which all letters, in part or
whole, can be made. The
strokes were: 1. Direct, 2. in-

Art of Writing, Jenkins, 1813-
note systematic instructions.

322 OLD TEXTBOOKS

verted, 3. curved, 4. j, 5. 0, and 6. stem. Then he showed how
the different letters can be made from their use. He presented
a “Dialogue on Writing.” Other sections dealt with the posi-
tion for sitting to write, directions for holding the pen, exercise
of the pen, proportion of the letters, joining the letters, forma-
tion of capitals, and use of the pen both wet and dry. Near
the end of the book he presented exercises of sentences and verse
for writing. A page and a half was devoted to the making of
quill p.ens.iApparently steel pens had not yet been invented.
The directions throughout the book were very explicit. From the
foregoing it is evident that the first thorough system of hand-
writing was presented in Jenkins’ The Art of Writing in 1813.

Old Copy-books. The writer has a number of copy—books which
were said to have been used during the 1830’s and 1840’s. Some
have wood—cut pictures on the cover, which indicates their age. In
several of them the capitals and even some small letters were
strongly shaded. In all of them the letters were slanted.

Geo. J. Becker. On the back cover of Comly’s New Spelling Book
(1842), an entire page was given to an advertisement of Becker’s

Writing Books. The ad stated:

This Series. of Copy Books, consisting of Ten Numbers, recommends
itself . . . to the attainment of a clear and elegant style of writing;
by the beauty of the designs and the elegance of their execution.

These books were lined with model forms of writing at the top of
each page. This ad further stated that a work on Ornamental
Penmanship was in preparation. Becker was professor of Writing,
Drawing, and Bookkeeping in Girard College.

Page/son, Danton, and Scribner. After 1860 more writing manuals
appeared. One of these in 1862 was the Theory and Art of Pen-
manship by Payson, Dunton, and Scribner. This had 152 pages
of detailed analyses and instructions for better handwriting. In
Part I such matters as requisites, difference between script and
print, line and angles, positions and movements, elements and
principles, scale of lengths, analysis and combination of letters,

PENMANSHIP, ART, AND MUSIC 323

and drill and counting were discussed. Part II presented lessons
and exercises to execute the above matters. Drill was given con-
siderable attention. These authors also published the National
Series of Copy Books, which consisted of a School Series, Business
Series, Ladies’ Series, Primary Tracing Books, Primary Short
Course, and the Pencil Series.

S. A. Potter. In 1866 appeared his Penmanship Explained; or
the Principles of Writing Reduced to an Exact Science. It really
was a teacher’s manual explaining the use of copy~bool<s by
Potter and Hammond. In “Hints to Teachers” Potter condemned
the use of quill pens, and suggested that the teachers “procure
a uniform and suitable pen for the whole class.” In discussing the
movements while writing, he analyzed the movement of the ﬁnger,
the forearm, and the whole arm. The ﬁnger movement “gives nice
touches of beauty,” “the fore-arm gives freedom to the style,”
and the whole arm accomplishes “such strokes with the pen as a
skilful painter might make
with a brush in tracing a bold
sketch.” He added that the
“combination of the ﬁnger
with the fore—arm and whole-
arm movement is adapted to
any sized handwriting.”

In the latter part of the
book nineteen pages are de-
voted to explaining Potter and
Hammond’s S ynthetical, Ana-
lytical, and Progrlessive Sys~
tem of Business Penman-
ship for Public and Private
Schools. These copy—books

appeared in three series:

Theory and Art of Penmanship,
1862.

324 OLD TEXTBOOKS

1. The School Series-——Nos. 1 to 9 inclusive.
2. The Ladies’ Series——Nos. 10 to 12 inclusive.
3. The Mercantile and Ornamental Series—Nos. 13 to 15 inclusive.

The authors also published corresponding Charts.

Other Series of Copy—B0oks in the 1870’s. In the back of Apple-
ton’s Third Reader of 1877 one publishing company advertised
the sale of six different systems of copy—books. 1. Appleton’s
Standard C0py—B00ks by Lyman D. Smith, four series. a 2.
Barnes’s National System of Penmanship, three series. 3. The
above mentioned series by Payson, Dunton, Scribner. 4. The
Eclectic C0py—B0cks, three series. 5. The Harper’s N ew Graded
C'0py—B00ks by H. W. Shaylor, three series. 6. Spencerian Pen-
manship, four series. The prices of these various copy—books were
listed. Most of these books sold for "72, '75, or 9-6 cents per dozen.

S pencerian System. The writing system that became most popular
during the latter part of the nineteenth century was the S pence-
rian System of Penmanship beginning in 1873. The outside cover
of these copy—books contained the names of ﬁve Spencers and
three others as authors. These books were 81/2 inches wide and 7
inches high. The inside of both the front and back covers plus
the outside of the back cover
contained detailed explanation
in fine print of the Spencer
system. Seven basic principles
were listed, as follows: The
ﬁrst principle was a straight
line on the main slant of 52° ;
the second was a right curve
usually on a connective slant
of 30°; the third was a left
curve, usually on the connec-
tive slant; the fourth Was a
loop upon the main slant; the

PENMANSHIP, ART, AND MUSIC 325

ﬁfth was a direct oval or capital 0; the sixth was a reversed oval
upon the main slant; and the seventh was the capital stem. At
the top of each page appeared either words or sentences printed
in model script. Below this was a heavy red separating line.
Parallel blue lines were for the student’s writing.

In 1874 a teacher’s manual appeared explaining more fully,
together with some pictures, the system, which was entitled
Theory of S pencerian Penmanship. It was a sort of catechism of
questions and answers concerning the system. The slant in the
Spencerian system was more marked than most earlier systems.
Shading was given considerable attention.

Eclectic System. Also in 1873 L. S. Thompson, 0. H. Bowler, and
N. E. D. Bowler published the Eclectic System of Penmanship.
Like the Spencerian copy~books, their system was explained and
illustrated on the back of the front cover and on the inside -of the
back cover. It used only blue lines and was not as attractive as
the Spencerian Copy-Books. The slant was as marked as the
Spencerian, and shading was emphasized. The back of the back
cover advertised the nine copy-books of the series, the writing-
cards, an exercise book, a key,
and even Eclectic Pens. It
claimed to be the “most easily

lished.”

Vertical Script. Until about
187 5, nearly universally, all
writing systems used the slant,
many were 88° from the verti-
cal. At about that time certain
French and German medical
men discovered numerous cases
of spinal curvature and eye
trouble among children. They

Theory of Spencerian Penman-
ship, 1874. T

326 OLD TEXTBOOKS

blamed the slanted writing systems for these troubles. For example,
many who followed the Spencerian system directed the children
to sit with the right side toward the desk, the right elbow resting
on it, and the left arm hanging from the shoulder, except that
the hand rested on the paper. This meant that the right shoulder
would be raised higher than the left and the head inclined to the
left. This could cause a lateral curvature of the spine in the back
and neck. Too, the left eye would be farther from the writing
than the right. Unequal accommodation and eye strain could
result.

In 1879 the Society of Public Medicine of France recommended
certain remedies: (1) The shoulders should parallel the desk
while writing; (2) the right elbow should not rest on the desk;
(3) the paper should be held with the left hand; and (41) the
Vertical form of writing should be adopted. Later it was also
argued that vertical writing was more legible than the slant. On
the other hand, those that favored the slant argued that it could
be done with greater ease and rapidity. As a consequence of these

arguments conﬂicting systems of writing soon appeared. Also

considerable experimentation resulted.

In 1898 Potter and Putnam published The N ew Vertical Script
Primer. .The earliest lessons were printed in vertical script.
Further in the book the lessons were alternately printed script
and Roman print. The purpose was to present written letters
vertically as were the printed letters. At the turn of the century
many schools taught the Vertical script.

The Palmer Method. Although in the analysis of textbooks in
other sub ect ﬁelds the terminal date has been roughly 1900, here
for evident reasons limited treatment will be given past that date.
During the confusion concerning the best system of Writing A. N.
Palmer in 1901 published The Palmer Method of Business Writ-
ing. This manual had the shape of a copy—book 9 inches wide and
nearly 6 inches high, but contained no pages for copy practice.
Rather it was a manual of 96 pages, consisting of 14.46 lessons

328 OLD TEXTBOOKS

with writing instructions. On the title page appeared the following
statement:

A Series of Self-teaching Lessons in Rapid, Plain, Unshaded, Coarse-
pen, Muscular Movement Writing for Use in All Schools, Public or
Private, Where an Easy and Legible Handwriting is the Object
Sought; Also for the Home Learner.

In the Preface Palmer claimed that his system had “nothing
in common with copy—books which have been so largely used in
public schools for more than half a century.” If they were right,
his book was wrong. His aim was not to develop one’s skill as a
pen artist, but good practical legible writing ability. He op-
posed fancy shaded writings. He further claimed that the use
of copy-books killed individuality and made freedom of movement
impossible. His lessons should result in a “handwriting that em-
bodies these four essentials——legibility, rapidity, ease, and en-
durance.” His manual appeared for several decades in many
editions after 1901. Palmer was also the editor of the American
Penman.

More Recent Handwriting Systems. Apparently the confusion
regarding the merits of the best system of handwriting continued
long after 1900. Many city and state school systems had developed
their own handwriting manuals to be followed. In addition many
authors and commercial publishing houses continued to produce
manuals for particular handwriting systems. It may be in order
to mention some of them. In 191% The H ealey System of Freearm
M ovement Writing appeared. Then in 1914: Zaner published the
Short Cut to Plain Writing. Since then the Zaner—Bloser Company
has published a number of handwriting manuals, including several
co—authored by Frank N. Freeman. The H ausam System of Plain
Penmanship was published in 1923. In 1927 Ellen C. Nystrom
produced the Self—Correcti*ce Handwriting Charts. F. O. Putnam
wrote Helpful Suggestions for Teaching the Practical Hand-
writing Course in 1935. Also in 1935 H. M. Hill published the
Handwriting Made Easy manual. The next year John G. Kirk
and F. N. Freeman published a manual on Functional Hand-
writing. The New Laurel Handwriting by Almack, Billington,

PENMANSHIP, ART, AND MUSIC 329
Staflelbach, and Powers was published in 1937. The same year

Lucretia Cavanah and Alonzo Myers wrote a manual for H and-
writing for Expression. In 1938 The Rice System of Business
Penmanship appeared. Max Rosenhaus later published several
manuals (1938, 1953, 1959). J. A. Savage published a manual
for Manuscript Writing—--Print I/Vriting—-Made Easy in 1938.
In 1954 Dorothy Emerson published the Help Yourself to Better
Handwriting.

Several handwriting manuals of a special nature were also

published. In 1999 Alonzo Myers and Nellie Slye wrote a manual i

on Remedial Handwriting. In 1938, Luella Cole published the
Cole Diagnostic Exercises in Handwriting and in 1939 wrote an
article on “Instruction in Penmanship for the Left—Handed
Child.” Then Warren Gardner wrote the Left Handed Writing
Instruction manual in 1945, and Mildred Plunkett her Writing
Manual for Teaching the Left—handed in 19544. It can be seen
that eventually writing exercises were developed to meet special
needs.

In the meantime, surveys, experiments, and studies relating to
handwriting have been made. Commonly Thorndike’s Hand-
writing Scale (1910) or Ayres Scale was used to measure the
quality of handwriting. Freeman worked on developing acceptable
standards for both quality and speed. Generally the slant was
ignored in measuring quality. In other words the slant has not
been standardized. In the Third Yearbook (1925) of the Depart-
ment of Superintendence a minimum standard of 50 in quality
on the Agres Scale and a speed of 70 letters per minute was
recommended.

PART II. ART

Attempts to ﬁnd expression and communication in visual art
were made even by the primitives. So art is as old as mankind,
and has been practiced by nearly all peoples throughout history.
However, its purposes and forms have diflered greatly among the
diﬁcerent peoples and times. Among the ancients, the Greeks
developed it more highly than any other peoples. Since then the
part played by the quality of expressions in art has varied con-

siderably. The purpose here, however, is not to present a history
of art, but rather to present the evolution of the use of manuals
or textbooks of art in American schools.

The sources of information regarding the beginnings of the
teaching of art in American schools seem to be limited. It appears
evident that the teaching of art was emphasized in certain schools
in the continental countries of Europe before it received much
attention in England and the United States. Much of the empha-
sis in the early teaching of art was on its relation to industry and
commerce. Tradesmen were often taught to draw in relation to
their work. Hence it was natural that its appearance both in
English and American schools would be in industrial centers.
Much of England’s pioneer work in teaching art related to draw-
ing and design. Exhibitions at the London World’s Fair in 1851
revealed clearly how art and science applied to trade and industry.
Both Englishmen and Americans were stimulated by these ex-

hibits. Parliament soon took several actions to further the teaching '

of art in England.

In the United States no concerted action toward the teaching
of art was taken very early. However, certain schools and cities
did attempt to introduce art. Most of the earliest schools to do so
were not regular public schools. For example, in Philadelphia
three special schools rather early began to teach certain aspects
of art. In 180-6 the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts introduced
instruction in drawing and clay modelling. Beginning in 1824
the Franklin Institute began to teach several types of drawing.
In 1847 a School of Design was opened for women. Soon similar
special schools for teaching different forms of art were opened in
other cities, New York, Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, and Pitts-
burgh.

The first introduction of art in a public school likely was when
in 1812 William Fowle, headmaster of a Boston public school,
required its study. Soon thereafter he translated for use a French
book of drawing geometric figures. In 1827 art was made optional
in the English High School in Boston. However, no special
teacher of art was appointed in Boston until 1853. Even earlier,
Philadelphia appointed a leading artist, Rembrandt Peale, to

PENMANSHIP, ART, AND MUSIC 331

supervise graphic art in the public schools in 1842. The Nietz
Collection has a pamphlet, apparently written by Peale entitled
“Graphics, The Art of Accurate Delineation, A Department of
School Exercise, For the Education of the Eye, and‘ the Training
of the Hand, as Auxiliary to Writing, Geography, Geometry
and Drawing.” The pamphlet contains a lengthy testimonial enu-
merating seven values of the teaching of graphics signed by ten
principals and teachers in the Philadelphia schools. It further
quotes Pestalozzi and Horace Mann as favoring the teaching of
art in the schools. Pestalozzi said, “The art of writing, to be
taught consistently with nature, ought to be treated as subordinate
to that of drawing. . . . Writing itself is a sort of linear draw-
ing.” So he suggested that drawing be taught before writing.
Later agitation in Boston led the legislature of Massachusetts
in 1860 to permit drawing to be listed as an optional school
subject. In 1864 Boston made it a required subject in the upper
grades, and in 1868, in all grades and in the normal school. Then
in 1870 the l\Iassachusetts legislature enacted a law which read
in part:
Sec. 1. . . . to include Drawing among the branches of learning
which are by said section required to be taught in the public schools.
Sec. 2. Any city or town may, and every city and town having more
than 10,000 inhabitants shall, annually make provision for giving

free instruction in industrial and mechanical drawing to persons over
ﬁfteen years of age, either in day or evening schools.

In the same year Walter Smith, a headmaster of an art school in
England, was brought here to become the State Director of Art
in Massachusetts, and to teach art in the Boston Normal School.
He remained here thirteen years.

The Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 further
quickened interest among educators through its art exhibits, many
of which had been sent here from European countries. Between
1870 and 1907 drawing was made a required subject by twelve
state legislatures. Many cities and town school systems in thirty-
one other states required it. Many cities published their own
courses of study in art. In some cities it was taught only in the
upper grades and high school.

ART MANUALS AND TEXTBOOKS

Some of the earliest textbooks in what may be termed as art,
in a sense at least, were books dealing with certain specialized
aspects of art. This likely was true because art was mostly taught
at first in specialized schools rather than in general public schools.
Hence books appeared dealing with graphics, geometrical ﬁgures,
perspective, and so on. The lack of including the teaching of art
in regular academic schools, until rather recently, certainly did
not reﬂect the place of art among nearly all peoples of all ages.
In other words, formal academic curriculums have not always
reﬂected the interests and appreciations of peoples.

Lambert’s H cmd—boolc. One of these early specialized books was
Miss Lambert’s H a/nd—book of Needlework published in 1842. The
book contained twenty-two chapters dealing with the different
types of needlework. Of course, it dealt with the development of
skills involved in the use of the needle in these types of work, yet
also much emphasis was given to producing artful needlework.
Certain chapters dealt with tapestry, braid, embroidery, canvas
work, crochet, knitting, netting, and bead work. The book was
attractively printed and contained numerous pictures and designs.

One very interesting feature of the book was that each chapter
opened with one or more poetic quotations referring to the use of
the needle, usually as an instrument of art. Many of these quo-
tations were written by John Taylor, the water poet. In the 1600’s
he wrote a book entitled The Needle’s Ea:cellency—A Bookie
wherein are diuers Admirable Workes Wrought with the Needle.
One extract read:

Thus is a needle prov’d an instrument Of proﬁt, pleasure, and of
ornament, Which mighty queenes have grac’d in hand to take.

Miss Lambert’s H am-d—book ends with a long poem by Taylor. It
referred to the needle both as an instrument of utility and of art
or ornament. Certain extracts follow:

A Needle (though it be but small and slender)

PENMANSHIP, ART, AND MUSIC 333

Yet it is both a maker and mender:

And thus without the needle we may see

We should without our Bibs and Biggins bee;

No shirts or Smockes, our nakedness to hide,

No garments gay, to make us magniﬁde:

No shadowes, Shapparoones, Caules, Bands, Ruﬁs, Kuffs,

l\To.Ta.ble.—cloathes., for Parlours or for P.Ialls,

Nor any Garment man or woman weares.

That as their Daughters Daughters up did grow,
The Needle’s Art, they to their children show.

George Childs. One of the earliest drawing books for use in
regular schools was Childs’ Drawing Book of Objects: Studies

Childs’ Drawing Book of Objects, 1846, one of the earliest used in
schools.

334 OLD TEXTBOOKS

from Still Life. The writer’s copy is a third edition published in
18426. Childs was born in Baltimore in 1829 and when fourteen
moved to Philadelphia. There he soon became a clerk in a book-
store. After four years he opened a store of his own. In due time,
he became a publisher of books. In 1864: he became the owner of
the Philadelphia Public Ledger. He later contributed liberally to
benevolent causes.

This book contained 23 pages 101/2 inches wide and 7 inches
high each with pictures of twelve rather common objects. Thus it
contained 276 pictures of objects as models for drawing, and also
apparently for coloring; for many pictures in the writer’s copy
have been colored. The first page had pictures of a key, scissors,
cap, teapot, compass, spoon, kettle, etc. The title page stated the
book to be “for young pupils and drawing classes in schools.” No
directions or instructions were given for drawing. The book con-
tained only the pictures of ob ects.

J. G. Chapman. One of the first, if not the ﬁrst, real drawing
manual to include instructions was The American Drawing—Bo0k
by Chapman in 1847. The title page stated it to be “A manual
for the Amateur, and basis of study for the professional artist:
especially adapted to the use of public and private schools, as well
as home instruction.” It consisted of 168 large pages 12 inches
high and 9 inches wide. It con-
tained 12 testimonials from
“gentlemen distinguished in
the Fine Arts, Literature, and
the promotion of Education.”
One was written by Samuel F.
B. l\Iorse.

The Introduction began by
saying, “Anyone who can
learn to write can learn to
draw and, as writing is not

ment.

taught to those only who are destined to become authors, .
so is drawing equally important to others besides professional
artists.” He then presented careful instruction for the develop-

ment of drawing skills: first, only straight lines, then simple A

designs made by straight lines, and next rather complicated de-
signs of straight lines. On page 19 exercises began involving
curved lines, resulting in the construction of artistic designs.
Chapter II dealt with rudiments of drawing the human head.
The chapter ended with a drawn head of George Washington
in curved lines. Then Chapter III dealt with the rudiments of
drawing the human ﬁgure. Other chapters dealt with the ele-
ments of geometry, perspective, and the “art of writing in con-
nexion with drawing.” One gets the impression that this manual
was more to develop technical skills in drawing rather than to
develop an appreciation of art. Nevertheless it was a pioneer
school drawing text. A

M ago and Sheldon. In 1863 E. A. Sheldon published a 407 page
book entitled Lessons on Objects. This was a revised and re-
arranged edition of a book which was first written in England
by Elizabeth Mayo, a Pestalozzian devotee, in 1831. Actually it
was mostly a methods and nature study book, but it contained
certain elements that were related to art. In fact, the ﬁrst chapter
was entitled, “Hints on Sketch VVriting.” This book helped
spread the so—called Oswego Movement in American education.
The development of drawing as a school subject became closely
related to that movement, for many drawing books soon appeared
on the market.

W. N. Bartholomew. One of the first graded series in drawing was
written by Bartholomew in the late 1860’s. This series contained
four books, accompanied by a Tedche7"s Guide for each. The
Guide to Drawing, Book N o. .4 appeared in 1870. In the Intro-
ductory Remarks Bartholomew criticized learning to draw by
copying pictures. Thus the drawing produced, he said, became
an end, not a means to an end. He held drawing to be a language,
and thus to be learned, step, by step. “The eye should first be
disciplined to see, the mind to recognize, and the hand to draw,

lines of any length, in any required position, and bearing any
given relation to each other.” This was only the first step.  

Each Guide containedspeciﬁc directions for teaching twelve
lessons. These lessons were rather long and detailed. Evidently
more than one day would be devoted to a lesson. He recommended
that the teacher always should use the blackboard. Each move-
ment or step should be illustrated and thoroughly directed and
explained. These books appeared in several editions.

S. F. Bnckelew and C. A. H alstead. In 1878 the Misses Buckelew
and Halstead published the Dictation Lessons in Drawing for use
in the primary grades to accompany VVhite’s Primary School
Drawing Cards. This is a manual of 992 pages giving detailed
directions for teaching drawing in six grades. The numbering of
the grades was in reverse order; namely, the beginning Work was
to be given in the Sixth Grade (actually First Grade), and the
most advanced work in the latter part of the book in the First

PENMANSHIP, ART, AND MUSIC 337

Grade (Sixth Grade). Such reverse numbering of grades was
common in some European schools. The first nine pages were
devoted to general directions and deﬁnitions of the different kinds
of lines, rectilinear ﬁgures, and curvilinear figures.

The steps suggested were ﬁrst, draw the guide lines; second,
sketch the design very lightly; and third, erase all mistakes and
untidy marks. Reproduced plates of twenty—four of White’s
Industrial Drawing Cards appeared with the directions for the
various lessons or exercises in the book. Although some of the
plates represent such concrete objects as houses and barns, they
are shown only in two dimensional form. Nevertheless, this book
appeared in several editions.

The Prcmg Art Textbooks. In 1886 the Prang Educational
Company published The Use of Models by Mary D. Hicks and
John S. Clark. Evidently Prang engaged these writers to pre-
pare it. Its sub—title was “A Teacher’s Assistant in the use of the
Prang Models for Form Study and Drawing in Primary Schools.”
They claimed this to be the first work of its kind. Its claim was
based on “a course of exercises in Form Study and Drawing which
has in view mental development through the combined use of the
hand and the eye.” It was true that most previous art books aimed
largely at the development of skills only, but this system aimed
at mental development as well.
Very early in the book the ex-
ercises involved three dimen-
sional drawing. It contained
183 attractive pages of direc-
tions, exercises, and picture
models. In the back, 144 pages
were devoted to listing and
describing Prang’s art ma-
terials available for school use.
The 1887 edition of this
manual already listed 64 cities
using the Prang Method.

Prang, The Use of Models, 1887.

338 OLD TEXTBOOKS

In 1888 the Teacher’s Manual for Prang’s Shorter Course in
Form Study and Drawing was published. It was prepared by the
above two authors and Walter S. Perry. This Manual presented
“not Form Study alone, not Drawing alone, but Form Study and
Drawing as complementing each other.” Its work and exercises
were presented in Books I, II, III, IV, and V. The exercises in-
volved a wide range of objects and interesting subjects, ending
in an introduction to manual training.

In 1893 The Prang Primary Course in Art Education by Mary
D. Hicks and Josephine C. Locke was published. It represented a
further development of the previous two manuals. It added to the
use of Form Study and Drawing the use of Color. Lessons for
thirty—six weeks of work were concretely presented for each year.
Even a casual examination of these books will impress one that
the Prang art manuals were the best to appear up to that time.

Jacobs and Brower. In 1887 a Hand—Book to Accompany the
Graphic System of Object Drawing by Hobart B. Jacobs and
Augusta L. Brower was published. This was a rather small and
unattractive book of 59 pages. It included only two pictures. It
primarily aimed only to help the student to develop skills in
graphic drawing. It evidently failed to gain wide usage.

Art Books after 1900. Although the primary purpose of this
book has been to discuss only those old textbooks that were
published before 1900, yet in several chapters brief treatment has
been given to certain textbook developments after that date. So
only a few art books after 1900 will be mentioned.

Among the ﬁrst art books to appear after 1900 were the Text
Books of Art Education published by the Prang Company. Book
V was written in 1904 by Hugo B. Froehlich and Bonnie E.
Snow. Mention was made that these books were planned in a series
of conferences and consultations with leading educators and
teachers of art, so they would reﬂect not only the latest ideas
about art education, but also that the educational principles in-
volved would accord with the latest acceptedpsychological laws
of child development. The lessons in the books were divided into
three groups to be known as The “Observational or Objective

PENMANSHIP, ART, AND MUSIC 339

Group, in which the study of things is the aim; the Subjective
Group, in which the study of principles or laws of beauty is the
aim; and the Creative Group, in which the application of ac-
cumulative knowledge and ability is the aim.” In the primary
grades the work was largely ob ective. In the intermediate grades
the children were introduced to principles involving balance,
rhythm, and harmony. Book V explained the subjective and
creative aspects. The first topic was “Selecting a Picture,” such
as views from a car window, from a window at home, and so on.
Many of the model pictures in this book were in beautiful colors.
These Books show great developmental progress in the teaching
of art since Child’s Drawing Book of the I84.<0’S.

In 1809 Fred H. Daniels published the School Drawing, A
Real Correlation. It contained example pictures relating to his-
tory, literature, geography, animal life, the seasons, and city and
country life, accompanied by explanations and descriptions of
the pictures. Certainly it could have been of no more value than
as a supplementary drawing book.

In 1999 Bridgman’s Handbook of Drawing appeared. He was
both the author and publisher of this and other books and ma-
terials related to art. He also published art books and materials
written by other authors. The particular purpose of his Hand-
book was to make drawing appeal to children. This was in har-
mony with the growing Dewey philosophy of Progressive Edu-
cation. He further mentioned that the “way to interest a child
in anything is by telling a story, drawing therefore is only a
medium employed. The first thing to do is to create interest.”
The Handbook then consisted of 62 pages of curiously interesting
pictures with comments explaining their meanings and suggested
drawing activities. In the back of the book a long list of Bridgman
art educational books were advertised for sale. I

CONCLUDING COMMENTS

From the foregoing‘ presentation it can be seen that art had
great difficulty in gaining admission to the common school our-
riculum. It was taught in specialized schools long before it was
admitted to public schools. Thus most of the earliest books dealing

340 OLD TEXTBOOKS

with art were of a specialized or technical nature; for example,
books dealing with graphics, perspective, and needlework.

Eventually when art textbooks for public schools began to ap-
pear, they were very different from the art books of today. One
of the first was by Childs, and consisted merely of pictures to be
copied or drawn. Chapman’s manual was one of the first to include
instructions for drawing. In the 1860’s Bartholomew developed a
graded series of drawing books. However, they dealt only with
two dimensional drawing. In the late 1880’s the Prang Company
employed a number of art teachers to help develop a more ad-
vanced system of art teaching, which aimed at the development
of the mind as Well as of skills. The later Prang manuals included
the use of color and original child activities. In 1926 Bridgman
based his system considerably on the interests of children. Thus
there was a gradual and progressive development in the teaching
of art which is reﬂected in the textbooks dealing with art.

PART III. MUSIC

Music in some form or other is about as old as mankind. Even
the primitives made much of music; sometimes they would sing
when they worked. Since primitive times music has gone through
numerous developmental changes. It is, however, beyond the scope
of this chapter to give an extensive history of music.

In general, the earliest most extensive use of music was related
to religious exercises or worship. The primitives used both vocal
and crude instrumental music in connection with religious rites.
Often these rites would also contain some tribal and patriotic
signiﬁcance. With the development of civilization the forms and
instruments of music changed, but the purposes largely continued
to be either religious or national or a combination of both. In the
Western World both Catholics and Protestants have made wide
use of music in churches. Likewise, with the development of
nationalism, music has been used for patriotic, military, and
political purposes.

Early New England settlers brought psalm singing with them.
The Bay Psalm Book (1640) became one of America’s earliest
printed books. Later, when hymn writers, such as Charles Weslay

PENMANSHIP, ART, AND MUSIC 341

and Isaac Watts, multiplied the availability of good hymns, an
even wider use of music in churches became common. But how and
Where would the people learn to follow the tunes properly? In
many European churches choir boys would be taught how to sing.
But in early American churches this was not so common. Hence
the development of good church music was slow here.

One development in America helped to remedy this weakness.
Beginning about 1720 singing—schools sprang up. Two early
music instruction books made their appearance for use in such
schools. One was by Reverend John Tufts in 1721, and another
by Reverend Thomas Walter also in 1721. The latter book was
one of the first to contain printed music. These books thus pro-
vided the tool for teaching music. As a consequence, singing-
schools soon spread throughout the colonies. At first apparently
mainly only religious songs were taught, but later these schools
served wider purposes, such as social and patriotic.

Other music books soon made their appearance. Among them
were some using a very different musical notation. One type used
shaped or buckwheat notes. This type was presented in The Easy
Instructor by William Little and William Smith, written in 1798
and later appearing in many editions. The notes were shaped in
triangles, squares, rounds, and diamonds, representing the musical
syllables of fa, sol, la, and mi. A number of song books using these
notes appeared during the nineteenth century. However, by the
time music was introduced in the public schools, the European
type of musical notation became common. Nevertheless singing-
schools using the two types of musical notation continued for
some time. The singing—school was nearly the sole means of musi-
cal instruction in a popular sense until music began to be taught

, in the public schools.

BEGINNINGS OF PUBLIC’ SCHOOL MUSIC

The introduction of music in the public schools was largely due
to the eﬁ'orts of Lowell Mason (1792-1872), who has often been
called the “father of public school music in the United States.”
He was born and reared in Massachusetts, taught district schools
there, taught music and conducted choirs and singing societies in

342 OLD TEXTBOOKS

Georgia, returned north to help organize the Boston Academy of
Music, and went to Switzerland to study Pestalozzianism and
Swiss and German schoolbooks containing music and songs.

On his return he directed his efforts to expanding the oppor-
tunities for learning music. After failing at first to induce Boston
to include music in the public schools, he organized classes for
children on Wediiesday and Saturday afternoons. Hundreds at—
tended these classes, resulting in the presentation of juvenile
concerts. In the meantime he also wrotethe Juvenile Psalmist,
(1899), a music book for Sunday schools, and later the American
Tune Book for choirs and singing societies. In 1834: he Wrote
Mason’s Manual of Instruction, the first formulation of modern
principles of teaching music in the United States.

In 1837 Boston adopted a resolution “to try the experiment of
introducing vocal music, . . . in the public schools of the city.”
Music was introduced at first only in the Hawes School. Its
success led the School Committee to contract a teacher of vocal
music for all the schools in 1838. This action has been referred
to as “The Magna Charta of musical education in this country.”
Mason was placed in full charge of the music in the Boston schools,
including the music training program in the normal school.

Although a few individual schools, where the principal favored
the teaching of music, had introduced music before 1888, the real
spread of teaching music in public schools came after that date.
Soon some other cities followed Boston in teaching music in their
schools: Buffalo, 1843; Pittsburgh, 1844:; Cincinnati, 1845;
Chicago, 1848; Cleveland, 1851; San Francisco, 1851; and St.
Louis, 1852. The U.S. Commissioner of Education, John Eaton,
reported in 1886 that less than 250 school systems were regularly
teaching music. Thus the spread of teaching music was not uni-
versal, especially not in the rural schools, but its popularity was
increasing.

THE AIMS AND CONTENT OF MUSIC BOOKS

In 1954 Walter J ones1 made an analysis of 96 public school

1Walter R. Jones, “An Analysis of Public School Music Textbooks Before
1900.” (Unpublished doctor’s dissertation, University of Pittsburgh, 1954.)

PENMANSHIP, ART, AND MUSIC 343

music books published in the United States before 1900. The data
presented in this section are largely based on his ﬁndings.

Music Aims. The three most frequently mentioned aims for teach——

ing music were to teach the rudiments of music, serve religious’

purposes, and provide pleasure. The ﬁrst aim was mentioned in
58 books, the second in 38, and the third in 29. The percentage
of books mentioning the development of music skills in the differ-
ent decades remained rather constant, but those mentioning re-
ligion declined after 1870. Other aims were less frequently
mentioned.

Content of Music Teactbooks. Since the books varied greatly both
in regard to the size of the pages as Well as in the number of
pages, it was thought best to determine the content of them in
terms of the number of songs dealing with the different content
themes. So the number of songs were counted in each book, and
then the percentage relating to the different themes determined.
The ﬁndings by decades are presented in Table IX.

It can be seen that although the religious aim was not mentioned
in the prefaces very often after 1870, yet the percentage of re-
ligious songs was still very high in the 1880’s, but dropped in
the 1890’s. When the religious and moral songs were added to-
gether for the entire period, nearly one—third of all songs were
of this nature. The next highest frequency, one—fourth of the
songs, dealt with such things of nature as birds, animals, trees,
and so on. When the songs related to the seasons are added to
those of nature, they represent more than one—third. Of the other
themes, only the patriotic songs represented as much as seven
per cent. Nevertheless, it can be seen that the themes of the songs
dealt with many thoughts and sentiments.

MUSIC’ TEXTBOOKS

The Nietz Collection contains many very old song books, ﬁve
with buckwheat notes, including a copy of The Easy Instructor
by Little and Smith, which began that system. Most of these
apparently were not intended for public school use. Some were
plainly hymn books with no notes included, and others with notes
intended for use in singing—schools as well as churches. So it is
very difficult to say which one was ﬁrst used in the common schools.
Probably the safest approach on this matter is to depend upon
the statements in the books themselves regarding their intended
use.

Augustus Peabody. The Child’s Song Book for “the use of Schools
and Families” edited and compiled by Peabody was published in
Boston in 1830. In the preface it was stated that the “leading
object in compiling this little book has been to aid Teachers of
Infant Schools.” The songs were mostly in one—part music. The
songs were such as to appeal to children. Just how widely this book
was used is now uncertain, since the teachng of music in public
schools had not started.

Lowell Mason. The second school music textbook was written by
Lowell Mason, who previously had written music books for re-
ligious use. This one was the Juvenile Lyre, which was submitted

346 OLD TEXTBOOKS

Chz'ld’s Song Book, ﬁrst music book published in U.S. for juvenile use.

PENMANSHIP, ART, AND MUSIC 347

for copyright in 1831, but published in 1832. It was intended for
“use in primary and common schools.” A third music textbook,
The Juvenile Singing School, was also written by Mason. It was
published in 1839, which was one year after Boston introduced
music in the public schools. Evidently this book was intended for
Boston use.

Later Mason wrote numerous other music textbooks. Among
them were: Boston School Song Book (1843) ; Song—Book of the
School——Room (1847) ; The Singing School (185%) ; and the N or-
mal Singer (1856). Several of these books continued to be re-
published even after his death. E. Ives assisted in writing the
Juvenile Lyre, and G. J. Webb the Song—Book of the School-
Room. The later books included mostly songs in four parts.

Mason held that the three chief reasons for teaching music
were (1) to promote devotional feeling; (Q) to promote health;
and (3) to improve the heart. He always believed that many more
can learn to sing than do. From all the foregoing data it is clearly
evident that Mason exerted greater inﬂuence on the beginnings
and later development of the teaching of music in the public
schools than any other author.

Asa Fitz. In the early 184.«O’s Fitz wrote The American School
Song Book. It opened with seven pages of ﬁne print dealing with
the elements of music. Most of the songs were in two part music.
Since it was for young children, it omitted the bass notes. It was
bound with limp paper covers.

William B. Bradbury. After Lowell Mason the next early im-
portant writer of music textbooks was Bradbury. In 1842 he with
Charles W. Sanders wrote The Young Choir. Then in 1852 he
alone wrote Musical Gems for School and Home. The first 3'7
pages dealt in detail with the elements of music. Thus the book
was more technical than some of the other music textbooks then
extant. Songs in two part, three part, and four part music were
included. The last 22 pages presented a selection of metrical tunes
and other sacred pieces. It was intended to be “a complete musical
manual for teachers and students.” He also wrote The Keg/—Note

(1863) for churches and singing—schools, and The Victory for
miscellaneous purposes.

I. B. Woodbury. In 1847 Woodbury published the Youth’s Song
Book. This book was for “schools, classes, and the social circle.”
It devoted eight pages to the elements of music. An examination
of this book reveals that it was better adapted to singing societies
than for common schools. He earlier had written other books on
music, such as the Choral, and N ew England Glee Book; and later
The Dulcimer, Lute of Zion, Liber Mnsicns, and The Cythara.

The latter Was a comprehensive Work.

Song Books in the 1850’s. In 1852 J. W. Greene published his
School Melodies. This was a small but rather appealing song book
Written expressly for the use in schools. It was much less techni-
cal than most other song books of that period. The first selection
Was “The Scholars’ Pledge.” It began as follows: “Never the
Drnnkard’s drink Our lips shall stain; Ne’er shall the S'weare7"s
Words Our tongues profane.” The second selection was “Fair

Song—B00k of the School—Room, 1847, Mason and Webb——one of the most
popular.

Freedom” to be sung to the tune of “Cheer up, my lively lads.”

Also in 1852 Joseph and Horace Bird published their Singing
School Companion. This, like many other similar music books
during that period, was not written primarily for common schools.
In fact, the title page stated that it was designed for “singing and
common schools, social assemblies, choir practice, and for religious
worship.” It was a rather large and diﬂicult book. So likely its
use in the public schools was limited.

In 1855 E. H. Bascom wrote The School Harp. This was an
attractive book. The author stated that “a large proportion of the
Songs in this Work are original, and have been expressly written
for it.” Thus the songs Were rather simple and no doubt appealed
to children. The first selections in it were entitled: “Morning
Hymn,” “Little Things,” “Hope On, Hope Ever,” “Diligence,”
and “We’ll Study On.” It contained one—, two—, three-, and four-
part songs.

Other authors who wrote song books during the 1850’s were

Edward Chester, George Root, Schuyler Clark, Elias Mason, Wil-
liam Tarbutton, A. S. Cleaveland, L. O. Emerson, and T. Bissell.
Later editions by previously mentioned authors also were
published.
Song Books in the 1860’s. As
in the 1850’s, a number of
school song books were pub-
lished in the 1860’s. Among
them were books by John
Bower, W. O. and H. S. Per-
kins, Horace Waters, J. W.
Dodum, Charles Butler, 0. B.
Brown, and O. Blackman.

Up to this time most of the
music books were adapted
primarily for the upper grades
and high school, and the books

books, 1866.

were not prepared in series. However, 0. Blackman in the 1860’s
prepared a series of Graded Songs for Day Schools. The prices
were: No. 1, 10 cents; No. 2, 15 cents; No. 3, 25 cents; No. 4, 501
cents. The fact that these were prepared in graded series is
evidence that he was conscious of the varying ability of children
to learn music according to their ages and interests. Even in No.
3 the songs were only in one—part and two—part music. It will be

seen that these books were the forerunners of the song books of

the next decade, when grading and method would receive marked
attention.

Luther W. Mason (1821-1896). Luther Mason, who belonged to
a distant branch of the family of Lowell Mason, and who studied
under him, made nearly as great a contribution to public school
music as did Lowell. In 1864, after building up a musical repu-
tation in Kentucky and Ohio, he was called to Boston to organize
the instruction in music for the primary grades. Before this little
had been done in the primary level.

In 1870 he wrote the Primary or First Music Reader, and the
Second Music Reader. In 1871 the Third Music Reader was
published. At times these books were referred to as constituting
The National Music Course. He also prepared N ationalp Music
Charts to precede the Readers, and The National Music Teacher,
as a practical guide in teaching vocal music and sight-singing to
“even the youngest pupils.” The historian of public school music,
Birge,2 referred to him as the “founder of school music methodol-
ogy,” and added that the National Music Course was the ﬁrst
planned music course to receive national recognition. Too, these
books were translated into German for use in Europe. Even Japan
borrowed its methods for use there.

The First book was planned to review and then follow the
Charts. Thus the work in the ﬁrst part of the First book was
presented for the fourth time as follows: (1) Chieﬂy by rote,
(2) step by step from the blackboard, (3) practiced daily from
the charts, and (4) from the book. All the songs in it were in
one—part music. i

ton: Oliver Ditson Company, 1928. ‘

In the Second Music Reader two—part music was introduced.
Mason claimed that most people do some singing, in Sunday
School, church, or elsewhere, but most of it was haphazard sing-
ing. The purpose of this course was to start with a regular course
of instruction in rote singing. In this the pupils were expected to
be aided by their knowledge of the notes, so as to learn two-part

a singing by sight. This book was followed by the Third Music

Reader, in which three—part singing was introduced, “as based
upon the Triads of the lVIajor and Minor Scales.”

In 1886 Mason prepared The New Third Music Reader. It
was much larger than the earlier Third. This revised edition was
based largely upon a system developed by C. H. Hohmann, “show-
ing the harmonic relation of sounds.” Too, it contained fewer
three—part songs than the earlier edition. All of Luther Mason’s
music readers were published in numerous editions, particularly
after they became known as the National Music Course.

George B. Loomis. When he began to teach music in the Indian-
apolis schools in 1866 few suitable books were available, so he
began to prepare a series of music books in 1870. The ﬁrst one was
the First Steps in Music. In 1875 he revised it with the title,
First Book of Progressive Music Lessons. It was a carefully
graded book intended for thebeginning of music instruction in
the lower grades. Only one—part singing was used.

Soon the series included five books. In all, the series aimed to
guide in the teaching of music from its first principles to “full
chorus and glee singing.” The advance in part singing was not
as rapid as in Mason’s N atioual series. For example, the Third
Book did not include any three—part music. However, the Fourth
Book introduced three—part songs in the latter half of the book.
The prices of the books were as follows: No. 1, 18 cents; No. 2,
20 cents; No. 3, 30 cents; No. 44, 55 cents; and No. 5, $1.00.
These books gained a wide circulation in the midwest, where they
were originally published.

H. R. Palmer. In 1871 The Song King by H. R. Palmer was
published. It was intended for singing classes, day schools, con-
ventions, etc. This was a rather advanced book, which, if at all
used in public schools, must have been used only in the upper

PENMANSHIP, ART, AND MUSIC 353

grades. In 1891 he published the Graded Series “in the Art of
Reading Music at Sight.” It included lessons presented in sections
entitled Junior Grade, Senior Grade, Day School and Institute
Department, Temperance Department, and Miscellaneous. In
addition he wrote many other music books for Sunday schools,
churches, institutes, conventions, glee clubs, and singing classes.

Other Music Books in the 18’70’s. The 1870’s constituted a fruit-
ful decade for the publication of school music books. In addition to
the books by Mason, Loomis, and Palmer, a number of others
first were published then.

In 1873 N. Coe Stewart wrote the M erry Voices. This book,
like many other music books, was intended for multiple use in
schools, seminaries, and juvenile classes. It began with theory,
definitions, and signs, followed by sight exercises, and songs in-
volving one—, two—, three-,~and four—part singing. It certainly was
not well adapted for the lower grades.

The N ew Favorite by W. T. Giffe was published in 1875. Al-
though day schools were also mentioned for its use, it was primarily
suited for use in “singing schools, conventions, choirs, musical
societies, and musical academies.” It contained “musical notation,
exercises, glees, solos, duets, trios, quartets, hymn tunes, anthems,
choruses, etc.”

Music books were also written by H. S. Perkins, N. C. Burnap
and W. J. Wetmore, J. C. Bechel, George F. Root, and Hottie
S. Russell. 1

Music Books during the 1880’s. Apparently no important series
of music books was first written in the 1880’s, although later
editions and revisions of the popular books by Mason and Loomis
continued to appear. One of the first to appear in that decade was
the N atioual Kindergarten Songs and Plays by Mrs. Louise
Pollock in 1880. All except 20 pages consisted of songs presumed
to be suitable for kindergarten children. Mrs. Pollock was the
principal of the Kindergarten Normal Institute in Washington,
D.C. No attempt was made in the book to teach the elements of
music. The method of teaching music by ear was suggested.

In 1883 The Normal Music Course by John W. Tufts and

354 OLD TEXTBOOKS

H. E. Holt was published. This book was to supplement the Charts
by the same authors. The First Reader was divided into three
parts: (1) exercises and short songs, (2) introduction of two
part music and longer songs, and (3) a few rote songs to which
“pianoforte accompaniment” was added. Interesting pictures ap-
peared beside many of the songs. For example, a picture of sheep
appeared with the song of “Little Bo-Peep.” Many of the songs
related to things of nature, such as birds, animals, and ﬂowers.
The Normal Course appeared in numerous editions and revisions.

Also in 1883 (C. E.) Leslie’s Challenge appeared. No claim
for public school use was made by this book, yet the nature of
the earlier.songs in it appeared suitable for children. Many re-
lated to nature. Later he wrote the N ew Silver Carols (co-
authored with W. A. Ogden) in 1884:, The Cyclone of Song in
1888, and The Ensign in 1897.

In 1886 The Royal Proclamation, “Hear the Royal Proclama-
tion, Do, Ray, Mi, Sol, La, Si, Do,” by Aldine S. Kieﬁer and
William B. Blake was published. The book opened with twelve
pages of Theoretical Statements prepared by B. C. Unseld, Prin-
cipal Virginia Normal Music School. Throughout the book shaped
or “buckwheat” notes were used. Likely its chief use was in singing
schools rather than public schools.

In 1887 James R. Murray’s Dainty Songs for Little Lads
and Lassies was published. The ﬁrst selection was entitled “Dainty
Songs.” Its ﬁrst verse was:

Dainty songs for little lads,
Dainty songs for lasses;

Sing them with the happy birds,
’Mid the ﬂow’rs and grasses.

The next ﬁve selections were:
“Sweet Little Bird,” “Storm
and Sunshine,” “In the Snow-
ing,” “Happy Children,” and
“Room at the Top.” While

the titles of most songs were

appealing, the music was nearly all in three and four parts. It
contained 155 pages.

Music Textbooks during the 1890’s. In 1894: Frank Damrosch’s
Popular Method of Sight Singing appeared. The place for its
intended use wasn-ot made clear. It appeared too technical for
very young children, yet its lessons were developed step by step.
Fewer than half of the selections or exercises included words. Ap-
parently they were to be sung by note. It may well have been
used as a supplementary music book.

In 1895 Samuel W. Cole prepared The Child’s First Studies
in Music. This was a very attractive and well bound book with
a light blue cover. It did not begin with technical lessons. The
teacher was instructed to teach the children these songs by a
suggested procedure. The first song was “Come, Little Children,
and Sing.” All the songs appeared to be appealing to children.
The same author had also prepared a series of twenty charts for
supplementary use.

Also in 1895 J. D. Luseibegan a graded series of The Wreath
Music Course. In that year The Juvenile Wreath was published.
It contained 1454.4 pages of one and two part songs for primary
children, with a course of rudiments suited to the lower grades. In
1896 The Ideal Wreath appeared as a second book. It was for
the grammar grades and ungraded schools. It contained one-,
two-, three—, and four—part songs, with a more thorough treat-
ment of the rudiments. Later The Royal Wreath for high schools,
and in 1899 The Imperial Wreath for more advanced groups,
appeared. These were published by the author himself.

In 1896 B. C. Unseld’s The Choral Standard was published. It

claimed to comprise “a Complete Course of Instruction and a

Graded Collection of Music for Singing Schools, Day Schools,

Choirs and Conventions.” The same year he, together with J. H.
Fillmore, published the School Singer. It consisted of a graded
course of exercises for sight singing and a choice collection of
songs. Most of the songs were in four—part music.

School song books were also written in the 1890’s by M. M.
Appleberry, D. Wilson, Harry Deems, J. F. Kinsey, Emma
Thomas, John H. Haaren and W. Mattﬁeld, and Lydie A. Coon-

ley. Then, too, later editions by Showalter, Tufts and Holt,
Mason, Roberts, and Perkins appeared in that decade.

After 1900. The Writer has made no careful attempt to dealwith
the textbooks published after 1900, yet he does have music books
of The New Educational Music Course (1905) by James M.
McLaughlin and W. W. Gilchrist; the Laurel Songs (1914) by
M. Teresa Armitage; and The Progressive Music Series (1915)
by Parker, McConathy, Birge, and Miessner.

Concluding Comments. It is clear that music was a tardy entrant
in the American public school curriculum. However, singing
schools, apparently mostly taught in the evenings, began to de-
velop in the later colonial period and continued to thrive for
more than a century. Thus adults rather than children were the
first to be taught music in America.

The first city formally to provide for the teaching of music in
the public schools was Boston, in 1838. This was done largely
through the efforts of Lowell Mason, the father of public school
music in the United States. He was the author of many music
books for various purposes.

Most earlier music books were adapted chieﬂy for the upper
grades and the secondary schools. Then in the late 1860’s and
1870’s graded series of music textbooks appeared. The person who
Wrote the ﬁrst well-recognized series was Luther Mason. Other
rather popular series before 1900 were written by Loomis, Tufts
and Holt, and Luse.

Today most public schools teach not only vocal music, but also
many types of instrumental music. Most large high schools spon-
sor bands, orchestras, and glee clubs. Hence the greatest develop-
ment of music in the public schools has really been since 1900.
