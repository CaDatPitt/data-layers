1855.The word Comma is derived from the Greek language, and properly
designates a segment, section, or part cut off from a complete sentence.
In its usual acceptation, it signifies the point which marks the smaller
segments or portions of a period. It therefore represents the shortest
pause. and consequently marks the least constructive, or most dependent
parts of a sentence.
The word colon is from the Greek, and signifies a member, and the
Latin prefix semi means half. A Semicolon is used for the purpose of
pointing out those parts of a compound sentence, which, although they
each constitute a distinct proposition, have yet a dependence upon each
nther, or on some common clause.
The Colon is used to divide a sentence into two or more parts, which,
ilthough the senlse be complete in each, are not independent.
The word Period is derived from the Greek, and means a circuit.
When the circuit of the sense is completed, with all its relations, the
mark bearing this name is used to denote: this completion.
The word Interriogation is derived from the Latin, and means a ques
tion..h'. word Exclamation is from the same language, and means a pas
sionate utterance.
The word Parenthesis is derived from the Greek language, and means
an insertion. A sentence, clause, or phrase, inserted between the parts
of another sentence for the purpose of explanation, or of calling particular attention, is properly called a parenthesis.
It is to be remarked, however, that the name parenthesis belongs only
to the sentence inserted between brackets or crotchets, and not to those
marks themselves.
The word Hyph7en is derived from the Greek language, and signifies
under one, that is, together; and is used to imply that the letters or sylla
bles between which it is placed are to be taken together as one word.
The hyphen, when placed over a vowel, to indicate the long sound of
the vowel, is called the lIacron, from the Greek, signifying long.
The mark called a Breve, indicating the short sound of the vowel, is
from the Latin, signifying short.
The word Ellipsis, also from the Greek, means an omission, and properly refers to the words, the menibers, or the sentences which are omitted,
and not to the marks which indicate the omission.
The word Apostrophe, also from the Greek, signifies the turning arvay,
or the omission of one letter or more.*
The word Diceresis is also from the Greek, and signifies the taking
apart, or the separation of the vowels, which would otherwise be pronounced as one syllable.
The term Accent is derived from the Latin language, and implies the
tone of the voice with which a word or syllable is to be pronounced.
* The word Apostrophe, as here used, must not be confoulded with the same word aa
the name of a rhetorical figure.

inflection of the voice is required at each of the questions; [see Lesson 6th,.]
and it will be noticed throughout this lesson that the ellipsis is supplied in
parentheses in many sentences where it may appear to be superfluous; but
the author's design in sb doing is to lead more directly to the proper intonation
of the v)ice.  As a particular instance of this kind, see No. 615, 616,
and 618.

conducting you to it.)    Then (they each niade) a bow down

kind condescension?;
This example shows very clearly how the proper intonation of the voice is
intimated by supplying the ellipses, although the sense is sufficiently clear as
the sentence is expressed.
t It may here be observed, that a pause should be made in every elliptical
sentence long enough to pronounce, or rather to think over, the words which
are omitted. The extract above affords a clear illustration of this remark.
See the directions, at the beginning of this lesson.
t It may perhaps be thought that some ellipses are unnecessarily supplied
in the preceding sentences; but the practical teacher will readily allow that a
correct analysis is indispensable to the correct readingg of a sentence, and that
the facilities afforded to a child in his fialst attempts, cannot be too great. It
will be borne in mind that this book is designed for very young, as well as for
more advanced putpils.

LESSON XXX.
AN TITHESIS.
The word Antithesis means oppositiont or contrast.       In all
sentences in which. an emphatic word occurs, there is an antitlhesis expressed or undeirstood; ancd  it is necessary to be able
to distinguish the words which form     the antithesis, or which
are contrasted, in orcler to ascertain which word should be
emphasized.    Thus, in the sentence given in the introduction
to the 23d lesson -"     Shall you ride to-town to-day? "if the answer be, " No, I shall walk," there is an antithesis, or
contrast, in the words ride and walk, which shows that ride
is the emphlatic word.  Again, if the answer be, " No, I shall
ride znto the country," the antithesis is in the words town and
country, which shows that the word town is the emphatic
word.   Once mtore, if the answer be, " No, but I shall go
to-morrow," the antithesis is in the words to-day and to-morrow, which shows that the word to-day is to be enzphasized.
[It is thus seen, that it is necessary that the pupil should study out
the meaning of a sentence, and be able to form the antithesis upon
which the emphatic words denend, in order to read it correctly and
expressively. Tllis exercise will often require a degree of judgment
and discrimination not to be expected in a child, until the assistance of
the teacher comes to his aid. Indeed, it is this very thing which constitutes the whole ART of reading, and which often renders it a subject
of(deep study even to matured minds. It is, however,  a subject of
such paraimount importance, that it mnust not be overlooked or neglected- even in the lessons of very young pupils. The assistance afforded the pupil in this lesson, will lead his mind, it is thought, to a
correct understanding of the subject, and enable hinm to apply his
powers successfully to the analysis of other sentences, in which no
aid is furnished for him.']
* The great importance of a correct untlerstandino of this principle will be
seen in the followingl passages froill hloly writ, which are frequently read from
the sacred desk as follows:--
"As much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all MEN." Now, if the emphasis be thus placed on the word men, it would seeni as if the apostle would
imply that it is a d(uty to live peaceably with men only, but that witlh wome.n
and children we may live in a different manner. But by placing the emphasis
on the word all, the inconsistency is removed; thus,
"As much as lieth in you, live peaceably with ALL men."
Again, in the fourth commandment, if the emphasis be put on the word da,
as many read it, tlhus, " Remember that thou keel) holy the Sabbath DAY,"
it wotuld seem that the ni,rht mligiht be (lifferenlly occtupied. The comrnnandINTRODUCTORY LESSONS.
In this lesson the emphatic words which form    the antitheszs
are printed in capitals, aind the member of the antithesis
whlich  is understood is supplied in     Italic letters betweein
crotchets.  The pupil willfirst read the zhole passage, and
then read it with the omission of the part in crotchets.

ment undoubtedly should be read, "Remember that thou keep holy the SAB
BATH day.
The following passage was read from the sacred desk by one of the mosl
correct readers of the day, in the hearing of the author of this volume, threec
times, with a false emphasis on the word men; thus,
" O0 that MEN would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness, and doeclare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men."
This reading gives rise to the question whether women and children, anld
even angels, &amp;c., should not praise the Lord for his goodness. The emphasis
undoubtedly should be placed on the word praise; thus, " O that mein would
therefore PRAISE the Lord for his goodness, and declare the WONDERS
that he doeth for the children of men.'
This principle of antithesis must be carefully studied by all who aim at correct reading. The difference in style which characterizes the most eminllent
speakers and readers is much affected by their peculiar understanding of the
meaning of an author, and of consequence the manner in whiclh they mentally supply the ellipsis forming the antithesis.

lash them in a DIFFERENT manner.)

your DIVERSION alone, but it) seems to carry this LESSON:
Choose Inot alone a proper MATE, but proper TIME to marry.
636. As much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all
MEN, (but not with all WOMEN.)
637. You did not read that last sentence correctly; for
by emphasizing the word MEN, you made it appear as if the
apostle meant that you might quarrel with WOMEN and C1ILDREN, (if you would live peaceably with MEN.) Now, his
meaning is, that you should live peaceably with ALL men,
(not with your FRIENDS alone, but witll ALL MANKIND.)
Therefore you should read it thus: As much as lieth in
you, live peaceably with ALL men.
[Sometimes both the words which constitute the antithesis
are expressed, as in thefollowitng sentence.]
638. It is from UNTAMED PASSIONS, not from WILD BEASTS,

SINGLE lion, bear, or serpent, but) the WHOLE RACE of lions,
bears, and serpents.
LESSON XXXI.
ENUMERATION.
Whlen a number of particulars are mentioned in a sentence,
it is called an Enumeration.

kind. In order to assist the pupil, the acute and grave ac
cents are used to designate the inflections of the voice, accordl
ing to the principles stated in Lesson 22, page 70.
640. But who the melodies of morn can tell?- The wild
brook babbling down the mountain's side; the lowing herd;
the sheepfold's simple bell; the pipe of early shepherd, dim
descried in the lone valley; echoing far and wide, the clamorous horn along the cliffs above; the hollow murmur of
the ocean tide; the hum of bees; the linnet's lay of love;
and the full choir * that wakes the universal grove.
641. Oh, how canst thou renounce the boundless store of
charms that Nature to her votary yields! The warbling
woodland, the resounding shore, the pomp of groves, the
garniture of fields; all that the genial ray of morning gilds,
and all that echoes to the song of even; all that the mountain's sheltering bosom shields, and all the dread magnificence of heaven, - oh,. how canst thou renounce, and hope
to be forgiven?
642. The coffin was let down to the bottom of the grave,
the planks were removed from the heaped up brink, the first
rattling clods had struck their knell, the quick shoveling was
over, and the long, broad, skillfully-cut pieces of turf were
aptly joined together, and trimly laid by the beating spade, so
that the newest mound in the churchyard was scarcely distinguishable from those that were grown over by the undisturbed grass and daisies of a luxuriant spring.
643. The poor child of nature knew not the God of revelation, but the God of the universe he acknowledged in every
thing around him. He beheld him in the star that sank in
beauty behind his lonely dwelling; in the sacred orb that
flamed on him from his midway throne; in the flower that
snapped in the morning breeze; in the lofty pine, that defied
a thousand whirlwinds; in the timid warbler, that never left
its native gro6ve; in the fearless eagle, whose untired pinion
was wet in clouids; in the worm that crawled at his fo6t; and
in" his own matchless f6rm, glowing with a spark of that light,
to whose mysterious source he bent in humble, though blind
adoration.
644. Our lives, says Seneca, are spent either in doing
nothing at a11, or in doing nothing to the purpose, or in
doing nothing that we ought to do.

646. All other arts of perpetuating our ideas, except writing or printing, continue but a short time. Statues can last
but a few thousands of years, edifices fiwer, and colors still
fewer than edifices.
647. Life consists, not of a series of illustrious actions, or
elegant enjoyments; the greater part of our time passes in
compliance with necessities, in the performance of daily
duties, in the removal of small inconveniences, in the procurement of petty pleasures.
648. Though we seem grieved at the shortness of life in
general, we are constantly wishing every period of it at.an
end. The minor longs to be of age, then to be a man of
business, then to make up an estate, then to arrive at h6nors,
then to retire.
649. The devout man does not only believe, but feeils
there is a Deity; he has actual sensations of him; his experience concurs with his reason; he sees him more in all his
intercourse with him; and even in this life almost loses his
faith in conviction.
650. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are
these; adiiltery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath,
strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drmunkenness,
revellings, and such like.
651. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.
652. The ill-natured man, though but of equal parts with
the good-natured man, gives himself a large field to expatiate
in; he exposes those failings in human nature over which the
other would cast a veil, laughs at vices which the other
either excuses or conceals, falls indifferently on friends or
6nemies, exposes the person who has obliged him, and, in
short, sticks at nothing that may establish his character of
a wit.
653. What can interrupt the content of the fair sex, upon
whom one age has labored after another to confer honors,
and accumulate immurnities?  Those to whom rudeness is
infamy, and insult is cowardice? Whose eye commands the
brave, and whose smile softens the severe?  Whom   the
sailor travels to adorn, the soldier bleeds to defend, and the
poet wears out life to celebrate; who claim tribute from

endeavor to multiply delights, without requiring from them
any return but willingness to be pleased.
654. Nature has laid out all her art in beautifying the
face; she has touched it with vermilion; made it the seat of
smiles and bluishes; lighted it up and enlivened it with the
brightness of the eyes; hung it on each side with curious organs of sense; given it airs and graces that cannot be described, and surrounded it with such a flowing shade of hair,
as sets all its beauties in the most agreeable light.
655. Should the greater part of the people sit down and
draw up a particular account of their time, what a shameful
bill would it be!  So much in eating, and'drinlking, and
sleeping, beyond what nature requires; so much in revelling
and wantonness; so much for the recovery of the last night's
intemperance; so much in gaming, plays, and masquerades;
so much in paying and receiving formal and impertinent
visits; so much in idle and foolish prating, in censuring and
reviling our neighbors; so much in dressing out our bodies
and talking of fashions; and so much wasted and lost in
doing nothing at all.
656. They, through faith, subdued kingdoms, wrought
righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouth of lions,
quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the
sword, out of weakness were made str6ng, waxed valiant in
fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
657. I conjure you V.y that which you profess, (howe'er
you came to know it,) answer me. Though you untie the
winds, and let them fight against the churches; thouigh the
yesty waves confound and swallow navigation up; though
bladed corn be lodged, and trees blown down; though castles

sicken, answer me to what I ask you.

inclination a third, and perhaps reason contrary to all, a man

661. As the genius of Milton was wonderfully turned to
the sublime, his subject is the noblest that could have entered
into the thoughts of man.  Every thing that is truly great
and astonishing has a place in it. The whole system of the
intellectual world, the chaos and the creation, heaven, earth,
and hell, enter into the constitution of his poem.
662. Labor, or exercise, ferments the huimors, casts them
into their proper channels, throws off redundancies, and
helps nature in those secret distribuitions, without which, the
body cannot subsist in its vigor, nor the soul act with cheerfillness.
LESSON XXXII.
IRONY.
Irony consists in such expressions as are intended to convey a meaning directly opposite to what the words imply.
Thus, when we say of a boy who never gets his lesson, that he
is an admirable scholar, this is called IRONY.
Thle word or words which are ironical, are generally to be
emphasized, sometimes with the circumflex, and sometimes with
the other accents. In the following sentences the ironical parts
are printed in Italic letters, and the pupil will manage his
voice in pronouncing the accented words, according to the
principles. explained in Lesson 22, page 69.
663. They will give enlightened freedom  to our minds,

IN READING.
109INTRODUCTION.
The word Section, derived also from the Latin, signifies A cutting, or
a division. The character which denotes a section seems to be composed of ss, and to began abbreviation of the words signurn sectionis, or
the sign of a section. This character, which was formerly used as the
sign of the division of a discourse, is now rarely used except as a refer
ence to a note at the bottom of the page.
The word Paragraph is derived from the Greek language, and signifies an ascription in the margin. This mark, like that of the section,
was formerly used to designate those divisions of a section which are
now indicated by unfinished lines or blank spaces. This mark, as well
as the section, is now rarely used except as a reference.
It may further be remarked, that notes at the bottom of the page, op
the margin, or at the end of the book, are often indicated by figures, o.
by letters, instead of the marks which have already been enumerated.
The word Caret is from the Latin, and signifies it is rvanting. This
mark is used only in manuscript.
The Cedilla is a mark placed under the letters c and g to indicate the
soft sound of those letters.
The Asterisk, Obelisk, Double Obelisk, and Parallels, with the section
and paragraph, are merely arbitrary marks to call attention to the notes
at the bottom of the page.
As these marks which have now been enumerated all have a meaning,
and are employed for some special purpose, it is recommended to the
teacher never to allow the pupil to pass by them without being assured
that he or she understands what that purpose is. Correct and tasteful
reading can never be attained without a full appreciation of the meaning
which the author intended to convey; and that meaning is often to be
ascertained by the arbitrary marks employed for the purpose of giving
definiteness to an expression. At the same time the teacher should be
careful that the pupil shall consider these marks as his guide to the
meaning only, not to the enunciation, of a sentence. Correct delivery
must be left to the guidance of taste and judgment only.
In many excellent selections for lessons in reading, the pieces have
been arranged in regular order, according to the nature of their respective
subjects, under the heads of Narrative, Descriptive, Didactic, Argumentative and Pathetic pieces, Public Speeches, Promiscuous pieces, the
Eloquence of the Bar, of the Pulpit, and of the Forum.
By Narrative pieces is meant those pieces only which contain a simple

LESSON XXXIV.
THE SLUR.*
The Slur is the name given to such a management of tAe
vroce as is opposed to emphasis.       When a word or part of a
sentence is emphasized, it is to be pronounced with a louder
and moreforcible effort of the voice, and it is frequently to
be prolonged.    But when a sentence or part of a sentence is
SLURRED, it is to be read like a parenthesis,t in an altered
tone of voice, more rapidly, and not so forcibly, and with all
the words pronounced nearly alike.t
The parts which are to be SLURRED in this lesson are printed
in Italic letters, and the words on which emphatic force is to
be bestowed are printed in capitals, as in Lesson 24, page 75.
proof of the utility and efficacy of the principle, he has little doubt that it will
be acknowledged as a valuable aid in teaching the art of reading.
* The following remarks upon the slur were communicated to the author by a
distinguished teacher.
" In order to communicate clearly and forcibly the whole signification of a
passage, it must be subjected to a rigid analysis. It will then be found, that
often one paramount idea pervades the sentence, although it niay be associated
with incidental statements, and qualified in every possible manner. It is the
province of the reader, by appropriate inlflections and modulations of the voice,
to communicate to the listener every shade of meaning, be it more or less delicate. The primary idea, then, will require a forcible utterance, while the other
portions will be thrown into the shade. For want of a better name, we may
designate as' The Slur' that particular element in elocution, by which those
parts of a sentence of less comparative importance, are rendeled less ilrmpes
sive to the ear.
" It will be understood, that the use of stress, alone, can by no means make a
reader indeed, it is certain that the best elocutionists are they who most
adroitly blend emphasis and slur. The presence of the slur generally ilnplies
the existence of emphasis; and the former is often used to set an emphatic
word or phrase in stronger relief.
" A slurred passage must generally be read in a lower and less forcible
tone of voice, and more rapidly than the context; and this element (niamely,
the slur) must be employed in cases of parenthesis, contrast, repetition, or explanation, where the sentence is of small comparative importance and often
where quzalification of time, place, or manner is made."
t See page 48, Lesson 16.
t On the management of the slur, much of the beauty and propriety of
enunciation depends; especially in all sentences in which parentheses abound.
How much soever a sentence may be cuinbered with explanatory details, or
interrupted and obscured by parentheses and unimportant adjuncts, the reader,
by a proper management of the slur, can always bring forward the most important particulars into a strong light, and throw the rest into shade thereby
entirely changing the character of the sentence, and making it appear lucid,
strong, and expressive.. 10*TRODUCTORY LESSONS.

LESSON XXXV.
MEASURE OF SPEECH.*
In Lesson 10th, page 16th, the pupil was infbrmed that a palse is
sometimes made in reading, whlere there is no pause in the book. The
pause to which allusion is there made, is rendered necessary to allow
the reader to take breath. This lesson is designed to explain to the
pupil another sort of pause, or rather interruption of the voice, caused
by the peculiar operation of the organs of speech.
Dr. Rush, in his work "On the Human Voice," has remarked, with
regard to the manner in which children learn to read, that " the close
attention which their ignorance requires, and their slowness of utterance, lead them to lay an equal stress upon every syllable, or at least
upon every word. This habit continues a-long time after the eye has
acquired a facility in following up discourse, and in some cases infects
pronunciation throughout subsequent life."
The object of this lesson, which is entitled " Measure of Speech," is
twofold: 1st. To teach the pupil so to manage, his voice, in conformity
with the natural operation of the organs of speech, as to break up the
monotonous, or " equal" manner of reading above nmentioned, and to
introduce such an agreeable variety, as will cause peculiar melody of
utterance; and, 2dly. To enable him to read in such a mariner that he
will not be " out of breath," and consequently to exercise his voice
without fatigue.
A MEASURE OF SPEECH          consists of an accented and an
unaccented portion of sound, produced by one effort of the
vozce.
In pronouncing an accented syllable, the voice makes an effort,
which must be repeated, if the next syllable is flso an accented syllable. But if the next syllable or syllables be unaccented, the voice
can pronounce them all with a single effort. Thus the words spirt,
spirit, spiritual, or spiritually, may each be pronounced with a single
effort or pulsation of- the voice.
The teacher who would thoroughly understand the subject treated in this
lesson, and who aims at excellence in the art of reading, is referred to the
very valuable and scientific work of Dr. Rush, of Philadelphia, entitled the
" Philosophy of the Human Voice," or to Dr. Barber's Grammnar of Elocution,
a work founided on the priniciples advanced by Dr. Rush. Dr. Barber, whose
opinion on the subject has great wveight, says, " In Dr. Rush's work, the reader
may repair to a fountain at once deep and full." In another place, Dr. Barber
assures " every public speaker, and every philosophical actor, that he will fail
in his duty to himself, if he neglects a diligent perusal of Dr. Rush's Philosophy
of the Voice." The same may also be said in relation to Dr. Barber's own
work. From the works of both these gentlemen, the author hlas derivecl as--
sistance in the preparation of these Exercises.pleas, as they are technically called) made by disting'uished lawyers in
the courts of justice in favor of or against a supposed criminal. The
Eloquence of the Pulpit consists of sermons or discourses delivered on
religious occasions.  The Eloquence of the Forum  consists in the
speeches, addresses, orations, &amp;c., addressed to political or promiscuous
assemblies.
To many, this information may seem superfluous or puerile. But as
this volume is designed for the young and the unlettered, it must not be
forgotten that their sources of information are few, and that they will
not always take the pains to inform themselves of'the meaning of words,
even when they are familiar to their eyes in capital letters, and in the
running titles of the boolts before them every day. It is often the case,
that the teacher also, taking for granted that his pupils are familiar with
the meaning of words so often presented to their eyes, neglects to questlon them on the subject; and in riper years it becomes a matter of
surprise to the pupil himself, that, in early life, words which he had
heard sounded almost every day at school presented no idea to his mind
beyond that of an unmeaning, or rather an unintelligible sound.
The object of all education is not so much to fill the mind with knowledge as to strengthen its powers, and elnlarge its capacity. Those exercises, therefore, are always most beneficial, in all education, which tend
most effectually to this result. There is, perhaps, no branch of study
connected with popular education, which, when properly pursued,
is more highly subservient to this end thain the study of correct
aiid tasteful reading, as an art. It necessarily involves a complete
knowledge of the subject to be read, the relation and dependences of
the phrases, clauses, and members of the sentences, the proper meaning' of the words employed, and the connection between the sentences
themselves. This cannot be acquired without a vigorous employment
of the perceptive powers, aided by those of comparison, of analysis, of
reasoning, of judgment, of taste, and of discrimination. Subordinatt
and auxiliary to the acquisition of this important art, on the part of the
pupil, it is here recommended that the teacher should exercise also the.
power of classification, by requiring his pupils, while studying a reading
lesson, (which, by the way, always should be studied, previous to practising it,) to ascertain and to inform his teacher under which of the above
mentioned classes, whether narrative, descriptive, didactic, &amp;c., the piece
he is about to read belongs. The teacher who thus employs the faculties
of his pupils cannot fail to see a vigorous growth df intellect springing
up under his culture, and will be amply compensated for such mortifications as may occasionally arise during fornzal examinateons from the
treacnery of the youthful memory, or the want of a prcper command
over its stores.
One of the best selections of reading lessons which has been in use
in the common schools of this country is that of Mr. Lindley Mlurray,
called "The English Reader."  Whether estimated by its moral and
12
INTRODUCTION.120                 INTRODUCTORY LESSONS.
It may here be remarked, that it is not material whether the syl.
lables belong to the same word. The voice may utter, with a-single
effort, several syllables, even when they constitute different words.
Thus each of the following lines may be pronounced by a single effort
or pulsation of the voice:Came to the -
When he was in'Twas at theDoes to theOft did theUtterable, &amp;c.
But when two accented syllables follow one another, there must be a
distinct effort or pulsation of the voice to pronounce each. Thus the
words fate, hate, both being accented, require a distinct effort or pulsation of the voice for the pronunciation of each; and a pause must be
made between each, long enough to pronounce an unaccented syllable.
It will thus be seen, that the two syllables fatal, or hating,o, can be pronounced by the same effort that is required to pronounce the syllables
fate and hate. And here it may be remarked that, while an accented
syllable requires a distinct efibrt or pulsation of the voice in pronouncing it, an unaccented syllable is uttered without such effort.
This distinction of the voice, in pronouncing accented and unaccented
syllables, is called by Dr. Barber, in his Grammar of Elocution, the
pulsative and the remiss action of the voice.
An accented syllable, therefore, is uttered by the pulsative *
action of the voice.
An unaccented syllable is uttered by the remiss * action of
the voice.
A perfect measure of speech consists of one syllable, or any
number of syllables, (not exceeding five,) uttered during one
pulsation and renmission of the voice.
It may here be remarked, that a single syllable may constitute a
measure; for if it be extended in sound, the first part of that sound
may be accented or heavy, and the latter unaccented or light. But a
short syllable will not constitute a measure.
More than one syllable cannot be uttered during the pulsative effort
of the voice; while one, two, three, and even four, can be uttered
during the remiss action; as in the word spiritually, in which the
first syllable spir, is pronounced by the pulsative, and the syllables
itually by the remiss action of the voice.' As a proper understanding of these terms is deemed essential to a clear
compreheiision of the principle on }which this lesson is founded, the teacher
who wishes a fuller development of the subject, is referred to Dr. Barber's
Grammar of Elocution--or to Dr. Rush's work, already mentioned, on the
Philosophy of the Human Voice, Section 4,9th, entitled "'the Rhythmus of
Speech."An imperfect measure of speech consists. of a single syllable on which the acute accent is placed, -or of a syllable or
syllables which are unaccented.
In the following examples for reading, the lines are divided into several parts, which are separated by a mark like
this I called a bar, and the parts divided by the bars are all
PERFECT or IMPERFECT MEASURES OF SPEECH.
The accented syllables, or those which require the pulsative effort of the voice, are noted by a star: under them,
and the unaccented syllables, or those which require the remiss action of the voice, have hyphens - under them.
The time occupied in reading each portion between the
bars must be equal, whether the-bar includes a perfect or
imperfect measure of speech.     A bar may contain an imperfect measure; the accented or the unaccented portions of the
measure being omitted. In that case, a mark like this'] is
inserted, to indicate a rest or stop long enough to pronounce
the portion which is omitted.:
[In reading the following passages, the pupil will recollect
that all the syllables which have a star under them    are accented-that all which have the hyphen under them            are
unaccented --and that all the marks like this r indicate that
a pause is to be made long enough to pronounce an unaccented
syllable.]
722.: In the i second     / century   j: of the I Christian
era  r the    emnpire of Rome         compre-    hended the I
fairest  part of the    earth    ] and the     most     Icivilized   portion of man-     kind.' Dr. Rush, in the very valuable work alread)y mentioned, has the following
remarks in relation to the method of marking and dividing sentences here introduced:-  
"'This notation will not, indeed, inform us what syllables are to be emphatic,
nor where the pauses are to be placed; but it will enable a master, who knows
how to order all these things in speech, to furnish that which most men require
for every thing they do - a copy. If a boy is taught by this method, he acquires the habit of attention to the subjects of accentuation anld pause, which.
may be readily applied in ordinary discourse."

[The pupil will observe that prose as well as poetry is
made up of similar measures of -speech. The only difference in sound, between poetry and prose, is, that poetry or
verse consists of a regular succession of similar measures,
which produce a harmonious impression on the ear; while
in prose, the different kinds of measure occur promiscuously,
without any regular succession. The following example
affords an instance of prose divided off into measures.]

IN READING.religious tone, or by the taste and beauty of the selections, it must
equally command the approbation of all to whom the subject of education is consigned. It is true that the compiler had not learnt the modern
art of selecting from the productions of editors, members of school com
rmittees, and others, whose vanity might, perhaps, aid the circulation of
his work, -but he has made ample amends for this kind of neglect, by
presenting the choicest gems of English literature, selected from the
brightest stars of that galaxy familiarly known as the British classics.
His introductory tract, for many of the observations in'which he has
acknowledged his indebtedness to Dr. Blair and to the Encyclopedia
Britannica, contains so much valuable instruction on the art of reading,
that the author of this work is persuaded that he cannot render better
service than by presenting it entire. Many of the suggestions, it will be
seen, are followed out in the introductory lessons in this volume; but as
all information becomes the better fixed by repetition, such repetition will,
to say the least, be pardonable, even though it may be deemed superfluous.
" OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD READING
"To read with propriety is a pleasing and important attainment,
productive of improvement both to the understanding and the heart. It
is essential to a complete reader, that he minutely perceive the ideas,
andcl enter into the feelings of the author, whose sentiments he professes
to repeat: for how is it possible to represent clearly to others, what we
have but faint or inaccurate conception of ourselves? If there were no
other benefits resulting from the art of reading well, than the necessity
it lays us under of precisely ascertaining the meaning of what we read,
and the habit thence acquired of doing this with facility, both when
reading silently and aloud, they would constitute a sufficient compensation for all the labor we canl bestow upon the subject. But the pleasure
derived to ourselves and others from a clear communicatio,. of ideas
and feelings, and the strong and durable impressions made thereby on
the minds of the reader and the audience, are considerations --hich give
additional importance to the study of this necessary and useful art.
The perfect attainment of it doubtless requires great attention and practice, joined to extraordinary natural powers; but as there are many
degrees of excellence in the art, the student whose aims fall short of
perfection will find himself amply rewarded for every exertion he may
think proper to make.
"To give rules for the management of the voice in reading, by which
the necessary pauses, emphasis, and tones, may be discovered and put
in practice, is not possible. After all the directions that can be offered
on these points, much will remain to be taught by the living instructor:
much will be attainable by no other means than the force of example,
influencing the imitative powers of the learner.  Some rules anld principles on these heads will, however, be found useful, to prevent erroneous
and vicious modes of utterance; to give the young reader some taste
for the subject; and to assist him in acquiring a just and accurate mode
of delivery. The observations which we have to make, for these purposes, may be comprised under the following heads: Proper Loudness
of Voice; Distinctnzess; Slowness; Propriety of Pronunciation; Emphasis;
Tones; Pauses; and llode of Beading Verse.

The preceding examples, including both poetry and prose, it is
thought, will be sufficient to explain the principle embraced in this
lesson, entitled the Measure of Speech. The pupil should endeavor
in all his reading exercises, to form the sentences, whether of poetry
)r prose, into measures, for the purpose of reading with facility and
vithout fatigue. The pauses or rests which occur in the imperfect.
measures, will afford him an opportunity of taking breath at such intervals, that, in the words of Dr. Barber, " reading will cease to be
laborious, and tile sense will be rendered clear, as far as it is dependent on the capital point of the distribution of time, or measure."  The
principle explained in this lesson, when well understood, and judiciously applied, will make the puipil acquainted with the nature of all
the different kinds of versification; for he will perceive that all the
varieties of poetry (or verse) are dependent upon the regular succession of the various measures of speech." "
LESSON XXXVI.
MANNER OF READING POETRY.
The division of poetry into verses, addressing themselves to the
eye, is often the cause of what is called a " sing song " utterance, which
it should be the study of every good reader to avoid. [See note on
page 122.]
In the last lesson, the attention of the pupil was drawn to the MEAsURE OF SPEECH- a subject, which, although it is very important in
prose, is doubly so in the reading of poetry or verse, as it determines
a question which has long been debated by teachers of the art of reading, viz. whether a pause should be made at the end of every line.
It is maintained by a very respectable writer, that in reading' blank
verse,' "we ougllt to make every line sensible to the ear; for what"
(it is asked by the writer) " is the use of the melody, or for what end
has the poet composed in verse, if, in reading his lines, we suppress hil
" A greater variety of exercises for reading, divided into measures, may be
found in Dr. Barber's Giammar of Elocution.
They, who have any curiosity to know the manner in which Garrick pronounced Hamlet's Soliloquy on Death, are referred to Steele's Prosodia
Rationalis, (edition of 1779, j. 40, et seq.,) where it is divided into measures,
and accented. Dr. Barber's method of dividing' speech is identical with Mr.
Steele's.IN READING.                          137
numbers, by omitting the final pause, and degrade them, by our pronunciation, into mere prose? "
The remarks made in the previous lesson are a sufficient reply to
this question. It is there stated that all sentences that are, or can be,
read or pronounced, are divisible into measures; and that the only
difference there is in sound between prose and verse is, that verse consists of a regular succession of similar measures, while in prose the
different kinds of measure occur promiscuously, without any regular
succession. Now, if this be the case, as it undoubtedly is, there will
be no necessity of a pause at the end of the line, to render the melody
sensible to the ear. Indeed, it will be impossible for the reader, who
pays proper attention to the measures into which all poetical lines are
divided, to conceal the melody which the lines possess. The art of
the poet, so far as the harmony is concerned, consists in such an arrangement of his measures, as to leave little for the reader to do, in
order to convey the melody to the hearer; and those lines which require' humoring,' in order that the music of the versification may be
distinguished, have little title to the name of verse.
The only direction, therefore, which it is necessary to give the
pupil in reading verse is, to endeavor to forget, or rather to disregard,
the division of the sentences into lines, and to read with the same inflections, accent, tone, eniphasis, and expression, that he would use
in reading prose.
In addition to the remarks which were made in the last lesson in
relation to the pauses caused by imperfect measures of speech, it remains to be observed that there is generally a pause, which belongs
exclusively to poetry, called the CE.SURA,* or the Ciesural pause.
This pause must always be properly regarded; and in studying a
reading lesson in verse, the pupil must be careful to ascertain where
this pause belongs. It is generally made after the fourth, fifth, or
sixth syllable in the line; but it is sometimes found after the third or
the seventh, and occasionally even after the second or the eighth.
In the following lines, the place where the cr.sura, or the cesural
pause, is to be made, is indicated by a figure, and the parallel lines 11;
and in reading them, the pupil will remember to make a slight pause
when he comes to the figure.

The ccesura after the 4th syllable.
The Savior comes, 4 11 by ancient bards foretold.
754.
The ccesura after the 5th syllable.
From storms a shelter, 5 j1 and from'heat a shade.
* The word ccesura means a cut, or division. An attentive observer will
not fail to notice that the beauty and grace of English versification depends
much upon the situation of the caesura. The poet has it in his power, by
diversifying its position, to give his numbers a grateful variety, which they
wTould not otherwise possess. They, who would see this subject more fully
discussed, will find some valuable remarks in the work of Dr. Carey, entitled
"Practical Eng,lish Prosody," London ed. 1816, p. 59.

Thle casura after tile 2d syllable.
Happy, 2 I without the privilege of will.
759.
The caesura after the 8th syllable.
In different individuals 8 1I we find.
In some lines, besides the cisura, there is also what is
called the demi-caesura, or half cesura, at which the pause is
very slight, as in the following lines, in which the demi-cmsura is marked with a single accent, and the caesura with a.iouble accent.

Glows' in the stars, " and blossoms in the trees;
Lives' through all life "; extends' through all extent,
Spreads' undivided," operates' unspent.
The ptpil will recollect that no pause must be made, and especially that the falling infilection of the voice mutst not be used
at thle end of the line, unless the sense requires it.  In the
following' eatract, the pause, with the falling inflection, occurs
in that part of the line indicated by the grave accent.  Tihe

force, and more rcapidly.

But bind him to his native mountains more.

IN READING.  INTRODUCTION.
"PROPER LOUDNESS OF VOICE.'"The first attention of every person who reads to others, doubtless,
must be to make himself heard by all those to whom he reads. He
must endeavor to fill with his voice the space occupied by the company.
This power of voice, it may be thought, is wholly a natural talent. It
is, in a good measure, the gift of nature; but it may receive considerable
assistance from art. 3M-uch depends, for this purpose, on the proper pitch
and management of the voice. Every person has three pitches in his
voice; the high, the middle, and the low one. The high is that which
he uses in calling aloud to some person at a distance. The low is when
he approaches to a whisper. The middle is that which he employs in
common conversation, and which he should generally use in reading to
others. For it is a great mistake, to imagine that one must take the
highest pitch of his voice, in order to be well heard in a large company.
This is confounding two things which are different - loudness or strength
of sound, with the key or note in which we speak. There is a variety
of sound within the compass of each key. A speaker may, therefore.
render his voice louder, without altering the key; and we shall always
be able to give most body, most persevering force of sound, to that pitch
of voice to which in conversation we are accustomed.  Whereas by
setting out on our highest pitch or key, we certainly allow ourselves loss
compass, and are likely to strain our voice before we have done. We
shall fatigue ourselves, and read with pain; and whenever a person
speaks with pain to himself, he is always heard with pain by his
audience. Let us, therefore, give the voice full strength and swell of
sound; but always pitch it on our ordinary speaking key. It should be
a constant rule never to utter a greater quantity of voice than we can
afford without pain to ourselves, and without any extraordinary effort.
As long as we keep within these bounds, the other organs of speech will
be at liberty to discharge their several offices with ease; and we shall
always have our voice under command. But whenever we transgress
these bounds, we give up the reins, and have no longer any management of it. It is a useful rule too, in order to be well heard, to cast our
eye on some of the most distant persons in the company, and to colnsider ourselves as reading to them. We naturally and mechanically
utter our words with such a degree of strength as to make ourselves bie
hleard by the person whom we address, provided he is within the reach
of our voice. As this is the case in conversation, it will hold also in
reading to others. But let us remember, that in reading, as well as in.onversation, it is possible to offend by speaking too loud. This extreme
hurts the ear, by making the voice come upon it in rumbling, indistinct
masses.
"By the habit of reading, when young, in a loud and vehement manner, the voice becomes fixed in a strained and unnatural key; and is
rendered incapable of that variety of elevation and depression which
constitutes the true harmony of utterance, anld affords ease to the reader,
and pleasure to the audience. This unnatural pitch of the voice, and
disagreeable monotony, are most observable min persons who were taught
to read in large rooms; who were accustomed to stand at too great a;
distance, when reading to their teachers; whose instructors were very
imperfect in their hearing; or who were taught by persons who considered loud expression as the chief requisite in forming a good reader.
These are circumstances which demanld the serious attention of every
one to whom the education of youth is committed.

So live, that'when thy summons comes to join
The innumerable caravan, that moves
To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take
His chamber in the silent halls of death,

By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.
The word verse properly means a turnincg, and for this reason eacth
line in poetry is a verse. The divisions of a poem, whether tlhey consist of' four, six, or any other number of verses or lines, are called
stanzas.  The pupil n-lust be careful not to pause at the end of a
stanza, unless the sense is comnpleted. The following are instances in
which, as the sense is not completed, the voice must not be suspended
at the end of the stanza.'766.

The bird that crests yon dew-bespangled tree,
Shakes his bright plumes, and trills his descant free,

Burns its red path, and cleaves a shrinking world;
All these are music to Religion's ear:Music, thy' hand awakes, for man to hear.

A vacant fancy, or a passing gale
Or nothing!'Tis a heavy, hollow ball,
Suspended on a slender, subtile hair,
And filled with storm winds, thunders, passions, all
Struggling within ir- furious tumult there.
Strange mystery! man's gentlest breath can shake it,
And the light zephyrs are enough to break it.

modulation of the voice, which, from its intilnate connection with tile
reading of poetry of' a solemn kinid, has been reserved ibr explanation
in this place. It is called the i\NorTONE, and consists of a degree of
sameness of sound, or. tone, in a nunmber of' successive words or syllables.
It is very seldom ti,',;ase that there is a perfect sameness to be observed in reading an\. sentence or part of a sentence. But very
little variety of tone, oi, in other words, a degree of' thie SIoNOTONF;, iS
to be used in reading either prose or verse, which contains elevated
descriptions, or emotions of solemnity, sublimlity, or reverence. This
mo'notone-should generally be a low tone of' tlhe voice. ThSllus, in addressing the Deity, in the following lines, a degree of the moniotone
is to be used.'70.
O Thou Eternal One! whose presence bright
All space doth occupy, all motion guide;
Unchanged through time's all devastatinr flight;

The monotone may with good effect be introduced in many of the sentences contained in the previous pages of this book, especially in Numbers 616
and 617, page 101. Asit is the design of the author, in these pages, to furnish
lessons,* rather than exercises, in reading, the extracts already introduced
will be sufficient to impress the principle contained in this lesson.
LESSON XXXVIII.
ANALYSIS;
The word ANALYSISt means the separation of the parts of rwhich a thsng
is composed.
Every sentence, whether it be a long or a short one, contains one prominent
idea, which, by a proper management of the voice, must be brought out inlto
clear and distinct notice. It sometimes happens, especiallv in very long seiltences, that the prlominent idea is interrupted or obscured by parentheses,
descriptions, explanatory remarks, or other expressious, which render it difficult for the reader to distinguish the Inost important part, and give it that
prominence which it deserves. Herein lies the greatest difficulty in the art
of reading. No rule can be given to aid the pupil in the discovery of the prominent ideas in his reading lessons. He must here be left to study and reflection. The information, however, that there are such prominent ideas in complex sentences, will lead him to endeavor to disco,er them; and the practice
which he has had in the use of emphasis, slur, expression, and other principles contained in the preceding lessons, will enable him to apply himself to the
study of such sentences, with the hope of distinguishing the parts which should
be brought into strong light, from those which require to be thrown into the
shade. To aid him in the study, a few examples are here introduced.
779.
The rivulet sends forth glad sounds, and tripping o'er its
bed of pebbly sands, or leaping down the rocks, seems with
continuous laughter to rejoice in its own being.

145
In this sentence, one principal idea is expressed, namely, that the
rivulet sends forth glad sounds, and seems to rejoice in its own being.
This idea must therefore be brought out prominently; while the expressions tripping o'er its bed of pebbly sapds, and leaping down the
rocks, are merely descriptions of the appeara.ce of the river, and need
not be so emphatically marked. The same remark must be made
with regard to the expression with continuous laughter, which is only
an explanation of the manner in which it rejoices. These expressions
may be slightly slurred.*
In reading the sentence, therefore, he will express it as follows, pronouncing the parts in Italic letters with less emphatic force than tile
prominent idea.
780.
The rivulet sends forth glad sounds, and tripping o'er its
bed of pebbly sands, or leaping down the rocks, seems with
continuous laughter to rejoice in its own being. t
In the following sentences, all the parts, except the prominent ideas,
are printed in Italic letters. The pupil will read them as directed

In the analysis of a sentence, with the view to read it correctly,
there are generally three things to be considered by the pupil; namely: First, What are the most prominent parts, or those which require
emphasis - Secondly, What parts are merely explanatory, and consequently are to be slurred or thrown into shade- Thirdly, What parts,
separated by explanatory, descriptive, or other circumstances, are inti.
mately connected with each other, and must have their intimate connection expressed by strong emphasis, or by slurring the parts which separate them.
The pupil may analyze the following sentences; that is to say, he
may marlk and read those parts or words only which are mlost prominent, and require strong emphasis. He may then mention what parts
are merely explanatory, &amp;c. And then he may point out those parts
which, though distant from the eye, are closely connected in sense.
Lastly, he may read each sentence as it stands, endeavoring to manage
the emphasis, slur, and expression, in the manner in which he has
heretofore been directed.*

149INTRODUCTION.'; DISTINCTNESS.
"In the next place, to being Nwell heard and clearly understood, distinctness of articulation contributes more than mere loudness of sound.
The quantity of sound necessary to fill even a large space is smaller
than is commonly imagined; and, with distinct articulation, a person
with a weak voice will make it reach further than the strongest voice
can reach without it. To this, therefore, every reader ought to pay great
attention. He must give every sound which he utters its due proportion; and make every syllable, and even every letter, in the word which
he pronounces, be heard distinctly: without slurring, whispering, or
suppressing, any of the pro.er sounds.
" An accurate knowledge of the simple, elementary sounds of the language, and a facility in expressing them, are so necessary to distinctness
of expression, that if the learner's attainments are, in this respect, imperfect, (and many there are in this situation,) it will be incumbent on
his teacher to carry him back to these primary articulations; and to
suspend hi" progress till he become nerfectly master of them. It will
be in vain to press him forward, with the hope of forming a good reader,
if he cannot comple.tely articulate every elementary sound of the lan
guage.
DUE DEGREE OF SLOWNESS.
"In order to express ourselves distinctly, moderation is requisite with
regard to the speed of pronouncing. Precipitancy of speech confounds
all articulation, and all meaning. It is scarcely necessary to observe,
that there may be also an extreme on the opposite side.. It is obvious
that a lifeless, drawlin,  manner of reading, which allows the minds of
the hearers to be always outrunning the speaker, must render every
such performance insipid and fatiguing. But the extreme of reading
too fast is much more common; and requires the more to be guarded
against, because, when it has grown into a habit, few errors are more
difficult to be corrected. To pronounce -with a proper degree of slowness, and with full and clear articulation, is necessary to be studied by
all, who wish to become good readers; and it cannot be too much
recommended to them. Such a pronunciation gives weight and dignity
to the subject. It is a great assistance to the voice, by the pauses and
rests which it allows the reader more easily to make: and it enables the
reader to swell all his sounds. both with more force and more harmony.
" PROPRIETY OF PRONUNCIATION.
"After the fundamental attentions o the pitch and management of
the voice, to distinct articulation, an.d to a proper degree of slorwness of
speech, what the young reader must, in the next place, study, is propriety of pronunciation; or, giving to ever"r word which he utters that
sound which the best usage of the language.ppropriates to it; in opposition to broad, vulgar, or provincial pronunciation. This is requisite
both for reading injelligibly, and for reading with correctness and ease.
Instructions concerning this article may be best given by the living
teacher. But there is one observation, which it may not be improper
here to m1ake. In the English language, every word which consists of
more syllables than one has one accented syllable. The accents rest
sometimes on the vowel, sometimes on the consonant.'The genius of
the language requires the voice to mark that syllable by a stronger
percussion, and to pass inmore slightly over the rest. Now, after we have

That patient merit of the unworthy takes,

To grunt and sweat under a weary life;
But that the dread of something after death,The undiscovered country, from whose bourn

sea of troubles;" but this expression is a manifest violation of all rhetorical
rule. [See Progressive Exercises in English Composition, Lesson 25, p. 49.]

LESSON XXXIX.
BLENDING OF WORDS PRODUCED BY AU.
CENTED FO RCE.
Under the head of accented force, Mr. Walker, in his
Rhetorical Grammar, has noticed the peculiar manner in
which words, or parts of different words, are son-etimes
blended, so as to appear in pronunciation like a single word.
Thus the sentence, "Censure is the tax a man pays to the
public for being eminent," when it is read with a proper
regard to the measure of speech, accenit, emphasis, &amp;c., will
appear as if it were written thus:801.
Censure        isthetax      amanpays        tothepublic

It will be needless to insert any extracts for the exercise
of the pupil in this principle. The teacher will select from
any part of the book such sentences for him to read as will
enable him readily to perceive the difference between accented tords and accented syllables.

piece. On this subject much has been said in the previous lessons of this
book. It remains for the pupil, who has gone through these lessons in
course, to endeavor to apply the instructions given him, in all the various
kinds of reading in which he may be exercised. If he has a correct ear,
he will not fail to observe that both the rising and falling inflections of the
voice admit of different degrees. These are technically described in Drn
Barber's Grammar of Elocution, and more fully developed in the respective works of Dr. Rush and Mr. Steele, to which reference has already
been made. The subject is also particularly noticed in Walker's Rhetorical Grammar. In these exercises, it is deemed inexpedient to present any
intricate views of the subject; but, after the statement of a principle, to
leave the pupil to the guidance of Nature. [See preface and tille-page.]
LESSON XL.
IMPROVEMENT OF THE VOICE.
The voice, like all the other faculties of the body or the mind, is
susceptible of great improvement; and under proper management,
one that is naturally feeble may be rendered more effective than another, which is endowed with great strength. The two most important
requisites in a good voice are CLEARNESS and STRENGTH. In tlhe
twenty-fifth lesson of this book, some exercises are presented with the
desiga to accustom the pupil to distinct articulation. If he has passed
over that lesson with little attention, he is advised to return to it;
and, by persevering practice, acquire a facility in the pronunciation of
those sounds which are represented by the combination of the consonants alone.  In connection with this exercise, he is advised to
practise the vowel sounds, in the manner which shall presently be
pointed out.
The Sounds of the Vowels are as follows:a as heard in the word  fate     o   as heard in the wvcrd  m-:ve

These sounds of the vowels and consonants should be uttered in
various ways.
1st. Let the pupil practise what iscalled exploding* them; that is,
let him pronounce each of them  in a quick, sudden manner, like the
report of a pistol.
2d. Let him prolong the same sounds, with care, to preserve their
purity.
3d. Let him practise both the abrupt and the prolonged sounds of
each, in conjunction with the consonants, and the combination of the
consonants presented in Lesson 25.
4th. Let him practise all the above-mentioned sounds, in each of the
* " This practice," says Dr. Barber, " will be found a more effectual method
than any other of obtaining a strong and powerful voice -of strengthening
such voices as are feeble, and of giving fulness and strength of tone to all in
proportion to their natural capacities.'  He adds, immediately after, "The
student has not obtained that use of his voice which it is the object of this
table to teach him, until every sound it contains can be uttered with the suddenness of the report' of fire-aims, without any apparenlt effort preceding the
exlIlosion, with a very hligh degree of percussive force, and with strength and
fulness of tone." Again, he says in another place, " We know that persons
with feeble voices have been rendered capable of speaking forcibly and implessively in public, by a perseverance in the practice here recommended."
- Gram. of Elocution, p. 30.- Dr. Barber's work cannot be too highly recomnended to all who would pursue this subject scientifically. In this lesson the
author has departed in some respects from the arrangement of the vowel
sounds, as presented in the tables of Dr. Barber, and adopted that which is
contained ini the spelling books commonly used. These lessons are designed
principally as an introduction to the subject, and not as a full treatis,e. They
who have leisure for a more extended view, are referred to Dr. Barber's
Grammar, and to the very able, scientific, and more voluminous work to
which reference has been already made - Dr. Rush on " The Philosophy of the
Human Voice." Mr. Steele's work, entitled "Prcsodia Rationalis," is likerwise well worthy the attention of those who would acquire a thorough knowledge of the powvers and peculiarities of the human voice154                 INTRODUCTORY LESSONS.
different pitches or keys of the voico, mentioned in Lesson 27, p. 95;
and likewise in a whisper. *
Among the consonants there are two which require particular attention, nanlely, 1 and r; and if there are any letters, the correct and distinct articulation of which distinguish a good from a bad pronunciation, they are these two.
It is recommended that the pupil be thoroughly exercised in the
pronunciation of words which contain these letters especially the r.
This letter has two sounds, called the smooth and the vibrant. The
vibrant r is pronounced by what is frequently called rolling the tongue.
This sound, when properly made, is one which is highly pleasing to
the ear; but when too much prolonged, it becomes harsh and offensive,
and is suited only for a rough or energetic utterance. Dr. Rush says
that it " will be agreeable when it consists of one, or at most two or
three strokes and rebounds of the tongue."
The smooth r is that sound which is heard in the words bard, card,
hard. In such words it savors of affectation or provincialism to substitute the vibrant r.

At*er the pupil has sufficiently practised the utterance of the various
sounds of vowels and consonants, both separately and in combination,
it is recommended that lie daily exercise himself in reading or speaking with all his powers of loudness and force. This habit will contribute much to the acquisition of strength of voice. But above all,
let him remember that distinctness of articulation is of' the utmost importance in utterance; and that a weak voice with this quality can
be heard and understood at a much greater distance than a strong one
wittiout it.
Again; the pupil will find much benefit in the practice of swelling
and dirninishing the power of his voice. For this purpose, let him begin a long sentence softly, slowly, and in a low tone, and gradually
swell his voice in pitch, power, and rapidity, till he has attained the
utmost extent of those qualities of which it is susceptible; and then
let it descend and fade away by degrees, till it becomes almost imperceptible.
And, lastly, reading with rapidity (simply as an exercise of the voice)
will contribute much to the ease and power of utterance. But the
pupil niust never allow his words to pass from his mouth indistinctly.
How rapidly soever he may read, as an exercise, he must be careful
to give each syllable and each letter its distinct appropriate sound.
To these directions for the improvement of the voice may be added
the caution to open the mouth, when speaking, in such a manner as to
afford an easy passage for the sound. Many persons have contracted
a habit of reading and speaking with the lips compressed in such a
manner as entirely to alter the tone of the voice and destroy its distinctness of utterance. This caution must be particularly regarded by
all who aim at excellence in the ART OF READING.
Dr. Rush has described four different kinds of voice; namely, the
NATURAL, the FALSETTE, the WHISPERING, and the OROTUND, which
he thus describes:
The NATURAL voICE is that which we employ in ordinary speaking.
The FALSETTE is that peculiar voice in which the higher degrees
of pitch are made, after the natural voice breaks, or outruns its power.
The cry, scream, yell, and all shrillness, are various modes of the
falsette.156           INTRODUCTORY LESSONS IN READING.
The WHISPERING voice needs no description; but it may be observed that some persons are endowed with such clearness and distinctness in this kind of voice, that they can make themselves heard
at a great distance when speaking in this way.
By the OROTUND voice is meant that natural or improved manner
of uttering the elements, which exhibits them with a fulness, clearness,
strength, smoothness, and a ringing or musical quality, rarely heard in
ordinary speech; but which is never found in its highest excellence, except through long and careful cultivation.
In conclusion, it may be stated, that all who aim at excellence as
Readers and Speakers, should en'deavor to attain this last-described
quality 6f voice.* For their encouragement it may be added, that it
has frequently been acquired by those whose voices were naturally
weak and ineffective, and that no one, therefore, should despair of
the attainment, -for WHAT MAN HAS DONE, MAN CAN DO.
* Among the refinements in pronunciation, at which the careful student of
the art of rhetorical reading should aim, may be particularly meitioned the
legitimate sounds of e and i, in such words as earth, mercy, mi7rthi, birth, &amp;c.,
which are too commonly pronouiiced as if they were spelt urth, nmurcy, murth,
burth. In the word merit, the e always receives its proper sound. The same
syllable mer, common both to the words merit and mercy, should have the
same pronunciation in both words; and the reader, by carefully noticing thns
fact, will find little difficulty in attaining the correct pronunciation of the e, in
the words to which reference has been made. The proper sound of the i likewise, in the words above mentioned, approaches nearer to the sound of siort e
than to that of u.EXERCISES IN RHETORICAL READING

The Structure of Animals.
TiiosE who were skilful in anatomy among the ancients
concluded, from the outward and inward make of a human
body, that it was the work of a being transcendently wise
and powerful. As the world grew more enlightened in
5 this art, their discoveries gave them fresh opportunities of
admiring the conduct of Providence in the formation of a
human body. Galen was converted by his dissections,
and could not but own a Supreme Being upon a survey of
his handiwork.
10   There were, indeed, many parts of which the old anatomists did not know the certain use; but as they saw that
most of those which they examined were adapted with
admirable art to their several functions, they did not question that those whose uses they could not determine were
15 contrived with the same wisdom for respective ends and
purposes. Since the circulation of the blood has been
found out, and many other great discoveries have been
made by our modern anatomists, we see new wonders in
the human frame, and discern several important uses for
20 those parts, which uses the ancients knew nothing of.
In short, the body of man is such a subject as stands
the utmost test of examination. Though it appears formed
with the nicest wisdom upon the most superficial survey
of it, it still mends upon the search, and produces our sur25 prise and amazement in proportion as we pry into it.
What I have here said of a human body may be applied
to the body of every animal which has been the subject
of anatomical observations.
The body of an animal is an object adequate to our
30 senses. It is a particular system of Providence, that lies
in a narrow compass. The eye is able to command it,
and by successive inquiries can search into all its parts.
14Could the body of the whole earth, or indeed the whole
universe, be thus submitted to the examination of our
senses, were it not too big and disproportioned for our
inquiries, too unwieldy for the- management of the eye
5 and hand, there is no question but it would appear to us
as curious and well contrived a frame as that of a human
body. We should see the same concatenation and subserviency, the same necessity and usefulness, the same beauty
and harmony in all and every of its parts, as what we
10 discover in the body of every single animal.
The more extended our reason is, and the more able to
grapple with immense objects, the greater still are those
discoveries which it makes of wisdom and providence in
the works of the creation. A Sir Isaac Newton, who
15 stands up as a miracle of the present age, can look through
a whole planetary system; consider it in its weight, number and measure; and draw from it as many demonstrations of infinite power and wisdom as a more confined
understanding is able to deduce from the system of a
20 human body.
But to return to our speculative anatomy. I shall here
consider the fabric and texture of the body of animals in
one particular view, which, in my opinion, shows the hand
of a thinlcing and all-wise Being in their formation, with
25 the evidence of a thousand demonstrations. I think we may
lay this down as an incontested principle, that chance never
acts in a perpetual uniformity and consistence with itself.
If one should always fling the same number with ten
thousand dice, or see every throw just five times less, or
30 five times more in number than the throw which immediately preceded it, who would not imagine there was some
invisible power which directed the cast?
This is the proceeding which we find in the operations
of nature. Every kind of animal is diversified by differ35 ent magnitudes, each of which gives rise to a different
species. Let a man trace the dog or lion kind, and he
will observe how many of the works of nature are published, if I may use the expression, in a variety of editions.
If we look into the reptile world, or into those different
40 kinds of animals that fill the element of water, we meet
with.he same repetitions among several species, that differ very little from one another but in size and bulk.
You find the same creature that is drawn at large copied
out in several proportions, and endirg in miniature.
[EX. I.
158
PARKElt S EXERCISES 1NIt would be tedious to produce instances of this regular
conduct in Providence, as it would be superfluous to those
who are versed in the natural history of animals. The
magnificent harmony of the universe is such that we may
5 observe innumerable divisions running upon the same
ground. I might also extend this speculation to the dead
parts of nature, in which we may find matter disposed
into many similar systems, as well in our survey of stars
and planets, as of stones, vegetables, and other sublunary
10 parts of the creation.
In a word, Providence has shown the richness of its
goodness and wisdom, not only in the production of
many original species, but in the multiplicity of descants
which it has made on every original species in particular.
15 But to pursue this thought still further. Every living
creature, considered in itself, has many very complicated
parts, that are exact copies of some other parts which it
possesses, which are complicated in the same manner.
One eye would have been sufficient for the subsistence
20 and preservation of an animal; but in order to better his
condition, we see another placed with a mathematical
exactness in the same most advantageous situation, and in
every particular of the same size and texture. Is it possible for chance to be thus delicate and uniform in her oper25 ations? Should a million of dice turn up twice together
the same number, the wonder would be nothing in comparison with this.
But when we see this similitude and resemblance in the
arm, the hand, the fingers; when we see %one half of the
30 body entirely correspond with the othet in all those minute strokes, without which a man might have very well
subsisted; nay, when we often see a single part repeated
a hundred times in the same body, notwithstanding it
consists of the most intricate weaving of numberless fibres,
35 and these parts differing still in magnitude, as the convenience of their particular situation requires; sure a man
must have a strange cast of understanding who does not
discover the finger of God in so wonderful a work.
These duplicates in those parts of the body, without
40 whiqh a nlan might have very well subsisted, though not
so well as with them, are a plain demonstration of an allwise Contriver; as those more numerous copyings, which
are found among the vessels of the same body, are evident
demonstrations that they could not be the work of chance.

course. ~Many persons err in this respect.  When they read to others
and with solemnity, they pronounce the syllables in a different manner
from what they do at other times. They dwell upon them and protract
them; they multiply accents on the same word, from a mistaken notion,
that it gives gravity and importance to their subject, and adds to the
energy of their delivery. Whereas this is one of the greatest faults that
can be committed in pronunciation: it makes what is called a pompous
or mouthing manner, and gives an artificial, affected air to reading, which
detracts greatly both from its agreeableness and its impression.
"Sheridan and Walker have published dictionaries for ascertaining
the true and best pronunciation of the words of our language. By
attentively consulting them, particularly'Walker's Pronouncing Dictionary,' the young reader xwill be much assisted in his endeavors to
attain a correct pronunciation of the words belonging to the English

~' EMIPHASIS.
"By emphasis is meant a stronger and fuller sound of voice, by
which we distinguish some word, or words, on which we design to lay
particular stress, and to show how they affect the rest of the sentence.
Sometimes the emphatic words must be distinguished by a particular
tone of voice, as well as by a particular stress. On the right management of the emphasis depends the life of pronunciation. If no emphasis
be placed on any words, not only is discourse rendered heavy,and lifeless, but the meaning is often left ambiguous.   If the emphasis be
placed wrong, we pervert and confound the meaning wholly. -

The superior emphasis determines the meaning of a sentence, with reference to something said before, presupposed by the author as genera.
knowledge, or removes an anmbibuity, where a passage may have more
senses than one. The inferior emphasis enforces, graces, and enlivens,
but does not fix, the meaning of any passage.  The words to which this
latter emphasis is given are, in general, such as seem the most important in the sentence, or, on other accounts, to merit this distinction. The
following passage will serve to exemplify the superior emphasis.'Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit
Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
Brought death into the world, and all our woe,' &amp;c.
Sing,heavenly Muse!'
" Supposing that originally other beings besides men had disobeyed
the coimmands of the Almighty, and that the circumstance were well
klnown to us, there would fall an emphasis upon the word man's in the
first line; and hence it would read thus:'Of man's first disobedience, and the f~ruit,' &amp;c.
"But if it were a notorious truth, that manklind had transgressed in

no work which professes to supply his place, so far as pronurciation alone is concerned.
As a guide to the si,n?Lification of words, and the tracing of their etymology, the Dictionary of Dr. Webster is of the highest authority, and has received the approbation of
critics in the mother country, as Well as in this. Dr. Webster has spent a long life in
the investigation of authorities, and probably ino one individual has labored longer or
with equal success in this department o' literalure
16This argument receives additional strength, if we apply
it to every animal and insect within our knowledge,
as well as to those numberless living creatures that are
objects too minute for a human eye; and if we consider
5 how the several species in this whole world of life resemble one another, in very many particulars, so far as is convenient for their respective states of existence, it is much
more probable that a hundred million of dice should be
casually thrown a hundred million of times in the same
10 number, than that the body of any single animal should
be produced by the fortuitous concourse of matter: And
that the like chance should arise in innumerable instances,
requires a degree of credulity that is not under the direction of common sense.-Spectator.

EXERCISE III.
Scale of Beings.
THOUGH there is a great deal of pleasure in contemplating the material world, - by which I mean that system of
bodies into which nature has so curiously wrought the
14*
EX. II.]
161mass of dead matter, with the several relations that those
bodies bear to one another, -there is still, mrethinks, something more wonderful and surprising, in contemplations
on the world of life; by which I understand, all those
5  animals with which every part of the universe is furnished. The rnmaterial world is only the shell of the universe; the world of life are its inhabitants.
If we consider those parts of the material world which
lie the nearest to us, and are therefore subject to our
10 observations and inquiries, it is amazing to consider the
infinity of animals with which they are stocked. Every
part of matter is peopled; every green leaf swarms with
inhabitants. There is scarcely a single humor in the
body of a man, or of any other animal, in which our
15 glasses do not discover myriads of living creatures.
We find even in the most solid bodies, as in marbie
itself,- innumerable cells and cavities, which are crowded
with imperceptible inhabitants, too little for the naked eye
to discover. On the other hand, if we look into the more
20 bulky parts of nature, we see the seas, lakes, and rivers,
teeming with numberless kinds of living creatures. We
find every mountain and marsh, wilderness and wood,
plentifully stocked with birds and beasts; and every part
of matter affording proper necessaries and conveniences
25 for the livelihood of multitudes which inhabit it.
The author of "The Plurality of Worlds" draws a
very good argument from this consideration, for the peopling of every planet; as indeed it seems very probable,
from the analogy of reason, that if no part of matter,
30 with which we are acquainted, lies waste and useless,
those greater bodies, which are at such a distance from
us, are not desert and unpeopled; but, rather, that they
are furnished with beings adapted to their respective situations
35   Existence is a blessing to those beings'only which are
endowed with perception; and is in a manner thrown
away upon dead matter, any further than as it is subservient to beings which are conscious of their existence.
Accordingly we find, from the bodies which lie under our
40 observation, that matter is only made as the basis and
support of animals, arid that there is no more of the one
than vwhat is necessary for the existence of the other.
Infinite Goodness is of so communicative a nattire, that
it seems to delight in confbrring existence upon every de162
PARKER IS EXERCISES IN
[Ex. III.gree of perceptive being. As this is a speculation, vwhich
I have often pursued with great pleasure to mvself, I shall
enlarge further upon it, by considering that. part of the
scale of beings which comes within our knowledge.
5    There are some living creatures which are raised but
just above dead matter. To mention only that species of
shell-fish which is formed inll the fashion of a cone, that
grows to the surface of several rocks, and immediately
dies on being severed from the place where it grew.
10 There are many other creatures but one remove from
these, which have no other sense than that of feeling and
taste. Others have still an additional one of hearing;
others of smell; and others of sight.
It is wonderful to observe by what a gradual progress
15 the world of life advances, through a prodigious variety
of species, before a creature is formed that is complete in
all its senses; and even among these, there is such a different degree of perfection, in the sense which one animal
enjoys beyond what appears in another, that though the
20 sense in different animals is distinguished by the same
common denomination, it seems almost of a different
nature.
If, after this, we look into the several inward perfections
of cunning and. sagacity, or what we generally call instinct,
25 we find them rising, after the same manner, imperceptibly
one above another; and receiving additional improvements, according to the species in which they are implanted.- This progress in nature is so very gradual, that
the most perfect of an inferior species comes very near
30 to the most imperfect of that which is immediately above it.
The exuberant and overflowing goodness of the Supreme Being, whose mercy extends to all his works, is
plainly seen, as I have before hinted, in his having made
so very little matter, at least what falls within our knowl35 edge, that does not swarm with life. Nor is his goodness
less seen in the diversity, than in the multitude of living
creatures. Had he made but one species of animals,
none of the rest would have enjoyed the happiness of' existence he has, therefore, specified, in his creation,
40 every degree of life, every capacitv of being.
The whole chasm of nature, from a plant to a man, is
filled up with divers kinds of creatures, rising one after
another, by an ascent so gentle and easy that the little
transitions and deviations fromn one species to another are
163.EX. III.]
RHETORICAL READING.PARKER'S EXERCISES IN
almost insensible.  This intermediate space is so well
husbanded and managed, that there is scarcely a degree
of perception which does not appear in some one part of
the world of life. Is the goodness or the wisdom of the
5  Divine Being more manifested in this his proceeding?
There is a consequence, besides those I have already
mentioned, which seems very naturally deducible from fhe
foregoing considerations. If the scale of being rises by
so regular a progress so high as man, we may, by parity
10 of reason, suppose, that it still proceeds gradually through
those beings which are of a superior nature to him; since
there is infinitely greater space and room for different degrees of perfection, between the Supreme Being and man,
than between man and the most despicable insect.
15   In this great system of being, there is no creature so
wonderful in its nature, and which so much deserves our
particular attention, as man; who fills up the middle
space between the animal and the intellectual nature, the
visible and the invisible world; and who is that link in
20 the chain of being which forms the connection between
both. So that he, who, in one respect, is associated with
angels and archangels, and may look upon a being of infinite perfection as his father, and the highest order of
spirits as his brethren, may, in another respect, say to
25 "corruption, thou art my father," and to the worm, "thou
art my mother and my sister."- Addison.

by those strokes of vivacity which give instant though not
permanent pleasure.
What they want, however, in gayety they make up in
politeness. You smile at hearing me praise the English
5  for their politeness; you, who have heard very different
accounts from the missionaries at Pekin, who have seen
such a different behavior in their merchants and seamen at
home. Bit I must still repeat it, the English seem more
polite than any of their neighbors; their great art in this
10 respect lies in endeavoring, while they oblige, to lessen
the force of the favor. Other countries are fond of obliging a stranger, but seem desirous that he should be sensible of the obligation. The English confer their kindness
with an appearance of indifference, and give away benefits
15 with an air as if they despised them.
Walking, a few days ago, between an Englishman and
a Frenchman, into the suburbs of the city, we were overtaken by a heavy shower of rain. I was unprepared, but
they had each large coats, which efended them from
20 what seemed to me a perfect inundation. The Englishman, seeing me shrink from the weather, accosted me
thus: " Psha, man, 3what dost shrink at? Here, take this
coat; I don't want it; I find it no way useful to me; I
had as lief be without it."
25   The Frenchman began to show his politeness in turn.
"My dear friend," cries he, "why won't you oblige me
by making use of my coat? you see how well it defends
me from the rain. I should not choose to part with it to
others, but to such a friend as you I could even part with
30 my skin to do him service."

The Amiable Character of the Patriarch Joseph.
35   No human character exhibited in the records of Scripture is more remarkable and instructive than that of the
patriarch Joseph. He is one whom we behold tried in all
the vicissitudes of fortune; from the condition of a slave,
EX. VII3]
167rising to be ruler of the land of Egypt; and in every station acquiring, by his virtue and wisdom, favor with God
and man. When overseer of Potiphar's house, his fidelity
was proved by strong temptations, which he honorably
5 resisted.
When thrown into prison by the artifices of a false
woman, his integrity and prudence soon rendered him
conspicuous, even in that dark mansion. When called
into the presence of Pharaoh, the wise and extensive plan
10 which he formed for saving the kingdom from the miseries
of impending famine, justly raised him to a high station,
wherein his abilities were eminently displayed in the public service.
But in his whole history there is no circumstance so
15 striking and interesting as his behavior to his brethren
who had sold him into slavery. The moment in which
he made himself known to them was the most critical
one of his life, and the most decisive of his character. It
is such as rarely occurs in the course of human events,
20 and is calculated to draw the highest attention of all who
are endowed with any degree of sensibility of heart.
From the whole tenor of the narration, it appears, that
though Joseph, upon the arrival of his brethren in Egypt,
made himself strange to them, yet, from the beginning, he
25 intended to discover himself; and studied so to conduct
the discovery as might render the surprise of joy complete. For this end, by affected severity, he took measures
for bringing down into Egypt all his father's children.
They were now arrived there; and Benjamin among
30 the rest, who was his younger brother by the same mother,
and was particularly beloved by Joseph. Him he threatened to detain; and seemed willing to allow the rest to
depart. This incident renewed their distress. They all
knew their father's extreme anxiety about the safety of
35 Benjamin, and with what difficulty he had yielded to his
undertaking this journey.
Should he be prevented from. returning, they dreaded
that grief would overpower the old man's spirits, and prove
fatal to his life. Judah, therefore, who had particularly
40 urged the necessity of Benjamin's accompanying his brothers, and had solemnly pledged himself to their father for
his safe return, craved, upon this occasion, an audience of
the governor, and gave him a full aczount of the circumstances of Jacob's family.
168
PARK(ER IS EXERCISES IN
[EX. vn.Nothing can be more interesting and pathetic than this
discourse of Judah. Little knowing to whom he spoke,
he paints, in all the colors of simple and natural eloquence,
the distressed situation of the aged patriarch, hastening to
6  the close of life; long afflicted for the loss of a favorite
son, whom he supposed to have been torn in pieces by a
beast of prey; laboring now under anxious concern about
his youngest son, the child of his old age, who alone was
left alive of his mother, and whom nothing but the calam10 ities of severe famine could have moved a tender father to
send from home, and expose to the dangers of a foreign
land.
"If we bring him not back with us, we shall bring down
the gray hairs of thy servant, our father, with sorrow to
15 the grave. I pray thee therefore let thy servant abide,
instead of the young man, a bondman to our lord. For
how shall 1 go up to my father, and Benjamin not with
me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father."
Upon this relation, Joseph could no longer restrain him20 self. The tender ideas of his father, and his,father's
house, of his ancient home, his country, and his kindred,
of the distress of his family, and his own exaltation, all
rushed too strongly upon his mind to bear any-further concealment. " He cried, Cause every man to go out from
25 me; and he wept aloud."
The tears which he shed were not the tears of grief.
They were the burst of affection. They were the effusions of a heart overflowing with all the tender sensibilities of nature. Formerly he had been moved in the same
30 manner when he first saw his brethren before him. " His
bowels yearned upon them; he sought for a place where
to weep. He went into his chamber; and then washed
his face and returned to them."
At that period, his generous plans were not completed.
35 But now, when there was no further occasion for constraining himself, he gave free vent to the strong emotions of
his heart. The first minister to the king of Egypt was
not ashamed to show that he felt as a man and a brother.
" He wept aloud; and the Egyptians and the house of
{0 Pharaoh heard him."
The first words which his swelling heart allowed him
to pronounce are the imost suitable to such an affecting
situation that were ever uttered -"I am Joseph; doth
my father yet live?" What could he, what ought he, in

of learning to read, in the best manner it is.now taught, very few coiuld

any degree of it; and others do not scruple to carry it far beyond anything to be found in common discourse; and even sometimes throw it
upon words so very trifling in themselves, that it is evidently done with
no other view than to give a greater variety to the modulation.*  Notwithstanding this diversity of practice, there are certainly proper boundaries, within which this emphasis must be restrained, in order to make it
meet the approbation of sound judgment and correct taste. It will,

The Rainbow.
THE evening was glorious, and light through the trees
Played in sunshine, the rain-drops, the birds, and the breeze;
The landscape, outstretching, in loveliness lay
On the lap of the year, in the beauty of Mav.
25   For the bright queen of spring, as she passed down the
vale,
Left her robe on the trees. and her breath on the gale;
And the smile of her promise gave joy to the hours,
And fresh in her footsteps sprang herbage and flowers.
30   The skies, like a banner in sunset unrolled,
O'er the west threw their splendor of azure and gold;
But one cloud at a distance rose dense, and increased,'Till its margin of black touched the zenith and east.
We gazed on these scenes, while around us they glowed,
35 When a vision of beauty appeared on the cloud;'T was not like the sun, as at mid-day we view,
Nor the moon, that rolls lightly through starlight and blue.
170
[EX. VIL.Like a spirit it came in the van of a stormn,
And the eye and the heart hailed its beautiful form;
For it looked not severe, like an angel of wrath,
But its garments of brightness illumed its dark path.
5    In the hues of its grandeur sublimely it stood,
O'er the river, the village, the field, and the wood;
And river, field, village, and woodland grew bright,
As conscious they felt and afforded delight.'T was the bow of Omnipotence, bent in his hand
10 Whose grasp at creation the universe spanned;'T was the presence of God, in a symbol sublime,
His vow from the flood to the exit of time;
Not dreadful as when in a whirlwind he pleads,
When storms are his chariot, and lightning his steeds;
15 The black cloud of vengeance his banner unfurled,
And thunder his voice to a guilt-stricken world;
In the breath of his presence when thousands expire,
And seas boil with fury, and rocks burn with fire,
And the sword and the plague-spot with death strew the
20       plain,
And vultures and wolves are the graves of the slain.
Not such was that rainbow, that beautiful one!
Whose arch was refraction, its key-stone- the sun;
A pavilion it seemed, with a deity graced,
25 And justice and mercy met there and embraced.
A while, and it sweetly bent over the gloom,
Like love o'er a death-couch, or hope o'er the tomb;
Then left the dark scene, whence it slowly retired,
As love had just vanished, or hope had expired.
30   I gazed not alone on that source of my song,
To all who beheld it these verses belong;
Its presence to all was the path of the Lord!
Each full heart expanded, grew warm and adored.
Like a visit, the converse of friends, or a day,
35 That bow from my sight passed forever away;
Like that visit, that converse, that day, to my heart,
That bow from remembrance cail never depart.'T is a picture in memory, distinctly defined,
With the strong and imperishing colors of mind:

Beheld on that cloud, and transcribed on my soul.

EXERCISE IX.
On the Immortality of the Soul.
I WAS yesterday walking alone, in one of my friends'
woods, and lost myself in it very agreeably, as 1 was running over, in my mind, the several arguments that estab.
lish this great point,- which is the basis of morality, and
b  the source of all the pleasing hopes and secret joys, that
can arise in the heart of a reasonable creature? I considered those several proofs drawn,
First, from the nature of the soul itself, and particularly
its immateriality; which, though not absolutely necessary
10 to the eternity of its duration, has, I think, been evinced
to almost a demonstration.
Secondly, from its passions and sentiments; as, particularly, from its love of existence, its horror of annihilation,
and its hopes of immortality; with that secret satisfaction
15 which it finds in the practice of virtue, and that uneasiness which follows upon the commission of vice.
Thirdly, from the nature of the Supreme Being, whose
justice, goodness, wisdom, and veracity, are all concerned
in this point.
20   But among these, and other excellent arguments for
the immortality of the soul, there is one drawn froin the
perpetual progress of the soul to' its perfection, without a
possibility of ever arriving at, it; which is a hint that I do
not remember to have seen opened and improved by others
25 who have written on this subject, though it seems to mle
to carry a very great weight with it.
How can it enter into the thoughts of man, that the
soul, which is capable of immense perfections, and of receiving new improvements to all eternity, shall fall away
30 into nothing almost as soon as it is created? Are such
abilities made for no purpose? A brute arrives at a point
of perfection that he can never pass; in a few years he
has all the endowments he is capable of; and were he to
live ten thousand more, would be the samne thing he is at
35 present.
Were a human soul thus at a stand in her accomplishments, - were her faculties to be full blown, and incapable
of further enlargements, --I could imagine she might fall
away insensibly, and drop at once into a state of annihila40 tion. But can we believe a thinking being, that is in a
perpetual progress of improvement, and traveling on from
172
[EX. IX.perfection to perfection, after having just looked abroad
into the works of her Creator, and rnade a few discoveries
of his infinite goodness, wisdom, and power, must perish
at her first setting out, and in the very beginning of her
5  inquiries?
Man, considered only in his present state, seems sent
into the world merely to propagate his kind. He provides
himnself with a successor, and immediately quits his post
to make room for him. He does not seem born to enjoy
10 life, but to deliver it down to others. This is not surprising to consider in animals, which are formed for our use,
and which can finish their business in a short life.
The silk-worm, after having spun her task, lays her
eggs and dies. But a man cannot take in his full meas15 ure of knowledge, has not time to subdue his passions,
establish his soul in virtue, and come to. the perfection of
his nature, before he is hurried off the stage. Would an
infinitely wise Being make such glorious creatures for so
mean a purpose? Can he delight in the production of
20 such abortive intelligences, such short-lived reasonable beings? Would he give us talents that are not to be exerted? capacities that are never to be gratified?
How can we find that wisdom which shines through all
his works, in the formation of man, without looking on
25 this world as only a nursery for the next; and without
believing that the several generations of rational creatures,
which rise up and disappear in such quick successions,
are only to receive their first rudiments of existence here,
and afterwards to be transplanted into a more friendly
30 climate, where they may spread and flourish to all eternity?
There is not, in my opinion, a more pleasing and triumphant consideration in religion, than this of the perpetual progress which the soul makes towards the perfection
of its nature, without ever arriving at a period in it. To
35 look upon the soul as going on from strength to strength;
to consider that she is to shine forever with inew accessions
of glory, and brighten to all eternity; that she will be
still adding virtue to virtue, and knowledge to knowledge;
carries in it something wonderfully agreeable to that am40 bition which is natural to the mind of man. Nay, it
must be a prospect pleasing to God himself, to see his creation forever beautifying in his eyes, and drawing nearer
to him, by greater degrees of resemblance.
Methinks this single consideration of the progress of a
15*

1?73PARKER'S EXERCISES IN
finite spirit to perfection will be sufficient to extinguish all
envy in inferior natures, and all contempt in superior.
That cherub, which now appears as a god to a human
soul, knows very well that the period will come about in
5  eternity when the human soul shall be as perfect as he
himself now is; nay, when she shall look down upon that
degree of perfection as much as she now falls short of it.
It is true, the higher nature still advances, and by that
means preserves his distance and superiority in the scale
10 of being; yet he knows that, how high soever the station
is of which he stands possessed at present, the inferior
nature will, at length, mount up to it, and shine forth in
the same degree of glory.
With what astonishment and veneration may we look
15 into our own souls, where there are such hidden stores of
virtue and knowledge, such inexhausted sources of perfection! We know not yet what we shall be; nor will it ever
enter into the heart of man to conceive the glory that will
be always in reserve for him.
20   The soul, considered with its Creator, is like one of
those mathematical lines that may draw nearer to another
for all eternity, without a possibility of touching it: and
can there be a thought so transporting, as to consider ourselves in these perpetual approaches to Him who is the
25 standard not only of perfection, but of happiness!

Sabbath Exercises.
MANY Christians who feel deeply the importance of
spending the Sabbath in a proper manner, find, notwith175
EX. Xi.]
RHETORICAL READING.PARKER'S EXERCISES IN
standing all their endeavors, that the sacred hours do at
times pass heavily along. Now the Sabbath should be
not only the Christian's most profitable, but most happy
day. I once knew a young Christian who resolved that
5  he would pass the whole day in prayer; but very soon he
became exhausted and weary. He, however, persevered
through the whole day, with the exception of a few necessary interruptions; and when night came, he felt a deadness and exhaustion of feeling which he unhappily mis10 took for spiritual desertion. No human mind can, in
ordinary cases, sustain such long and intense application
to one subject; there must be variety, to give cheerfulness
and to invigorate. Often a conscientious young Christian
takes his Bible, resolving to spend the Sabbath in reading
15 the Bible and in prayer. He perhaps passes an hour or
two in this way very pleasantly, and then he feels tired;
he tries to rouse his feelings, and bitterly condemns himself for unavoidable languor. I have known persons to be
greatly disquieted and distrustful of their Christian char20 acter, because they could not pass the whole of the Sabbath pleasantly in uninterrupted reading of the Bible or in
continual prayer.
There is a wide difference between spiritual desertion
and mental exhaustion. To avoid this mental exhaustion,
25 and to keep the spirits animated and cheerful, much variety of pursuit is necessary. Who would be willing to go
to church, and have the whole time occupied with a sermon, or a prayer, or a hymn? How few are there who
can, with pleasure and profit, listen -to a sermon of one
30 hour's length! There must be a diversity of exercises to
make public worship agreeable, and there must be diversity to give pleasure to private devotion.
Let the sacred hours of the Sabbath, then, be appropriated to a variety of religious employments. Suppose the
35 case of a young married man. He wishes to pass the
Sabbath in a way acceptable to God, and to enjoy his
religious duties. He rises in good season in the morning,
and commences the day with a short but fervent prayer
for the divine blessing; he then passes the time till break40 fast in reading the Bible. Perhaps, for the sake of variety,
he spends a part of the time in reading the devotional
portions, and a part in perusing its interesting history. At
the breakfast-table, with cheerful countenance and heart,
he leads the conversation to religious subjects; after break176
[EX XI.fast he passes an hour in reading some valuable religious
book. Books are so numerous now, that the best practical
works upon Christianity are easily obtained by all. Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, Baxter's Saint's Rest, Law's
5 Serious Call, Doddridge's Rise and Progress, Imitation of
Christ, &amp;c., are works of standard merit, and works with
which all Christians may and should be acquainted. It
is very desirable that the Christian should have on hand
some such book, which he will read in course, taking a
10 moderate portion every day, until he has finished it.
At length the time arrives for the assembling of his
family for morning prayers. He carries his principle, for
securing an interesting variety, here. Sometiines he will
read religious intelligence from a periodical; sometimes
15 he reads an interesting narrative from a tract; always
taking care to select something which will excite attention.
After finishing this, he opens the Bible and selects some
appropriate passage and reads it, with occasional remarks,
intended to deepen the impression upon his own mind, and
20 upon the minds of those in the circle around him.'He
then reads a hymn, and after singing a few verses, if the
family are able to sing, bows at the family altar in prayer.
The variety which he has thus introduced into the exercise
has continued to interest the feelings, and no occasion has
25 been offered for lassitude or tedium.
He now walks the room for exercise, and reviews the
past week; he thinks of thle opportunities to do good which
he has neglected, examines his feelings and his conduct,
and in ejaculatory prayer seeks forgiveness. When he
30 enters the place of public worship, his mind is ready for
active sertvice there -he unites with his pastor in prayer.
When a hymn is read, he attends to the sentiment, and
makes melody in heart t6 God when singing his praises.
He listens attentively to the sermon, feeling that the re35 sponsibility of being interested in it comes upon him, and
he prays that God will bless it to his own soul, and to the
conversion of others.
Perhaps, in the interval between forenoon and afternoon service, he has a class in the Sabbath-school, or is
40 himself a member of the Bible class: these duties he performs with a sincere desire to do good. After the close
of the afternoon services, he retires for secret prayer. He
appropriates a proper period to this duty, and presents his
own private and personal wants, and the spiritual interests

of others, in minute detail, to God;--he looks forward, too,
to the duties of the week; he brings before his mind the
temptations to which he will be exposed, the opportunities
for'exerting a Christian influence which he possesses, and
5 forms his plans of Christian usefulness for the week; he
thinks of some good object which he will try to advance,
of some individual whom he will try to lead to the Saviour.
He forms his resolutions, and perhaps writes them down,
that he may refer to them again the next Sabbath, in the
10 review of the week. At the appointed hour he assembles
his family for evening prayers. A brief reference to the
religious exercises of the day, or some interesting narrative, followed by the Bible, singing and prayer, again give
variety and animation to the exercise; and when all the
15 duties of the day are over, as he is retiring to rest, he
passes the few moments which remain before slumber has
wrapt his senses in forgetfulness in reviewing the duties
of the day. The Sabbath has been profitably and happily
spent. It has been to him a rich season of improvement
20 and of enjoyment. He has made a Sabbath day's journey
toward heaven; he has obtained strength to meet the
allurements and temptations of life. During the week he
looks back upon the Sabbath with pleasure, and when the
light of another holy morning dawns upon him, he can
25 sincerely say,
"Welcome, delightful morn,
Thou day of sacred rest;
I hail thy kind return -
Lord, make these moments blest."

The Deserted Village.
30    SWEET Auburn! loveliest village of the plain,
Where health and plenty cheered the laboring swain,
Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid,
And parting summer's lingering blooms delayed;
Dear, lovely bowers of innocence and ease,
35 Seats of my youth, when every sport could please,
How often have I loitered o'er thy green,
Where humble happiness endeared each scene!
How often have I pautsed on every charm,The sheltered cot, the cultivated farm,The never-failing brook, the busy mill,
The,decent church that topped the neighlboring hill,
The hawthorn bush, With seats beneath the shade,
For talking age and whispering lovers made!
5    How often have I blessed the coming day,
When toil remitting lent its aid to play,
And all the village train, from labor free,
Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree!
While many a pastime circled in the shade,
10 The young contending as the old surveyed;
And many a gambol frolicked o'er the ground,
And sleights of art and feats of strength went round.
And still, as each repeated pleasure tired,
Succeeding sports the mirthful band inspired:
15 The dancing pair, that simply sought renown
By holding out to tire each other down;
The swain, mistrustless of his smutted face,
While secret laughter tittered round the place;
The bashful virgin's sidelong looks of love,
20 The matron's glance that would those looks reprove:
These were thy charms, sweet village! sports like these,
With sweet succession, taught e'en toil to please;
These round thy bowers their cheerful influence shed,
These were thy charms--but all these charms are fled.
25   Sweet, smiling village, loveliest of the lawn,
Thy sports are fled, and all thy charms withdrawn  
Amid thy bowers the tyrant's hand is seen,
And desolation saddens all thy green;
One only master grasps the whole domain,
30 And half a tillage tints thy smiling plain.
No more thy glassy brook reflects the day,
But, choked with sedges, works its weedy way;
Along thy glades, a solitary guest,
The hollow-sounding bittern guards its nest;
35 Amid thy desert walks the lapwing flies,
And tires their echoes with unvaried cries.
Sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all,
And the long grass o'ertops the mouldering wall;
And, trembling, shrinking from the spoiler's hand,
40 Far, far away thy children leave the land.

RHETORICAL READING.less degree of importance of the words upon which it operates; and
there may be very properly some variety in the use of it: but its appli
cation is not arbitrary, depending on the caprice of readers.
"As emphasis often falls on words in different parts of the sarre sen
tence, so it is frequently required to be continued, with a little variation,
on two, and sometimes more words together. The following sentences
exemplify both the parts of this position:'If you seek to make one
rich, study not to increase 7his stores, but to diminish his desires.''The
Mexican figures, or picture-writing, represent things, not words: they
exhibit images to the eye, not ideas to the understanding."
" Some sentences are so full and comprehensive, that almost every
word is emphatical: as,'Ye hills and dales, ye rivers, woods, and
plains!' or, as that pathetic expostulation in the prophecy of Ezekiel,' Why will ye die!'
"Emphasis, besides its other offices, is the great regulator of quantity.
Though the quantity of our syllables is fixed, in words separately pronounced, yet it is mutable when these words are arranged in sentences;
the long being changed into short, the short into long, according to the
importance of the word with regard to meaning. Emphasis also, in
particular cases, alters the seat of the accent. This is demonstrable
from th'e following examples.'IIe shall increase, but I shall decrease.'
There is a difference between giving and forgiving.'' In this species
of composition, plausibility is much more essential than probability.'
In these examples, the emphasis requires the accent to be placed on
syllables to which it does not commonly belong.
"ln order to acquire the proper management of the emphasis, the
great rule to be given is, that the reader study to attain a just conception
of the force and spirit of the sentiments which he is to pronounce. For
to lay the emphasis with exact propriety is a constant exercise of good
sense and attention. It is far from being  an inconsiderable attainment.
It is one of the most decisive trials of a true and just taste; and must
arise from feeling delicately ourselves, -and from judging accurately of
what is fittest to strike the feelings of others.
"There is one error, against which it is particularly proper to caution
the learnler; namely, that of multiplying emphatical words too much
and using the emphasis indiscriminately. It is only by a prudent
reserve and distinction in the use of them, that we can give them any
weight. If they recur too often; if a reader attempts to render every
thing he expresses of high importance, by a multitude of strong em
phases, we soon learn to pay little regard to them. To crowd every
sentence with emphliatical words, is like crowding all the pages of a book
with Italic characters; which, as to the effect, is just the same as to use
no such distinctions at all.
TONES.
" Tones are different both from emphasis and pauses; consisting in
the notes or variations of sound which we employ in the expression of
our sentiments. Emphasis affects particular words anld phrases, with a
degree of tone or infiectien of voice; but tones, peculiarly so called,
affect sentences, paragraphs, and sometimes even the whole of a discourse.
"To show the use and necessity of tones, we need only observe, that
the mind, in communicating its ideas, is in a constant state of activity,
emotion. or agitation, fromn the different effects which those ideas pro18

And quite forgot their vices in their woe;
Careless their merits or their faults to scan,
20 His pity gave ere charity began.
Thus, to relieve the wretched was his pride,
And even his failings leaned to virtue's side;
But in his duty prompt at every call,
He watched and wept, he prayed and felt, for all.
25 And, as a bird each fond endearment tries
To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,
He tried each art, reproved.each dull delay,
Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way.
Beside the bed where parting life was laid,
30 And sorrow, guilt, and pain by turns dismayed,
The reverend champion stood. At his control,
Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;
Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,
And his last faltering accents whispered praise.
35   At church, with meek and unaffected graer
His looks adorned the venerable place;
Truth from his lips prevailed with double sway,
And fools, who came to scoff, remained to pray.
The service past, around the pious man,
40 With steady zeal, each honest rustic ran;
Even children followed with endearing wile,
And plucked his gown to share the good man's smile.
His ready smile a parent's warmth expressed;
Their welfare pleased him, and their cares distressed:

[EX. XVTo them his heart, his love, his griefs, were given,
But all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven.
As some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,
Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,
5 Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,
Eternal sunshine settles on its head.
Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,
With blossomed fiurze unprofitably gay,
There, in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule,
10 The village master taught his little school:
A man severe he was, and stern to view;
I knew him well, and every truant knew;
Well had the boding tremblers learned to trace
The day's'disasters in his morning face;
15 Full well they laughed and counterfeited glee
At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;
Full well the busy whisper, circling round,
Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned.
Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught,
20 The love lie bore to learning was in fault;
The village all declared how much he knew -'T was certain he could write, and cipher too;
Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,
And e'en the story ran that he could gauge.
25   In arguing, too, the parson owned his skill,
For e'en though vanquished, he could argue still;
While words of learned length and thundering sound
Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around;
And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew,
30 That one small head could carry all he knew.
But past is all his fame. The very spot
Where many a time he triumphed is forgot.
Near yonder thorn, that lifts its head on high,
Where once the sign-post caught the passing eye,
35 Low lies that house where nut-brown draughts inspired,
Where graybeard mirth and smiling toil retired,
Where village statesmen talked with looks profound,
And news much older than their ale went round
Imagination fondly stops to trace
40 The parlor splendors of that festive place;
The whitewashed wall, the nicely-sanded floor,*
The varnished clock that clicked behind the door;

With all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed,
In these, ere triflers half their wish obtain,

Takes up a space that many poor supplied;

Space for his horses, equipage, and hounds;
The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth
Has robbed the neighboring fields of half their growth;
His seat, where solitary sports are seen,

Around the world each needful product flies,
For all the luxuries the world supplies.
While thus the land, adorned for pleasure all,
In barren splendor feebly waits the fall.

Secure to please while youth confirms her reign,
Slights every borrowed charm that dress supplies,
Nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes;

20 When time advances, and when lovers fail,

In nature's simplest charms at first arrayed;
25 But, verging to decline, its splendors rise,
Its vistas strike, its palaces surprise;
While, scourged by famine from the smiling land,
The mournful peasant leads his humble band;
And while he sinks, without one arm to save,

The rattling chariots clash, the torches glare.

Where the dark scorpion gathers death around:
Where at each step the stranger fears to wake
The rattling terrors of the vengeful snake;
Where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey,

Mingling the ravaged landscape with the skies.

The Journey of a Day; a Picture of Hluman Life.
OBIDAH, the son of Abensina, left the caravansera early
in the morning, and pursued his journey through the
plains of Indostan. Hie was fresh and vigorous with rest;
30 he was animated with hope; he was incited by desire;
he walked swiftly forward over the valleys, and saw the
hills. gradually rising before him.
As he passed along, his ears were delighted with the
morning song of the bird of paradise; he was fanned by
35 the last flutters of the sinking breeze, and sprinkled with
dew from groves of spices. He sometimes contemplated
the towering height of the oak, monarch of the hills; and
sometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the prinlrose,
188
[EX. xm.eldest daughter of the spring: all his senses were gratified, and all care was banished from his heart.
Thus he went on, till the sun approached his meridian,
and the increased heat preyed upon his strength; he then
5  looked round about him for some more commodious path.
He saw, on his right hand, a grove that seemed to wave
its shades as a sign of invitation; he entered it, and found
the coolness and verdure irresistibly pleasant.
He did not, however, forget whither he was traveling,
10 but found a narrow way bordered with flowers, which appeared to have the same direction with the main road;
and was pleased, that, by this happy experiment, he had
found means to unite pleasure with business, and to gain
the rewards of diligence without suffering its fatigues.
15   He, therefore, still continued to wall for a time, without
the least remission of his ardor, except that he was sometimes tempted to stop by the music of the birds, which the
heat had assembled in the shade; and sometimes amused
himself with plucking the flowers that covered the banks
20 on either side, or the fruits that hung upon the branches.
At last, the green path began to decline from its first
tenulency, and to wind among hills and thickets, cooled
with fountains, and murmuring with waterfalls. Here
Obidah paused for a time, and began to consider whether
25 it were longer safe to forsake the known and common
track; but remembering that the heat was now in its
greatest violence, and that the plain was dusty and uneven,
he resolved to pursue the new path, wvhich he supposed
only to make a few meanders, in compliance with the va30 rieties of the ground, and to end at last in the common
road.
Having thus calmed his solicitude, he renewed his pace,
though he suspected that he was not gaining ground.
This uneasiness of his mind inclined him to lay hold on
35 every new object, and give way to every sensation that
might soothe or divert him. He listened to every echo;
he mounted every hill for a fresh prospect; he turned
aside to every cascade; and pleased himself with tracing
the course of a gentle river that rolled among the trees
40 and watered a large region with innumerable circumvolutions.
In these amusements the hours passed away unaccounted; his deviations had perplexed his memory, and he
knew not towards what point to travel. He stood pensive

merely to lay open the ideas, but also the different feelings which they
excite in him that utters them, there must be other signs than words to
manifest those feelings; as words uttered in a monotonous manner can
represent only a similar state of mind, perfectly free from all activity
and emotion. As the communication of these internal feelings was of
much more consequence in our social intercourse than the mere conveyance of ideas, the Author of our being did not, as in that conveyance, leave the invention of the language of emotion to man, but
impressed it himself upon our nature, in the same manner as he has
done with regard to the rest of the animal world; all of which express
their feelings by various tones. Ours, indeed, from the superior rank
that we hold, are in a high degree more comprehensive; as there is not
an act of the mind, an exertion of the fancy, or an emotion of the heart,
Which has not its peculiar tone or note of the voice, by which it is to be
expressed; and which is suited exactly to the degree of internal feeling.
It is chiefly in the proper use of these tones, that the life, spirit, beauty,
and harmony of delivery consist.
"The limits of this introduction do not admit of examples to illustrate
the variety of tones belonging to the different passions and emotions.
We shall, however, select one, which is extracted from the beautiful
lamentation of David over Saul and Jonathan; and which will in some
degree elucidate what has been said on this subject.'The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places; how are the
mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath; publish it not in the streets of
Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice; lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there
be no dew nor rain upon you, nor fields of offerings; for there the shield
of the mighty was vilely cast away; the shield of Saul, as though he
had not been anointed with oil.' The first of these divisions expresses
sorrow and lamentation; therefore the note is low. The next contains
a spirited command, and should be pronounced much higher. The other
sentence, in which he makes a pathetic address to the mnountains where
his friends had been slain, must be expressed in a note quite different
from the two former; not so low as the first, nor so high as the second
but in a manly, firm, yet plaintive tone.
"The correct and natural language of the emotionls is not so difficult
to be attained as most readers seem to imagine. If we enter into the
spirit of the author's sentiments, as well as into the meaning of his
words, we shall not fail to deliver the words in properly varied tones.
For there are few people who speak English without a provincial note
that have not an accurate use of tones, when they utter their sentiments
in earnest discourse. And the reason that they have not the samne use
of them in reading aloud the sentiments of others may be traced to the
very defective and erroneous method in which the art of reading is
taught; whereby all the various, natural, expressive tones of speech are
suppressed, and a few artificial, unmeaning reading notes are substituted for them.
"But when we recommend to readers an attention to the tone and
language of emotions, we must be understood to do it with propei limitation. Moderation is necessary in this point, as in other things. For
when the reading becomes strictly imitative, it assumes a theatrical
manner, and must be highly improper, as well as give offense to the
hearers, because it is inconsistent with that delieacy and modesty which

yet conscious that the time of loitering was now past.
While he was thus tortured with uncertainty, the sky was
overspread with clouds; the day vanished from before him,
5  and a sudden tempest gathered round his head.
He was now roused by his danger to a quick and paipful remembrance of his folly; he now saw how happiness
is lost when ease is consulted; he lamented the unmanly
impatience that prompted him to seek shelter in the grove.
10 and despised the petty curiosity that led him on from trifle
to trifle. While he was thus reflecting, the air grew
blacker, and a clap of thunder broke his meditation.
He now resolved to do what yet remained in his powerto tread back the ground which he had passed, and try to
15 find some issue where the wood might open into the plain.
He prostrated himself on the ground, and recommended
his life to the Lord of Nature. He rose with confidence
and tranquillity, and pressed on with resolution.
The beasts of the desert were in motion, and on every
20 hand were heard the mingled howls of rage and fear, and
ravage and expiration. All the horrors of darkness and
solitude surrounded him; the winds roared in the woods,
and the torrents tumbled from the hills.
Thus forlorn and distressed, he wandered through the
25 wild, without knowing whither he wvas going, or whether
he was every moment drawing nearer to safety, or to destruction. At length, not fear, but labor, began to overcome him; his breath grew short, and his knees trembled,
and he was on the point of lying down in resignation to
30 his fate, when he beheld, through the brambles, the glimmer of a taper.
He advanced towards the light, and finding that it proceeded from the cottage of a hermit, he called humbly at
the door, and obtained admission. The old man set be3,5 fore him such provisions as he had collected for himself,
on which Obidah fed with eagerness and gratitude.
When the repast was over, "Tell me," said the hermit,
"by what chance thou hast been brought hither? I have
been now twenty years an inhabitant of the wilderness, in
40 which I never saw a man before."  Obidah then related
the occurrences of his journey, without any concealment
or palliation.
" Son," said the hermit, "let the errors and follies, the
dangers and escape, of this day, sink deep into thy heart.

Remember, my son, that human life is the joumrney of a
day. We rise in the morning of youth, full of vigor, and
full of expectation; we set forward with spirit and hope,
with gayety and with diligence, and travel on a while in
5  the direct road of piety towards the mansions of rest. In
a short time, we remit our fervor, and endeavor to find
some mitigation of pur duty, and some more easy means
of obtaining the same end.
"We then relax oiur vigor, and resolve no longer to be
10 terrified with crimes at a distance; but rely upon our own
constancy, and venture to approach what we resolve never
to touch. We thus enter the bowers of ease, and repose
in the shades of security. Here the heart softens, and
vigilance subsides; we are then willing to inquire whether
15 another advance cannot be made, and whether we may
not, at least, turn our eyes upon the gardens of pleasure.
" We approach them with scruple and hesitation; we enter
them, but enter timorous and trembling; and always'hope
to pass through them without losing the road of virtue,
20 which, for a while, we keep in our sight, and to which we
purpose to return.
"But temptation succeeds temptation, and one compliance prepares us for another; we in time lose the happiness of innocence, and solace our disquiet with sensual
25 gratifications. By degrees, we let fall the remembrance
of our original intention, and quit the only adequate object of rational desire. We entangle ourselves in business, immerge ourselves in luxury, and rove through the
labyrinths of inconstancy; till the darkness of old age
30 begins to invade us, and disease and anxiety obstruct our
way.
"We then look back upon our lives with horror, with
sorrow, with repentance; and wish, but too often vainly
wish, that we had not forsaken the ways of virtue. Happy
35 are they, my son, who shall learn from thy example not
to despair; but shall remember, that, though the day is
past, and their strength is wasted, there yet remains one
effort to be made; that reformation is never hopeless, nor
sincere endeavors ever unassisted; that the wanderer may
40 at length return after all his errors, and that he who implores strength and courage from above shall find danger
and difficulty give way before him.

E X. M'And there came a traveler unto the rich man, and he
spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to
dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him;
but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man
5 that was come to him.
And David's anger was greatly kindled against tne man;
and he said to Nathan, As the Lord liveth, the man that
hath done this thing shall surely die. And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and
10 because he had no pity.
And Nathan said to David, Thou' art the man. Thus
saith the Lord God of Israel, I anointed thee king over
Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul. And
I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives
15 into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of
Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover
have given unto thee such and such things.
Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the
Lord, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the
20 Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy
wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of
Ammon. Now therefore the sword shall never depart from
thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken
the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. Thus saith
25 the Lord, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of
thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine
eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor.
And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the
Lord. And Nathan said unto David, The Lord also hath
30 put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. Howbeit, because
by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies
of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also that is born unta
thee shall surely die.
And Nathan departed unto his house.

considered.
To us, who dwell on its surface, the earth is by far the
most extensive orb that our eyes can anywhere behold: it
is also clothed with verdure, distinguished by trees, and
adorned with a variety of beautiful decorations.; whereas,
5 to a spectator placed on one of the planets, it wears a uniform aspect; looks all luminous; and no larger than a
spot.
To beings who dwell at still greater distances, it entirely
disappears. That which we call alternately the morning
10 and the evening star (as in one part of the orbit she rides
foremost in the procession of night, in the other ushers in
and anticipates the dawn) is a planetary world.  This
planet, and the four others that so wonderfully vary their
mystic dance, are in themselves dark bodies, and shine
15 only by reflection; have fields and seas and skies of their
own; are furnished with all accolnmodations for animal
subsistence, and are supposed to'be the abodes of intellectual life; all which, together with our earthly habitations,
are dependent on that grand dispenser of divine munifi20 cence, the sun; receive their light from the distribution
of his rays, and derive their comfort from his benign
agency.
The s-un, which seems to perform his daily stages through
thne sky, is in this respect fixed and immovable; he is the
25 great axle of heaven, about which the globe we inhabit,
and other more spacious orbs, wheel their stated courses.
The sun, though seemingly smaller than the dial he illuminates, is abundantly larger than this whole earth, on which
so many lo`ty mountains rise, and such vast oceans roll.
30 A line extending from side to side, through the center of
that resplendent orb, would measure more than eight hundred thousand miles; a girdle formed to go round his circumference would require a length of millions. Were his
solid contents to be estimated, the account would overwhelm
35 our understanding, and be almost beyond the power of
language to express. Are we startled at these reports of
philosophy?
Are we ready to cry out, in a transport of surprise,
" How mighty is the Being, who kindled so prodigious a
40 fire, and keeps alive, fror age to age, so enormous a mnass
1.Ss$
EX. xH.l
197of flame?" Let us attend our philosophical guides, and
we shall be brought acquainted with speculations more
enlarged and more inflaming.
This sun, with all his attendant planets, is but a very
5  little part of the grand machine of the universe; every
star, though in appearance no bigger than the diamond
that glitters upon a lady's ring, is really a vast globe, like
the sun in size and in glory; no less spacious, no less
luminous, than the radiant source of day. So that every
10 star is not barely a world, but the center of a magnificent
system; has a retinue of worlds, irradiated by its beams,
and revolving round its attractive influence, all which are
lost to our sight in unmeasurable wilds of ether.
That the stars appear like so many diminutive and
15 scarcely distinguishable points, is owing to their immense
and inconceivable distance. Immense and inconceivable
indeed it is, since a ball shot from the loaded cannon, and
flying with unabated rapidity, must travel, at this impetuous rate, almost seven hundred thousand years, before it
20 could reach the nearest of these twinkling luminaries.
While, beholding this vast expanse, I learn my own extreme meanness, I would also discover the abject littleness
of all terrestrial things. What is the earth, with all her
ostentatious scenes, compared with this astonishing grand
25 furniture of the skies? what, but a dim speck, hardly perceivable in the map of the universe?
It is observed by a very judicious writer, that if the sun
himself, which enlightens this part of the creation, were
extinguished, and all the host of planetary worlds, which
30 move about him, were annihilated, they would not be
missed by an eye that can take in the whole compass of
nature, any more than a grain of sand upon the sea-shore.
The bulk of which they consist, and the space which they
occupy, are so exceedingly little in comparison of the
35 whole, that their loss would scarcely leave a blank in the
immensity of God's works.
If, then, not our globe only, but this whole system, be
so very diminutive, what is a kingdom, or a country?
What are a few lordships, or the so much admired patri40 monies of those who are styled wealthy? When I measure them with my own little pittance, they swell into
proud and bloated dimensions: but when I take the universe for my standard, how scanty is their size, how
contemptible their figure! They shrink into pompous
45 nothings. -- Addison.

are indlspensable on such occasions. The speaker who delivers his own
emotions must be supposed to be more vivid and animated than would
be proper in the person who relates them at second hand.
" We shall conclude this section with the following rule for the tones
that indicate the passions and emotions:'In reading, let all your tones
of expression be borrowed from those of common speech, but, in some
degree, more faintly characterized. Let those tones which signify any
disagreeable passion of the mind be still more faint than those which
indicate agreeable emotions: and on all occasions preserve yourselves
from being so far affected with the subject as to be unable to proceed
through it with that easy and masterly manner which has its good
effects in this, as well as ill every other art.'
- PAUSES.
"Pauses or rests, in reading or speaking, are a total cessation of the
voice, during a perceptible, and, in many cases, a measurable space of
time. Pauses are equally necessary to the speaker and the hearer. To
the speaker, that he may take breath, without which he cannot proceed,
far in delivery; and that he may, by these temporary rests, relieve the
organs of speech, which otherwise would be soon tired by continued
action; to the hearer, that the ear also may be relieved from the fatigiue
which it would otherwise endure from a continuity of sound; and that
the understanding may have sufficient time to mark the distinction of
sentences, and their several members.
" There are two kinds of pauses: first, emphatical pauses; and next,
such as mark the distinctions of sense. An emphatical pause is generally made after something has been said of peculiar moment, and on
which we desire to fix the hearer's attention. Sonletirres, before such a
thing is said, we usher it in with a pause of this nature. Such pauses
have the same effect as a strong emphasis; and are subject to the same
rules, especially to the caution of not repeating them too frequently
For as they excite uncommon attention, and of course raise expectation,
if the importance of the matter be not filly answerable to such expect
ation, they occasion disappointment and disgust.
"But the most frequent and principal use of pauses is to mark the
divisions of the sense, and at the same time to allow the reader to draw
his breath; and the proper and delicate adjustment of such pauses is
one of the most nice and difficult articles of delivery. In all reading,
the management of the breath requires a good deal of care, so as not to
oblige us to divide words from one another, which have so intimate a
connection that they ought to be pronounced with the same breath, and
-without the least separation. MVlany a sentence is miserably mangled,
and the force of the emphasis totally lpst, by divisions being made in the
wrong place. To avoid this, every one, while he is reading, should be
very carefill to provide a full supply of breath for what he is to utter.
It is a great mistake to imagine that the breath must be drawn only at
the end of a period, when the voice is allowed to fall. It may easily be
gathered at the intervals of the period, when the voice is suspended only
for a moment; alnd, by this management, one may always have a sufficient stock for carrying on the longest sentence, without improper interruptions.
" Pauses in reading must generally be formne( upon the manner in
which we utter ouirselves in ordinary, sensible conversation, and not
upon the stiff; artificial manner which is acquired fromn reading booksPARKER'S EXERCISES IN

" Then by these tokens may'st thou know

He gave him of his highland cheer,
The hardened flesh of mountain deer;
Dry fuel on the fire he laid,
And bade the Saxon share his plaid;
15    He tended him like welcome guest,
Then thuis his further speech addressed:

25    It rests wvith me, here, brand to brand,
Worn as thou art, to bid thee stand;
But, nor for clan nor kindred's cause,
Will I depart from honor's laws:
To assail a wearied man were shame,.

In vain he never must require.

40    As freely as't is nobly given! "--
"Well, rest thee; for the bittern's cry

When, rousiing at its glimmer red,
The warriors left their lowly bed,
Looked out upon the dappled sky,

And then awaked their fire, to steal,
As short and rude, their soldier meal.

His graceful plaid of varied hue,

By thicket green and mountain gray.

Along the precipice's brow,
Commanding the rich scenes beneath, -
20     The windings of the Forth and Teith,

Gained not the length of horseman's lance.

Dark lowered the clansman's sable scowl:
A space he paused, then sternly said,

according to the common punctuation. It will by no means be sufficient
to attend to the points used in printing, for these are far from marking
all the pauses which ought to be made in reading. A mechanical attention to these resting places has perhaps been one cause of monotony, by
leading the reader to a similar tone at every stop, and a uniform cadence
at every period. The primary use of points is to assist the reader in
discerning the grammatical construction; and it is only as a secondary
object that they regulate his pronunciation. On this head the following
direction may be of use:' Though ill reading great attention should be
paid to the stops, yet a greater should be given to the sense, and their
correspondent times occaslonally lengthened beyond what is usual in
common speech.'
" To render pauses pleasing and expressive, they must not only be
made in the right place, but also accompanied with a proper tone of
voice, by which the nature of these pauses is intimated; much more
than by the length of them, which can seldom be exactly measured.
Sometimes it is only a slight and simple suspension of voice that is
proper; sometimes a degree of cadence in the voice is required; and
sometimes that peculiar tone and cadence which denote the sentence to
be finished. In all these cases, we are to regulate ourselves by attending to the manner in which nature teaches us to speak when engaged in
real and earnest discourse with others. The following sentence exemplifies the suspending and the closing pauses:'Hope, the balm of life,
soothes us under every misfortune.' The first and second pauses are
accompanied by an inflection of voice, that gives the hearer an expectation of something further to complete the sense; the inflection attending
the third pause signifies that the sense is completed.
" The preceding example is an illustration of the suspending pause, in
its simple state: the following instance exhibits that pause with a degree
of cadence in the voice;' If content cannot remove the disquietudes of
mankind, it will at least alleviate them.'
" The suspending pause is often, in the same sentence, attended with
both the rising and the falling inflection of voice; as will be seen in this
example:'Moderate exercise', and habitual temperance', strengthen
the constitution.' -@
"As the suspending pause may be thus attended with both the rising
and the falling inflection, it is the same with regard to the closing pause:
it admits of both. The falling inflection generally accompanies it; but
it is not unfrequently connected with the rising inflection. Interrogative
sentences, for instance, are often terminated in this manner: as,' Am I
ungrateful?'' Is he in earnest'?'
" But where a sentence is begun by an interrogative pronoun or adverb, it is commonly terminated by the falling inflection: as,' What has
he gained by his folly'?'  Who will assist him'?'' Where is the messenger'?'' When did he arrive'?'
" When two questions are united in one sentence, and connected by
the conjunction or, the first takes the rising, the second the falling in.
flection: as,' Does his conduct support discipline' or destroy it'?.'
"The rising and falling inflections must not be confounded with
emphasis. Though they may often coincide, they are, in their nature,
perfectly distinct. Emphasis sometimes controls those inflections.
"The regular application of the rising and falling inflections confers
* Tile rising inflection is denoted by the acute, the falling by the grave, accent.PARKER'S EXERCISES IN

his passage.
30   Terrestrial happiness is of short continuance. The
brightness of the flame is wasting its fuel; the fragrant
flower is passing away-in its own odors. The vigor of
Omar began to fail; the' curls of beauty fell from his

10 The arts by which thou hast gained power and preserved

me the secret of thy conduct, and teach me the plan upon
which thy wisdom has built thy fortune."
"Young man," said Omar, "it is of little use to form
15 plans of life. When I took my first survey of the world,
in my twentieth year, having considered the various conditions of mankind, in the hour of solitude I said thus to
myself, leaning against a cedar, which spread its branches
over my head:'Seventy years are allowed to man; I
20 have yet fifty remaining.

learned, and therefore shall be honored; every city will
shout at my arrival, and every student will solicit my

mind with images, which I shall be busy, through the rest
of my life, in combining and comparing. I shall revel in
inexhaustible accumnulations of intellectual riches; I shall
find new pleasures for every moment, and shall never
30 more be weary of myself.

wealth can purchase, and fancy call invent.
"' I will then retire to a rural dwelling; pass my days
in obscurity and contemplation; and lie silently down on
the bed of death. Through my life it shall be my settled

A Dream.
1 HAD a dream - a strange, wild dream -
Said a dear voice at early light;
And even yet its shadows seem
To linger in my waking sight.
5     Earth, green with spring, and fresh with dew,
And bright with morn, before me stood;
And airs, just wakened, softly blew
On the young blossoms of the wood.
Birds sang within the sprouting shade,
10  Bees hummed amid the whispering grass,
And children prattled as they played
Beside the rivulet's dimpling glass.
Fast climbed the sun: the flowers were flowrn
There played no children in the glen;
15  For some were gone, and some were grown
To blooming dames and bearded men.'T was noon,'twas summer: I beheld
Woods darkening in the flush of day,
And that bright rivulet spread and swelled,
20  A mighty stream, with creek and bay.
And here was love, and there was strife,
And mirthful shouts, and wrathful cries,
And strong men, struggling as for life,
With knotted limbs and angry eyes.
25    Now stooped the sun - the shades grew thin;
The rustling paths were piled with leaves;
And sun-burnt groups were gathering in,
From the shorn field, its fruits and sheaves.
The river heaved with sullen sounds;
130  The chilly winds were sad with moans;
Black hearses passed, and burial-grounds
Grew thick with monumental stones.
Still waned the day; the wind that chased
The jagged clouds blew chillier yet;
35  The woods were stripped, the fields were waste,
The wintry sun was near its set.
And of the young, and strong, and fair,
A lonely remnant, gray and weak,
Lingered and shivered to the air
40 Of that bleak shore and water bleak.

Ortogrul; or, the Vanity of Riches.
As Ortogrul, of Basra, was one day wandering along
the streets of Bagdat, musing on the varieties of merchan15 dise which the shops opened to his view, and observing
the different occupations which busied the multitude on
every side, he was awakened from the tranquillity of meditation by a crowd that obstructed his passage. He raised
his eyes, and saw the chief vizier, who, having returned
20 from the divan, was entering his palace.
Ortogrul mingled with the attendants; and being supposed to have some petition for the vizier, was permnitted
to enter. He surveyed the spaciousness of the apartments,
admired the walls hung with golden tapestry, and the
25 floors covered with silken carpets; and despised the simple
neatness of his own little habitation.
" Surely," said he to himself, " this palace is the seat
of happiness; where pleasure succeeds to pleasure, and
discontent and sorrow can have no admission. Whatever
30 nature has provided for the delight of sense is here spread
forth to be enjoyed. What can mortals hope or imagine
which the master of this palace has not obtained?
" The dishes of luxury cover his table; the voice of harmony lulls him in his bowers; he breathes the fragrance
35 of the groves of Java, and sleeps upon the down of the
cygnets of Ganges. He speaks; and his mandate is
obeyed; he wishes, and his wish is gratified; all whom
he sees obey him, and all whom he hears flatter him.
214
[EX. xx."How different, oh Ortogrul! is thy condition, who art
doomed to the perpetual torments of unsatisfied desire;
and who hast no amusement in thy power that can withhold thee from thy own reflections! They tell thee that
5 thou art wise; but what does wisdom avail with poverty?
None will flatter the poor; and the wise have very little
power of flattering themselves.
" That man is surely the most wretched of the sons of
wretchedness who lives with his own faults and follies
10 always before him, and who has none to reconcile him to
himself by praise and veneration. I have long sought content, and have not found it; I will from this moment
endeavor to be rich."
Full of this new resolution, he shut himself in his cham15 ber for six months, to deliberate how he should grow rich.
He sometimes purposed to offer himself as a counselor to
one of the kings in India, and sometimes resolved to dig
for diamonds in the mines of Golconda.
One day, after some hours passed in violent fluctuation
20 of opinion, sleep insensibly seized him in his chair. He
dreamed that he was ranging a desert country, in search
of some one that might teach him to grow rich; and as he
stood on the top of a hill, shaded with cypress, in doubt
whither to direct his steps, his father appeared on a sudden
25 standing before him.
"Ortogrul," said the old man, "I know thy perplexity;
listen to thy father. Turn thine eye on the opposite mountain."  Ortogrul looked, and saw a torrent tumbling down
the rocks, roaring with the noise of thunder, and scattering
30 its foam on the impending woods. " Now," said his father,
"behold the valley that lies between the hills."  Ortogrul
looked, and espied a little well, out of which issued a small
rivulet. " Tell me, now," said his father, "' dost thou wish
for sudden affluence, that may pour upon thee like the
35 mountain torrent; or for a slow and gradual increase, resembling the rill gliding from the well?"
"Let me be quickly rich," said Ortogrul; " let the golden stream be quick and violent."  "Look around thee,"
said his father, "once again."  Ortogrul looked, and per-:0 ceived the channel of the torrent dry and dusty; but following the rivulet from the well, he traced it to a wide
lake, which the supply, slow and constant, kept always
full. He awvoke, and determined to grow rich by silent
profit, and persevering industry.

Omniscience and Omnipresence of thte Deity, the Soztrce of
Consolation to Good Men.
I was yesterday, about sunset, walking in the open
fields, till ihe night insensibly fell upon me. I at first
amused myself with all the richness and variety of colors
wvhich appeared in the western parts of heaven. In pro15 portion as they faded away and went out, several stars
and planets appeared, one after another, till the whole
firmament was in a glow.
The blueness of the ether was exceedingly heightened
and enlivened by the season of the year, and the rays of
20 all those luminaries that passed throiugh it. The galaxy
appeared in its most beautiful white. To complete the
scene, the full moon rose, at length, in that clouded majesty which Milton takes notice of; and opened to the eye a
new picture of nature, which was more finely shaded, and
25 disposed among softer lights, than that which the sun had
before discovered to me.
As I was surveying the moon walking in her brightness,
and taking her progress among the constellations, a thought
arose in me, which I believe very often perplexes and dis30 turbs men of serious and contemplative natures. David
himself fell into it in that reflection: "When I consider
the heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and the
stars which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou
art mindful of him, and the son of man, that thou regard35 est him!"
In the same mnanner, when I considered that infinite host
of stars, or, to speak more philosophically, of suns, which
19
F=. xxIII.
211'were then shining upon me; with those innumerable sets
of planets or worlds, which were moving round their respective suns; when I still enlarged the idea, and supposed
another heaven of suns and worlds, rising still above this
6  which I discovered; and these still enlightened by a superior firmament of luminaries, which are planted at so
great a distance that they may appear to the inhabitants
of the former as the stars do to me: in short, while I pursued this thought, I could not but reflect on that little in10 significant figure which I myself bore amridst the immensity of God's works.
Were the sun which enlightens this part of the creation, with all the host of planetary worlds that move about
him, utterly extinguished and annihilated, they would not
15 be missed, more than a grain of sand upon the sea-shore.
The space they possess -is so exceeding little in comparison of the whole, it would scarcely make a blank in the
creation. The chasm would be imperceptible to an eye
that could take in the whole compass of nature, and' pass
20 from one end of the creation to the other; as it is possible
there may be such a sense in ourselves hereafter, or in
creatures which are at present more exalted than ourselves.
By the help of glasses, we see many stars which we do
25 not discover with our naked eyes; and the finer our telescopes are, the greater still are our discoveries.
Huygenius carries this thought so far, that he does not
think it impossible there may be stars, whose light has not
yet traveled down to us since their first creation. There
30 is no question that the universe has certain bounds set to
it; but when we consider that it is the work of Infinite
Power, prompted by Infinite Goodness, with an infinite
space to exert itself in, how can our imagination set any
bounds to it?
35   To return, therefore, to my first thought-I could not
but look uporl myself with secret horror, as a being that
was not worth the smallest regard of one who had so
great a work under his care and superintendency. I was
afraid of being overlooked amidst the immensity of nature,
40 and lost among that infinite variety of creatures, which,
in all probability, swarm through all these immeasurable
regions of matter.
In order, to recover myself from this mortifying thought:
I considered that it took its rise from those narrow coen

ceptions which we are apt to entertain of the Divine
Nature.  We ourselves cannot attend to many diflfrent
objects at the same time. If we are careful to inspect
some things, we must of course neglect others. This im5  perfection which we observe in ourselves is an imperfection that cleaves, in some degree, to creatures of the
highest capacities, as they are creatures; that is, beings
of finite and lilnited natures.
The presence of every created being is confined to a
10 certain measure of space; and, consequently, his observation is stinted to a certain number of objects. The sphere
in which we move, and act, and understand, is of a wider
circumference to one creature than another, according as
we rise one above another in the scale of existence. But
15 thexwidest of these our spheres has its circumference.
When, therefore, we reflect on the Divine Nature, we
are so used and accustomed to this imperfection in ourselves, that we cannot forbear, in some measure, ascribing
it to Him in whom there is no shadow of imperfection.
20 Our reason, indeed, assures us that his attributes are infinite; but the poorness of our conceptions is such, that it
cannot forbear setting bounds to everything it contemplates, till our reason comes again to our succor, and
throws down all those little prejudices which rise in us
25 unawares, and are natural to the mind of man.
We shall therefore utterly extinguish this melancholy
thought, of our being overlooked by our Maker, in the
multiplicity of his works, and the infinity of those objects
among which he seems to be incessantly employed, if we
30 consider, in the first place, that he is omnipresent; and,
in the second, that he is omniscient.
If we consider him in his omnipresence, his being passes
through, actuates, and supports, the whole frame of nature.
His creation, in every part of it, is full of him. There is
35 nothing he has made, which is either so distant, so little,
or so inconsiderable, that he does not essentially reside in
it. His substance is within the substance of every being,'whether material or immaterial, and as intimately present
to it as that being is to itself.
40    It would be" an imperfection in him, were he able to
move out of one place into another; or to withdraw himself from anything he has created, or fromn any part ot
that space which he diffused and spread abroad to infinity.

MSIANNER OF READING VERSE.
"' When we are reading verse, there is a peculiar difficulty in making
the pauses justly. The difficulty arises from the melody of verse, which
dictates to the ear pauses or rests of its own; and to adjust and compound these properly with the pauses of the sense, so as neither to hurt
the ear nor offend the understanding, is so very nice a matter, that it is
no wonder we so seldom meet with good readers of poetry. There are
two kinds of pauses that belong to the melody of verse: one is the pause
at the end of the line; and the other, the cesural pause in or near the
middle of it. With regard to the pause at the end of the line, which
marks that strain or verse to be finished, rhyme renders this always sensible, and in some measure compels us to observe it in our pronunciation. In respect to blank verse, we ought also to read it so as to make
every line sensible to the ear; for, what is the use of melody, or for what
end has the poet composed in verse, if, in reading his lines, we suppress
his numbers, by omitting the final.pause; and degrade them, by our
pronunciation, into mere prose? At the same time that we attend to
this pause, every appearance of sing-song and tone must be carefully
guarded against. The close of the line, where it makes no pause in
the meaning, ought not to be marked by such a tone as is used in
finishing a sentence; but, without either fall or elevation of the voice,
it should be denoted only by so slight a suspension of sound as may
distinguish the passage from one line to another, without injuring the
meaning.
" The other kind of melodious pause is that which falls somewhere
about the middle of the verse, and divides it into two hemistichs; a

In the second place, he is omniscient as well as omnipresent. His omniscience, indeed, necessarily and natu5  rally flows from his omnipresence. He cannot but be
conscious of every motion that arises in the whole material world, which he thus essentially pervades; and of
every thought that is stirring in the intellectual world, to
every part of which he is thus intimately united.
10   Were the soul separated from the body, and should it
with one glance of thought start beyond the bounds of the

would still find itself within the embrace of its Creator,

In this consideration of the Almighty's omnipresence
and omniscience, every uncomfortable thought vanishes.
He cannot but regard everything that has being, especially such of his creatures who fear they are not regarded by

any of his creatures, so we may be confident that he regards with an eye of mercy those who endeavor to recom25 mend themselves to his notice, and, in an unfeigned humility of heart, think themselves unworthy that he should

Domestic Employment.
SINCE Industry is the aliment of contentment and happiness, the female sex are privileged in the variety of
employments that solicit their attention. These are so
diversified in their combinations of amusement with utili5  ty, that no room need be left for the melancholy of a vacant
and listless mind.
Needle-work, in all its forms of use, elegance and ornament, has ever been the appropriate occupation of woman.
From the shades of Eden, when its humble process was
10 but to unite the fig-leaf, to the days when the mother of
Sisera looked from her window, in expectation of a "prey
of divers colors of needle-work on both sides, meet for the
necks of those that take the spoil," down to modern times,
when nature's pencil is rivalled by the most exquisite tis15 sues of embroidery, it has been both their duty and their
resource. While the more delicate efforts of the needle
rank high among accomplishments, its necessary departments are not beneath the notice of the most refinod
young lady.
20    To keep her own wardrobe perfectly in order, to pay
just regard to economy, and to add to the comfort of the
poor, it will be necessary to obtain a knowledge of those
inventions by which the various articles of apparel are repaired, modified and renovated. True satisfaction, and
25 cheerfulness of spirits, are connected with these quiet and
congenial pursuits.
This has been simply and fortunately expressed by ono
of our sweetest poets:--
"It rains.- What lady loves a rainy day?
She loves a raily day, who sweeps the hearth,
And threads the busy needle, or applies
The scissors to the torn or thread-bare sleeve;
Who blesses God that she has friends and home;
Who, in the pelting of the storm, will think
Of some poor neighbor that slie call befriend;
Who trims the lamp at night, and reads aloud,
To a young brother, tales he loves to hear;
Such are not sad even on a rainy day."
The queen of Louis XI. of France was a pattern of
40 industry to her sex.  Surrounding herself with the daughters of the nobility, whom she called her daughters, she
was both their teacher and companion, in elegant works
22
[EX. 2TLRHETORICAL READING.
of embroidery and tapestry. The churches were adorned
with these proofs of their diligence and ingenuity.  She
considered industry a remedy for a disordered imagrination, and a shield against the temptations of a fashionable
5 life.
Hence prudence and modesty marked the manners of
that court, wvhere their opposites had once prevailed, and
the blooming and elegant train by whom she was attended
"bore in their hearts the honor and virtue which she
10 planted there."
It has been sometimes urged as an objec:-on against the
modern system of female education; that che wide range
of science which it comprises turns the attenti)n of the
young from household duty, and renders them impatient
15 of its details and labors. This argument seems to address
itself to rnothers. It might be in their power to refute it,
and to associate in the minds of their daughters, with a love
of study, a knowledge of the unpretending pursuits of
their own future province.
20    Maternal affection would naturally prompt the wish to
save them from the mistakes and perplexities to which
ignorance might in filture expose them. Though perhaps
little native affinity exists between intellectual pursuits
and household cares, they may doubtless be so united as
25 to relieve each other; and she will give strong proof of the
best education and the best regulated mind, who neglects
the fewest duties, and despises none.

AAAINTRODUCTION.
still sensible to an ordinary ear.  This, which is called the czesural
pause, may fall, in English heroic verse, after the fourth, fifth, sixth, or
seventh, syllable in the line. Where the verse is so constructed that
this coesural pause coincides with the slightest pause or division in the
sense, the line can be read easily; as in the two first verses of Pope's
M1essiah:'Ye nymphs of Solyma"! begin the song;
To heavenly-themes" sublimer strains belong.'
But if it should happen that words which have so strict and intimate a
connection as not to bear even a momentary separation are divided from
one another by this cmsural pause, we then feel a sort of struggle between
the sense and the sound, which renders it difficult to read such lines
harmoiiiously. The rule of proper pronunciation in such cases is; to
regard only the pause which the sense forms, and to read the line
accordingly.  The neglect of the cmesural pause may make the line
sound somewhat unharmoniously; but the effect would be much worse,
if the sense were sacrificed to the sound. For instance, in the following
lines of Milton,'What in me is dark,
Illumine; what is low, raise and support,'
the sense clearly dictates the patse after illunmine, at the end of the third
syllable, which, in reading, ought to be made accordingly; though, if
the melody only were to be regarded, illunmine should be connected with
what follows, and the pause not made till the fourth or sixth syllable
So in the following line of Pope's Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot,'I sit, with sad civility I read,'
the ear plainly points out the csesural pause as falling after sad, the fourth
syllable. But it would be very bad reading to male any pause there,
so as to separate sad and civility. The sense admits of no other pause
than after the second syllable, sit, which therefore must be the only pause
made in reading this part of the sentence.
"There is another mode of dividing some verses, by introducing what
mnay be called demi-coesuras, which require very slight pauses; and
which the reader should manage with judgment, or he will be apt to fall
into an affected, sing-song mode of pronouncing verses of this kind. The
following lines exemplify the demi-cmesura.'Warms' in the sun", refreshes' in the breeze,
Glows' in the stars', and blossoms' in the trees:
Lives' through all life"; extends through all extent,
Spreads' undivided", operates' unspent.'
"'Before the conclusion of this introduction, the compiler takes the
liberty to recommend to teachers to exercise their pupils in discovering
and explaining the emphatic words, and the proper tones and pauses,
of every portion assigned them to read, previously to their being called
out to the performance. These preparatory lessons, in which they should
be regularly examined, will improve their judgment and taste, prevent
the practice of reading without attention to the subject, and establish a
habit of readily discovering the meaning, force, and beauty, of everV
sentence they peruse."

Character of Addison as a Wrriter.
As a describer of life and manners, M{[r. Addison must
be allowed to stand perhaps the first in the first rank.
His humor is peculiar to himself; and is so happily diffused, as to give the grace of novelty to domestic scenes
5  and daily occurrences. He never oversteps the modesty
of nature, nor raises merriment or wonder by the violation
of truth. His figures neither divert by distortion, nor
amaze by aggravation. He copies life with so much fidelity, that he can hardly be said to invent; yet his exhi
10 bitions have an air so much original, that it is difficult to
suppose them not merely the product of imagination.
As a teacher of wisdom, he may be confidently followed
His religion has nothing in it enthusiastic or superstitious;
he appears neither weakly credulous nor wantonly skeptic15 al; his morality is neither dangerously lax nor implacably rigid. All the enchantments of fancy, and all the
cogency of argument, are employed to recommend to the
reader his real interest, the care of pleasing the Author
of his being. Truth is shown sometimes as the phantom
20 of a vision, sometimes appears half-veiled in an allegory,
sometimes attracts regard in robes of fancy, and sometimes steps forth in the confidence of reason. She wears
a thousand dresses, and in all is pleasing.
His prose is the model of the middle style; on grave
25 subjects not formal, on light occasions not groveling;
pure without scrupulosity, and exact without apparent
elaboration; always equable, and always easy, without
glowing words or pointed sentences. His page is always
luminous, but never blazes in unexpected splendor.
30   It seems to have been his principal endeavor to avoid
all harshness and severity of diction; he is therefore sometimes verbose in his transitions and connections,and sometimes descends too much to the language of conversation;
yet if his language had' been less idiomatical, it might
35 have lost somewhat of its genuine Anglicism.
What he attempted he performed: he is never feeble,
and he did not wish to be energetic; he is never rapid,
and he never stagnates.  His sentences have neither
studied amplitude nor affected brevity; his periods, though
40 not diligently rounded, are voluble and easy.'Whoever

The moping owl does to the moon complain
Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,
Molest her ancient solitary reign.
15    Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,
Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,
Each in his narrow cell forever laid,
The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.
The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,
20  The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,
The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,
No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.
For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,
Nor busy housewife ply her evening care;
25  No children run to lisp their sire's return,
Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.
Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield;
Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;
How jocund did they drive their team afield!
30  How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke.
Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,
Their homely joys and destiny obscure;
Nor Grandeur hear, with a disdainful smile,
The short and simple annals of the poor.
35    The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
And all that beauty, all that wealth, e'er gave,
Await, alike, the inevitable hour;The paths of glory lead but to the grave.

If memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise,
Where, through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault,
The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.

Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?
Can Honor's voice provoke the silent dust,
Or Flattery soothe the dull, cold ear of death?
Perhaps, in this neglected spot, is laid
10  Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;
Hands that the rod of empire might have swayed,
Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre:
But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,
Rich with the spoils of time, did ne'er unroll;
15  Chill Penury repressed their noble rage,
And froze the genial current of the soul.
Full many a gem, of purest ray serene,
The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear;
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
20  And waste its sweetness on the desert air.
Some village Hampden, that, with dauntless breast,
The little tyrant of his fields withstood;
Some mute, inglorious Milton here may rest;
Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country's blood.

The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,
And read their history in a nation's eyes,
Their lot forbade: nor circumscribed alone
30 Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined;--
Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,
And shut the gates of m'ercy on mankind;
The struggling pangs of conscious Truth to. hide,
To quench the blushes of ingenuous Shame;
35  Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride
With incense kindled at the muse's flame.
Far from the mad'ning crowd's ignoble strife,
Their sober wishes never learned to stray:
Along the cool, sequestered vale of life
40  They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.
Yet even these bones from insult to protect,
Some frail memorial, still erected nigh,
With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture decked
Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

Filial Reverence.
THE present state of manners, though not the best possible, has one advantage over that which preceded it: - it
is more favorable to a confidential intercourse between chil10 dren and parents than was the starched demeanor of our
forefathers; but there might be a much greater infusion
of respect, without any dirninution of confidence.
Filial love, indeed, can never exist in perfection, unless
it be founded on a deep sentiment of reverence; and where
15 that has not been well cultivated in childhood, it is soon
frittered entirely away, by habitual indulgence in disrespect, flippancy, or rude familiarity.
The sentiment of reverence is one of the noblest attributes of the human mind: to its exercise God has affixed
20 an exquisite sense of enjoyment; it operates, in a thousand ways, to elevate and embellish the character. Its
first development is in the feelings of a child for its pa-.
rents; and this is the natural preparation of the mind for
its rise to a higher object, even to the Father in heaven.
25    As the understanding ripens, and this sentiment is cultivated, it embraces all that is great and good among men,
all that is vast and magnificent in nature and in art; shedding over the character of its possessor an indescribable
grace, softening the very tones of the voice, and rendering
30 it impossible for the manners to be wanting in deference
and courtesy towards parents, or teachers, or the aged of
any description.
Where the sentiment of reverence is deficient, a foundation is wanting for many graceful superstructures; and
k5 the defect shows itself in various ways, of which the irreverent are little aware; or thev would endeavor to supply the deficiency, as a mere matter of taste, if not of
principle. Such persons will have unpleasant manners,
Ex. xxII.]

RHETORICAL READING.PARKER'S EXERCISES IN
which no rules of good-breeding will correct; and as the
irreverent state of feeling grows by indulgence in disrespectful demeanor, they are in danger of becoming bold,
reckliess, and even impious.
5    You whom I address are yet young; whatever may
have been your education, you are yet young enough to
reeducate yourselves; you have hearts capable of being
touched by the beautiful, the true, the subliine. You feel
reverence for God and the things that belong to religion;
10 but you have not, perhaps, considered how the same sentiment is connected with other relations in life.
In all the great moral authors whom you have read,
you have found filial piety, and reverence for the aged,
treated as indispensable qualities in a virtuous character,
15 whether heathen or Christian; but you may never have
reflected on the indications which you give of the want
of it in your own. If, then, your conscience tells you
that you are guilty of those faults of manner which I
have described as but too common in our society, you rray
20 be sure that your feelings of reverence need quickening
and cultivating; and if you would escape becoming the
harsh, ungraceful character, which grows out of such delinquency, you must reform your manners.
It is to be feared that some young ladies think them25 selves excused from the duty of filial reverence, becaiuse
they are more highly educated than their parents; they
have more knowledge, more refinement; and therefore
they may dictate, contradict, and set up their judgments
in opposition to their fathers' and mothers'! But this is a
30 great mistake: no superiority of culture can change the
relation of child and parent, or annul the duties that grow
out of it.
The better your education has been, the more cause for
gratitude to those who have procured for you this blessing;
35 the higher the culture, the more you are bound to perform
well all the duties of life; the greater your refinement.
the more perfect should be your manners towards your
parents; the more your influence is needed in the family,
the more important it is that you should not impair it, by
40 such faults as the uneducated can judge of, as well as, the
most cultivated. There is, besides, a great meanness in
turning against your parents the weapons which their
kindness has put into your hands.
The acquirements of their children often make parents
236
[EX. xxIn,feel their own deficiencies very painfully; and nothing but
the most respectful behavior, on the part of the offspring,
can lessen the mortification, and convince them that, apart
from all such adventitious circumstances, they have unde5  niable claims to the love and reverence of their children.
Nothing can justify the want of respect, in the manners
of children to parents, of pupils to teachers, of the young
to the aged; not even faults of character in the individuals
claiming such deference and regard. It is dufe to yourself
10 to treat the relation with respect; and the more perfectly
proper your manners are, the greater will be your influence.
There is nothing, in the whole circle of domestic relations, so lovely, so pure, so honorable to both parties, as
the respectful, affectionate, and confidential intercourse of
15 some young women with their parents. -  rs. Farrar.

The First and the Last Dinner.
TwELVE friends, much about the same age, and fixed by
their pursuits, their family connections, and other local
interests, as permanent inhabitants of the metropolis,
10 agreed, one day, when they were drinking wine at the
Star and Garter at Richmond, to institute an annual dinner among themselves, under the following regulations:
That they should dine alternately at -each others' houses
on the first and last day of the year; and the first bottle
15 of wine uncorked at the first dinner should be recorked
and put away, to be drank by him who should be the last
of their number: that they should never adrmit a new member; that, when one died, eleven should meet, and when
another died ten should meet, and so on; and when only
20 one remained, he should, on these two days, dine by himself, and sit the usual hours at his solitary table; but
the first time he had so dined, lest it should be the only
one, he should then uncork the first bottle, and in the first
glass drink to the memory of all who were gone.
25   Some thirty years had now glided away, and only ten
remained; but the stealing hand of time had written sundry changes in most legible characters. Raven locks had
become grizzled; two or three heads had not as many
locks as may be reckoned in a walk of half a mile along
30 the Regent's Canal; one was actually covered with a
brown wig; the crow's feet were visible in the corner of the
eye; good old port and warm Madeira carried it against
hock, claret, red Burgundy, and champaigne; stews, hashes and ragouts, grew into favor; crusts were rarely called
35 for to relish the cheese after dinner; conversation was less
boisterous, and it turned chiefly upon politics and the state
of the funds, or the value of landed property; apologies
were made for corninag in thick shoes and warm stockings;

the doors and Wxindows were more carefully provided with
list and sand-bags; the fire is in more request; and a quiet
game of whist filled up the hours that were wont to be
devoted to drinking, singing, and riotous merriment.
5   Two rubbers, a cup of coffee, and at -home by eleven
o'clock, was the usual cry, when the fifth or sixth glass
had gone round after the removal of the cloth. At parting,
too, there was now a long ceremony in the hall - buttoning up great coats, tying on woollen comforters, fixing silk
10 handkerchiefs over the mouth and up to the ears, anc
grasping sturdy walking-canes to support unsteady feet.
Their fiftieth anniversary came, and death had indeed
been busy. Four little old men, of withered appearance
and decrepit walk, with cracked voices, and dim, rayless
15 eyes, sat down, by the mercy of Heaven, (as they tremulously declared,) to celebrate, for the fiftieth.time, the first
day of the year--to observe the frolic compact, which,
half a century before, they had entered into at the Star
and Garter at Richmond. Eight were' in their graves  
20 The four that remained stood upon its confines.
Yet they chirped cheerily over their glass, though they
could scarcely carry it to their lips, if more than half full;
and cracked their jokes, though they articulated their
words with difficulty, and heard each other with still
25 greater difficulty. They mumbled, they chattered, they
laughed, (if a sort of strangled wheezing might be called
a laugh,) and as the. wine sent their icy blood in warmer
pulses through their veins, they talked of their past as if
it were but a yesterday that had slipped by them; and of
30 their future as if it were a busy century that lay before
them.
At length came the last dinner; and the survivor of
the twelve, upon whose head fourscore and ten winters
had showered their snow, ate his solitary meal. It so
15 chanced that it was in his house, and at his table, they
celebrated the first. In his cellar, too, had remained, for
more than fifty years, the bottle they had then uncorked,
recorked, and which he was that day to uncork again.
It stood beside him. With a feeble and reluctant grasp,
40 he took the "frail memorial" of a youthful vow, and for a
moment memory wvas faithful to her office. She threw
open the long vista of buried years; and his heart traveled
through them all. Their lusty and blithesome spring, -
their bright and fervid summer, - their ripe and temperate

autumn, - their chill, but not too frozen winter. He saw,
as in a mirror, one by one, the laughing companions of
that merry hour at Richmond had dropped into eternity.
He felt the loneliness of his condition, (for he had eschewed
5 marriage, and in the veins of no living creature ran a drop
of blood whose source was in his own,) and as he drained
the glass which he had filled," to the memory of those
who were gone," the tears slowly trickled down the deep
furrows of his aged face.
10   He had thus fulfilled one part of his vow; and he prepared himself to discharge the other, by sitting the usual
number of hours at his desolate table. With a heavy
heart he resigned himself to the gloom of his own thoughts;
a lethargic sleep stole over him--his head fell upon his
15 bosom-confused images crowded into his mind-he babbled to himself-- was silent - and when his servant entered the room, alarmed by a noise which he heard, he
found his master stretched upon the carpet at the foot of
the easy-chair, out of which he had slipped in an apoplec20 tic fit. He never spoke again, nor once opened his eyes,
though the vital spark was not extinct till the following
day. And this was the last dinner. -Anonynwous.

EXERCISE XXVI1.
Little Paul Dombey's Introduction into a Select Fashionable
School.
DOCTOR BLIDIBER'S establishment was a great hot-house,
in which there was a forcing apparatus incessantly at work.
All the boys blew before their time. No matter what a
young gentleman was intended to bear, Doctor Blimber
15 made him bear to pattern, somehow or other. This was
all very pleasant and ingenious, but the system of forcing
was attended with its usual disadvantages. There was
not the right taste about the premature productions, and
they did n't keep well.
20   The Doctor was a portly gentleman in a suit of black,
with strings at his knees, and stockings below them. He
had a bald head, highly polished; a deep voice; and a
chin so very double, that it was a wonder how he ever
managed to shave into the creases. He had likewise a
25 pair of little eyes that were always half shut up, and a
mouth that was always half expanded into a grin, as if he
had, that moment, posed a boy, and were waiting to convict
him from his own lips.
The Doctor's was a mighty fine house, fronting the sea.
30 Not a joyful style of house within, but quite the contrary.
Sad-colored curtains, whose proportions were spare and
lean, hid themselves despondently behind the windows.
The tables and chairs were put away in rows, like figures
in a sum; fires wove so rarely lighted in the rooms of
35 ceremony, that they felt like wells, and a visitor represented
the bucket; the dining-room seemed the last- place in the
World where any eating or drinking was likely to occur;
244
[EX. XXXVIthere was no sound through all the house but the ticking
of a great clock in the hall, which made itself audible in
the very garrets; and sometimes a dull crying of young
gentlemen at their lessons, like the murmurings of an as5 semblage of melancholy pigeons.
Miss Blimber, too, although a slim and graceful maid,
did no soft violence to the gravity of the house. There
was no light nonsense about Miss Blimber. She kept her
hair short and crisp, and wore spectacles. She was dry
10 and sandy with working in the graves of deceased languages. None of your live languages for Miss Blimber.
They must be dead - stone' dead, -and then Miss Blimber dug them up like a Ghoule.
Mrs. Blimber, her mamma, was not learned herself, but
15 she pretended to be, and that did quite as well. She said
at evening parties, that if she could have known Cicero,
she thought she could have died contented. It was the
steady joy of her life to see the Doctor's young gentlemen
go out walking, unlike all other young gentlemen, in the
20 largest possible shirt collars, and the stiffest possible cravats.
It was so classical, she said..
As to Mr. Feeder, B.A., Doctor Blimber's assistant, he
was a kind of human barrel-organ, with a little list of tunes
at which he was continually working, over and over again,
25 without any variation. He might have been fitted up with
a change of barrels, perhaps, in early life, if his destiny
had been favorable; but it had not been; and he had only
one, with which, in a monotonous round, it was his occupation to bewilder the young ideas of Doctor Blimber's
30 young gentlemen.
The young gentlemen were prematurely full of carking
anxieties. They knew no rest from the pulrsuit of stonyhearted verbs, savage noun-substantives, inflexible syntactic
passages, and ghosts of exercises that appeared to them in
35 their dreams.
Under the forcing system, a young gentleman usually
took leave of his spirits in three weeks. He had all the
cares of the world on his head in three months. He conceived bitter sentiments against his parents or guardians,
40 in four; he was an old misanthrope, in five; envied Quintius Curtius that blessed refuge in the earth, in six; and
at the end of the first twelvemonth had arrived at the conclusion,jom which he never afterwards departed, that all
the fancies of the poets, and lessons of the sages, were a

mere collection of words and grammar, and had no other
meaning in the world. But he went on, blow, blow, blowing, in the Doctor's hot-house, all the time; and the Doctor's
glory and reputation were great, when he took his wintry
5 growth home to his relations and friends.
Upon the Doctor's door-steps, one day, Paul Dombey
stood with a fluttering heart, and with his small right hand
in his father's. " Now, Paul," said Mr. Dombey, exultingly.
" This is the way indeed to be Dombey and Son, and have
10 money. You are almost a man already." --" Almost,"
returned the child. Even his childish agitation could not
master the sly and quaint yet touching look, with which
he accompanied the reply. It brought a vague expression
of dissatisfaction into Mr. Dombey's face; but the door
15 being opened, it was quickly gone.
" Doctor Blimber is at home, I believe? " said Mr. Dombey. The man said yes; and as they passed in, looked
at Paul as if he were a little mouse, and the house were a
trap.
20   The Doctor was sitting in his portentous study, with a
globe at each knee, books all round him, Homer over the
door, and Minerva on the mantel-shell. " And how do you
do, sir," he said to Mr. Dombey, "and how is rmy little
friend?"  Grave as an organ was the Doctor's speech;
25 and when he ceased, the great clock in the hall seemed (to
Paul at least) to take him up, and to go on saying, " how,
is, my, lit, tle, friend, how, is, my, lit, tle, friend," over and
over and over again.
The little friend being something too small to be seen at
30 all from where the Doctor sat, over the books on his table,
the Doctor made several futile attempts to get a view of
him round the legs; which Mr. Dombey perceiving, relieved the Doctor from his embarrassment by taking Paul
up in his artns, and sitting him on another little table over
35 against the Doctor, in the middle of the room.
"Ha!" said the Doctor, leaning back in his chair, with
his hand in his breast. "Now I see my little friend.
How do you do, my little friend?"  The cloclc in the hall
would n't subscribe to this alteration in the form of words,
40 but continued to repeat, "how, is, my, lit, tle, friend, how,
is, my, lit, tle, friend!"  "Very well, I thank you, sir,"
returned. Paul, answering the 9lock quite as much as the
Doctor.
" Ha! " said Dr. Blimber. "Shall we make a man of
246
[EX. XXXVLhim?"-- " Do you hear, Paul," added Mr. Dombey; Paul
being silent. -, Shall we make a man of him? " repeated
the Doctor. --  I had rather be a child," replied Paul.
"Indeed!" said the Doctor. " Why?"
5   The child sat on the table looking at him, with a curious
expression of suppressed emotion in his face, and beating
one hand proudly on his knee, as if he had the rising tears
beneath it, and crushed them. But his other hand strayed
a little way the while, a little further --further from him
10 yet -until it lighted on the neck of Florence. " This is
why," it seemed to say, and then the steady look was
broken up and gone; the working lip was loosened; and
the tears came streaming forth. " Never mind," said the
Doctor, blandly nodding his head. "Ne-ver mind; we
15 shall substitute new cares and new impressions, Mr. Dombey, very shortly. You would still wish my little friend
to acquire- "-; "Everything, if you please, Doctor,"
returned Mr. Dombey, firmly.
"Yes," said the Doctor, who, with his half-shut eyes,
20 and his usual smile, seemed to survey Paul with the sort
of interest that might attach to some choice little animal
he was going to stuff. "Yes, exactly. Ha! We shall
impart a great variety of information to our little friend,
and bring him quickly forward, I dare say. I dare say.
25 Quite a virgin soil, I believe you said, Mr. Dombey?"
" Except some ordinary preparation at home, and from
this lady," replied Mr. Dombey, introducing Mrs. Pipchin,
who instantly communicated a rigidity to her whole muscular system, and snorted defiance beforehand, in case the
30 Doctor should disparage her; " except so far, Paul has, as
yet, applied himself to no studies at all."
Dr. Blimber inclined his head, in gentle tolerance of such
insignificant poaching as Mrs. Pipchin's, and said he was
glad to hear it. It was much more satisfactory, he observed,
35 rubbing his hands, to begin at the foundation. And again
he leered at Paul, as if he would have liked to tackle him
with the Greek alphabet on the spot.
"That circumstance, indeed, Doctor Blimber," pursued
Mr. Dombey, glancing at his little son, " and the interview
40 I have already had the pleasure of holding with you, renders any further explanation, and consequently any further
intrusions on your valuable time, so unnecessary, that-"
"Permf 9e," said the Doctor; " one moment. Allow me
to present Mrs. Blimber and my daughter, who will be

associated with the domestic life of our ycung pilgrim to
Parnassus."
"Mrs. Blimber," for the lady, who had perhaps been in
waiting, opportunely entered, followed by her daughter,
5 that fair Sexton in spectacles, " Mr. Dombey. My daughter Cornelia, Mr. Dombey. Mr. Dombey, my love," pursued the Doctor, turning to his wife, "is so confiding as
to- do you see our little friend?" Mrs. Blimber, in an
excess of politeness, of which Mr. Dombey was the object,
10 apparently did not, for she was backing against the little
friend, and very much endangering his position on the
table. But, on this hint, she turned to admire his classical
and intellectual lineaments, and turning again to Mr.
Domrbey, said, with a sigh, that she envied his dear son.
15   " Like a bee, sir," said Mrs. Blimber, with uplifted eyes,
" about to plunge into a garden of the choicest flowers, and
sip the sweets for the first time. Virgil, Horace, Ovid,
Terence, Plautus, Cicero. What a world of honey have
we here! It may appear remarkable, Mr. Dombey, in one
20 who is a wife - the wife of such a husband -"  " Hush,
hush! " said Doctor Blimber. " Fie, for shame"!  -" Mr.
Dombey will forgive the partiality of a wife," said Mrs.
Blimber, with an engaging smile. Mr. Dombey answered
2' Not at all:" applying those words, it is to be presumed,
25 to the partiality, and not to the forgiveness.
" And it may seem remarkable in one who is a mother,
also," resumed Mlrs. Blimber. --" And such a mother," observed Mr. Dombey, bowing, with some confused idea of
being complimentary to Cornelia. -" But really," pursued
d0 Mrs. Blirnber, "I think if I could have known Cicero, and
been his friend, and talked with him in his retirement at
Tusculum, (beau-ti-ful Tusculum!) I could have died contented."
A learned enthusiasm is so very contagious, that Mr..35 Dombey half believed that this was exactly his case; and
even Mrs. Pipchin, who was not, as we have seen, of an
accommodating disposition' generally, gave utterance to a
little sound between a groan and a sigh, as if she would
have said that nobody but Cicero could have proved a last40 ing consolation under that failure of the Peruvian mines,
but that he indeed would have been a very Davy-lamp of
refuge.
Cornelia looked at Mr. Dombey through hfi'spectacles,
as if she would have liked to crack a few qu6tations with
248
[EX. XXXVI.him from the authority in question. But this design, if
she entertained it, was frustrated by a knock at the roomdoor. "Who is that?" said the Doctor. " Oh\! come in,
Toots; come in.   Mr. Dombey, sir."  Toots bowed.
5 "Quite a coincidence!" said Doctor Blimber. "Here we
have the beginning and the-, end, Alpha and Omega.
Our head boy, Mr. Dombey."  
The Doctor might have called him their head and
shoulders boy, for he was at least that much taller than
10 any of the rest. He blushed very much at finding himself
among strangers, and chuckled aloud. "An addition to
our little Portico, Toots," said the Doctor; " Mr. Dombey's
son." Young Toots blushed again; and finding, firom a
solemn silence which prevailed, that he was expected to
15 say something, said to Paul, " How are you? " in a voice
so deep, and a manner so sheepish, that if a lamb had
roared it could n't have been more surprising.
" Ask Mr. Feeder, if you please, Toots," said the Doctor,
"to prepare a few introductory volumes for Mr. Dombey's
20 son, and to allot him a convenient seat for study. My dear,
I believe Mr. Dombey has not seen the dormitories."--" If
Mr. Dombey will walk up stairs," said Mrs. Blimber, " I
shall be more than proud to show him the dominions of
the drowsy god." With that, Mrs. Blimber, who was a
25 lady of great suavity, and a wiry figure, and who wore a
cap composed of sky-blue materials, proceeded up stairs
with Mr. Dombey and Cornelia.
While they were gone, Paul sat upon the table, holding
Florence by the hand, and glancing timidly from the Doc30 tor round and round the room, while the Doctor, leaning
bacl in his chair, with his hand in his breast as usual, held
a book from him at arm's length, and read. There was
something very awful in this manner of reading. It was
such a determined, unimpassioned, inflexible, cold-blooded
35 way of going to work. It left the Doctor's countenance
exposed to view; and when the Doctor smiled auspiciously
at his author, or knit his brows, or shook his head and
made wry faces at him, as much as to say, " Don't tell me,
sir! I know better," it was terrific.
40   Toots, too, had no business to be outside the door, ostentatiously examining the wheels in his watch, and counting
his half-crowns. But that did n't last long; for Dr. Blimber h i ening to change the position of his tight plump
legs,  f he were going to get up, Toots swiftly vanished,

and appeared no more. Mr. Dombey and his conductress
were soon heard coming down stairs again, talking all the
way; and presently they reentered the Doctor's study.
"I hope, Mr. Dombey," said the Doctor, laying down
5  his book, " that the arrangements meet your approval." -
" They are excellent, sir," said Mr. Dombey. " I think
I have now given all the trouble I need, and may take
my leave. Paul, my child," - he went close to him as he
sat upon the table. "Good-bye."--" Good-bye, papa."
10   "I shall see you soon, Paul. You are free on Saturdays and Sundays, you know." -" Yes, papa," returned
Paul, looking at his sister. "On Saturdays and Sundays." -" And you'11 try and learn a great deal here, and
be a clever man," said Mr. Dombey; "won't you? "--" I'11
15 try," returned the child, wearily. - " And you'11 soon be
grown up, now! " said Mr. Dombey. -" Oh! very soon! "
replied the child.
After patting him on the head, and pressing his small
hand again, Mr. Dombey took leave of Dr. Blimber, Mrs.
20 Blimber, and Miss Blimber, with his usual polite frigidity,
and walked out of the study.
Despite his entreaty that they would not thinlr of stirring, Doctor Blimber, Mrs. Blimber, and Miss Blimber all
pressed forward to attend him to the hall; and thus Mrs.
25 Pipchin got into a state of entanglement with Miss Blimber and the Doctor, and was crowded out of the study
before she could clutch Florence. To which happy accident Paul stood afterwards indebted for the dear remembrance, that Florence ran back to throw her arms round't0 his neck, and that hers was the last face in the doorway:
turned towards him with a smile of encouragement the
brighter for the tears through which it beamed.
It made his childish bosom heave and swell when it
was gone, and sent the globes, the books, blind Homer, and
35 Minerva, swimming round the room. But they stopped,
all of a sudden; and then he heard the loud clock in the
hall still gravely inquiring, "how, is, my, lit, tle, friend,
how, is, my, lit, tle, friend," as it had done before. He
sat, with folded hands, upon his pedestal, silently listening.
40 But he might have answered, " weary, weary! very lonely, very sad."  And there, with an aching void in his
young heart, and all outside so c-old, and bare, and strange,
Paul sat as if he had taken life unfurnished, apnd the upholsterer were never coming.

EXERCISE XXXVII.
Same Subject, continued. - The Dinner Hour.
DOCTOR BLIMBER was already in his place in the diningroom, at the top of the table, with Miss Blimber and Mrs.
Blimber on either side of him. Mr. Feeder, in a black
coat, was at the bottom. Paul's chair was next to Miss
5  Blimber; but it being found, when he sat in it, that his
eyebrows were not much above the level of the table-cloth,
some books were brought in from the Doctor's study, on
which he was elevated, and on which he always sat from
that time - carrying them in and out himself on after
10 occasions, like a little elephant and castle.
Grace having been said by the Doctor, dinner began.
There'was some nice soup; also roast meat, boiled meat,
vegetables, pie, and cheese. Every young gentleman had
a massive silver fork, and a napkin; and all the arrange15 ments were stately and handsome. In particular, there
was a butler in a blue coat and bright buttons, who gave
quite a winy flavor to the table beer; he poured it out so
superbly.
Nobody spoke, unless spoken to, except Dr. Blimber,
20 Mrs. Blimber, and Miss Blimber, who conversed occasionally. Whenever a young gentleman was not actually
engaged with his knife and fork or spoon, his eye, with
an irresistible attraction, sought the eye of Dr. Blimber,
Mrs. Blimber, or Miss Blimber, and modestly rested there.
25 Toots appeared to be the only exception to this rule. He
sat next Mr. Feeder on Paul's side of the table, and frequently looked behind and before the intervening boys to
catch a glimpse of Paul.
Only once during dinner was there any conversation
30 that included the young gentlemen. It happened at the
epoch of the cheese, when the Doctor, having taken a
glass of port wine, and hemmed twice or thrice, said:
"It is remarkable, Mr. Feeder, that the Romans--"
At the mention of this terrible people, their implacable
35 enemies, every young gentleman fastened his gaze upon
the Doctor, with an assumption of the deepest interest.
One of the number, who happened to be drinking, and who
caught the Doctor's eye glaring at him through the side
of his tumbler, left off so hastily that he was convulsed
40 for soeq,moments, and in the sequel ruined Dr. Blimber's
point.

"It is remarkable, Mar. Feeder," said the Doctor, begin.
ning again slowly, " that the Romans, in those gorgeous
and profuse entertainments of which we read in the days
of the emperors, when luxury had attained a height un5  known before or since, and when whole provinces were
ravaged to supply the splendid means of one imperial
banquet--" Here the offender, who had been swelling
and straining, and waiting in vain for a full stop, broke
out violently.
10   " Johnson," said Mr. Feeder, in a low, reproachful voice,
" take some water."  The Doctor, looking very stern,
made a pause until the water was brought, and then resumed:-" And when, Mr. Feeder -"   But Mr. Feeder,
who saw that Johnson must break out again, and who
15 knew that the Doctor would never come to a period before the young gentlemen until he had finished all he
meant to say, couldn't keep his eyes off Johnson; and
thus was caught in the fact of not looking at the Doctor,
who consequently stopped.
20   "I beg your pardon, sir," said Mr. Feeder, reddening.
"I beg your pardon, Doctor Blimber." --" And when,"
said the Doctor, raising his voice, " when, sir, as we read,
and have no reason to doubt - incredible as it may appear to the vulgar of our time- the brother of Vitellius
25 prepared for him a feast, in which were served, of fish
two thousand dishes - "-" Take some water, Johnson -
dishes, sir," said Mr. Feeder.  " Of various sorts of fowl
five thousand dishes," -" Or try a crust of bread," said
M[r. Feeder.30   " And one dish," pursued Doctor Blimber, raising his
voice still higher, as he looked all round the table, " called,
from its enormous dimensions, the Shield of 3[Minerva,
and made, among other costly ingredients, of the brains
of pheasants -"--" Ow, ow, ow!" (from Johnson.)-,25 " Woodcocks," -" Ow, ow, ow! " -  The sounds of the
fish called scari," -" You'11 burst some vessel in your
head," said Mr. Feeder. " You had better let it come.""And the spawn of the lamprey, brought from the
Carpathian Sea," pursued the Doctor, in his severest voice;
40 "when we read of costly entertainments such as these,
and still remember that we have a Titus,"--  What would
be your mother's feelings if you died of apoplexy? " said
Mr. Feeder. -" A Domitian,"--" And you're blue, you
know," said Mr. Feeder. -  A Nero, a Tiberius, a Cali252
[EX. XXXVIIRHETORICAL READ1NG.
gula, a Heliogabalus, and many more," pursued the Doc
tor; "' it is, Mr. Feeder-- if -you are doing me the honor
to attend - remarkable; very remarkable, sir -"
But Johnson, unable to suppress it any longer, burst
5 at that moment into such an overwhelming fit of coughing, that, although both his immediate neighbors thumped
him on the back, and Mr. Feeder himself held a glass of
water to his lips, and the butler walked him up and down
several times between his own chair and the sideboard,
10 like a sentry, it was full five minutes before he was moderately composed. Then there was a profound silence.
"Gentlemen" said Doctor Blimber, "rise for grace!
Cornelia, lift Dombey down," - nothing of whom but his
scalp was accordingly seen above the table-cloth. "John15 son will repeat to me to-morrow morning, before breakfast,
without book, and from the Greek Testament, the first
epistle of Saint Paul to the Ephesians. We will resume
our studies, Mr. Feeder, in half an hour."
The young gentlemen bowed and withdrew. Mr. Feed20 er did likewise. During the half hour, the young gentlemen, broken into pairs, loitered arm-in-arm up and down
a small piece of ground behind the house, or endeavored
to kindle a spark of animation in the breast of Briggs.
But nothing happened so vulgar as play. Punctually at
25 the appointed time, the gong was sounded, and the studies,
under the joint auspices of Doctor Blimber and Mr. Feeder, were resumed.
As the Olympic game of lounging up and down had
been cut shorter than usual that day, on Johnson's ac30 count, they all went out for a walk before tea. Even
Briggs (though he had n't begun yet) partook of this dissipation; in the enjoyment of which he looked over the
cliff two or three times darkly. Doctor Blimber accompanied them; and Paul had the honor of being taken in
35 tow bv the Doctor himself; a distinguished state of things,
in which he looked very little and feeble.
Tea was served in a style no less polite than the dinner;
and after tea, the young gentlemen; rising and bowing as
before, withdrew to fetch up the unfinished tasks of that day,
40 or to get up the already looming tasks of to-morrow. In the
mean time Mr. Feeder withdrew to his own room; and Paul
sat in a corner, wondering whether Florence was thinking
of him, and what they were all about at Mrs. Pipchin's.
At sIght o'clock or so, the gong sounded again for

prayers in the dining-room, where the butler afterwards
presided over a side table, on which bread and cheese and
beer were spread for such young gentlemen as desired to
partake of those refreshments. The ceremonies concluded
5 by the Doctor's saying, "Gentlemen, we will resume our
studies at seven to-morrow;" and then, for the first time,
Paul saw Cornelia Blimber's eye, and saw that it was upon
him. When the Doctor had said these words, "Gentlemen, we will resume our studies at seven to-morrow," the
10 pupils bowed again and went to bed. - Dickens.

Facetious History of John Gilpin.
JOHN GILPIN was a citizen of credit and renown;
A train-band captain eke was he, of famous London town.  [been
John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear -"' Though wedded we have
IThese twice ten tedious years, yet we no holiday have seen.
35' To-morrow is our wedding-day, and we shall then repair
Unto the Bell at Edmonton, all in a chaise and pair.
My sister and my sister's child, myself and children three,
Will fill the chaise; so you must ride on horseback after we."
He soon replied, -" I do admire of woman-kind but one;
40 And you are she, my dearest dear, therefore it shall be done.
I am a linen draper bold, as all the world doth know;
And my good friend, Tom Calender, will lend his horse to go."Quoth Mlrs. Gilpin, -- "That's well said, and, for that wine is dear,
We will be furnished with our own, which is so bright and clear.
John Gilpin kissed his loving wife; o'erjoyed was he to find,
That, though on pleasure she was bent, she had a frugal mind.
5   The morning came, the chaise was brought, but yet was not allowe(l
To drive up to the door, lest all should say that she was proud.
So three doors off the chaise was staid, where they did all get in -
Six precious souls; and all agog to dash through thick and thin.
Smack went the whip, round went the wheels, were never folks so
10       glad;
The stones did rattle underneath, as if Cheapside were mad.
John Gilpin, at his horse's side, seized fast the flowing mane,
And up he got in haste to ride, but soon came down again.
For saddle-tree scarce reached had he, his journey to begin,
15 When, turning round his face, he saw three customers come in.
So down he came; for loss of timne, although it grieved him sore,
Yet loss of pence, full well he knew, would grieve him still much
more.'T was long before the customers were suited to their mind,
20 When Betty screamed into his ears - "The wine is left behind!"
" Good lack! " quoth he; " yet bringit me; my leathern belt likewise,
In which I bear my trusty sword when I do exercise."
Now Mrs. Gilpin - careful soul - had two stone bottles found,
To hold the liquor which she loved, and keep it safe and sound.
25 Each bottle had two curling ears, through which the belt he drew;
He hung one bottle on each side, to make his balance true.
Then, over all, that he might be equipped from top to toe,
His long red cloak, well brushed and neat, he manfully did throw.
Now see him moilnted once again upon his nimble steed,
30 Full slowly pacing o'er the stones, with caution and good heed.
But, finding soon a smoother roa I beneath his well-shod feet,
The snorting beast began to trot, which galled him in his seat.
So "fair and softly," John did cry, but John he cried in vain;
The trot became a gallop soon, in spite of curb or rein.
35   So stooping down, as he needs must who cannot sit upright,
He grasped. the mane with both his hands, and eke with all his might.
Away went Gilpin, neck or nought, away went hat and wig;
He little dreamt, when he set out, of running such a rig.
The horse, who never had before been handled in this kind,
40 Affrighted fled; and, as he flew, left all the world behind.
The wind did blow, the cloak did fly, like streamers long and gay;
Till loop and button failing both, at last it flew away.
Then might all people well discern the bottles he had slung;
A bottle swinging at each side, as has been said or sun,g.
45 The dogs. did bark, the children screamed, up flew the windows all;
And every soul cried out, "Well done! " as loud as they could bawl.
Away went Gilpin- who but he? his fame soon spread around -
" He carries weight! - he rides a race! -'t is for a thousand pound."
And still as fast as he drew near,'t was wonderful to view,
50 How, in a trice, the turnpike men their gates wide open threw.
And now as he went bowing down his reeking head full low,
The bottles twain behind his back, were shattered at a blow.
Down ranl the wine into the road, most piteous to be seen,
And made his horse's flanks to smoke, as he had basted been.
256
PARKER IS EXERCISES IN.
LEX. xL.But still he seemed to carry weight, with leathern girdle braced;
For still the bottle necks were left, both dangling at his waist.
Thus all through merry Islington those gambols he did playAnd till he came unto the wash of Edmonton so gay.
5   And there he threw the wash about on both sides of the way,
Just like unto a trundling mop, or a wild goose at play.
At Edmonton, his loving wife, from the balcony, spied
Her tender husband, wondering much to see how he did ride.
" Stop, stop, John Gilpin, here's the house!" they all at once did cry;
10 " The dinner waits, and we are tired! " Said Gilpin, - " So am'I!'
But ah, his horse was not a whit inclined to tarry there:
For why?- his owner had a house full ten miles off, at Ware.
So like an arrow swift he flew, shot by an archer strong;
So he did fly-which brings me to the middle of my song.
15 Away went Gilpin out of breath, and sore against his will,
Till at his friend's, Tom Calender's, his horse at last stood still.
Tom Calender, surprised to see his friend in such a trim,
Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate, and thus accosted him:
"What news, what news? -the tidings tell; make haste and tell
20       me all!
Say, why bare-headed are you come, or why you come at all?  
Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit, and loved a timely joke;
And thus unto Tom Calender in merry strains he spoke: -
" I come because your horse would come; and if I well forbode,
25 MZy hat and wig will soon be here, they are upon the road."
Tom Calender, right glad to find his friend in merry pin,
Returned him not a single word, but to the house went in.  [hind,
Whence straight he came with hat and wig, - a wig that drooped be
A hat not much the worse for wear; each comely in its kind.
30   He held them up, and, in his turn, thus showed his ready wit:--
"My head is twice as big as yours, they therefore needs must fit
But let me scrape the dirt away that hangs about your face;
And stop and eat -for well you may be in a hungry case! "
Said John -  It is my wedding-day; and folks would gape and
35       stare,
If wife should dine at Edmonton, and I should dine at Ware."
Then speaking to his horse, he said, " I am in haste to dine;'T was for your pleasure you came here, you shall go back for mine."
Ah! luckless word, and bootless boast, fobr which he paid full dear;
40 For, while he spoke, a braying ass did sing most loud and clearWhereat his horse did snort, as if he heard a lion roar;
And galloped off with all his might, as he had done before.
Away went Gilpin -and away went Gilpin's hat and wig;
He lost them sooner than at first: for why? -they were too big.
45 Now Gilpin's wife, when she had seen her husband posting down
Into the country far away, she pulled out half a crown;
And thus unto the youth she said that drove them to the Bell,
" This shall be yours, when you back bring my husband safe and well."
The youth did ride, and soon they met; he tried to stop John's horse,
50 By seizing fast the flowing rein; but only made things worse:
For, not performing what he meant, and gladly would have done;
He thereby frighted Gilpin's horse, and made him faster run.
Away went Gilpin- and away went post-boy at his heels;
rhe post-boy's horse right glad to miss the lumber of the wheels.

Six gentlemen upon the road, thus seeing Gilpin fly,
With post-boy scampering in the rear, they raised the hue-and-cry.
" Stop thief! - stop thief! - a highwayman! " not one of them was
mute,
5 So they, and all that passed that way, soon joined in the pursuit.
But all the turnpike gates again flew open in short space;
The men still thinking, as before, that Gilpin rode a race:
And so he did, and won it, too; for he got first to town;
Nor stopped till where he first got up he did again get down.

EXERCISE XLI.
The Departure of the Gypszesfrom Ellangowan.
IT was in a hollow way, near the top of a steep ascent
upon the verge of the Ellangowan estate, that Mr. Bertram
met the gypsy. procession.  Four or five men formed
15 the advanced guard, wrapped in long, loose great coats,
that hid their tall, slender figures, as the large slouched
hats, drawn over their brows, concealed their wild features,
dark eyes, and swarthy faces. Two of them carried long
fowling-pieces, one wore a broad-sword without a sheath,
20 and all had the Highland dirk, though they did not wear
that weapon openly or ostentatiously.
Behind them followed the train of laden asses, and small. carts, or tumblers, as they were called in that country, on
which were laid the decrepit and the helpless, the aged
25 and infant part of the exiled community.  The women in
their red cloaks and straw hats, the elder children with
bare heads and bare feet, and almost naked bodies, had the
immediate care of the little caravan. The road was narrow, running between two broken banks of sand, and Mr.
30 Bertram's servant rode forward, smacking his whip with an
air of authority, and motioning to their drivers to allow
free passage to their betters.
His signal was unattended to. He then called to the
men who lounged idly on before, " Stand to your beasts'
35 heads, and make room for the laird to pass." -" He shall
have his share of the road," answered a male gypsy from
under his slouched and large-brimmed hat, and without
raising his face, "and he shall have no more; the highway is as free to our cuddies as to his geldings."
40    The tone of the man being sulky, and even menacing,
258
[EX. XLI.Mr. Bertram thought it best to put his dignity into his
pocket, and pass by the procession quietly, upon such space
as they chose to leave for his accommodation, which was
narrow enough. To cover with an appearance of indif5 ference his feeling of the want of respect with which he
was treated, he addressed one of the men, as he passed
him, without any show of greeting, salute, or recognition,
--"Giles Baillie," he said, "have you heard that your
son Gabriel is well?" (the question respecting the young
10 man who had been pressed.)
" If I had heard otherwise," said the old man, looking
up with a stern and menacing countenance, "you should
have heard it too." And he plodded his way, tarrying no
further question. When the laird had pressed onward
15 with difficulty among a crowd of familiar faces, - in which
he now only read hatred and contempt, but which had on
all former occasions marked his approach with the reverence due to that of a superior being, - and had got clear of
the throng, he could not help turning his horse and looking
20 back to mark the progress of the march. The group
would have been an excellent subject for the pencil of
Colotte. The van had already reached a small and
stunted thicket, which was at the bottom of the hill, and
which gradually hid the line of march until the last strag25 glers disappeared.
His sensations were bitter enough. The race, it is true,
which he had thus summarily dismissed from their ancient
place of refuge, was idle and vicious; but had he endeavored to render them otherwise? They were not more
30 irregular characters now than they had been while they
were admitted to consider themselves as a sort of subordinate dependants of his family; and ought the circumstance of his becoming a magistrate to have made at once
such a change in his conduct towards them? Some means
35 of reformation ought at least to have been tried, before sending seven families at once upon the wide world, and depriving them of a degree of countenance which withheld
them at least from atrocious guilt.
There was also a natural yearning of heart upon parting
40 with so many known and familiar faces; and to this feeling Godfrey Bertram was peculiarly accessible, from the
limited qualities of his mind, which sought its principal
amusements among the petty objects around him.
As he was about to turn his horse's head to pursue his

--journey, Meg Merrilies, who had lagged behind the trQops,
unexpectedly presented herself. She was standing upon one
of those high banks, which, as we before noticed, overhung
the road; so that she was placed considerably higher than
5 Ellangowan, even thou(h he was on horseback; and her
tall figure, relieved against the clear blue sky, seemed
almost of supernatural height. We have noticed that
there was in her general attire, or rather in her mode of
adjusting it, somewhat of a foreign costume, artfully adopt10 ed, perhaps, for the purpose of adding to the effect of her
spells and predictions, or perhaps from some traditional
notions respecting the dress of her ancestors. On this
occasion, she had a large piece of red cotton cloth rolled
about her head in the form of a turban, from beneath which
15 her dark eyes flashed with uncommon luster.
Her long and tangled black hair fell in elf locks from
the folds of this singular head gear. Her attitude was that
of a sybil in frenzy, as she stretched out, in her right hand,
a sapling bough which seemed just pulled. " I'11 be sworn,"
20 said the groom, " she has been cutting the young ashes in
the Dukit Park." The laird made no answer, but continued to look at the figure which was thus perched above his
path.
"Ride your ways," said the gypsy, " ride your ways,

lMerrilies speak, and this is the last reise that I'11 ever cut

So saying, she broke the sapling she held in her hand,
5 and flung it into the road. Margaret of Anjou, bestowing
on her triumphant foes her keen-edged malediction, could
not have turned from them with a gesture more proudly
contemptuous. The laird was clearing his voice to speak,
and thrusting his hand in his pocket to find half a crown;
10 the gypsy waited neither for his reply nor his donation,
but strode down the hill to overtake the caravan.
Ellangowan rode pensively home; and it was remarkable that he did not mention this interview lo any of his
family. The groonm was not so reserved: he told the story
15 at great length to a full audience in the kitchen, and concluded by swearing, that " if ever the devil spoke by the
mouth of a woman, he had spolcen by that of Meg Merrilies that blessed day."- Sir Walter Scott.

Address oJ the Mlassachusetts Legislature, Feb. 1797, to
George Washington, President of t/he United States, on
his retiring from office.
SIR,-- As you have announced to the people of the
United States vour intention to retire from the cares and
decline the honors of public life, the Legislature of Massachusetts deem it a becoming duty, to express their sen5 timents, and those of their constituents, on this interesting
event.
It is not an opinion that our public testimony of your
merits can be necessary to the luster of your reputation,
or the serenity of your repose, which prompts us to join
10 the general voice of America' in applauding your great
and glorious services; but we are excited to this measure
by a wish to exhibit a powerful inducement to the love of
our country, and to transmit to future times a record of the
gratitude of our republic.
15   As the able and heroic general, who led our armies to
victory and- our countrv to independence, or as an enlightened and patriotic magistrate, under whose administration
the United States have enjoyed peace and prosperity, your
conduct has furnished a great and brilliant example of in20 tegrity, fortitude, and wisdom.
We trust that the pacific system which you have pursued with regard to the foreign relations of the country
will be as completely justified by its eventual success, as
it is by the maxims of equity and prudence; and we in25 dulge the hope, that this system will not be discontinued,
and that its beneficial effects wili not be confinred to America, but will tend to discredit, among the nations of the
world, that false and barbarous policy which sacrifices the
public good at the shrine of resentment and ambition.
30    When this effect shall take place, the cause of humanity will have derived a precious advantage from the example you have given, that moderation is the basis of true
dignity, and that those laurels which are reared in sunshine and peace are beyond comparison fairer than those
35 which are fertilized by the tears and blood of a people.
We receive your address to your fellow-citizens, upon
the occasion of your intended retirement from your civil
situation, with the same sentiments of respect and emotions of gratitude which' were inspired by that which
EX. XLI.], 263PARKER'S EXERCISES IN
terminated your military career; sensible that it discloses
an intelligent view of their political interests, and discovers that affectionate zeal for their future welfare which
marks the character of their common friend.
5   Whilst, in behalf of our country, we lament the necessity which deprlves her of your services in public life, we
cannot deny that so many years of anxious toil for her
interests give you the best title to that repose which you
have long so ardently wished to enjoy.
10   You will retire, covered with glory and followed with
the blessings of your fellow-citizens;- whose honor and
happiness it will be, that whilst you have deserved well of
your country, that country has never ceased to cherish a
grateful and admiring sense of your worth.
15   Our fervent prayers for your health and enjoyment will
go with you into the retreats of private life; may you live
to be full of years, and satisfied with beholding the prosperity of your country; and when you shall be called from
the present scene, may that beneficent Being, who has
20 made you the happy instrument of so much good to mankind, admit you to those rewards, in a future state, which
this world cannot bestow.

sentiments as honorable to them as to me, - have excited
the most grateful emotions. Whatever services I have
rendered to my country, in its general approbation I have
received an ample reward. Having nothing -in view but
30 to vindicate its rights, secure its liberty, and promote its
happiness., I might expect the Inost efficient aid and support in the exertions of able and upright men, and in the
general spirit-of my fellow-citizens. All this I have experienced, and our united efforts have resulted in ouI
35 independence, peace. and prosperity. And I entertain the
264
[EX. XLIII.RHETORICAL READING.,
pleasing hope, that the intelligence and superior information of mv fellow-citizens, enabling them. to discern their
true interests, will lead them to the successive choice of
wise and virtuous men to watch over, protect and promote
5  them, who, while they pursue those maxims of moderation, equity and prudence, which will entitle our country
to perpetual peace, will cultivate that fortitude and dignity
of sentiment which are essential to the maintenance of
our liberty and independence.
10   Should it please God, according to the prayers of your
constituents, to grant me health and long life, my greatest
enjoyment will be to behold the prosperity of my country;
and the affection and attachment of my fellow-citizens,
through the whole period of my public employments, will
15 be the subject of my most agreeable recollections: - while
a belief, which the affecting sentiments of the people of
Massachusetts, expressed by their Senate and House of
Representatives, with those of my fellow-citizens in general, have inspired, that I have been the happy instrument
20 of much good to my country and to mankind, will be a
source of unceasing gratitude to Heaven.

Descends the billowy foam: now is the time,

Convulsive twist in agonizing folds;

Then, issuing cheerful, to thy sport repair;
Chief should the western breezes curling play,
And light o'er ether bear the shadowy clouds.
High to their fount, this day, amid the hills,
5  And woodlands warbling round, trace up the brooks  
The next, pursue their rocky-channeled maze
Down to the river, in whose ample wave
Their little naiads love to sport at large.
Just in the dubious point, where with the pool
10 Is mixed the trembling stream, or where it boils
Around the stone, or from the hollowed banl
Reverted plays in undulating flow,
There throw, nice judging, the delusive fly;
And, as you lead it round in artful curve,
1.5 With eye attentive mark the springing game.
Straight as above the surface of the flood
They wanton rise, or, urged by hunger, leap,
Then fix, with gentle twitch, the barbed hook;
Some lightly tossing to the grassy bank,'
20  And to the shelving shore slow dragging some,
With various lland proportioned to their force.
If yet too young, and easily deceived,
A worthless prey scarce bends your pliant rod,
Him, piteous of his youth and the short space
25  He has enjoyed the vital'light of heaven,
Soft disengage, and back into the stream
The speckled captive throw. But should you lure
From his dark haunt, beneath the tangled roots
Of pendant trees, the monarch of the brook,
30  Behoves you then to ply your finest art.
Long time he, following cautious, scans the fly;
And oft attempts to seize it, but as oft
The dimpled water speaks his jealous fear.
At last, while haply o'er the shaded sun
35  Passes a cloud, he desperate takes the death,
With sullen plunge. At once he darts along,
Deep struck, and runs out all the lengthened line:
Then seeks the furthest ooze, the sheltering weed,
The caverned bank, his old secure abode;
40  And flies aloft, and flounces round the pool,
Indignant of the guile.

That feels him still, yet to his furious course

EXERCISE XLV.
On Contentment.
5   CONTENTMENT produces, in some measure, all those effects which the alchemist usually ascribes to what he calls
the philosopher's stone; and if it does not bring riches, it
does the same thing, by banishing the desire of them. If
it cannot remove the disquietudes arising out of a man's
10 mind, body, or fortune, it nmakes him easy under them,
It has, indeed, a kindly influence on the soul of man, in
respect of every being to whom he stands related.
It extinguishes all murmur, repining and ingratitude,
towards that Being who has allotted him his part to act
15 in this world. It destroys all inordinate ambition, and
every tendency to corruption, with regard to the community wherein he is placed. It gives sweetness to his conversation, and a perpetual serenity to all his thoughts.
Among the many methods which might be made use of
20 for the acquiring of this virtue, I shall only mention the
two following. First of all, a man should always consider how much he has more than he wants; and secondly,
howv much more unhappy he might be than he really is.
First of all, a man should always consider how much
25 he has more than he wants. 1 am wonderfully pleased
with the reply which Aristippus made to one who condoled with him upon the loss of a farm: "Why," said
he, "I have three farms still, and you have but one; so
that I ought rather to be afflicted for you than you for
30 me."  On the contrary, foolish men are more apt to consider what they have lost than what they possess; and
to fix their eyes upon those who are richer than themselves, rather than on those who are under greater difficulties.
35   All the real pleasures and conveniences of life lie in a
narrow compass; but it is the humor of mankind to be
always looking forward, and straining after one -who has
got the start of' them in wealth -and honor. For this
267
tx. XLV.]
RHETORICAL READING.PARKER'S EXERCISES IN
reason, as none can be properly called rich who have not
more than they want, there are few rich men, in any of
the politer nations, but among the middle sort of people,
who keep their wishes within their fortunes, and have
5 more wealth than they know how to enjoy. Persons of
a higher rank live in a kind of splendid poverty; and are
perpetually wanting, because, instead of acquiescing in the
solid pleasures of life, they endeavor to outvie one another
in shadows and appearances.
10 MiVen of sense have at all times beheld with a great
deal of mirth this silly game that is playing over their
heads; and, by contracting their desires, they enjoy all
that secret satisfaction which others are always in quest
of. The truth is, this ridiculous chase after imaginary
15 pleasures cannot be sufficiently exposed, as it is the great
source of those evils which generally undo a nation. Let
a man's estate be what it may, he is a poor man if he
does not live within it; and naturally sets himself to sale
to any one who can give him his price.
20   When Pittacus, after the death of his brother, who had
left him a good estate, was offered a great sum of money
by the King of Lydia, he thanked him for his kindness,
but told him he had already more by half than he knew
what to do with. In short, content is equivalent to wealth,
25 and luxury to poverty; or, to give the thought a more
agreeable turn, "Content is natural wealth," says Socrates;
to which I shall add, Luxury is artificial poverty.
I shall therefore recornnmend to the consideration of
those who are always aiming at superfluous and imagin30 ary enjoyments, and who will not be at the trouble of contractiung their desires, an excellent saying of Bion the philosopher, namely,," That no man has so much care as he
who endeavors after the most happiness."
In the second place, every one ought to reflect how
35 much more unhappy he might be than he really is. The
former consideration took in all those who are sufficiently
provided with the means to make themselves easy; this
regards such as actually lie under some pressure or misfortune. These may receive great alleviation from such a
40 comparison as the unhappy person may make between
himself and others: or between the misfortune which he
suffers, and greate, misfortunes which might have befallen
him.
I like the story of the honest Dutchman, who, upon
[EX. XLV.
26Sbreaking his leg by a fall from the mainmast, told the
standers by it was a great mercy that it was not his neck.
To which, since I am got into quotations, give me leave to
add the saying of an old philosopher, who, after having
5 invited some of his friends to dine with him, was ruffled
by a person that came into the room in a passion, and
threw down the table that stood before them: "Every
one," says he, " has his calamity; and he is a happy man
that has no greater than this."
10   We find an instance to the same purpose in the life of
Doctor Hammond, written by Bishop Fell. As this good
man was troubled with a complication of distempers, when
he had the gout upon him, he used to thank God that it
was not the stone; and when he had the stone, that he had
15 not both these distempers on him at the same time.
I cannot conclude this essay without observing, that
there never was any system, besides that of Christianity,
which could effectually produce in the mind of man the
virtue I have been hitherto speaking of.
20   in order to make us contented with our condition, many
of the present philosophers tell us that our discontent only
hurts ourselves, without being able to make any alteration
in our circumstances; others, that whatever evil befalls us
is derived to us by a fatal necessity. to which superior
25 beings themselves are subject; while others very gravely
tell the man who is miserable that it is necessary he
should be so, to keep up the harmony of the universe; and
that the scheme of Providence would be troubled and perverted were he otherwise.
30   These, and the like considerations, rather silence than
satisfy a man. They may show him that his discontent
is unreasonable, but they are by no means sufficient to
relieve it. They rather give despair than consolation. In
a word, a man might reply to one of these comforters, as
3^5 Augustus did to his friend who advised him not to grieve

How light was thy heart till love's witchery came,

Her dark flowing hair for some festival day,

The Hill of Science.
IN that season of the year, when the serenity of the sky,
the various fruits which cover the ground, the discolored
foliage of the trees, and all the sweet but fading graces
of inspiring autumn, open the mind to benevolence, and
5 dispose it for contemplation, I was wandering in a beautiful and romantic country, till curiosity began to give way
to weariness; and I sat down on the fragment of a rock
overgrown with moss, where the rustling of the falling
leaves, the dashing of waters, and the hum of the distant
10 city, soothed my mind into a most perfect tranquillity;
and sleep insensibly stole upon me, as I was indulging the
agreeable reveries which the objects around me naturally
inspired.
I immediately found myself in a vast extended plain, in
15 the middle of which arose a mountain higher than I had
h ere any conception of. It was covered with a multi-:(e of people, chiefly youth; many of whom pressed forward with the liveliest expressioh of ardor in their countenance, though the way was in many places steep and
20 difficult.
I observed that those who had but just begun to climb
the hill thought themselves not far from the top; but as
they proceeded, new hills were continually rising to their
view; and the summit o, the highest they could before
25 discern seemred but the foot of another, till the mountain
at length appeared to lose itself in the clouds.
As I was gazing on these things with astonishment, a
friendly instructor suddenly appeared: "The mnountain
before thee," said he, " is the Hill of Science. On the top
30 is the temple of- Truth, whose head is above the clouds,
and a veil of pure light covers her face. Observe the progress of her votaries; be silent and attentive."
After I had noticed a variety of objects, I turned my
eye towards the multitudes who were climbing the steep
35 ascent; and observed amongst them a youth of a lively
look, a piercing eye, and something fiery and irregular in
all his motions. His name was Genius. He darted like
an eagle up the mountain, and left his cormpan ons gazing
after him With envy and admiration; but his progress was
0 unequal, and interrupted by a thousand caprices.
When Pleasure warbled in the valley, he mingled in het
EX. XLV]

train. When Pride beckoned towards the precipice, he
ventured to the tottering edge. He delighted in devious
and untried paths, and made so many excursions from the
road, that his feebler companions often outstripped him.
5 I observed that the Muses beheld him with partiality; but
Truth often frowned, and turned aside her face.
While Genius was thus wasting his strength in eccentric
flights, I saw a person of very different appearance, named
Application. He crept along with a slow and unremitting
10 pace, his eyes fixed on the top of the mountain, patiently
removing every stone that obstructed his way, till he saw
most of those below him wrho had at first derided his slow
and toilsome progress.
Indeed, there were few who ascended the hill with equal
15 and uninterrupted steadiness; for, besides the difficulties
of the way, they were continually solicited to turn aside,
by a numerous crowd of appetites, passions and pleasures,
whose importunity, when once complied with, they became
less and less able to resist: and though they often returned
20 to the path, the asperities of the road were more severely
felt; the hill appeared more steep and rugged; the fruits,
which were wholesome and refreshing, seemed harsh and
ill-tasted; their sight grew dim, and their feet tripped at
every little obstruction.
25   I saw with some surprise that the Muses, whose business was to cheer and encourage those who were toiling
up the ascent, would often sing in the bowers of Pleasure,
and accompany those who were enticed away at the call
-:of the Passions. They accompanied them, however, but
30 a little way; and always forsook them when they lost
sight of the hill. The tyrants then doubled their chains
upon the unhappy captives, and led them away, without
resistance, to the cells of Ignorance, or the mansions of
Misery.
35   Amongst the innumerable seducers who were endeavoring to draw away the votaries of Truth from the path
of Science, there was one, so little formidable in her appearance, and so gentle and languid in her attempts, that
I should scarcely have taken notice of her, but for the
40 numbers she had imperceptibly loaded with her chains.
Indolence, (for so she was called,) far from proceeding to
open hostilities, did not attempt to turn their feet out of
the path, but contented herself with retarding their progress; and the purpose sthe could not force them to abana45 don, she persuaded them to delay.
272
LEX. XLVII.Her touch had a power like that of the torpedo, which
withered the strength of those who carne within its influence. Her unhappy captives still turned their faces towards the temple, and always hoped to arrive there; but the
5  ground seemed to slide from beneath their feet, and they
found themselves at the bottom before they suspected
they had changed their place.
The placid serenity which at first appeared in their
countenance changed by degrees into a melancholy lan10 guor, which was tinged with deeper and deeper gloom as
they glided down the stream of Insignificance; a dark and
sluggish water, which is curled by no breeze, and enlightened by no murmur, till it falls into a dead sea, where
startled passengers are awakened by the shock, and the
15 next moment buried in the gulf of Oblivion.
Of all the unhappy deserters from the paths of Science,
none seemed less able to return than the followers of Indolence. The captives of Appetite and Passion would often
seize the moment when their tyrants were languid or
20 as;lep, to escape from their enchantment; but the dominion of Indolence was constant and unremitted, and seldom
resisted, till resistance was in vain.
After contemplating these things, I turned my eyes towards the top of the mountain, where the air was always
25 pure and exhilarating, the path shaded with laurels and
evergreens, and the effulgence which beamed from the
face of Science seemed to shed a glory round her votaries.
Happy, said I, are they who are permitted to ascend the
mountain! But while I was pronouncing this exclama30 tion with uncommon ardor, I saw, standing beside me, a
form of diviner features, and a more benign radiance.
" Happier," said she, " are they whom Virtue conducts to
the mansions of Content! "
" What! " said I, " does Virtue then reside in the vale?"
35 " I am found," said she, "in the vale, and I illuminate the
mountain. I cheer the cottager at his toil, and inspire the
sage athis meditation. I mingle in the crowd of cities,
and bless the hermit in his cell. I have a temple in every
heart that owns my influence, and to him that wishes for
40 me I am already present. Science may raise thee to emi;
nence; but I alone can guide thee to felicity!" "
While Virtue was thus speaking, I stretched out my
arm~ towards her, with a vehemence which brole my slumber. The chill dews were falling around me, and the

The Passions. -An Ode.
WHEN Music, heavenly maid, was young,
5       While yet in early Greece she sung,
The Passions oft, to hear her shell,
Thronged around her magic cell,
Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting,
Possessed beyond the Muse's painting.
10       By turns they felt the glowing mind
Disturbed, delighted, raised, refined;
Till once,'t is said, when all were fired,
Filled with fury, rapt, inspired,
From the supporting myrtles round
15       They snatched her instruments of sound,
And, as they oft had heard apart
Sweet lessons of her forceful art,
Each (for madness ruled the hour)
Would prove his own expressive power.
20         First Fear, his hand, its skill to try,
Amid the chords bewildered laid;
And back recoiled, he knew not why,
Even at the sound himself had made.
Next Anger rushed:, his eyes on fire,
25       In lightnings owned his secret stings:
In one rude clash he struck the lyre,
And swept, with hurried hands, the strings.
With woful measures, wan DespairLow, sullen sounds his grief beguiled:
30       A solemn, strange and mingled air;'T was sad by fits - by starts't was wild.
But thou, 0 Hope! with eyes so fair,
What was thy delighted measure?
Still it whispered promised pleasure,

Still would her touch the strain prolong,
And from the rocks, the woods, the vale,
She called on Echo still through all her song:

A soft, responsive voice was heard at every close:
And Hope, enchanted, smiled, and waved her golden hair.

And, with a withering look,
The war-denouncing trumpet took,

The doubling drum, with furious heat;
And though, sometimes, each dreary pause between,
Dejected Pity, at his side,
15 Her soul-subduing voice applied,
Yet still he kept his wild, unaltered mien;
While each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from
his head.
Thy numbers, Jealousy, to nought were fixed;
20 Sad proofs of thy distressful state.
Of different themes the veering song was mixed:
And now, it courted Love; now, raving, called on HIate.
With eyes upraised, as one inspired,
Pale Melancholy sat retired;
25 And from her wild sequestered seat,
In notes by distance made more sweet,
Poured through the mellow horn her pensive soul.
And dashing soft, from rocks around,
Bubbling runnels joined the sound;

EXERCISE XLIX.
Adaptation of C?hristianity to the Intellectual Wants of M3an.
CHRISTIANITY is adapted to the intellect, because it puts
it in possession of a higher kind of knowledge than nature
can give. It solves questions of a different order, and
those, too, which man, as an intellectual being, most needs
20 to have solved.
There are plainly two classes of questions which we
may ask concerning the works of God; and concerning
one of these philosophy is profoundly silent. One class
respects the relation of the different parts of a constituted
25 whole to each other and to that whole. The other respects
the ultimate design of the whole itself.
In the present state of science, questions of the first class
can generally be answered with a good degree of satisfaction. alan existing, the philosopher can tell the number
30 of bones, and muscles, and blood-vessels, and nerves, in
his body, and the uses of all these. He may, perhaps, tell
how the stomach digests, and the heart beats, and the
glands secrete; but of the great purpose for which man
hiinself was made he can know nothing.
35   But this knowledge Christianity gives. It attributes to
God a purpose worthy of him; one that satisfies the
intellect and the heart; and the knowledge of this must
modify our views of all history, and of the whole drama.           ~      ~     ~~~~~~~~~...

[EX. XLrof human life. It gives us a new stand-point, from which
we see everything in different relations andt proportions.
We had seen the river before on which we were sailing;
now we see the ocean.
5   Entirely different must be the relation of man to God
both as an intellectual and a practical being, when he
knows his plans and can intelligently cooperate with himn.
He now comes, in the language of our Saviour, into the
relation of a friend. Surely no one can think lightly of
10 the influence of this on the intellect.
From the arguments now stated we infer that Christianity is adapted to the intellect; and these arguments are
confirmed by fact. No book, not nature itself, has ever
waked up intellectual activity like the Bible. On the bat15 tle-field of truth, it has ever been around this that the conflict has raged. What book besides ever caused the writing
of so many other books? Take from the libraries of Christendom all those which have sprung, I will not say indirectly, but directly, from it,--those written to oppose, or
20 defend, or elucidate it, -and how -would they be diminished!
The very multitude of infidel books is a witness to the
power with which the Bible stimulates the intellect. Why
do we not see the same amount of active intellect coming up
25 and dashing and roaring around the Koran? And the result
of this activity is such as we might anticipate. The geri
eral intellectual, as well as moral, superiority of Christian
nations, and that, too, in proportion as they have had a
pure Christianity, stands out in too broad a sunlight to be
30 questioned or obscured.
Wherever the word of God has really entered, it has
given light--light to individuals, light to communities.
It has favored literature; and by means of it alone has
society been brought up to that point at which it has been
35 able to construct the apparatus of physical science, and to
carry its investigations to the point which they have now
r eached.
The instruments of a well-furnished astronomical observatory presuppose accumulations of wealth, and the exist40 ence of a class of arts, and of men, that could be the product only of Christian civilization. Accordingly, we find,
whatever may be said of literature, that physical science,
except in Christian countries, has after a time either becomne stationary, or begun to recede; and there is no rea24

son for supposing that the path of indefinite progress
which now lies before it could have been opened except in
connection with Christianity.
Individual men, who reject Christianity, and yet live
5 within the general sphere of its influence, may distinguish
themselves in science; they have done so; but it has been
on grounds and conditions furnished by that very religion
which they have rejected.
Christianity furnishes no new faculties, no direct power
10 to the intellect, but a general condition of society favorable
to its cultivation; and it is not to be wondered at, if, in
such a state of things, men who seek intellectual distinction solely, rejecting the moral restraints of Christianity,
should distinguish themselves by intellectual effort.
15   But if there is this adaptation of Christianity to the intellect, ought not they who are truly Christians to distinguish themselves above others in literature and science.?
This does not follow. Up to a certain point, Christianity
in the heart will certainly give clearness and strength to
20 the intellect; and cases are not wanting in which the intellectual powers have been surprisingly roused through
the action of the moral nature, and of the affections,
awakened by the religion of Christ.
But when we consider that the change produced by
25 Christianity is a moral change; that the objects it presents
are moral objects; that it presents this world as needing
not so much to be enlightened in the more abstract sciences, or to be delighteid with the refinements of literature,
as to be rescued from moral pollution, and to be won back
30 to God; -perhaps we ought not to be surprised if it has
caused many to be absorbed in labors of an entirely different kind, who would otherwise have trodden the highest walks of science. - President Hopkins.

And oft at dawn, deep noon, or falling eve,

clay, and opened his eyes. Then again the Pharisees
also asked him how he had received his sight. He said
unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed,
and do see. Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This
20 man is not of God, because he keepeth not the Sabbathday. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do
such miracles?
And there was a division among them. They say unto
the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he
25 hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he
had been blind, and received his sight, until they called
the parents of him that had received his sight. And they
asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom ye say was
30 born blind? How then doth he now see? His parents
answered them and said, We know that this is our son,
and that he was born blind: but by what means he now
seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we
know not: he is of age, ask him: he shall speak for
35 himnself.
These words spake his parents, because they feared the
Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man
did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the
synagogue. Therefore said his parents, He is of age;
40 ask him.
Then again called they the man that was blind, and
said unto him, Give God the praise; we know that this
man is a sinner. lIe answered and said, Whether he be
a sinner or no, I know not: one thing r know, that, where
45 as I was blind, now I see

[EX. LLThen said they to him again, What did he to thee?
How opened he thine eyes? He answered them, I have
told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would
ye hear it again? wi.l ye also be his disciples?  Then
5 they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we
are Moses' disciples. We know that God spake unto
Moses; as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.
The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is
a mar;.lIous thing, that ye know not from whence he is,
10 and yet he hath opened mine eyes. Now we know that
God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshiper
of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. Since the
world began was it not heard that any man opened the
eyes of one that was born blind. If this man were not
15 of God, he could do nothing.
They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast
him out. Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and
when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou be20 lieve on the Son of God? He answered and said, Who
is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? And Jesus said
unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that
talketh with thee. And he said, Lord, I believe. And
he worshiped him.
25   And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this
world; that they which see not might see, and that they
which see might be made blind. And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said
unto him, Are we blind also?  Jesus said unto them, If
30 ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say,
We see; therefore your sin remaineth.

What sage to hear, he heard; what scenes to see,
He saw. And first, in rambling school-boy days,
Britannia's mountain-walks, and heath-girt lakes,
30  And story-telling glens, and founts, and brooks;
And maids, as dew-drops pure and fair, his soul
With grandeur filled, and melody and love.
Then travel came, and took him where he wished;
He cities saw, and courts, and princely pomp;

And mused on battle-fields, where valor fought
In other days; and mused on ruins gray
With years; and drank from old and fabulous wells,
And plucked the vine that first-born prophets plucked,
40  And mused on falnous tombs; and on the wave
Of ocean mused; and on the desert waste.

Marching upon the storm in vengeance seemed -

The Grotto of Antiparos.
OF all the subterraneous caverns now known, the grotto)
25 of Antiparos is the most remarkable, as well for its extent
as for the beauty of its sparry incrustations. This celebrated cavern was first explored by one Magni, an Italian
traveler, about one hundred years ago, at Antiparos, an
inconsiderable island of the Archipelago.
30   " Having been informed," says he, " by the natiyves of
Paros, that, in the little island of Antiparos, which lies
about two miles from the former, a gigantic statue was to
be seen at the mouth of a cavern in that place, it was resolved that we (the French consul and himself) should
35 pay it a visit.
"In pursuance of this resolution, after we had landed, 287
ZX. -LIn.J
RHETORICAL READ.i J.on the island, and walked about four miles through the
midst of beautiful plains, and sloping woodlands, we at
length came to a little hill, on the side of which yawned a
most horrid cavern, which, by its gloom, at first struck us
5 with terror, and almost repressed curiosity. Recovering
the first surprise, however, we entered boldly, and had not,proceeded above twenty paces, when the supposed statue
of the giant presented itself to our view.
" We quickly perceived that what the ignorant natives
1  had been terrified at as a giant was nothing more than a
sparry concretion, formed by the water dropping from the
roof of the cave, and by degrees hardening into a figure,
which their fears had formed into a monster. Incited by
this extraordinary appearance, we were induced to proceed
15 still further, in quest of new adventures, in this subterranean abode.
"As we proceeded, new wonders offered themselves; the
spars, formed into trees and shrubs, presented a kind of
petrified grove; some white, some green; and all reced20 ing in due perspective. They struck us with the more
amazement, as we knew them to be mere productions of
nature, who, hitherto in solitude, had, in her playful moments, dressed the scene as if for her own amusement.
" We had as yet seen but a few of the wonders of the
25 place; and we were introduced only into the portico of
this amazing temple. In one corner of this half-illuminated recess, there appeared an opening of about th'ree feet
wide, which seemed to lead to a place totally dark, and
which one of-the natives assured us contained nothing
30 more than a reservoir of water.
"Upon this information, we made an experiment, by
throwing down some stones, which rumbling along the
sides of the descent for some time, the sound seemed at
last quashed in a bed of water. In order, however, to be
35 more certain, we sent in a Levantine mariner, who, by
the promise of a good reward, ventured, with a flarnmbeau
in his hand, into this narrow aperture.
" After continuing within it for about a quarter of an
hour, he returned, bearing in his hand some beautiful pieces
40 of white spar, which art could neither equal nor imitate.
Upon being informed by him that the place was full of
these beautiful incrustations, I ventured in with him, about
fifty paces, anxiously and cautiously descending, by a steep
and dangerous way.

"'4Finding, however, that we came to a precipice which
led into a spacious amphitheater, (if I may so call it,) still
deeper than any other part, we returned, and being provided with a ladder, flambeau, and other things to expedite
5  our descent, our whole company, man by man, ventured
into the same opening; and, descending one after another,
we at last saw ourselves all together in the most magnificent part of the cavern.
"Our candles being now all lighted up, and the whole
10 place completely illuminated, never could the eye be presented with a more glittering or a more magnificent scene.
The whole roof hung with solid icicles, transparent as
glass, yet solid as marble.
" The eye cbuld scarcely reach the lofty and noble ceil15 ing; the sides were regularly formed with spars; and the
whole presented the idea of a magnificent theater, illuminated with an immense profusion of lights. The floor
consisted of solid marble; and, in several places, magnificent columns, thrones, altars, and other objects, appeared,
20 as if nature had designed to mock the curiosities of art.
"Our voices, upon speaking or singing, were redoubled
to an astonishing loudness; and upon the firing of a gun,
the noise and reverberations were almost deafening. In
the midst of this grand amphitheatre rose a concretion of
25 about fifteen feet high, that, in some measure, resembled
an altar; from which, taking the hint, we caused mass to
be celebrated there. The beautiful columns that shot up
round the altar appeared like candlesticks; and many
other natural objects represented the customary ornaments
30 of this rite.
" Below even this spacious grotto, there seemed another
cavern; down which I ventured, with my former mariner,
and descended about fifty paces, by means of -a rope. I at
last arrived at a small spot of level ground, where the bot35 tom appeared different from that of the amphitheater, being composed of soft clay, yielding to the pressure, and in
which I thrust a stick to the depth of six feet.
" In this, however, as above, numbers of the most beautiful crystals were formed; one of which, particularly,
40 resembled a table. Upon our egress from this amazing
cavern, we perceived a Greek inscription upon a rock at
the mouth, but so obliterated by time that we could not
read it distinctly. It seemed to import that one Antipater,
in the time of Alexander, had come hither; but whether

the sourid of my voice will sustain me in saying, that
there has been no moment since Washing,ton himself was
among us, when it was more important than at this imoment, that the two great leading principles of his policy
5 should be remembered and cherished.
Those principles were, first, the most complete, cordial.,
and indissoluble union of the states; and, second, the most
entire separation and disentanglement of our own country
from all other countries. Perfect union among ourselves,
10 perfect neutrality towards others, and peace, peace, domestic peace and foreign peace, as the result; this was the
chosen and consummate policy of the father of his country.
But above all, and before all, in the heart of Washington, was the union of the states; and no opportunity
15 was ever omitted by him to. impress upon his fellowcitizens the profound sense which he entertained of its
vital importance at once to their prosperity and their
liberty.
In that incomparable address in which he bade farewell
20 to his countrymen at the close of his presidential service,
he touched upon many other topics with the earnestness
of a sincere conviction. Ile called upon them, in solemn
terms, to " cherish public credit;" to " observe good faith
and justice towards all nations," avoiding both " inveterate
25 antipathies and passionate attachments" towards any; to
mitiogate and assuage the unquenchable fire of party spirit,
lest, instead of warming, it should consume;" to abstain
from  "characterizing parties by geographical distinctions;" " to promote institutions for the general diffusion
30 of knowledge;" to respect and uphold " religion and morality; those great pillars of human happiness, those
firmest props of the duties of men and of citizens."
But what can exceed, what can equal, the accumulated
intensity of thought and of expression with which he calls
35 upon them to cling to the union of the states. "It is of
infinite moment," says he, in language which we ought
never to be weary of hearing or of repeating, " that you
shoulld properly estimate the immense value of your National Union to your collective and individual happiness;
40 that you should cherish a cordial, habitual, immovable
attachment to it; accustoming yourselves to think and
speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and
prosperity; watching for its preservation with jealous
anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even asuspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and
indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every
attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the
rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together
5 the various parts."
The Union, the Union in any event, was thua the sentiment of Washington. The Union, the Union in any
event, - let it be our sentiment this day!
Yes, to-day, fellow-citizens, at the very moment when
10' the extension of our boundaries and the multiplication of
our territories are producing, directly and indirectly, amlong
the different members of our political system, so many
marked and mourned centrifugal tendencies, let us seize
this occasion to renew to each other our vows of alle15 giance and devotion to the American Union, and let us
recognize in our common title to the name and the fame
of Washington, and in our common veneration for his
example and his advice, the all-sufficient centripetal power,
which shall hold the thick clustering stars of our confed20 eracy in one glorious constellation forever!  Let the
column which we are about to construct be at once a
pledge and an emblem of perpetual union! Let the foundations be laid, let the superstructure be built up and
cemented, let each stone be raised and riveted, in a spirit
25 of national brotherhood! And may the earliest ray of
the rising sun - till that sun shall set to rise no moredraw forth from it daily, as from the fabled statue of
antiquity, a strain of national harmony, which shall
strike a responsive chord in every heart throughout the
30 republic!
Proceed, then, fellow-citizens, with the work for which
you have assembled! Lay the corner-stone of a monument which shall adequately bespeak the gratitude of the
whole American people to the illustrious father of his
35 country! Build it to the skies; you cannot outreach the
loftiness of his principles! Found it upon the massive
and eternal rock; you cannot make it more enduring than
his fame! Construct it of the peerless Parian marble;
you cannot make it purer than his life! Exhaust upon it
40 the rules and principles of ancient and of modern art;
you cannot make it more proportionate than his character!

Till through the lucid chambers of the south

Now when the cheerless empire of the sky
To Capricorn the Centaur Archer yields,

Faint are his gleams, and ineffectual shoot

Lies a brown deluge; as the low-bent cloudia
Pour flood on flood, yet unexhausted still
Combine, and, deepening into night, shut up

The wanderers of heaven
Each to his home retire; save those that love
To take their pastime in the troubled air,
Or skimming flutter round the dimply pool.

And ask, with meaning low, their wonted stalls,

Then o'er the sanded valley floating spreads,
Calm, sluggish, silent; till again, constrained
Between two meeting hills, it bursts away,

Wears a wan circle round her blunted horns.
Seen through the turbid, fluctuating air,
The stars obtuse emit a shivered ray;

Snatched in short eddies, plays the withered leaf;

Then issues forth the storm with sudden burst,
And hurls the whole precipitated air
Down in a torrent. On the passive main
40 Descends the ethereal force, and with strong gust
Turns from its bottom the discolored deep.
Through the black night that sits immense around,
Lashed into foam, the fierce conflicting brine
Seems o'er a thousand raging waves to burn.

Now Naaman, captain of the host of the King of Syria,

by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria: he
20 was also a mighty man in valor, but he was a leper.
And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had
brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little
maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife. And she said
unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the
25 prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of
his leprosy. And one went in, and told his lord, saying,
Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.
And the King of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send
a letter unto the King of Israel. And he departed, and
30 took with him ten talents of silver, and slxvthousand pieces
of gold, and ten changes of raiment. And he brought the
letter to the King of Israel, saying, Now when this letter
is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman

5   And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard
that the King of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to
the king, saying, Where-fore hast thou rent thy clothes?
let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a
prophet in Israel.
10   So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot,
and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. And Elisha
sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan
seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and
thou shalt be clean.
15   But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand,
and call on the name of the Lord his God, and strike his
hand over the place, and recover the leper. Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the
20 waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean?
So he turned and went away in a rage.
And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and
said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great
thing, wouldst thou not have done it? how much rather
25 then, when he saith to thee, Wash and be clean. Then
went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan,
according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh
came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was
clean.
30'And he returned to the man of God, he and all his
company, and came and stood before him: and he said,
Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth,
but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee take a blessing
of thy servant. But he said, As the Lord liveth, before
35 whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to
take it; but he refused.
And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be
given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy
servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sac40 rifice unto other gods, but unto the Lord. In this thinr

But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said,
Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in
5 not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but as
the Lord liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat
of him. So Gehazi followed after Naaman.
And when Naaman saw him running after him, he
lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all
10 well?  And he said, All is well. My master hathl sent
me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from
Mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two
changes of garments.
15   And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And
he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags,
with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of
his servants; and they bare them before him. And when
he came to the tower, he took them from.:eir hand and
20 bestowed them in the house: and he let thit men go, and
they departed.  But he went in, and stood before his
master.
And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither. And
25 he said unto him, Went not my heart with thee, when
the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is
it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and
olive-yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maid-servants? The leprosy, therefore, of
30 Naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed forever.
And he went out from his presence a leper as white as
snow.

Elxtract from a Speec/h of Lord Fianlfzeld, zn the British
Parliament, in the year 1770.
MY LORDS,--I come now to speak upon what, indeed
I would have gladly avoided, had I not been particuiarly
pointed at for the part I have taken in this bill. It has
been said by a noble lord on my left hand, that I liLewise
am -runnino the race of popularity.
5    If the noble lord means by popularity that applause
bestowed by after ages on good and virtuous actions, 1
have long been struggling in that race; to what purpose
all-trying time can alone determine: but if the noble
lord means that mushroom popularity that is raised with10 out merit and lost without crime, he is much mistaken in
his opinion. I defy the noble lord to point out a single
action of my life, where the popularity of the times ever
had the smallest influence on my determinations.
I thank God I have a more permanent and steady rule
15 for my conduct, - the dictates of my own breast. Those
that have foregone that pleasing adviser, and given up
their mind to be the slave of every popular impulse, I sincerely pity; I pity them still more, if their vanity leads
them to mistake the shouts of a mob for the trumpet of
20 fame. Experience might inform them, that many who
have been saluted with the huzzas of a drowd one day
have received their execrations the next; and many, who,
by the popularity of their times, have been held up as
spotless patriots, have, nevertheless, appeared upon the
25 historian's page, when truth has triumphed over delusion,
the assassins of liberty.
Why, then, the noble lord can think I am ambitious of
present popularity, that echo of folly and shadow of renown, I amn at a loss to determine.
30   Besides, I do not know that the bill now before your
lordships will be popular: it depends much upon the
caprice of the day. It may not be popular to compel people to pay their debts; and in that case, the present must
be a very unpopular bill. It may not be popular neither
35 to take away any of the privileges of Parliament; for I
very well remember, and many of your lordships may
remnember, that not long ago the popular cry was for the
extension of privilege; and so far did they carry it at
that time, that it was said that the privilege protected
308
[Ex LXmItRHETORICAL READING.
members even in criminal actions; nay, such was the
power of popular prejudices over weak mindis, that the
very decisions of some of the courts were tinctured with
that doctrine.
5    It was undoubtedly an abominable doctrine; I thought
so then, and think so still: but, nevertheless, it was a popular doctrine, and came immediately from those who are
called the friends of liberty; how deservedly, time will
show. True liberty, in my opinion, can only exist when
10 justice is equally administered to all; to the king, and to
the beggar.
Where is the justice, then, or where is the law, that
protects a member of Parliament, more than any other
man, from the punishment due to his crimes? The laws
15 of this country allow of no place, nor any employment, to
be a sanctuary for crimes; and where I have the honor to
sit as judge, neither royal favor nor popular applause shall
ever protect the guilty.
I have now only to beg pardon for having employed so
20 much of your lordships' time; and I am sorry a bill,
fraught with so many good consequences, has not met
with an abler advocate; but I doubt not your lordships'
determination will convince the world, that a bill, calculated to contribute so much to the equal distribution of jus25 tice as the present, requires with your lordships but very
little support.

LESSON VIII.
THE PERIOD, INTERROGATION, AND EXCLAMATION UNITED.
The pupil was taught, in the first lesson, (see-No. 3,) that when he
comes to a period, he must stop, as if he had nothing more to read. At
the end of a paragraph, whether the period or any other mark be used,
a longer pause should be made than at the end of an ordinary sentence.
The interrogation and the exclamation points generally require pau.es
of the same length with the period.
It rmay here' be remarked, that good readers always MAKE THEIR
PAUSES LONG; but whatever be the length of the pause, the pupil must be
careful that every pause which he makes shall be a TOTAL CESSATION OF
THE VOICE.

Cause of Differences in Opizion.
IT is characteristic of the human mind, not to be willing
to wait long in suspense on any question presented to it
for decision. When any new question'or new subject
10 comes before us, we grasp hastily at the little information
in regard to it within our immediate reach, and then hurry
to a decision. We are not often willing to wait to consider whether the subject is fairly within the grasp of our
powers, and whether all the facts which are important to
15 a proper consideration of it are before us. We decide at
once. It is not pleasant to be in suspense. Suspense
implies ignorance, and to admit ignorance is humiliating.
Hence most persons have a settled belief upon almost
every question which has been brought before them. In
20 expressing their opinions they mention things which they
believe, and things which they do not believe; but very
few people have a third class of questions, which they acknowledge to be beyond their grasp, so that in regard to
them thev call neither believe nor disbelieve, but must
25 remain in suspense.
Now this is the secret of nine tenths of the difference
of opinion, and of the sharp disputes by which this world
is made so noisy a scene. Men jump at conclusions before they distinctly understand the premises; and as each.30 one sees only a part of what he ought to see before forming his-opinion, it is not surprising that each should see a
different part, and should consequently be led to different
results. They then fall into a dispute, each ptesenting his
own partial view, and shutting his eves to that exhibited
35 by his opponent.
Some of the mistakes which men thus fall into are meiancholy; others only ludicrous. Some European traveller.

with proud and haughty look, and said to the bystanders,
" This map is entirely wrong; the English know nothing
of geography. They have got China out upon one side
5 of the world, whereas it is, in fact, exactly in the middle."
Multitudes of amusing stories are related by travellers
of the mistakes and misconceptions and false reasonings
of semi-barbarous people, about the subjects of European
science and philosophy. They go to reasoning at once,
10 and fall into the grossest errors; but still they have much
more confidence in their silly speculations than in any
evidence which their minds are capable of receiving.

On the 127mportance of Order in the Distribuztion of Time.
TrME we ought to consider as a sacred trust, committed
to us by God; of which we are now the depositories, and
are to render an account at the last. That portion of it
which he has allotted to us is intended partly for the con5 cerns of this world, partly for those of the next. Let each
of these occupy, in the distribution of our time, that space
which properly belongs to it.
Let not the hours of hospitality and pleasure interfere
with the discharge of our necessary affairs; and let not
10 what we call necessary affairs encroach upon the time
which is due to devotion. To everything there is a season,
and a time for every purpose under heaven. If we delay
till to-morrow what ought to be done to-day, we overcharge
the morrow with a burden which belongs not to it. We
15 load the wheels of time, and prevent them from carrying
us along smoothly.
He who every morning plans the transactions of the day,
and follows out that plan, carries on a thread which will
guide him through the labyrinth of the most busy life.
20 The orderly arrangement of his time is like a ray of light,
which darts itself through all his affairs. But wvhere no
plan is laid, where the disposal of time is surrendered
merely to the chance of incidents, all things lie huddled
together in one chaos, which admits neither of distribution
25 nor review.
The first requisite for introducing order into the management of time is to be impressed with a just sense of
its value. Let us consider well how much depends upon
it, and how fast it flies away. The bulk of men are in
30 nothing more capricious and inconsistent than in their
appreciation of time.  When they think of it as the
measure of their continuance on earth, they highly prize
it, and with the greatest anxiety seel to lengthen it out.
But when they view it in separate parcels, they appear
35 to hold it in contempt, and squander it with inconsiderate
profusion. While they complain that life is short. they
are often wishing its different periods at an end. Covetous
of every otler possession, of time only they are prodigal.
They allow every idle man to be master of this property,
40 and make every frivolous occuDation welcome that can
help^them to consume it.

Among those who are so careless of time, it is not to be
expected that order should be observed in its distributiorn.
But, by this fatal neglect, how many materials of severe
and lasting regret are they laying up in store for them5 selves! The time which they suffer to pass away in the
midst of confusion, bitter repentance seeks afterwards in
vain to recall. What was omitted to be done at its proper
mnoment, arises to be the torment of some future season.
Manhood is disgraced by the consequences of neglected
10 youth. Old age, oppressed by cares that belonged to a
former period, labors under a burden not its own. At the
close of life, the dying man beholds with anguish that his
days are finishing, when his preparation for eternity is
hardly commenced. Such are the effects of a disorderly
15 waste of time, through not attending to its value. Everything in the life of such persons is misplaced. Nothing is
performed aright, from not being performed in due season.
But he who is orderly in the distribution of his time
tales the proper method of escaping those manifold evils.
20 He is justly said to redeem the time. By proper management he prolongs it. He lives much in little space; more
in a few years than others do in many. He can live to
God and his own soul, and at the same time, attend to all
the lawful interests of the present world. He looks back
25 on the past, and provides for the future.
He catches and arrests the hours as they fly. They are
marlted down for useful purposes, and their memory remains. Whereas those hours fleet by the man of confusion like a shadow. His days and years are either blanks,
30 of which he has no remembrance, or they are filled up
with so confused and irregular a succession of unfinished
transactions, that though he remembers he has been blusy,
yet he can give no,account of the business wllich has
employed him.- Blair.

Concluszon of an Address to President Washington, in
allusion to his retiringfrom office.
SIR, while we entertain a grateful conviction that your
wise, firm, and patriotic administration has been signally
conducive to the success of the present form of government,
we cannot forbear to express the deep sensations of regret
5 with which we contemplate your intended retirement from
office.
As no other suitable occasion may occur, we cannot suffer the present to pass without attempting to disclose some
of the emotions which it cannot fail.to awaken.
10   The gratitude and admiration of your countrymen are
still drawn to the recollection of those resplendent virtues
and talents which were so eminently instrumental to the
achievement of the RevolUtion, and of which that glorious
event will ever be the memorial. Your obedience to the
15 voice of duty and your country, when you quitted reluctantly, a second time, the retreat you had chosen, and first
accepted the presidency, afforded a new proof of the devotedness of vour zeal in its service, and an earnest of the
patriotism and success which has characterized your admin20 istration. As the grateful confidence of the citizens in the
virtues of their chief magistrate has essentially contributed
to that success, we persuade ourselves that the millions
whom we represent participate with us in the anxious
solicitude of the present occasion.
25   Yet we cannot be unmindful that your moderation and
magnanimity, twice displayed by retiring from your exalted
stations, afford examples no less rare and instructive to
mankind than valuable to a republic.
Although we are sensible that this event, of itself,
30 completes the luster of a character already conspicuously
unrivaled by the coincidence of virtue, talents, success,
and public estimation, yet we conceive we owe it to you, sir,
and still more emphatically to ourselves, and to our nation,
(of the language of whose hearts we presume to think
35 ourselves at this moment the faithful interpreters,) to express the sentiments with which it is contemplated.
The spectacle of a free and enlightened nation offering
by its representatives the tribute of unfeigned approbation
to its first citizen, however novel and interesting it may be,
40 lerives all its luster (a luster which accident or enthiusiasm
B16
[EX. LXIX.could not bestow, and which adulation would tarnish,)
from the transcendent merit of which it is the voluntary
testimony.
May you long enjoy that liberty which is so dear to
5  you, and to which your name will ever be so dear. May
your own virtues and a. nation's prayers obtain the happiest
sunshine for the decline of your days, and the choicest of
future blessings. For our country's sake, for the sake of
republican liberty, it is our earnest wish that your example
10 may be the guide of your successors, and thus, after being
the ornament and safeguard of the present age, become
the patrimony of our descendants. - Fisher Awes.

That he hung on its margin far and near,
Where a rock could rear its head.
He went to the windows of those who slept,
30  And over each pane like a fairy he crept;
Wherever he breathed, wherever he stepped,
By the light of the moon were seen
Most beautiful things; there were flowers and trees;
There were bevies of birds, and swarms of bees;
35  There were cities, with temples and towers; and these
All pictured in silver sheen.

Character of Lord Chatham.
THE secretary stood alone. Modern degeneracy had
not reached him. Original and unaccommodating, the
features of his character had the hardihood of antiquity.
His august mind overawed majesty, and one of his sover-,0 eigns thought royalty so impaired in his presence, that he
conspired to remove him, in order to be relieved from his
superiority.
No state chicanery, no narrow system of vicious politics,
no idle contest for ministerial victories, sunk him to the
15 vulgar level of the great: but overbearing, persuasive,
and impracticable, his object was England, his ambition
was fame. Without dividing, he destroyed party; without corrupting, he made a venal age unanimous. France
sunk beneath him. With one hand he smote the house
20 of Bourbon, and wielded in the other the democracy of
England.
The sight of his mind was infinite; and his schemes
were to affect, not England, not the present age only, but
Europe and posterity. Wonderful were the means by
25 which these schemes were accomplished; always seasonable, always adequate, the suggestions of an understanding animated by ardor, and enlightened by prophecy.
The ordinary feelings which make life amiable and indolent were unknown to him. No domestic difficulties,
30 no domestic weakness, reached him; but aloof from the
sordid occurrences of life, and unsullied by its intercourse,
he came occasionally into our system, to counsel and to
decide.
A character so exalted, so strenuous, so various, so au35 thoritative, astonished a corrupt age, and the treasury
trembled at the name of Pitt throucrh all her classes of
venality. Corruption imagined, indeed, that she had found
defects in this statesman, and talked much of the incon818:

sistency of his glory, and much of the ru n of his victories; But the history of his country and the calamniti'es of
the enemy answered and refuted tier.
Nor were his political abilities his only talents: his elo5  quence was an era in the senate, peculiar and spontaneous, familiarly expressing gigantic sentiments and instinctive wisdom; not like the torrent of Demosthenes, or the
splendid conflagration of Tully; it resembled sometimes
the thunder, and sometimes the music of the spheres.
10   Like Murray, he did not conduct the understanding
through the painful pubtilty of argumentation; nor was
he, like Townshend, forever on the racl of exertion; but
rather lightened upon the subject, and reached the point
by the flashings of the mind, which, like those of his eye,
15 were felt, but could not be followed.
Upon the whole, there was in this man something that
could create, subvert, or reform; an understanding, a
spirit, and an eloquence, to summon mankind to society,
or to break the bonds of slavery asunder, and to rule the
20 wilderness of free minds with unbounded authority; something that could establish or overwhelm empire, and strike
a blow in the world that should resound through the universe.- Grattan.

Resurrection.
From I Corinthians, Chapter XV.
lMOREOVER, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which
I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and
wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye keep
20 in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have
believed in vain.
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also
received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the
scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again
25 the third day. according to the scriptures; and that he was
seen of Cephas, then of the twelve. After that he was
seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the
greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen
asleep.
30   After that he was seen of James; then of all the apostles; and last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born
out of due time. For I am the least of the apostles, that
I am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted
the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what
35 I am;and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not
in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet
not I, but the grace of God which was with me. There322
[EX. LILfore, whether it were I or they, so- we preach, and so ye
believed.
Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead,
how say some among you that there is no resurrection of
5 the dead? But if there be no resurrection of the dead,
then is Christ not risen. And if Christ be not risen, then
is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea,
and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised
10 not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead
rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not
raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then
they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all
15 men most miserable.
But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came
death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.
For as in Adam all die, even so is Christ shall all be made
20 alive.
But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits;
afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. Then
cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put
25 down all rule, and all authority, and power. For he must
reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The
last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he hath
put all things under his feet.
But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is
30 manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under
him. And when all things shall be subdued unto him,
then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that
put all things under him, that God may be all in all.
Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead,
35 if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for
the dead? and why stand we in jeopardy every hour? I
protest by your rejoicing, which I have, in Christ Jesus
our Lord, I die daily. If after the manner of men I have
fought with beasts, at Ephesus, what advantageth it me
40 if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to-morrow
we die.
Be not deceived; evi, communications corrupt good manners. Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have
not the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.

But some man will say, How are the dead raised up?
and with what body do they come? Thou fool, that which
thou sowest is not quickened, except it die. And that
which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall
5 be, but bare grain; it may chance of wheat, or of some
other grain: but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased
him, and to every seed his own body.
All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of
flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and
10 another of birds. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the
glory of the terrestrial is another.
There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the
moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth
15 from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of
the dead: it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorrup.
tion: it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory: it is sown
in weakness, it is raised in power: it is sown a natural
body, it is raised a spiritual body.
20   There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.
Howbeit, that was not first which is spiritual, but that
which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
25 The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is
the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they
also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they
also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image
of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
30   Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot
inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit
incorruption. Behold, I show you a mystery: We shall
not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in
the twinliling of an eye, at the last trump; for the trumpet
35 shall sound; and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and
we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on
incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption,
and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall
40 be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is
swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting?
O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin
and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God
which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

A mighty maze! but not without a plan;
Together let us beat this ample field,

Of all who blindly creep, or sightless soar;
Eye nature's walks, shoot folly as it flies,
And catch the manners living as they rise;

May tell why Heaven has made us as we are.

The strong connections, nice dependencies,

Looked through? or can a part contain the whole?

All but the page prescribed, their present state;

Or who could suffer being here below?
The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day,
20 Had he thy reason, would he skip and play?
Pleased to the last, he crops the flowery food,
And licks the hand just raised to shed his blood.
Oh blindness to the future! kindly given,

But since not every good we can divide,
And reason bids us for our own provide,
Passions, though selfish, if their means be fair,
List under reason, and deserve her care;
5 Those, that imparted court a nobler aim,
Exalt their kind, and take some virtue's name.
As fruits, ungrateful to a planter's care,
On savage stocks inserted learn to bear;
The surest virtues thus from passions shoot,

What crops of wit and honesty appear
From spleen, fiom obstinacy, hate, or fear!
See anger, zeal and fortitude supply;
E'en avarice, prudence; sloth, philosophy;
15 Envy, to which the ignoble mind's a slave,
Is emulation in the learned or brlave;
Nor virtue, male or female, can we name,
But what will grow on pride, or girow on shame.
Thus nature gives us (let it check our pride)
20 The virtue nearest to our vice allied:
Reason the bias turns to good from ill,
And Nero reigns a Titus, if he will.
The fiery soul abhorred in Catiline,
In Decius charms, in Curtius is divine:
25 The same ambition can destroy or save,
And makes a patriot as it makes a knave.
This light and darkness in our chaos join'd,
What shall divide? The God within the mind.
Extremes in nature equal ends produce,
30 In man they join to some mysterious use;
Though each by turns the other's bounds invade,
As in some well-wrought picture, light and shade,
And oft so mixt the difference is too nice
Where ends the virtue, or begins the vice.

That vice or virtue there is none at all.

15    And in this state she shallops, night by night,
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love:
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees:
O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream:
And sometimes comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,

Then dreams he of another benefice.
Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck;
And then he dreams of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades;

The true soil for these is our own continent, the new
world, the last of the three great geographical divisions
of which we have spoken. This is the spot on which the
beautiful theories of the European philosopher --who
5  had risen to the full freedom of speculation, while action
was controlled --have been reduced to practice. The
atmosphere here seems as fatal to the arbitrary institutions
of the old world as that has been to the democratic
forms of our own. It seems scarcely possible that any
10 other organization than these latter should exist here.
In three centuries from the discovery of the country, the
various races by which it is tenanted - some of them from
the least liberal of the European monarchies -have, with
few exceptions, come into the adoption of institutions of a
15 republican character. Toleration, civil and religious, has
been proclaimed, and enjoyed to an extent unknown since
the world began, throughout the wide borders of this vast
continent. Alas for those portions which have assumed
the exercise of these rights without fully comprehending
20 their import! who have been intoxicated with the fumes
of freedom, instead of drawing nourishment from its living
principle!
It was fortunate, or, to speak more properly, a providential thing, that the discovery of the new world was post25 poned to the precise period when it occurred. Had it
taken place at an earlier time--during the flourishing
period of the feudal ages, for example--the old institutions of Europe, with their hallowed abuses, might have
been ingrafted on this new stock, and, instead of the fruit
30 of the tree of life, we should have furnished only varieties of a kind already far exhausted and hastening to
decay.
But, happily, some important discoveries in science,
and, above all, the glorious Reformation, gave an electric
35 shock to the intellect, long benumbed under the influence
of a tyrannical priesthood. It taught men to distrust
authority, to trace effects back to their causes, to search for
themselves, and to take no guide but the reason which God
had given them. It taught them to claim the right of
40 free inquiry as their inalienable birthright, and, with free
inquiry, freedom of action. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were the period of the mighty struggle
between the conflicting elements of religion, as the eighteenth and nineteenth have been that of the great contest
45 for civil liberty.
336
[EX. LXXVH.It was in the midst of this universal ferment, and in
consequence of it, that these shores were first peopled by
our Puritan ancestors. Here they found a world where
they might verify the value of those theories which had
5 been derided as visionary, or denounced as dangerous, in
their own land. All around was free  free as nature
herself: the mighty st eams rolling on in their majesty,
as they had continued lo roll from the creation; the forests, which no hand had violated, flourishing in primeval
10 grandeur and beauty--their only tenants the wild animals,
or the Indians, nearly as wild, scarcely held together by
any tie of social polity.
Nowhere was the trace of civilized man or of his curious contrivances. Here was no Star Chamber nor Court
15 of High Commission; no racks, nor jails, nor gibbets; no
feudal tyrant, to grind the poor man to the dust on which
he toiled; no Inquisition, to pierce into the thought, and
to make thought a crime. The only eye that was upon
them was the eye of Heaven.
20   True, indeed, in the first heats of suffering enthusiasm,
they did not extend that charity to others which they
claimed for themselves. It was a blot on their characters,
but one which they share in common with most reformers.
The zeal requisite for great revolutions, whether in church
o25 or state, is rarely attended by charity for difference of
opinion. Those who are willing to do and to suffer bravely for their own doctrines attach a value to them which
makes them impatient of opposition from others.
The martyr for conscience' sake cannot comprehend the
30 necessity of leniency to those who denounce those truths
for which he is prepared to lay down his own life. If he
set so little value on his own life, is it natural he should
set more on that of others? The Dominican, who dragged
his victims to the fires of the Inquisition in Spain, freely
35 gave up his ease and his life to the duties of a missionary
among the heathen. The Jesuits, who suffered martyrdom
among the American savages in the propagation of their
faith, stimulated those very savages to their horrid massacres of the Protestant settlements of New England. God
40 has not often combined charity with enthusiasm. When
he has done so, he has produced his noblest workl-a
More, or a Fenelon.
But if the first'settlers were intolerant in practice, they
brought with them the living principle of freedom, which

would survive when their generation had passed away.
They could not avoid it; for their coming here was in
itself an assertion of that principle. They came for conscience' sake -to worship God in their own way. Free5 dom of political institutions they at once avowed. Every
citizen took his part in the political scheme, and enjoyed
all the consideration of an equal participation in'ivil privileges: and liberty in political matters gradually brought
with it a corresponding liberty in religious concerns.
10   In their subsequent contest with the mother country
they learned a reason for their faith, and the best manner
of defending it. Their liberties struck a deep root in the
soil, amid storms which shook but could not prostrate
them. It is this struggle with the mother country, this
15 constant assertion of the right of self-government, this tendency - feeble ill its beginning, increasing with increasing
age -towards republican institutions, which connects the
colonial history with that of the Union, and forms the
true point of view from which it is to be regarded.

Extractsfrom t/he Inaugural Address of the 3iayor oj
Boston.
OUR municipal charter requires that the mayor shall
communicate to the two branches of the City Council
such information, and recommend such measures, as may
promote the improvement and substantial interests of
5 Boston. It is not becoming that I should enter even upon
this minor and incipient duty without tendering, as I now
do; through you, to my fellow-citizens, my grateful aclknowledgments for the confidence with Nvhich they have seen
fit to honor me.
10   At present, all that I can offer in exchange for an unsought and unexpected demonstration of popular favor, is
the solemn promise that I will faithfully devote whatever
energies I possess to the promotion of the public welfare,
unswayed by any other considerations or influence than
15 my deliberate convictions of right.
I am fully aware that in the discharge of my officiai
duties I must come in collision with the interests, the
prejudices, the passions, of a greater or less number of
my constituents, and am perfectly content to abide the re20 sult. Such has, been the fortune of all my predecessors,.and I cannot expect to fare better than they.
Much as I value the good will and love of the people
among whom I have dwelt these thirty winters, yet, if ii
happen that, in consequence of pursuing the course which
25 my judgment and conscience may approve, my administration should'fail to be acceptable to the popular majority,
I shall retire to private life with far more pleasure than I
experience in assuming the responsibilities of office.
Boston and its environs, within a radius of five miles,
30 contains at least two hundred and ten thousand inhabitants. The city proper has about one hundred and thirty
thousand inhabitants, with an assessed valuation' of one
hundred alnd sixty-seven millions of dollars. So large an
accumulation of people and wealth on a single spot, within
35 a region of our country so little favored by nature, could
hardly have been anticipated.
The sterile soil, the rugged surface, the stern climate,
and the want of navigable streams, in New England, would
seem to have rendered it improbable that it would ever be

should arise within its borders. It would seem that
such would exist only within the more central or southerly portions of the Union, under more genial skies, and
in the vicinity of the great natural routes of intercom5 munication.
But the resolution and intelligent industry of our fathers
surmounted every obstacle. The region, sneeringly stigmatized as having no natural productions for export but
" granite and ice," now teems with three millions of the
10 children of freedom, abounding in the comforts of civilized life- and its metropolis ranlks with the great cities
of the globe.
It is to be borne in mind also, that that metropolis became an important city long before science and art had
1.5 cut in sunder the hills, elevated the vales, and spanned
the running waters, to unite her commerce in easy and
rapid communication with more favored climes. If our
people could achieve a position so prominent while destitute of any of the facilities of intercourse with the inte20 rior with which the cities of the sunny South are so
abundantly blessed, what may we not expect of the future
destiny of Boston, now that her iron highways, extending
in all directions, bring her into convenient proximity with
every section of the land?
25   They who could effect so rnuch under the most repelling circumstances may be depended upon to avail themselves to the full of their new and ample advantages.
The long winter of New England isolation is broken, -
she warms and flourishes in friendly and thrifty inter30- course with the luxuriant West; and it is not too much to
anticipate that the day will come, when there will be no
greater or more prosperous city upon the American continent than the City of the Pilgrims.
This view of the prospects of Boston leads me to speak
35 of our schools,--education being the true basis of our
institutions, and the real secret of New England progress
and power. Our schools are believed never to have been
more deserving of confidence and support than at the
present time.
40   There are now in the city, sustained at the public
charge, one hundred and eighty-eight schools, with nineteen thousand and sixty-four pupils in attendance. There
has been expended from the treasury for these schools,
within the past year, three hundred and fortv-six tho,lu
340
[EX. L,Xtsand five hundred and seventy-two dollars, including the
amount paid on account of new edifices. There is no
expense which the people of Boston more willingly incur
than that which is necessary for the support of the pub5 lic schools; but it cannot be their intention to authorize
unnecessary outlays for this, or any other object whatever.
With this conviction, I cannot but regret what appears
to me to have been the extraordinary cost of erecting
10 some of the newer school-houses. The splendor of the
edifice is no guarantee for the education of the pupil; who
is as efficiently fitted for the great duties of life in the
older and less pretending seminaries of the city as in the
magnificent structures of the present period.

The erring and abandoned should be treated as children
of our common Father; but society should not be expected
to furnish costly accommodations for those who set its
authority at naught. A prison should never be built with
20 reference to show. It were better that it should be screened
from observation, rather than elicit encomiums upon its
architecture. In appearance, it can never be other than
a melancholy monument of the infirmities of our race;
and it is not wise to whiten or garnish the sepulcher of
25 shame.
During the year whose advent we gratefully salute this
morning, we are charged with duties of no ordinary responsibility. The action neither of the state nor national
30 governments bears with such immediate and sensible effects
upon the happiness of the great family whom we represent
as the conduct of their civic fathers. For our stewardship,

Adam's Description of his First State of Consciousness
As new waked from soundest sleep,
Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid,
In balmy sweat; which with his beams the sun
Soon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed.

As thitherward endeavoring, and upright

Halifax.
AmONG the statesmen of the age of Charles II., Halifax
was, in genius, the first. His intellect was fertile, subtle,
30 and capacious.  His polished, luminous, and animated
eloquence, set off by the silver tones of his voice, was the
delight of the House of Lords.
His conversation overflowed with thought, fancy, and
wit. His political tracts well deserve to be studied for
35 their literary merit, and fully entitle him to a place among
342
[EX. IXXXIEnglish classics. To the weight derived from n  lents so
great and various, he united all the influence which belongs
to rank and afnple possessions.
Yet he was less successful in politics than nlany who
5 eijoyed smaller advantages. Indeed, those intellectual
peculiarities which make his writings valuable frequently
impeded him in the contests of active life. For he always
saw passing events, not in the point of view in which they
commonly appear to one who bears a part in them, but in
10 the point of view in which, after the lapse of many years,
they appear. to the philosophic historian.
With such a turn of mind, he could not long continue
to act cordially with any body of men. All the prejudices,
all the exaggerations, of both the great parties in the state,
15 moved his scorn. He despised the mean arts and unreasonable clamors of demagogues. He despised still more
the Tory doctrines of divine right and passive obedience.
He sneered impartially at the bigotry of the Churchman
and the bigotry of the Puritan. He was equally unable to
20 comprehend how any man should object to saints' days and
surplices, and how any man should persecute any other
man for objecting to them.
In temper he was what, in our time, is called a conservative. In theory he was a republican. Even when his
25 dread of anarchy and his disdain for vulgar delusions led
him to side for a time with the defenders of arbitrary
power, his intellect was always with Locke and Milton.
Indeed, his jests upon hereditary monarchy were sometimes
such as would have better become a member of the Calf's
30 Head Club than a privy councilor of the Stuarts.
In religion he was so far from being a zealot, that lie was
called by the uncharitable an atheist: but this imputation
he vehemently repelled; and in truth, though he sometimes gave scandal by the way in which he exerted his
35 rare powers both of argumenltation and of ridicule on serious subjects, he seems to have been by no means unsusceptible of religious impressions.
He was the chief of those politicians whom the two
great parties contemptuously called Trimmers.  Instead
40 of quarreling with this nickname, he assumed it as a title
of honor, and vindicated, with great v4vacity, the dignity
of the appellation.
Everything good, he said, trims between extremes. The
temperate zone trims between the clinate in which men
Ex. LXXI.]
343
RHETORICAL REA-DING.PARKER'S EXERCISES IN
are roasted and the climate in which they are frozen. The
English Church trims between the Anabaptist madness
and the Papist lethargy. The English constitution trims
between Turkish despotism and Polish anarchy. Virtue
5 is nothing but a just temper between propensities, any one
of which, if indulged to excess, becomes vice. Nay, the
perfection of the Supreme Being himself consists in the
exact equilibrium of attributes, none of which could preponderate without disturbing the whole moral and physical
10 order of the world.
Thus Halifax was a trimmer on principle. He was also
a trimmer by the constitution both of his head and of his
heart. Hiq understanding was keen, skeptical, inexhaustibly fertile in distinctions and objections; his taste refined;
15 his sense of the ludicrous exquisite; his temper placid and
forgiving, but fastidious, and by no means prone either to
malevolence or to enthusiastic admiration.
Such a man could not long be constant to any band of
political allies. He must not, however, be confounded with
20 the vulgar crowd of renegades. For though, like them, he
passed from side to side, his transition was always in the
direction opposite to theirs. He had nothing in common
with those who fly from extreme to extreme, and who
regard the party which they have deserted with an animos
25 ity fair exceeding that of consistent enemies.
His place was between the hostile divisions of the com
munity, and he never wandered far beyond the frontier of
either. The party to wThich he at any moment belongec
was the party which, at that moment, he liked least, be30 cause it was the party of which, at that moment, he had
the nearest view. He was therefore always severe upon
his violent associates, and was always in friendly relations
with his moderate opponents.
Every faction, in the day of its insolent and vindictive
35 triumph, incurred his censure, and every faction, when
vanquished and persecuted, found in him a protector.  To
his lasting honor it must be mentioned, that he attempted
to save those victims whose fate has left the deepest stain
both on the Whigs and on the Tory name.
40   He had greatly distinguished himself in opposition, and
had thus drawn on himself the royal displeasure, which
was indeed so strong that he Wvas not admitted into the
council of thirty without much difficulty and long altercation. As soon, however, as he had obtained a footing at
344
LEX. LXXXI.court, the charms of his manner and of his conversation
made him a favorite.
He was seriously alarmed by the violence of the public
discontent. He thought that liberty was for the present
5 safe, and that order and legitimate authority were in danger  He therefore, as was his fashion, joined him,lf to
the weaker side. Perhaps his conversion was not wholly
disinterested. For study and reflection, though they had
emancipated him from many vulgar prejudices, had left
10 him a slave to vulgar desires.
Money he did not want; and there is no evidence that
he ever obtained it by any means which, in that age, even
severe censors considered as dishonorable; but rank and
power had strong attractions for him. He pretended, in15 deed, that he considered titles and great offices as baits
iwhich could allure none but fools, that he hated business,
pomp and pageantry, and that his dearest wish was to
escape from the bustle and glitter of Whitehall to the
quiet woods which surrounded his ancient hail at Rufford;
20 but his conduct was not a little at variance with his professions. In truth, he wished to command the respect at once
of courtiers and of philosophers; to be admired for attaining
high dignities, and to be at the same time admired for
despising them.- Macaulay.

Hlotspur's Account of the Fop.
35       MY liege, I did deny no prisoners.
But I remember, when the fight was done,
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my swoid,Came there a certain lord; neat, trimly dressed;
Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin, new reaped,
Showed like a stubble land at harvest home.
He was perfumed like a milliner;
5  And'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
A pouncet-box, which, ever and anon,
He gave his nose
And still he smiled and talked:
And, as the soldiers bare dead bodies by,
10  He called them " untaught knaves, unmannerly,
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
Betwixt the wind and his nobility."
With many holiday and lady terms
He questioned me; amongst the rest, demanded
15 My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
I then, all smarting with my wounds, being galled
To be so pestered with a popinjay,
Out of my grief and my impatience,
Answered neglectingly -I know not what -
20  He should or should not; for he made me mad,
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet,
And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman,
Of guns, and drums, and wounds, (heaven save the mark!)
And telling me, the sovereign'st thing on earth
25  Was spermaceti for an inward bruise;
And that it was great pity (so it was)
This villanous saltpeter should be digged
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed
30 So cowardly; and but-for these vile guns--
He would himself have been a soldier.
This bald, unjointed chat of his, my lord,
I answered indirectly, as I said;
And I beseech you, let not his report

3etwixt my love and your high majesty.  Shakspeare.

Extract front an Address delivered before the Boston Mercantile Library Association, Oct., 1845.
COMMERCE has, in all ages, been the most formidable
antagonist of war. That great struggle far the mastery,

rAItKER7S EXERCISES INwhich has been going on, almost from the earliest syllable
of recorded time, upon the theatre of human life, and
which has been variously described and denominated,
according to the aspect in which it has been regarded, or
5 the object with which it was discussed - now as a struggle between aristocracy and democracy, and now as between the few and the many --has been little more than
a struggle between the mercantile and the martial spirit.
For centuries, and cycles of centuries, the martial spii-'t
10 has prevailed. The written history of the world is one
long bloody record of its triumph. And it cannot have
escaped any one, how, during the periods of its sternest
struggles, it has singled out the commercial spirit as its
most formidable foe.
15   Look at ancient Sparta, for example; the state which,
more than any other, was organized upon a purely war
principle; though, to the credit of its founder be it spoken,
with the view of defending its own territories, and not of
encroaching upon the dominions of others. What was the
20 first great stroke of policy adopted by the Lacedaemonian
lawgiver to secure the supremacy of the martial spirit?
What did he primarily aim to accomplish by his extraordinary enactments in relation to food, currency, education,
honesty and labor, of all sorts?
25   A Lacedemonian, happening to be at Athens when the
court was sitting, was informed of a man who had just
been fined for idleness. "Let me see the person," exclaimed he, " who has been condemned for keeping up his
dignity!" What was the philosophy-of the black broth, the
30 iron money, the consummate virtue of successful theft, the
sublime dignity of idleness? It was the war system,
intrenching itself, where alone it could be safe, on the
ruins of commerce! The annihilation of trade, and all
its inducements, and all its incidents -the extermination
35 of the mercantile spirit, root and branch --this was the
only mode which the sagacious Lycurgus could devisb for
maintaining the martial character of Sparta.
Plato, who knew something of the practical value of
commerce, if it be true that it was by selling oil in Egypt
40 that he was enabled to defray the expenses of those travels

citizens should not engage in commerce, because they
would be accustomed to find pretexts for justifying conduct
so inconsistent with what was manly and becoming, as
would relax the strictness of the military spirit; adding,
5 that it had been better for the Athenians to have continlued
to send annually the sons of seven of their principal
citizens to be devoured by the Minotaur, than to have
changed their ancient manners, and become a maritime
power.
10   It is this irreconcilable hostility between the mercantile
and the martial spirit which has led heroes, in all ages, to
despise and deride the pursuits of trade - from the heroes
of the Homeric age of ancient Greece, with whom a pirate
is said. to have been a more respected character than a
15 merchant, to him of modern France, who could find no
severer sarcasm for his most hated foes than to call them
"a nation of shopkeepers.".
The madman of Macedonia, as he-is sometimes called,
but to whom, by one having occasion for military talents,
20 might well have been applied the remark of George the
Second, in reference to General Wolfe, that he wished, if
Wolfe were mad, he could have bitten some of the rest
of his generals -after he had overrun almost the whole
habitable earth, did, indeed, in despair of-finding any more
25 dominions on the land to conquer, turn to the sea, to obtain
fresh opportunity for gratifying his insatiate ambition.
He projected a voyage for his fleet, from the Indus to
the mouth of the Euphrates. Commercial views are
sometimes regarded as having mingled with the ambition
30 which prompted this undertaking. It has been called the
first event of general importance to mankind in the history of commerce and navigation, and' has been thought
worthy of being commemorated, on the page of its learned
historian, by a medallion, on which the head of its heroic
35 projector is illuminated by the proud inscription, " aperiam
terras gentibus."
Let us transport ourselves, gentlemen, for an instant,
to a region recently rendered familiar by the events of
Afghanistan and Scinde; and, turning back the page of
40 history fo-r a little more than two thousand years, catch a
glimpse of the character and circumstances of this memorable voyage.
Alexander, it seems, is at first sorely puzzled to find
any one willing to assume the hazardous dignity of leadingsuch an expedition. At length, Nearchus, a Cretan, is
pressed into the- service, and is duly installed as admiral
of the fleet. Two thousand transports and eighty galleys,
of thirty oars each, are laboriously fitted out, and the hero
5 accompanies them in person, in a perilous.passage, down
the Indus to the ocean.
He approaches the mighty element, not in that mood
of antic and insolent presumption which other madmen
before and since have displayed on similar occasions. He
10 throws no chains upon it, as Xerxes is narrated to have
done, a century and a half earlier. He orders no host of
spearmen to charge upon it, as Caligula did, three or four
centuries afterwards.
He does not even venture to try the effect of his impe15 rial voice, in hushing its stormy billows, and bidding its
proud waves to stay themselves at his feet, as Canute did,
still a thousand years later. On the contrary, he humbles
himself before its sublime presence -he offers splendid
sacrifices, and pours out rich libations to its divinities,
20 and puts up fervent prayers for the success and safety of
his fleet.
Nearchus is then directed to wait two months for a
favorable monsoon. But a revolt of certain savage tribes
in the neighborhood compels him to anticipate its arrival,
25 and he embarks and enters upon his voyage. At the end
of six days,- two of which, however, were passed at anchor,
-the fleet hbad advanced rather more than nine miles!
After digging away a bar at the mouth of the Indus, a
little more progress is made, and a sandy island reached,
30 on which all hands are indulged with a day's rest.
Again the anchors are weighed, but soon again the
violence of the winds suspends all operations; the whole
host are a second time landed, and remain upon shore for
four-and-twenty days. Once more the voyage is renewed;
35 but once more the winds rage furiously; two of the galleys and a transport are sunk in a gale, and their crews
are seen swimming for their lives.
A third time all hands disembark and fortify a camp.
The long-expected monsoon at length sets in, and they
40 start afresh, and with such accelerated speed as to accomplish thirty-one miles in the first twenty-four hours. But
then, a four days' battle with the natives far more than
counterbalances this unlooked-for speed.  Soon after,
however, a pilot is fallen in with, who engages to conduct
45 them to the Persian Gulf.

Under his auspices, they venture for the first time to
sail by night, when they can have the benefit of the land
breeze, and when the rowers, relieved from the heat of the
sun, can exert themselves to better advantage. And now
5 they are making almost twice as many miles in the twentyfour hours as before, when lo! a new trouble arrests their
course. Huge columns of water are seen thrown up into
the air before them. The explanation of the pilot, that
they are but the sportful spoutings of a huge fish, only adds
10 to their alarm. If such be his sport, what must his wrath
be? All hands drop their oars in a panic!
The admiral, however, exhorts them to dismiss their
fears, and directs them, when a whale advances towards
them, to bear down upon it bravely, and scare'it from their
15 path with shouts, and dashing of oars, and sounding of
trumpets i The entrance of the Persian Gulf, a distance
of about six hundred miles, is at length reached; the first
and most difficult stage of the enterprise is accomplished;
and the admiral, having hauled all his vessels ashore, and
20 fortified them by a double intrenchment, proceeds to give
the joyful tidings to his imperial master, who has kept
along at no great distance from him on the coast, and they
unite in offering the sacrifices of thanlksgiving to Jupiter,
Apollo, Hercules, Neptune, and I know not how many other
25 deities of land, air, and ocean!
Such is a summary sketch of this first event of general
importance to mankind in the history oT navigation; an
event which, though its details may excite the laughter of
a Nantucket or New Bedford whaleman, or even of a
30 Marblehead or a Barnstable sailor boy, was counted among
the gravest and grandest exploits of that unrivaled hero
of antiquity, who took Achilles for his model, and could
not sleep without Aristotle's copy of the Iliad under his
pillow.
35  -If any commercial views are justly ascribed to the projector of such an expedition, it furnishes an early and
striking illustration of the idea, which the general current
of history has since confirmed, that the mercantile and
martial spirits were never to be the subjects of reconcilia40 tion and compromise, nor commerce destined to be seen
yoked to the car, and decorating the triumph, of military
ambition.
At all events, it supplies an amusing picture of the navigation.of those early days, and shows how poorly provided
352
[E:. LxxXV.and appointed was the mercantile spirit of antiquity for its
great mission of civilization and peace. Transports and
triaconters, skimming along the coast without a compass,
and propelled by oarsmen who were panic-stricken at the
5 spouting of a whale, were not the enginery by which commnerce was to achieve its world-wide triumphs.
And it was another admiral than Nearchus, not yielding
himself reluctantly to the call of an imperious sovereign,
but prompted by the heroic impulses of his own breast,
10 and offering up his prayers and oblations at another shrine
than that of Jupiter or Neptune, who, in a still far distant
age, was to open the world to the nations, give the commercial spirit sea-room, and lend the original impulse to
those great movements of navigation and trade by which
15 the whole face of society has been transformed.
Well might the mail-clad monarchs of the earth refuse
their countenance to Columbus, and reward his matchless
exploit with beggary and chains. He projected, he accomplished that, which, in its ultimate and inevitable conse20 quences, was to wrest from their hands the implements of
their ferocious sport --to break their bow and snap their
spear in sunder, and all but to extinguish the source of
their proudest and most absolute prerogative.
"No kingly conqueror, since time began'25        The long career of ages, hath to man
A scope so ample given for Trade's bold range,
Or caused on eartlh's wide stage such rapid, mighty change."
From the discovery of the new world, the mercantile
spirit has been rapidly gaining upon its old antagonist;
30 and the establishment upon these shores of our own republic -whose Union was the immediate result of commercial
necessities, whose independence found its original impulse
in commercial oppressions, and of whose constitution the
regulation of commerce was the first leading idea--may
35 be regarded as the epoch at which the martial spirit finally
lost a supremacy which, it is believed- and trusted, it can
never re-acquire.
Yes, it is commerce which is fast exorcising the fell
spirit of war from nations which it has so long been tearing
40 and rending. The merchant may, indeed, almost be seen
at this moment summoning the rulers of the earth to his
counting-desk, and putting them under bonds to keep the
jreace.

English Travellers.
IN the present age of high literary activity, travelers
make not the least important demands on public attention,
and their lucubrations, under whatever name -- Rambles,
Notices, Incidents, Pencilings - are nearly as important
15 a staple for the " trade " as novels and romances. A book
of travels, formerly, was a very serious affair. The traveler set out on his distant journey with many a solemn
preparation, made his will, and bade adieu to his friends
like one who might not again return. If he did return,'20'he results were embodied in a respectable folio, or at least
quarto, well garnlished with cuts, and done up in a solid
form, which argued that it was no fugitive publication, but
destined for posterity.
All this is changed. The voyager nowadays leaves
25 home with as little ceremony and leave-taking as if it
were for a morning's drive. He steps into the bark that
is to carry him across thousands of miles of ocean, with
the moral certainty of. returning in a fixed week, almost
at a particular day. Parties of gentlemen and ladies go
30 whizzing along in their steamships over the track which
cost so many weary days to the Argonauts of old, and run
over the choicest scenes of classic antiquity, scattered
through Europe,/Asia, and Africa, in less time than it
formerly took to go from one end of the British isles to
35 the other.
The Cape of Good Hope, so long the great stumblingblock to the navigators of Europe, is doubled, or the Red
Sea coasted, in the same way, by the fashionable tourist,PARKER'S EXERCISES INI

limits of Alexander's conquests - before the last leaves of
the last new novel which he has taken by the way are
5 fairly cut. The facilities of communication have, in fact,
so abridged distances, that geography, as we have hitherto
studied it, may be said to be entirely reformed. Instead
of leagues, we now compute by hours, and we find ourselves next-door neighbors to those whom we had looked
10 upon as at the antipodes.
The consequence of these imrprovements in the means
of intercourse is, that all the world goes abroad, or, at
least, one half is turned upon the other. Nations are so
mixed up by this process that they are in some danger of
15 losing their idiosyncrasy; and the Egyptian and the
Turk, though they still cling to their religion, are becoming European in their notions and habits more and more
every day.  
The taste for pilgrimage, however, it must be owned,
20 does not stop with the countries where it can be carried
on with such increased facility. It has begotten a nobler
spirit of adventure, something akin to what existed in the
fifteenth century, when the world was new, or newly discovering, and a navigator who did not take in sail, lilke
25 the cautious seamen of Knickerbocker, might run' down
some strange continent in the dark; for in these times of
dandy tourists and travel-mongers, the boldest achievements, that have hitherto'defied the most adventurous
spirits, have been performed: the Himmaleh Mountains
30 have been scaled, the Niger ascended, the burning heart
of Africa penetrated, the icy Arctic and Antarctic explored,
and the mysterious monuments of the semi-civilized races
of Central America have been thrown open to the public
gaze. It is certain that this is a high-pressure age, and
35 every departmlent of science and letters, physical and mental, feels its stimulating influence.
No nation, on the whole, has contributed so largely to
these itinerant exhibitions as the English. Uneasy, it
would seem, at being cooped up in their little isle, they
40 sally forth in all directions, swarming over the cultivated
and luxurious countries of the neighboring continent, oi
sending out stragglers on other more distant and formidable missions.  Whether it be that their soaring spirits are

signed them, or that there exists a supernumerary class of
idlers, who, wearied with the monotony of home, and the
same dull round of dissipation, seek excitement in strange
scenes and adventures; or whether they go abroad for the
5 sunshine, of which they have heard so much but seen so
little - whatever be the cause, they furnish a far greater
number of tourists than all the world besides. We Americans, indeed, may compete with them in mere locomotion,
for our familiarity~ with magnificent distances at home
10 makes us still more indifferent to them abroad; but this
locomotion is generally in the way of business, and the
result is rarely shown in a book, unless, indeed, it be the
ledger.
Yet John Bull is, on many accounts, less fitted than
15 most of his neighbors for the duties of a traveler.  However warm and hospitable in his own home, he has a cold
reserve in his exterior, a certain chilling atmosphere, which
he carries along with him, that freezes up the sympathies
of strangers, and which is only to be completely thawed
20 by long and intimate acquaintance. But the traveler has
no time for intimate acquaintances. He must go forward,
and trust to his first impressions, for they will also be his
last.
Unluckily, it rarely falls out that the first impressions
25 of honest John are very favorable. There is too much
pride, not to say hauteur, in his cormposition, which, with
the best intentions in the world, will show itself in a way
not particularly flattering to those who come in contact
with him. He goes through a strange nation, treading on
30 all their little irritable prejudices, shocking their self-love
and harmless vanities - in short, going against the grain,
and roughing up everything by taking it the wrong way.
Thus he draws out the bad humors of the people among
whom he moves, sees theni in their most unamiable and
35 by no means natural aspect - in short, looks on the wrong
side of the tapestry. What wonder if his notions are
somewhat awry as to what he sees! There are, it is true,
distinguished exceptions'to all this: English travelers,
who cover the warm heart  as warm as it is generally
40 true and manly - under a kind and sometimes cordial
manner; but they are the exceptions. The Englishman
undoubtedly appears best on his own soil, where his national predilections and prejudices, or, at least, the intimation of them, are somewhat mitigated in deference to his
45 guest.

[EX. LXXX.
Another source of the disqualification of John Bull as
a calm and philosophic traveler is the manner in which
he has been educated at home; the soft luxuries by which
he has been surrounded from his cradle have made luxu5 ries necessaries, and, accustomed to perceive all the machinery of life glide along as noiselessly and as swiftly as
the foot of Time itself, he becomes morbidly sensitive to
every temporary jar or derangement in the working of it.
In no country, since the world was made, have all the
10 appliances for mere physical, and, we may add, intellectual indulgence, been carried to such perfection as in this
little island nucleus of civilization. Nowhere can a man
get such returns for his outlay. The whole organization
of society is arranged so as to minister to the comforts of
15 the wealthy; and an Englishman, with the golden talisman in his pocket, can bring about him genii to do his
bidding, and transport himself over distances with a
thought, almost as easy as if he were the possessor of
Aladdin's magic lamp, and the fairy carpet of the Arabian
20 Tales.
When he journeys over his little island, his comforts
and luxuries cling as close to him as round his own fireside. He rolls over roads as smooth and well-beaten as
those in his own park; is swept onward by sleek and well25 groomed horses, in a carriage as soft and elastic, and quite
as showy, as his own equipage; puts up at inns that may
vie with his own castle in their comforts and accommodations, and is received by crowds of obsequious servants,
more solicitous, probably, even than his own, to win his
30 golden smiles. In phort, wherever he goes, he may be
said to carry with him his castle, park, equipage, establishment. The whole are in movement together.    He
changes place, indeed, but changes nothing else. For
traveling, as it occurs in other lands - hard roads, harder
35 beds, and hardest fare -he knows no more of it than if
he had been.passing from one wing of his castle to the
other.
All this, it must be admitted, is rather an indifferent
preparation for a tour on the continent. Of what avail
40 is it that Paris is the most elegant capital, France the
most enlightened country, on the European terra firma,
if one cannot walk in the streets without the risk of being
run over for want of a trottoir, nor move on the roads
witholut being half smothered in a lumbering vehicle,dragged by ropes, at the rate of five miles an houir? Of
what account are the fine music and paintings, the aIchitecture and art, of Italy, when one must shiver by day for
want of carpets and sea-coalfires, and be thrown into a
5 fever at night by the active vexations of a still more tormenting kind? The galled equestrian might as well be
expected to feel nothing but raptures and ravishment at
the fine scenery through which he is riding. It is probable he will think much more of his own petty hurts than
]0 of the beauties of nature. A traveling John Bull, if his
skin is not off, is at least so thin-skinned that it is next
door to being so.
If the European neighborhood affords so many means
of annoyance to the British traveler, they are incalculably
15 multiplied on this side of the water, and that, too, under
circumstances which dispose him still less to charity in his
criticisms and constructions. On the continent he feels he
is among strange races, born and bred under different religious and political institutions, and, above all, speaking
20 different languages. He does not necessarily, therefore,
measure them by his peculiar standard, but allows them
one of their own. The dissimilarity is so great in all the
main features of national polity and society, that it is hard
to institute a comparison.
25   Whatever be his contempt for the want of progress and
perfection in the science of living, he comes to regard
them as a distinct race, amenable to different laws, and
therefore licensed to indulge in different usages, to a certain extent, from his own. If a man travels in China, he
30 makes up his mind to chop-sticks. If he should go to the
moon, he would not be scandalized by seeing people walk
with their heads under their arms. He has embarked on
a different planet. It is only in things which run parallel
to those in his own country that a comparison can be insti35 tutecl, and charity too often fails where criticism begins.
Unhappily, in America, the Englishman finds these
points of comparison forced on him at every step. He
lands among a people speaking the same language, professing the same religion, drinking at the same fountains
40 of literature, trained in the same occupations of active life.
The towns are built on much the same model with those
in his own land. The brick houses, the streets, the "' sidewalks," the in-door arrangements, all, in short, are near
enough on-the same pattern to provoke a comparison. Alas
31
EX. LXXXIX.]
361
RHETORICAL READING.for the comparison! The cities sink at once into mere
provincial towns; the language degenerates into a provincial patois; the manners, the fashions, down to the cut
of the clothes, and the equipages, all are provincial. The
5  people, the whole nation- as independent as any, certainly, if not, as our orators fondly descant, the best and
most enlightened upon earth- dwindle into a mere British
colony.
The traveler does not seem to understand that he is
10 treading the soil of the new world, where everything is
new, where antiquity dates but from yesterday, where the
present and the future are all and the past nothing, where
hope is the watchword and "Go ahead!" the principle
of action. He does not comprehend that when he sets
15 foot on such a land he is no longer to look for old hereditary landmarks, old time-honored monuments and institutions, old families that have vegetated on the same soil
since the Conquest. He must be content to part with the
order, and something of the decorum, incident to an old
20 community, where the ranks are all precisely and punctiliously defined, where the power is deposited by prescriptive right inl certain privileged hands; and where the great
mass have the careful obsequiousness of dependents, looking for the crumbs that fall.
25   He is now among a new people, where everything is in
movement, all struggling to get forward, and where, though
many go adrift in their wild spirit of adventure, and a
temporary check may be sometimes felt by all, the great
mass still advances. He is landed on a hemisphere where
30 fortunes are to be made, and men are employed in getting,
not in spending- a difference which explains so many of
the discrepancies between the structure of our own society
and habits and those of the old world. To know how to
spend is itself a science;, and the science of spending and
35 that of getting are rarely held by the same hand.
In such a state of things, the whole arrangement of society, notwithstanding the apparent resemblance to that in
his own country, and its real resemblance in minor points
is reversed. The rich proprietor, who does nothing but
40 fatten on his rents, is no longer at the head of the scale, as
in the old world. The man of enterprise takes the lead
in a bustling community, where action and progress,'or at
least change, are the very conditions of' existence. The
upper classes --if the term can be use(l in a complete'362
PARKER'S EXERCISES 1N
[Ex. LXXXIdemocracy -have not the luxurious finish and accommodations to be found in the other hemisphere. The humbler classes have not the poverty-stricken, cringing spirit
of hopeless inferiority. The pillar of society, if it want
5 the Corinthian capital, wants also the heavy and superfluous base. Every man not only professes to be, but is
practically, on a footing of equality with his neighbor. The
traveler must not expect to meet here the deference, or
even the courtesies, which grow out of distinction of castes.
10   This is an awkward dilemma for one whose nerves
have never been jarred by contact with the profane; who
has never been tossed about in the rough and tumble of
humanity. It is little to him that the poorest child in the
community learns how to read and write; that the poorest
15 man can have - what Henry the Fourth so good-naturedly
wished for the humblest of his subjects -a fowl in his
pot every day for his dinner; that no one is so low but
that he may aspire to all the rights of his fellow-men, and
find an open theater on which to display his own peculiar
20 talents.
As the tourist strikes into the interior, difficulties of all
sorts multiply, incident to a raw and unformed country.
The comparison with the high civilization at home becomes
more and more unfavorable, as he is made to feel that in
25 this ]and of promise it must be long before promise can
become the performance of the old world. And yet, if he
would look beyond the surface, he would see that much
here too has been performed, however much may be
wanting. He would see lands over which the wild Indian
30 roamed as a hunting-ground teeming with harvests for the
consumption of millions at home and abroad; forests,
which have shot up, ripened and decayed, on the same
spot ever since the creation, now swept away to make
room for towns and villages, thronged with an industrious
35 population; rivers, which rolled on in their solitudes,
undisturbed except by the wandering bark of the savage,
now brolcen and dimpled by hundreds of steamboats,
freighted with the rich tribute of a country rescued from
the wilderness.
40   He would not expect to meet the careful courtesies of
polished society in the pioneers of civilization, whose mission has been to recover the great continent from the bear
and the buffalo. He would have some charity for their
ignorance of the latest fashions of Bond-street, and thei1

departure, sometimes, even from what, in the old country, is
considered as the decorum, and, it may be, decencies of
life. But not so; his heart turns back to his own land,
and closes against the rude scenes around him; for he
5 finds here none of the soft graces of cultivation, or the hallowed memorials of an early civilization; no gray, weatherbeaten cathedrals, telling of the Normans; no Gothic
churches in their groves of venerable oaks; no moss-covered cemeteries, in which the dust of his fathers has been
10 gathered since the time of the Plantagenets; no rural
cottages, half smothered with roses and honeysuckles, intimating that even in the most humble abodes the taste for.the, beautiful has found its way; no trim gardens, and
fields blossoming with hawthorn hedges and miniature
15 culture; no ring fences, enclosing well-shaven lawns,
woods so disposed as to form a picture of themselves,
bright threads of silvery water, and sparkling fountains.
All these are wanting, and his eyes turn with disgust
from the wild and rugged features of nature, and all her
20 rough accompaniments -from man almost as wild; and
his heart sickens as he thinks of his own land, and all its
scenes of beauty. He thinks not of the poor, who leave
that land for want of bread, and find in this a kindly
welcome, and the means of independence and advancement
25 which their own denies them.
He goes on, if he be a splenetic Sinbad, discharging his
sour bile on everybody that he comes in contact with, thus
producing an amiable ripple in the current as he proceeds,
that adds marvelously, no doubt, to his own quiet and:30 personal comfort. If he have a true merry vein and
hearty good nature, he gets on, laughing sometimes in his
sleeve at others, and cracking his jokes on the unlucky
pate of Brother Jonathan, who, if he is not very silly--
which he very often is - laughs too, and joins in the jest,
35 though it may be somewhat at his own expense.
It matters little whether the tourist be Whig or Tory in
his own land; if the latter, he returns, probably, ten times
the conservative that he was when he left it. If Whig, or
even Radical, it matters not; his loyalty waxes warrrer
40 and warmer with every step of his progress among the
republicans; and he finds that practical democracy, shouldering and elbowing its neighbors as it "goes ahead,"
is no more like the deinocracy which he has been accustomed to admire in theory, than the real machinery, with

Extract of a Speech in the Senate of the United States, disavowing a 2National Hostility to Great Britain.
MR. PRESIDENT, we rlmust distinguish a little. That
there exists in this country an intense sentiment of nationality; a cherished energetic feeling and consciousness of
our independent and separate national existence; a feeling
5 that we have a transcendent destiny to fulfil, which we
mean to fulfill; a great work to do, which we know how
to do, and are able to do; a career to run, up which we
hope to ascend, till we stand on the steadfast and glittering
summits of the world; a feeling, that we are surrounded
10 and attended by a noble historical group of competitors
and rivals, the other nations of the earth, all of whom we
hope to overtake, and even to distance;- such a sentiment as this exists, perhaps, in the character of this
people.
15   And this I do not discourage; I do not condemn. It is
easy to ridicule it. But, "grand, swelling sentiments"
of patriotism, no wise man will despise. They have their
uses. They help to give a great heart to a nation; to
animnate it for the various conflicts of its lot; to assist it
20 to work out for itself a more exceeding weight, and to fill
a larger measure of glory. But, sir, that among these
useful and beautiful sentiments, predominant among them,
there exists a temper of hostility towards this one particular nation, to such a degree as to amount to a habit, a
25 trait, a national passion - to amount to a state of feeling
which "is to be regretted," and which really threatens
another war--this I earnestly and confidently deny. I
would not hear your enemy say this.
Sir, the indulgence of such a sentiment by the people.30 supposes them to have forgotten one of the counsels of
Washington. Call to mind the ever, seasonable wisdom
of the Farewell Address: "The nation which indulges
towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondness, is, in some degree, a slave. It is a slave to its ani35 mosity, or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to
lead it astray from its duty and its interest."
No, sir! no, sir! We are above all this. Let the
Highland clansman, half naked, half civilized, half blinded
by the peat-smoke of his cavern, have his hereditary enemy
40 and his hereditary enmity, and keep the keen, deep, and
366
LEX. XCLprecious hatred, set on fire of hell, alive if he can; let the
North American Indian have his, and hand it down from
father to son, by Heaven knows what symbols of alligators,
and rattle-snakes, and war-clubs, smeared with vermilion
5 and entwined with scarlet; let such a country as Poland,
- cloven to the earth, the armed heel on the radiant forehead, her body dead, her soul incapable to die,- let her
remember the "wrongs of days long past;" let the lost
and wandering tribes of Israel remember theirs - the man10 liness and the sympathy of the world may allow or pardon
this to them; - but shall America, young, free, prosperous,
just setting out on the hi(rhway of heaven, " decorating
and cheering the elevated sphere she just begins to move
in, glittering like the morning star, full of life and joy,"
15 shall she be supposed to be polluting and corroding her
noble and happy heart, by moping over old stories of stamp
act, and tea tax, and the firing of the Leopard upon the
Chesapeake in a time of peace?
No, sir! no, sir! a thousand times no! Why, I pro20 test I thought all that had been settled. I thought two
wars had settled it all. What else was so much good
blood shed for, on so many more than classical fields of
revolutionary glory? For what was so much good blood
more lately shed, at Lundy's Lane, at Fort Erie, before
25 and behind the lines at New Orleans, on the deck of the
Constitution, on the deck of the Java, on the lakes, on
the sea, but to settle exactly these "wrongs of past
days?"
And have we come back sulky and sullen from the
30 very field of honor?  For my country, I deny it. The
senator* says that our people still rermember these " former
scenes of wrong, with, perhaps, too deep" a sensibility;
and that, as I interpret him, they nourish a "too extensive" national enmity.  How so?  If the feeling he
35 attributes to them is moral,' manly, creditable, how comes
it to be too deep? and if it is immoral, unmanly, and
unworthy, why is it charged on them at all?
Is there a member of this body, who would stand up in
any educated, in any intelligent and right-minded circle
40 which he respected, and avow that, for his part, he must
acknowledge, that, looking baclc through the glories and
the atonement of two wars, his views were full of ill blood
to England; that in peace he could not help being her

convictions and "the immortal hate" of the old times?
Certainly, not one. And then, sir, that which we feel
would do no honor for ourselves shall we confess for our
5 country?
Mr. President, let me say, that in my judgment this
notion of a national enmity of feeling towards Great Britain, belongs to a past age of our history. My younger
countrymen are unconscious of it. They disavow it.
10 That generation, in whose opinions and feelings the
actions and the destiny of the next are unfolded, as the
tree in the germ, do not at all comprehend your meaning,
nor your fears, nor your regrets.
We are born to happier feelings. We look to England
15 as we look to France. We look to them, from our new
world,--not unrenowned, yet a new world still, --and
the blood mounts to our cheeks; our eyes swim; our
voices are stifled with emulousness of so much glory; their
trophies will not let us sleep: but there is no hatred at all;
20 no hatred --no barbarian memory of wrongs, for which
brave men have made the last expiation to the brave.

The Prodigal Son.
From The Gospel According to St. Luke, Chapter XV.
THEN drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners
for to hear him. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth
with them.
5   And he spake this parable unto them, saying, What
man of you having a hundred sheep, if he lose one of them,
doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and
go after that which he has lost, until he find it? And
when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders,
10 rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with. me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.
I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over
one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine
15 just persons which need no repentance.
Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she
lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the
house, and seek diligently till she find it? And when she
hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbors
20 together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the
piece which I had lost. Likewise, I say unto you, There
is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner
that repenteth.
And he said, A certain man had two sons: and the
25 younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the
portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto
them his living. And not many days after, the younger
son gathered all together, and tool his journey into a far
country, and there wasted his substance with riotous livinrv.
30 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighlty famite
in that land; and he began to be in want.
And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that
country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks
35 that the swine did eat; and no man gave unto him.
And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired
servants of my father's- have bread enough and to snare,
and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my

Harmlet's Advice to the Players.
SPEAK the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
35 trippingly, on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many

my lines. And do not saw the air too much with your
hand; but use all gently: for in the very torrent, tempest,
sX. xcv.;
371and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passr-. n, you must
acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. Oh! it offends me to the soul, to hear a robustious,
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags,
5  to split the ears of the groundlings; who, for the most part,
are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and
noise. Pray, you avoid it.
Be not too tame neither: but let your own discretion be'your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the
10 action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not
the modesty of nature: for anything so overdone is from
the purpose of playing, whose end is -to hold, as it,were,
the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her owvn feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the
15 time his form and pressure.
Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though it makes
the unskillful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve;
the censure of one of which must, in your allowance, o'erweigh a whole theater of others. Oh! there be players
20 that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that
highly, that, neither having the accent of Christian, nor
the gait of Christian, pagan nor man, have so strutted and
bellowed, that I have thought some of Nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them well; they imi25 tated humanity so abominably. - Shakspeare.

Intellectual Improvement.
THE great mass of mankind consider the intellectual
powers as susceptible of a certain degree of development
5 in childhood, to prepare the individual for the active duties
of life. This degree of progress they suppose to be made
before the age of twenty is attained, and hence they talk
of an education being finished!
Now, if a parent wishes to convey the idea that his
10 daughter has closed her studies at school, or that his son
has finished his preparatory professional course, and is
ready to commence practice, there is perhaps no strong
objection to his using of the common phrase, that the
education is finished; but in any general or proper use of
15 language, there is no such thing as a finished education.
The most successful student that ever left a school, or took
his degree at college, never arrived at a good place to stop,
in his intellectual course.
In fact, the further he goes the more desirous will he feel
2Q to go on; and if you wish to find an instance of the greatest eagerness and' interest with which the pursuit of knowledge is prosecuted, you will find it undoubtedly in the case
of the most accomplished and thorough scholar that the
country can furnish, one who has spent a long life in study,
25 and who finds that the further he goes the more and more
widely does the boundless field of intelligence open before
him.
Give up, then, at once, all idea of finishing your education. The sole object of the course of discipline at any
30 literary institution, in our land, is not to finish, but just to
show you how to begin; to give you an impulse and a
direction upon that course which you ought to pursue with
unabated and uninterrupted ardor as long as you have
being.
35   It is unquestionably true, that every person, whatever
are his circumstances or condition in life, ought at all times
to be making some steady-efforts to enlarge his stock of
knowledge, to increase his mental powers, and thus to ex[EX. xcv:

pand the field of his intellectual vision. I suppose most
of my readers are convinced of this, and are desirous, if
the way can only be distinctly pointed out, of making such
efforts.
5 In fact, no inquiry is more frequently made by intelligent
young persons than this:--  What course of reading shall
I pursue? What books shall I select, and what plan in
reading them shall I adopt? " These inquiries I now propose to answer. The objects of'study are of several kinds;
10 some of the most important I shall enumerate.
To increase our intellectual powers. - Every one knows
that there is a difference of ability in different minds, but
it is not so distinctly understood that every one's abilities
may be increased or strengthened by a kind of culture
15 adapted expressly to this purpose; -I mean a culture
which is intended not to add to the stock of knowledge,
but only to increase intellectual power.
Suppose, for example, that when Robinson Crusoe on
his desolate island had first found Friday the savage, he
20 had said to himself as follows:- " This man looks wild
and barbarous enough; he is to stay with me and help me
in my various plans; but he could help me much more
effectually if he were more of an intellectual being and
less of a mere animal. Now I can increase his intellectual
25 power by culture, and 1 will. But what shall I teach him?"
On reflecting a little further upon the subject, he would
say to himself as follows:-", I must not always teach him
things necessary for him to know in order to assist me in
my work, but 1 must try to teach him to think for himself
30 Then he will be far more valuable as a servant than if he
has to depend upon me for everything he does."
Accordingly, some evening when the two, master and
man, have finished the labors of the day, Robinson is
walking upon the sandy beach, with the wild savage by
35 his side, and he concludes to give him his first lesson in
mathematics. He picks up a slender and pointed shell,
and with it draws carefully a circle upon the sand.
"What is that?" says Friday. "It is what we call a circle," says Robinson. " I want you now to come and stand
40 here, and attentively consider what I. am going to tell you
about it."
Now Friday has, we will suppose, never given his serious attention to anything, or rather he has never made a
serious mental effort upon any subject for five minutes at
EX. XCVII,]
375376                PARKER'S EXERCISES IN          LEX. XCVII.
a time in his life. The simplest mathematical principle is
a complete labyrinth of perplexity to him. He comes up
and looks at the smooth and- beautiful curve which his
master has drawn in the sand with a gaze of stupid amaze5 ment.
"Now listen carefully to what I say," says Robinson,
"and see if you can understand it. Do you see this little
point I make in the iniddle of the circle?"  Friday says
he does, and woIlders'what is to come from the magic
10 character which he sees before him. "This," continues
Robinson, " is a circle, and that point is the center. Now,
if I draw lines from the center in any direction to the outside, these lines will all be equal."
So saying, he draws several lines. He sets Friday to
15 measuring them. Friday sees that they are equal, and is
pleased from two distinct causes; one, that he has successfully exercised his thinking powers, and the other, that he
has learned something which he never knew before.
I wish now that the reader would understand that Rob20 inson does not take this course with Friday because he
wishes him to understand the nature of the circle. Suppose we were to say to him, " Why did you choose such a
lesson as that for your savage?  You can teach him
much more useful things than the properties of the circle.
25 What good will it do him to know how to make circles?
Do you expect him to draW geometrical diagrams for you,
or to calculate and project eclipses?."
"No," Robinson would reply; "I do not care to make
Friday understand the properties of the circle.  But I
30 would have him to be a thinking being; and if I can induce
him to think half an hour steadily and carefully, it is of no
consequence upon what subject his thoughts are employed.
I chose the circle because that seemed easy and distinct -
suitable for the first lesson. I do not know that he will
35 ever have occasion to make use of the fact, that the radii
of a circle are equal, as long as he shall live- but he will
have occasion for the power of patient attention and thought,
which he acquired while attempting to understand that
subject."
40   This would unquestionably be sound philosophy, and a
savage who should study such a lesson on the beach of his
own wild island would forever after be less of a savage
than before. The effect upon his mental powers of one
single effort like that would last; and a series of sucheffoirts would transform him from a fierce and ungovernable,
but stupid animal, to a cultivated and intellectual man.
Thus it is w-ith all education. One great object is to
increase the powers, and this is entirely distinct from the
5 acquisition of knowledge. Scholars very often ask, when
pursuing some difficult study, " What good will it do mne
toknow this? " But that is not the question. They ought
to ask, " What good will it do me to learn it? What effect
upon my habits of thinking, and upon my intellectual powers,
10 will be produced by the efforts to examine and to conquer
these difficulties? "
A very fine example of this is the study of conic sections,
a difficult branch of the course of mathematics pursued in
college; a study which, from its difficulty and its apparent
15 uselessness, is often very unpopular in the class pursuing
it. The question is very often asked, " What good will it
ever do us in after-life to understand all these mysteries of
the parabola, and the hyperbola, and the ordinates, and
abscissas, and asymtotes?"
20   The answer is, that the knowledge of the facts which
you acquire will probably do you no good whatever. That
is not the object, and every college officer knows full well
that the mathematical principles which this science demonstrates are not brought into use in after-life by one scholar
25 in ten. But every college officer, and every intelligent
student who will watch the operations of his own mind
and the influences which such exercises exert upon it,
knows equally well that the study of the higher mathematics produces an effect in enlarging and disciplining the
30 intellectual powers, which the whole of life will not obliterate.
Do not shrink, then, from difficult work in your efforts at
intellectual improvement. You ought, if you wish to secure the greatest advantage, to have some difficult work,
35 that you'may acquire habits of patient research, and increase and strengthen your intellectual powers. --J. Abbott

Woman.
THE'first and necessary relation of woman is that of
daughter. From this relation numerous duties arise, for
the performance of which every woman should be educated  A daughter is the natural companion, friend and
35 stay, of her parents. A man leaves his father and mother,
and marries into the falnily of his wife. But h. our own
and other free countries, a woman, whether single or married, more frequently remains with her earliest affections
in or near the mansion of her parents
378[EX. XCkl:.RHETORICAL READING.
It is to her that they naturally look for the tender affections which will soothe them in their declining vears. It
is for her to temper the rough winds of adversity, and render brighter the sunshine of prosperity. She is their corn5 forter, physician, and nurse. When their voice has become
tremulous, and their eye dim with age, and the stores of
memory have been closed, it is for her to bring forth the
pleasures of consolation, to make the sound of gladness
still be heard in their dwelling, and to fill it with a cheer10 ful, and--if she have been rightly educated - a holy
light.
I need not speak particularly of the relation of the sister:
not that I undervalue the importance of her duties; but
because I believe that the woman who is well educated for
15 the more important ones of daughter and wife cannot fail
to be a faithful sister and friend. We have merely time to
glance at the numerous duties of the mistress of a family.
Enter the humblest dwelling under the prudent management of a discreet and well-educated female, and observe
20 the simplicity and good taste which pervade it. The wise
mistress has nothing gaudy in her dress or furniture; for
she is above the silly ambition of surpassing her neighbors
in show. Her own best ornaments are cheerftlness and
contentment; and those of her house are neatness, good
25 order and cleanliness, which make a plain house and modest apartments seem better than they are.
She has not the selfish vanity which would make her
strive to appear above her circumstances. She knows
what are, and what ought to be, the expenses of her fam30 ily; and she is not ashamed of her economy. It gives her
the means of being liberal in her charity; and hers is a
charity which reaches round the earth, and embraces the
poor and unfortunate everywhere.
Her domestics, if she have any, look to her for advice
35 in doubt, and counsel in difficulties; they respect her judgment, for she has shown herself wise and disinterested;
they see that she cares for them, and they have felt her
sympathy in their sorrows: in return, they make her interest their own, anticipate her wishes, and show the willing40 ness of their service by their cheerful alacrity.
She knows the virtue of pure air, and the excellence of
scrupulous cleanliness; she can judge of the qualities of

EXERCISE C1.
Association of Ideas.
IT is the law or usage of the human mind long to retain
any connection, even of the most accidental kind, which
has once been formed between two or more thoughts or
states of feeling. I1f one of these linked or associated
5 ideas is brought back to the mind, the other, most often,
returns with it. No one can need instances of this sort
to be mentioned, for every moment presents them to every
mind.
It is, however, important to distinguish what may be
10 called -the natural or spontaneous association of ideas,
from that which is the consequence of certain habits of
the mind. The law of spontaneous association shows
itself most completely in dreaming, when ideas of all
kinds follow one the other, in a disorderly and fantastic
15 manner; and yet so that we can (when dreams are recollected with sufficient distinctness) often perceive the link
or tie which made one image succeed to another.
In musing or revery the same law of accidental connection makes itself apparent in the succession of ideas and
20 emotions. The prattle of children, and the' idle chat of
uncultivated or frivolous persons, very commonly present
the same sort of fortuitous succession of ideas, connected
only by incidental and unimportant circumstances of similarity or of jtxtaposition, in time or place. The strength
25 and culture of the mind may be fairly estimated by the
degree in which it ordinarily yields itself to this current
of spontaneous or accidental associations.
When certain habits of mind have been formed and
settled by exercise and application, they displace and su30 persede, to a great extent, the law of accidental association. A mind naturally vigorous, and which has acqulired
much control over its movements, and has addicted itself
to particular employments, no longer follows the fortuitous
course of ideas; but pursues, in some chosen path, the
35 real or rational connection of ideas one with another.
That is to say, the idea which follows the one last present
to the mind will be that which, in fact and nature, is the
most nearly related to its predecessor.
Thus, if the whole series of ideas were expressed or
40 uttered, those who listened to it would not have to search
382
[EX.'c.for the link which connected one thought with another,
but would perceive it in the very nature of the subject.
The mathematician, the mechanician, the statesman,
the poet, the artist, the man of business, each acquires his
5 proper habit of association, and each is prompt and successful in his line just in proportion to the rationality and
the closeness of the connections that have been formed in
his mind. This principle of the association of ideas is
sometimes, or by some writers, called the law of sugges10 tion. The meaning of the two phrases is much the same.
ATTENTION.
Not even the most frivolous, childish, or feeble mind, is
always or entirely governed by the fortuitous association
of ideas (spoken of in the preceding article.)  Nor how
strong soever may be any particular habit of thinking, is
15 any mind absolutely incapable of breaking off its customary meditations, and of fixing itself upon another set of
ideas. Every one is conscious of possessing a power
(more or less perfect) of detaining some one thought or
class of thoughts in the mind, and of considering or view20 ing a particular subject successively, in all its parts and
relations. This power is called attention.
It is the proper and distinguishing' excellence of the
human mind; and, in connection with the faculty of abstraction, forms the essential difference between man and
25 the brute, as well intellectually as morally. The degree
in which it is possessed distinguishes also one human
mind from another.
The exertion of this power of attention supposes some
motive or desire to be present, or some inducement to be
30 within view, which attracts the mind in one direction
rather than another. It is a great excellence in the men.
tal conformation, when a tranquil motive will insure a
high degree of attention; and moreover, when attention
can be readily and fully transferred from one object to
35 another; and it is a still higher excellence when attention
can be given, in an efficient degree, to several objects at
the same time.
A sluggish mind is one which can be roused to attention only by the most urgent or stimulating motives. A
40 weak mind is one that may be quickly roused to attention,
but which as quickly spends itself by the effort. An acute
mind is one that is capable of a very vigorous, momentary
EX. Cl.]
383
RHETORICAL READING.effort. A profound mind is one capable of long-continued
attention upon the same subject, and which can sustain
its attention by motives of the most tranquil sort.
A comprehensive and efficient mind is capable both of
5 long-continued efforts of attention, and of what may be
called multifarious attention; that is to say, it does not lose
itself in its regard to a single class of ideas, but sees all
objects in their various connections and dependencies.
Yet whatever may be the natural power of the mind in
19 these respects, it is susceptible of vast increase and improvement, by a well-conducted education. Indeed the
difference between an educated and uneducated person
(supposing their natural faculties to have been equal) is
manifested in nothing so conspicuously as in the greater
15 command over its powers of attention which the former
has acquired.
ABSTRACTION.
[From Abstraho, to draw off, or to draw apart, or to separate and take away one
thing from among a number.]
Things that differ very greatly one from another are
often found to be alike in some single quality; and when
this one quality is distinctly taken notice of, we readily
20 learn to think of it apart from the other qualities with
which it may have been joined, and thus the mind acquires
the habit of drawing off certain properties of things, and
of giving names to them; this habit is, called abstraction,
and the words employed on such occasions are called ab25 stract terms.
There are, for instance, placed before us, a cricket-ball,
a marble, a glass bubble, an apple, and an orange; and
we are asked if these things are alike. We answer, No:
for the first is brown, and may be indented; the second is
30 heavy and impenetrable; the third is-transparent and fragile, and light; the fourth is green and pulpy; the fifth is
yellow and fragrant.
But is there, then, no respect wherein they are alike?
Yes; they are alike in shape, or form-- they are round.
35 Roundness, then, is the quality or circumstance in which
these five objects agree, and which may be thought of, and
spoken of, apart.from the weight, hardness, color or smell,
of these five things. Thus we have obtained two abstract
ideas- namely, that of form or figure, and that of round40 ness; roundness being a particular sort of formn.
Examples of this kind are easily multiplied; we will
384
PARKER,7S EXERCISES IN
[EX. CItake another. Water, and glass, and spirits, and diamonds,
admit the rays of light to pass through them; so that objects may be discerned almost as clearly when they intervene as when they are removed.    Some other bodies
5 possess the same quality in a le'ss degree; such as amber,
and the amethyst, and the ruby, &amp;c. We want a name
for this property, belonging as it does to things so different
as water, glass, and stones; and we call it transparency.
Each of the five senses has its class of abstractions:
1  that is to say, each sense separates single qualities from
other qualities, discerned by itself, or by othe; senses.'ihe eye separates redness from yellowness, or whiteness,
&amp;c., and brightness from dulness;- and again, separates
color from figure; and it separates color and figure from. 6 the notions obtained by the other senses, such as hardness,
or weight, or fragrancy, or fluidity. The sense of taste
not only distinguishes sour from sweet and bitter, but separates them from the qualities that are made known to the
mind by the sense of touch, as heat and cold, asperity and
20 softness, &amp;c.
Thus it is that likeness, or sameness of quality, in things
otherwise unlike, leads the mind to form abstract notions,
and to use abstract words. But having acquired this habit,
it employs the power of separation in many other instances
25 than those that belong to the five senses. For example:If a man restores freely the property of another, which he
could not have been compelled to relinquish; or if he
speaks the exact truth when it might have been advantageous to him to utter a falsehood; or if in any way he
30 regards the welfare of other men, when he is tempted to
secure his own benefit, -we form a notion which we separate from the particular circumstances that may have
belonged to the man's conduct: we feel that there is a
peculiar quality that belongs to his conduct on all these
35 several occasions, and we call it integrity; and the so acting is justice.
Justice is not the name of one action, or of one kind of
an action; but of the abstract notion which belongs to any
action wherein a man pays strict regard to the rights and
41 property of others. Or if, in his actions, he goes beyond
what might have been demanded of him; if he prefers the
welfare of his neighbor to his own; then we form the notion of another sort of quality, and call it generosity or
kindness. And in any new instance, even if all the cir2:1
EX. cI.l
I=
RHETORICAL READING.PAIRKERI'S EXERCISES IN
cumstances are different, yet if a friend or stranger confers
upon us a benefit which he might properly have withheld,
we are reminded of the notion we had before formed, and
call the action or the person generous.
5    Some abstract notions are simple; that is to say, they
cannot be described or made known otherwise than by
single words, or by pointing to the objects in which they
are to be seen or felt. Such are redness, whiteness, heat,
cold, sweetness, pleasure, pain, and many others. If the
10 person to whom we would convey our meaningf has never
himself perceived the quality we are speaking of, we cannot impart to him our idea by words; or, if he does not
understand the word we first use, we must find some other
of the same meaning --if he does not know what the
15 word pain means, we must try the word dolor, or some
other; but if he have never felt pain, the most ingenious
description of it would be utterly useless.
But there are abstract notions that are complex, or made
up of two or more ideas, and may therefore be described
20 by mentioning those constituent ideas. Thus, in the instances already mentioned, justice may be described as the
paying a strict regard to the rights and interests of othors;
or, the not preferring our own welfare to that of others.
Generosity is the conferring of benefits upon others be25 yond what they would claim. Form or figure is the relation to each other of the several surfaces of a solid body.
Distance is extension between two points, divided into
parts, and numbered. Place is the relation between ono
point and some other points on a surface. Perfection is
30 the existence, together, of all the parts or properties that
are assigned to some complex body or being.
Design is the relation of all the parts of a complex body
to the last effect which it is intended to produce. Truth
is the relation of sameness between things and our notions

tween cause and effect. In all such instances there is a
notion conveyed by the word we employ which admits of
40 being resolved into two or more ideas.
Now it is peculiarly important to understand the difference between simple and complex abstract notions; because,
on the one hand, much time is often wasted in the vain
attenpt to describe or analyze what is simple; and, on tha
386
[lgX.  c1RHIEtETORICAL, READING.
otler hand, much confusion often arises from neglecting to
analy ze notions that are complex: hence it is that so many
words are used in argumnent to which the disputants attach
different ideas, and therefore are never able to come to an
5 agreement, even when they are really of the same opinion.
It is a good exercise to define or analyze complex abstract
notions.
The faculty of abstraction, conjoined with the use of
language, is that chiefly which distinguishes human nature,
10 and raises man far above all other animals.
After having thought of certain qualities apart from the
things in which they are found, the human mind takles
another step, and proceeds to bring together such qualities
and compose them in niew forms:--this is invention.
15 The same faculty enables man to think of the quality, or
goodness or badness of actions, and is therefore essential
to accountableness, and forms the basis of our moral
nature.
Those differences of intellectual character and taste
20 which distinguish mankind individually depend very much
upon the faculty of abstraction.  One man possesses
eminently the power of separating color from form; and
he becomes a painter: another, in connection with sensibility and delicacy of taste, readily separates or draws off
25 those qualities of things which excite the imagination; and
he becomes a poet: another discerns and separates the
mechanical properties of matter; and he is an inventor of
machines: another discriminates mathematical properties;
and he addicts himself to abstract science.
30    Each department of science, and each wallc of active
life, has its peculiar kind of abstraction; nor can a man be
very successful in any line, if nature has denied him the
special factulty which is demanded in that line.
What is called a natural taste for particular pursuits is
35 most commonly a peculiar power of considerin(g some one
class of qualities apart from all other qualities or circumstances. It is well when the choice of a profession is
made in conformity with the original conformation of the
mind.--Taylor's Elements of Thou-ght.

Aqueozs Agencies.
25   AquEous agents, or those arising from the power and
force of water, are perhaps not so universal nor so complex
in their operations as atmospheric; but they are more
powerful, and consequently exert a more obvious influence
in modifying the crust of the globe. Their mode of action
30 is either mechanical or chemical; -mechanical, as when a
river wears away its banks, and carries the material to
the sea; and chemical, when from gaseous admixture
water is enabled to dissolve certain rocks and metals.
The action of water is sometimes slow and gradual, as
35 in the wearing down of rocks'by rain; or rapid and violent,
388
[Ex. CllI.as in the case of river-floods and sea-storms. The effects
of rain upon a cliff may not amount to one inch in a hundred years, while hundreds of acres of alluvial land may
be swept to the ocean by one river-flood.
5   Water operates variously:- sometimes by itself, as in
rivers; sometimes in union with the atmosphere, as during
land and sea storms. Its power as a geological agent is most
obvious in the case of rains, springs, rivers, lakes, waves,
currents and tides; and the results of these agents are dis10 tinguished as meteoric, fluviatile, lacustrine, or oceanic.
Rain, hail, snow, and all atmospheric vapors, exercise a
degrading influence on the earth's surface. By entering
the pores and fissures of rocks, they soften and gradually
dissolve their surface, and thus materially assist the opera15 tions of frosts, winds, &amp;c. Rain, accompanied by high
winds, acts with greater force; snow, from accumulating
during frost, and suddenly dissolving during fresh weather,
sometimes occasions violent floods and inundations. Floods
arising from the melting of snow are generally very de20 structive, for, during the season when they occur, the surface is soft and loose, and much mrore liable to be carried
away.
Rain and other vapors are indispensable to the growth
of vegetables, and, when accompanied with sufficient
25 warmth, a luxuriant and gigantic vegetation, like that of
the tropics, is the result. The amount of rain which falls
on the earth's surface is exceedingly varied, ranging from
twenty or thirty inches to several feet per annum. In
tropical regions, rains are periodical; that is, fall for weeks
30 together at certain seasons. This gives rise to inundations; hence the peculiar phenomena attending the floodings of such rivers as the Nile, Ganges, &amp;c.
Of the quantity of rain which fell during past periods
of the world we have no positive knowledge; but if we are
35 able to discover evidence of a higher temperature, we are
warranted in concluding that the quantity of rain was
much greater.
A greater fall of rain would produce larger rivers, and
larger rivers would carry down a greater quantity of silt
40 and debris; this would form more extensive plains and
deltas; and these, again, would sustain a more gigantic
race of plants and animals. From this example, the student will readily perceive the connection and influence of
these allied causes. Rain-water generally contains car33*

Springs are discharges of water from the crust of the
earth, either by rents, fissures, or other openings in the
5 surface. The water which falls in rain, snow, &amp;c., partly
runs off, and partly sinks into the crust, where it collects
in vast quantities, and ultimately finds its way again to
the surface by springs.
Springs issuing from strata at great depths are said to
10 be deep-seated; those from clay or gravel are shallow.
Some only flow during, or shortly after, rains, and are said
to be temporary; some flow always, and are perennial;
while others flow and ebb, and are said to be intermittent.
15   The characters in which geologists have principally to
consider springs are cold, thermal, and mineral. Cold
springs have a mechanical action when they cut out channels for themselves; and they act chemically when, for
example, they contain carbonic acid, and dissolve portions
20 of the rocks through which they pass.
All petrifying springs -that is, such as convert wood
and bones into stony matter--act chemically. Thermal
or hot springs occur in numerous parts of the world, (England, Iceland, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Hlindostan,
25 &amp;c.,) and also act mechanically and chemically, but with
much greater chemical force than cold springs. Min_eal
springs may be either cold or hot, and take their name
from the circumstance of their waters holding some mineral
or earthy substance in solution.
30   Mineral springs, geologically speaking, are by far the
most important, as, from their composition, they indicate
the kind of rocks through which they pass, while they
more or less influence all deposits or waters into which
they flow. Thus, some contain iron, and are said to be
35 ferruginous, or chalybeate; some copper, (cupriferous,)
some lime, (calcareous,) some salt, (saline,) while others
give off sulphureous vapors; and so on with almost every
known mineral.
Those issuing from strata containing iron or lime are
40 more or less impregnated with these substances; and when
they arrive at the surface of the earth, and their waters
become exposed to the air, the ferruginous or limy matter
is deposited along their courses, or is carried down to- the
nearest river or lake.
390
PtARKER'S EXERCISES IN
[EX. CII.If layers of mud, sand or gravel, be forming in such a
lake, these layers will be impregnated w-ith the matter of
the springs; hence geologists speak of ferruginous, calcareous, or saliferous strata. Mineral springs may therefore
5 be saidl to exert a two-fold influence:-- first, by dissolving
and carrying away matter from the strata beneath; and,
second, by adding that matter to the strata which are now
being formed on the surface.
The student will thus perceive the manner in which
10 springs act in modifying the crust of the earth; and in
proportion to their size, the softness of the strata through
which they passed, and the degree of heat they had
acquired, so must the extent of their influence have been
at any former period.
15   Rivers are the most important aqueous agents employed
in modifying the surface of the globe. Springs, as they
issue into open day, naturally seek a lower level; and
numbers of them, meeting in one channel, form streams,
which again join in some still lower valley, where their
20 union produces rivers of various sizes. 2Rivers may be
said to be a species of natural drainings, by which the
superabundant moisture which falls on the land is again
returned to the sea. They are of all dimensions:- in
breadth from a few feet to several miles; so shallow that a
25 boy might wade them, or so deep as to float the largest
ships;' and ranging in length of course from fifty or sixty
miles to as many hundreds.
The geological action of rivers is two-fold: -first, by
wearing down the land through which they pass, and then
30 by carrying down the material to lakes and seas. Both
their degrading and transporting force depends upon their
velocity. For example, it has been calculated that a force of
three inches per second will tear up fine clay, six inches will
lift fine sand, eight inches sand as coarse as linseed, and
35 twelve fine gravel; while it requires a velocity of twentyfour inches per second to roll along rounded pebbles an
inch in diameter, and thirty-six inches per second to sweep
angular stones of the size of a hen's egg.
Rivers, during floods, often acquire a much greater
40 velocity than this, and stones of considerable weight are
borne down by their currents. The degrading power of
running water depends also upon the' kind of material
through which it flows; loose soil, clay, and sandstone
being easily worn down, while granite or basalt will suffer
45 little loss for centuries.
EX. CIII.3
391
RHETORICAL READING.PARKER'S EXERCISES IN
The mere flowing of pure water would exert little influ:
ence on hard rocks; but all rivers carry down sand and
gravel; and these, by rubbing and striking against the
sides and bottoms of the channel, assist in scooping out
5 those channels which everywhere present themselves.
The Nerbuddah, a river of India, has scooped out a clnannel in basaltic rock one hundred feet deep.
Messrs. Sedgwick and Murchison give an account of
gorges scooped out in beds of the rock called conglomerate,
10 in the valleys of the Eastern Alps, six or seven hundred
feet deep. A stream of lava, which was vomited from
I/Etna in 1603, happened to flow across the channel of
the river.Sirneto.  Since that time the stream has cut a
passage through the compact rock to the depth of between
15 forty and fifty feet, and to the' breadth of between fifty and
several hundred feet.
The cataract of Niagara, in North America, has receded
nearly fifty yards during the last forty years. Below the
falls, the river flows in a channel upwards of one hundred
20 and fifty feet deep and one hundred and sixty yards wide,
for a distance of seven miles; and this channel has evidently been produced by the action of the river. Such
effects as the above are produced by the general or ordinary
action of water; but when rivers are swollen by heavy
25 rains, by the sudden melting of snow, and the like, then
they act with extraordinary violence.
In these cases they overflow their banks, rush with a
velocity of twenty or thirty feet per second, tear up the soil,
and sweep before them trees, animals, houses, and bridges.
30 The water of all rivers which exert a degrading influence
is more or less turbid, and an idea of their power may be
formed by observing this fact.
The matter which rivers carry down is either deposited
along their banks, in lakes, or in the ocean. If they flow
35 sluggishly along a flat valley, the mud and sand which
their waters contain gradually falls to the bottom, and there
rest as sediment. This sedimentary matter forms what is
called alluvial land, and most of the flat and fertile valleys
in the world have been so produced.
40   Again, when a lake occurs in the course of rivers, the
sediment is there collected, and the water issues from the
lake as if it had been filtered. In progress of time, lakes
are filled or sifted up with this sediment, and theirsbasins
appear first as marshes, and latterly as alluvial land.
392
[EX. CIILBut whatever quantity of matter may be deposited in
valleys or lakes, the greatest amount will always be carried
down to the ocean, and deposited at the mouth of the river,
or along the shores. The heaviest material, such as
5 gravel, will fall down first, then the lighter sand, and ultimately the finest mud. The mud of the Ganges discolors
the Bay of Bengal to a distance of sixty miles from its
mouth; and, according to Captain Sabine, the muddy
waters of the Amazon may be distinguished three hundred
10 miles from the shore.
The consequence of this continual seaward carriage of
sedimentary matter is, that at the mouths of most rivers
there are alluvial formations known by the name of deltas;
such as those of the Nile, the Ganges, the Niger, &amp;c.
15 They take their name from their resemblance in shape to
the Greek letter A (delta;) and frequently extend over
vast surfaces - that of the Ganges being about two hundred miles in one direction, by two hundred and twenty
in another. They consist of alternate layers of sand,
20 gravel, or mud, according to the kind of material the river
carries down.
The geological results effected by the agency of running
water are ceaseless and universal. Rivers are gradually
wearing down the hills and higher lands, and as gradually
25 silting up lakes and low tracks of valley land. They lay
down beds of gravel, sand, or mud; and these beds, again,
inclose trees, plants, and the bones and shells of animals,
in greater or less abundance.
As rivers now act, so must they have always acted, and
30 to this kind of agency must we ascribe the formation of
many of the rocks (with their fossils) which now form the
crust of the earth, both at great depths and at distances
now far removed from the sea. We have no actual
knowledge of the rivers of the ancient world; but judging
35 from the extent of sedimnentary rocks, they must have been
much more gigantic lhan most of those now existing.
Waves, currents, and tides are also powerful geologica.
agents. Waves are continually in action; and according
to their violence, and the materials composing the sea-coast,
40 so is the amount of change produced. Cliffs of sandstone,
chalk, clay, or other soft rock, are, year after year, undermined by their force; masses fall down, are soon ground
to pieces, and swept off by every tide; new underrnimings
take place; new masses fall, down, and thus thousands of
45 acres of land have been reduced to a level with the sea.

EX. CIII.
RIETORIC.L READING.9  PARKER'S EXERCISES IN
What the waves batter down, the tides and currents
transport to sheltered bays and creeks along the shore; so
that, while in one quarter the sea is making encroachments
on the land, in another it is accurnulating sand and gravel
5 to form new land.
The power of waves and currents is much increased by
the fact that rocks are more easily moved in water, and
thus gravel beaches are piled up or swept away with apparent facility. The ordinary action is small, however, com10 pared with what is sometimes accomplished during storms
and high inundations; and those who have witnessed the
effects of a few successive tides at such periods will readily
form an estimate of what may be accomplished during the
lapse of ages.
15   The action of waves, currents and tides, is varied and
complicated; but it may be stated generally, that waves
batter down the sea-cliffs, or raise up loose matter from the
bottom; that tidal currents convey the disintegrated matter
to more sheltered bays and creeks; and that oceanic cur20 rents convey floating material, such as drift-wood, plants,
and dead animals, from one part of the ocean to another.
Tides rise and ebb from four to forty feet; they enter into
certain rivers for many miles, and thus a mingling of fresh
water and marine deposits takes place. As at present, so
25 in ages past; and by diligently studying the effects produced:by waves and tides, the s-tudent will be enabled to
account for many apppearances which the sedimentary
rocks present.- David Page.

EXERCISE CVII.
On the Power of Custom, and the Uses to which it may be
applied.
THERE is not a common saying which has a better turn
15 of sense in it than what we often hear in the mouths of
the vulgar, that "Custom is a second nature." It is, indeed, able to form the man anew, and give him inclinations
and capacities altogether different from those he was born
with.
20   A person who is addicted to play or gaming, though he
took but little delight in it at first, by degrees contracts so
strong an inclination towards it, and gives himself up so
entirely to it, that it seems the only end of his being.
The love of a retired or busy life will grow upon a man
25 insensibly, as he is conversant in the one or the other, till
he is utterly unqualified for relishing that to which he has
been for some time disused.
Nay, a man may smoke, or drink, or take snuff, till he
is unable to pass away his time without it, not to mention
30 how our delight in any particular study, art, or science;
rises and improves in proportion to the application which
we bestow upon it. Thus, what was at first an exercise
becomes at length an entertainment. Our employments
are changed into diversions. The mind grows fond of
35 those actions it is accustomed to; and is drawn with reluctancy from those paths in which it has been used to
walk.
398
[EX. CVILIf we attentively consider this proptrty of human nature, it may instruct us in very fine moralities. In the
first place, I would have no man discouraged with that
kind of life, or series of action, in which the choice'of
5 others, or his own necessities, may have engaged him. It
may perhaps be very disagreeable to him, at first;'but use
and applicationi will certainly render it not only less painful, but pleasing and satisfactory.
In the second place, I would recoramend to every one
10 the admnirable precept which Pythagoras is said to have
given to his disciples, and which that philosopher must
have drawn from the observation 1 have enlarged upon:
"Pitch upon that course of life which is the most excellent, and custom will render it the most delightful."
15   Men whose circumstances will permit them to choose
their own way of life are inexcusable if they do not pursue that which their judgment tells them is the most laudable. The voice of reason is more to be regarded than
the bent of any present inclination; since, by the rule
20 above mentioned, inclination will at length come over to
reason, though we can never force reason to comply with
inclination.
In the third place, this observation may teach the most
sensual and irreligious man to overlook those hardships
25 and difficulties which are apt to discourage him from the
prosecution of a virtuous life. "The gods," said Hlesiod,
"have placed labor before virtue; the way to her is at
first rough and difficult, but grows more smooth and easy
the. further we advance in it."  The man who proceeds
30 in it with steadiness and resolution will, in a little time,
find that "her ways are ways of'pleasantness, and that
all her paths are peace."
To enforce this consideration, we may further observe,
that the practice of religion will not only be attended with
35 that pleasure which naturally accompanies those actions
to which we are habituated, but with those supernumerary
joys of heart that rise from the consciousness of such a
pleasure; from the satisfaction of acting up to the dictates of reason, and from the prospect of a happy immor40 tality.
In the fourth place, we may learn from this observation
which we have made on the mind'of man to take particular care, when we are once settled in a regular course of
life, how we too frequently indulge ourselves in even the

who furnished it were so unaccountable; his person was so

to be an angel, sent by Heaven for their preservation.

EXAMPLES.
174. Let your dress be sober, clean, and modest; not to
set off the beauty of your person, but to declare the sobriety
of your mind; that your outward garb may resemble the inward plainness and simplicity of your heart.
175. In meat and drink, observe the rules of Christian
temperance and sobriety; consider your body only as the
servant and minister of your soul; and only so nourish it,
as it may best perform an humble and obedient service.
176. Condescend to all the weakness and infirmities of
your fellow-creatures; cover their frailties; love their excellences; encourage their virtues; relieve their wants; rejoice
in their prosperity; compassionate their distress; receive their
friendship; overlook their unkindness; forgive their malice;
be a servant of servants; and condescend to do the lowest
offiees for the lowest of mankind.
AAmost innocent diversions and entertainments; since the
mind may insensibly fall off from the relish of virtuous
actions, and by degrees exchange that pleasure which it
takes in the performance of its duty for delights of a
5 much inferior and an unprofitable nature.
The last use which I shall make of this remarkable
property in human nature, of being delighted with those
actions to which it is accustomed, is, to show how absolutely necessary it is for us to gain habits of virtue in this
10- life, if we would enjoy the pleasures of the next. The
state of bliss we call heaven will not be capable of affecting those minds which'are not thus qualified for it; we
must, in this world, gain a relish for truth and virtue, if
we would be able to taste that knowledge and perfection
15 which are to make us happy in the next.
The seeds of those spiritual joys and raptures which
are to rise up and flourish in the soul to all eternity must
be planted in it during this its present state of probation.
In short, heaven is not to be looked upon only as the ro
20 ward, but as the natural effect, of a religious life.

The Contrast.
As rueful stood his other half, as wan
Of cheek: small her ambition was - but strange.
The distaff, needle, all domestic cares,
Religion, children, husband, home, were things
25  She could not bear the thought of; bitter drugs
That sickened her soul. The house of wanton mirth
And revelry, the mask, the dance, she loved,
And in their service soul and body spent
Most cheerfully; a little admiration,
30  Or true, or false, no matter which, pleased her,
And o'er the wreck of fortune lost, and health,
And peace, and an eternity of bliss
Lost, made her sweetly smile. She was convinced
That God had made her greatly out of taste,

EXERCISE CIX.
How to Remember what we Read.
MOST readers, I presume, will open this chapter with no
25 little curiosity, and a feeling which would be expressed by
these words: "IMy memory is bad enough--would it
were as good as that of such a one of my friends! Let me
see if there be any rules to suit so bad a case as mine."
Now, before you decide that you have a worse memory
30 than your friend, let me ask,--is there no one subject on
which you can equal him? You have no doubt observed
that a large class of men who are devoted exclusively and
literally to animal pursuits - sportsmen, to wit - have the
greatest difficulty in remembering matters of history or
35 general literature, but yet are so ready with the names of
all the winners of the Derby, Oaks, or St. Leger, and the
progeny and pedigree of each;, that a scholar would be as
403
EX. CM.]
RHETORICAL READING.,PARKER'S EXERCISES IN
much surprised at their memory of horses and mares, as
they could be at the scholar's memory of kings and queens.
Probably you will now say, "( All this we grant; it is
true we have memory for some things but not for litera5 ture.", Your meaning is, that you have memory where
you have attention. The sportsman cannot attend to books,
nor the scholar to horses. The art of memory is the art
of attention. A memory for literature will increase with
that interest in literature by which attention is increased.
10   The sportsman could remember pages of history relating
to forest laws, or encouragement of the breed of horses,
but not the adjoining pages on the law of succession; and
only because he felt an interest, and consequently paid attention, in reading the one, but not the other.
15   Again, memory depends on association, or the tendency
of some things to suggest or make us think of others.
The geologist remembers fossils, but not flowers; and the
botanist flowers, but not fossils. Each has in his mind a
"cell" for the one specimen, but not for the other; and
20 the observations which fall in with the ideas of the geologist, and link to many a subtle chain of thought, remain
alone and unassociated in the mind of the botanist. Association certainly is, in some respects, an aid to attention;
they are usually considered as distinct, and the basis of
25 memory; therefore every rule I can give for promoting
either attention or association will be virtually rules for
memory.
Memory is assisted by whatever tends to a full view and
clear apprehension of a subject. Therefore, in reading
30 history, occasionally lay the book aside and try if you can
give a connected narrative of events. "What thou dost
not know, thou canst not tell," but clear ideas never want
plain words. Do not be satisfied with feeling that the
subject is too familiar for repetition to be necessary. The
35 better a story is known, the less time it will take to repeat.
Put your "thoughts in express words." - This is an
invaluable exercise; for, first of all, you will greatly improve your power of expression, and gain that command
of language on which one of my friends heard Fox com40 pliment Pitt, as having not only a word, but the word, the
very word, to express his meaning.
Secondly, the practice of putting your thoughts into
words will improve your power of conception. When you
see a speaker, in a long argument. contract and fix his eye
404
[EX CIXas if on some aerial form, he is trying to body forth his
ideas and hold them up as a picture, from which he may
select, read off, and lay before his hearers, such portions as
he thinks will convey the desired impression.
5   Conception is the quality for which we call a man " clear.
headed; " for this enables him to grasp at one view the
beginning, middle, and end of what he means to say, and
have the order of his ideas at the direction of a cool judgment, instead of depending upon chance. To repeat a
10 narrative to another is better still than repeating it to yourself; you are more excited to accuracy, and your memory
is assisted by the degree of attention and association which
casual remarks and questions may promote.
With a view to distinct conception, writing is usually
15 recommended to aid memory. As to mere transcribing,
though much has been advanced in its favor, I believe it is
by no means to be adopted. 1Much experience has shown
me that it not only wastes time, but deceives us as to the
extent.of our knowledge. We are flattered at the sight
20 of the paper we fill, while in reality we are exercising not
our wits but our fingers.
Every university student knows how common it is to
find men of misguided industry, with desks full and heads
empty. Writing never aids memory but when it tends
25 to clear conception. Most persons find it more pleasant
to draw a sketch of a subject on a sheet of paper than on
the tablets of the mind, but let them not suppose it is more
improving.
When you want relief or variety, you may try to write,
30 instead of repeating, the subject of your morning's reading;
but you will soon admit that the viva voce exercise is the
better of the two. In speaking of conception, Abercrombie
relates the case of a distinguished actor, who created great
surprise by learning a long part with very short notice.
35 " When questioned respecting the mental process which he
employed, he said that he lost sight entirely of the audience, and seemed to have nothing before him but the pages
of the book from which he had learned; and that if anything had occurred to interrupt that illusion, he should have
40 stopped instantly."
Secondly. Memory is assisted by whatever adds to our
interest or entertainment. - Therefore, all the remarks I
have made relative to being guided by curiosity and incliEX. CIX.]
RIIETORICAL READING.
405nation are hints for memory. A man rarely forgets a fact
which he hears in answer to a question he has himself
originated; and the art of reading is to gain facts in such
order that each shall be a nucleus or basis, as Abercrombie
5 says, of more; in other words, that every fact may be an
answer to some question already in our minds, and suggest
in its turn a new question in an endless series.
Thirdly. Memory depends much on a thorough determination to remember. - Most persons have memory
10 enough for the purposes of their own business. Ask the
guard of the mail how he remembers the places at which
he has to drop his many parcels, and he will tell you, " because he must." And if you put the same question to
any number of different persons whose fortune depends on
15 the constant exercise of memory, you will invariably receive
similar answers, which is a proof from experience that our
memory depends very much on our own will and determination. If, by the force of resolution, a person can wake at
any hour in the morning, it is easy to believe that, by the
20 same means, he may also have a powerful command over
his memory.
While at the university, I had a very remarkable proof
of this. I was assisting in his studies, previous to examination, a friend, who assured me he could not remember
25 what he read; that such had been the case during fourteen
university terms. But I said, -" Now you must remember, -I know you can, - anl I will have no more to do
with you if you do not answer me correctly to-morrow on
what we read to-day." Having rallied him in this way, I
30 heard no more of the complaint. After his examination,
he assured me that he was perfectly surprised at the extent
to which his memory had served him, and fairly acknowledged that for years he had given way to a state of mental
inactivity, never stopping to try his me'mory, but thinking
35 of the Castalian stream rather after the manner of Baron
Munchausen's horse when he had lost his hinder quarters
with the portcullis.
A man can remember, to a great extent, just as Johnson
said a man might at any time compose, mastering his hu40 mor, if he will only set to work with a dogged determination. "That they can conquer who believe they can,"
is very generally true where the mind is concerned. A
very common reason that men do not- remember is, that
they do not try;'a hearty and ever-present desire to pre.
vail is the chief element of all success.

PARKER )S EXERCISES~ IN
[EX. CId.Nothing but the fairy's wand can realize the capricious
desire of the moment; but as to the objects of laudable
wishes, deeply breathed, and for many a night and dav
ever present to the mind,- these are placed by Providence
5 more within our reach than is commonly believed. When
a person says, "If I could only have my wish, I would
excel in such an art or science," we may generally answer,"The truth is, you have no such wish; all you covet is
the empty applause, not the substantial accomplishment."
10 The fault is 1" in ourselves, and not our stars," if we are
slaves, and blindly yield to the pretensions of the many
whose tongues would exhaust wiser heads than their own
in half an hour
Before we complain of want of power and mental
15 weapons, let us be sure that we make filll use of what we
have. When we see one man write without hands, and
another qualify himself (as in an instance within my own
remembrance) for high university honors without eyes, a
complaint of our memory, or other faculties, justifies the
20 same. conclusion as when workmen complain of their tools.
These, or at least other instances equally surprising, are
founded on good authority. Still, Abercrombie justly says,
that though the power of remembering unconnected facts
and lists of words makes a great show, and is the kind of
25 memory most generally admired, still it is often combined
with very little judgment, and is not so important a feature
in a cultivated mind as that memory founded on the relations, analogies, and natural connections of different subjects, which is more in our power.
30   Indeed, mere parrot memory is of less use than is generally supposed. It is true, it enables a superficial person
to pass off the opinions of others as his own; but educated
men can generally remember enough for their own purposes,
and can command data sufficient for the operations of their
35 judgmnent. What we most want ready and available is the
power and the science, not the tools. A mathematician is
such still, without his formulae and diagrams. The oldest
judge renlembers the rules of law, though he forgets the
case in point, and the ablest counsel are allowed refreshers.
40 Surely it is enough that our minds, like our guns, carry
true to the mark, without being always loaded.
Fourthly. Memory is assisted by whatever tends to
connection or association of ideas. - When I asked the
friend above mentioned the particular means he t6ok to
remember his lectures previous to examination, he said,
EX. cIX.]
407
RHETORICAL READING.PARKER'S EXERCISES IN
that besides loolking everything "more fully in the face"
than he had ever done before, he tried "to match, sort, and
put along-side of something similar," each event in its
5 turn, and also to say to himself, - "Here are four or five
causes, circumstances, or characters, relating to the same
thing; by such a peculiarity in the first I shall remember
the second, while something else in the second will remind
me of the third and fourth."
10   During this process, he said he became so familiar with
many facts, that he could remember without any association at all. Again; in all the works and phenomena of
nature, moral or physical, men of comprehensive minds
discern a marked family likeness; certain facts indicate the
15 existence of others; so that memory is assisted by a cer.
tain key which classification suggests; and thus one efforf
of memory serves for all.- Pycroft's Course of Reading,

Happiness equally distributed.
As some lone miser, visiting his store,
Bends at his treasure, counts, recounts it o'er,
20  Hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill,
Yet still he sighs, for hoards are wanting still:
Thus to my breast alternate passions rise,
Pleased with each good that Heaven to man supplies;
Yet oft a sigh prevails, and sorrows fall,
25  To see the hoard of human bliss so small;
And oft I wish amid the scene to find
Some spot to real happiness consigned,
Where my worn soul, each wandering hope at rest,
May gather bliss to see my fellows blessed.
30     But where to find that happiest spot below,
Who can direct, when all pretend to know?
The shuddering tenant of the frigid zone
Boldly proclaims that happiest spot his own;
Extols the treasures of his stormy seas,
35  And his long nights of revelry and ease.
The naked negro, panting at the line,
Boasts of his golden sands and palmy wine,
Basks in the glare, or stems the tepid wave,
And thanks his gods for all the good they gave.

His first, best country, ever is at home.
And yet, perhaps, if countries we compare,
And estimate the blessings which they share,

An equal portion dealt to all mankind:
As different good, by art or nature given
To different nations, makes their blessings even.
Nature, a mother kind alike to all,
10  Still grants her bliss at labor's earnest call;
With food as well the peasant is supplied
On Idra's cliffs as Arno's shelvy side;
And though the rocky-crested summits frown,
These rocks, by custom, turn to beds of down.
15    Thus every good his native wilds impart
Imprints the patriot passion on his heart;
And even those hills that round his mansion rise
Enhance the bliss his scanty fiund supplies.
Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms,
20  And dear that hill wi ich lifts him to the storms;
And as a child, when scaring sounds molest,
Clings close and closer to the mother's breast,
So the loud torrent and the whirlwind's roar,
But bind him to his native mountains more.

30   But though not polished, there was no embarrassment
or rusticity in his address, which, where it served his purpose, could be plausible, and even insinuating. The proof

ostentatious dress, wghich he regarded as an encumbrance.
The costume which he most affected on public occasions
was a black cloak, with a white hat, and shoes of the
same color; the last, it is said, being in imitation of the
5 Great Captain, whose character he had early learned to
admire in italy, but to which his own, certainly, bore very
faint resemblance.
He mwas temperate in eating, drank sparingly, and
usually rose an hour before dawn. He was punctual in
10 attendance to business, and shrunk from no toil. He had,
indeed, great powers of patient endurance. Like most of
his nation, he was fond of play, and cared little for the
quality of those with whom he played; though, when his
antagonist could not afford to lose, he would allow him15 self, it is said, to be the loser; a mode of conferring an
obli,ga-tion much commended by a Castilian writer, for its
delicacy.
Though avaricious, it was in order to spend, and not to
hoard. His ample treasures, more ample than those, prob20 ably,.that ever before fell to the lot of an adventurer, were
mostly dissipated in his enterprises, his architectural works,
and schemes of public improvement, which, in a country
where gold and silver might be said to have lost their
value from their abundance, absorbed an incredible amount
25 of money.
While he regrarded the whole country, in a manner, as
his own, and distributed it freely among his captains, it is
certain that the princely grant of a territory with twenty
thousand vassals, made to him by the crown, was never
30 carried into effect; nor did his heirs ever reap the benefit
of it.
To a man possessed of the active energies of Pizarro,
sloth was the greatest evil. The excitement of play
was in a manner necessary to a spirit accustomed to the
35 habitulal stimulants of war and adventure. His uneducated mind had no relish for more refined, intellectual
recreation. The deserted foundling had neither been
taught to read nor write. This has been disputed by some,
but it is so attested by unexceptionable authorities.
40   Montesinos says, indeed, that Pizarro, on his first voyage, tried to learn to read; but the impatience of his
temper prevented it, and he contented himself with learning to sign his name. But Montesinos was not a contemporary historian. Pedro Pizarro, his companion in arms,
4101
[Et. c'}expressly tells us he could neither read nor write; and
Zarate, another contemporary, well acquainted with the
conqueror, confirms this statement; and adds, that Pizarro
could not so much as sign his name. This was done by
5  his secretary--Picado in his latter years--while the
governor merely made the customary ri&amp;brica, or flourish
at the sides of his name.
This is the case with the instruments I have examined,
in which his signature, written probably by his secretary,
10 or his title of Marques, in later life substituted for his
name, is garnished with a flourish at the ends, executed
in as bungling a manner as if done by the hand of a
plowman.    Yet we must not estimate this deficiency as
we should in this period of general illumination,- gen15 eral, at least, in our own fortunate country.
Reading and writin,g, so universal now, in the beginning
of the sixteenth century might be regarded in the light
of accoirplishments; and all who have occasion to consult
the autograph memorials of that time will find the execution
20 of them, even by persons of the highest rank, too often such
as would do little credit to a school-boy of the present day.
Though bold in action, and not easily turned from his
purpose, Pizarro was slow in arriving at a decision. This
gave him an appearance of irresolution foreign to his
25 character. Perhaps the consciousness of this led him to
adopt the custom of saying " No," at first, to applicants for
favor; and afterwards, at leisure, to revise his judgment,
and grant what seemed to him expedient.
He took the opposite course from his comrade, Almagro,
30 who, it was observed, generally said'" Yes," but too often
failed to lkeep his promise. This was characteristic of the
careless and easy nature of the latter, governed by impulse
rather than principle.
It is hardly necessary to speak of the courage of a man
35 pledged to such a career as that of Pizarro. Courage,
indeed, was a cheap quality among the Spanish adventurers, for danger was their element. But he possessed
something higher than mere animal courage, in that constancy of purpose which was rooted too deeply in his na40 ture to be shalen by the wildest storms of fortune.
It was this inflexible constancy which formed the key
to his character, and constituted the secret of his success.
A remarkable evidence of it was given in his first expedition, among the mangroves and dreary marshes of Choco.

not yield, nor did he falter in his enterprise.
5   There is something oppressive to the imagination in
this war against nature. In the, struggle of man against
man, the spirits are raised by a contest conducted on equal
terms; but in a war with the elements, we feel that, however bravely we may contend, we can have no power to
10 control. Nor are we cheered on by the prospect of glory
in such a contest; for, in the capricious estimate of human
glory, the silent endurance of privations, however painful,
is little, in comparison with the ostentatious trophies of
victory. The laurel of the hero -alas for humanity that
15 it should be so! -grows best on the battle-field.
This inflexible spirit of Pizarro was shown still more
strongly, when, in the little island of Gallo, he drew
the line -on the sand which was to separate him and
his handful of followers from their country and from civ20 ilized man. He trusted that his own constancy would
give strength to the feeble, and rally brave hearts around
him for the prosecution of his enterprise. He looked with
confidence to the future, and he did not miscalculate.
This was heroic, and wanted only a nobler motive for its
25 object to constitute the true moral sublime.
Yet the same feature in his character was displayed in
a manner scarcely less remarkable, when, landing on the
coast and ascertaining the real strength and civilization of
the Incas, he persisted in marching into the interior at the
30 head of a force of less than two hundred men. In this he
undoubtedly proposed to himself the example of Cortez, so
contagious to the adventurous spirits of that day, and
especially to Pizarro, engaged, as he was, in a similar
enterprise.
35   Yet, the hazard assumed by Pizarro was far greater
than that of the conqueror of Mexico, whose force was
nearly three times as large, while the terrors of the Inca
name - however justified by the result - were as widely
spread as those of the Aztecs.
40   It was doubtless in imitation of the same captivating
model that Pizarro planned the seizure of Atahuallpa.
But the situations of the two Spanish captains were as
dissimilar as the manner in which their acts of violence
were conducted. The wanton massacre of the Peruvians
412
[EX. CXI.RHETORICAL READING.
resembled that perpetrated by Alvarado in Mexico, and
might have been attended with consequences as disastrous,
if the Peruvian character had been as fierce as that of the
Aztecs. But the blow which roused the latter to madness
5 broke the tamer spirits of the Peruvians. It was a bold
stroke, which left so much to chance that it scarcely merits
the name of policy.
When Pizarro landed in the country he found it dis.
tracted by a contest for the crown. It would seem to have
10 been for his interest to play off one party against the other,
throwing his own weight into the scale that suited him.
Instead of this, he resorted to an act of audacious violence
which crushed them both at a blow.
His subsequent career afforded no scope for the profound
15 policy displayed by Cortez, when he gathered conflicting
nations under his banner, and directed them against a
common foe. Still less did he have the opportunity of
displaying the tactics and admirable strategy of his rival.
Cortez conducted his military operations on the scientific
20 principles of a great captain at the head of a powerful host.
Pizarro appears only as an adventurer, - a fortunate
knight-errant.
By one bold stroke he broke the spell which had so long
held the land under the dominion of the Incas. The spell
25 was broken, and the airy fabric of their empire, built on
the superstition of ages, vanished at a touch. This was
good fortune, rather than the result of policy.
Pizarro was eminently perfidious. Yet nothing is more
opposed to sound policy. One act of perfidy, fully estab30 lished, becomes the ruin of its author. The man who relinquishes confidence in his good faith gives up the best
basis for future operations. Who will knowingly build on
a quicksand? By his perfidious treatment of Almagro,
Pizarro alienated the minds of the Spaniards. By his
35 perfidious treatment of Atahuallpa, and subsequently of
the Inca Manco, he disgusted the Peruvians.
The name of Pizarro became a by-word for perfidy.
Almagro took his revenge in a civil war; Manco, in an in.
surrection which nearly cost Pizarro his dominion. The
40 civil war terminated in a conspiracy which cost him his
life. Such were the fruits of his policy. Pizarro may be
regarded as a cunning man; but not, as he has been often
eulogized by his countrymen, as a politic one.
When Pizarro obtained possession of Cuzco, he found a

country well advanced in the arts of civilization; instit,.
tions under which the people lived in tranquillity and personal safety; the mountains and the uplands whitened
with flocks; the valleys teeming with the fruits of a sci5 entific husbandry; the granaries and warehouses filled to
overflowing; the whole land rejoicing in its abundance;
and the character of the nation, softened under the influence of the mildest and most innocent form of superstition.
well prepared for the reception of a higher and a Christian
10 civilization.
But far from introducing this, Pizarro delivered up the
conquered races to his brutal soldiery; the sacred cloisters
were abandoned to their lust; the towns and villages were
given up to pillage; the wretched natives were parcelled
15 out like slaves, to toil for their conquerors in the mines;
the flocks were scattered, and wantonly destroyed; the
granaries wei'e dissipated; the beautiful contrivances for
the mor6 perfect culture of the soil were suffered to fall
into decay; the paradise was converted into a desert.
20   Instead of profiting by the ancient forms of civilization,
Pizarro preferred to efface every vestige of them from the
land, and on their ruin to erect the institutions of his own
country. Yet these institutions did little for the poor
Indian, held in iron bondage. It was little to him that the
25 shores of the Pacific were studded with rising communities
and cities, the marts of a flourishing commerce. He had
no share in the goodly heritage. He was an alien in the
land of his fathers.
The religion of the Peruvian, which directed him to
30 the worship of that glorious luminary which is the best
representative of the might and beneficence of the Creator,
is perhaps the purest form of superstition that has existed
among men. Yet it was much, that, under the new order
of things, and through the benevolent zeal of the mission35 aries, some glimmerings of a nobler faith were permitted
to dawn on his darkened soul.
Pizarro himself cannot be charged with manifesting any
overweening solicitude for the propagation of the Faith.
He was no bigot, like Cortez. Bigotry is the perversion
40 of the religious principle; but the principle itself was
wanting in Pizarro. The conversion of the heathen was a
predominant motive with Cortez in his expedition. It was
not a vain boast. He would have sacrificed his life for it
at any time; and more than once, by his indiscreet zeal,
414
LEX. CXI.he actually did place his life and the success of his enterprise in jeopardy.
It was his great purpose to purify the land from the
brutish abominations of the Aztecs, by substituting the reli5 gion of Jesus. This gave to his expedition the character
of a crusade. It furnished the best apology for the conquest, and does more than all other considerations towards
enlistino  our sympathies on the side of the conquerors.
But Pizarro's ruling motives, so far as they can be
10 scanned by human judgment, were avarice and ambition.
The good missionaries, indeed, followed in his train to
scatter the seeds of spiritual truth, and the Spanish government, as usual, directed its beneficent legislation to the
conversion of their natives.
15   But the moving power with Pizarro and his followers
was the lust of gokl. This was the real stimulus to their
toil, - the price of' perfidy, --the true guerdon of their
victories.  This gave a base aind mercenary character to
their enterprise; and when we contrast the ferocious
20 cupidity of the conquerors with the mild and inoffensive
manners of the conquered, our sympathies, the sympathies
even of the Spaniard, are necessarilv thrown into the
scale of the Indian.
But as no picture is without its lights, we must not, in
25 justice to Pizarro, dwell exclusively on the darker features
of his portrait.  There was no one of her sons to whom
Spain was under larger obligations for extent of empire;
for his hand won for her the richest of the Indian jewels
that once sparlded in her imperial diadem.
30    When we conteimiplate the perils he braved, the sufferings he patiently endured, the incredible obstacles he overcatne, the mag,ificent resuits he effected with his single
arim, as it were, unaided by the government, - though
neither a good. nor a great man, in the highest sense of
35 the term, --it is impossible not to regard him as a very
extraordinary one.
Nor can we fairly omit to notice, in extenuation of his
errors, the circumstances of his early life; for, like Almagro, he was the soIn of sin and sorrow, early cast upon the
40 world to seek his fortunes as he might. In his you n and
tender age he was to take the impression of those into
whose society he was thrown. And when was it the lot
of the needy outcast to fall into that of the wise and the

Who does not shudder at the thought of what his own

amount of crime does not necessarily show the criminality
of the agent. History, indeed, is concerned with the

EXERCISE CXIII.
Extract fromn the Preface of a Work entitled " The Wisdom and Genius of Shakspeare."
T'HE lucid pages of Shakspeare have been justly characterized " the richest, the purest, the fairest, which genius
uninspired ever laid open." His morals are numerous and
of an exalted character; and more moral knowledge is
5  contained in,a few lines, or a sentence of our author, than
is to be found in a whole chapter of those works which
treat expressly of moral science.  There is one thing
worthy of special observation in his morals, which presents
his character in a very interesting light; I refer to the
10 strong tincture which they have of divine truth, affording
evidence of his mind having been deeply imbued with the
pure morality of the Gospel.
This highly interesting feature of his morals I have
pointed out in many instances, by references to particular
15 passages of scripture.  Although the first part of the
work is designated Moral Philosophy, the reader must not
infer from thence that there are no morals in the other
sections: the truth is, morals pervade the whole work, but
many of them are so interwoven with the characters, nature,
20 and the passions, &amp;c., as not to admit of being separated.
Our author's paintings of the passions are not less
deserving of our admiiiration than his moral wisdom and
delineations of character. He is the great master of the
human heart, and depicts in an inimitable manner all the
25 feelings of humanity, from the almost imperceptible emotions to the most tempestuous passions that agitate the
breast of man. As Schlegel justly observes, " he lays open
to us in a single word a whole series of preceding conditions."
30   In that part of the work which respects Nature, I have
exhibited to the reader those exquisitely beautiful natural
images which abound throughout our author's writings,
and which claim the admiration of every cultivated mind.
This excellence has been often alluded to, and is thus
35 beautifully expressed by one who was capable of appreciating it" He was familiar with all beautiful forms and images,
with all that is sweet or majestic in the simple aspects of
nature, - of that indestructible love of flowers and odors,
40 and dews and clear waters, and soft airs and sounds, and
418
EX. CXIII.bright sAies and woodland solitudes, and moonlight bowers,
which are the material elements of poetry,- and with
that fine sense of their undefinable relation to mental'
emotion which is its essence and vivifying soul, and which,
5 in the midst of his most busy and atrocious scenes, falls
like gleams of sunshine on rocks and ruins, contrastingc
with all that is, rugged and repulsive, and reminding us of
the existence of purer and brighter elements."
Take also the sentiments of the following writers who
10 speak in accordance with this work:-" To instruct by
delighting is a power seldom enjoyed by man, and still
seldomer exercised. It is in this respect that Homer may
be called the second of men, and Shakspeare the first.
The wisdom of the Greek was not so universal as that of
15 the Briton, nor his genius so omnipotent in setting it forth
attractively. From the several works of the latter, a single
work might be compiled little less worthy of divine sanction
than any other extant, and by the beauty of its nature far
more secure of human attention.
20   ".But Shakspeare has done so much in this way- so
nearly all that is sufficient, - he has made the laws of the
decalogue, and all their corollaries, so familiar,- he has
exhibited the passions and propensities, the feelings and
emotions, incident to humanity, so freely, and, as we might
25 say, graphically, that another such artist would be superfluous. Nature might create a second Shakspeare, but it
would be bad economy. What the first has left undone,
may be completed by a much less expense of Promrethean
fire than would go to the creation of a second.
30   " We are therefore not to look for a similar being, at least
until we acquire new attributes, or are under a new moral
dispensation.  Spirits of an inferior order, -a Milton, a
Pope, or a Cowper, -are potent enough to disseminate
the remaining or minor truths of natural morality amongst
35 the people; or rather, to repeat, illustrate, and impress
them on our hearts and memories.
" Writers of this class, whom we may call the lay-ministers of the deity, to teach from the press instead of the
pulpit, in the closet instead of the church, we may
40 expect; and with them should be satisfied.,Though we
cannot reasonably hope for another high prophet of profane
inspiration to recommunicate to us the lessons of divine
wisdom which are already to be found in Shakspeare, it is
no presumption to hope that the spirit of illumination will

along with the flesh.

night which his rider cannot perceive; but when it is too
dark for his sight, his sense of smelling is his guide.
190. In summer, horses in the country feed on grass, or on
grass and oats; in winter, they eat oats, corn, and hay. When
grazing in the pasture, they always choose the shortest grass,
because it is the sweetest; and as they have cutting teeth in
both their jaws, they can eat very near the ground.

descend upon humbler poets, and make them our secular
guides in morality."
The same sentiments, with respect to Shakspeare's writings, are thus expressed by another author: --' It is quite
5 impossible to estimate the benefit which this country has
received from the eternal productions of Shakspeare.
Their influence has been gradual, but prodigious, - operating at first on the loftier intellects, but becoming in time
diffused over all, spreading wisdom and charity amongst
10 us. There is, perhaps, no one person of any considerable
rate of mind who does not owe something to this matchless
poet.
"He is the teacher of all good,- pity, generosity, true
courage, love. His works alone (leaving mere science out
15 of the question) contain, probably, more actual wisdom than
the whole body of English learning. He is the text for
the moralist and the philosopher. His bright wit is cut
out' into little stars;' his solid masses of knowledge are
meted out in morsels and proverbs; and thus distributed,.
20 there is scarcely a corner which he does not illuminate, or
a cottage which he does not enrich. His bounty is like the
sea, which, though often unacknowledged, is everywhere
felt -on mountains and plains, and distant places, carrying its cloudy freshness through the air, making glorious
25 the heavens, and spreading verdure on the earth beneath."
It is with infinite satisfaction that I%am borne out in my
opinion of the nature of this work by a similar remark of
Coleridge. "I greatly dislike beauties and selections in
general; but as proof positive of his unrivalled excellence,
30 I should like to try Shakspeare by this criterion. Malke
out your amplest catalogue of all the -human faculties, as
reason, or the moral law, the will, the feeling of the coincidence of the two called the conscience, the understanding, or prudence, wit, fancy, imagination, judgment,
35 --and then of the objects on which these are to be employed, as the beauties, the terrors, and the seeming caprices, of nature, the realities and the capabilities--that is,
the actual and the ideal --of the human mind, conceived
as an individual or as a social being, as in innocence or in
40 guilt, in a play-paradise or in a war-field of temptation, -
and then compare with Shakspeare, under each of these
heads, all or any of the writers in prose and verse that
have ever lived. Who that is competent to judge doubts
the result? "- Rev. Thomas Price.

Dominie Sampson's Encounter with Meg illerrilies.
UPON the next day at breakfast, however, the Dominie
did not mnake his appearance. He had walked out, a servant said, early in the morning. It was so common for
iaim to forget his meals that his absence never deranged
35 the family. The housekeeper, a decent old-fashioned Presbyterian matron, having, as such, the highest respect for
Sampson's theological acquisitions, had it in charge upon
these occasions to take care that he was no sufferer by his
PARKER 9S EXERCISES IN~
422
[Ex. Cr.absence of mind, and therefore usually waylaid him upon
his return, to remind him of his sublunary wants, and to
minister for their relief. It seldom, however, happened
that he was absent from two meals together, as was the
5 case in the present instance. We must explain the cause
of this unusual occurrence.
The conversation which Mr. Pleydell had held with
Mannering upon the subject of the loss of Harry Bertram
had awakened all the painful sensations which that event
10 had inflicted upon Sampson. The affectionate heart of the
poor dominie had always reproached him, that his negligence in leaving the child in the care of Frank Kennedy
had been the proximate cause of the murder of the one,
the loss of the other, the death of Mrs. Bertram, and the
15 ruin of the family of his patron. It was a subject which
he never spoke upon, if indeed his mode of conversation
could be called speaking at any time; but which was often
present to his imagination.
The sort of hope so strongly affirmed and asserted in
20 Mrs. Bertram's last settlement had excited a corresponding
feeling in the dominie's bosom, which was exasperated into
a sort of sickening anxiety by the discredit with which
Pleydell had treated it. "Assuredly," thought Sampson
to himself, "he is a man of erudition, and well skilled in
25 the weighty matters of the law; but he is also a man of
humorous levity and inconstancy of speech; and wherefore
should he pronounce ex cathedra, as it were, on the hope
expressed by worthy Madam Margaret Bertram of Singleside?"
30   All this, I say, the dominie thought to himself; for had
he uttered half the sentence his jaws would have ached
for a month under the unusual fatigue of such a continued
exertion. The result of these cogitations was a resolution
to go and visit the scene of the tragedy at Warroch Point,
35 where he had not been for many years --not, indeed,
since the fatal accident had happened. The walk was a
long one, for the Point of Warroch lay on the further side
of the Ellangowan property, which was interposed between
it and Woodbourne. Besides, the dominie went astray
40 more than once, and met with brooks swollen into torrents
by the melting of the snow, where he, honest man, had
only the summer recollection of little trickling rills.
At length, however, he reached the woods which he bad
made the object of his walk and traversed them with care,
Ex. cXV.1
423
RHETORICAL READING.muddling his disturbed brains with vague efforts to recall
every circumstance of the catastrophe. It will readily be
supposed that the influence of local situation and association was inadequate to produce conclusions different from
5 those which he had formed under the immediate pressure
of the occurrences themselves. With "many a weary
sigh, therefore, and many a groan," the poor dominie returned from his hopeless pilgrimage, and wearily plodded
his- way towards Woodbourne, debating at times in his
10 altered mind a question which was forced upon him by
the cravings of an appetite rather of the keenest, namely,
whether he had breakfasted that morning or no.
It was in this twilight humor, now thinking of the
loss of the child, then involuntarily compelled to meditate
15 upon the somewhat incongruous subject of hung-beef, rolls
and butter, - that his route, which was different from that
which he had taken in the morning, conducted him past
the small ruined tower, or rather vestige of a tower, called
by the country people the Kaim of Derncleugh.
20   The reader may recollect the description of this ruin as
the vault in which young Bertram, under the auspices of
Meg Merrilies, witnessed the death of HIatteraick's lieutenant. The tradition of the country added ghostly terrors to the natural awe inspired by the situation of this
25 place, which terrors the gypsies who so long inhabited the
vicinity had probably invented, or at least propagated, for
their own advantage.
The lights, often seen around the tower when used as
the rendezvous of the lawless characters by whom it was
30 occasionally frequented, were accounted for, under authority of these tales of witchery, in a manner at once con
venient for the private parties concerned, and satisfactory
to the public.
Now it must be confessed that our friend Sampson,
35 although a profound scholar and mathematician, had not
traveled so far in philosophy as to doubt the reality of
witchcraft or apparitions. Born indeed at a time when a
doubt in the existence of witches was interpreted to be a
justification of their infernal practices, a belief of such
40 legends had been impressed upon him as an article indivisible from his religious faith, and perhaps it would have
been equally difficult to have induced him to doubt the
one as the other. With these feelings, and in a thick

misty day, which was already drawing to its close, Dominie Sampson did not pass the Kaim of Derncleugh without
some feelings of tacit horror.
What, then, Was his astonishment when, on passing the

there by one of the latter lairds of -Ellangowan to prevent
presumptuous strangers from incurring the dangers of the
haunted vault --that very door supposed to be always
locked, and the key of which was popularly said to be
10 deposited with the presbytery--that very door opened
suddenly,. and the figure of Meg Merrilies, well known,
though not seen for many a revolving year, was placed at
once before the eyes of the startled dominie.
She stood immediately before him in the foot-path, con15 fronting him so absolutely that he could not avoid her
except by fairly turning back, which his manhood prevented him from thinking of. "I kenned ye'wad be here,"
she said, with her harsh and hollow voice, "I ken wha
ye seek; but ye maun do my bidding."
20   "Get thee behind me!" said the alarmed dominie -
"Avoid ye!- Conjuro te, scelestissimna --nequissima--
spurcissima- iniquissima - atque miserrima - conjuro
te:! _!! " Meg stood her ground against this tremendous volley of superlatives, which Sampson hawked up
25 from the pit of his stomach, and hurled at her in thunder.
"Is the carl daft," she said, "wi' his glamor?"
"Cognjuro," continued the dominie, "adjuro, contestor,
atque viriliter impero tibi.!  " "What, in the name
of Sathan, are ye feared for, wi' your French gibberish,
30 that would make a dog sick? Listen, ye stickit stibler, to
what I tell ye, or ye sall rue it whiles there's a limb o' ye

looked at them before; will ye mind a' this?'"
"Assuredly," said the dominie, "I am dubious -for,.36*

to heal thee."   They'll do you nae ill, though, and
maybe inuckle gude." --"Avoid ye! I desire nae good
that comes by unlawfu' means."
5   " Fule-body that thou art! " said Meg, stepping up to
him with a frown of indignation that made her dark eyes
flash like lamps from under her bent brows -" Fule-body!
if I meant ye wrang, could na I clod ye ower that craig,
and wad man ken how ye cain by your end mair than
10 Frank Kennedy? Hear ye that, ye worricow?"
"In the name of all that is good," said the dominie, recoiling and pointing his long pewter-headed walking-cane
like a javelin at the supposed sorceress, " in the name of
all that is good, bide off hands! I will not be handled -
15 woman, stand off upon thine own proper peril! - desisi, I
say - I am strong - lo, I will resist! " Here his speech
was cut short, for Meg, armed with supernatural strength,
(as the dominie asserted,) brolce in upon his guard, put by
a thrust which he made at her with his cane, and lifted
20 him into the vault, 1" as easilv," said he, " as I could sway
a Kitchen's atlas."
" Sit doun there," she said, pushing the half-throttled
preacher with some violence against a broken chair, " sit
doun there, and gather your wind and your senses, ye
25 -black barrow-tram o' the kirk that ye are - are ye fou or
fasting?  
"Fasting from all but sin," answered the dominie, who,
recovering his voice, and finding his exorcisms only served
to exaJperate the intractable sorceress, thought it best to'0 affect complaisance and submission, inwardly conning over,
however, the wholesomne conjurations which he durst no
longer utter aloud. But as the dominie's brain was by no
means equal to carry on two trains of ideas at the same
time, a word or two of his mental exercise sometimes es35 caped, and mingled with his uttered speech in a manner
ludicrous enough, especially as the poor man shrunk himself together after every escape of the kind, from terror of
the effect it might produce upon the irritable feelings of
the witch.
40   Meg, in the mean while, went to a great black cauldron
that was boiling on a fire on the' floor, and lifting the lid,
an odor was diffused through the vault, which, if the vapors
of a witch's cauldron could in aught be trusted, promised
better things than the hell-broth which such vessels are

usually supposed to contain. It was in fact the savor of a
goodly stew, composed of fowls, hares, partridges, and
moor-game, boiled in a large mess with potatoes, onions
and leelcs, and, from the size of the cauldron, appeared to
5 be prepared for half a dozen of people at least. "So ve
hae eat naething a' day?" said Meg, heaving a large portion of this mess into a brown dish, and strewing it savorily with salt and pepper.
" Naething, answered the dominie, -- scelestissima!10 that is, gudewife." - " Hae, then," said she, placing the dish
before him; " there's what will warm your heart."--" I
do not hunger -  rnalefica - that is to say, Mrs. Merrilies;"
for he said unto himself, " the savor is sweet, but it hath
been cooked by a Canidia or an Ericthoe."
15   "If ye dinna eat instantly, and put some saul in ye, by the
bread and the salt, I'll'put it doun your throat wi' the cutty
spoon, scauding as it is, and whether ye will or no. Gape,
sinner, and swallow!"  Sampson, afraid of eye of newt,
and toe of frog, tiger's chaudrons, and so forth, had deter.
20 mined not to venture; but the smell of the stew was fast
melting his obstinacy, which flowed fromn his chops as it
were in streams of water, and tlle witch's threats *decided
him to feed. Hunger and fear are excellent casuists.
"Saul," said Hunger, "' feasted with the witch of Endor."
25 I"And," quoth Fear, "the salt which she sprinkled upon
the food showeth plainly it is not a necromantic banquet,
in wnich that seasoning never occurs."-" And besides,"
says Hunger, after the first spoonful, "it is savory and
refreshingr viands."'
30    "So ye like the meat?" said the hostess.--" Yea,"
answered the dominie, "and I give thee thanlks - sceleratissimra! - which means Mrs. Margaret." -" Aweel, eat
your fill; but an ye kenn'd how it was gotten, ye maybe
wadna like it sae weel." - Sampson's spoon dropped, in the
3b act of conveying its load to his mouth. -" There'e been
mony a moonlight watch to bring a' that trade thegither;
the folk that are to eat that dinner thought little c' your
gamre-laws."
"Is that all?" thought Sampson, resuming his spoon,
40 and shoveling away manfully; "I will not lack my food
upon that argument." -s"  Now  ye maun tak a dram."
" I will," quoth Sampson -" conjuro te - that is, I thank
you heartily; " for, he thought to himself, in for a penny
in for a pound, and he fairly drank the witch's health in a

cupful of brandy. When he had put this cope-stone upon
Meg's good cheer, he felt, as he said, " mightily elevated,
and afraid of no evil which could befall unto him."
" Will ye remember my errand now? " said Meg Mlerri.
5 lies; " I ken by the cast o' your e'e that ye're anither man
than when you cam in." -" I will, Mrs. Margaret," repeated Sampson, stoutly; "I will deliver unto him the
sealed yepistle, and will add what you please to send by
word of mouth."
10   "Then I'll make itlshort," says Meg. "Tell him to
look at the stars without fail this night, and to do what I
desire him in that letter, as he would wish
That Bertram's right and Bertram's might

16 I have seen him twice when he saw na me; I ken when
he was in this country first, and I ken what's brought him
back again. Up, and to the gate! ye're ower lang here;
follow me."
Sanmpson followed the sybil accordingly, who guided him
20 about a quarter of a mile through the woods, by a shorter
cut -than he could have found for himself; they then entered upon the common, Meg still marching before him at
a great pace, until she gained the top of a small hillock
which overhung the road.
25   "1 Here," she said, "stand still here. Look how the setting sun breaks through yon cloud that's been darkening
the lift a' day. See where the first stream o' light fa's;
it's upon Donagild's round tower--the auldest tower in
the castle of Ellangowan, -that's no for naething. See
80 as it's glooming to seaward abune yon sloop in the bay,that's no for naething neither.
"Here I stood, on this very spot," said she, drawing
herself up so as not to lose one hair-breadth of her uncommon height, and stretching out her long sinewy arm and
35 clenched hand -" here I stood, when I tauld the last Laird
of Ellangowan what was coming on his house; and did
that fa' to the ground? - na! it hit even ower sair! And
here, where I brake the wand of peace ower him- here I

And now, Abel Sampson, as ever ye lo'ed the house of

as if life and death were upon your haste! "
So saying, she turned suddenly from the amazed domi5 nie, and regained with swift and long strides the shelter.
of the wood from which she had issued at the point where
it most encroached upon the common. Sampson gazed
after her for a moment in utter astonishment, and then
obeyed her directions, hurrying to Woodbourne at a pace
10 very unusual for him, exclaiming three times, " Prodigious!
prodigious! pro-di-gi-ous!"
As Mr. Sampson crossed the hall with a bewildered
look, the good housekeeper, who was on the watch for his
return, sallied forth upon him:--"What's this o't now,
15 Mr. Sampson? - this is waur than ever; ye'1 really do
yoursell some injury wi' these lang fasts, - naething sae
hurtful to the stomach, Mr. Sampson. If you would but
put some peppermint draps in your pocket, or let Barnes cut
you a sandwich."
20   "Avoid thee!" quoth the dominie, his mind running
still upQon his interview with Meg Merrilies, and making
for the dining-parlor. -" Na, ye need na gang in there;
the cloth's been removed an hour ago, and the colonel's at
his wine; but just step into my room; I have a nice steak
25 that the cook will do in a moment." -" Exorciso te " said
Sampson, -" that is, I have dined."
" Dined! it's impossible! Wha can ye hae dined wi',
you that gangs out nae gate? "--" With Beelzebub, I believe," said the minister. -" Na, then he's bewitched for
30 certain," said the housekeeper, letting go her hold; " he's
bewitched or he's daft, and ony way the colonel maun
just guide him his ain gate. Waes me! Hech, sirs! It's
a sair thing to see learning bring folk to this! " and with
this compassionate ejaculation, she retreated into her own
35 premises.
The object of her commiseration had by this time entered the dining-parlor, where his appearance gave great
surprise. He was mud up to the shoulders, and the natural
paleness of his hue was twice as cadaverous as usual,
40 through terror, fatigue, and perturbation of mind. " What
on earth is the meaning of this, Mr. Sampson?" said
Mannering, who observed Miss Bertram  looked much
alarmed for her simple but attached friend.

Sampson1  was about to reply; but finding his Latin
5 formula of exorcism still came most readily to his tongue,
he prudently desisted from the attempt, and put the scrap
of paper which he had received from the gypsy into Mannering's hand, who brole the seal and read it with surprise.
" This seems to be some jest," he said, "and a very dull
10 one."
"6 It came from no jesting person," said Mr. Sampson. -
"From whom, then, did it come? " - The dominie, who
often displayed some delicacy of recollection in cases where
Miss Bertram had an interest, recollected the painful cir15 cumstances connected with Meg Merrilies, looked at the
young ladies, and remained silent. " We will join you at
the tea-table in an instant, Julia; I see that Mr. Sampson
wishes to speak to me alone. - And now they are gone,
what, in Heaven's name, is the meaning of this?"
20   "It may be a message from heaven," said the dominie,
"but it came by Beelzebub's postmistress. It was that
witch, Meg Merrilies, who should have been burned with
a tar-barrel twenty years since, for a harlot, thief, witch,
and gypsy."--" Are you sure it was she?" said the colonel,
25 with great interest. -" Sure, honored sir? the like o' Meg
MIerrilies is not to be seen in any land."
The colonel] paced the room rapidly, cogitating with
himself. " To send out to apprehend her--but it is too
distant to send to MacMorlan, and Sir Robert H-azlewood

"'Many of her class set out by being impostors; and

cheating themselves or when imposing on others.- Well,
my course is a plain one, at any rate; and if my efforts are
fiuitless, it shall not be owing to over-jealousy of my own

ordering Barnes into his private sitting-room, gave him
some orders, with the result of which the reader may be
made hereafter acquainted. - Sir Walter Scott.

LESSON XIV.
THE COLON.
The Colon consists of two periods placed one above the other,
thus:
Sometimes the passage ending with e colon is to be read
with the voice suspended; but it should generally be read
with the falling inflection of the voice. In this lesson the
falling inflection is r equired.
Be carefuZ to let this pause be a TOTAL CESSATION OF THE
VOIcE, - longer than that indicated by a comma, or by a semicolon.
EXAMPLES.
210. The smile of gayety is often assumed while the heart
aches within: though folly may laugh, guilt will sting.
211. There is no mortal truly wise and restless at the same
time: wisdom is the repose of the mind.
212. Nature felt her inability to extricate herself from the
consequences of guilt: the gospel reveals the plan of Divine
interposition and aid.
213. Nature confessed some atonement to be necessary:
the gospel discovers that the atonement is made.
214. Law and order are forgotten: violence and rapine
are abroad: the golden cords of society are loosed.
215. The temples are profaned: the soldier's curse resounds in the house of God: the marble pavement is trampled by iron hoofs: horses neigh beside the altar.
216. Blue wreaths of smoke ascend through the trees,
and betray the half-hidden cottage: the eye contemplates
well-thatched ricks, and barns bursting with plenty: the
peasant laughs at the approach of winter.
217. The necessaries of life are few, and industry secures
them to every man: it is the elegancies of life that empty the
44purse the knick-knacks of fashion, the gratification of pride,
and the indulgence of luxury, make a man poor.
218. Your tree was as fruitful, and in as good order as
his: it bore as many blossoms, and grew in the same soil:
only it was not fostered with the same care. Edmund has
kept his tree clear of hurtful insects: you have suffered them
to eat up yours in its blossom.
219. My dear children, I give you these trees: you see
that they are in good condition. They will thrive as much
by your care as they will decline by your negligence: their
fruits will reward you in proportion to your labor.
220. But Abraharn pressed him greatly: so he turned, and
thev went into the tent: and Abraham baked unleavened
bread, and they did eat.
221. A bee among the flowers in spring is one of the
most cheerful objects that can belooked upon. Its life appears to be all enjoyment: so busy and so pleased: yet it is
only a specimen of insect life, with which, by reason of the
animal being half domesticated, we happen to be better acquainted.
222.'Tis a picture in memory distinctly defined, with
the strong and unperishing colors of mind: a part of my
being beyond my control, beheld on that cloud, and transcribed on my soul.
223. Bare trees and shrubs but ill you know could shelter
them from rain or snow: stepping into their nests they paddled: themselves were chilled, their eggs were addled: soon
every father bird and mother grew quarrelsome and pecked
each other.
224. Yet such is the destiny of all on earth: so flourishes and fades majestic man.
225. Let those deplore their doom  whose hopes still
grovel in this dark sojourn: but lofty souls, who look beyond the tomb, can smile at fate, and wonder why they
mourn.
226. If for my faded brow thy hand prepare some future wreath, let me the gift resign: transfer the rosy garland: let it bloom around the temples of that friend beloved, on whosp maternal bosom, even now, I lay my aching
head.
227. We do not understand these things: we are told
that your religion was given to your forefathers, and has
been handed down fronm father to son. We also have a
religion which was given to our fo.refathers, and has been

handed down to us: it teaches us to be thankful for al
favors received, to love each other, and to be united- we
never quarrel about religion.
LESSON XV.
T H E C 0 L O N,- continued.
In this lesson the passages ending with a colon are to
be read wzith the voice suspencled. (See Lesson 9th.)
228. Do not flatter yourselves with the hope of perfect
happiness: there is no such thing in the world.
229. He was often heard to say: I have done with the
world; and I am willing to leave it.
229. Be not a niggard of your speech: how goes it?
229. Those will be bad days to acquire and cultivate the
spirit of devotion: but the spirit of devotion, acquired, and
cultivated, and confirmed before, will convert those bad days
into good ones.
230. But, when old age has on your temples shed her
silver frost, there's no returning sun: swift flies our summer,
swift our autumn's fled, when youth, and spring, and golden
joys, are gone.
231. A divine legislator, uttering his voice from heaven;
an almighty governor, stretching forth his arm to punish or
reward; informing us of perpetual rest prepared hereafter
for the righteous, and of indignation and wrath awaiting the
wicked: these are the considerations which overawe the
world, which support integrity, and check guilt.
232. Not to the rosy maid, whom former hours beheld
Ine fondly covet, tune I now the melancholy lyre: but'tis
to thee, O Sickness!'tis to thee I wake the silent strings.
233.* A boy at school is by no means at liberty to read
what books he pleases: he must give attention to those
which contain his lessons; so that when he is called upon
to recite, he may be ready, fluent, and accurate in repeating
the portion assigned him.
233. A poet is by no means at liberty to invent what
system of the marvelous he pleases: he must avail himself
-  See note on page 33.
46either of the religious faith, or the superstitious credulity
of the country wherein he lives; so as to give an air of
probability to events which are most contrary to the common course of nature.
234.* It is not only in the school-room, that attention
should be given to your books: there is a place, one not
like a scbool-room; I mean your own chamber: where you
can find many opportunities of acquiring knowledge.
234. It is not only in the sacred fane that homage should
be paid to the Most High: there is a temple, one not made.
with hands; the vaulted firmament: far in the woods, almost
beyond the sound of city-chime, at intervals heard through
the breezeless air.
235. As we perceive the shadow to have moved along
the dial, but did not perceive its moving; and it appears
that the grass has grown, though nobody ever saw it grow;
so the advances we make in knowledge, as they consist of
such minute steps, are perceivable only by the distance
gone over.
236. When the proud steed shall know why man restrains
his fiery course, or drives him o'er the plains; when the dull
ox, why now he breaks the clod, is now a victim, and now
Egypt's god: then shall man's pride and dulness comprehend his actions', passions', being's use and end.
237. Jehovah, God of hosts, hath sworn, saying: Surely
as I have devised, so shall it be; and as I have purposed,
so shall it stand.
238. That day he wore a riding coat, but not a whit the
warmer he: another was on Thursday brought, and ere the
Sabbath he had three.
239. George, you must not laugh at me; I will not bear
it. You forget what you are about when you ridiculle me.
I know more than you do about the lessons.
239. Brutus, bay not me; I'll not endure it. You fot.
get yourself, to hedge me in: I am a soldier, older in practice, abler than yourself to make conditions
240. I never heard a word about it before, said George,
yesterday: who told you about it, Charlest?

Toby, hastily: how came he there, Trin?

LESSON XVI.
THE PARENTHESIS, CROTCHETS, AND
BRAC KETS
A Parenthesis is a sentence, or part of a sentence, inclosed between two curved lines like these ( )
The curved lines in which t/he parenthesis is inclosed are
called Crotchets.
The parenthesis, with the crotchets wvhich inclose it, is
generally inserted between the words of another sentence,
and nmay be omitted without injuring the sense.
The parenthesis should generally be read in a quicker and
lower tone of voice than the other parts of the sentence in
ushich it stands.
Sometimes a sentence is inclosed in marks like these [ ]
which are called Brackets.*
Sentences which are included within crotchets or brackets,
should generally be read in a quicker and lower tone of voice
EXAMPLES.
242. I asked my eldest son (a boy who never was guilty
of a falsehood) to give me a correct account of the matter.
243. The master told me that the lesson (which was a
very difficult one) was recited correctly by every pupil in
the class.
244. When they were both turned of forty, (an age in
which, according to Mr. Cowley, there is no dallying with
life,) they determined to retire, and pass the remainder of
their days in the country.
245. Notwithstanding    all this care of Cicero, history
informs us, that Marcus proved a mere blockhead; and
that nature (who, it seems, was even with the son for her
* Although the crotchet and the bracket are sometimes indiscriminately
used, the following difference in their use may generally be noticed: Crotchets
are used to inclose a sentence, or part of a sentence, which is inserted between
thze parts of another sentence: brackets are generally used to separate two
subjects, or to inclose an explanation, noet, or observation, standing by itself.
When a parenthesis occurs withill another parenthesis, brackets inclose the
former, and crotchets inclose the latter. See No. 263.

48prodigality to the father) rendered him incapable of improving, by all the rules of eloquence, the precepts of philosophy, his own endeavors, and the most refined conversation in Athens.
246. Natural historians observe (for whilst I am in the
country I must fetch my allusions from thence) that only
the male birds have voices; that their songs begin a little
before breeding-time, and end a little after.
247. Dr. Clark has observed, that Homer is more perspicuous than any other author; but if he is so, (which yet
may be questioned,) the perspicuity arises from his subject,
and not from the language itself in which he writes.
248. The many letters which come to me from persons
of the best sense of both sexes (for I may pronounce their
characters from their way of writing) do not a little encourage me in the prosecution of this my undertaking.
249. It is this sense which furnishes the imagination with
its ideas; so that by the pleasures of the imagination, or
fancy, (terms which I shall use promiscuously,) I here mean
such as arise from visible objects.
250. The stomach (cramnm'd from every dish, a tomb of
boiled and roast, and flesli and fish, where bile, and wind,
and phlegm, and acid, jar, and all the man is one intestine
war) remembers oft the school-boy's simple fare, the temperate sleeps, and spirits light as air.
251. William  Penn was distinguished from  his companlions by wearing a blue sash of silk network, (which it
seems is still preserved by Mr. Kett of Seething-hall, near
Norwich,) and by having in his hand a roll of parchment,
on which was engrossed the confirmation of the treaty of
purchase and asmity.
252. Again, would your worship 4 moment suppose, ('tis
a case that has happened, and may be again,) that the visage
or countenance had not a nose, pray who would, or who
could, wear spectacles then?
25'3. Upon this the dial-plate (if we may credit the fable)
changed countenance with alarm.
254. To speakl of nothinog else, the arrival of the English in.her father's dominions must have appeared (as indeed
it turned out to be) a most portentous phenomenon.
255. Surely, in this age of invention something may be
struck out to obviate the necessity (if such necessity exists)
of so tasking the human intellect.

IN READI~'G.PREFACE.
THE principal difficulty, in teaching the art of- Reading, lies in con veyir:g
to the pupil a clear idea of tone, modulation, and inflection of the voice. It
the teacher can induce the pupil to inflect his voice at all, he will find little
difficulty in teaching him to modulate it rightly.  Nature directs every one
in this, in common conversation, with unerring precision. It is only, there
fore, by " holding the mirror up to Nature," that the teacher cal expect to see
her as she is. Few teachers have not noticed the animation and correctness
with which even young children will modulate the colloquial parts of their
story-books. But the same children alhnost invariably fall into a lifeless,
monotonous manner, when performing their portioned tasks in their readingbooks at school. This arises from no watlt of excellent selections for exercises in Reading. But a wide distinction is to be drawn between a lesson
and an exe}rcise. We have many selections aboundillg in all the beauties of
taste, learning, aind judgment; which may, with great advantage, be put
into the hands of the pupil, after he has beepn taucght the art of reading; but
I have met with none, designed for the general classes of learners, which
have combined instruction with practice. It has been thought that directions
for the management of the voice in reading would be lost upon young learners, and that they are suitable for them only whose riper powers and moorw
matured intellect better fit them for their reception. But it seems to have
been forgotten, hovw easily children are taught to imitate. If, in connection
with some colloquial sentence, another of less obvious import be given,
q'equiring the sanze modulations and inflections of the voice, the child naturally catches the true manner of modulating the latter, from the former. It is
upon this principle of imitation and analogy combined, that many of the
lessons in this volume are founded.'rhe author has been convinced, by
experience, in the institution under his charge, that the principle is a good
one; and experience, he thinks, does not often deceive. Whether the details
-f the plan are judiciously executed, is for others to decide.
Such being the plan of the work, the author has thought it inexpedient to
encumber its pages with rules, definitions, or explanatory details; because it
has been fully proved that how simple soever a rule may be, the pupil will
not readily apply it, unless particularly directed by the teacher; and if nature
and analogy will direct hiln to a correct and rhetorical modulation, rules and
definitions become superfluolus.
A great deficiency in all our reading-books relnains to be supplied! The

of torture, having in the right land a fresh-nibbed patent
pen, dipped ever and-anon into the ink-bottle, as if to hook
up ideas, and under the outspread palm of the left hand a
fair sheet of best Bath post, (rdady to receive thoughts yet
unhatched,) on which their eyes are rivetted with a stare of
disconsolate perplexity, infinitely touching to a feeling mind.
257. Oh the unspeakable relief (could such a machine
be invented) of having only to grind anl answer to one of
one's dear five hundred frie'nds!
258. Have I not groaned under similar horrors, from the
hour when I was first shut up (under lock and key, I believe)
to indite a dutiful epistle to an honored aunt?
259. To such unhappy persons, then, I would fain offer a
few hints, (the fruit of long experience,) which may prove
serviceable in the hour of emergency.
260. If ever you should come to Modena, (where, among
other relics, you may see Tassoni's bucket,) stop at a palace
near the Reggio gate, dwelt in of old by one of the Donati.
261. My father and my uncle Toby (clever soul) were
sitting by the fire with Dr. Slop; and Corporal Trim (a
brave and honest fellow) was reading a sermon to them. -As
the sermon contains many parentheses, and affords an opportunity also of showing you a sentence in brackets, (you
will observe that all the previous parentheses in this lesson
are enclosed in crotchets,) I shall insert some parts of it in
the following numbers. [See No. 262, 263, &amp;c.]
262. To have the fear of God before our eyes, and in our
mutual dealings with each other, to govern our actions by
the eternal measures of right and wrong: the first of these
will comprehend the duties of religion; the second those of
morality, which are so inseparably connected together, that
you cannot divide these two tables, even in imagination,
(though the attempt is often made in practice,) without
breaking and mutually destroying them  both. [HIere my
father observed that Dr. Slop was fast asleep.] I said the
attempt is often made; and so it is; there being nothing
more common than to see a man who has no sense at all of
religion, and, indeed, has so much honesty as to pretend to
none, who would take it as the bitterest affront, should you
but hint at a suspicion of his moral character, or imagine he
was not conscientiously just and scrupulous to the uttermost
mite.

usually call iii, [There is no need, cried Dr. Slop (waking)
to call in any physician in this case,] to be neither of them
men of much religion.
264. For a general proof of this, examine the history of
the Romish Church: [XTell, what can you make of that?
cried Dr. Slop:] see what scenes of cruelty, murder, rapine,
bloodshed, [Thiey may thank their own obstinacy, cried
Dr. Slop,] have all been sanctified by religion not strictly
governed by morality.
265. Experienced schoolmasters may quickly malie a
grammar of boys' natures, and reduce them    all (saving
some few exceptions) to certain general rules.
266. Ingenious boys, who are idle, think, with the hare
in the fable, that, running with snails, (so they count the
rest of their school-fellows,) they shall come soon enough
to the post; though sleeping a good while before their
starting.
LESSON XVII.
THE DASH.
The Dash is a straight mark like this -
The dash is sometimes used to express a sudden stop, or
change in the subject.
Sometimes the dash requires a pause no longer than e
comma, and sometimes a longer pause than a period.
The dash is frequently used instead of crotchets or brackets,

and other marks used in written language. But ther;e is no elementary
work, designad for common schools, which affords particular exercises for the
mana,gement of those important marks. The author has endeavored, in the
first part of this volume, to supply this remarkable defect; gnd he believes,
that, how much soever others may differ from him in the analogies which he
has traced, in the subsequent lessons, between " the models " and the exercises under the models, he is justly entitled to the credit of having originated
the two important principles above mentioned, upon which the plan of the
work is founded; and he is encouraged. not only by experience, but by the
confident opinion of many judicious Iriends, to whom the plan has been
unfolded, to believe that this volume, assisted by the familiar explanations
of the teacher, will serve as a better introduction to the art of Reading
than a imore labored treatise formed on rhetorical rule. A lesson is first
ctevoted to each of the respective pauses and other marks, and the pupil is
then led by progressive steps, in the subsequent lessons, from the simplest
sentences, requiring little attention to pause, emphasis, or inflection of tha
voice, to those which involve the highest exertions of taste and intellect.

THIE HYPHEN.
The Hyphen is a little mark like this. It resembles a
dash, but is not so long.
The hyphen is used to separate the syll(ables of a word;
or to make one word of two; as, semi-circle, sea-water.
When there is not room enough in the line for the whole
of a word, some of its syllables are put into the line with a
hyphen,  and the remainder in the nzext line: as, extraordinary.
Whlen a hyphen is placed over the letters a, e, i, o, u, or y,
it shows that they have their long sound.
[The pupil may tell for what purpose the hyphen is used
in the following words.]

the dash and ellipsis are both used.

LESSON XX
APOSTROPHE, QUOTATION, AND DISERES[S.
An Apostrolphe is a mark which difersfromn a conzmnacl ony
in being placed above the line; thus n
Thle apostrophe shows that some letter or letters are left
out, as,'tisfor it is, tho' for though, lov'dfor loved.
Thle apostrophe is likewise used in grammar to designate
the possessive case; as, John's book.
A  Quotation consists of four conmmas or apostrophes; tvwo
placed at the begintninig and two at the end of a word, sentence,
or part of a sentence.    The two which are placed at the beginning are inverted, or upside clown.
A  quotation shows that the word or sentence was spoken by
some one, or was taken from    some other author.
A  Diacresis consists of two periods placed over a vowel;
thus, ia.
The diceresis shows that the letter over which it is placed is
to be pronounced separately; as, creitor, Zo6nomia, aerial.
[In this lesson the pupil is to recognize each of the above-mr
tioned marks, and explain their use.]

sentences of poetry, which are nlot divided into poetical lines. The reasoin of
this is, tlhat, in the opinion of the author, poetical lines should not be read by
the pupil, without special instructioin to avoid that "sing song" utterance, into
which he is too apt to fall in reading verse. This subJect is reserved for the
36th lesson, where it is fully exemplified. It remains to be observed here, that
abbreviations and contractions, such as occur in the poetical sentences in this
lesson alsd others, which appear in the, form of prose, are not alloNable in
prose itself. This explanatioii appears to be necessary, lest the authority of
this book should be quoted by the pupil for the use of abbreviations in prose.

LESSON XXII.
ACCENT.
Accent is the peculiar tone orforcedgiven to some letter or
syllable of a word.
Thlere are three accents, the Acute, the Grave, and the
Circumnylex.
The acute accent is noted by a mark like this' placed over
a letter or syllable, as in the word Epicurean.
Thle grave accent is represented by a mark like this'
placed over a letter or syllable, as in the word Clessaimmor.
The circumJlex accent is distinguished by a mark like
this A placed over a letter or syllable.
The letter or syllable over which either of the accents is
placed, is to be pronounced more forcibly than the other parts
of the same word; as, rec'ognize, Reuthamir, Fingal.
The word or syllable over which the acute accent is placed,
must be pronounced with the rising inflection of the voice; as,
rec'ognize, Epicure'an, ac'ceptable.
Tlhe word or syllable over which the grave accent is placed
must be pronlounced with the falling inflection of the voice; as,
Reuthamir, Clessammor.
Thle word or syllable over which the circunmflez accent is
placed, must be pronounced partly with the rising and partly
with thefalling inflection of the voice. If it begin with the ris.
ing and end with the falling, it is called the fialling circumflex;
but if it begin with the falling and end with the rising, it is
called the rising circunflex.
The circumflex accent is sometimes used to exrpress the
broad sound of a letter, as in Fingal, in which the a is
pronounced as in the word fall.
In every word of more than one syllable, there is one (and
somnetimes more than one) which must be pronounced more
forcibly than the others; and the acute accent is oftean uzsed
to show which this syllable is.  The syllable thus pronounced
is called the accented syllable; as, cap'illary, red'olent, ax'iom.
The acute, grave, and circumf-ex accents are sometimes
used to direct the management of the voice in recding sentences: the acute accent indicatbing the rising, the grave the
68fallinlg inflection of the voice, and the circunflez both the
rising atnd falling united.  i7ken the circunflex is used to
indicate a sound commencing with the rising and endilng
with the falling infiection, it is printed thus, ^; but when
the sound commences with the falling and ends with the
rising inflection, it is printed thus, v, which the pupil will
perceive is the same mark inverted.
[The pupil may now read the following sentences, recollecting to manage his voice, when he meets the respective
marks of accent, as directed above.]
405. Did they recite correctly, or incorrectly?
406. They recited correctly, not incorrectly.
407. Did they speak pr6perly, or improperly?
408. They spoke properly, not improperly.
409. Did Charles go willingly, or unwillingly?
410. Charles went willingly, not unwillingly.
411. Did you say Epichirean, or Epicurean?
412. I said Epicurean, not Epicfurean. I know better
than to say so.
413. You must not say accep'table, but ac'ceptable.
414. You must not pronounce that word rec6gnize, but
recognize.
415. We must act according to the law, not contrary to it,
416. Did he say wisdom, or wisdom?
417. He said wisdom, not wisdom.
418. What must the King do n6ow? Must he submit?
The King shall do it: must he be dep6sed?
The King shall be contented: must he lose
The name of King?--let it go!
419. I'll give my jeiwels, for a set of beads;

69INTRODUCTION.
As a large portion of this volume is devoted to a consideration of the
pauses and other marks usually employed in written language, and the
notice which should be taken of them in the correct and judicious enunciation of the sentences in which they are respectively used, a few introCuctory remarks respecting their nature and the origin of their names
may not, perhaps, be deemed superfluous by those who use the book.
Punctuation is peculiar to the modern languages of Europe. It was
wholly unknown to the Greeks and Romans; and the languages of the
East, although they have certain marks or signs to indicate tones, have
no regular system of punctuation. The Romans and the Greeks also,
it is true, had certain points, which, like those of the languages of the
East, were confined to the delivery and pronunciation of words; but the
pauses were indicated by breaking up the matter into lines or paragraphs, not by marks resembling those in the modern system of punctuation. Hence, in the responses of the ancient, oracles, which were
generally written down by the priests and delivered to the inquirers, the
ambiguity--intentional, doubtless --which the want of punctuation
caused, saved the credit of the oracle, whether the expected event was
favorable or unfavorable. As an instance of this kind, may be cited that
remarkable response which was given on a well known occasion when
the oracle was consulted with regard to the success of a certain military
expedition.
"Ibis et redibis nunquam peribis in bello." Written, as it was,
without being pointed, it might be translated either "Thou shalt go,
and shalt never return, thou shalt perish in battle," or " Thou shalt go
and shalt return, thou shalt never perish in battle." The correct titanslation depends on the placing of a comma after the word nunquam, or
after redibis.
The invention of the modern system of punctuation has been attributed to the Alexandrian grammarian Aristophanes, after whom it was
improved by succeeding grammarians; but it was so entirely lost in the
time of Charlemagne that he found it necessary to have it restored by
Warnefried and Alcuin. It consisted at first of only one point, used in
three ways, and sometimes of a stroke, both being formed in several
ways. But as no particular rules were followed in the use of these signs,
punctuation was exceedingly uncertain, until the end of the fifteenthINTRODUCTORY LESSONS.

* In all questions which can be answered by yes or no, (as has been already
stated, under Lesson 6th,) rising inflection of the voice is used. But it may
here be remarked, that when the question is repeated, the repetition is gen.
erally accompaniied by the falling inflection. Btut the reason of this is. that
on the repetition of the question it becomes rather a declaration than a question. Thus, in the question in No. 456, if the person addressed, by reason
of distance or deafiless, does not hear distinctly, and says, What did you
ask me? the reply would naturally be, I asked you, Are you going to

within herself.
LESSON XXIII.
EMPHASIS.
By Emphasis is meant the force or loudness of voice by
which we distinguish the principal word or words in a sentence.
To emphasize a word, means to pronounce it in a loud or
forcible manner.
The meaning of a sentence, especially if it be a question,
often depends upon the proper placing of the emphasis.
Thus: in the sentence, Shall you ride to town to-day? if
the emphasis be placed upon ride, the question will be,
Shall you RIDE to town to-day?- and it may be answered,
No, I shall not ride, I shall walk. If the emphasis be
placed upon you, the question then becomes, Shall YOU
ride to town to-day? and the answer may be, No, I shall
not go myself, I shall send my son. If the emphasis be
placed on town, the question then becomes, Shall you ride
to TOWN to-day? and the answer may be, No, I shall not
ride to TOWN, but I shall ride into the country. If the
emphasis be placed upon day, the question then becomes,
Shall you ride to town TO-DAY? and the answer may be,
No, I shall not go to-day, but I shall to-morrow.
In reading the following sentences, the pupil will emphasize the words in capital letters.

LESSON XXIV.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EMPHASJS.*
In sentences where several words are to be emphasizecd, some
words receive a stronger emphasis than others.  Th1is lea-ls to
t, distinction, called primary and secondary emphasis.  Tthe
primary emphasis is the stronger emphasis.  Tlle secondary
emphasis is the weaker emphasis; of which, there are several
degrees.
In thefollowing sentences, the words in LARGE    CAPl
1 ALS are to receive the primary enmphasis.  Those in SMALL
CAPITALS are to receive the seconclary emphasis, and those in
Italic an enmphasis of less force than those in small capitals.

507. Oh, fear not thou to DIE! But rather feai' to LIVE;'* Although emphasis generally requires a degree of loudness in the voice,
yet it is frequently the case that strongrly emphatic words should be uttered with
a deeper rather than a louder tone of voice. This remark canr be exemplified
better by the living teacher than by examples addressed to the eye.

Antony then brings forward circumstances to prove that Cmesar was not
ambitious; and then asserts that Brutus says he wzas ambitious, notwithstanding these arguments in Caesar's defense. Antony then proceeds to produce further proof to the contrary; and having brought what he supposes an
incontrovertible argument in proof of the injustice of the charge, he then
states the charge as resting merely on the bare assertion of Brutus. Brutus
says so still.

LESSON XXV.
DISTINCTNESS OF ARTICULATION.
in order to exercise the voice, and acquire distinctness of articulation, the pupil is required, in this lesson, to pronounce (as well as he
can) certain letters, which do not constitute a word, and then the
words in which the same letters occur. It is not designed that he
should call the letters by name, but endeavor to p`ronounce the sound
which they represent when united.*
Sound the following letters, and then the words which fol-.
low, in wh7ich the sanme letters occur.'Be particularly careful to give a clear and distinct sound to every letter.
Aw.     Law, saw, draw.
Or.     For, nor.
Bd.     Orbed, probed.
Bdst.   Robb'dst, prob'dst.
Bl.     Able, table, cable, abominable.
Bld.    Troubl'd, humbl'd, tumbl'd.
Bldst. Troubl'dst, crumbl'dst, tumbl'dst.
Blz.    Troubles, crumbles, tumbles.
Blst.   Troubl'st, crumbl'st, turnbl'st.
Br.     Brand, strand, grand.
Bs.     Ribs, cribs, fibs, nibs.
This lesson is deemed by the author one of the most important in the
book, and indispensably necessary to be carefully practised and often repeated
in order to acquire distinctness of articulation. There are some letters andi
syllables, which are very frequently lost by a vicious pronunciation. A native
Bostonian seldom pronounces the final g in the syllable ing. The letters
d, 1, r, t, and the syllable ed, frequently share the fate of the ing, not only
alnong Bostonians, but also amoln the generality of readers and speakers.
The syllable er is almost universally mispronounced, as if it were ur. In the
words merry, and perish, few, if any, mistake the proper sound of the letters
er; but in the words mercy and mersmaid, there are few who give the proper
sound of these letters. The letters aw also are frequently Inispronounced like or.
In order that this lesson may be understood by those teachers, who are not
familiar with the mode in which the sounds of the letters are taught in the
Boston schools, the author deems it necessary to give the following explanation.
Where two vowels, or a vowel and a consonaint, occur together, no difficulty
will occur in pronoulicing the sounds of the letters; btt when several consonants occur together without a vowel, as in the fourth line of this lesson, where
Bedst occur together, it must be understood that each of these letters stands
for a certaini sound, although that sound oe not a clear, articulate one; and
the sounds of each of these letters must be given together, as one syllable,
before the words robb'st and prob'st, in whichl they occur, are read. By such
an exercise the voice will be improved, and ease acquired in the pronunciation
of words in which letters of difficult combination occur.century, when the learned Venetian printers, the Manutii, increased the
number of the signs, and established some fixed rules for their application. These were so generally adopted, that we may consider them as
the inventors of the present method of punctuation; and although modern grammarians have introduced some improvements, nothing but some
particular rules have been added since that time.
The design of the system of Mlanutius was purely grammatical, and
had no further reference to enunciation, than to remove ambiguity in
the meaning and to give precision to the sentence. This, therefore, is
the object of punctuation, and although the marlks employed in written
language may sometimes denote the different pauses and tones of voice
which the sense and an accurate pronunciation require, yet they are
more generally designed to mark the grammatical divisions of a sentence, and to show the dependence and relation of words and members
which are separated by the intervening clauses. The teacher, therefore,
who directs his pupils to "mind their pazuses in reading," gives but an
unintelligible direction to those who are unversed in the rules of analysis.
A better direction would be to disregard the pauses, and endeavor to read
the sentence with just such pauses and tones as they would employ if
the sentence were their own, and they were uttering it in common conversation. The truth of this remark will abundantly appear by a refer
ence to the ninth lesson of this volume, and the directions given in
relation to the comma. Indeed it.is often the case that correct and
tasteful reading requires pauses, and those too of a considerable length,
to be made, where such pauses are indicated in written language by no
mark whatever. [See Lesson X.]
In like manner it will appear, from an inspection of the latter part of
ne ninth lesson, that it is not unfrequently the case that the sense will
allow no pause whatever to be made in cases where, if the marks alone
were observed, it would seem that a pause of considerable length is
required. The pupil, therefore, who has been taught to mind his pauses.
must first be taught to unlearn this direction, and endeavor to understand
the sentence which he is to read before he attempts to enunciate it.
The characters employed in written language are the following:
The Comma,,   The Hyphen,
The Semicolon,;   The Breve,
The Colon,:   The Apostrophe,
The Period,                        The Brace,
The Dash,
The Exclamation,!   The Acute Accent,
The Interrogation,?   The Grave Accent,
The Quotation Marks,      " "    The Circuimflex Accent,
The Diaeresis,                      The Caret,                 A
The Crotchets,               ( )   The Cedilla,.
The Brackets,                [ ]    The Asterisk,              *

536. This will awaken you with lively vigor to the work
of improving your reasoning powers, and seizing every
opportunity and advantage for that end.
537. Consider the weakness, frailties, and mistakes of
human nature in general; the depth and the difficulty of

to believe that the waking
hours of infancy are agreeably taken up with the exercise of vision, or perhaps,
more properly speaking, with
learning to see.

LESSON XXVI.
MANNER, OR EXPRESSION.
In this lesson, the pupil is required to adapt the manner
of his reading to the meaning of the sentences which he is to
read; and endeavor to imitate, as closely as possible, the
s6tones which nature teaches him:to use in common conversac
tionl, or when he is affected by strong feelings.  Th-us, if he
have Such a sentence as the following to read,"Sirrah, savage, dost thou pretend to be ashamed of my
company? Dost thou know that I have kept the best company in England? "He will of course read it in quite a diferent manner from
that which he would use in this which follows:
"Are you sickl, Hubert? You look pale to-day. In
sooth, I would you were a little sick, that I might sit all
night and watch with you. I warrant I love you more than
you do me."
[The following sentence should be read in - an angry

given me? It is as dry as a broomstick; and I shall not
have ten apples on it. You have treated my brother Edmund better than you have me. You have given him a tree
which is full of apples. You ought to make him give me
half of them.
[The following shouldbe read in a milder manner.]
548. Give you half of them?  Your tree was as fruitful
and in as good order as his; but you have not taken good
care of it. Edmund has kept his tree clear of hurtful insects; but you have suffered them to eat up yours in its
blossoms. I shall not direct him to share his apples with so
idle a boy as you have been.

truth, which needs experience more than reason, that the
world is full of guilt and misery; and hast known enough
of all its sorrows, crimes, and cares, to tire thee of it
enter this wild wood, and view the haunts of nature.
555. [Proudly and haughtily.*] Do you pretend to sit
as high on Olympus as Hercules? Did you destroy tyrants
and robbers? You value yourself greatly on subduing one
serpent. I did as much as that while I lay in my cradle.
556. [With fear.] Mirza, terror and doubt are come
upon me. I arm alarmed as a man who suddenly perceives
that he is on the brink of a precipice, and is urged forward
by an irresistible force; but yet I know not whether my
danger is a reality or a dream.
557. [In a threatening manner.] I know thou art a scoundrel! Not pay thy debts! Kill thy friend who lent thee
money, for asking thee for it! Get out of my sight, or I
will drive thee into the Styx.
558. [In a commanding manner.] Stop, I command thee.
No violence. Talk to him calmly.
559. [In a solemn manner.] Such are the excuses which
irreligion offers Could you have believed that they were so
empty, so unworthy, so hollow, so absurd? And shall such
excuses be offered to the God of heaven and earth? By
such apologies shall man insult his Creator?
560. [In a mournful manner.] Oh, my dear, dear mother!
don't you know your son! your poor boy, George?
561. [In a terrified manner.] The Lord have mercy upon
us - what is this?
562. [In a proud, disdainful manner.] Why then dost
thou frown on Fingal? Or shake thine airy spear? But
thou frownest in vain: I never fled from mighty men. And
shall the sons of the wind frighten the King of Morven?
No; he knows the weakness of their arms.
563. [In an energetic manner.] Now launch the boat
upon the wave, - the wind is blowing off the shore  I will
not live a cowering slave on these polluted islands more.

country! nurse of liberty, home of the gallant, great, and
free, my sullen harp I strike to thee. Oh! I have lost you
all! - parents, and home, and friends.
565. [With quickness and emphasis.] Talk to me of
dangers?- Death and shame!- is not my race as high, as
ancient, and as proud as thine? By heaven, it grieves me,
Harry Percy, preaching such craven arguments to me.
566. [ With humility.] Father, I have sinned against
heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be
called thy son.
567. [With horror.] How frightful the grave! how deserted and drear! with the howls of the storm wind--the
creaks of the bier, and the white bones all clattering together.
568. [ With calmness.] How lovely, how sweet the repose
of the tomb!  No tempests are there; --but the nightingales come, and sing their sweet chorus of bliss.
569. [In an authoritative manner.] Heat me these irons
hot; and look thou stand within the arras: when I strike
my foot upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth, and bind
the boy, which you shall find with me, fast to the chair: be
heedful: hence, and watch.
570. [In a supplicating tone.] Alas! what need you be
so boisterous rough?  I will not struggle, I will stand stonestill. For heaven's sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!
Nay, hear me, Hubert! drive these men away, and I will sit
as quiet as a lamb; I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a
word, nor look upon the irons angrily; thrust but these men
away, and I'll forgive you, whatever torments you do put me to.
571. [Solemn caution.] Lochiel! Lochiel, beware of the
day when the Lowlands shall meet thee in battle arrav! for
a field of the dead rushes red on my sight, and the clans of
Culloden are scattered in fight.

These characters, when judiciously employed, fix the meaning and
give precision to the signification of sentences, which, in a written form,
would be ambiguous or indefinite without them. Thus, "I said that he
is dishonest it is true and I am sorry for it."  Now the meaning of this
sentence can be ascertained only by a correct punctuation.  If it be
punctuated as follows: "I said that he is dishonest, it is true, and 1
am sorry for it;" the meaning will be, that it is true that I said he was
dishonest, and I am sorry that I said so. But if it be punctuated thus,
"I said that he was dishonest; it is true; and I am sorry for it;" the
meaning will be, I said that he was dishonest; it is true that he was
dishonest, and I am sorry that he was so.
Again, the following sentence, as here punctuated, is an innocent remarl-: " Believing Richard Brothers to be a prophet sent by God, I have
painted his portrait."' But the sentence as it was originally written by
its author, with the comma after sent, instead of after God, was a piece
of horrid profanity.          u
A further instance of the importance of correct punctuation was
afforded by a late advertisement, in which the commissioner for lighting
one of the most commercial cities of Europe, by the misplacing of a
comma in his advertisement, would have contracted for the supply of
but half the required'light. The advertisement represented the lamps
as " 4050 in number, having two spouts each, composed of not less than
twenty threads of cotton." This expression implied that the lamps had
each twa spouts, and that the two spouts had twenty threads, that is,
each spout had ten threads. But the mleaning that the commissioner
intended to convey was, that each spout had twenty threads; and his
advertisement should have had the comma after "spouts," instead of
after "each," thus: The lamps have two spouts, each composed of
twenty threads, &amp;c.
These instances will suffice to illustrate the nature and the importance
of correct punctuation.
But although the meaning of a sentence is thus materially affected by
the punctuation, it will be seen in the following lessons that the punctuation alone is an unsafe guide to follow in the enunciation of any
collection of words. For, in many cases, these marks indicate no pause,
emphasis, or other remarkable circumstance requiring notice in the enun
ciation of the sentence. [See,Lesson IX., latter part.]
The nature of the marlcs used in written language may also be under
stood by a reference to the origin of their names.

LE SSON XXVII.
PITCH OF THE VOICE.
Every person has three keys, or pitches of the voice, called
THE HIGII, THE ]MIDDLE a2nd THE LO'W KEY.
The HIGH KEY is that which is used ign calling to a iperson
at a distance.
94Thle MIDDLE KEY is that which is used in common con.
versation.
The LOW KEY is that wh7ich is aused when we wish no one to
hear, except the person to whom we speak; and is alnost, but
not quite, a whisper.
Each one of these keys or pitches of the voice has different
degrees of loudness; and it is important that the pupil should
exercise his voice in speaking, in all of these keys, both with
mildness and with force.
[Thle pupil may read the following sentence in each of the
dif'erent keys.]
585. They have rushed through like a hurricane; like an
army of locusts they have devoured the earth; the war has
fallen like a water-spout, and deluged the land with blood.
[Read the following in the high key.]
586. Next Anger rushed; - his eyes on fire, in lightnings
owned his secret stings; in one rude clash he struck his
lyre, and swept with hurried hands the strings.
[Read thefollowing in the low key.]
587. With woful measures wan Despair-- low, sullen
sounds his grief beguiled:--a solemn, strange, and mingled air:--'twas sad by fits, by starts'twas wild.
[Read the following in the middle key.]
588. But thou, O Hope! with eyes so fair, what was thy
delighted measure?  Still it whispered promised pleasure,
and bade the lovely scenes at distance hail!.
589. [Read wzith the high key.] But, with a frown, Revenge impatient rose. He threw his blood-stained sword in
thunder down; and, with a withering look, the war-denouncing trumpet took, and blew a blast so loud and dread, were
ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe. Aind ever and anon
he beat the doubling drum with furious heat: [Low key,
very slowly.] and though, sometimes, each dreary pause between, dejected Pity, at his side, her soul-subduing voice
applied, [High key, rapidly.] yet still he kept his wild, unaltered -mien, while each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his head.
590. [Middle key.] Alexander the Great demanded of a
pirate, whom he had taken, by what right he infested the
seas. "By the same right," replied the pirate, " that Alexander enslaves the world. But I am called a robber, because I
have only one small vessel; and he is styled a conqueror,
because he commands great fleets and armies."

LESSON XXVIII.
TRANSITION.
[It is important that the pupil practise a change or tralRsition of the voice from loud and forcible utterance to E softer
and lower tone; and from rapid to slow pronunciation. In
this lesson he is presented with a few examples in which
such a change of manner is required.]
591. [Softly and slowly.] An hour passed on.    The
Turk awoke. That bright dream     was his last. [More
loudly.] He woke-- to hear the sentry's shriek, [Very laud
and rapid.] " To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek! "
[Slowly and softly.] He woke to die midst flame and smoke,
and shout and groan, and saber stroke, and [Faster and
louder.] death shots falling thick and fast, as lightnings from
the mountain cloud; [Still louder.] and heard, with voice
as trumpet loud, Bozzaris cheer his band; [ Very loud, rapidly, and with mucht animation.] Strike --till the last armed
foe expires-Strike-for your altars and your fires-Strikefor the green graves of your sires, God - and your native land.
[In a softer and slower manner.] They fought - like brave
men, long and well, --they piled that ground with Moslem
slain, - they conquered - [ Very slowly, and in a nmournful
manner.] but Bozzaris fell, bleeding at every vein.
592. [In a gentle manner and low tone.] When, doffed
his casque, he felt free air, around'gan  Marmion wildly
stare: - [Much louder, and in a wild and somewhat angry
manner.] "Where's Harry Blount?   Fitz Eustace, where?
Linger ye here, ye hearts of hare? Redeem my pennon, -
charge again! Cry' Marmion to the rescue.'-- [Very
slowly, and almost in a whisper.] Vain! Last of my race,
on battle plain that shout shall ne'er be heard again! [In.
creasing in loudness.] Yet my last thought is England's:--
[Loucler, and with more earnestness.] fly--Fitz Eustace, to
Lord Surrey hie. [M~ore rapidly.] Tunstall lies dead upon
the field; his life-blood stains the spotless shield: Edmund
is down,- my life is reft,--the Admiral alone is left.

fly! Leave Marmion here alone- to die."
593. [Distinctly, slowly, and in a modZerate tone.] Yet
still Lord Marmion's falcon flew with wavering flight, while
fiercer grew around the battle yell.  [Loudly and juickly.]
"A EIome! a Gordon!" was the cry.
594. [Slowly and withfeeling.] Oh, what a fall was there,
my countrymen! Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
[Loudly and with emphasis.] while bloody treason flourished
over us.
595. [Softly and slowly.] Oh, now you weep; and I perceive you feel the dint of pity: -these are gracious drops.
Kind souls!   [Quickly, louder, and with strong emphasis.]
What, weep you when you but behold our Casar's VESTURE wounded?        [Very loudly and earinestly.] Look ye
here! - here is HIMSELF - marred as you see by traitors.
596. [ Very slowly and sorrowfully.] Oh, I could play
the woman with mine eyes, and braggart with my tongule![With earnestness, louder, and rapidly.] But, gentle heaven,
cut short all intermission; front to front, bring thou this
fiend of Scotland and myself; [Still more forcibly, but with
a lower tone.] within my sword's length set him; if he
escape, heaven forgive him too.
597. [Proudly, and with a loud and angry manner.] But
here I stand and scoff you;-here I fling hatred and defiallce in your face. [In a much milder manner, slowly, and in
derision.] Your consul's    n merciful - For this - all thanks.
[Very loud, and in a threatening manner.       See Number
550.] He dares not touch a hair of Catilitre.
598. [In a low tone, very softly.] His words do take possession of my bosom,--[Louder, and with earnestness.]
Read here, younll  Arthur.   [Very softly.] How now, foolish rheum! turning despiteous torture out the door! I must
be brief, lest resolution drop out at my eyes in tender,
womanish tears. -  [Louder, and as if striving to hide his
tears.] Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?
* The pupil will notice that there are many abbreviations of this kind made
m this book in pieces which appear to be prose. All the sentences which are
poetical have been printed in the formn of prose, to prevent the' sing song "
manlner of reading. But it must be understood and recollected, that although
abbreviations are allowable in poetry, they are nlot admitted in prose.

* This expression, " I wozuld nol have believed no tongze buzt Hubert's,"
is a grammatical error, hardly sanctioned even by the great name of Shakspeare,
from whom it was taken. T'he poets frequently have great liberties allowed
them under the name of poetic license; and the name of Shakspeare "honLors
thlis corriuLtion,." Were it known to a certainty that he was a classical scholar,
the expression above quoted might be pardoned as an idiotism, or imitation of
the Greek construction, in which, double negatives are frequently used to
strengthen the negation. See Clark's Nevw English  Graeznzar, page 141,
Obse,rvation 5, acnd Aizndrewus and Stoddard's Latiln Girazvnzvar, page 303,
~ 325, No. 6, edition of 1836.-Shakspeare and Cowper both use the expressions,
"I lhad as lief not be," and "' I hzad much rather be;" thus joining the auxiliary
of the pluperfect tense with the present.

LESSON XXIX.
ELLIPTICAL SENTENCES.
Arn Ellipsis * means an omission; and when any thing is
omittet, or purposely Icft out, it is said that there is an ellipsis in the sentence, and the sentence is called an elliptical
sentence.
Elliptical sentences occur very frequently; and it is
necessary, in reading such sentences, to supply, in our
minds, all that is omitted, in order to give the proper tone,
accenlt, emphasis, and expression.  Tlhus in the following
questions, -" What went ye out into the wilderness to see?
A reed shaken by the wind? "-- there is an ellipsis or omission of the words " did you go out to see;" and when these
words are supplied, the questions will be, "What went ye
out into the wilderness to see? Did you go out to see a
reed shaken by the wind?
Elliptical sentences must always be read in the same
manner, with the same emphasis, tone, accent, and expression,
that they would be ijf the ellipses were supplied.
In every elliptical sentence, a pause should be made at
every ellipsis long enough to pronounce, or rather to think
over, t7he words which are omitted.
In the folowing sentences, the ellipsis is supplied in Italic
letters, in the form  of a parenthesis.  The pupil will first
read them. as they stand, and then read them with the omission of those _parts which are in Italic letters.
607. What sought they thus afar?      (Did they seek)
Bright jewels of the mine?  (Did they seek) The wealth
of seas? (or) the spoils of war?  (No, they did not seek
either of these, but) They sought a faith's pure shrine.
608. What, then, would it be reasonable to expect from
