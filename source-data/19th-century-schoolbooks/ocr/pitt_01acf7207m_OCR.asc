 PREFACE.

.f\lo‘. 2. contains lessons composed of words of one, two, and
three syllables, and No. 3. of a greater number of syllables, and a
greater variety of composition, both in prose and poetry, selected
from the writings of the best American and English authors.

ltis not from motives of ambition that these numbers are oi’fei‘--
dd._ 0 the puhlick, but from a desire to beneﬁt the cause of elemen-
tary instruction; and, with those engaged in the busm‘e"s's 0'5‘
teaching, it is believed this will be a sufficient apology.

TO TEACHERS.

‘ The practice of teaching a child to read before he is huiiiliar with thin
fcirtlmgi-apl'ty and pronunciation of words, is productive of great injury,
and tends to .retar.l rather than facilitate correct reading. No person
should attempt to read until he is able to call or pronounce, at sight, the
ivortls most commonly met with in cotnposition; and, this can be more
easilyac=.1ttit"ed by reatling words in a judicious and analogical classiﬁca-
tion in a >‘pclling-Book, than in detached reading lessons.

The Author has already‘ published a. small or “ F2'7'st Book,” and 8

fj‘Sg2elli1Lg- Book,” in which "all the words in general use are arranged in.

classes according to the peculiarvowel and consonant sounds, and cal-
culated to render easy and familiar, the principles of iWalker.’s system
of p'ronuncta_tion. ’I‘o these works, he begs leave to refer, those who
may use these numbers; and, he w_ould respectfully suggest the prop ‘ie-
ty of accnstoming the child to pronounce the words in the spelling ‘es
sons, without naming the letters, until he shall be quite familiar u lth
them, a“ practice which will tend greatly to facilitate his reading, by
ehabliitg him to associate the pronunciation of Words with the characters
whit-.lt compose them, to render his enunciation clear and distinct, and
free him from those embarrassntents which too frequently terminate in
a cotttirmcd habit of stamtnering. This "practice the Author pursued
for years while engaged in the business of teaching with results entire-

ly satisfactory ; and his_ experience imboldens him to recommend it to‘

those intrusted with the ins‘tri1ction of youth.

James and George went to a fair;
and there they saw ﬁne things, and
droll tliings too.

They saw shops full of toys, and
cakes, and fruit; and they saw an ape
dance on :1 rope, and drink a glass of
wine.

J ames bought a top and a ball, and
George houghtakite; and the man
who went with them to the fair bought
some nice cakes for them, which they
were glad to have.

They were good boys, and would
not eat too much lest they should be
sick.

So they took but a small cake to
eat then, and kept the rest to bring
home to their friends.

When James and George had seen
all the fine things which were in the

they got home in a short time.

When theycame to the door of
their house, they met four or five boys
from the school to which they Went,
and told them What they had seen;
and James and George took all that
were left of their cakes, and gave a
share to each. i

So they were all glad, both the
boys Who "had been at the fair, and
those who had not. L

The boys thought how kind James

Jane Bruce is also very fond of her
book.

She always does what her papa and
mamma request her, and takes pains
to learn what they are so kind as to
teach her.   ,

She is never noisy or peevish; so;
they like to have her with them, to talk,
to her, and to instruct her.

She has learned -to read so well, and
she is so good a girl, that her mamma
has given her a great many little books,
which she reads, by herself, when she
pleases; and she knows all that is in

LESSON XVI.

 What Jane does, she takes pains to
do Well; and. if she has made :1 1nis-
take, or done any thing wrong, she
is sorry for it; and, when she is told
of a fault, she tries to avoid it in future.

When she wishes to know any
thing, she asks her papa or her inani-
ma to tell her; but if they do not think
proper to answer her questions, she
does not tease them.

She likes to sit by her Inannna, and
sew, or knit; and? she does her work
very neatly, and always keeps it quite
clean and nice.

She likes to feed the chickens and
the young turkeys, and to give them
clean Water to drink.

If all little girls were so good as
Jane Bruce, how much they would
delight their parents and friends; and,
they would be much more happy, than
if they should be idle, or have ill temper.

James, come and go with me, and I

vines.

Here are some large trees in full
blossom.

They will produce very nice plums,
peaches} and cherries, when the b’ .8-

But the melons do not grow on trees.

They grow upon low vines that
lie on the ground.

They might fall on our heads, and
hurt us, ifthey grew on trees.

How bright the sun shines! See
now it rains.

Fruit could not grow if the sun did
not shine, and if it should not some-

It is very pleasant.

Look at the sun.

The sun is in the West.

Yes, because it is going to set.

How pretty the sun is! We can
look at it now; it is not so bright as
it was at noon, when it was up high in
the sky.

And how pretty the clouds are!
There are crimson clouds, and purple
clouds, and yellow clouds like the
colour of gold.

Now the sun is going down very
fast. Now we can see only half of it.

Now we can not see it at all.

But now, Charles, turn your face
the other way, to the east.

\Vhat is it that shines so behind

Is it a fire?

No; it is the moon.

The moon is Very l.arge.

See how red it is! like blood.

The moon is round now, because it

But it will not be so round the
next night; it will los.e‘a.little; "and

the next night a little more; and so‘

on till it is like your bow when it is
bent; and it.will not be seen till; after
you are in bed; and it;.wi1l grow less

and less, till in two weeks there will

be no moon at all. _ L

Then after that, there will be a
new moon;‘ and youwill see it just
before night; and it will be very thin
at ﬁrst.

But it will grow round and larger
each day, till at last, in two weeks
more, it will be a full moon again like
this, and you will see it rise again be-
hind the trees, in four weeks from
this time, just as you see it now.

Miss Griﬂln is so careless, that one

day, after she had asked her aunt to

give her some scarlet netting /twist, to

rnake a purse for her brother, she did it

Wrong and tangled the silk into knots.

Then being vexed and tired of the
Work, which it seems she did not know
any thing about, she twisteod the silk
up and tossed it into the litter basket,

and her oousin’s little pet lapdog ran

off with it fora plaything.

This conduct and waste of silk by
Miss Griffin did so muehooffend her
aunt, that she will never again give
her things to such a careless girl,who
does so much mischief.

If you learn a little each day, you

PREFACE.

TH-E Author has long considered that a series of elementary
Reading—Books, which shall contain a greater variety of subjects,
better adapted to .the capacities and tastes of children, than any
now in use, vlsjould be an acquisition to our already extended list
of Class-Boo s. '

Works designed for instructing children in reading, should
treat of such subjects as are within the range of their experience,
pleasing to their “imaginations, and chaste and progressive in style
and matter; for, it must be obvious to every reflecting mind,
that the rudiments of correct reading are more likely to be ac-
quired when the subject and language are easily understood by

the child, than when these are above his comprehension. But -

while the subject matter should be within the reach of the child’s
capacity, care should likewise be taken that it be of a useful and
moral tendency. The practice of giving children dialogues be-
tween wolves and sheep, cats and mice, &c. &c., often met with
in elementary Reading-Books, containing statements and details
of things whlch never did, and which never can take place, is as
destructive of truth and morality, as it is contrary to the prin-
cipies of nature and .philosophy. '

In preparing these numbers, great pains have been taken so
to arrange the different lessons, as to lead the child by a regular
gradation from easy to difficult reading, to adapt the subjects to
his advancement, and to place before him such matter, and such
only, as shall convey to the juvenile mind correct views, and just
principles of morality. It has also been the particular aim of the
Author, to exhibit, in the course of the lessons, all the words 0‘
variable or doubtful orthography, in the English language.

No. 1. contains short and easy lessons, in which there are no
words of more than two syllables, and the language, it is numbly
