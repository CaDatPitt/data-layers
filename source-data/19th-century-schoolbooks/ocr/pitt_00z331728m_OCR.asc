that your letter gave me great pleasure on many accounts but above all, by letting me see that you are
not only perfectly at ease, and hlappy ill your late
change of condition, but futrnished with all thie materials proper to secure that happiness for life; since the
prirnciples whlich you lay down for your conduct in it,
cannot fail to draw every good out of it, wlhich it can
possibly yield. Youtng ladties whto htave been admired
as beauties, are apt to consider a husband as an acquisiti(on of conquest, and to be slhocked at the thought
of being reduced by marriage to a state of subjection;
and..fi r'i a resolution to shake off this yoke, often lay
the fimundation of a contest- which begins with matrimory itself; and conitinues sometimes to the end of it4

hiusband will never require more of it than is due  and
a kind one will always be content withl less, and when
convinced of the disposition, will generally dispense
with the act. As your profession, I dare say, is sincere, I may trust you with a paradox, whichl you will
certainly find to be true, that the more submissive you
are, the less you will be obliged to submit; and sliould
it be your ambition even to govern, you will accomplish it withl the most ease, by acknowledging yourself
a subject.
Betwveen a tmarried couple of sense and affection,
for it is withl such only that any happiness can be found,
there can hardly be any dispute but what must turn
upon trifles, or the con' rast, perhaps, of some little habits, whlich, thlough indifferent in themselves, cannot
suffer a contradiction without some regret. But as
these are common to both sexes, a(nd every person has
his foibles in some degree or other, it miust be the business of reason to make this mniatter easy by mutual
compliances, or a cartel, as it were, of exchangeCONGRATULATORLY LETTERS6
where those, however, whlo hlappen to yield( thle Iostg
wvill, by that conquest over themnselves, which of all

nmusician, a reflection has sometimines occurred to mey

duced to wondler why the marriei(l pair, wto are mlutually the instrunents of that harmony on which each
other's combfort d(lependls, slhould be generally so regardless of the necessary care of tuniing, or reducing~
each othler's temlper to its proper tone, by softening it
when too sharp, and raising it when too low: fbr I alm

close. Bitt the comparison will not hold, fort thie
experiment will always be dlngerous in the married
state, wlhere, they mlay be comnpared m)ore justly to
those slighlt indispositions of the body, which, though
they ldo not thlreaten the ruin of the whlole, yet are apt
to weaken some part; ald wlhose proper use is to admonish us to guard our health with the greater care. In
sh.rt, if two enemies should be forced by any accident
to he comnrades for life, the necessity of the thing, would
oblige them  to become friends.  The same reason
tlien, one would thinik, should more strolngly ciigage a pair of friends, tied together by cl-hoice and affection in a partnerslhip inseparable, to extirpate every
seed of discord, that mighlt possibly arise betwrixt

partialities; you are entirely ignorant of party distinctions; and you look with a perfect indifference on

how unfit I am  still for it, since my disordered

express the deepest sorrow, and my mind is confused. But such mene as you, and particularly one so

ready done by your kind letter, and excellent prayer. I endeavour to mnake the best use I etn of both;
but I am so unworthy a creature, that though I
have desires, yet I have no dispositions, for receiv.

thoughts are filled with false notions, difficulties, and
doubts: but this I hope to make the occasion of humiliation, not of sin. I know I lhave deserved my
punishment,-and I will be silent under it; but secretly my heart mourns, too sadly I fear, and cannot be
comforted, because I have lost the dear companion
and sharer of all my joys and sorrows. Can I regret
his quitting a less good for a greater? 0! if I did
steadfastly believe, I could not be dejeeted. For I
will not injure myself by saying, that I offer my mind
any inferior consolation to sulpply my loss. No; I
most willingly forsake this world, this vexatious,
troublesome world, in whiche I have no other business,
but to rid miy soul from sin; secure, by faith and a
good conscience, my eternal interests; with patienee
andtie-courage, bear my eminent misfortunes; and(

leave at once to wave all yolurl compliments, aind to collect only this in general fromi thlem, that yoour design

advices and free sentiments, whichl miglht make me
wiser and happier. I know it is the general opinion,
that frienldship iS best contrhcted betwixt persons of
equ al age; but l have so muclh interest to be of another
mindit, that you nust pardon me if I caTnnot forbear
telling you a few hotions of mine, in opposition to that
opiniion.
In the first place, it is observable, that the love we
bear to our friendis, is enerally caused by our finding
the sanie dispositions in thlem, whliclh we feel in ourselves. This is only self-love at the bottom: butt the
affiection betwixt people of different ages cannot well
be so, thte inclinations of such being commonly variotus. qlie friendship of two youlng men is often occasione(l by love of pleasure, each being desirous for his
own sake of one to assist or encourage hii-m in tlhe
colurlse he pursues; as tlhat of two old imen is fequelltly on the score of somne p1rofit, lucre, or design upon
others. Now, as a young man, who is less acquainted with thle ways of the world, has in all probability
less of interest; an(I ai ol(1 nian, who miay be weary
of himself, has, or should have, less of self-love: so
thle friendship between them is the more likely to be
true, anld unmixe(d with too much selfregardl. One
may add to this, tthat such} a fr'iendshipi) is of greaterI ulse
and advantage to bothi: for the old 1 man wvill prob ably
becone agreeable to please the young one, and tihe
younug m~an mnore discreet andi prudent by the help of
the old one; so it may prove a cure of thiose epidemical d(liseases of age and youthl, sourniess and madness.
I hope you will not need many arguments to convince
you of the possibility of this: one alone abundtlantly
satisfies me, an(1 convinces to the heart; whichi is, that

You formerly observed to me, that nothing

the disparity we often find in him sick and well: thus
one of an unfortunate constitution is perpetually exhibiting a miserable example of the alternate weakness
of his mind,l and of hlis bodly. I hlave had frequent opportunities of late to considler mnyself ir tlhese diferent'vieWs; and, I hope, I have received some advantage
by it.  If what Waller says be true, that

POPE'S LETTERS.
LETTER IIIJMr. Pope to the honourable  
July 13, i71,4
I canlot tell from any thing in your letterr
whether you received a long one from me about a fortnighlt since. It was principally intended to thank you
for the last obliging favour you did me; and perhaps
for that reason you pass it in silence. I there launched into some account of my temporal affairs; and I intend now to give you somie hints of my spiritual. T'he
conclusion of your letter, in which you tell me you
prayed for me, draws this upon me. Nothing can be
more kind than the hint you give me of the vanity of
human sciences, whlicht, I assure you, I amn daily more
convince(l of; and indeed, I have, for somie years past,
looked upon all of them as no better thlan amusements.
To make them the ultimate end of our pursuit, is a miserable and shlort ambition, which will drop from us at
every little disappointment here; and even, in case of
no disappointments here, will infallibly desertus here,
after. Thie utmost fame they are capable of bestowing,
is never worth the pains they cost us, and the time they
lose us. If you attain the summit of your desires that
way, those wvho envy you, will do you hlarm; and of
those who admire you, few will do you good. And at the
iupshot, after a life of perlpetual application, you reflect
that you have been (loing nothing for yourself: and
that the samne or less industry might have gained you
a friendship, that can never deceive or end; a satisfaction, whlichl praise cannot bestow, nor vanity feel;  
and a glory whliclh though, in one respect like fame, not
to be hliad till after dleatlh, yet shlall be felt and enjoyed to
eternity. These, dear sir, are unfeignedly my sentiments, whienever I thiink at all; for half the thinrgs
that employ our heads, deserve not the name of

poetry, are all but so many shadowy imiages, and airy
prospects, which arise to us so much tlhe livelier
anid mnore frequent, as we are more overcast withl the
darkness, and disturbed with the fuimes, of human
vanity.
The same tlhing that makes old men willing to leave
this world, makes me willing to leave poetry; long
habit and weariness of the same track. I should be
sorry and ashamed, to go on jingling to tlhe last step,
like a wagoner's horse, in the same road; and so leave
tmy bells to the next silly animal that will be proud of
thlem. That man makes a mean figure in the eyes of
Reason, whlo is measurintg syllables aind coupling
rhymes, wheni he should be mending his own soul, and
securing his own immlortality. If I hiad inot this opinion, I shoutld be unworthy even of these small and limited parts whlich God has given mne; and unworthy of

these things. At home we follow ouir business, when

when we have none. Our friendship is not unlike
that of a staid man and his wife, who are seldom so
fond as to hinder the business of the hlouse from going
on all day, or so indolent as not to find consolation in
each other every evening. Thlus, well..meaninlg couples
hold in amrity to the last, by not expectin, too much
from human natutire; wlile romniantic frienld-ships, like
violent loves, begin withi disquiets, proceed to jealotisies, and conclude in animosities. I lhave lived to see
the fierce advancement, the sudden turn, and the
ablrupt period, of thlree or four of thiese eniormous
friendships: and I am perfectly conivinced of the truth
of our maxim, that nothing lindeirs tlhe constant agreement of people whlo live together, so much as vanity;
a secret insisting upon what they think their -dignity
of merit; and an. inwar(l expectation of such an overmeasure of deference and regard, as aniswers to their
own extravagant false scale; and whlich nolody can
pay, because none btit tihemtnselves can tell exactly to

The samine reason that hind(lered your writing,

you in town. Indeed, since the willing confinemient I

it is the very warmiest in the hlouse. We and our
fires will equally smile upon your face. There
is a Persian proverb tlhat says, I thinlk, very prettily;
" Tle conversation of a friend brighltens the eyes."
This I take to be a spleindour still miore agreeable
than the fires which you so delightfully describe.
May you long enjoy yoliur own fire-side in the metaph-orical sense, that is, all thtose of your family who
make it pleasi ng to sit and spend whole winitry months
together; a far more rational deliglit, and l)etter felt

calmed, I will endeavour to follow your advice, and
turn it to something -of use and moment, if I have
still life enough left to do any thing thlat is worth
reading and preserving. In the mean time, I shall
be pleased to hear that you proceed in what you intend, with-out any such melancholy interruptions as
I have had. Your minid is as yet unbroken by age
and ill accidents; youri knowledge and judgment are
at the heighlt: use them in writing something that
may teachl the present and futture times. Remember
Virgil died at fifty-two, and IHorace at fifty-eight;
and bad as both their constitutions were, yours is
yet more delicate and tender. Employ not your pre-,
cious mnoments, and great talents, on little men and
little things: but choose a subject every way worthy of you; and handle it, as you can, in a manner
which nobodfly else can equal or imnitate. As for me,
my abilities, if I ever had any, are not vwhat they
were; and yet I will endeavour to rIecollect and employ them:

Sanguis hebet, frigenttque effceto in corpore vires."
However, I should be ungrateful to this place, if I
did not own that I have gained upon the gout in the
South of France much more thatn I did at Paris,
tlhoughll even there 1 sensibly improved. I believe
my cure hlad been perfected. but the earnest desire
of meeting one whom I dearly loved, called me abruptly to A1ontpelier: wlhere I continued two
mondhs, under the cruel torture of a sad and frutitless expectation; and( I was forced at last to take a
long journey to I'Toulouse. And' even there I had
missed the person I sought, lad( shle not, withi great
spic'it and (coultage, ventured all nighit up lte Garonne
to.see me, which shlie albove all things desired to (1do
before she died. By tshat means, shle was brought.
where I was, between seven and eight in thlu morning. She lived twenty hours afterwards: whicht
time was not lost on either side, but passed in sueh
a manner as gave great satisfaction to both; and
such as, on her part, every way became her circumstances and character. She had her senses to the
very last gasp; and she exerted them to give me,
in those few hours, greater marks of duty and love
than shle had( done in all her life-timne, thlough she
had never been wanting in either. The last words
she said to me, were the kindest of all; a reflection
on the goodness of God, which had allowed us in this
manner to meet one more. Not many minutes after that, she laid herself on her pillow, in a sleeping
posture,
placidlaque ibi demurm morte quieviL."
Judge, sir, what I felt, and still feel, oni this occasion; and spare me the trouble of describing it. At
mny age, under my infirniities, among utter strangers,
how shlall 1 find out proper reliefs and supports? I
can have none but those with which Reason and Religion furnish me; and on those I lay hold, and grasp
as fast as I can. And I hope that HIE who laid the
burthen upon me, (for wvise and good purposes, no
(loubt,) will enable me to bear it, in like manner as
I have borne others, witlh some degree of fortitude
and firmness.
You see how ready I am to relapse into an argut
ment which I had quitted once before in this letter.
1 shall probably again comnmit the same fault, if I
continue to write; and therefore I stop short hlere,
and, with all sincerity, affection, and esteem, bid you
adieu, till we meet, either in this world, if God
pleases, or else in another!

My preselnt experience confirms me in this trutlh.
Tlhe powers of nature are drooping; the vital spa-k

ib'or their happiness was never more ardent.''This makes me employ some of the last part of nmy

When I wrote to you last I was under such
amazement and agony, that I d(o not know what I
mnigh-t say to you; but you will excuse the overflowings of my heart, in its (leepest sorrow. In no moment of my life, shall I be less sensible of our loss than
at present: but though it is impossible to be unmoved
at the reflection, that we have been deprived of the
noblest happiness wlich Providence had bestowed on
ius; yet frequenit meditation on the unequal virtues of
oulr friend, will changegrief into veneration, and raise
i3S2RUNDLE'S LETTERS.
and consecrate thle pious melancholy into a solemn enjoyment, to be preferred to pleasure.
All parties are striving, in their public papers, whichl
shall profess the hIighlest esteem and honour for him;
and tlhey mention hlis behaviour in his great office, with
the warmest gratitude and applause. These praises,
which prove thle greatness of our misfortune, bring, at
the same time a consolation withl them,. It gives me a
lovely view of mankind, to observe;, that they canr (Irop
their prejudlice, and unite to reverence a truly great
anid admirable chiaracter. Notlhing is universally popular but goodness! And every action of his life, in
publ)lic or private, towards his friends or his enemies,
flowed, firom that (livinle principle, in which alone we
canl obey that sublime preceipt of our Lord, (the sublimest that can be given to men or angels,)  Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect." Did I say
his enemiies?-he had none; hle hated none but ill men;
nay, even for thlem, he felt not hlatred, but pity.
It has been observed, that the worl(l seldom- does
justice to characters, till after men have been some
time dead; but it has not been so now. Thle chlancellor was dear to his prince and to the peop)le, whilst he
lived; and lie is equally mourned by both, as soon as
he is (lead. He was truste(l by thie prince, as his most
faithful and zealous servant; and regarded by the
jealous nation, as the warmest and most intrepid
lover of their liberties: bothl thought their righlts

Hagley, Oct., 1751.
Dear sir,
MAy concern was so great on the account I
received from thle bishlop of Worcester of the ill state
of your thealthl, that in the midtst of my grief for the
death of my fatlier, when I had scarcely performed my
last ldulties to him, I wrote to you at Bristol; wlich
letter, [ find, you never received. Indeed, my dear
fieiend, there are few losses I shlould miore sensibly
feel thian yoturs, if it shotuld( please God to take you
front us. But I trust, he will be so gracious to your
famnily and your friends, as to prolong your life, and
defer your rewvard for some time longer. And I am
persuadetl, no ltumian means can be found better than
that whiclt hlas been prescribed to you of removing to
Lisbon, and passing the winter in that mild climate:
only let me entreat you to lay by all studlies while you
are tlere; for too mnuch application (and a very little
in your state is too mlich) would frustrate the benefit
which we may hope fromin the chlange of air. The
c0m)lying withl this injunction, wvill be the best recompense you cain miake Mrs. Doddridge for all the
obligationis you hlave to, her.; antd if I h1ave any authority withi you, as 1 flatter myself I have, I would
emi,loY it all to enforce thtis upon you, for. 1 do indeed
think your life wvill (lepend upon it. You have, I believe, broughlit on your illness by continual study and
labour; atnd an entire remission of mind is absolutely
necessary for your recovery.
My fatlier met death with a noble firmness, and an
assured hope of a blessed immnortality; so that our
thoug.hts are raised above our grief, and fixed much
more on tihe example lie. hlas left us, than on thile loss ve

the small revenue it has pleased God to bless mie withl;

and this I do with much greater satisfaction thlan
others spend theirs on their pleasures. I can assure
you my chtief concernt on this occasion, was for an incomparable mother, whom I feared the misfortunes of
a favourite daughter would too much affect. But, I
thank God, religion, that religion of whlich you make
so amiable drawings in all your works, was more than
-a sutpport to her. -T'I'bis is a subject I never choose to
talk of; yet I could Inot forbear mentioning it to a man
whom I much esteem, and whlose hieart I know to be
right.
It was withl great concern I found Mrs. Doddridge
so ill at Bathi. I know the grief this must have occasioned you. But I know your sufficiency. I trust in
God shle has by this time received the expected benefit
from the waters. It was by accident that I sawv her
name in Leake's book, (for then I hlad not received
your last letter,) a little before I left Mr. Allen's. I
visited hler twice. The first time, she was going olut
to drink the waters; the second time, a visiting: so
I had not the pleasure of much of her company. You
may be assured, I would not hinder her the first tinme;
and I madle a conscience not to do it the second: for
it was a new acquaintance she wvas going to make; a
matter perhaps as usefiul to her amusement, while she
stayed at Bath, as the other for her healtlh.  
Thus you see, my good friend, we hlave all somethling to make us thlink less comnplacently of tlhe worll.
Rleligion will do great thlings.  It will always mnake

and I should9, I think, do tlhe same, if I were a mereo

pleasures of it, equally takes us off from the work of

good as any; who, on his return from an important
coinmission, when asked by his master whether they
should mark the day wvith black or a white stone, rcplied: "Sir, if you will he ruled by me, with neither; but with good brown ochre."     What tis philosopher thought of his commission, I think of human life in general; good brown ochre is the complexion of it.
I returned home a little before (Christmas, after a
charming philosophical retirement, for two or three
months, in a palace, with Mr. Pope and iMr. Allen.
rlThle gentleman wiliomni I mentioned last, is, I verily
believe, the greatest private character that ever appeared in any age of the world.   You see his munificence to the Bath Hospital.   This is but a smuall
part of his charities; an(l charity but a small l)art
of hlis virtues.  I have studied his chlaracter even
maliciously, to find where his weakness lies; but I
have studied in vain.   Whenl  I know it, the world
shall know it too, for the consolation of the envious;
especially as I suspect it will prove to be only a par.

* Mr. Allen rose to great consideration by farming the cross
posts; which, very much to the putblic advantage, as well as his

He was of so generouts a natutre, that his mintd enlarged with his
fortune; and the wealtlh whilich he tlhuts honourably acquired, he
spent in a splendid hospitality, and( in the most extenlsive charities.
His house, in so public a scene as that of Bath, was open to mer

Are you still, dear miss Carter, in the
most forlorn and joyless of all deserts,-a London
solitude? or do you breathe again a freer air among
the groves of Enfield? Be yotur situationr what it
will, are your nerves and spirits better? When ouar

is happy. Indeed, I si-ncerely pitied you for a turn of
thought, whichl you very strongly express, and I liave
often very strongly aind painfully'felt,-a restless
an(d insatiable desire of improvemlent, and suchl a
sense of the nothingness of all one thinks, a(d dloes,
and( can do, as damps ever-y pursuit. But, upon after
consideration of this subjeet, l:have at last satisfied
-myself withi the pe rsuasion, tihat our businless, in thlis
state of being, is only to aim at improvemenIt andl information; and that, as the attainnment of it in any
satisfactory degree is reserved to a better, we ouglht
to sit down here contented, if we find oiurselves in a
teachable and diligent ftrame of min d, and hIave rleason to believe th~at we d(lo outr best, let that best, be
ever so poor. Lite would not be filled up with so
many necessary trifles, if employments of dignity
and real worthi were the thiings belonging- to us; but
as pride and vanity are perhaps outr stronwest and
most danrgerous natural bent, it was highly filt we
shoutld be perpetually reminded what poor crtceatures
we are. A right disposition of miti(l is the highest
imiproverrment we are capable of miaking 1here; andl to
the attainment of this, all otur infirmities, all thIe interruptions of' our favourite sttudies, all tlhat we usually reckon hindleranes, (lis'tresses, or disadvantages, abundantly contrihtoe.  I hope this is not a

but only, that whenever we find it (by what Ineanis
soever) actually out of our rIeach, our minds should

shlould prove bad companions, a book shall amuse

wherever I hlave dipped into it accidentally, has given me thle highlest pleasure. What the authtor says
of the grandeur ai(d miisery of humnan nature, takeI
bothl together, seems to ime to give thie justest notions
of life; nor is it at all painful to consider the dark
side of this prospect, when one knows thlat, unless
thinigs are by wilful folly put out of their due course,
the sunshine is to be continually gaining ground, and
the shlades vanishing before it, till at last the poor,
wretehled, ereeping animal thlrows off its imperfec -
tions, and shlines forth in great dignity and lustre.
But even tlhen, though every stuch highly imnproved
being will deserve great degrees of love and esteem,
no one surely will, or can, (leserve so strong andt partial an attaelhment, as is, by some affectionate hearts

RMISS TALBOT'S LETTERS.
Have I been very busy, you ysk? Whly really if I
have, it has not been to much purpose; tfor I can re.
collect but little that I hlave done. Have I then beeii
very idle? I hlearttily hope not, for that is against all
my principles and resolutions. Not one of h:le places
appropriate(l to dissipation have I appeared in tllis
year. I have lived on quietly ftrom day to day: less
at home than I should choose, if mere choice were
the rule to be followed; and yet less with the friends,
in goinig to whom I hlave spent so much time, the
distance from one end of this huge townII to the othler
being immense. If my time runs out thus imperceptibly without any visible expense, there must be
some secret cheat I put upon myself, which ouglht
to be well looked into; and I thank you for calling
upon me to mnake the examiination.
I do not tell you, however, that I haven?It written
many letters. read many books, spent muchtel time in
company of excellent people whlom I love, and a
great deal in such exercise as was indispensably requisite for my health: but it is almost necessary in
this place to live "au jour la journe,"9 and giving
up all schemes and choices of one's own, to despatch
such employments as thei present momient more immediately calls for. And, I think, Epictetus says
excellent things on this head; and affirms that one
ought not to be always sighing after leisure, but to
know how to live somnetimes witlhout it. But I do
sigh very often to feel a dea(ld weight of unimproved
time upon my hands, in the visits of this town, when
a whole afternoon's conversation is wasted on the
most uninteresting trife4s. Would time really stand
still so long, thiis wretched trifling miight be less iuni
pardonable. But timne flowNs on in the same rapid
course; an(l while we stil trifle, eternity is upon us.
A gracious Providence calls lipol us, by the loudest
alarms,* to hasten and finish ouI' appointed work;

and we carelessly divert outr attention to objects undeserving the serious contemlp)lations of a monkey. I
do not call it trifling, to be gay witht our friends; to
enliven the circle of social g0od humour; to improve
all our talents, small as well as great, to the praise of the
Giver; thlankfully to enjoy and admiire even his least
an(l most common bounties; to refresh ourselves with
lneedfil relaxation; anid to indulge, at fit times, the innocent sportings of fancy. But I have no patience
with the false politeness of the world which banishes
every slubject that is interesting and delightful, if it
bears but the naime of seriousness, to introduce every
one that is dutll ati, tiresomne, meiely because it is uniniportant. Some striking subjects have indeed forcedi themselves upon every body's attention thlis winter:

no sort of panic. I feel an earnest desire to be the better myself, and as earnest a one that every body else

sublime would be very apt to lead me to tlhe full view
of a tempest, thouhgl I could not stand the shock of
seeing any one sufFer b)y it, but I shiould quit my station, as you wouild do, in thle like case. The person
who coutild survey the hoxiors of a storm witl scarcely
any (olther sentimient than a cool reflection on its general advantages, would be very little the better for such
a contenmplation. Universal an( reminote consequences would operate very fainitly on our reason, if tile
heart xwere not, by Infinite Wisdom, fo rmed to feel the
private and immnediate stroke. By this, it is awed
and softened to such a sense of hluman weakness and
depeindence, as leads it inlto a state the most friendly
to virtue. Reason, on which11 we are so apt to build our

Clarges Street, Jan. 15, 1770.
Yout will be so kintidly solicitous about mre, my
dear Mrs. Vesey, when you see in the papers a confirmnation of the reality of miy apprelhenisions about my
dear miss Talbtt, that I cannot forbear writiig you
some accoIIunt of myself. I am tolerably well; and imy
spirits, though low, are very composed. With tile
deepest feeling of my own unsp eakable loss of onie of
the dearest and most invaluable blessings of my lifec
I am to the highlest degree thankful to the Divine
goodniess for removing hler from the mutltiplied and aggravated sufferings, which, in a longer-struggle with

such a distemper, nmutst have been unavoidal)le. Tlhle
calm and peaceable sorrow of tenderness and affection,
sweetly alleviated by the joyful assurance of her happiness, is a dlelightful sentiment comipared withI what I
lhave suffered for these last two or three months.
A few days before hler deatlh, slhe was seized with a
sudden hoarseness and coLughl, whtich seem/ed the effect
of a cold, and fiom which bleeding relieved h1er; butt
tihere remained an oppression from p)hlegmn whiclh was
extremely troublesome to her. On the nintlh, this
symlnptom  inerease(l; and she appeared heavy and
sleepy, which was attributed to an opiate she hlad taken
the night before. I staid with her till she went to bed,
with an intention of going afterwards into hler room;
but I was told( she was asleep.- I went away about
nine. In less than an h1our, she waked; and after the
struggle of scarcely a minute, it pleased God to remove
her pious soutl from its mortal sufferings to thiat Heayen for whichl her life had: been anr uninterrupted preparation. Never surely was there a lovelier pattern
of evangelical good ness, decorated by all the ornaments
of a highly improved understanding, and recommemnded by a sweetness of temper, an elegance and politeness of manners, of a peculiar and more engaging kind
than in any other chlaracter I ever knew.
I amn jutst returned fromn seeing all that was mortai
of mny angelic friend deposited in the earth. I do not
mean that I went in ceremony, which would hiave beenl
too strong a trial forn my spir-its; but privately with

a comifort to mne, on that most solemn occasion, to thank
Almighty God for deliverling hlier from her sufferings,

LETTER I~
To JIrs. Vesey.
Deal, June 3, 1778e
Our two letters I believe, mny dear Mrs.
Vesey, met each othler on the road: and it is pleasant
to think that perhaps at the same instant they conveyed to us our affectionate remembrance of each
otlher. I have been about ten days settled ill- my little quiet abode; an,d very thankful I ain for suchl a
habitation. I had( tllhe happiness you kindly wished
me of finding my fiiendls, I thlank God, very well.
Amnidst all the gratitude which I owe, and whlich I
can never sufficiently pay, to Heaven, for the greater
number of those wlho still survive, I feel mucllh dejection at missing those who once used to welcomre my
return, and now welcome it no more! Buit they, I trust,
are at peace.  Anid this thoughlt would give me utnabated comfort, if the same argutments tlhat convince
the understanding, and awe tl-he mind to resignation,
could sLubdue the fond affections of the heart, whlich
retains its weak regrets,
" Sol perche troppo sente, e poco credle."
Yet perhlaps the evil would be worse, if the objects
of our tenlderness coutld he replaced, and newv engagements make us entirely forget those th-jat are suspenld
ed by the stroke of (leatil. Tlhe world would then hold(
us in evei'lasting chains, and we should lose one powverfil motive for looking forward to the prospect of a

better. Every infliction of Providence in thlis world,
is graciously designed to animate our endeavours for
that where sorrow shall be no more. In the mean
time, let me comfort myself in the thlought that the survivers are the only mourners; and that the spirits of
the friends who are at present removed fiom tIleir society, are possessed of a degree of hapl)iness infinitely
superior to all that the fondest affection of the families
to whomn they were so (lear, could procure for them
in a world like this.
My mind, at present too much (lisposed to sinking,
yarticularly felt, what at any time would have given
me pain, your seenming to raise a doubt of your coming to England. But I will hlope it was only a transient cloud passing over your own miniid. Pult)blic affairs do indeed carry a thlreatening appearance: butit
you and I remember when the danger was as great, or
perhaps greater; whien a rebel army was in thie midst
of the kingdomi, and an invasion alarmetl the extremities. That storm, God be thanked, blew happily over; and the same gracious Providence may avert
the present imnpending calamities. Our national provocations against Heaven are very great; but there
are, I trust, in the walks of private life, so many who
proceed( uniformly in a course of duty, thlat the proportion, one may hlope, is much greater than that

LETTER I.
Dr. Iornte to Dr. Jidam Smnith.*--On the life, death,
and philosophy, of David Hlume, esq.
Sir,
Yout have been lately employed int ellmbalmini
a philosophler; his body, I believe I must say: for
conce rning thle othler part of him, neither you nor he
seems to have entertained an idea, sleeping or waking.
Else, it sutrely mighlt have claimed a little of your
care and attelition; anid one would think, the belief of
tlhe soul's existence and imrmortality couild do no hlarm,
if it (lid no good, in a'6 Thleory of Moral Sentimernts."  But every gentleman understands his own
business best.
Will you do ani unknown corresponident the honout,
sir, to accept a few plain remarks, in a free, easy
way, upon the curious letter to Mr. Strahan, in whicht
this memorable operation of embalmingil, is l)erformned  
Our philosophier's account of liis own life, shliall likewise libe considered as we go ailolng.l
Trust me, good doctor, I am no bigot, enthusiast,
nor einemy to -humain learning. I have made mrany a
hearty nmeal, in private, upon Cicero and Virgil, as
well as MIr. Houme. Few persons, though lperliaps,

as Mr. Hunie says, upon a like occasion, I oughlt not
to judge on tlhat sublject," hlave a quicker relish for
thle producetions of genius, an,d the beauties of composition. It is, tlherefore, as little in my intention, as
it is in my power, to prejtudlice thle literary character
of your tiiecnd. Fromi his Ilistory of England I have
received great pieasure; and I have ever esteemed it
to be a noble effOrt of 6, matter and motion."  But
wlhen a man takes it into his hiead to do mischief, you
nmust be sensible, sirt, tllat tlhe public hlas always rea-.son to lainent lhis being a,, clhver f-llow."
I lhope it will not be (leelned vanityin ine likewise
to say, that I have in my conl-position a large proportion of i thle milk of thuilan- kindness."  L have never
klnown whIat elnvy or hatred is; andll  am rea(dy, at all
timnes, to praise, wherever I ca3n do it in hlonour and
conscience. David) 1 dotibt nll, was, as yout afflirm,
a social, agreeasle person, of a con-vivial turni, told a
good Story, and played well at 66 1-his faivourite gam.ne of
whist."  I know not that John tlhe Paintter (lid tlhe

Concerning tile, philosolphical opilli)ons" of Mr.

variou sly." lThey are certainly at liberty so to (0o,
becautise tie author lhimself did the same. Sonmetimies,
to be sure, hle esteemed tl-heml ingenious, deep, subtile,
elegant, a(nd calculated to diffuse his literary fame to
the'ends of thie world. But, at other times, lhe judged very differently. " I dine," says lie, " I play a
game at backgammon, I contverise, and am merry with
miy friends; altd when, after thlree or foulir hoursamunsement, I would return to thlese speculations, tiley
appear so cold, so strained, and so ridiculous, that [

tiher."  Now, sir, if you' will only give me leave to
judge, befoIre dinner, of Mr. Hume's lphilosol)phy, as he
judged of it after dinner, we shlall have no farther dispute upon that subject. I coul(l indeed wishl, to have
a scheme of thoughlt, whlich wvould bear contemplating,
at any timie of the (lay; because, othlerwise, a person
must be at tlhe expense of maintaining a brace of these
metaphysical hlobby-lhorses, one to mount in thle morning, and tlhe other in thle afternoon.
After all, sir, friend as I am to freedom ofopinion,
(and nlo one living can be more so,) I aim ratlher sorry
that men sholuld judge so variously of Mr'. Hume's
phiilosophical specuLlations. For since tlhe design of'
t;hemn is to banishi ouit of tlhe world( every idea of truth
and coiffort, salvration and( immniortality, a fuiture
state, and the provi(ldenice and even the existence of
GOD, it seems a pity, that we cannot all be of a mind
about them. And 1 could Ihave been well pleased to
have been infotrmeid by you, sir, that, before hlis (leath,
le had ceased to number among his happy effusions,
tralts of this kiind and( tenldency.
Lit ine conime a little closer to you, doctor, if you
Ipleae, upon this subject. Do not be tinder any apprehensions: my name does not begin withl a B. Are
yout sure, and can you make us sutire, that there really
exist no sIlcIl thiiigs as a GoD, andl a future state of
rIewards atnd punishmlents? If so,( all is well.  Let us
then, in our last hours, read Lucian, and play at whlist,
and droll upon Charon ad h1is lboat; let uts die as
foolish and insensible, as miuch like ou' brother p-ilosophers, the calvyes of the field, arid llhe asses of the
desert, as we cai,.  Blit, if suchl things are, as thley
certainly are, is it riglht in you, sir, to lhold ul) to our
view as " perfectly wise and virtuous," the character
and conduct of one who seiems to hlave been possessed(t
witli an incutrable antipathy to all that is called religion; and who strained every nerve, to explode, suppress, and extirpate the spirit of it among men, and
that its very nanne mighlt no more be lhad in rememn-.84HORNE'S LETTERS, &amp;c.
brance? Are we, do you imagine, to be reconciled to
a character of this sort, gnd Pall in love with it, because its owner was good company, and knew lhow-to
manage hlis ca'rds? Low as tile age is fallen, I will
venture to hope, it has grace enoughl yet left to resent suchi usage as this.
You endeavour to entertain us with some pleasant
conceits that were supposed lby Mr. Hume to pass
between himiself and Cl aron.'ihe philosopher tells
thie old gentleman, that, i, e had been endeavouring to open the eyes of tlie public; that he was correcting his works for a niew edlition," from which
great things were to be expected; in shlort, "if lie
could(l but live a few years longer, (and that was the
only reason why lie would wish to do so,) he minght
have the satisfaction of seeing the downfatll of some
of the prevailing systems of superstition."
We all know, sir, what the word Superstition dentotes, in Mr. Hlume's voeabu,lary, aind against what
Religion h-is slhafts are levell(ed, under that name.
But, doctor Smith. do you believe, or wouldy ou have
its believe, thlat it is Charon, wlho calls us out or' the
world, at the appointed lime? Does ot HEr call ius
out of it, who sent us into it? Let me, then, present
you with a l)araphriase of the wishl, as addr essed to
HIM, to wlhom  it should. and to whomn alone, with
any sense anti propriety, it can be addressed. Thus
it runs: " Lord! I have only one reason why I
should wish to live. Suffer mne so to do, I most humbly beseech tlice, yet a little while~ till mine eyes
shall behold the success of my undertaking, to overthlrow, by mny metaphysics, thte faith which thly SoN
descended from lHeaven to plant, and toroot out the
knowledge and the love of thee froom the earth.'"'
Here are no rhetorical figures, no hItperboles, nor
exaggerations. The matter is even so. I appeal,
in thie face of the world, sir, to yourself, and to every
man, wlho can read and understand the writimrgs of
-S,  5
185HORNE'S LETTERS, &amp;e,
ther."  Now, sir, if you will only give me leave to
ju(lge, befiwe dinner, of Mr. Humne's philosol)lly, as he
tijudged of it after dinner, we sliall have no farther dispute upon that subject. I coul(l indeed wish, to hlave
a schleme of thoiughit, whichi would bear contemplating,
at any time of thie (lay; because, otherwise, a person
must be at tlhe expense of mnaintainingt a brace of thlese
metaphysical hobby-llorses, one to mount in the morniig, and the other in the afternoon.
After all, siir, friend as I am to freeldom of opinlion,
(and ino one living' can be more so,) I aim ratlher sorry
that men should judge so variously of Mr. Hume's
phiilosophical speculations. For since tlie design o'f
themi is to banishi ouit of thie world every idea of truthi
and comnfort, salvation and iimmortality, a fututre
state, and the provi(ldence and even the existence of
GoD, it seems a pity, tlhat we cannot all be of a mind
about them. And 1 coutild have been well pleased to
have been iniformeed by you, sir, that, before hliis death,
lie had ceased to number among his happy effusions,
tracts of thtis kind and tendenicy.
Let mie conme a little closer to yotu, doctor, if you
plea.e, upon this subject. Do not be tinder any apprehensionis: my name does not begin wvithl a B. Are
yolt sure, ant(! cain you mako us sure, that there really
exist no suilch things as a GOD, an(d a future state of
rewards andt punishments? If so, all is well.  Let is
then, in outir last hiutrs, read Lucian, and lplay at whiist,
and droll upon Charon and hlis boat; let us {lie as
foolish andt insensible, as much like our brothier p'-ilosophers, tile calves of thle field, and llhe asses of the
desert, as we ca.  Butit, if suchi thlings are, as thley
certainly are, is it riglht in you, sir, to hlold upl) to our
view as, perfectly wise antl vi'tuous," the chlaracter
and condutict of one who seems to have been possessed(

Perhaips our modern sceptics are ignorant, that

insupportalble. But ean I sulpl)ose themi in a state
of total and invincible stupidity. utter strangers to
the human hleart, and( to hutnan affairs? Sllurely
they would not thank me for such a slpposition.
Yet this I  ilmust siuppose, or I milttst )believe tlheIn to,

profligate of men. Caressed by thllose Wlo call thletselves the great, engrossed by the formalities of lile

and little relish for- the consolationts of religion.
Butt let them know, that in the solitary seenes of

friends never durst mention before him, andi warne(1 all
strangers, who were introduced to hilm, against doing
it, because he never failed, when by any accident it
was done, to fly into a transport of passion and swearing? Was it deemed necessary, or expedient, on this
account, that he should represent himself, and that you
shlould represent him, perfectly secure of th-le growth
and increase of his philosophic reputationll, as if no book
had been written, which had impaired it; judging it
muchl easier to dissemble the fall of Dagon, tlhan to

anohther to.justify and recotmlnend ", self- muider."
Upon the whqole, dloctor, 1I think you will not succeed this timne. You would( persuade us,.y the example of David Hume, esq. th-at atheism is the only cor(dial for low spiriti, and the proper aiitidote against
the fear of death. But, suLrely, hle who can reflect,

Withi a hecart almost broken withgi&gt;
Iam going, I fear, to trouble youi by pouiring it -OwlThi
Ihave lost m-y fattier,m  best friend, anm,1; evet,: th1thiat was most valuable to ince in the worldi!

piercing criei,s that were uttered,-Butt w,hat dlo I say?
God forbid that yortner, your most afcint
hieart, -should have been a witness of thte scene!1
The ivc-iter of this letter was an elegant anid accomplished'youing lady of ~the first,distinctioni in Iveland, who had not cornpk!~ted heri. seventeen'th y7ear a-t the time of her father's -de-ath.
191.192        HORNE'S LETTERS, &amp;C
I was hlardly able to bear the thoughts of survivilng
hirm: but, thank God, I anm in some degree composed~
I most earnestly repent of mny sin, ill forgetting for a
moment that from His hand I receive good, and wlhy
not evil when hle thinks fit?
Pray, sir, pardon the liberty I have taken in
writinig to you; bibut allow me to apologize in some.measure, by telling you, that the day before my dearest father grew ill, he desired me to write; as, you
may remember, hle owed you a letter., P-erhaps,":said he smiling, " it will please the dear doctor."
You will, no doubt, wonder what could take him off
so suddenly. It was a disorder in the brain; nIot water, but somethling occasioned by a fulness in thte head.
He died on the sixth day after he was seized. The
day he was first affected, hle came down to breakfast;
but, alas! he had totally lost his senses. Think what
I must have felt! The physicians all agreed, and
thoughit till the very last, that his bodily ailments
were not fatal, but that his understanding was gone
for ever. Was it not a blessing then that God did not
ordain him to outlive himself? I have been since thinkinrg that I was permitted to see him in that most melancholy state, to fill miy heart with this subject of thiankfulness.
And let me cast my tlhouights on that most amazing
and blessed change hle has undergone, fromn a world of
pains and vexations at best, to join that blessed spirit,
miy dearest mother, and make one of the angelic clhoir
that cease not, day and( nighit, to sing halleilujahs.
How this idea transports me fromt the world! God
grant it may influence lily life; t-hat, when I comle to
die, it may be the deathl of the righteous, whiichl is olly
to be attained by living their litfe!
Will you be so kind as to present my nmost affection,
ate respects to Mrs. Horne and your daugliters? Yor
will break these most dismal tidings to thcim; I am
sure tihey w-ill sympatihise in my affliction.H ORNE'S LETTERS, &amp;c,  
I flatter myself that you will favour me withl a line.
Whlat consolation must flow from your pen! And stffer me to assure you, that, iext to the dear parent wlho
is laid in the dust, 1- have reverenced, loved, and honoured you. If you can pardon me for tlhus troubling
you, ani(l you should: wish to hlear now anld tlhenji how
the mourners at       go on, I shlall hlave muchi pleasure in letting you know.
My poor brothler is most deeply afflicted. My happiness must now, in a great measure, rest upon his
good conduct; and I think he will not disappoint me:
tlius, as one prop is withdrawn, the heart of mian fondly clings to anothei'r.
Mrs. -    is getting much better. Ever-since we
came hlome this year, we have been in daily expectation of hler decease. Wilat an amazement it is to her
to find herself alive, sulrvivinlg my fathler! She bears
it like a Chlristian; and says, she needs not take hler
leave so soon to follow.
Farewell, most honoured sir! Believe me
Your most duttifuil, most afflicted servant.

and support them in time and eternity.
You ask comfort of, me: but yotur truly excellent
letter has suggested comIfort to me, from all the proper topics; anid 1 can only reflect it back to you. All
things considered, the circumstance which first marked the disorder may be ternmed( a gracious (lispensatioin.
It at once rendered the event, one may say, desirable,
whlich other wise carried, in the face of it, so much terror and sorrow. Nothing else in tlhe world could so

the fact, Mr.      stood always so prepared, so
firmt in his faith, so constant in his Christian practice
of every duty, that he could not be taken by surprise,
or off his guard: the stroke must be to himself a blessing, whenever, or however, it came. His death was
his birthday; and, like the primitive Christians, we
should( keep it as suchl, as a day of joy and triumph.
Bury his body; butt embalm his example, and let it
diffuse its firagrance among you from generation to

September 2,5 i70.
Dear sir,
You hlave, as I find by every kind of evi~
dence, lost an excellent mother; and I hope you will
not think mne incapable of partakinig of your grief. I
have a mnother now eighty two years of age; whom,
thlerefore, I must soon lose, unless it please God that
she ratlher should moutrn for me. I read tihe letters inr
whichi you relate your mother's death to Mrs. Stralhan; and thlink 1 do myself honour when I tell you that
Iread thlem with tears btut tears are neithlier to you
nor to me of any fartlher use, when the t.ibute of nature has been paid. rIThe buisiness of life summnons us
away fronm -useless g'rief, and cails us to the exercise o'
thl-ose virttues of whiclh we are lamenting our deprivationi. m'Ite greatest benefit whiicl-h one friend can confer upon another, is to guard, acnd excite, and elevate
h'is virtues. rThis, y(tour' m-nothter will still perf)rm, ir
you diligently preserve the memory of her life, and o-f
her deathi: a life, so far as I can learn, usefutl and
wise;and a deathl resigned peaceful, and hloly. I cannot forbear to mention, that neither reason nor revelation denies you to hope, that you may increase her
happiness by obeying her precepts; and that she may,
in her present state, look wVitlh pleasure upon every
act of virtue to whichl her instructionis or example have
contributed.  Whether this is more than a pleasing
dream, or a just opinion of separate spirits, is, indeed96~ JOHNSON'S LETTERS.
of no great importance to us, whlen we conisider ourselves as acting ulnder the eye of God: yet surely
there is something pleasing in the belief, that our separation from those whlom we love is merely corporeal.
There is one expedient, by whlich y(u may, in some
degree, continue your mothler's presenlce. If you wvrite
down miinutely what you remember of her from your
earliest years, you will read it withl great pleastre,
and receive from it many hints of soothling recollection,
when time shall remove hler yet farther fiomn you, aInd
your grief shall be mnatured to veneration. rjo this,
however painful for the present, I cannot but advise
you, as to a source of comfort a(nd satisfaction in tlhe
time to come: for all comfort and all satisfactionI are
sincerely wished you by, dear sir,
Your most obliged,
And most obedient servrant,

January 9,.758o
Dearest siP,
I minust have indeed slept very fast, not
to lave beelln awakened by yotur letter. None of your
suspicions are true: I am not nuch li rilcher than
when you left ime; and, what is worse, mry otlissiot
of an answer to your. fitrst letter, vill prove that I am
not much wiser. Buit I go ont as I formerly did, dce
signing to be some timtre or othler both rich and wise.
Do you take notice of my example, and learn the
danger of delay. Whlen I was as you are now, towcring in confidenlce of twenty one, little did I suspect
that I should be at forly nine, what I now am.
But you do not seem to need my admonition. You
are busy in acquiring and in communicating knowledge; and while you are stud(lying, enjoy the enid of
study, by making othlers wiser and happier. I was
much pleased withl the tale thtat you told me of your
being tutor to your sisters. I, who have no brothers
nor sisters, look with somie degree of envy on those
vwho may be said to be born to friends; and I cannot
see, without wonder, lhow rarely that native unioni
is afterwards regarded. It somnetimnes, indeed, happens, that some supervenient cause of discord may
overpower this original aii ity; but it seems to me
more frequently tlhrown away witlh levity, or lost by
negligence, thian destroyed by.ipjury or violence.
We tell the la(dies that good wives make good
husbands; I believe it is a  i'more indubitable position
that good( brothers takae good sisters.
I amt satisfied with your stay at home, as Juvenal
was with his friend's r-etirementt to (UmWe: I know

You reproachl me very often with parsimony

mny plaper, that I design to recompense rarity by
length. A short letter to a distant friend is, in my

By conducting Mr. Soulthwell to Yenicee, you fulfilled, I know, the original contract: yet I would
wish you not wholly to lose him from your notice,
buit to recommend himn to such acquaintance as may
best secure him from suffering by his own follies,
and to take such general care both of his safety and
his interest as may come within youtir power. Hlis
relations will thank you for any suclh gratuitous attention: at least, they will not blame you for any
evil that mnay happen, whether they thankl you or
not for any good.
T'he artists have instituted a yearly exhibition of
pictures and statues, in imitation, as I anm told, of
ftbreign Academies. This year was the second exhibition. They please themnselves mnuch with the multitude of spe'eetatos, and imnagine tlhat tthe English

I know my Baretti will not be satisfied with a letter in which I give him no account of myself: yet
what account shall I give him? I have not, since
the day of our separation, suffered or done any thing
considerable. I have hithlerto lived without the con.
currenee of my own judgment; yet I continue to
flatter myself, that, when you return, you will find
me mnended.
I hope you take care to keep an exactjournal, and
to register all occurrences and observations. You
have given us good speeimnens in your letters from
Lisbon. I wish you had staid longer in Spain, for no

LETTER V.
To Dr. (aflcrwards sir George) S'antto'n.
June 1, 76G.
Dear sir.,
I make haste to rmnswer your kind letter,
in hlope of hearing again from you before you leave
us. I cannot but regret that a man of your qualifications should( find it necessary to seek an establisthnment in Gu adaloupe. If a peace slhoutld restor-e that
island to the Frene l, I shlall thlinki it somine alleviation
of the loss, that it mIust likewise restore Dr. Stlaunton to the English.
It is a tmelancholy consideration, that so muchl of
our time is necessarily to be spent upon the care of
living, -and that we can seldom obtain ease in one respect but by resigning it in another; yet I suppose
we are by this dispensation not less happy on tlhe
wvhole, than it' the spontaneoIus bouinty of Nature
poured into our hand(s all that we want.  A few, if
they were left thlius to themselves, would, perhaps,
spend their time in laudable pursuits; hut the greater part would prey upon the quiet of each othier,
or, in the want of other ob'eets, would prey upon
themselves,
202JOHNSON'S LETTERS.                o03
this, hlowever, is our condition, which we must
improve and solace as we can: and though we cannot always choose our place of residence, we may, in
every place, find rational amusemnents, and possess5
in every place, the comforts of piety antid a pure conscience.
The new world must have many vegetables and
animals;with which philosoplhers are but little acqua-iiited. I hope you will furnishl yourself wvithl
some books of natural history, and some glasses and
othler instruments of observation. Trust as little as
possible to report; examnine all you can by your own
senses. I do not doubt but yotu will be able to add
much to knowledge, and, perhaps, to medicine.
Wild nations trust to simples; and, perhaps, the
Peruvian bark is not the only specific which those
extensive regions may afolrd us.
Wherever you are, and whatever may be your fortune, be certain, dear sir, that you carry with you
my kind wishes; and that whether you return hither, or stay in the othler hemisphere, to hear that
you are happy will give l)leasure to
Your most affectionate, humble servant,

LEFTTER VI.
To Mlr. Baretti.
London, July 20, t762~
Sir,
Howeverxjustly you may accuse me for
want of punctuality in correspondence, 1 am not so
far lost in negligence, as to omit the opportunity af
wviting to you, which Mr. Beauclerk's passage
thlroug h Milan affords me.JOHNSON'S LETTERS.
As you have now been long away; I suppose your
curiosity mnay pant for some news of your old( friends.
Miss Williams and I live much as we did. MAliss Cotterell still continues to cling to Mrs. Porter. Mr.
Reynolds gets six thousand a year. Levet is lately
married, not without mtuch suspicion that he has
b)een wretchedly cheated in his match. Mr. Ghamhers is gonte, for the first time, tihe circuit with the
judges. Mr. Richardsoh's second daughter has marrie(l a merchant.
MAly vanity, or my kindness, makes me flatter my
self, that you Would rather hear of me than of those
whom 1 have mentioned; but of myself I -lhave very
little which I care to tell. Last winter I went 4own
to my native town, where I found the streets mnuch
narrower and shorter than I thlought I had left thlem,
inhabited by a new race of people, to whom I was ve.
ry little known. My play-fellows were grown old,
and forced mie to suspect, that I was no longer young.
My only remaining friend has changed his principles,
and hlas become the tool of the predominiant faction.,
My daughter-in-law, from whom I expected most,
an(i whom I met with sincere benevolence, has lost
the beauty and gaiety of youth, without having
gained much of the wisdomn of age. I wandered
about for five d(lays, alnd took the first convenient
opportunity of returning to a place, where, if there
is not much happiness, there is, at least, such a diversity of good and evil, that slight vexations do not
fix upon the heart.
I thlink in a few weeks to try anothler excursion;
thoiugh to vwhat end? Let Ine know, my Baretti,
what has been the result of your return to your own
coluntry; whether time has made any alteration for
the better! and whlether, when the first raptures of
salutation were over, you did not find your thoughts
confessed their disappointment.
g0o,JOHNSON'S LETTERS.
Moral sentences appear ostentatious and tumid,
when they have no greater occasions than the journey of a wit to his native town: yet such pleasu-res
and stuchl pains make up the general mass of life;
and as nothing is little to him whlo feels it with great
sensibility, a mind able to see common incidents in
their real state is disposed by very commono incidents
to very serious contemplations. Let us trust that a
time will come, whlen the present moment shall be
no longer irksome; when we shall not borrow all
our happiness from hope, wlicieh at last is to end in
disappointment.
1 beg that you will show Mr. Beauclerk all the eivilities which you have in your power i for lhe has
always been kind to me.
May you, my Baretti, be very happy at Milan, or
at somte other place nearer to
Your most affectionate, humble servant

You are not to sup pose, with all your con.

pointment, withl whlichl you seemn more toliuchied than I
shiould expect a mana  of youtr resolution and experience to be, di( I nriot kllow thlat general ttruths are
seldom app)lied to particular occasioins; and that the
fallacy of otur self-love extendis itsellt' as w\ide as otr intterest or affections. Every man believesthat patrons
are capricious; but he excepts his own patrol'n. We
have all learned tlhat greatniess is negligenlit and con~
temDptuous, and that, in courts, life is often languislhed
away in ungratified expectation; but he who approaches greatness, or glitters in a court, imagines that destiny has exempted himi from the commlon lot.
Do not let suchl evils overwhlielm you, as tlhousanlds
have suffered, and thousands have surmounted: but
turn your tlhoughlts with vigour to somre otlher plan of
life; atnd keep always in your mind, tlhat, with due subnit.ssion to Providence, a mant of genius has seldom
b)een ruined but by himself. Your patronl's weakness
or insensibility will finally do you little hurt, if he is
not assisted by your own passions.
Of yolur love I know not thle propriety, nor can -I
estimate the power; btit in love, as in every othler

To Jfames Boswell, esq. at Utrecht.
London, Dec. 8, 17635
Dear sir,
You are notto think yourself forgotten, or
neglected, that you hlave had yet no letter from me. I
ltve to see my friends, to hear fiom them, to talk to
themi, and to talk of them; but it is not witliout a consilderable effort of resolution that I prevail uponl myself to write.  I would not, h1owever'. grati~y iny owi
in.lolence lby the omission of any imp)or-tant duity, or
any office of real kinulness. I'The topics with wlhich
tihose letters are commonl v filled, that are written only for tihe sake of wiiting, I seldom shiall think wortht
communicating; but if I can lhave it in my power, to
calm anry harassing disquiet, to excite any virtluous
desire to rectify any important opinion, or fortify
any generous resoluition, you need not dotubt but I sihall
at least wish to prefer tl-he- pleasuire of gratifying a
friiend much less esteemed than yourself, before the
gloomy calmn of idle vacancy. Whlethier I shiall easily arrive at an exact punictuiality of correspondence, I
cannot tell.
Yout will, perhaps, wish to ask, what study I wouldl
recommend. I shallnot speak of theology, because it
oughit not to be considered as a question wliether you
shall eindeavour to kinow the will of God.
2072JOHNSONIS LETTERS.
I shall, thlerefore, consider only suchl studies as we
are at liberty to pursute or to neglect; and of these I
know not hIow you will make a better chloice, than by
studying the civil law, as youtr father advises, and the
ancient languages, as you hlad determined for your-.self. Resolve, while you remain in any settled resi
dence, to spen(l a certain number of hours every d(lay
amongst your books.'lihe dissipation of thought, of
whichl you complain, is nothing more t-ha, the vacillation of a mind suspe(nded between d(lifferent motives,
and changing its direction as any motive gainis or
loses strength. If you can buit kindle in yotur mind
any strong desire, if you can but keep pre(lominant
any wish for some particular excellence or attaiinment,
the gusts of imagination will break away, withlout
any effect upon your conduict, and coinimonly witlhout
any traces left u-ponI youir memnory.
Thilere lurtks, perhaps, in every huiman heart a desire of distinctlion, which inclines every man first to
hope, aind then to belicve, that Nature has given himn
something peculiar to himself. Thtis vanity makes
one min(l nurse aversions, and anothler actuate desires,
till they rise by art much above tlheir original state of
power; and as affectation, in time, improves to habit,
they at last tyramnise over him wlho, at fir st, encouraged tthemn only for shiow.''lThey are, like the viper in
the; bosom, wtho, while hle was ciill, wvas harmless; but.when warmth gave him stren_gtht, exerted it in poison.
Youl know a gentlemAan, who, Wleill first he set his foot
in the gay wold1, as hie preparetd himself to whirl in the
-vortex of pleasure, imagined a total i(lifflerence a(nd a
-niversal negligence to be thle most agreeable concomitants of youth, and the strongest indication of an airy
temper and a quick applehlension.'caat to every
object, andi sensible otl' every imputIse, he thoughit thIat
all appearance of diligence would deduct somtnethiling
famn thle reputiation or' genitas; and hloped tlhat he
should appear to attain, alnidst all theease of carelessness, and all the ttiumutilt of diversion, that knowledge,~08JOHNSON'S LETTERS.
and lthose accomi)lishlments, whichl mortals of thlle coma
mnon fabric obtain only by muite abstraction and solitary drudgery. He tried the sclheme of life awhile;
and hle was mnade weary of it by his sense and hlis virtuLe. He then wished to return to hIis studies: but
finding long habits of idleness and l)leasure hlardler to
be cutred tlian hle expected, and still willing to retain
his claim to some extraordinary prerogatives, hle resolve(l thle cotmmon consequenices of irregularity into
an unalterable degree of destiny, ant concluded that
Nature 1-had origi nally formred him incapable of ration-,
al employmuelnt.
Let all such fancies, illusive and destructive, be banishel, liencceforward from your thoughts. Resolve,
and, keep your resoluttion; clhoose, and( pursue your
choice. If you spend this day in study, yout will find
yourself still more able to study to-motrrow; not that
you are to expect that you shall at once obtain a comn
plete victory. Depravity is not very easily overcomie.
i{csolution will somtetim-es relax  and dliigence wi1
sometimnes be interrupted; butt let no accid&amp;-ntal surprise or deviation, whether short or lo,-g, dispose yoe
to desponIdency. Consider tlhese ftiluigs as incident
to all mankind, Begin again wlere yout left off; aLid
enleavour to avoid the sedicemenlts that prevailed
over you before.
This, miy dear Boswell, is advice wlich, perhaps,
has been often given yotu, antd given you witlhout effect. Butt this advice, if you will not take fromt othlers,
you rmust take fraom your own reflections, if you purpose to do the (dtites of the station to whiichL the bounty of Providence has called you.
Let me lhavre a long letter fiom you as soon as you

Not less than the tenthl part of his income was set apart for charity. He was very considerate to h's servants; hle explained his injunctjons to thlem distinctly; and, at their first coming into his
service, steadily exacted a close and unrlemitting compliance with
his rules: the servants finding this to be the case, sootn grew habitually accustomred to their: business; and then very little further attention was necessary. On extraorcdinary intstainces of goocl
behaviour, or diligent service, he was not wanting in particular
encouragements, and presents above their wages; acnd it is remarkable that he woutld permit tlheir relations to visit thlem, and
stay at his house two or three days at a time. Evervy Monday

wvith a computation he hlad made, how much that inconcne would
aflbord him every week and day of the year. One of his economnical practices was. as soon as any repair was wanting in or about
his house, to have it immediately performed. When lie hlad

times with the utmost exactness. He gave notice to the tradesmen of the neighbouring towns that they slihould no longer have

Sir,
I did not expect to hear that it could be, in an
assembly convened for the propagation of Christian
kinoledge, a question w!hether any nation uninstrt.cted inr religion sihoul(l receive instruction; or w-ether
tlhat instruction should be imparted to them by a translation (of the Hloly Books into their own language.* If
obedience to the will of God be necessary to hllappiness,
and knowledge of hlis will be necessary to obedience, I
k,iow not how he whIo withholds this knowledge, or tdelays it, can be said( to love his neighbour as himseif.
Hle, wlio voluntarily continues ignorant, is guilty of all
tile crimes which. ignorance procduces  as to him wiho
should extinguishi the tapers of a lighthouse, might
justly be imputed the calamnities of shlipwrecks. Ctrhistianity is tie perfection of lhumanity; aind as no tman
is good but as he wishes the good of otihers, no mai
can be good in the hlighlest degree, who wishlles not to
othiers the largest mesure of thlie-greatest goo(d.
I am not very willing that any language should be
totally extinguished. The similitud(le and derivation
of language.s afford the most indubitable p)roof of thte
tradluction of nations, an(l the genealogy of mankind.'I'lhey often add physical certaintyto historical evidence; and often supply the only evidence of ancient
migrations, and of the revolutions of ages whichl left
no written monuments behind them.
Every mana's opinions, at least his-desires, are a lit.
tie inftlenced by his favorite stutdies. My zeal for lanSome of the members of the society in Scotland for propagating Christian knowledge, had opposed the scheme of translating the Holy Scriptutires into the Erse or Gaelic language, from
political considerations of the disadvantage of keeping up the
distinction between the Hlighlanders and the other inhabitants
of North Britain,0 JOTINSON'S LETTERS.
guages may seem perhalps, rather overheated, even to
those by whlom I desire to be well esteemed. To tlhose
who hlave ntothling in their thoughts buit trade or
policy, present power, or present monlley, I should
not tthink it necessary to defend my opinlionlls: but
with mllen of letters I would not unwillingly compounid, by wishing the continutance of every language,
however narrow   in its extent, or however incomr
ronodious for common purposes, till it is reposited
in some version of a known book, that it may be
always hereafter examnlined and compared with othler
languages; and thlen permitting its disuse. For this
purpose, the translation of the Bible is muchl to be desired. It is not certain that the samte miethod Will not
preserve the Highland lan,gutag., for the purpose of
learnintg, an(l abolisit it fromt daily use. When thle
High,lan(lers once deosire to learn9 tlhey will natutrally
have recourse to t}he nearest langtiage by whlich that
desire can be gratified; and one will tell another that
if lhe would attain knowledge, hle must learn oLnglish.
This stpeculation may, perhliaps, he thought more
sullbtle thanl thte grossness of real life will easily admit.
Let it, hWivever, be remembered, th6t the efficacy of
ignorance has long been tried, tnd it -has not pro(luced the coniseq(uellce exlfecte(l. Let knowledlge, titerefore take its turn; and let the patrons of privation
stan(l awlhile aside, and atdinit the operation of positive principles.

Oxford, April 18, 1768,
My dear madamn
You- have had a very great loss.To lose an old fiienti, is to becut off from a great part
of tihe little pleasure that this life allows. Bu t such is
tile coinditionr of oiur nature, that as we live on we must
see th-ose whom wve love dro)p successively, and find
our circle of relatioii grow less and less, until we are
almost unconnected with the wor(ld; and tlhen it mnust
soon be our turn to (Irop into the grave.'There is
also this consolation, that we lave one Protector wlho
can ntever be lost but by our own fault; and every new
experienice of tle uncertainty of all othier comiforts
should deterillille lus to fix our hearts where true joys
are to be foLund. All unlion with- the ilnhabitants of
earth miust in time be broken; and( all the lhopes that
terminate here, must, on one part or other, end inl
disappointment.
When I return to London, I will take care of your
reading-gl:-ss. Whlenever I can do army thiing for you,
remember, my dear, that one of my greatest pleasures
is to please you.
The punictuality of your correspondence I consider
as a proof of great regard.  Whien we shall see eaclh

LETTER XIII.
To Jamnes Boswell, Esq.
Dear Sir,
I am ashamed( to think that since I received your letter, I hlave passed so many days without answering it.'I'here seems no great difficulty in resolving your
doubts. T'le reasons f6r whilch you are, inclined to
visit London, are, I thliink, not of sufficient strength
to answver the objections. rlhat you should delight
to come once a year to the fountain of intelligence
and pleasure, is very natural; but the desire both of
information and( pleasure, must be regulated by propriety. Pleasure, which cannot be obtained but by
unreasonal)le or unsuitable expense9 must always end
in pain: and pleasure, which must be enjoyed at the
expence of another's pain, can never be such as a
worthy mind can fully delight in. WVhat improvement you might gain by coining to London, you
may easily supply, or easily compensate, by enjoining yourself some particular study at home, or opening somte new avenue to informnation. Ediinburgh is
not yet exhausted; and I am sure you will find no
pleasure here which can deserve either that yout
shiould anticipate any part of your future fortune, or
that you should condemn yourself and your lady to
penurious frugality for the rest of the ye-;r-.
I need not tell yout what regard ou owe to Mrs.
13Boswvll's entreaties; or how much,you ought to
study the happiness of her, who studies yours with
so muchl diligence, and of whose kindtness you enjoy
so good effects. Life cannot subsist in society but by
reciprocal concessions. She permitted you to ramr
bie last year, yoI mIust permuit her now to keep you
at homie.
Your last reasson is so serious, that I am unwilling
to oppose it. Yet you must remember, that yourJOHNSON'S LE'TERS,ElS
Image of worshliping once a year in a certain place,
in imitation of the Jews, is but a comparison, and
di simile non est idem."  If the annual resort to

Mrs. Williams, whomi you may reckon as one of
your well wishers, is in a feeble and languishling state.
She went for some part of the autemn into the country, but she&amp;is little benefited; and Dr. Lawrence confesses that his art is at an end. I am sorry for her
pain, and more sorry for her decay.
I was some weeks this autumn at Brighlthelmston1.
The place was very dull, an(l I was not well; the expedition to the Hebrides was tlie most pleasant journey
that I ever made. Suchl an effort annually would give
the world a little diversity.
Every year, hlowever, we cannot wanider; and we
must, therefore, endeavtour to spend our time at home
as well as we can. I believe it is best to throw life irto a method, that every hour may bring its employment, and every eimployment have its hour. Xenophon
observes, in lhis " Treatise of Economy," that if every thling is kept in a certain place, when any thing is
worn out or consumed, the vacuity whlich it leaves will
show what is wanting; so, if every part of time has its
duty, the hour will call into remembrance its proper engagemnent.
I have not practised all this prudence myself, but I
have suffered much for want of it; antd I Woul(l lhave
you, by timely recollection alnd stea(y resolution, escape from those evils whlich have laint heavy uxpon me.

LETTER XVII.
To a young Clergyman in the counttry.
Bolt Court Aug. 30, 1788Dear sir,
Not many dlays ago 1Dr. Lawrence showed
me a letter, in wlich you make kind miention of me: I
hopc, therefore, you vill not be displeased tlhat I eni
deavour to preserve your good will by a few observa,
tions -whiclh your letter suggested to me.
Yoi are afraid of falling into some improprieties in
the dcaily service, by reading to an audience that re(Luires 1no exactness. Your fear, I hopl)e, secures you
frm (N danger. Tihey who contract absurd habits, are
sucih as hJave no fear. It is impossible to do thie same
thinlg very often, without some peculiarity of manner:
but that maznner lay be good or bad, and a little care
will at least preserve it from being bad; to make it
very good, thlere must, I thlink, be sometling of natural or casual felicity, which cannot be taught.
Your present miethod of miakinig your serimons seems
very judicioius. Few frequent preachers can be supiosed to have sermons more their own than yours will
be. TI'ake care to register, somewhere or other, the
autlhors from whom your sevreral discourses are bor.
rowed; and do not imagine that you shlall always remember even whlat perhaps yotu now think it impossible to forget.
My advice hlowever is, that you attempt, from time
to time, an original sermon; and, in the labour of cow.JOHNSON'S LETTERS.

cogitation, propriety of thoughlt and elegance of expression. I nvent first, and tlhen emibellislh. TVlje productiov of somlething, whlere notlhing was before, is an
act of greater energy than the expansion or decoration of the thing produiced. Set downv diligently your
thoughlts as they rise, in the first wor(ls tlhat occur;
aand.wihen you hlave matter you will easily give it
form:n  nor, perhiaps, will thils method be always necessary, for, by hliabit, your thougilts and diction will
flow t(ogether.
ThIe composition of sermons is not very difficult:
the divisions not only help tihe memiory of thie hearer,
but direct the judgmenlt of the writer; tliey supply
sources of invention, and( keep every part in its proper place.
Whlat I like least in your letter is your account of
the manners- of your parishl; fiom whlhich I gatlher,
that it hlas been long neglected by the patson.'r1Tl1e
d(lean of Carlisle, wlhen lie was a little rector in Northamptonshlire, told me, that it might be dliscerne(l
whethler or not thlere was a clergyman resid(lent in a
parishl, by the civil or savage manners of the people.
Suclh a congregation as yours stand in much rieed of
reformation; and I would not have you think it impossible to reform thiem. A very savage parish was
civilized by a decayed( gentlewoman, wtio went thlithler
to teach a petty school. My learned friend, Dr.
Wheeler, of Oxford, when he was a youting man, had tlhe
careof aneighbouring )arish forfifteen pound(s a year,
whlichl he was never paid; but he couinted it an advantage that it compelled him to mnake a sermon weekly.
One womnan he could not brinig to the commiunion;  
and, wvhen lie reproved or exhorted her, she only an.
swered that she was no scholar. He was ad(lvise(d to
set somne good womian or man of tihe parish, alittle wviser than lherself, to talk to her in a language level to
her mind. Such honestl(I may call themn holy) arti2l'JOHNSON'S LETTERS.i               2~

means must be tried by which souls mnay be saved.
r'ialk to your people, however, as much as youti can;  
and you will find that thle more freqtuently you con
verse with them upon religious subjects, thte more wil
lingly they will attend, and the more submissively
they will learn. A clergyman's diligence always
makes lhim venerable.

Dearest madanm,
Of your injunctions, to pray for you
and write to you, I hope to leave neither unobserved.
I am not without my part df the calamity. NO death
since that of my wife, has eVer oppressed me like this.
But let us remember, that We are in the handfs of HIi
who knows when to give, and when to take away: who
will look upon us, with mnercy, thlrough all our variationis of existence; and who invites us to call upon him
in the day of trouble. Call upon HIM in this great revolutiort of life, and call with confidence. You will
then fiid comfort for the past, and support for the fuiture. HE who has given you happiness in marriage,
to a degree, of whlich, withouit personal knowledge, I
should hlave thotughlt the description fabulouts, can give
you anothler mode of happiness, as a mother; and at
last, the happiness of losing all temiporal cares in the
ttioughlts of an eternity in Heaven.JOHNSON'S LETTERS.
I do not exhort you to reasoni yoturself into tran
quillity. We must first pray, and thlen labour; first
inplore the blessing of God, and then use those means..which he puts into ouir hands. Cultivated ground hIas
few weeds: a mind occupied by lawfuil bLusiness, has
little room for useless regret.
We read the will to-day: but I will not fill my first
letter with any othler account thlami thlat, with all my
zeal for your advantage, I am satistied; and that tihe
other executors, more used to consider property thana
I, coimmended it for wisdom and equity. Yet why
should I not tell you that you have five hundred
pounds for your inimme(liate expenses, and two thousand pounds a year, with both the houses, and all tlhe
goods?
Let us pray for one anotlher, that the timer whether
long or short, tlhat shall yet be granted us, may lbe
well spent; and that when this life, wlhichl at the longest is very shiort, shall colme to an end, a better may

Dear sir,
The pleasure which we used to receive fromn
each other on Good-Friday and Easter-day, wve must

The earnestness and tenderness of your letter are such, that I cannot thlink myself showing it
more respect th-an it claims, by sitting down to answer
it on the (lay on whichl I received it.
This year hlas afflicted me withl a very irksome and
severe disorder. MAy respiration has been muchl impeded, ani(d much blood( has been taken away. I am

To James Boszvell, csq.
London, Sept. 7, 1782.
Dear sir,
I have struggled tiroughl this year wvith so
muchl infirmity of b(ody, and so strong imI)rcssions of
tle- fraagility of life, tl-hat I cannot hear, without emotion, of the removal of any oeic, wlomn I have known,
into anothier state.
Your fatlher's deathl had every circumstance that
could enable you to bear it: for it wvas at a matureage, and it was expected; and, as. Ilis general
life hlad been pious, his thoughts had doubtless for many years past been turned upon eternity. Tllat you
did not find him sensible must grieve you. His disposition towards you was--undoubl)tedly that of a kind,
thlough not of a folnd father. Kindness, at least actual,
is inl our power butlt f(dnnesas is niot; and, if by negJOHNSON'S LETTERS.
ligence or imnprudence, you had(l extinguished his
tondness, he could not, at wvill, rekindle it. Nothing
i hen lremainied between you, but mutual forgiveness of
4each othler's faults, aiid mutual desire of each otlher'sl
happiness.
I shall long to know lhis final disposition of his fort'une.
You, d(lear sir, hlave now a new station; and have,
tlhereforIe, nlew cares, and new employments. Life, as
Cowley seems to say, oughit to reselible a well ordered
poem; of which one ruile generally received is, that
the exordiumn shoulld be simiple, and slIoulld promise
little.  Begin your new course of life with tihe least
show and the least expense possible; you m-nay at pleasure increase bothl, but you cannot easily diminish
them. Do not think your estate your own, while any
nman can call uponryou for money which you cannot pay;
thierefore, begin witlh timorous parsimony. Let it be
your first care not to be in any man's debt.
When thte tliloutghts are extended to a fituire state,
the present life seems hardly worthy of all those principles of conduct, an(l maxims of prudence, which one
generation of men has transmitted to another: buit upon a closer view, when it is perceived how much evil
is produiced, and how much good is impeded, I)y emnbarrassmenit and distress, and how little room the expedients of poverty leave for tile exercise of virtue; it
is manlifest that tile boundless importance of tile next
life, enforces some attention to the interests of thlis.
Be kind to tile old( servants, and secutire tie goodl will
of thie agents an(l factors; do not disgust themi by asperity, or unwelcomne gaiety, or apparent suspicion.
11'rom them, you must learii tile ireal state of youi' affairs, the chliaracters of your tenants, and tlte value of
your lands.
Make my compliments to Mrs. Boswell. I think her
expectations from air and exercise are the best that lie
cnr form, I hope she will live lonIIg and happily.

Thlat frigid stillness withi whichi my pretty Sophy
melts away, exhiibits a temper very inicommodious ira
sickness, and by no means amiable in tihe tenor of life.
lncommunicative taciturnity neither imparts nor invites fi.iendlship, but reposes on a stuibborn sufficiency
self-centred, and neglects the interchange of thtiat social officiousness by whlich we are habitually endeared
to one an.other. They whio mnean to make no use of
fiienlis, will be at little trouble to gain them; and to
be without frienidship, is to be without one of the first
comforts of our present state. Tl'o have no assistance
fromn other mind(s, in resolving doubts, in appeasing
scrul)lcs, in balancing deliberationis, is a very wretched(l destituttion. If therefore your daughters have this

disposition, wx hich ntmust be coutnteracted and reformeld.

our speedy mneeting in town; and for yotur acceptable

It is true, that the existencee of my fatther, whose
death yet sits heavy on my heart, had been long destitute of all corporeal and intellectual energy: but
it is a state of severe suffering alone, which, thank

imperfect resemblance of what once was.

I am, however, most thankful, that the heart-dear
gratifieations of protecting, comnforting and caressing
that desolated form, so long were mine; since the desolation, thoughli almnost total, was ntot to himself
drear. Pain seldom visited his weak and torpid frame,
and never his mind, during several past years; one
period of al)out two years excepted, in which his failing tmemory made himn perpetutally fancy that hle had
no property, and was become poor. Except in that
interval, his life had been happy above the common
lot. No Unpleasing eirceumstances ever dwelt upon
his joyous imagination.
The pleasure he took in my attendaincee and caresses, survived till within the three last mAonthls, amidst
the general wreck of sensibility. 1is reply to my inquniries after his health,l was always, " Pretty well,

It was only afew days since, and at this place,

deeply yonr affectionate lheart has felt the pains of th-is
separation, I know from experience; and I feel a keen
sympathy with those pains, whlich cai perhaps result
alone from having felt them.
The long cherished, the long beloved, of your hieart,
is no more. She falls, ripe fruit, into the lap of our
general mother. I know thlat thoughl she did not give
you birth, you will often recall her image; and weep
that the venerable form is now withl you only in ideal
presence.
I fear that your deeply injured constitution will suffer yet further from this event: but sweet is thl-e consoling consciousness, so plenteously yours, of having,
during many years, administered withl unwearied care
and tenderness, those comforts to her declining age,
whichli not onlly clheered it, but undoubtedly prolonged its (late.

It is in pursuit of lhecalthl that I hlave travelled tlhus

characters, amidst the large mass of folly, vanity, and
pride, which are conitinually exhiibiting theirci witlhelug effect upon the social pleasures.  Some of the
sweetest of those pleasures, whiichl I have tasted since
I left home, arose from my renewed intercourse with
the Westella family, unbeJheld through so many years.
I passed three delightful days on my way lithl-er,

M ay, 5, 17i3~
If you reeived the first account of my loss
from other hand(is than mnine, you muist imnpute it to
the dejection of mind into vwhich thlat event tlirew me.
1Th1e blow, indeed, fell with too muchI severity, to
leave mne capable of recolleeting myself cnouIgh to
write to you inmcdiately: as thiere cannot. perhaps,
be a greater shock to a breast of any sensibility, than
to see its earliest and most valuable connexions irreparably broken; to find itself for ever torn from the
fiist an(l most enideared object of its highlest venerat iont. At least, the affeetion and esteem I bore to that
excellent parent were founded utpon so many anfld so
uncommon notives, that his deatih hlas given me occasion to lament not only a most tenlder father, Lbut a
most valuable friend.
T?hat I can no longer enjoy the benefit of his ani mating example, is one among the mnany aggr'avatinig eircuiistanees of mny alfietion; and I often apply to myself what ant excellent ancient h,as said upon a sinfilar
occasion, "i Vereor ne nune negligentitus vivane."
rlThere is nothling. in truth, puts us so mulch upon our
our guard, as to act under the constant insp)ection of
one, nhlose virtues as well as years. h1ave rendered
hiiit venerable. Never, indeed, did the dignity of
gootdness appear more i4resistible in any man: yetLETTERS OF SEVERAL
there was something at the same time so gentle in his
manners, suchl an innocenice and a chleerfulness in his
conversation, that he was as sure to gain affection as
to inspire reverence.
It has been observedt, (and I think, by Cowley,) that
a man in much business must make eithler himiself a
knave, or the world will makle him a fool. If thlee is
any truth in this observation, it is not, hlowever, withiout exceptions. My father was early engaged in tile
great scenes of business, in whlichl he contiinued almost
to his very last hour; yet he preserved hlis integrity
firm and iunbroken, throughl all those powerful assaults
whlich he nmust necessarily have encountered in so long
a course of action.
If it werejustice, indee(d, to his other virtuiles, to single oWt any plarticular otne as shining withi superior
lustre t(o the rest, I sIhouldi point to his probity as the
brightest part of lhis clharacter. But the ttrutlh is, the
wlhole tenllour of his conlduct was one unifo-rm exercise of every q(ality that can adlorn and exalt hu:nan
niature.  T'o (Idefend thlle injured, to relieve the indigent, to protect tihe dlistressed, were the c'Mief end and
aim of all his e(ndeavolurs; and his princilpal motive
bothl for engaging and pe-rsevering in his professiony,
was, to enable himiself more abundantly to gratity so
glorious an ambition.
No mnan hlad a highler relishl for the pleasuires of retire(l and contemplative life; as none was mIIore qualfled to enter into, those calm scenes with greater ease
and( dignity. Tie had nothling to make him ldesirous of
flying fromn the reflections of his own mii(l; nor' any
passionls which his moderate patinImony wotild not have
been more thlan sufficient to gratify. Butt to live for
himself only; was not consistent witlh his generous and
enllarged sentiments. It was a spirit of benevolen1ce
that led him into the active scenes of the world: upon
any othler principle, le rwould either never have
entered into them, or soonI have renounced tlhem.

the pattern of that worthy person, from whlom you derive your very being.
A cordial and reverential esteem  for the Divine
Word, was one of his mnost remarkable qualities. rThose
oracles of Heaven were his principal delight, and his
inseparable comp)anions. With unwearied assidutity,
he exercised himself in the law of the Lord. Thence
he derived( his mnaxims of wisdom, antd formed his
judgment of tilings. The precepts of thle Gospel, were
the modlel of his temper, and theguide of his life; and
its precious promises, were the joy of his heart, and
his portion for ever.
Few gentlemen were better furnished, eithler witi
richness of fancy, or copiousness of expression, to bear
a slining part in conversation. With these talents, lhe
always endeavoured to give some useful, generally'somne
religious, turnt to the discourse. Nor did he ever reflect, witli greaiter complacency, on his social hours,
than when they tended to glorify the Eternal Majesty;
and to awaken in himnself and others, a more lively
spirit of devotion.

For your tender admonitions

Rc',e Basil 7woodd to Dr. Conyers.
Greenwichl Road, Nov. 2, iTS:
Reverend and dear sir,
The following particulars, relative to my dearest and most amiable parent, I flattr myself will be far from unacceptable to you. I colDISTINGU[SH ED PERSONS
lccted thlem for mny own private satisfaction, that the
remembnl)ranlce of a frienid, now in glory, whliom I so
dearly loved, mighlt excite me to be more earnest in
pressing forwards to the samie prize. But upl)on reflecting that they mrnighlt be serviceable to otliers as
well as myself; and prove an. additional an(l well aut
thlenticated testimony to the power of religion; I felt
an inclination to commiuniicate themn to my friends.
My (lear and hlonoured mothier was born at Richmnond in Stirry, on tle nineteenth of Apiril, 1736. In
1759, she was married to MAr. Basil Wood(ld; who also was born at Richmond, in 1730, and withi whtom slhe
had been acquainted fronm her infancy.
Suchl a un ion, cemented by long cndearment, and by
simlilarity of disposition, plomiised( a scene of muci
temporal felicity: buit other evenits a mysterious Provi(lence intended. In Janiuiary following, mly father,
beilng from home on a visit, was seized withi a violent fever; and hle (lied on the twelfthi of that month.
Soq great a shlock, on a mintl of her sensibility, couldl
leave'no faint imp)ression: buit it lpleased God to supp)rtlmer in this severe trial; an(l on thle fiftlh of Aug:tust
following shle was delivered of a son. Providence
wonderfully interposed in our faLvour; and bothl root
andl branch, though tl-hen apparently witljering, were
p)reserved togetler, as man-y years longe' as she had
then li e(l.
Tlhe afflictive circumnstance of miy father's death,
proved an eventtual blessing to her, thlough conveyed
in the (lisguise of wo. By one stroke her mind was
severed firom worl(lly prospects; aind she began more
anxiously to seek the knowled(ge an-d love of the Creator. She had, from early life, been of a devout ttirn of

themselves of this opportunity to bring her under the
power of the Gospel. In the spirit of true Christian
friendshlip, tlhey made lher aclquainted withl sound, evange.lical principles. She received th-em in faith and love;
adorned telJm int lici life; a(nd found thlem ler triumpill
in her (lyi6,g hour.
From thbis period, tllte Chlristian motive of love to
hier Lord( gave life- and spirtituality to her mnoral (duties.  Religi(ous exercises became lier soul's (lelight.
She ordinarily retired thlree times in tlhe iay for private prayer; at nmoring, noon, and eveninig. Love
to God led lher, witlh (chlleerfil feet, to the courts of'the
Lor(Ns Houtse  a privilege whlichl sle so higl:y valtued, tihat slic rarely permitted inclement weathler, or
the d(lecay of lhcr hlealth, to iiiteif'cre witl it.
Thlouglh filial affcctio)n may t)e susl)ected of exaggerating a miotlhT's ex ellence, yet I must do lher tlhe
justice to say, tlhat in everiy (lelpartment, in whlichl I
could obse rve her, sle was a lovely oiranient of religionl; particularly, as a daughter, a motlher, and a
mistress.
As a d(laughter, shte was very kindly attentive to
her fatler, wlho died at tlhe advanced age of eighlty seven; and on his deathbe(d, acknowledged, in thie most
affecting mianner, his lo.ng experienlce of her filial
duty.
As a mothier, I imust repeat wlhat you, mny dear sir,
have freqtiucntly said(. that you never sawv such an instance of mateirnal affection. This in(ldeed is a subject,
eon Which I hope I shall( never think without lheart- tfelt
gratitiude to licr, and to God whlo gave mie so excellent
a parentt.  As I was her only chiild, and shle a wid(low,
she mighlt, perhaps, lean to tlle side of over-indullgence.
Yet, if my Iheart (does not deceive me in trusting that
I love the ways of God, I ami in(lebted, tlhrough DiVine grace, for that inestimable benefit, to her gre.at
and tendler kiindness, her uniiforinm examplet, antd particularly to lIer piouis and aflectionate letters wlhen I was

impression of her parental affection, that thlough my
frietnds, I ielieve, have never chlarged me with filial
tegligence, yet, since hler decease, I have regretted
very frequently tlhai, in many little instances, I caonceive I mighlt hiave shown her still more respect and
affection.
As a mistress, she e.xhibited not less excellence. If
shei erred, her error was tthe excess of ki(ndness and
hIimnility. In the few ci-iaiges whllicl halppened in hler
service, her fitrst attention cwas to the spiritual welf're,
of a new servant. And 1 have tlhe p)leastule to state,
th-at l)by the Divitne blessing on lher piouts conversation,
on thle religious books which she )puit into tleir lhJapnds,
and on the kindn(less of her deportmient, tlhree of her
servants were awakenecd to a deep sense of religion.

their marriage. I'lhe vessel, on its return to Peterhead, was
wrecked, ancld thie whole of the captain's property was lost. His
widow, with an infant son,:was left destituite. Shle struggled hard
to maintain herself and her cilild by helr labotur. Her friends contriv-ed to assist her, so as not to hutrt the delicacy of her feelings;
and she frequently said, that she sometimes received aid as if it

AitBUTHN 0 T, John,-a celebrated phlysician, sch6olar a nd
wit, was born, soon after the restoration, at Arbuthnot, near
Montrose;and died in ILondon, on the twenty sevenlth of
February, 1735.
Dr. Johnson, in his life of Pope, describes the chlaracter of
Dr.' Arbuthnot in the following striking terms. " Arbuthiot was estimable for his lea rning, amiable forl his life, and
venerable for his piety. He was a man:of great comprehension, skilful in his profession, versed in tile sciences~ acquainted with ancient literature, and able to animate his mass
of knowledge by a bright and active imagination: a scholar with great brilliance of wit: a wit, who, in the crowd
of life, retained and discoverecd a noble arl dour of religious zeal."  He was much beloved and esteemed by the
nost eminent persons of his time.' He hlas more wit than
we all have," said Swift, " and his hunanity is equal to his
wit..
Hlis principal work is "Tables of ancie nt Coins, Weights
and Measures."' He published also some professional treatises; and several pieces of wit and hunmour.-His letters,
contained in Pope's Epistolary Correspondence, are writtel
withl ease and beautiful simplicity. His thoulghts seem to
drop from his pen as thiey rise into his mindl. "One of tlle
rmost interesting and manally letters in the collection addressed
to Pope,"' says Mr. Hayley, "is the last of Arbuthlnot's,"
(inserted in this volume,) "' containinlg the dying advice of

he gave strong proofs of disaffection to the governrnent. In
1722, he was committedc to the T'ower, oil susp)icion of being
concerned in a plot in favour of the pretender; and in the
following year, he was dCeprived, by a special act of parliament, of all hiis offices, benlefices, and dignities, and was banished the iealm. He spent the remaindcler of his days in
exile; and died, at Paris, on thie fifteen'th of February, 1732.
The character of Atterbury, bothl in a moral and a political poinit of view, has been variously represented; but it is
universally agreed that hle was a man of uncommon abilities,
a fine writer, and an eloquent preacher.-His works are,
chiefly, Sermons in four volumes octavo, and controversial
pieces. His letters, published in the Epistolary Correspondlelnce of Mr. Pope, are remarkable for their ease and elegance; andl they exhibit him, in a pleasing light, both as a
writer and as a man.
BARKER, Johln, a dissenting minister in London, and author of two volumnes of sermons. The rev. Mr. Stedman,

lhe left the university, he was appointed parochial schoolmaster at Fordoun, a small village near.Lawrencekirk. He
continued there about five years; and then went to Aberdeen, where he spent the remainder of his life. On the

philosoplhy and logic in Marischal college; and, during a
long course of years, he was indefatigable in the discharge of
all the dluties of that important and honourable office. By the
gentlest metans, hle preserved the most exact discipline. He
took particular pains deeply to impress the precepts of inorality and religion on the. minds of the young men committed
to his charge. His mild manner, his amiable disposition, and
his fine talents, rendered him the object of their mingled
lov e, respect, and admiration.
In 1770, hie published his first work, (except some juvenile poems,) his celebrated " Essay on the niatiure and immutability of Truth, in opposition to Sophistry and Scepti'
ism;` and,, soon after, his beautiful poem of' T-he Minstrel" appeared. In testimony of high approbation of these
works, particularly of the " Essay on Truth," he received,.i 1773 the honorary degree of doctor of laws from the University of Oxford, and a pensioon of two lhundredl poun(Is a
year from the king.
In the latter years of his life, Dr. Beattie experienced
great afflictions, which he endured with Christian patience
a.nd resignation. His wife had sunk into a state of incurable
derangement, which wholly deprived him of her society and
assistance: his own health was very infirm; and le lost his
two sons, the darling objects of his affection; the elder at
twenty-two, and the younger at seventeen years of age.* The
leath of the latter of them Montagu Beattie, whlo was his
last surviving child, took place in 1796: it seemed almost to
overwhelm him; and, from that time, his hlealth and faculties declined so rapidly, that hle becamre incapable of all application to study or business. After repeated paralytic attacks, he had a severe stroke on the of fifth October, 1802,
which deprived him altogether nf the power of motion. He
languished till the eighteenth of August, 1803, wheni it pleased the Almighty to remove him from this world, in the
sixty-eighth year of hiis age, without any pain or appareint
struggle.
Virtuous tenderness of heart, and acute sensibility, were
distinguishing traits in the character of Dr. Beattie. I-lis
gratitude for favours received, seemed to know no bounds.

Boyrs E, Samuel,-an ingenious poet, was born at Dublin,
in the,year 1708. He was the son of a respectable dissentinig minister. He received a liberal education; his talents
for poetry pirocured him, in early life, conslderable patronage;
and he had many opportqnities of advancing himself in the
world: but through his indolence, extravagance, and dissolute
conduct, he sunk into contempt, indigence, and wretchedness.
The best of his performances is his poem entitled "Deity."
Pope being asked, on the first publication of it, if he were
not the author, said, he was not; but that there were many
lines in it, of which he sh-ould not have been ashamed. Hervey) in his Medlitations, calls it " a very beautiful, sublime,
and instructive poem."  And in his Letters, he says: " It is
a noble piece, quite poetical, truly evangelical, and admirably fitted to alam, and comnfort thle heart, to delight and imnprove."
Hearing of the autlhor's distress, this pious andcl benevolent
man sent him a present of twvo guineas, accompanied by sonme
admonition and advice. Of his kindness, Boyse expressed a
very grateful sense, in the elegant and pathetic letter, inserted in this volume; whichll shlows that, in his last moments) he
was Iinot devoid( of real piety.. Indeed, he often appeared seriously disposed to religion; he frequently talked upon that
subject; and prolbably he suffered very severely from remorse
of conscience. The early impressioins of a good education',
were never entirely obliterated from his mind; and his whole
life was a continuied struggle between his will and his reason.
After a lingering illness, he died, in May, 1749, in obscure
lodgings in Londoln, in the forty-first year of his age; andi, he

CARTER, Elizabeth,-the learned translator of Epictetus,
and the author of several very pleasing little poems on moral
and religious subjects, was born at Deal, on the sixteenth of
December, 1717. Slhe was the eldcest daughter of the Revo
Nicholas Carter, D. D. perpetual curate of the chapel in
that town. HIer early childhood afforded but little promise
of those extraordinary attainments l)y which she was afterwards so eminently distinguishled. Shle acquired the rudliments of learning withl great labour and difficulty. But she
had an earnllest desire to be a schlolar; and by the able instructions anc! assistance of h'er father, and her own indefatigable
application and perseverance, she accomplished her purpose.
Dr. Johnson speaking of a celebrated scholar, said hle understood Greek better than any person whom he hlad ever knownvr
except Elizabeth Carter.-To"' relieve her father, shie v1luntarily toolk upon herself the sole care of educating her youngest brother, by her father's second marriage; andl she discharged the office with maternal tenderness, unwearied diligeice, and the most satisfactory result. In the year 1756, her
pupil, who was designed for the church, was entered at Cambridge, a pensioner of Benet College; having undergone the
previous examination withl great credit both to himself and
hlis sister. About the same time, she completed her translation of the works of Epictetus fromn the original Greek.
Mrs. Carter, botlh d(luring her father's life ancl after his
death, resided( chiefly at Deal; but she usually spent a considerable part of the year in Loindon, where she was mutch
noticed, and her society courted, by the most distinguished
lersons of her time. The Pulteney family were particularlty
attached to her, and entertained a high respect for her talents
and virtues. Knowing that her iortune was not adequate to
hler merit, they settled upon her, ii 1767, an annuity for her
fife, of one hundred pounds a year. Mrs. Montagu, in 1775,

ferring upon her, in the most delicate manner, a simrilar testimony of esteem and regard.
Mrs. Carter, lived to a very advanced age. Her healthi and
bodily strength visibly declitned( some years before shle died;
but she retained the calm, and almost unimpaired possession
of all her mental powers, till within a few hours of hler close.
SkLe went to London a short time before her decease; and died there, on the nineteenth of February, 1806, in the eightyninth year of her age. She expired withoutt a struggle or a
groan.
Mrs. Carter was good and pious firom her childhood; and
as shle advanced in years, her goodness and piety increased:
She niever allowed her literary pursuits, nor thle flattering distinctions which they procured her, to interfere, in the smallest degree, wvith the:regular and conscientious disclharge of
all her religious and domestic duties. Thoughl remarkably
humble, and, in early life, diffident, she took great pleasure
in promoting the moral and intellectual improvement of her
relatives anld friends; and, indeed, of all persons with whom
she was connected. Whlen dining at the tables of the great,
shle always endeavoured, as far as she could without violating
the established forms of society, to give the conversation such
a turn, a, might he useful to the servants who were in attendance: and thus indirectly and in the most gentle and winniing
mranner, often impressed upon their minds truths of the greatest consequence.'lThey listened to her discourse with the utmost earnestness; and in all the families where she was accustomed to visit frequently, they showed her a marked and
zealous attention. A lady of high rank, with whom she was
intimately acquainted, used to say, that she attributed, in a
ver'y considerable degree; the general good conduct of her servants, of whom she hacld a large number, to their hearing so
frequently the conversation of Mrs. Carter.
In the following strikintg admonition to young ladies, Mrs.

physicians, and in compliance with the earnest solicitations of
his friends, hle went to Lisbon, in the autumn of the ensuing
year: but all their hopes of his recovery were vainl. He landed at Lisbon on the thirteenth of October; but he survived the
voyage only a few dlays, and died on the the twenty sixthl of
October, 1751, in the fiftieth y.wr of his age. His remains
were interred in the burying ground of the British factory at
Lisbon.
Of the excellent character of Dr. Doddridge, it is not easy
to speak in tor) high terms, His piety was ardent, unaffected, and chleerful. His moral conduct was, in every respect-,
highly exemplary.  HIe was a most affectionate husband,
father, and friend, and a very kind master; religiously attentive to promote the present comfort, and the eternal happ)iness, of all whlo were connected with him by the tender,
domestic tie. His deportment was polite, affaible, and engaging. -le exercised great candour an'd modleration towards
thlose who differed from him in religious opinions. He never
expected, nor desired, that his pupils shoulld bliildly follow his
sentiments, but encouraged them to judge for themselves;
and carefuLlly checked in them every appearance of bigotry
and uncharitableness.
His miost celebrated and popular works, are:' TheN Rise

where he took the degree of bachelor of civil law, which
gave him every necessary privilege of a university residence,
In 1768, the professorship of modern history at Cambridge,
with a salary of four hundred pounds a year, was conferredc
upon him " unsolicited and unexpected," in the mrost handsome manner, by the duke of Graftoni; but, soon after, his
health declined; and he died at Cambridge, on the thirtieth

His character was amiable and respectable. Withl all the
poet's warmth of imagina,tionr, he had a calnm, sedate disposition. Hie was prudently attentive to economty  but he was
very delicate, and even scrupulous, with respect to pecuniary matters; devoid;of all tincture of avarice; and boutntiful,
even when his circumstances were the most narrow. He was
temperate and upright; a constant friend to virtue; and
much opposed to scepticism and infidelity.
His poems are short, and few in number; but they are,
for the most part, eminently beautiful; and they'are chaste
and moral. His far-famed " Elegy in a country churchyard," one of the miost favourite productions of tlhe British
muse, transcends all praise. His letters, of which a large

HALE, sir Matthew,-lord chief justice of England, an
eminent lawyer, and a most upright judge, was born at Alo
derly, in Gloucestershire, in the year 1609. He received a
religious education; but he did not, in very early life, act in
strict conformity to its precepts. When he was at Oxford,
he took much pleasure in stage entertainments. but finding
that they tended to corrupt his mind, and to divert his attention from study, he wholly relinquished them, and resolved,
on his going to London, never to see a play again; a resolutioil to which he steadfastly aldhered. When he was a student at Lincoln's Inn, the following striking circumstance
made a very salutary impression on his mind. Being with
some other young students, invited to a party ofpleasure, one
of his companions drank to such an excess, that he fell down,
apparently dead. Hale was deeply affected on the occasion.
I-le retired into another room; fell on his knees, and prayed
earnestly to God that his friend might be restored to life, and
that he himself might be pardoned for having given countenance to so much excess; and he made a solemn vow that he
would never again keep company in that manner. His friend
recovered; Hale religiously observed his vow; and, from that
time, spent the remainder of his days in a uniform course of
virtue and piety, and paid the most exemplary attention to
the duties of his profession.--He died at Alderly, after a
long illness, on the twenty sixth of December, 1676, in the
sixty seventh year of his age. "He saw with great joy,,s"
says bishop Burnet, "hlis deliverance approaching. In the
extremity of his pain, he forbore all complaints or groans;
and, with his hands and eyes lifted up, was fixed in his devotions. He continued to enjoy the free use of his reason and
senrse to the last moment, which he had(l often and earnestly
prayed for, during his sickness; and when his voice was so
5unk, that he could not be heard, it was evident from the almost constant lifting up of his hands, that he was still aspiring towards that blessed state, to which he was speedily to
be advanced. His end was peace; he had tno struggling,
nor seemed tobe in any pangs in his last moment.

oftenl gave his servants goodcl advice and instruction; liberally
rewarded their faithfutl services; and never turned(l any of
them  away, except they_were so faulty,.that there was no
hope of reclaiming them.  He was very charitable and humane to the poor; anld his mercifulness and kindness extended even to beasts. In his'profession, his judgment was
clear; his opinion was authority. WVhen at the bar, nothling
could induce him to prostitute his abilities; and though civil
war raged with all the violence of contention, yet he not only preserved his integrity, but lived in ease and security. On
the bench, he reigned' a pure intelligencer.' There he was all
patience; and though the temper of the times too often occasinned innovations in the profession, yet he never gave way
to injustice, however formidable. Nothing could alarm, nor
any thing allure him. Hte held equity to be not only part of
the commYon law, but also one of its principal groutnds. It is
almost incredible that one man could acquire the knowledge
which he possessed; but his apprehension was quick, his memory retentive, his judgment sound, and his application indlefatigable. Notwithstalnding the variety of his avocations,
he daily pressed nearer to perfection by a devotion which.
though elevated, was rational, and( though l,regutlr, was warm,
Hie was a religious observer of the sabbath; and constant in
his at'tendance on pulblic worship, on that day. For a long
tinme he concealed the consecrationt of himself to the strictest
duties of religion, lest b.y some adventitious actionlhe sh)oltd
bring piety into disgrace. Hle taughlt the theory of Chiistianity by lIis precepts, and the practice by his example.

The faith which influenced his own actionrs, he religiously
communicated to others; he improved devotion where he

HAWKESWORTH, John,-an elegant writer, was born in
the year 1715. Few particulars of his life are kno;vn. He
resided, for many years, at Bromley, in Kent; where his
wife kept a boarding-school for young ladies, which was
much encouraged, and was a source of considerable emolurinent. In 1752, he began his most celebrated work, a periodical publication, entitled "The Adventurer;" to which
Dr. Johnson was a liberal contributor, and which wvas afterwards collected into four volumes duodecimo. This workis
distinguished by elegance of language, force of sentiment,
and an evident tendency -to promote virtue and piety. Dr.
Herring, archbishop of Canterbury, was so much pleased
with it, that he conferred upon the author the degree of doctor of civil law.-In 1772, Hawkesworth was appointed to the
very lucrative and hononrable office of compiling "An Ac;
count of the Voyages undertaken, by order of his present
Majesty, for making discoveries in the South Seas;" but the
mananer in which he executed it, was, in many respects, lia)ble tomuch and very serious objection. The work was ill
received by the public. This circumstance greatly affected
and chagrined him; and, it is said, even contributed to shorten his days: for he was a man, who, with many amiable
qualities, possessed an irritable temper, and a too poignantt
sensibility. He d(lied on the sixteenthl of November, 1773,
aged fifty eight years. A handsome monument was erected
to his memory in Bromley church. - The following lines,
from the concludinig number of the Adventurer, form part of
the inscription.

HERVEY9 James,-a clergyman of exemplary virtue and
piety, and a very popular writer, was born in the year 1714,
at Hardingstone, a village near Northampton. Soon after he
had completed hiis studies at Oxford, he accepted a kind invitation froni his much esteemed friend, Paul Orchard, esq.
to spend some time at Stoke Abbey, in Devonshire the seat
of that worthy gentleman; and he continued there more than
two years. He theti undertook the curacy of Biddeford, in
the same county. When he had held it about two years and
a half, the rector died. The new incumbent dismissed Mr.
HIervey; contrary to the united request of the parishioners,
by whom he was so highly beloved and esteemed, that they
offered to maintain him at their own expense. In 1752, he succeeded, by the death of his father, to the benefices of Weston and Collingtree, in Northamptonshire; and from that
time, till his death, he constantly resided at Weston.
He was zealous and indefatigable in the exercise of all
his ministerial duties. In the pulpit, he was highly animated, and he evidently felt the efficacy of what he preached.
lHe did not satisfy himself withl the usual service on Sundays,
but, while his strength. permittedcl, he delivered a weekly lecture every Wednesday evening. He diligently catechised thle
children of his parishioners; and he -was regular in his pastoral visits to their houses, till he was prevented by illness,
when he encouraged them to confe to him, for his friendly and
religious advice.
His healthl was naturally very delicate: but a considerable time before his death, h1e fell into a decline, attended
with an incessant hectic cough, and mnuchl acute pain; which
he supported with great resignation, and without the least
expression of- impatience or of peevishness. Being at length
quite exhausted, he died without a groan or a struggle, on
Christmas dlay, 1t758, in the forty fifth year of his age; deeply regretted by his friends and p)arishioners.
Mr. Hervey's temper was remarkably placid, and unaffectedly humble. In his dealings withi others, he was punc
tual, just, and candid, kind, and obliging. He was liberal
and beneficent to the utmost extent of his means. In every
expense relating,to himself, he was extremely frugal, in order that hle might have the more to give to others. The profit arising from the sale of his works, was very considerable:
and he dedicated the whole to charitable purposes.fZ42.

HORPNF,, George,-bishop of Norwich, was born in the year
1730; at Othamr in Kent, of which place his father was rector. Fromi very early youth, he applied to his studies with
commendable diligence andc assiltduty, endeavouring to furnishl
his mind with rich stores of various learning, a(nd particularly
aiming to render the attainment of polite literature subservienrt to the knowledge and illustration of the Scriptures.
At twenty three years of age, after a dlue and serious preparation, he took orders; and soonI obtained great reputation
as a preacher, on account of the excellence of his compositionis, and the gracefuLlness of his elocution.--In May, 1790,
he was advanced to the episcopal dignity: but his healtlh,
naturally delicate, was then in a very precarious state; and,
soon after, his friends observed with sorrow that he rapidly
declined. In the autumn of the ensuing year, he had a paralytic stroke. HIe lingered for a few weeks; during which
he retained the fill possession of his faculties, a(nd displayed
exemplary patience and composure. Full of faithi and hope,
he died at Bath, on the seve nteenth of January, 1792, in the
sixty secoind ye-ar of his age.
It seldom falls to the lot of a biographer to record a man
so uniformly excellent in character and conduct, as bishop
Horne.- All his various lMarning, and all his fine talents,
were, with deep humility, consecrated to religion, and to the
promotion of the best interests of mankind. His life was exemplarily virtuous. He possessed great simplicity and tenderness of heart. His disposition was cheerful and amiable;
and he was a very agreeable, as well as an instructive companion. To mnost of the public charities, which are the gloB13JOGRAPHI CAL NO)TICES,                   9

chlarities also were large and. extensive. He laid( up nothing from his pl)referments in the clhurch. WhVlen he was no
loser at the end of the year, le was perfectly satisfied. T'he
greatest part of what he gave away, was bestowed with so
niuchl secrecy, that it was supposed by some persons to be
little; but, after his death, when tlhe pensioners to whom he
had been a constant benefactor, rose up to look about them
for some othler support, it began to be known who, and how
many, they were.

JOHNSON, Samuel'-one of the most eminent of our classical Englishl writers, was born at Lichfield, on the eighteenth
of September, 1709. HeI received his education chliefly at the
free school in his native city. His studies at Oxford were of
short duration, on account of the insolvency of his father, a
bookseller, at Lichfield.-At the age of twenty six, Johnson
married Mrs. Porter, a widlow. She was much older than
himself: but he was sincerely attached to her; and, after
a union of more than fifteen years, he deeply regretted her
deathl. Soon after his marriage hle fixed his residence in London. By the publication of his "Dictionary of the English
language," his "' Rambler," and many other of hlis admirable
works, he obtained only a very scanty anid precarious subsistence, till the year 1762, when the king granted him a pension of tlhrtee hundred pounds a year, expressly as a reward
for the gr,:at merit, and the moral tendency, of his writings,.
A few years afterward, he was highly gratified b'y an interview with his royal patron, in the library at the queen's hlouse:
an honour whichl was wholly unsolicited and unexpected br
him. During the course of the conversation, thle king asked
him if hle intended to publish any more works. Jolinsol  modestly replied, that he thought he had written enough. " I
should have thiought so too," said the king, "if you had not
wvritten so well."
In 1765, Johnson was complimented by the University of
Dublin, with the degree of doctor of laws, on account, as the
diploma expressly declares, of the singular elegance and utility of his writings: and about ten years afterward, he received a similar lionour from the University of Oxford.
In 1781, Dr. Johnson experienced a severe affliction by the
d(leath of hIis muchl esteemed friend, Mr. Thrale; at whose
house, during an intinmacy of fifteen years, he had been a very frequenit and an ever welcorne guest. And soon after that
loss hle perceived that the kiind attention whi.ch he had been
accustomed to receive from Mrs. Thrale and her family, gradually declined; a circumstance which his long and sincere
attachment to them, and his inCreasing in,firmities, rendered
peculiarly afflictiiVe.
Dr. Johnson was of a large stature, and possessed great
bodily strength; Dbut he Was, fronm his childhood, troubled
withl scrophulolut hu ilmours. A constitutional nmelancholy harassed him-,-more or less, through every jpe)riod of his life:BOG 11ARA1HI 1CAL NT()TICDS
and his temper seerns to lhavre beetn oaturallv irritable. In
1783, he lhad a paralytic stroke; which was succeeded by a,,asthma and a dropsy. Death' had l1ng been an object of
terror to himr; and he could not view its near approach
without dismay. He had lost his domestic companions, and
maniy of his kindest friends; he was opprtessed wvith illness
and deeply affected Avwith a sense of his own unworthiness,
and mnanifold trantsgressions. A short time before his decease, his mind became composed and resigned. " All his
fears," says Dr. Brocklesby, his physician, " were calmed
and absorbed by the prevalence of his faith, andcl by his trust
in the merits and propitiation of Jesus Christ."  He often
said to his t:aithful servant; "Attend F'rancis, to the salvation of your soul, which is the object of the greatest imtnportance to you;" explained to him passages in the Scripture
and seemed to take pleasure in talking on religious subjects.
On the thirteenth December, 1784, in the seventy sixthl year
of his age, he expired, about seven o'clock in the evening,
with so little apparent pain, tlhat his attenidants scarcely, per -
ceived when his dissolution took place.
The principal works of Dr. Johnson, are his invaluable
Dictionary," which has nearly fixedcl the external form of
our language, and which, notwithstanding some inaccuLracies,
is the acknowleclged standard of the English tongue;,is
S' Rambler," which togetlher with his "Idler,' holds a distinguishied rank among the best of our British essays;' Rasselas," a beautiful moral tale; "Poems;"'A  Journey to.
the Western Isles of Scotland;" "Lives of the Enrglish
Poets;" "Prayers and Meditations."-It seems to have been
the earnest desire of Dr. Johnson that all his.writings might
tend to the promotion of piety, and be founcd eexactly coniformably to the precepts of Chlristianity. In his Dictionary, as
one of his friends o)serve:s,'he was solicitous to avoid all references to books of an itmmoral or irreligious tendency. " I
shall never," sayss he. in the last paragraph of thle Rambler,
" envy the honours wlhiclh wit anId learning obtain in any other
cause, if I can be numnbered lamong the writers wlho have
given ardour to virtue, and confidence to truth."
A large collection of his Letters is contained in his Life,
written by his&lt;friend Mr. Boswell; antd his F.pistolary Corl
respondence witlh Mrs. Thrale, has been published by that
lady.--" His Lettets" says Dr. Anderson,' are valuable,

as we find in them the picture, which, without inltending it,
hle has left of himself, to be that of a man, who, to great intellectual powers, added extraordinary piety, and many excellent mnoral qualities. We see him in his undress, that is, the
undress of his mind, which unlike that of his body, was never
slovenly. VWe see him in health and in sickness, and in all
the petty business of life. From himself, and in his own
words, we are enabled to collect the best information. He
wvrites always in his own style. His words are now and then
too pompous for familiar letters; but his skill in letter-writing comnes out fully, and entitles him to rank with the best
epistolary writers of our nation."
Ont reviewing thle-life and character of Dr. Johnson, bishop
Horne makes thle following very beautiful and striking remarks. " From the mixture of power and weakness in the
comnposition of this wonderful man, the scholar should learn
humility. It was designed to correct that pride whiich great
parts and great learning are apt to produce in their possessor.
In him it had the desired effect. For, though consciousness
of superiority might sometimes induce him to carry it high
withl men, (and evenr this was much abated in the latter part
of life,) his devotions have shown to the world, how hiumbly
he walked at all timnes wvith his GoD.
His example may likewise encourage those of timid and
gloomy dispositions not to despond, when they reflect, that
the vigour of such an intellect could not preserve its possessor from the depredations of melanchl6ly. They will cease to
be surprised and alarmed at the degree of their own sufilrings; they will resolve to bear with patience antd resignation
the malady to which they find a Johnson subject, as well as
themselves: and if they want words, in which to ask relief
from HEzi who alone can give it, the God of mercy, and Fathler of all comfort, language affords no finer than those in
which his prayers are conceived.
That he should not be conscious of the abilities with which
Providence had blessed( him, was impossible. He felt his own
powers; he felt what he was capable of having performed;
and he saw how little, comparatively speaking, lie hlad performed. Hence, his apprehensions on the near prospect of
the account to be mnade; viewed through the medium of constitutional and morlbid melancholy, which often excluded
from his sight the bright beams of Divine Mercy. May those298        BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES;
beams ever shine upon us! But let them not cause us to forget, that talents have been bestowed, of which an account
must be rendered; and that the fate of the "unprofitable
servant" may justly beget apprehensions in the stoutest mind.
Let us only put in practice the duty of self examination; let
us inquire into the success we have experienced( in our warfare against the passions, or even against the undue indulgence of the common appetites, eatiing, drinking, and sleeping; and we shall soon perceive how much more easy it is to
form resolutions than to execute them; and we shall no longor find occasion: to wonder at the weakness of Johnson.
The little stories of his oddities-and infirmities in common
life; will, after a while, be overlooked and forgotten; but
his writings will live for ages, still more and more studied and
admilred, wvhile Britons shall continue to be characterizedI by
a love of elegance and sublimity, of good sense and virtue.
The sincerity of his repentance, the steadfastness of his faith,
and the fervour of his charity, forbid us to doubt, that his sun
set in clouds to rise without them: and of this let tus always
be mindful, that every one who is mnade better by his books,
will add a wreath to his crown,"
JoNEs, William;-a pious and worthy clergyman of the
churchl of England, was born at lowick in Northamptonshire,
in the year 1726. About the year 1776, hle accepted the
perpetual curacy of Nayland, in Suffolk; and he resided there
during the remainder of his days, no future offer of preferment ever tempting him to quit it. He died on the sixth of

JONES, sir William1--an eminent iawyer, acnd a most ac,
complished scholar, was born in London, in the year 1746. He
lost his father when hle was only three years of age; and the
care of his education devolved upon his mother, a woman of
uncommon mental endowments, At seven years of age, he
went to Harrow school, anrd he remained( there aboutt ten
years; during which time he Wvas enabled, by the most sedulous application, to lay in ample stores of knowledge. He
pursued his studies, on a very extensive plan, at University
college, Oxford, with the same assiduity anid success. In
1770, he entered at the Temple. He did not, however, sacrifice, to professional studies all those literary pursuits which
till then had so delightfully occupied him. Oriental learning, in particular, continued to attract his attention. Itn 1783,
he- was appointed a judge of the supreme court of judicature
at Fort William, in Bengal; and at the same timre the hon-..our of knighthood was conferred upon him. This appoint*
ment had long been the object of hlis wishes, prinicipally on ace
count of the opportunity which it would afford himn of gratify.ing his love of oriental researches. About the same time,
he married a very amiable and accomplished lady, Anna
Maria Shipley, the eldest daughter of the-bishop of Sto
Asaphl; and she accompanied himn into India. The climate
was not favourable to his health. On the twentieth of April
1794, he was seizedcl, at Calcutta, with an inflammation of
the-liver, which resisted all remedies; and, on the twenty
seventh of that month, p)ut a period to his existence, without
any pain or struggle. He died in the forty eighth year of
his age; in the fuLll vigour of his mental powers, and in the
midst.of those vast projects of literature, which might haye
employed an active life protracted to the utmost limits allotted to the human race. Few mien have died more respected300oo      BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICESo
or more regretted, as few have passed a more useful and isreproachable life.
" In the short space of forty seven years," says his excelleknt
friend and biographer, lord Teignmouth. "he acquired a
knowledge of arts, sciences, and languages, which has seldom
been equalled, and scarcely, if ever, surpassed. As a philologistl he could boast a universality in which he had no rival.
His skill in the idioms of India, Plersia, and Arabia, has perhaps never been equalled by any Eluropean.-A mere catalogue of his writings, would show the extent and variety of
his erudition; a perusal of them will. prove that it was not
less deep than miiscellaneous. Whatever topic he discusses,
his ideas flow with ease and perspicuity. His style is always
clear and polished; animated and forcible when his subject
requires it. His Philological, Botanical, Philosophical, antL
Chronological Disquisitions, his Historical researches, and
even his Persian Grammar, whilst they fix the curiosity and attention of the reader, byr. the novelty d(epth, or im,
portance of the knowledge displayed in them, always delight
by elegance of diction. Literature and science come from his
hlands, adorned with all their grace and beauty.-Of his studies in general it may be observed, that the end which he always had in view was practical utility; that knowledge was
not accumulated by him, as a source of mere intellectual re-creation, or to gratify an idle curiosity, or for the idler purpose of ostentatiously displaying his acquisitions. To renderhimself useful to his country and mankind, and to promote
the prosperity of both, were the primary and permanent motives of his inrdefatigable exertions in the pursuit of knowledge.-I could with pleasure expatiate on the independence
of his integrity, on his probity, as well as on his humanity
and benevolence, of which every living creature participated.

character.'
LYT T L E TON, George, lord,--an illustrious English nobleman, and a distinguished writer, was the eldest son of sir
Thomas Lyttleton, of Hagley, in Worcestershire; where he
was born in the year 1709. When his education was completed, he obtained a seat in parliament; and in course of times
he filled many high offices of state. In 1741, he married(
miss ILucy Fortescue, sister of the earl of Clinton. With her
he lived in the utmost conjugal harmony and felicity, till h-er
death, which took place in January, 1747; a few (lays after
he had written the letter to his father, (inserted in this volume,) which expresses,in very affecting terms, his tender
solicitude for her, and his pious resignation to the will of Heaven. In his beautiful Monody, and in the inscriptions on her
monument in the church at Hagley, he 1ias paid a very pleasing tribute to the memory of this amiable and accomplishled
lady, who died at the early age of twenty nine.
In the pride of juvenile confidence, with the help of corrupt conversation, Lyttleton had entertained doubts of the
truth of Christianity; but hle was sensible that it is not
proper to believe or disbelieve by chance, and he applied(
himself seriously to an investigation of the subject. His
studies being honest, ended(l in conviction. He found that
Religion is true; and what he had learned he enleavoired
to teach, by "Observations on the Conversion and Apostleship of St. Paul," published in 1747; " a treatise," says
Dr. Johnson, " to which Infidelity lhas never been able to
fabricate a specious answer."  This book his father had
the happiness of seeing; and, in a most affectionate letter
to him, expressed his approbation in the following terns.
" I have read your religious treatise with inlfilite pleasure
and satisfaction. The style is fine and clear; the argunments are close, cogent, and irresistible. May the Kin,
of kings, whose glorious cause you have so well defended, reward your pious labour s; and grantit that I mnay be found
worthy, thllrough the merits of Jesus Christ, to be an eyewitness of thiat hlappiness wlhich, I do not doubt, he will abunidantly bestow upon you! In the mean time, I shall niever cease

Prose and Verse."
About two years after the death of his first wife, he married her intimate friend, the eldlest daughter of sir RIobert
Rich: but all his hopes of happiness from a union with this
lady were disappointed; and after a few years, a separation,
by mutual consent took place. This event, together with
thle profligate conduct-and licentious principles of his only soin,
and other domestic afflictions, greatly imbittered the remainder of his days; and afforlded full scope for thle exercise of his
Chlristian virtues.
He died at Hagley, on the twenty second of August, 1773,
aged sixty four. On hiis deathbed, lie said to the physician
who attended him: "When I first set out in the world, I had
friends who endeavoured to shake my belief in the Christian
religion. I saw difficulties Which staggered me; but I kept
my mind open to coniviction. The evidences anld doctrines of
Christianity, studied with attention, made me a mIost firm
and persuaded believer of the Christian religion. Ihave made
it the rule of my life; and it is the groiund of my future hopes.
I have erred and sinned; but I have repented, and I have
never indulged in anly vicious habit. Int politics andl public
life, I hlave made the public good the rule of mny conduct. I
never gave counsels, which I did( not, at the time, think the
best. I have seen that I was sometimes in the wrong; but
I did not err designedly. I have endeavoured, in private life,
to do all the good( in my power; and I never could, for a mominent, indulge malicious or unjust designs upon any person."
Cotemporary writers are lavishin the praise of Lord I,ytlteton.'I he following extract ftrom a letter of Dr. Beattie to
the earl of Kinnoill, speaks the genutine language of heartfelt affection, respect, a-nd esteem. " Mrs. Montagu is much
afflicted at the, deathi of oiur great'and( good friend, lord Lyttleton. This event was unexpected; it is little better than
a fortnight since I redeived a very kind letter from him. T'he
loss to his friecnds, and to society, is unspeakable and irreparable: to himself his death is infinite gain; for, whetiher we
consider what he felt here, or whlat hle hoped foir hereafter,
we must admit that no mani ever had more reason to wish
for a dismission from the evils of this transitory life. H isBIOGRAPHICAL NOT'ICES.                      303

on the fifteenth of March, 1799, aged eighty nine. He was
the eldest son (by a second wife) of an eminent advocate, the
authlor of anr excellent ancl popular treatise on the " Great
Importance of a religious Life." The little tribute of filial

MIDDLETON, Conyers,-a clergyman of the church of

yet he would not condescend to recover-their good opinion by
retracting whiat he had hastily land unwarily advanced.
H'ence, the obstruction to his views of preferment; which,
by degrees, soured his temper so much, that his best friends
(as Mr. Warburton found by experience) could not calm his
resentments, or keep them from breaking out into some unhappy prejudices against Religion itself. His knowledge of
theology was but slighlt, and his talents were not those which
qualified him to excel in that science. The bent of his genius lay another way, and had raised him to great eminence
in prolite literature; of which his'Letter from Rome,' andl
his' Life of Cicero,' are shining instances. His other works
will soon be forgotten."-"' Had he had," says bishop Warburton, in one of his letters, written a short time before doctor Middleton's death, " I will not say piety, but greatness

MONTAGU, Elizal)eth,-daughter of Matthew Robinson,
Esq. was born at York, in the year 1720. In 1742, slhe
married Edward Montagu, esq. grandson of the first earl of
Sandwich, a gentleman of large property and great worth.
She derived considerable assistance in her education from
the author of the Life of Cicero, Dr. Conyers Middleton, wiho
had married her grandmother. In hler chiildhood and youth,
her beauty, and uncommon sensibility, vivacity, anld wit, attracted pecuLliar notice and admiration. She did not, in early
life, receive those strong impressions of the truthl of divine
revelation, which she acquired, at a later period, chiefly
thlrough the instrumontality of her two excellent friends, Mr.
Gilbert West antd Lord I,yttleton. The steady principles
of Christianity corrected the exuberance of her genius, and
gave the last touchles of improvement to her finle character.
As she advalnced in life, she displayed uncomn:nmon strength
of understanding, refinemenit of taste, anld warmth of benevolence. Slhe possessed the friendship, and her hospitable
mansioni was the favourite resort, of the most eminenit persons of her time. Shle was pleasingly distinguished by her
kind attention to poor chimnieysweepers; whom she annually entertained with roast heef and plum pudding, every
May-day, on the lawn before hller house.
Mr.o Montagu, her husband, died in 1775. He was many
years older than heriself; but shle was a most exemplary wife,
and they livTed togethler very happily. He shlowed his great
esteem land affection for her, by bequeathing to her almost
the whole of his large fortune; of Which she made a very
noble and liberal use.  Consider me alwxvays, ", says she iin

PoPE, Al'xander,-the eleganit translator of HTomer's
Iliad and Odyssey, and an original poet of great celebrity,
was horn in London, on tile eighlth of June, 1688. He went
to several inferior schools; but he derived so little assistance
hfom them, that he may, in goo(l degree, be considered as
self-taught." His l)redilection for poetry appeared at a -ery early age.-About thlle time of the IRevolution, his father,
who, it is said, wv.as a linendraper in the Strand, qulitted blsiness, anid retired to Binfield in Windsor Forest. There, Mr.
Pope lived withi his parents, till thlle year 1715: wien beitng

for his version of tlhe Iliad(l, to live more agreeably to his
clhoice tihan hle had clone before, lhe purchased that house at
Twickenham, to which his residence afterwardls procured
so mnuchl celebrity; and he remnoved thithler with his father
and mother. His father died about two years after     h is
mother lived till 1733; and( died, at the great age of niniety
three, but not unbeloved or unilamented.  To the latest moment of her lo;g life shie received froim hler son the most
kinid and unwearied attention} In his letters, anid in several of his poetical works, he makes very affectionate mention
of hlier, particularly in the following lines.
"Me, let the tender office long engage,

Atterbury, and mnany othler of his friendts was, at first, publishled surreptitiously and a fterwards by -i nm selfi; and it is

Jolthnson, " with praises of hiis candour, tenderness, and benevolence, tihe purity of his purposes, aind the fidelity of his
friendship.  Some read it as a conltemporary history, and
some as a model of epistolary language. Pope is seen in this
collection asconnected with othier contemporary wits, and certainly lie suffers no disgrace in the comparison. But it must be
rememnbered that he had the power of favouring himself;
he mighlt have originally had publication in his ep)istolary

or mnost diligently laboured'; and I know not whether there

education at Christ's College, Cambridge; where he residedt
maniy years. He was destined for the church, as well by his
own deliberate chloice, as by the wishes of his family; and.
accordingly, at the age of twenty six, he took orders. Some
years afterwards, hie was presented to the rectories of iIunton and of Lambeth; and he resided, alternately, at botli
those places.  In 1776, hle was promoted to the see of Clhester, and ill 1787 to that of Lond(lon.. All his preferments
were unsought for and unsolicited by. him. In the spring of
1809, after a gradual decline of his hlealthl and strength, his
nend seemed fast approaching. EIe contemplated that event,
and prcparedl for it, with calm resignation, aind devout subsubmission-to the wvill of God. On the eleventhl of May, he
was, at his ownv desire, removed from London to Fulllam.
The chlange of air and scene seemned to revive him. But onl
the following day, whilst he was sitting at dinmer, he was
seized with sliglht convulsions. Soon after, he fell into a gentle sleep; and without a pang or a sigh, by a transition so
easy, as to be knrown on-ily by a pressure of his-hand upon the
knee of his servant, whlo was sitting niear him, his spirit de)arted from its earthly mnansion, on the thirteenthi of May,
1809, in the seventy ninth year of hiis age.
This truly Cristian bishop was a splendid and benignant
light in the world; an ornament to the times in whlich hle livedl. In all the various stations which he filled in the church,
he was highly- (listinguished by his persuasive eloquence in
the pulpit; by his zealous attachment to the interests of religion and morality; and by his conscientious discharge
of all the duties of his profession. Firm  and fixed in his
own principles, he was candid and liberal in his sentiments of others. He abounded and delighted in acts of
charity, of kindness, and beneficence. He was cheerful,
meek, and humble) in his disposition; affable and courteous
in his deportment. The predlominant object of all his wishes and desires, was "in every thing he did) to do it to the
glory of God." He lived as he taught others to live.
His works are: "Sermons;" " Lectures on the Gospel
of St. Matthew;"'" Life of archbishop Secker;" " Suimmary of the principal Evidences of the truth -and divine origin
of the Christian Rleligion;" " Death, a poem;" and various
tracts on useful and important subjects.

ROWE, 9 Elizabeth,-a beautiful, and highly accomplished
woman, was born at lchester, on the eleventh of September,
I674. She was the daughter of Mr. Walter Singer, a respectable dissenting minister. Very early in life, she discovered great talents for music, painting, and poetry; and a
devout turn of mind. In the year 1710, she married Mr.
Thomas Rowe, a gentleman of great parts, learning, and
worth; with whom she lived very happily for about five
years, when it pleased Divine Providence to put a period to
his life. Her elegy on this mournful event is deservedly
ranked among the best of her poetical works. After the
death of her husband, she spent the remainder of her days,
in retirement, at Frome. Deeply regretted, especially by
the poor of her neighbourhood, to whom she was a most kind
benefactress, she died there, after a few hours illness, (sup.
ppsed to be an apoplexy) on Sunday morning, February the
twentieth, 1737.
Her works are: " Friendship in Death, in twenty letters
from the dead to the living;" Letters Moral and Entertaining;"' Devout Exercises of the Heart in med(litation and
soliloquy, praise and prayer;" and " Miscellaneous Pieces,

SEwARD, Anna,-a distinguished poetess, was born at

Seward. His daughter remained mistress of an easy and independent fortune. She continued to inhabit the episcopal
palace at Lichfield, which had long been her father's residence; and she died there, on the twenty fifth of March,
1809.
To Walter Scott, esq. she bequeathed, for publication, her
poetical works; and to Mr. Constable of Edinburgh, a large
collection of her letters, written between the years 1784 and
18a7. "Her poemns," says Mr. Scott, "' contain vivid traces
of genius;-and her elegies on major Andre and captain
Cook, convey a highl impression of the original powers of their
author." Her letters, published in six volumes, small octavo, exhibit a capacious antd well stored mind, and a lively
fancy. They abound withi anecdotes of distinguished persons, andl withi remrnarks oni moral, critical, and political subjects, which, though not always just, are always ingenious.
But thieir principal ciharm is the lively and natural display of
her sentiments, her feelings, and affectioins; her ardent love
of literature, anid regard to its interests; her genuine applause
of contemporary merit; the enthusiastic warmth of her friendship, unextinguished by absence, or by death; and, above
all, her tender solicitude for her father, and her dlutiful, unwearied attention to him, during ten long years of bodlily ai-nd
mental decline. The style of her letters is correct:,and elegant; but its beauty and simplicity are mulch impaired, by
the too frequent use which she makes of transposition, of
conmpounded epithets, and of poetical imagery.

Beauchamp, a very promising youth, (of whom an account is
given in 6' true Stories, or, Interesting Anecdotes of Young
Persons,") who died, o0n his travels, at nineteen years of age;
and a daughter, who was afterwards dutchess of Northumberland.-In 1748, lord Hertford( succeeded- to the title and
estate of his father, Charles Seymour, duke of Somerset; and
died about two years afterwards.
The dutchess of Somerset, after the loss of her husband,
lived retired at Piercy Lodge, near Colibrook; and died
there on the seventh of July, 1754.
Her Correspondence with the countess of Pomfret, has
been publishied; and several of her letters to Dr. Watts,
Dr. Doddridge, Mlr. Shenstone, and other distinguishied persons, are contained in various collections.-'To this noble
lady, Thomson dedicates his Spring; and justly characterizes her, as
"fitted or to shine in courts
With unaffected grace or walk thle plain
With innocence and meditation join'd
In soft assemblage."
STRAFFORD, Thomas Wentworth,-earl of, descended
from a very ancient family in Yorkshire, was born in London, onl the thirteenth of April,-1593. He possessed great
talents, togethler with uncommon vigour an(l elevation of
mind. The powerful support which he afforded to the government of king Charles the first, and the great favour
which he enjoyed with that monarch, rendered hitn peculiarly obnoxious to the popular party. At the first meeting;
of the'Long Parliament, he was impeached of high treason.
On his trial, he made a most noble defence. which he concluded with these remarkable words: " I thank' God, I
have been, by his blessing, sufficiently instructed in the extreme vanity of all temporary enjoyments, compared to tllhe
importance of our eternal duration. And so, my lords, witi
all humility, and all tranquility of mind, I submit, clearly and
freely, to your judgments: - and wh lether that doom shall be
to life or death, I shall repose myself, full of gratitude and
confidence, in the arms of the great Author of my existence.'
Wliitlocke, who was himself the chairman of thlat com.mittee which conducted the impeachinent, observes, with
FfS           NAP RATIVE LETTERS.
He was taken ill in the night of the thirtietlh of Novei Sch:t 1789; and f'oml that time lhis decline commeced    it wa-s log-' what 1l)ysicians call a nervous
atrophy;- but towards the end of June, symptomts began to app-;ear of his lungs being affected. Goats'
milk, ad afterwards asses' mtilk, were procured for
him in abund.ance; and stuchl exercise as he could bear,
he regulariy took. Th'lese means lengt!lened hIis (lays,
no dotubt; anq alleviated his suffie rings, which, indeed,
were not often severe. But, in spite of all' that could
be (lone, he grew weaker and wealker, and (lied on thle
nineteenthi of Novetmlber, 1790, without comnplaint or
pain, without even a groan or a sigh; retaining to the
last mtomnent tl:e use of hlis rational faculties. He lived
twenty two years and thirteen days. Many weeks
before death came, hle saw it appr):oaching; and ihe
met it witi suchl composure and pious resignation, as
mnay no doubt be equalled, butt cannot be surp)assed.
He has left many things in writing, seious and
humorous, scienitific atnd miscellaneous, prtose and
verse, Latin and Englishl; but it will be a long time
before 1 shall be able to hlardein my heart so far as to
revise them.
I hlave the satisfaction to know, tliat every thing has
been done for lhim that could be done; and every thing
according to the best medical advice tltat Scotland
could afford. For the last five months, I kept in my
family a young medical firiend, who was constantly at
hand: and from the beginniing to tlhe eind of my son's
illness, I was always either by him, or within call.
From these circumstances, your grace will readily belieVe, tl,t I derive no little satisfaction. Butt nmy

of his life; whiclh was one uninterrutpted exercise of

his usual candour:, Certainly, never any man acted such a
part, on such a theatre, with more wisdom, constancy and
eloquence, with greater reason, judgment, and temper, and
with a better grace in all his words and actions, than did
this excellent person; and he moved the hearts of all his auditors, some few excepted, to remorse and pity. His enemrnies despairing, by a legal prosecution, ever to obtain sen,
tence against him, had recourse to a bill of attainder, which,
with difficulty, passed bothl houses of parliament, The king
was strongly urged to give his assent to the bill; and he was
intimidated by threats: but he had solemnly assured the
earl of his protection, and he felt an anxious concern to save
the life of his most faithful friend and minister. Under
these affecting ciircumstances, lord Strafford wrote a letter to
him, entreating him, for the sake of public peace, to'put an end
to his unfortunate however innocent life, and to quiet the tumultuous people by granting them the request for which they
were so importunate. " In this," added he, " my consent
will more acquit you to God than all the world can do besides. To a willing mind there is no injury. And as, by
God's grace, I forgive all the world with a calmness and
meekness, which are of infinite contentment to my dislodging
soul; so, sir, to you I can resign the life of this vorld with
all imaginable cheerfulness, in just acknowledgment of your
exceeding favourso"9  After much agitation and doubt, the
king granted a commission to four noblemen to give the royal assent, in his name, to the bill; and he sent his secretary
to inform lord Strafford of the final resolution, whlich necessity had extorted from him. The earl, on receiving the intelligence, seemed surprised, and affected; but he soon collected his courage, and, with great piety, prepared himself to
suffer the fatal sentence. In passing firom his apartment to
Tower-hill, where the scaffold was erected, he stopped under
the windows of archbishop Laud, with whom he had long
lived in intimate firiendship; and entreated the assistance of
his prayers, in those awful moments which were approaching. The aged primate dissolved in tears; and having pronounced, with a broken voice, a tender blessing on his departing friend, sunk into the arms of his attendants. Lord
Strafford moved on with an elated countenance, and with an
air even of greater d(lignity than that which usually attended
him. He was not buoyed up by glory, nor by the affectionate
3ilBIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES.                       is'
compassion of the spectators. Yet his mind, erect and undaunted, found resources within itself; and maintained its
unbroken resolution, amidst the terrors of death, and the triumphant exultation of his misguided enemies. His discourse
on the scaffold was full of decency and cour`age.: He feared," he said, " that the omen was bad for the intended reformation of the state, as it commentced with the shedding of
innocent blood."  Having bid a last adieu to his brother and
friends who attended him, and having sent a blessing to his
nearer relations who were absent; "'And now," said he,
6 I have nearly done! One stroke will make my wife a widow, my dear children fatherless, deprive my poor servants
of their indulgent master, and seperate me from my affectionate brother, and all my friends! But let God be to you, and
them all in all!" Going to disrobe, and prepare himself for the
block,' I thank God," said he, "that I am no wise afraidof death, nor am I daunted with any terrors; but I do as
cheerfuLlly lay down my head at this time, as ever I did when
going to repose.' With one blow was a period put to his life
by the executioner on the twelfth of May, 1641.
Thus died, in the forty.ninth year of his age, the earl of
Strafford, one of thlle most emiinent personages that has appeared in England.-After the Restoration, the bill of attainder was reversed: and even a few weeks after his execution, the Parliament remitted to his children the more severe consequences of his sentence.--The earl of Strafford's
Letters were published in two volumes folio, in 1739, by Dr.
William Knowler.
SWIFT, Jonathan,-a celebrated political and miscellaneous writer, was born in 1667. He-received his education in
Ireland; and afterwards i'esided for some years in the family of sir William Temple, his first patron. He took an active part in politics; and wrote much on political subj&amp;ctso
In 1713, he obtained the deanery of St. Patrick's in Ireland;
where he chiefly resided during.the remainder of his days.
He had, from early youth, been subject to fits of giddiness and
deafness; but some years befose his death, his mnemory declined, and he fell into a dreadful state of mingled imbecility and madness, accompaniedg at times, by much bodily suffering. He died at St. Patrick's, on the twventy-ninth of ()ctober5174,, in the seventy-eighth year of his age.1.f6       BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES.
His writings, generally speaking, can scarcely be considered favourable to the interests of religion and morality: many-passages in them, both in prose and verse, are highly objectionable, and offensive to delicate and pious minds. Conciseness and correctness are the distinguishing characteristics of his style.
His letters, of which a large collection is contained in his
own works, and in Pope's Epistolary Correspondence, exhibit, in general, a very unamiable character. Many of them
are disgraceful to his memnory; and it were to be wished,
for the honour of humanity, that his epistolary correspondence had not been drained to the dregs. "Of his general
habits of thinking," says Dr. Johnson, "if his Letters can be
supposed to afford any evidence, he was Inot a man to be either loved or envied. He seems to have wasted life in discontent, by the rage of neglected pride, and the languishlment
of unsatisfied desire.  He is querulous and fastidious, arrogant and maligiant: he scarcely speaks of himlself but with
indignant lamentati6ns, or of othlers but with insolent sutperiority whien hle is gay, and with angry contempt when he is
gloomy." His fine consolatory letter to the earl of Oxford,
on the death of his daughter, (which is inserted in this volume,) seems to have been writtenr in onie of his best moments,
and is worthly of a better man.
TALBOT, Catharine,-grand daughtcr of Dr. Talbot,
bishop of Durham, and niece of the lord chancellor Talbot,
was born in London, in the year 1721. She was the only
child of Mr. Edward Talbot, who died five monthls before her
birth. T'o his recommendation to his father, the bishop of
Durham, Dr. Secker, (afterwards archbishop of Canterbury,) was indebted for hiis first preferments; and he repaid
t.le obligation by the most constant and kind attention to Mr.
Talbot's widow and daughter. On his marriage, in 1725,
with the sister of the good and pious Dr. Benson, bishop of
Gloucester, miss Catharine Benson, who, from motives of
friendship, lived withi Mrs. Talbot, he invited her and her
infant daughter to reside in his family. There, fromn the
time miss Talbot was five years old, they found, as she often
acknowledged with gratefuLl sensibility, a very comfortable
and pleasant home; and there they lived, with great satisfaction and contentment, till the archbishop died, in the year
1768. By his will, he made a handsome provision for them:B10 RA PHICAL NOTICES&amp;                      7
Mrs. Talbot, after his death, took a house in Lower Gros~
venor stceet; where miss Talbot spent,her last days. She
did not long suirvive tier kind, paternal friend and benefactor.
Shle hiad never hadt good health; and for three years before
her death, she was-afflicted with a cancer. She bore all her
suffeirings with great patience and resignation. Her milnd
was supported with religious hope and consolation. One day
a short timre before her decease, when she was expecting almiost immediate dissolution, her countenance and deportment9
as one of her attendin-g friends observed, indlicatedl not only
cheerfulness but joy. She said, "she had that feeling within her, which spoke her happiness near."  On the ninth of
January, 1770O, she tranquilly expired, in the forty-ninth year
of her age.
Miss Talbot was highly accomplished, and elegant in her
person and manners. She possessed a verty amiable and truly feminine chlaracter: a calmn but fervent piety; a tender
attachment to hler friends; a kind and unremitting solicitude to relieve the wants, and encourage the good. con(luct,
of the poor; a great relish, and an earnest dlesire, for intellectual pleasures, but always in subservience to every domestic duty, and every office of humanity, tbat came within
the sphere of her allottedl action; and all the noble qualities
of her mind, and her fine accomplishments, were beautifully
shaded by mnodesty, humility, and gentleness.-After her
death, her writings, consisting of "Reflections on thlle seven
days of the week," and some other pleasing and edifying little pieces, were published bj her niuch endeared fiend, Mrs.
Carter. Hier Correspondence with that lady, together with
other letters of Mrs. Carter,' has recently been published, in
four volutmes octavo. MIiss Talbot's letters, and all her
writings, are worthy of her sensible, pious, and affectionate
mind
TEMPLE,. sir W~illiam,-a celebrated statesman and author, was the son of sic William Temnple, master of the rolls

elegant retirement; and died at his seat of Moor Park in Surrey, in the year 1700.
His prillcipal works are: "Memoirs," containing an account of his public employments; "Observations on the Netherlands;" and " Miscellanies," which,show considerable
depth of thoughlt, and convey the result of his valuable experience and accurate reflection on many useful and important
subjects.-His letter to lady Essex, which is inserted in this
volume, is justly considered a master-piece of tender reproof
and friendly admonition.
TILLOTSON, Johln,-archbishop of Canterbury, was born,
in the year 1630, at Sowerby near Halifax, in Yorkshire.
After passing through various stages of preferment in the
church, he was advanced in 1691, to the archiepiscopal dignity, or rather compelled to accept it, by kin~g William the
thiird, who highly respected his great merit. He (lied on
the twenty fourth of Novemnber, 1694.
The character anld conduct of this distinguished prelate,
were highly exemplary. He promoted the interests of religion with great zeal and ability, and,-at the same time, with
great prudence, moderation, and integrity. In his domestic
relation, he was mild and gentle, kind, obliging, and affectionate. He was so liberal and humrnane, that, even while he
wvas in a private station, he appropriated two-tenths of his
inlcome to charitable purposes. He was much inveighed
against by the enemies of the Revolution, and by many other
persons. Yet all the injurious treatment which he receivedfroom them, and all the caiulmnies which they spread
against him, though utterly false, could not provoke him
to the least act of revenge, or even to any expression of anger or malice. After his (leathi, there was found among hlis
papers, a bundle of bitter libels against him, on which he had
Ywritten with his, own hand, this inscription: "I forgive the
author of these books; I pray God tlihat he also may forgive
them.".r, T'Iillotson's Sermons have been translated into several
languages; and they are still hleldt in hiigh estimation. Bishop

of extraordinary genius and learning, was the sonI of a respectable attorney at Newark, where he was born, on the twenty
fourth of Decemb)er, 1698. He lost his father when he was a
a child; and remainlled under the care of his mother, an ex
cellent woman, for whom he always entertained the tender.
est affection and highest respect. As soon as his school edlication was fintished, he was ptt clerk to an attorney in Nottinghamshire. But on the expiration of his clerkship, his
thirst for general knowledge, and his ardent love of literature, together with the seriousness of his temper and the
purity of his morals, induced his friends-to yield to his inclination of taking nrders; which he did in 1723, having, with
the kind assistance of his cousin, the rev. William %Varburton, prepared himself for it with great assiduity and success'. In 17U8, he was presented, by sir Robert Sutton, to
the rectory of Brand-Broughton, in the diocese of Lincoln;
where he resided about twerty years, pursuing his studies
with intense application, arnd dclevoting all the time that could
be spared friom the duties of his parish, to reading and writing. In 1746, lie accepted, in consequence of the unanimous
offer of thle society of Lincoln's Inn, the office of their
preacher. About the same period, hle married miss Gertrudle
T''ucker. From the time of his marriage, he residedl chiefly
at Prior Park, near Bath, the hospitable mansion of Mr. Allen, his wife's uncle.
In 1760, Dr. Warhurton was advanced to the bishopric of
Gloucester. Mr. Pitt (afterwards lord Chathamn) observed
on the occasion, " that nothing of a private nature, since he
had been in office, had given him so much pleasure,. as his
bringing Dr. Warburton uponi the bench."-Some years before the bishop's death, his health visibly declined; and his
memory and all his other faculties, were much imlpaired,
though they were never wholly disabled. He expir,ed in the
episcopal palace at Gloucester, oni tb-e seventlh of Julne 1779~
in the eighty-first year of his age.
His most celebrated work is his "'Divi.ne Legation of
M(rses demonlstrated;" which is thus characterized by his
friendl and biographer, bisihop Hurcld:' A work, in all viewst
of the most transcendenit merit, whether we consider the in.
vention, or the execution. A  plain, simple argument, yetperfectly new, proving the divinity of tlhe Mosaic Laws. and320          BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES
laying a sure foundation for the support of Christianity, is

so elegantly connected, that the rea(lder is carried along it
with ease and pleasure; while the mnatter presen'ted to himn

lively fancy, and illustrated, from a1 quarters, by exquisite
learning and the most ingenious disquisition, that,' in th.e
whole compass of modern or ancient theology, there is nothinig equal or similar to this extraordinary performanice."
The othler works of Dr. WVarburton, are chiefly: "'rhe Alliance between Churcli and State;" " Juilia,n, or, A discourse
conccriniig that empeor'"s attempt to rebuild the temple at
Jerusalem;" " Sermonls on the principles of natural anid revealed religion, preached at Liicoln's Iinn; and a " View
of lord Bolinbroke's Philosophy."-His epistolary correspon(ldence with bishop Hurd, entitled " Letters from a late eminent prelate to one of'Liis frie1nds," hlzs recently oe,:n published, in one volume octavo; and a considerable nutimber of
his familiar letters is contained in the volume etitilecd' Letters to and from Dr., DoddriAge," edited by the rev. Mr.
Stedman.
Bishlop Hurd in describing the character of this truly great
man, says: " He had an arlden,t love of virtue, acnd a sincere zeal for religion. He venerated the civil constitution of hiis country, and was warmly attached to the
churchl of England. Yet he was no partyman, anid was a
sincere advocate for toleration.-A  perfect honesty of mind,
and an unfeigned love of truth, governed his pen in all his.
religious inquiries. In one of his letters to me, he says:' I
only aim at the honour of GOD, and the good of men. When
I say this I need not perhaps add (as I do with the utmost
seriousness) that I shall lnevNer wittingly advance one falsehood, nor conceal or disguise one truth.'-Iu private with his
friends, he was natural, easy, and unpretending; at once the
mrost agreeable and the most useful companion. His ready
wit and extensive knowledge afforded abundant entertainmnent and information. You saw to the very- bottomi of his
mind on any subject of discourse; and his various literature~

conversation, he had passed through the world with fewer
enemies; and with a temper less irritable, he would have
secured more enjoyment of himself. But these were the imperfections of his nature, or rather the excrescences of his ruling virtues, an uncommon frankness of mind, and sensibility of
heart. These qualities appear in all hiis writings, especially in his private letters; in which a warm  affection for his
friends, and concern for their interests, are every where ex-.
pressed; but his tenderness for his family, and, above all,
his filial piety, strike us with peculiar force.-IHe excelled
in epistolary composition; for which he was indeed singularly qutralified by the characteristic virtues both of his head
and heart."

only walked by it, and( looked upon it. T'he climate
is remarkably mild at Southampton, even in October
and November. No snow has been seenr to lie there
for these thirty years past. The myrtles grow in tihe
ground against the houses; and Guernsey lilies bloom
in every window. The town, clean and well-built,
surrounded by old stone walls with their towers and
gateways, standa at the point of a peninsula; and opens
futll south to an arm of the sea, which, having formied
two beautiful bays on eachl hand, stretchies away in
direct view, till it joins the Britishl Channel. it is
skirted on either side wmithi gently-rising grounds,
clothied withl thick wood; and directly cross its mouth,
rise the higlh linds of the Isle of Wight at a distance;
but distinctly seen.10         DESCRIPTIVE LETTERS.

affords a level and lawny walk, of about a hundred and
fifty yards' extent before it descends. The summit overlooks that stupendous Middleton, or, more properly,
Eyam dale, so well known to those whlo make excursions tfrom Buxton. Tliis dlale is narrow, and the vast

pensile and horrent icicles. The towers and turrets
of these lofty rocks are, however, continually growing less and less distinct, picturesqute, and noble.
They are broken and ravaged from time to time, for
thle purposes of building, and of making and mending
roads; and by the perpetual consumption of the everburning limte- kilns.''Thle middle part of our long-extended village, stands
on the brink of a d(lell, which has different and softer
features. It is deep, abrupt, and rocky, still narrower than the savage dale, but grassy and sylvan, the

straggling uut-tree, the alder, an(l the mountain ash.
Thie bottom is scarcely five yard(s wide, so immediately rise the perpelmicul]ar rocks on the opposite side,

It was neithler the proper season of the year, nor the
time of the day, to hear all the rural sounds, and to see
all the objects, mentioned in this description: but, by
a pleasing concurrence of circumstances, we were saluted on our app)l)roach to the village, with the music of
the mnower and( his sithle; we saw thle ploughman intent upon his labour, and the milk-maid returning
ifrom hler country employment.
As we ascendled the hill, the variety of beautiful objects, the agreeable stillness and natiural simplicity of
the whole scene, gave us the highest pleasure. At
lengthi, we reachied the spot, whence Milton undoubtedly took most of his images: it is on the top of the
hill, fromt wlichi there is a most extensive prospect on
all si(les. lThe distanit mountains that seemed to support the clouds; the villages and turrets, p)artly shaded with trees of the finest verdure, and partly raised
above the groves that suirrounded tlhemn; the dark
plains and meadows of a grayish colour, whiere the
sheep were feed(ling at large; in short, thie view of the
streams and rivers, coinvinced us that there was not a

And if men listen, and conf':;rm, to ti-he voice of affliction, it has done its errand; and it will either leave

I am nowv on the shady side of three-score years. I

I should not discharge the trust of a fatier. And if
you do not thankfully receive my admlonitions, you

Dear chil(ren,
I tlhank God I caime well to Farrington this d(lay, about five o'clock. And as I htave some

wn satisfaction an(l yolr benefit, thanr, by a letter, to

evil that befalls persons, atises ftroin tle wvell or ill
managing of thieir conversation. Wheni I liave leisure and opportunity, I shall give yotu my directions
oni other sulbjects.
Never speak alny thing fr a  truth which you know,
or believe, to be false. Lyiwg is a great sin against
God, who gave us a tongue to speak the truth, andi not
falsehllood. It is a great offence against humlianity itself: for, where there is no regardtl to truthtl, there cat
be no safe society between man and man. And it is
an injury to the speaker: for, besides the disgrace
which it brings upon him, it occasions so muclh b)aseness of mind, that he can scarcely tell truthl, or avoid
lying, even when he has no colour of nlecessity for it;
and, in time, lie comes to such a pass, that as other
people cannot believe lie speaks truthl, so lie himself
scarcely knows when he tells a falsehood.
As you must be careful not to lie, so you must avoid
coming near it. Youl must not equivocate; nor speak
any tliing positively for wlichl you have no authoritys
but report, or conjecture, or opinion.
Let your words be few, especially whlen youtr superiors, or strangers, are present, lest you betray your
own weakness and folly; anld rob youtrselves of the
opportunity whlich you might othlerwise hlave hlad, to
gain knowledge, wis(ldomn, andl experienlce, by hearing
those, whomn you silence l)y your impertinent talking.
Be not too earnest, 1ol(, or violenit, in your comlversationll. Silenlce your )opIMnent, withtl reason, not
with noise.
Be careful not to interrupt another, whlen he is
speaking; hlear im olut, and( you VHill understand himi
tile bet;ter, an(l be able t(o give himi thIe better answer.
Consider before you speak, especially wlhen the but
siness is of momnent; weig1l tile sense of whlat you
mnean to uttLr, and the exprlessions you intend to ise,
tlhat th-ey nmay be siniilicant, pertinent and inoiensive(,

Inconsiderate persons do not think till they speak; or
they speak and( then think.
Some men excel in hlusbandry; some in gardening;  
some in lmathlematics. In conversation, learn, as near
as you can, whiere the skill ori excellence of any person lies; put him upon talkiing on that subject, observe-what lie says, keep it in youtr mell o y, orn (o!to
mit it to writing: by this eicans, you will glean tihe
worth and knowledge of every bodly you converse
withl; and, at an easy rate, acquire wlvat nmay be of
use to you on man,y occasions.
Whien you are in company with light, vi, ilnT p)ertinent persons, let the olbserving- of their tflilings, make

If any one, wlhom you do not know to b)e a person

be not too ready to believe or report them; atd(l yet

too forward to contradict him. If thle occasion requires you to dleclare your opinion, do it modestly and
gently, not bluntly nor coarsely; by this means you
will avoid giving offence, or ieingabised for toomuclh
c'redulity.
If a man, whose integrity you do not very well know,

Dear son,
1Though on account of the contagiousness
of your disease, and thlle llany depen(lants I hlave upon
me, I thouglht it not convenient to comie to you during
yotur sickness, yet I have not been wanting in my
earnest prayers to Almighlty God for you, nior in utseing the best means I could for your recovery.
It has pleased God to hlear my prayers for you, and
to restore you to collmpetenlt (legree of health; for
wlhicht I returnjim mny hlumble and hearty thanks.] would have you, as long as you live, re1member your
late sic(kness in all its circtumstances, and the p)lain- and
profitable inferences that arise from it.  Whlile afflictions continue, and whlile deliverances are firesh, they
commonly I)ave somle goo(d effect upon us. Butit as the
iron is no sooner out of the fire, tflihan it returns to its
old coldness lnd lhardness: so wlhen the afflictiont and
deliveranice are past, we usually tbrget tlhem, otr attribute themt to means aind secoindary causes; trie good
that we should receive froil tihem vanishes; aind we
become whlat we were before. Sick-bed promises are
often forg':tten when thle sickness is over.
Let it be your first business, after your recovery,
to considler the cmurse of your past life, since you. came
to thle age of'f discretion, and see what has been. amiiss
in it: whctlher you lhave not too much neglected religion, a1nd its duties; been gutilty of intemperance, and

one of the greatest blessings that ever befell you.
Keep the fear of God constantly in your heart; rememlber that hle always sees and notices you; and ordler your life as in his presenIce.
Frequently and thlankfully consider the great love
of God, in Jestis Christ; whom lie hlas given to be the
instructer, and governfor, and sacrifice for the sins, of
you an(l of all mnankind; and thlroughl whom, upon relpentance, you hiave assurance of forgiveness, and of
eternal life. And consideir how great an engagement

Every (lay, rea(l the iHoly Scripture. Observe it
well; read( it reve rently and attentively; set your
heart up)Oll it; lay it 111) in your min;iory; and make
it thle direction of your life. I have been acquainted
w,ith mcie and books, and I hiave had long experience
in learning, and in the world. And I can assure you,
there is no book like the Bible for excellent learning, wisdoinm, a(nd uI-se; and( it is want of understanding
in those who tihink or speak otlherwise.
Ever~y morning and evening, with all reverence and
attention of mil(l, return hlearty thanks to God for his
m-ercy to you, and particul.arly for this late deliverance; (lesire his grace to enable you to walk, in some
nmeasure, answerably to it; and imlplore his I)ardon
fOr youLr sins.
Observe conscientiotisly the Lord's day to keel) it
holy; avoid recreations, andl secular employmenls and
discourse, on that d(lay; resort twice to thle )public
worshllip; go early to it, be attentive at it, likeep your
eyes an1d minid frtom roving after vain tlhoughlts or objects; and spend the rest of the day, that is free from
necessary avocations, in reading the Scriptures, and

resigtn some of those religious advantages, which you
have long enljoyed, shle has been urgent with me to put
something into your hlald, whichl may be reviewed
whlenever you please; aIl(l whichl, by the-Divine blessing, may be useful to yout, as being peculiarly suited
to your present circulnstances.
On- my part, Imadamt, I undertake flie task with a
gre'at deal of clicerf'ulness; not only to oblige hler, who
is mly valuable friend, hut withl sol11e ellcouraging
hop(l)e, that it imay be sericceable to you. I hlave had
many alnxious tlloulits about you, since your miothler
anld I talke(l of you; so that yout aInd your affairs a!e
g0,town very fitmiliar to my mind, and I begin to enter
into telmi with sonmething of a Il)iOter'S affection.
I lhope this concer.n will sufficiently justify a plainness, whicht, in sucli a case, becomies ahlmost unavoidable; aind I persuade nmyself, madlam, that whlien you
consider it as proceeding from suich a principle, you
will not be offen(led, thlough I tell you that I almost
treinille to thlink of tlhe variety of dangers to wlhichl you
are going to be exl)posed. I am young myself: yet I
lave already learned by too frequent experience, that,
in the morning of life, wve natlrally delu(lde ourselves
witlh pleasing dreamss; we fix our eyes on whlat is
miost d(leligltful in a dlistant lprospect; but eithler entirely overlook whlat is dangerous and threatening, or
at mlost bestow only a transielnt glance uponI it. You
think, no doubt, witlh a great deal of pleasure, of seeing a variety of new objects inl a fine coluntry, vastly
(lifferent fromn our owvn; especially of meeting a brothler, wlom you hlave never yet seen, but who, at so
remote a distance, has expressed( the tenderest regard
for yoLu. And you are charmed with tlhe prospect of
meeting hirn, in a place wvlere he knows not any superior; of sharing with himn in his plenty anld magnificence; and of being treate(l by all about you withl
the respect due to a governtor's sister. I own there is
somnething very splendid (iandl striking in suchl a view,

entreat you, madam, to consider that it is possible you
may never reach thlle country whlich is to be the scene
of so many entertainments. There are unknowln hazards in a voyage to the In(lies. Before you have
perfobrmed hlalf of it, some unexpected event may put
a period to tlhese 1iopes, and to your life. Or, if you
reach, it is certain that dangers will attend
you there; dangers wlhich will be so much the greater
as you are the less sensible of them. Our India governors live in a kind of princely grandeur ai(nd magniilcenlce; so that you will really need almost as muchi
wisdom and goodness as if you were going to coultrt.
You will see a great deal of vanity and pomp, and no
doubt a great deal of tluxury too, if not in the governor himself, (of whom I hear a very respectable character,) yet in some of his retinlue. You will lhear a
great deal of flattery, the shame of our sex, and the
rutin of yours; and the dangers, which conceal the
sharpest and the most fatal stings, are those wl-hich
will accost yout with the softest air and the most smiling countenance.
Whlen I consid(ler these thlings, I am very solicitoils
withl regard to the end of thlem; and I plainly confess,
I cannot but think, that, humanly speaking, there is a
great deal of reason to fear lest the lovely flower,
which is now opening with so much beauty and fragrancy, shlould be blasted by too warm a sun, and witlier in that luxurious soil to whichl it will be trauslplanted..Or, in plainer terms, I fear, (what God forbid!) that the impression of a religions education will
xvear off from yotur mnind; and the vain alluremlnents of
an ins;:aring world will po)ssess tlhemnselves of your
lIeart, till, by insensible degrees, your virtue may be
endanllgered, and youlr soul ruined. I say not these
things, niadam, to (lissutade you from the voyage. BIt
I represent tlie case in all its dangerous circumstances, as far as I apprehend them,l that you may be
awakened to a proper care in providing against them.

Therefore, my first advice is, that before you begin
thllis important and doubtful voyage, you set youtirself
repeatedly to examine into the state of your souil, withl
regard to God and eternity. It would be doinig you a
great deal of wrong to suppose you are ignorant of tihe
condition in which the Gospel fouind us, and of that
illto which it is intended to bring us. You know the
original claiim of God utpon us, and how far the most
innocent anud virtiuouis of us have been from answering
it exactly in all its extent. You know something of
the fatal consequences, which would have attenrded
that revolt, had God treated us with rigorous severity;
thoughil none know themin in their full terror. You are
acquainted with the-gracious methol he has taken of
recovering us, by a Redeemer, from the ruin of the
apostacy, anid the way in whiichi the invaluable bless~
ings of the everlasting Covenant are now offered to
our accepfance. Let it be your immediate and diligent
inquiry, whethier you h1ave fallen in with this merciful
proposal; alnd have resolutely and entirely devoted
yourself to God, with a lhumble depenidence on the
merits of his Son for your acceptance, and tllhe assistanice of his good Spirit to form you to a holy temper,
and animate you to tile zealous discharge of all the
duties which hle requiires of you. If you hliave not yet

soberness, but will, through the whole of his mninistry and conversation, be aninmated by a deep and
lively sense of religion, an ardent zeal for the hlionourof God, and a tender concern for the salvation of
souls. But if it should happen otherwise, endeavour to
make the be,st of what you hear; and carry a few good
books with you, which, by the blessing of God. may
in part make up'for the want of more suitable public
assistances. You may thlen have an opportunity of

all, I would most earnestly entreat you to make the
Scriptures very familiar to you. It is by these that
thle young mlay cleanse thir way; and, in the morntof life, be formed upon maxims of the best and the
mostimportant wisdom. David's Psalms, Solomon's
Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, and the whole of the New
T'estament, are the parts of Scripture which I
would especially recomnmetnd; an(l I would entreat
you to read them, not in a hasty and cursory manner,
but with deep reflection, and earnest prayer to God
for the assistance of his Spirit in the study of themn:

a beauty and a glory in tllem, beyond( wlhat the generality of the worldl apprehend. This guide alone is
incomparably preferable to all the books and the

Dear Madam,
You are now going fir om the company,
thle conversation,. and thle amusements of children,
into a scene of life whlichll afford(ls more rational pleasures, and whicih will engage you in more important
pursuits. Tlhe world is opening before you; a wil
derness in whichAt many have been lost, and in which,
among a thousand broad ways, therc is but one nlarrow patl thlat leads to h.appiness andl honour-. It is of
great consequence to you to he directed into tlhis
path at first; for if you slould miss it at setting out,
you will lind great difficulty in recovering it.--I hlope
you will be long under the protecetion and( guidance
of parents. in wlhomn there is all tha~ can be wishied
in the relation; yet miy affection for you i(nduces n.e
to give you a few plain instructions, which, I trust,
wvill assist you in fulfilling your dduty to themi. in oIhtaining the good wvill of others, and in promuotiIng
yourl own welfare.
Do not imagine tlhat I think you inclined to every
fault and folly tlhat I slht:l warn you against: but you

to do any thing in favour of one pet-son, at tle expense of another, or of yourself.
Therle are many acts of kindness to mankind in
general. which are neither (difficult. trouhblesomne, nor
expensive.''lThe principal of these is, speaking well,
ov at least not speaking ill, of the absent. If you
see a fault in another. (1o not make it the sutlject of
conversation. Do not thintk yourself justified by
saying, that what you reporlt to another's (lisadvantage is true. If'all the rea l'ailings oft' the best of us,
wer'e to be told to outr dearest frien(ld. perhaps all otiur
virtues could scarcely secure his esteem. Butt this
r'ule must not extend to the concealing of any thing
by wlhi(chl anothler may be injitired in liis )property or
character, if b)y revealing it the evil may be p)'evented; and tis is almost thlie only instance in which we
are allovwed( to speak of the faults of others.

is often taken lol' contempt, or at least for want of
esteem; and( I hfLave known the onmitting to return a

witl colidniess, indifference, and( worse conseqluenees.
That piersons ouglht nlot to set stueh a value on these
trifles, is trute; but, i' they do, it behoves us to act
confoItrmably. However, as the resenting of a lbreach
of' these punectilios is really a fault, take care that
you are not betrayed into it. Mere negligences
should hbe below your resentmnent; though, for thle
sake of the infirm;ities of othiers, you slhould guard

Remenmber, that wlhoever makes professions of
friendshlip which are not sincere, is a hypoerite; an(i
beware that your own vanity (loes not encourage you
to think that you ha;e merite(d uncownivon and, excessive instances of favour, and zeal to serve you.
But the constant, steady esteemn an(I friendshlip of a

Never be trusted( withl the secrets of othiers, if yot,

it to many othiers: at lenfgth, it is betrayed; and(. as
this bi)leach of faithi is always denied by thle guilty,

that you slhould treat them courteously, b,ut permit no

probably do you more harm, than any thinig whichl

in the management of the househol( affairs, use it with
moderation, and give orders rather in hler name than

to assume command, or to value yourself upon it.
If your father or mother shlould at any time express
a disapprobation of your coinduct, immediately resolve
to amend it, apologize for the lIast, and promise for the
future; never seenm in hlaste to justify yourselfL Even
if you slhould thiink that tlhe displeas ure of your parents

will be mistaken,) be sure to avoid, on the one ha'nd,

discontent  and, as the reward of a contrary co.nduct,
their own reflections upon whlat is past, whlen their
minds are calmn, will be in your favour; and their af-kfection will seek an opportunity of compensating your
uneasiness. You shouild regard thlese accidents as opportunities of endearing yourself to thlem, and as tests
if your prudence, duty, and affection. Whlat may not
children expect from a father, whlo is a friiend to tihe
whole circle of his acquaintance? It is youtir lap)iness
to have sucht a father: think youirself secure, from Ihis
affection, of every thing that is fit for you, an(l ldo not
anticipate his boanity by your requests. Bothl his pleasurte and youtrs will be lessened, if you receive because

(How very shameful, then, is tle common triumphl of
favou ites, tfor having obtained by importunity what is

that a noble mind will dispose a person to suffer' mnuch,
rather thaln ask a favour which he knows cannot be
refused, if hle thinks that his frienld may have reason
to wislh it lad not been asked.
I shall finish this long letter with some advice of yet
hi;her imporltance.--Il' you succeed in evwry (lesigolwhiclh ylou foinr, anid thie world(l favour you,I till its litnost l)bounty is cxhatlusted, 7yourI hapiniess wvill be still
imperfect: you will find some desire unsatisfied; and
possessionwill never fill yotir wishies. But (lo Iiot sLffer the present 1hour to pass away unenjoyed, by an
earnest and anxious (desire of' somne futuire good: for,
ift this weakniess be in(lutilged, your ha1ppiness will still
fly from you as you patrsue it; and there will be the
same distance between yout and thlie object of yotr
wishes, till all the visions of imagination shall vaniish,
and your progress to ftirther degrees of temnporal advantage shlall be stol)ped by the grave. It is notwithstanding true, that the expectation of fuiture good, if
thie object is worthy of a rational desire, pleases more
than any present enjoyment. You will, therefore, find
tlhat a well-groundedl hope of Heaven will give a relishl
to whiatever you shlall possess upon earthl. If tiere is
no fuiturity, that we can anticipate withl pleasure, we
regret every momenIt that passes; we see that timne is
flying away with all our enjoyments; that youthi is
short, health precarious, and age approaclhing, loaded(
withl infirmnities to whlichl death only can put an end.
For this reason, endeavour to secure an interest in
the favour of God, whichl will ensurIe to yout an everlasting life of uninterrupted and inconceivable felicity.
Nor is thlis a difficult or an unpleasing attempt; no
real present happiness needs be forfeited to purchlase
the future: for virtue and piety at once secure every
blessing, both in time and eternity.PIRECEPTIVE LETTERS.

IMy dear nephew,
Your letter from Cambridge affords
me many very sensible pleasures. First, that you are,
at last, in a proper place for study and improvement,
instead of losing, in London, any more of that most
precious thiing, tinie. Secondly, that you seem pleased withlthle particular society you are placed in, and
wit}l tlhe gentleman to whose care and instruction yout

right sense, and( the love of virtue, whiclt appear
through your whole letter.
You are already possessed of the true clute to gui(le
you thlrough the years of education, in the maxim you
lay down, namely, that the use of learning is, to render a man more wise and virtuous, not merely to nmake
himn more learned. Go on, my dear boy, by this golden rule, and you cannot fail to become every thilng
that your hreart prompts you to wish to be, and tlhat
minie mlost affectionately wishes for you. There is but
one dan,ger in your way; and( that is, perhal)s, natutral

of close application and laborious (liligence. With the

If you do not rise early, you never can make any progress worth mentioning. If you do not set apart your
hours of reading; if you suffer yourself, or any one
else, to break in upon them; your days will slip
throiugi your hliands, unprofitably and frivolously, utnpraised by all you wish to please, and really unenjoyed( by yourself. Be assured, whatever you take from
pleasure, amusements, or indolence, for these first few
years of your life, will repay you a hundred fold, in tihe
pleasures, honours, antd advantages, of all the remainder of youtr days.--You are to qualify yourself for the
part in society, to which you are called by your birthi
and estate. You are to be a gentleman of such leariiing and accomplishments, as mnay hereafter distinguish
you in the service of your country; not a pedant, who
reads only to be called learned, instead(l of considering
learning as an instrument of action.
I hlave not the pleasure of knowing the gentleman
vwho is your tutor; but I dare say he is every way
equal to such a charge, which I think no small one. I
hope he will concur with me, as to the course of study
I desire you may begin with; and that sucl-h booliks,

If any thing, my dear boy, could( have happened, to

in age an(l knowledge: namely, to be a patient, attentive, and well-bred lhearer, at(nd to answer with modesty; to deliver your own opinion spatiingly, and with

from  approving such taciturnity. But I highly re.
commend the intent of Pythlagoras's injunction:
whichl is, to ldedicate the first parts of life to hear

which to form well-founded opinions, and sound prineiples; ani not to l)e presuming, prompt, and flippant, in hazarding slight, crude notions of things,
and, by that means, expose the nakedness of the

mients, for,their reception and entertainment. And
not only will this Idisgrace ollow from such temerity
and prestumption, but a more serious danger is likely to ensue; which is, time embraein.g of errors for
tlitlhs, prejudices foi principles; and wlhen that is
once do3ne, tCle a(clteming to them, onlly because one

of the understlanding aind the conscience to a yoke of

but I thoughlt it not amniss to offer these reflections to
your inind.
As to your manner of behaving towards the unhappy young gentlemen you describe, let it be manly and
easy; decline their parties withl civility; retort their
raillery withl raillery, always tempered with.good
breeding. If they banter your regutlarity, order,
decency, aind love of study, banter, in return, the opposite qualities in the in; and venture to owvn frankly,
that you camIe to Cambridge, to learn whlat you can,
inot to follow what they call pleasure.
I conme now to the part of the advice I have to offer you, which most nearly concerns your welfare,52      PRECEPTIVE LETL'ERS.
and upon which every good and hlonourable purpose
of your life will assuredly turn; I mnean the keeping up in your heart true sentiments of religion. If
you are not righlt towards God, you can never be so
towards man. The noblest feeling of the human
heart is here brought to the test. Is gratitude in
the number of a mian's virtues? If it is, the highest
Benefactor demands the warmest returns of gratitude, love, and praise. If a man wants this virtue',
where there are infinite obligations lo excite and
quicken it, he will be likely to want all others towards his fellow-creatures; whlose utmost gifts are
poor, compared to those which he daily receives at
the hands of his never failing Almiglhty Friend.
" Remember thy Creator in the days of' thly youth,"
is a maxim big with the deepest wisdlom. "' Thle fear
of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;" and" to.
depart friom evil is understanding." rThis is eternally true, whether the wits and rakes of Cambridge
allow it or not; nay, I must add of this religious
wisdom, thlat," her ways are ways of pleasantness,
and all her paths are peace," whatever your young
gentlemen of pleasure think. Hold fast, therefore,
by this sheet-anchor of happiness, Religion: you
wiill often want it in the times of most danger; the
storms and( tempests of life. Cherish true religion;
shun, with abhorrence and contempt, superstition
and enthusiasm. The first is the perfection and glory, the two last are the depravation and disgrace, of
l'human nature. Reinemrer the essence of religion,
is,,' a heart void of offence towards God and man;"
not subtle, speculative opinions, but an active, vital
principle of faith.
Go ot, my dear child, in thle admirable dispositions
you have towards all that is right and good.-I hlave

It is to be wishedt thlat the female part of the hu.

" Many people, " says an ingenious writer, " lose a great deal,of time by reading: for they read absturd(l romances, where chlar
acters that never existed are insipidly displayed, and senltiments
that were never felt, are pomnpously described; and such sort of
idle, frivolous stutff, that nourishes and improves the mind, just as
much as wliipped cream would the body. Adhere to the best established books in every language; the celebrated poets, lhistorians, orators, and philusophers. By these means, (to use a city
metaphor,) you will make fifty per cent. of that time, of which
others do nlot make above tlhree or four, or probably nothing at all.
Lay down a methlod for your reading; and allot to it a certain
share of 3:our time. Let it be in a consistent and consecutive course
and not in that desultory manner, in which many people read
scrlaps of different authlors, upon different subjects.-Never read
history witlhoutt hlaving maps, and a chronological book or tables,
),ing by:y'u, and constantly recurred to; without vwhich, histoly
is a contlse(l heap of facts.-At your sparenoments, take u0) a

Dear sir,

withl your request, to give you somie hints conceriling

Our profession is generally ridiculed-as. being dIry
and tninteresting; butt a minid anxious for the dliscovery of tltutlh and information, willl be amply gratified
for tlle toil, in investigating ttle origin and progr-ess of
ajurispiudence, which hlas the good: of the peo)le for
its basis, and the accumuLlated wisdom andt experience

so intricate as hlas been imagilledl; especiallysince thle

A minute knowledge of the political revolutions, and of
the judicial decisions of our predecessors, whethler in

is equally useful and interesting. This wvill iniclu(Ie a

I would always recommend a diligent attend(ance on
the courts of justice; as by thlat means, the practice of
themn, (a circumstance of great moment,) willbe easily
andl naturally acquired. A tmuch stronger impression
will be made on the mindli of the statement of the case,
and the pleadings of the counsel, than by a cold, uninteresting detail of them, in a report. But above all,
a trial at hag-, or a special argument, should never be
neglected. It is usual on these occasions to take notes;  
a knowle(dge of shlort-hand will give such facility to
your labours, as to enable you to follow the most raiid speaker with certainty and precisionl. Commonplace books are convenient an(l useful; and as they
are generally lettereld, a referenice may be had tQ tlhemt

Whienever it p)leaseg God to appoint you to the government of a parisl, you will find work cnoutgll to einploy

thinking, if it is not acquired in the first p)art of life,
rarely comes afterwards.  For want of spiritual exercises, a 3man is miserably drawn into' the eddy of a
worldly dissipation, and knlows not how to get oult of
it again; the faculties of his soul are benumbed; and
lhe sinks into indolence, till " the itight colinethl, whlen

LETTER L.
Sir Wtlliami Temple to the countess of Essex.-OtOn the
excess of her grief occasioned by the loss of her only
daughter.
Sheen, Jan. 29, 1674.
The honour which I received by a letter from
your ladyshlip, was too great not to be acknowledged;
yet I doubted whethler that occasion could bear me out
in the confidence of giving your ladyship any further
tronlible. Butt I can no longer forbear, on account of
the sensible wounds that have so often of late been
given your firiends here, by the desperate expressions
in several of youtr letters, respecting your temper of
mindl, your hlealth, and your life; in all whlich, you
must allow them to be extremely concerned. Per-.
liaps none can be, at heart, more partial than I am to
whatever regar(Is your ladyship, nior more inclined to
defend you on this very occasion, how unjust and unki(nd soever you are to yourself. But when-you thlrow
away your health, or your life, so great a remainder
of your own family, and so great hlopes of that into
which you are entered, and all by a desperate minelanchloly, upon an event past remedy, and to whichl all
the mortal race is perpetually subject; give me leave
to tell you, madamn, that whlat you (do is not at all consistent either with so good a Chlristian, or so reasoni
able and great a person, as your ladyshlip appears to
tle world in all other lights.
I know no duty in religion more generally agreed
on, ntor more justly required.by God Almighty, than
a perfect submission to his will in all things; nIor do IADMONITORY LE TTERS.  
think any disposition of mind can either please him
more, or become us better, tllani that of being satisfied
with all he gives, and contented withl all he takes
away. None, I am sure, call be of more honour to
God, nor of more ease to ourselves. For if xveconsi.
der himtn as outr Maker, we cannot contend witlh hlil;
if as our Father, we ought not to distrust hlim: so that
we may be confident, whatever he does, is intenrded for
good: and whatever happens that we interpret otherwise, yet we can get nothingi by repining, nor save
any tl-hing by resisting.
But if it were fit for us to reason withl God Almighty, and your ladyship's loss wvere acknowledged as
great as it could have been to any one; yet, I doubt,
you would lhave but ill grace to complain at the rate
you have done, or rather as you do: for the first emnotions or passionIs, nmay be pardoned; it is only the
continutance of them whlichl makes themn inexcusable.
In this world, madamn, there is nothling perfectly good;
and whatever is called so, is but either comparatively
with other things of its kind, or else with the evil that
is mitngled in its composition; so, be is a good man
whlo is better tlhan men commonly are, or in whtom
the good qualities are more than the bad; so, in tlhe
course of litfe, his coindlition is esteemned good, which is
better than that of mnost othIer men, or in which the
goo(I circumstances are more than the evil.  By this
mneasure, I doubt, madam, your complaints otghlt to
le turned into acknowledgemnents, and youir fiiends
ouIld lIave cause to rejoice, rather thlan to condole,
withll youL. Wrhen yourt ladyship has faiiily considered
hlow God Almighty has dealt witl- yc,i in what he has
given, you may be left to jludge yoturself 1-how you have
(ldealt withi himl in yotr comnpllaints for wvliat ine has
taken away. If you look about you, a(nd consider
othler lives as well as yoturt own, and what your lot is,

ci-cle of your knowledge; if yo u think thow fe\w are

children, how little beauty we see, how fewv friends we
hear of, lhow imucih poverty, and how many diseases,
there are in the world; you will fall down upon your
knees, and, instead of repining at one affliction, will
admire so mriany blessinigs as you have received at tl-he
hand of God.
To put your ladyship in mind of whlat you are, and(
of tlhe a(lvantages which you lhave, would look like a
design to flatter you. But this I may say, that we will
pity you as much as you please, if you will tell uts who
they are whom you thilk, upon all circullmstfllancCs, youtt
have reason to envy. Now if I- had a imaster who gave
me all I could ask, but thoughlt lit to take one tiling
from mne again, eithler because I used it ill, or gave my
self so mucht over to it, as to neglect wihat I owed to
him, or to the world; or perhlaps because lie would
show his power, and putt me in mind from  hlom I held
all the rest: would you think I had much reason to
complain of hard usage, and never to remember any
more what was left me, never to forget what was-taken
away?
It is true, you hlave lost a child, and all that coutld
be lost in a chllild of that age; but you have kept one
child, and you are likely to do so long; you have the
assurance of anotlher, and the hopes of many more.
You have kept a husband, great in employment, in
fortune, and in thle esteem of good men. You have
kept your beauty and your htealth, unless you have destroyed tlhem yourself, or discouraged them to stay
with you by using them ill. You have friends who
are as kined to you as you can wish, or as you can
give them leave to be. You hIave hlonour and esteem
fiom all wlto know you; or if ever it fails in any degree, it is only upon that p)oint of your seeming to be
fallen out with God and the wlhole world, and neithler
to care for yotrsclf, nor any thling else, after whlat you
hlave lost.
You will say, perhaps, that one tlhing was all to
you, an(d your fonldnless of it madle you indifferent to
every thing else. But tlis,.1 dotlubt, will be so far

fromin justifying you, that it will prove to be your
fault, as wvell as your misfortune. God Almighty gave
you all thle blessinigs of life; and you set your lheart
wholly upon one, anid despise or undervalue all the
rest: is this his fault or yours? nay, is it not to be
very unthilankful to Heaven, as well as very scornful
to the rest of the world? is it not to say, because yout
have lost one thing God( has given, you thankhiim for
nothing hie has left, andl care not what lie takes away?
is it not to say, since that one thling is golne out of the
world, there is n,othling left in it wlhichl you think can
deserve your kindness or esteem? A friend makes me
a feast, and l)laces before me all that his care or kindness could p)rovi(le: but I set my lheart upon one dish
alone, and, if that happeils to be thrown downt, I scorn
-all the rest; and tlhough lie sends for another of the
samie kind, yet I rise from the table in a rage, and say;, MIy fiicnd is becomne mnly einemy, andl hlie has done
me the greatest wrong in the world." Have I reason, nmadlam, or good grace, in wvhat I do? or wvotil( it
)becomle me l)etter to eat of the rest that is before me,
and( thiiik no more of what had happened, and could
not be reme(lied?
Chlristianity teachles and( commands uts to moderate
our passioris; to teml)er our affections towar(ls all
things below; to be tlhankful for tlhe possession, and(
patient un(ler the loss wlhenever HE. who gave shall
see fit to take away. Yourt extreme fondness was perhaps as displeasing to God before, as now your extremne affliction is; and yotr loss may have been a

pretend to, and the best remedy we can apply to all our
misfortunes.
But, madlam, tlhough religion were no party inll your
Case, and, for so violent and injurious a grief, youl hadl
nothing to answer to God, but only to tlhe world and(
yourself; yet I very muchl doubt how you would be
acquitted. We bring into the world with ius a poor,
needy, uncertain life; short at the longest, and unquiet at the best. All the imaginationlls of the witty
and the wise have been perpetually busied to find out
tle ways to revive it withl pleasures, or to relieve it
with diversions  to compose it with ease, and settle
it With safety. To thlese ends have been employed
th-e institutioims of lawgivers, the reasonllings of philb
osophers, the inventions of poets, thle pain,s of labour-1
Ing, and tihe extravagances of voluptutous men. All:he world is p)erpetually at work that ourI poor mortai
lives may pass tlhe easier and hal)pier fotr thlat little
time we possess thenm, or else en(l the better when we
lose them. On this account, riches and honours are
coveted, friendshlip and love pursued, and the virtues
themlselves admired(1 in the world. Now, mnadam, is it
ot' to bid defiance to all mankind, to condemn their
universal opinions a(nd desiglins, if insteadl of passing
youir life as well and easily, you resolve to pass it as
ill and miserably, as you can? You grow insensible
to the conveniences of riches, thle deliglhts of honour
and praise, tlhe charmns of kindness or friendship, nay
to the observance or applause of virtues themselves ~
for. wlho can you expect, in these excesses of lpassions,
will allow that youI shIow eitihert temperance or fortitude, either I)ridence or jtlistice? and as for your
friends, I suippose you reckon upon losing tlheir kindness, wlhen you have sufficiently convinced thlem thley
can never hlope for any of yours, since you have none
left fbr yourself, or any tiling else.
Passions are, p)erhaps, the stings, witlhout which, it
is said, no honley is made. Yet I think all sorts otADMONITORY LETTERS     4
enl have ever agreedl, they oughlt to be our servants,
and not our masters; to give us some agitation for

at all. than to have them too violent; or suchI alone,
as, insteadt of' heiglhtenitlg our pleasures, afford( us nothing btt vexation and pain.
In all suLcli losses as your ladyship's hlas been, there
is soimething that comnmoni natutre cannot be denied  
there is a great deal tihat good nature may be allowed.
Butt all excessive and outrageous grief or lam-entation.fo,r the deadl, was accounteld, among the ancient Christians, to hlave somnetlhing Heathenishl; and, amnong the

fromt accusing your passion, that they would encourage it as much, a(nd shlare it as deelAy, as they could.
Butt, alas! the eterllal lawNs of the creation extinguish
all such hopes, forlbid all suchi designs; nature gives
us many chlildren and friends to take tlhem away, but
takes none away to give tlhem to us again. And this
makes thle excesses of grief to be universally condemned as iunnatutiral, because so much in vain; whereas

LETTER II.
Dr. Doddridge to Sir J.. On swearing.
Northampton, Dec. 8, 1742.
Dear sir,
Permit me frankly to speak my mind to you
oln a subject, on whicll I fear to be silent, lest I should
fail in a branch of duty and( gratitude to a gentleman,
to whomn I thlink myself obliged, and whom I would
gla(lly serve to the best of my little ability. Be not.angry, whlen I tell you, I was hleartily grieved( at the
liberties you took last night, in using the venerable
name of thle Ever Blessed God in so light a manner;
and in ti-he needless appeals which you made to himn, as
to things that would hlave been believed on muclh less
evidcnce,t1.an the word of Sir J.. I have not
lheard, for some years, so mucll of that kind of language, except when passing by people of low educacation, in thle streets whether it be owing to the complaisance with wlhiclh gentlemeni commonoly treat our
profession, or, as I rather hope, to a sense of what is
in itself reasonable and decent.
I ani sutre, sir, that your knowledge of men and
tlhings is capable of makintg conversation pleasant and
impro)ving, and of filling up your fuill sh-are in it without these dreadful expletives; for dreadful I must call
thelm, wlhen considlered withl a view to that strict accounllt whichi must certainly, and quickly, be rendlered
up to God for all our word(s, as well as our actions.
I was the minore solicitous, sir, to mnention thlis affair to
you, in consideration of your office as a magistrate;
the dignity of whlich must certainly be most effectually
supported by avoiding whatever it requires you to
punish in others. In this view, sir, permit mne to entreat youl to joia your efforts with those of all other
wise and, good men, to discountenance, anld, if possible, to drive out of the world, this unprofitable enormity. of swearing in common conversation; concern70         ADMONITORY _LETTERS.
ing the evil of which, I am sure it is not necessary to
enlarge, wliei ad(ldressing myself to a gentlemani of
good( understanding.
Iconclutde, sir, with my most affectionate wishes and
prayers for you, that thie whole of your coniduct, in
every circumstance of life, may be suchl as will yield
the most pleasing reflections in the awful hour of
death, and the mlost comfortable account before the
Divine tribunal to which we are hastening: and in tihe
serious views of which, I hIave presumed to give you
this trouble, hoping youI will esteem it, as it undoubtedly, is, a proof that I am with great sincerity, sir,

Rev. James I&amp;rvey to Richard X.ash, esq.*--On a life
otf sinfal pleasure.
Sir,
This letter comines firom your sincere friend,( and
one who has your best interest (leeply at heart; it
comes on a (Iesign altogethier important, and of no less
consequence than your everlasting happiness: so that
it may justly challenge your attentive regard. It is
not to utpbraid or reproach, much less to triutimpl and
insult over, your misconduct;--no! it is pure benievolence vwhlich prompts me to write: and I lhope I
shall not raise your resentmen-t. However, be the result what it may, I cannot bear to see you walk in
the patl,s that lead to destrulction, without warining
you of your dlanger; without sou n(ling in your ears
tile awful admonition.:, RetturTI and live; whly will
yout die?"-- have long observed antl pitied you; and

a most melarnclholy spectacle which I lately beheld,
made me resolve to caution you, lest you also come into the same condeimnation.
I was not long since called to visit a gentleman,
who, a short time b)efore, was of the most robust body,
and( gayest temper, I cver knew. Whent 1 visited him,
I fo(und him no mnore thlat slprightly aind vivaciouis so t1
of joy wvhichl he utsed to be: but languishing, pining
away, and \witherin, under tle clastisiut lhmil of God!
his litmbs feeble atl(l trembling; liis couitenance forlorn
and ghastly.; and the little breath whiichi he ad left,
sobbed out in sorrowful sigh-s! his bod(ly hastening
apace to the dust, to lodge inl tile silent grave, the land
of darkness alid desolation; his soul jut'st going to God
who gave it, and prep)aring itself to d(lepart to its long
home, to enter upon an unchangeable and eternal state.
Wlhenl I was come into his chamber, and hlad seated
myself by his bed, hlie cast a most wislhftil look Upol
me; and then began, as well as he was able, to speak.' Ohi! that I had been wise; that I hlad known thiis;
that I had considered miy latter end!- Deatl is knocking at mly door: in a few hours more I shall draw my
last-gasp; and thlen, judgment, tremnendous judgment!
Hlow shlall I appealr, unprepared as I am, before the
all-knowing and omnipotent God? how slhall 1 endure
the day of hlis coining?"
When I mentioned, among manay other things, that
strict holiness, whlich he lad formerly so slighltly esteemed, he replied with a lhasty eagerness: " O1!
th)at holness is tile only tilinig I now long for  I have
not words to tell you how highly I value it.  To obtaih it, I would gladly part with all my estate, large
as that is.-Now my beniglhted eyes are enlightened, I
clearly dliscern the things that are excellent. Whiat
is there in the place whither I anm going, but God?
or, whlat is tlhere to be desired on eartlh, but religion?"

hour for holiness, as I shlall soon labour for life. As
for riches, and pleasures, and the applause of men, I
account them as dross;-no more to miy happiniess than
the feathers thlat lie on thlle floor.-Ohl! if the righlte
ous Judge woul(l try me, once more;-if he would but
reprieve and spare me a little longer;-in what a
spirit would I spend the remainder of my days! I
would know no other business, aim at no other end,
than perfectinig myself in holiness: whatever contributed to that, every means of grace, every opportunity of spiritual improvement, should be dearer to me
than thousands of gold and silver.-But alas! why
-do I amuse myself with fond imaginations? The best
resolutions are now insignificanit, because they are
too late: the day, in wlhich I should have worked, is
over and gone; and I see a sad, horrible night ap])roaching, bringing with it the blackniess of darkness for ever. Hithlerto, (wo is me!) wlhen God called, I refused; when he invited, I was one of them
whio made excuses. Now, therefore, I receive the reward of mny deeds; fearfulness and( tremblinig are
come upon me; I am in sore anguilislh alceady; and
this is but tihe beginning of sorrows! It does not yet
appear xvhat I shiall be;-but, surely, I shiall be ruine(l, uldone!"
This sad scene I saw with my eyes; tihese wvords
and many nmore equially affecting, I heard with my
ears: and, soon after, I attended the unhappy genitleman to hlis tomb. The poor, breathless skeleton
spoke in such an accent, and withAo miuch earnestness, that I cotuld not easily forget him, or his words.
And as I was mrusing upon this sorrowfull subject, I
remembl)ered \Mr. Nasl;-I remeimbered yout, sir;---
fior I discerned too near an agreemelit and correspo;ndence betweentl yourself and the d(leceased. Tlicy are
alike, said I, in their ways; and what shall hinder
them from being alike in their end? TI'le coniise of
their actions is equally fiull of sin and folly; and whyADMONITORY L'EITT'ER S.
sliould not the period of thlem be equally fill of hor
ror and distress? I alm grievously aft'aid for the survivor, lest, as lie lives tlhe life, so lhe shouLll die tle
deathl, of this wretlched mlan.
For this cautse, therefore, I take my pen, to advise, to admonish, nay, to request you, to repent,
while you have o.pportunity; if hliaply you mnay find
grace and forgiveness. Yet a mnoment, and you maia
die; yet a little while, and you must dlie: and wvill
you go down with infamy and despair to the grave,
rather than depart in peace, and with hopes full of
immortality?
But I must tell you plainly, sir, with the utnmost
freedom, that your present behaviour is not the way
to reconcile youtrself to God: you are so far from
making atonement to offended justice, that you a re
aggravating the tformer accotunt, and heaping up an
increase of wrath against the day of wrath. For
what say the Scriptures? tlhose sacred bookhs, whiclh,
at the consummation of all things, the Ancient ot
days shlall open, and judge you by every jot andt tittle in them. They testify and declare to every soul
of man,, " That whosoever livethl in pleasutre, is dead
while he liveth:" so that as long as you roll on in at
continued circle or sensual delights, and vain entertainments, you alre, dead to all the l)purposes of piety
an(l virtue; you cannot work out yotur salvation, or
restore yourself to the Divine favour. Would you
be rescued from tlhe anger of Almnighty Godt? would
you be delivered fromn weeping, and wailing, and inl
cessant wo? Styrely you would!- -'Then I exhort you,
as a friend; I beseech you, as a brothelr; I charge
you, as a messenger fromn the great Godl, in his own
m-ost solemnn words: " Cast awvay fromi you your
transgressions; make yout a new heart, atnd a inew
slpirit: so iniquity slall not be yourl ruill."
Perhaps you miay be disposed to conte,n this letter, and its serious purport; or to rcommend it to!
