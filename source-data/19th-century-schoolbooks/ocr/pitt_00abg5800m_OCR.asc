tracted way of writing numbers, would be much more dif
ficult to be understood at first, than the numbers written at
length in words.  But they are not used merely as words,
they require operations peculiar to themselves. Tihey are,
In fact, a new language, which the pupil has to learn. The
pupil, therefore, when he commences arithmetic is presented with a set of abstract numbers, written with figures, and
so large that he has not the least conception of them even
when expressed in words. From these he is expected to
learn what the figures signify, and what is meant by addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division; and at the same
time how to perform these operations with figures. The
consequence is, that he learns only one of all those things, and
that is, how to perform these operations on figures. He can
perhaps translate the figures into words, but this is useless
since he does not understand the words themselves. Of tho
effect produced by the four fundamental operations he has not
the least conception.
Afler the abstract examples a few practical examples are
usually given, but these again are so large that the pupil
cannot reason upon them, and consequently he could not
tell whether he must add, subtract, multiply, or divide,
even if he had an adequate idea of what these operations
are.
The common method, therefore, entirely reverses the
natural process; for the pupil is expected to learn general
principles, before he has obtained the particular ideas of
which they are composed.
The usual mode of proceeding is as follows. The pupil
learns a rule, which, to the man that made it, was a general
principle; but with respect to hitim, and often times to the
imstructer himself, it is so far from it, that it hardly deserves to
be called even a mechanical principle. He performs the ex
amples, and makes the answers agree with those in the book,
and so presumes they are right. He is soon able to do this
with considerable facility, and is then supposed to be master
of the rule. He is next to apply his rule to practical examples.
but if he did not find the examples under the rule, lie would
never so much as mistrust they belonged to it. But finding
them there, he applies his rule to them, and obtains the answers, which are in the book, and this satisfies him that they
are right. In this manner he proceeds from rule to rule
through the book.
When an example is proposed to him, which is not in the
book, his sagacity is exercised, not in discovering the opera
tions necessary to solve it; but in comparing it with the exaIImploe which he has performed before, and endcavourina to 0ds

PARTS of one are called fractions. Fractions ma)
be expressed by figures, as well as whole numbers.
It requires two numbers to express a fraction; one
to show into how many parts one is divided, ana
tile other to show how many of those parts are
used. For example, if we wish to express one half,
(which means that one is divided into two equal
parts, and that one part is used,) we must use the
figure 2 to express that one is divided into two equal
parts, and the figure 1 to show that one part is
used. And these must be written in such a manner that we may always know what each of them
is intended to express.
One half is usually written thus, i; one number
above a line, and the other below it. The numbebelow the line shows into how many parts one is
divided, and the number above the line shows how
many parts are used.
One third is written   -    -    -
Two thirds -    -
One fourth  -    -.
Three fourths   --
Two fifths  -    -     -    -    -
Example. # of an apple signifies that the apple is
to be cut into 7 equal parts, and that 3 parts are
to be used.
Let us apply an example to Plate II. i refers to
a square divided into 8 parts, and signifies that 5
parts are to be used.
We may observe, that, when one is divided inte
3 parts, the parts are called thirds; when one is
divided into 4 parts, the parts are calledfourtlhs, &amp;c.
that is, the fraction takes its name from the number
of parts into which one is divided. The number
[Part 1,
106under the line is called the denominator, becatse
it gives name to the fraction; and the number
above the line is called the numerator, because it
shows the number of parts used..Thus T%, 10 is
the denominator and 3 the numerator.
N. B. The pupil must be made familiar with
this mode of expressing fractions, and must be able
to apply it to any familiar objects, as apples, oranges, &amp;c., and to the table, before he is allowed to
proceed any farther.  Particular care must be taken
to make him understand what the denominator signifies, and what the numerator, as explained above.
rhe denominator should always be explained first.
The following examples are a recapitulation of
some of the foregoing sections, for the purpose of
showing the application of the above method of
writing fractions.

107cover some analogy between it and them, either in the sound,
or in something else.  If he is fortunate enough to discover
any such analogy, he finds what rule to apply, and if he has
not been deceived in tracing the analogy, he will probably
solve the question. His knowledge of the principles of his
rule is so imperfect, that he would never discover to which
of them the example belongs, if he did not trace it by some
analogy, to the examples which he had found under it.
These observations do not apply equally to all; for some
will find the right course themselves, whatever obstacles be
thrown in their way. But they apply to the greater part;
and it is probable that there are very few who have not experienced more or less inconvenience from this mode of proceeding.  Almost all, who have ever fully understood arithmnetic,
have been obliged to learn it over again in their own way.
And it is not too bold an assertion to say, that no man ever
actually learned mathematics in any other method, than by
analytic induction; that is, by learning the principles by the
examples he performs; and not by learning principles first,
and then discovering by them how the examples are to be
performed.
In forming and arranging the several combinations, the
author has received considerable assistance from the system of
Pestalozzi. He has not, however, had an opportunity of seeing
Pestalozzi's own work on this subject, but only a brief outline
of it by another. The plates also are from Pestalozzi.  In
selecting and arranging the examples to illustrate these coinbinations, and in the manner of solving questions generally,
he has received no assistance from Pestalozzi.
THE BOY WITHOUT A GENIUS:
Mr. Wiseman, the schoolmaster, at the end of his summer vacation, received a new scholar with the following
letter:
Sir,-This will be delivered to you by my son Samuel, whom I beg
leave to commit to your care, hoping that, by your well-known skill
and attention, you will be able to make something of him, which, I am
sorry to say, none of his masters have hitherto done. He is now eleven, and yet can do nothing but read his mother tongue, and that but
indifferently. We sent him at seven to a grammar school in our
neighbourhood; but his master soon found that his genius was not
turned to learning languages. He was then put to writing, but ne
set about it so awkwardly that he made nothing of it. He was tried
at accounts, but it appeared that he had no genius for that either
lie could do nothing in geography for want of memory. In short, if

When the denominators in two or more frac.
tions are the same, the fractions are said to have a
common denominator. Thus 4 and i have a common denominator. We have seen that, when two
or more fractions have a common denominator, they
may be added and subtracted as well as whole
nrumbers. We add or subtract the numerators, and
write their sum or difference over the common
denominator. The first part of the process in the
above examples was to reduce them to a common
denominator.
76. Reduce i and i to a common denominator.
NOTE. They may be reduced to twelfths.
If it cannot be immediately seen what numbei
must be the common denominator, it may be found
by multiplying all the denominators together; for
that will always produce a number divisible by all
the denominators.

Your most obedient servant,
HUMPHREY ACRES.
WNrhen Mr. Wiseman had read this letter he shook his head, and said
to his assistant, a pretty subject they have sent us here! a lad that has
a great genius for nothing at all. But perhaps my friend Mr. Acres
expects that a boy should show a genius fbr a thing before he knows
any thing about it-no uncolnmon error! Let us see, however, what
the youth looks like. I suppose he is a human creature at least.
Master Samuel Acres was now called' in. He came hanging down
his head, and looking as it' he was going to be flogged.
Come hither, my dear! said Mr. Wisenlan-Stand by me, and do
not be afraid. Nobody will hurt you. How old are you?
Eleven last May, sir.
A well-grown boy of your age, indeed. You love play, I dare say.
Yes, sir.
What, are you a good hand at marbles?
Pretty good, sir.
And can spin a top and drive a hoop, I suppose?
Yes, sir.
Then you have the full use of your hands and fingers?
Yes, sir.
Can you write, Samuel?
I learned it a little, sir, but I left it off again.
And why so?
Because 1 could not make the letters.
No! Why, how do you think other boys do? Have thev more finigers
than you?
No sir.
Are you not able to hold a pen as well as a marble?
Samuel was silent.
Let me look at your hand.
Samuel held out both his paws, like a dancing bear.
I see nothing here to hinder you fronm writing as well as any boy in
the school. l ou can read, I suppose?
Yes, sir.
Tell me then what is written over the school-room door.
Samuel with some hesitation read, WHATEVER MAN HAS
DONE MAN MAY DO.
Pray how did you learn to read?-Was it not with taking pains?
Yes, sir.
WVell-taking more pains will enable you to read better. Do you
know any thing of the Latin Grammar?
No, sir.
hIave you never learned it?

ARITHMETIC.For convenience of reckoning, it is usual in calendars to call the year 365 days for 3 successive years,
and -very fourth year 366, (for in 4 years the six
hours' overplus amount to a day,) which is called
bissextile or leap year. This day is added to Febnlary.
The common year is divided into twelve months,
which are sometimes called calendar months, because they are the months used in calendars.
The names of the months, and the number of
*days in each, are as follows;

Right. Why here you have been practising the four great rules of
arithmnetic, additioi, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Learn-.ng accounts is no more than this. Well, Samuel, I see what you are
fit for. I shall set you about nothing but what you are able to do; but

Samuel went away, glad that his examination was over, and with.nore confidence in his powers than he had ftlt before.
l'he next day he began busiiness. A boy less than himself was called out to set him a copy of letters, and another was appointed to hear
him in grammar. He read a few sentences in English that he could
perfectly understand to the master himself. Thus by going on steadily
aiid slowly, he made a sensible progress. He had already joined his
letters, got all the declensions pertfctly, and half the multiplication table when Mr. Wiseman thought it time to answer his father's letter,
which he did as follows:
Sir,

your son. You perhaps expectetl it sooner. but I always wish to avoid
hasty judgments. You meintioned in your letter that it had not yet
been discovered which way his genius pointed. If by genius you
meant such a decided bent of mind to any one pursuit as will lead to
excel with little or no labour or instruction, I must say that I have not

your son is certainly not among the number. But if you mean'olll

or to some practical profession, I see no reason to doubt that he naty
in time become sufficiently qualified for it. It is my favourite maxim,
sir, that every thing most valuable in this life may generally he acquired by taking pains for it. Your son has already lost much time in the
fruitless expectation of finding out what he would take up of his own
accord. Believe me, sir, few boys will take up any thing of their own
accord but a top or a marble. I will take care while he is with me
that he loses no more time this way, but is employed about things
that are fit for him, nlot doubting that we shall find him fit for them.

PART II.
KEY.
TiEn Key contains an explanation of the plates,
and the manner of using them. The manner of
solvin, the examples in each section is particularly
explained. All the most difficult of the practical examples are solved in such a manner, as to show the
prineiples by which they are performed. Care has
been taken to select examples for solution, that will
explain those which are not solved. Many remarks
with regard to the manner of illustrating the principles to the pupils, are inserted in their proper
places.
Instructers who may never have attended to fractionts, need not be afraid to undertake to teach this
book. The author flatters himself that the principles are so illustrated, and the processes are made so
simple, that any one, who shall undertake to teach
it, will find himself familiar with fractions before he
is aware of it, although he knew nothing of them
jefore; and that every one will acquire a facility in
solving questions, which he never before possessed.
The reasoning used in performing these small examples is precisely the same, as that used upon
large ones. And when any one finds a difficulty in
solving a question, he will remove it much sooner,and much more effectually, by taking a very smalli
example of the same kind, and observing how he
does it, than by recurring to a rule.
The practical examples at the commencement of
each section and article, are generally such as to
show the pupil what the combination is, and how he
is to perform it. This will learn the pupil gradually to reason upon abstract numbers. In each conlbination, there are a few abstract examples without
practical ones, to exercise the learner in the combinations, after he knows what these combinations
are. It would be an excellent exercise for the pupil to put these into a practical form when he is reciting.  For instance when the question is, how
many are 5 and 3. Let hlim make a question in this
way; if anl orange cost 5 cents, and an apple 3 cents,
what would they both come to'? Thllis may be done
in all cases.
The examples are often so arranged, that several
depend on each other, so that ths preceding explains the following one. Sometimes also in the
sanme example, there are several questions asked,
so as to lead tile pupil gradually from the simple to
the more difficult. It would be well for the pupil
to acquire the habit of doing this for himself, when
difficult questions occur.
The plates should be used for young pupils, but
they are not necessary' for the older ones. The
plates for fractions however will frequently be usefiil to these. The first plate need not be used mucll,
after the pupil is familiar with the multiplication
table.
The book may be used in classes where it is convenient. The pupil may answer the questions with
the book before him or not, as the instructer tliinks
proper. A very usefill mode of recitation is, for
tbe instrulcter to read the  xaminple to the whole

perform the question, call upon some one to answer
it. In this manner every pupil will be oblig,ed to
perform the example, because they do not know
who is to answer it. In this way it will be best for
them to answer without the book.
It will often be well to let the elder pupils hear
the younger.   This will be a useful exercise for
them, and an assistance to the instructer.
Explanation of Plate I.
This plate, viewed horizontally, presents ten rows
of rectangles, and in each row ten rectangles.
In the first row, each rectangle contains one mark,
each mark representing unity or one. In the second row each rectangTle contains two marlks, in the
third, three marks, &amp;c.
The purpose of this plate is, first, to represent
unity either as a unit, or as making a part of a sum
of units.  Secondly, to represent a collection of
units, either as forming a unit itself, or as making a
part of'another collection of units; and thus to compare unity and each collection of units with another
collection, in order I'- ascertain their ratios.
All the examples, as far as the eighth section, canI
be solved by this plate. The manner of usiing it is
explained in the key for each section in its proper
place.
The pupil, if very young, should first be taught
to count the units, and to name the different asseniblages of units in tile following manner:
The instructer showing him the first row, whichl
contains ten units insulated, requests tile pupil t(o
put his finger on the first, and say one; then on the
second and say, and one are two, and on the third and
say, and one are thiree, and so on to ten; then colrn

KEY.
143mencillg the row again, let him continue and say,
ten and onte are eleven, &amp;c.
After adding them, let him begin with ten, and
say, ten less one are nine, nine less one are eight, &amp;c.
Thlen, taking larger numbers, as twenty or thirty,
let him subtract them in the same manner.
Next, let him name the different assemblages, as
twos, threes, &amp;c. Afterwards, let him count the
number of units in each row.
Note. The sections, articles, and examples, are
referred to by the same marks which distinguish
them in Part I.
SECTION     I.
A. TIIis section contains addition and subtraction.
The first examples may be solved by means of beans,
peas, &amp;c. or by plate I.    Tile former mefhod is
preferable, if the pupil be very young, not only for
the examples in the first part of this section, but for
the first examples in all the se-'"ons.
The pupil will probably solve the first examples
without any instruction.
Examples in addition and subtraction may be
solved by plate I. as follows:
How many are 5 and 3?* Select a rectangle containing 5 marks, and another containing 3 marks,
and ascertain the number of marks in both.
How many are 8 and 6? Select a rectangle contain

144ing 8 marks, and another containing 6 marks, and
count them together.
How many are 17 and 5? Keeping 17 in the
mind, select a rectangle containing 5 marks, and
add thom thus: 17 and 1 are 18, and 1 are 19, and
I are 20, and 1 are 21, and 1 are 22.
If you take 4 from 9, how many will remain?
Select a rectangle containing 9 marks, and take
away four of them.
18 less 5 are how many? Keeping 18 in mind,
select a rectangle containing 5, and take them away
I at a time.
In this manner all the examples in this section may
be solved.
B &amp; C. The articles B and C contain the common
addition table as far as the first 10 numbers. In
the first the numbers are placed in order, and in
the second out of order.
The pupil should study these until he can find
the answers readily, and then he should commit the
answers to memory.
D. In this article the numbers are larger than in
the preceding, and, in some instances, three or more
numbers are added together. In the abstract examples the numbers from one to ten are to be added to the numbers from ten to twenty.
E. This article contains subtraction.
F. This article is intended to make the pupil
familiar with adding the nine first numbers to all
others. The pupil should study it until he can anawer the questions very readily.
G. In this article all the preceding are combined

6. 37 less 5 are 32, less 8 are 24, less 6 (which
he kept himself) are 18; consequently he gave 19

THis section contains multiplication. The pupil
will see no difference between this and addition,
It is best that he should not at first, though it may
be well to explain it to him after a while.
A. This article contains practical questions, which
the pupil will readily answer.
1. Three yards will cost 3 times as much as 1

N. B. Be careful to make the pupil give a similar reason for multiplication, both in this article,
and elsewhere.
This question is solved on the plate thus; in the
second row, count 3 rectangles, and find their sum.
2 and 2 are 4, and 2 are 6.
11. A man will travel 4 times as far in 4 hours as
he will in 1 hour. In the third row count 4 tines

order.
D. In this article multiplication is applied to
practical examples. They are of the same kind as
those in article A of this section.

times, as- in the above example, after taking it 10
times on the plate, begin at the beginning of the
row again, and take enough to make up the number.

A. Tinis section contains division.  The pupil
will scarcely distinguish it from multiplication. It
is not important that he should at first.
Though the pupil will be able to answer these
questions by the multiplication table, if he has committed it to memory thoroughly; yet it will be better to use the plate for some time.

15 dollars, so many yards of cloth may be bought

fifteen, and see how many times 3 it makes. It ir
performed very nearly like multiplication.
B. In this article the pupil obtains the first ideas
of fractions, and learns the most important of the
terms which are applied to fractions.* The pupil
has already been accustomed to look upon a collection of units, as forming a number, or as being itself
a part of another number. He knows, therefore,
that one is a part of every number, and that every
number is a part of every number larger than itself.
As every number may have a variety of parts, it is
necessary to give names to the different parts, in ordei
to distinguish them from each other. The parts
* As soon as the terms applied to fractions are fully comprehended.
the operations on them are as simple as those on whole numbera
KEY.
LPart 2
148receive their names, according to the number of
parts which any number is divided into. If the
number is divided into two equal parts, the parts are
called halves; if it is divided into three equal parts,
they are called thirds; if into four parts, fourths,
&amp;c.; and, having divided a number into parts, we
can take as many of the parts as we choose. If a
number be divided into five equal parts, and three
of the parts be taken, the fraction is called three
fifths of the number. The name shows at once into
how many parts the number is to be divided, and
how many parts are taken.'Ihe examples in this book are so arranged that
the names will usually show the pupil how the operation is to be performed. In this section, although
the pupil is taught to divide numbers into various
parts, he is not taught to notice any fractions, except those where the numbers are divided into their
simple units, which is the most simple kind.
It will be best to use beans, pebbles, &amp;c. first;
and then plate I.
4. Show the pupil one of the rectangles in the
second row, and explain to him that one is 1 halt
of 2.
7. In the second row count 3 units; it will take
all the marks in the first, and 1 in the second rectangle. Consequently it is 1 time 2, and 1 half of
another 2.
15. In the second row count 9. It will take all
the marks in the four first rectangles, and 1 in the
fifth. Therefore 9 is 4 times 2 and one half of
another 2.
18. Show the pupil a rectangle in the third row.
and ask him the question, and explain to him that 1
is 1 third of 3.

149rectangles and 2 marks in the fourth. Therefore
11 is 3 times 3, and 2 thirds of another 3.
Proceed in the same manner with the other divisions.
This being one of the most useful combinations,
and one but very little understood by most people,
especially when applied to large numbers, the pupil must be made perfectly familiar with it. Ask
questions like those in the book for large numbers,
and also some like the following: WVhat part of 7
is 18? the answer will be -a.
C. The first ten figures are here expiained.
They are used as an abridged method of writing
numbers, and not with any reference to their use in
calculating.
This article is only a continuation of the last.
All the numbers from 1 to 100 are introduced into
the two articles, and are divided by all the numbers
from 1 to 10; except that some of the largest are
not divided by some of the smallest.

count 63. It will take 12 rectangles and 3 marks
in the 13th. It will be necessary to count once
across the plate, and begin again, and take 2 rectangles and a part of the third. 63 is 12 times 5
and 3 fifths of another 5.

Explanation of Plate II.
PLATE I, which has been used in the preceding
sections, presents each unit as a simple object and
undivided. Plate II presents the units as divisible
objects, the different fractions of which form parts,
and sums of parts of unity.
This plate is divided into ten rows of equal
squares, and each row into ten squares.
The first row is composed of ten empty squares,
which are to be represented to the pupil as entire
units. The second row presents ten squares, each
divided into two equal parts by a vertical line; each
of these parts of course represents one half. In
the third row, each square is divided into three
equal parts, by two vertical lines, each part representing one third, &amp;c. to the tenth row, which is divided into ten equal parts, each part representing
one tenth of unity.
N. B. In plates II and III, the spaces and not
the marks are to be counted.

Explanation of Plate JIl.
Plate III is intended to represent fractions of
unity, divided into other fractions; it is, therefore,
an extension of plate II. It differs from it only
in this, that, besides the vertical divisions, the
squares are divided horizontally, so as to cut the
fractions of the square into fractions of fractions.
The horizontal lines are dotted, but they are to be
considered as lines.
This plate, like the preceding, is divided into
ten rows of squares, each row containing ten equal
squares. In the first row, the first square is undivided, the 9 following squares are divided by horizontal lines into from two to ten equal parts. In all
the other squares the vertical divisions are the same
as in plate II, and, besides this, each row is divided
horizontally in the same manner as the first row.
By means of this double division, the second row
presents a series of fractions, from halves to twentieths. The 3d row presents a series from thirds to
thirtieths, and so on to the tenth row, which presents a series from tenths to hundredths.
The 2d row, besides presenting halves, fourths,
sixths, eighths, &amp;c. shows also halves of halves,
thirds of halves, fourths,of halves, &amp;c. and shows
their ratios with unity.
The 3d row, besides thirds, sixths, ninths, &amp;c.
shows halves of thirds, thirds of thirds, &amp;c. and
their ratios with urity. The other rows present
analogous divisions.

163SECTION XIII.
THE operations in this section are the educing
of fractions to a common denominator, and the addition.and subtraction of fractions. The examples
will generally show what is to be done, and how it
is to be done. Plate III will be found very useful
in explaining the operations, by exhibiting the divisions to the eye.
1. The first example may be illustrated by the
second square in the second row. This square is
divided into halves by a vertical line, and then into
fourths by the horizontal line. It will be readily
seen that ~ makes 2 fourths, and that the first had
twice as nmuch as the second. The plate will not
be so necessary for the practical questions as for
the'abstract. In the second example, therefore, it
will be more useful than in the first.
4. It will readily be seen on the second square of
the second row, that J and J-are J.
8. It will be seen in the third square of the second row, that J makes }.
10 and 12. In the second square of the third row,
it will be found, that i makes i; and that i make f.
25. In the fourth square of the second row, it
will be seen that 1 half is t; and in the second
square of the fourth row, J is i, both together make
X and J make j.
27. In the second square of the fourth row, J is
the same as 1.
33. In the fifth square of the fourth row, it will
be seen that J (made by the vertical division) contains A; and in the fourth square of the fifth row
i contains jl~r, and * contain A; and in the second
square of the tenth row,3G contains j.
When these questions are performed in the mind,
the pupil will explain them as follows. He will

164probably do it without assistance. Twenty twentieths make one whole one. X of 20 is 5, and i of
20 is 8, and h6 of 20 is 2; therefore - is,~, i is
9ly and Xra is 96. All the examples should be explained in the same manner.
45. In the 8th row, the 7th square is divided vertically into 8 parts, and horizontally into 7 parts;
the square, therefore, is divided into 56 parts; 3 of
the vertical divisions, or i, contain j-.
51. 1 half is I, and i is i, which added together
make 1.
61. i is ~s-, ~ is ePu, i is h, which added together make J4.
67. * is', j is -, which added together make
jj; from * take *., and there remains J1, or 1.
82. It will be easily perceived that these examples do not differ from those in the first part of the
section, except in the language used. They must
be reduced to a common denominator, and then
they may be added and subtracted as easily as
whole numbers. * is', and i is A, and both together make *, or lTi.
86. J is i, and  is {. If * be taken from I there
remains i.
B. This article contains only a practical application of the preceding.
3. This example and some of the following contain mixed numbers, but they are quite as easy as
the others. The whole numbers may be added
separately, and the fractions reduced to a common
denominator, and then added as in other cases, aund
afterwards joined to the whole numbers. 6 and 2
are 8; 1 half and * are [, making in the whole 8)
bushels.
5. 6 and 2 are 8; J and ~ and i are i[ or 1,
which joined with 8 make 93J.

165C. It is difficult to find examples which will aptly
illustrate this operation. It can be done more conveniently by the instructer. Whenever a fraction
occurs, which may be reduced to lower terms, if it
be suggested to the pupil, he will readily perceive
it and do it. This may be done in almost any part
of the book, but more especially after studying the
13th section. Perhaps it would be as well to omit
this-article the first time the pupil goes through the
book, and, after he has seen the use of the operation,
to let him study it. It may be illustrated on Plate
[II in the following manner.
8. *l. Find all the squares which are divided
into 24 parts. There are 4 squares which are divided into 24 parts, viz. the 8th in the 3d row, the
3d in the 8th row, the 6th in the 4th row, and the
4th in the 6th row. Then see if exactly 18 can be
found in one or more of the vertical divisions. In
the 6th square of the 4th row, there are exactly 18
divisions in three vertical divisions, but those 3 vertical divisions are J of the whole square, because it
is divided into fourths vertically; therefore j- are
equal to J.
13. f. Find the squares which are divided into
56 parts; they are the 8th in the seventh row, and
the 7th in the 8th row; see if in either of them,
one or more of the vertical divisions contain exactly
42 parts. In the 7th of the 8th row, 6 vertical di
visions contain exactly 42; these divisions are I of
the square, for it is divided vertically into 8 parts.
But I may be still reduced to i, as may be seen by
looking on the 3d square of the 4th row; therefore
J is equal to f.

A. THIs section contains the division of fractions by
whole numbers, and the multiplication of one fractior.
by another. Though these operations sometimes
appear to be division, and sometimes multiplication,
yet there is actually no difference in the operations.
Thle practical examples will generally show how
the operations are to be performed, but it will be
well to use.the plate for young pupils.
I and 2. In the second row, the 2d square is divided vertically into halves, and each of the halves
is divided into halves by the horizontal line; a of -1
is therefore 4 of the whole.
3 and 4. In the third row, the 2d square shows
that I of 4 is $.
16 and 17. In the 5th row, the 3d square shows
that 4 of' is Is' of the whole.
33. Since 3 of a share signify 3 parts of a share,
At is evident that 4 of the three parts is 1 part, that
is I.
39. 4 signify 9 pieces or parts, and it is evident
thiat 4 of 9 parts is 3 parts, that is 4.
43. We cannot take - of 5 pieces, therefore we
must take I of 1, which is 1, and i is 5 times as
much as 4, therefore I of 4 is ~~. This may he
readily seen on the plate. In the sixth row, third
square, find 4 by the vertical division, then these
being divided each into three parts by the horizontal division, and 4 of each being taken, you will
have -.

"This manual is much needed. There is no work, in this country. which in
adapted near as well, in my judgrluent, to assist those who are called upon to pre-  
side in public assemblies, to discllarge their duties acceptably and profitably to
the community."
" This is a book exceedingly neerded, by one remarkably well qualified to write
It. In a land where the people rule and which is of course full of deliberative bodies, it is strange that we should not have had a hand-book of order, as familiar to
us all as our arithmetics. To all who are called to preside, (and who may not
be some where?) it must be invaluable. The book is got up in a neat and ooavenient form.-Boston Chronicle.
"It is a most excellent manual. We have seen no work which instructs those
who have to preside over public bodies so plaillly and distinctly. It is thought
very difficult to manage large bodies. That difilculty this book will remove."

1HA   JUST PUBLISHED
NORTHEND'S BOOK-KEEPI?NG,
Being a Treatise in two parts a Day Book and Ledger, upon Single Entry,
intended for Retail Business. Blank paper is attached to each book, and it
Is admitted by the numerous teachers who now use it, to be the most simple, and at the same time thle most complete work upon that subject now
snown.
OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
The Salem Gazette says: --" This is the best and clearest illustration of
the system of Single Entry that we remember to have seen, and we think it
will become a standard work on the subject."
The Salem Observer says: --" Mr. Northend is well known as one of (,ur
most successful teachers; and, in preparing a system of Book Keeping, by
Single Entry, for Common Schlools, he has been eminently successful in m,aking a plain, practical, and economical work. For the purpose for which it
Is designed, we think it preferable to any work we have seen.'
The New2buryport Herald says:-" Most of the treatises of this kind which
have been published, have been unnecessarily complex, and required much
more time of the learner to understand ther., than seemed desirable. This
work is very simple and practical, and illustrated in a familiar maniner."
The Neewburyport Courier says:--" AWe are right glad to see this work,
the first of the kind witlh which we are acquainted, at all adapted to our
Common Schools. We hope our School Commlnittees will immedliately take
some steps t-v introduce the work irnto the schools, that the boys, who are
now wasting tleir time on what they do not undlerstand, may have something which wilh'Ne practically useful in life. We wish the atithor of the
work befbre us, s-.'cess; his book seems to possess that simplicity of arrangement which wi.'ake its details easily understood by quite young pupils. We recommend the work to all insterested in the advancement of
Common School Education."
The Danvers Courier says: --" It is very simple, and affords just so much
information to the scholar as will acqulaint hiln with the usual forms of business, and is so illustrated by examples as to be easily understood by the
learner.'
The Essex County Whig says:--" We are glad that a system of bookkeeping like this has been published. It meets the wants of a generality of
business men; and the experience of the great mass of mechanics, farmers,
and retail merchaists, for whom this book is designed, is teachinig them every
day the need of such instruction as is here given. "
The Christian Register says: - " Mr. Northend is well known to us as a
most enlightened and successful teacher  From an acquaintance with him,
as an instructor, and from an examhi%tion of the general appearance, arrangement, anld character of his system, we confidently reconunmend it to
teachers and pupils."
The Quiscy Aurora says. --" It is a simple and practical system by stin
gle entry; and, for those who have occasion to use no other method, It is the
best work we have ever seen. "
The Albany (Nr. Y.) Argats says: --" We are glad to see awork so well designed to supply a defect long experienced in the want of a proper textbook for Corlnmon Schools. This system is simple, well arranlged, and well
executed. Any pupil, filling up these books according to the directions,
could scarcely fail of obtaining a competent knowledge of single entry."

rOt act from Mr. Page's Lectutre before the American Institute,
August 1843.
Mr. Page is now Principal of the Normal School at Albany.
I shall venture to mention THHE book which I consider the
pioneer in this country, in the great reform in school books. It is
a book of small size, of no very loud pretensions, but it is THE
BOOK which has done more in this country, not only for the particular branch on which it treats, but for most other branches, by its
indirect influence upon the character of teachers and authors, and
the method of imparting instruction in general, than any other
that hlas been written in our language. It is that little volume
called' FIliST LESSONS IN ARITHMETIC, BY WARREN COLBURN.'
In this book of 172 pages, Mr. C. has opened the principles of
Arithmetic in a strictly analytic way. as he says, after the mauner
of Pestalozzi.
The reason, the understanding, is addressed, and led on step by
step, till the whole is taken into the mind and becomes a part of it.
The memory is little thought of, yet the memory cannot let it slip;
for what has been drunk in, as it were, by the understanding, and
made a part of the mind, the mind never forgets! To how many
a way worn and weary pupil under the old system; to how many
a profieient, who could number his half dozen authors, and twice
that rnumber of manuscript cyphering books; to how many a
teacher even, who had taught the old system, winter after winter,
and vet saw but as'through a glass darkly;' to how many such,
was this book on its appearance' Their First Lessons inl Arithmetic?' WARREN COLBURN'S name should be written in a conspicuous place, in letters of gold, for this service.
Extract from the Report of the Committee on ArithrieftW, of thle
Essex County Teachers' Association. -,Nov. 30, 1838.
Colburn's' FIRST LEssONS,' it is admitted by all who have
made themselves thoroughly acquainted with them, are beyond all
estimation. It is the opinion of the Committee, that the Analysis
of the principles of Arithmetic is as perfectly presented in this
little book as it can be done. There is just enough of it; neither
too much nor too little. They are furtheropf the opinion, that it
should be a text book in every school, not to take the place of
written arithmetic, but to take its own place. I*  *  It is no
perishable fame to have been the author of COLBURN'S FIRST
LxsSONS.'
The Annual Report of the School Committee of Cambridge, as
submitted, March, 1844, in speaking of the Text Books used in the
schools, says,' Colburn's First Lessons -perhaps, all things con
sidered, the best Elementary School Book in the language -is
ased in the Middie Schools.'ARITHMETIC.

RECOMMENDATIONS.
Sir,
I have made use of the Arithmetic and Tables, which you sometime
snce prepared, on the system of Pestalozzi; and have been much gratified with the improved edition of it, which you have showsn me. I am
satisfied, from experiment, that it is the most effectual and interesting
mode of teaching the science of numbers with which I am acquainted.
Respectfully,
Your obedient servant
IHENRY &amp;OLMAN.
Mr. Warren Colburn.
Having been made acquainted with Mr. Colbunt's treatise on Aritnmnetic, and having attended an examination of his scholars, who had been
taught according to this system, I am well satisfied that it is tle most
easy, simple, and natural way of introducing young persons to the first
principles in the science of numbers. The method here proposed is the
fruit of much study and reflection. The author has had considerab.e experience as a teacher, added to a strong interest in the subject, and a
thorough knowledge not only of this but of many of the higher branches
of mathematics. This little work is therefore earnestly recommenlded to
the notice of those who are employed in this branch of early Instructlon
with the belief that it only reqwres a fair trial in order to be fiully approv.

47PREFACE.
As soon as a child begins to use his senses, nature contin
ually presents to his eyes a variety of objects; and one of the
first properties which he discovers, is the relation of number.
He intuitively fixes upon unity as a measure, and from this
he forms the idea of more and less; which is the idea of
quantity.
The names of a few of the first numbers are usually learned
very early; and children frequently learn to count as far as a
hwndred before they learn their letters.
As soon as children have the idea of more and less, and the
names of a few of the first numbers, they are able to make small
calculations  And this we see therfl do every day about their
playthings, and about the little affairs which they are called
upon to attend to. The idea of more and less implies addition;
hence they will often perform these operations without any
previous instruction. If, for example, one child has three apples, and another five, they will readily tell how many they
both have; and how many one has more than the other. If a
child be requested to bring three apples for each person in
the room, he will calculate very readily how many to bring,
if the number does not exceed those he has learnt. Again
if a child be requested to divide a number of apples among
a certain number of persons, he will contrive a way to do it,
and will tell how many each must have. The method which
children take to do these things, though always correct, is not
always the most expeditious.
The fonaness which children usually manifest for these
exercises, and the facility with which they perform them,
seem to indicate that the science of nunibers, to a certain
extent, should be among the first lessons taught to them.*
To succeed in this, however, it is necessary rather to furnish occasions for them to exercise their own skill in performing examples, than to give them rules. They should be
allowed to pursue their own method first, and then they

57the best, some improvement should be suggested. By fol.
lowing this mode, and making the examples gradually increase in difficulty; experience proves, that, at an early age,
children may be taught a great variety of the most useful
combinations of numbers.
Few exercises strengthen and mature the mind so much as
arithmetical calculations, if the examples are made sufficiently simple to be understood by the pupil; because a regular,
though simple process of reasoning is requisite to perform
them, and the results are attended with certainty.
The idea of number is first acquired by observing sensible.objects. Having observed that this quality is common to all
things with which we are acquainted, we obtain an abstract
idea of number. We first make calculations about sensible
objects; and we soon observe, that the same calculations
will apply to things very dissimilar; and finally, that they
may be made without reference to any particular things.
Hence from particulars, we establish general principles,
which serve as the basis of our reasonings, and enable us to
proceed step by step, fronm the most simple to the more comrn.
plex operations.  It appears, therefore, that mathematical
reasoning proceeds as rnmuch upon the principle of analytic
induction, as that of any other science.
Examples of any kind upon abstract numbers, are of very
little use, until the learner has discovered the principle from
practical examples. They are more difficult in themselves,
for the learner does not see their use; and therefore does
not so readily understand the question. But questions of a
practical kind, if judiciously chosen, show at once what the
combination is, and what is to be effected by it. Hence the
pupil will much more readily discover the means by which
the result is to be obtained. The mind is also greatly assisted in the operations by reference to sensible objects. When
the pupil learns a new combination by means of abstract examples, it very seldom happens that he understands practical
examples more easily for it, because he does not discover the
connexion, until lie has performed several practical examples and begins to generalize them.
After the pupil comprehends an operation, abstract examples are useful, to exercise hlim, and make him familiar with
it. And they serve better to fix the principle, because they
teach the learner to generalize.
From the above observations, and from his own experi
ence, the author has been induced to publish this treatise; in
which he has pursued the following plan, which seemed to
him the most agreeable to the natural progress of the minds

GENERAL VIEW OF THE PLAN.
Every combination commences with practical examples.
Care has been taken to select such as will aptly illustrate the
combination, and assist the imagination of the pupil in performing it. In most instances, immediately after the practical, abstract examples are placed, containing the same
numbers and the same operations, that the pupil may the
more easily observe the connexion. The instructer should
be careful to make the pupil observe the connexion. After
these are a few abstract examples, and then practical questions again.
The numbers are small, and the questions so simple, that
almost any child of five or six years old is capable of understanding more than half the book, and those of seven or
eight vears old can understand the whole of it.
The examples are to be performed in the mind, or -by
means of sensible objects, such as beans, nuts, &amp;c. or by
means of the plate at the end of the book. The pupil should
first perform the examples in his own way, and then be made
to observe and tell how lie did them, and why le did them
so.*
* It is remarkable, that a child, although he is able to perform a variety of examples which iiivolve additioiI, subtraction, multiplication,
anld division, recognises no operationbut additioni. Indeed, if we alalyze these operatiols whein we perform ttienl in our miii(ls, we shall
find that they all reduce themsel--es to addition. They are only different ways of applying the same principle. And it is only when we use
anl artificial method of performing them, that they take a differellt
form.
If the following questions were proposed to a child, lis answers would
be, in substanice, like those annexed to the qluestionis. Htow much is
five less than eight'? Ans. Three. Why? because five aiid three are
eight. What is the dilTireInce betweenl five and eilght? Ans. Three.
Why? because five and three are cighht. If you divide eight inito two
parts, such that onle of the parts may be five, what Xwill the other be?
Aiis. T'lhree. WIy? lecause five and three are eight.
How much mtlst you give for fiur apples at two cenlts apiece? Ans.
Eight cents. WXVIhy? because two and two are four, and two are six,
all two are eight.
How many apples, at two cents apiece, can you buy for eight cents?
Anis. Four. Why? because two and two are four, and two are six.
and two are eight.
\NTe shall be further convinced of this if we observe that the same
t;ble serves for addition aiid subtraction; and another table wliech is

77The use of the plates is explained in the Key at the end
of the book.  Several examples in each section are pcrformed
in the Key, to show the method of solving them. No answers
are given in the book, except where it is necessary to explain
something to the pupil.  Most of the explanations are given
in the Key; because pupils generally will not understand any
explanation given in a book, especially at so early an age.
The instructer must, therefore, give the explanation viva voce
These, however, will occupy the instructer but a.very short
time.
The first section contains addition and subtraction, the second multiplication. The third section contains division. In
this section the pupil learns the first principles of fractions and
the terms which are applied to them. This is done by making
him observe that one is the half of two, the third of three, the
fourth of four, &amp;c. and that two is two thirds of three, two
fourths of f,ur, two fifths of five, &amp;c.
The fourth section commences with multiplication. In this
the pupil is taught to repeat a number a certain number of
times, and a part of another time. In the second part of this
section the pupil is taught to change a certain number of twos
into threes, threes into fours, &amp;c.
In the fifth section the pupil is taught to find ~,.,., &amp;c.
and i, ~, i, &amp;c. of numbers, which are exactly divisible into
these parts. This is only an extension of the principle of fractions, which-is ocntained in the third section.
In the sixth section the pupil learns to tell of what number
any number, as 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. is one half, one third, one fourth,
&amp;c.; and also, knowing 5, i, 2, &amp;e. of a number, to find that
number.
These combinations contain all the most common and most
useful operations of vulgar fractions.  But being applied only
to numbers which are exactly divisible into these fractional
parts, the pupil will observe no principles but multiplication
and division, unless he is told of it.  In fact, fractions contain
no other principle. The examples are so arranged, that aliost any child of six or seven years old will readily conlprehend them. And the questions are asked in such a manner,
that, if the instructer pursues the method explained in the
Key, it will be almost impossible for the pupil to perform any
example without understanding the reason of it. Indeed, in
formed by addition serves both for multiplication and division. In this
treatise the same piate serves for the four operations.
This remark shows the necessity of making the pupil attend to his
manner of performing the examples, and of explaining to him the dif
ference between them.

Let the instructer ask the pupil the divisions of aunit
in this manner as fart as the dlivision into 10 parts.
It would be well to ask them further.  Then let him
begin again, and suppose an orange instead of an apple. After applying the division to several different
things, Plate II. may be explained and used. It will
often be found useful to refer the pupil to the divisions
of some sensible object. For the explanation of Plate
17. see the Key.

give 1 half of a bushel apiece to some labourers;
how many could he give it to?

a complete demonstration of the principle by which he
does it; and at the same time he does it in the simplest way
oossible. These observations apply to the remaining part ot
the book.
These principles are sufficient to enable the pupil to per
form almost all kinds of examples that ever occur.  He will
not, however, be able to solve questions in Which it is necessary to take fractional parts of unity, though the principles
are the same.
After section sixth, there is a collection of miscellaneous
examples, in which are contained almost all the kinds that
usually occur, There are none, however, which the principles explained are not sufficient to solve.
In section eight and the following, fractions of unity are
explained, and, it is believ'd, so simply as to be intelligible to
most pupils of seven or eight years of age. The operations
do not differ materially from those in the preceding sections.
There are some operations, however, peculiar to fractions.
The two last plates are used to illustrate fractions.
When the pupil is made familiar with all the principles contained in this book, he will be able to perform all examples in
which the numbers are so small, that the operations may be
performed in the mind.  Afterwards he has only to learn the
application of figures to these operations, and his knowledge of
arithmetic will be complete.
The Rule of Three, and all the other rules which are usually
contained in our arithmetics, will be found useless. The
examples under these rules will be performed upon general
principles with much greater facility, and with a greater degree of certainty.
The following are some of the principal difficulties which
a child has to encounter in learning arithmetic in the usual
way, and which are seldom  overcome.   First, the examples are so large, that the pupil can form no conception of
the numbers themselves; therefore it is impossible for him
to comprehend the reasoning upon them. Secondly, the
first examples are usually abstract numbers. This increases
the difficulty very much, for even if the numbers were so
small, that the pupil could comprehend them, he would discover but very little connexion between them and practical
examples. Abstract numbers, and the operations upon them,
must be learned from practical examples; there is no such
thing as deriving practical examples from those which are
abstract, unless the abstract have been first derived from
those which are practical. Thirdly, the numbers are expressed by figures, which, if they were used only as a conPREFACE,
