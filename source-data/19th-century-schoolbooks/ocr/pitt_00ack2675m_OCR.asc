There is but one God, the author, the cre.
ator, and governor of the World; almighty,
eternal, and invisible.
To the one who is supreme, most wise, and
beneficent, and to him alone, belong worship,
adoration, and praise. He hath streched forth
the heavens with his hands, he hath described
with his finger the courses of the stars.  He
setteth bounIds to the ocean that it canlnot
pass; and saith unto the stormy winds, Be still.'The provideitce of God is over all his
works; he rule~ and directs with infinite wisdom.
Wonderful he is in all his ways; the manner of his knowledge is above thy conception.
Pay therefore to his wisdom all knowledge
and veneration; and bow down thyself in
humble and submissive obedience to his supreme direction.,The high alld the low, the rich and the
poor, the wise and the ignorant, when the soul
has shaken off the cumbrous shackles of this
mortal life, shall equally receive, from the sentence of God, a just and everlasting retribution according to their works.
0 fear the Lord therefore all the days of
thy life, and walk in the paths which he hath
opened before thee. Let prudence adrrmonish
thee; let justice guide thy hand, benevolence
warm thy heart, and gratitude to heaven inspire thee with devotion. These shall give
thee happiness in thy present state, and bring
thee to zhe mansions of eternal felicity in the
paradise of God.SECTl^ION I.

It is not in flesh to think; it is not in bone,to reason. The lion knoweth not that worms
shall eat him; the ox perceives not that he is
fed for slaughter.
God formed thee as he had formed these;
after them all wert thou created. Superiority
and command were given thee over all, and
with his own breath did he communicate to
thee the principle of knowledge.
Know thyself then, the pride of J is creation, the link uniting divinity and matter; behold a part of God himself within thee; remember thy oven dignity, nor dare descend to
evil or to meanness.

Cast not an evil eye on the goods of your
neighbours; let whatever is their property be
sacred from your touch.
In your dealings with men, be impartial and
just; and do unto them as you would they
should do unto you.
Be faithful to your trusts, and deceive not the
man who relies upon you; for it is less evil in
the sight of God to steal than to betray.
Oppress not the poor, and defraud not the
tabouring man of his wages.
Pay the debts you owe, for he who gave you
credit relied upon your honour, and to withhold from him his due is both mean anld unjustY

Importance of Cleanfine's.
D)o not be uncleanly, or untidy, whether
you are well, or ill.
Keep your hands, and faces, and hair, and
every part of your bodies quite clean; and
your clothes neat, and in good order.
It is very unpleasant to look at filthy people,
or to be near them.
Children who are keptcleanly and tidy, generally grow much stronger and healthier, and
more cheerful and good humoured, than those
who are seldom cleaned, and who wear very
filthy, ragged clothes.

Creation of HIeaven and Earth.
In the beginning God created the heaven
and the earth. And the earth was without
form and void, and darkness was upon the
face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters. And God said,
Let there be light, and there was light. And
God saw the light, that it was good; and God
divided the light from the darkness, And
God called the light day, and the darkness he
called night. And the eveningand the morning were the -first day.

And God said, Let the earth bring forth
grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit
tree yielding fruit, after his kind, whose seed
is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
And the earth brought forth grass, and herb
yieldingseed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his
kind: and God saw that it was good.
And God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to
rule the night: he made the stars also.
And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth; and to rule
ever the day, and over the inight, and to divide
the light from the darkness: and God saw that
it was good.

and mother say to her. She is not noisy, sullen, nor unmannerly, so that they like to have

at the corlers. She often reads to her parents, atid takes care to mlnd her stops, and to

7The M]oon.
The moon shines to give us light in the
night when the sun is set.  She is very beauitiful and white like silver, we may look at
her always, for she is not so bright as to dazzle our eyes, and she never scorches us, she
lets even the little glow worms shine which
are quite dark by day, the stars shine all around her, but she seems larger and brighter
than the stars, and looks like a large pearl
amongst a great many sparkling diamonds.
WVhen you are asleep she shines through
your curtains with her gentle beams, and.
seems to say, sleep on, poor little tired boy, I
will not disturb you. She shines when every
thing around is still and silent.

To fear the Lord betimes;
WNhile sinners who grow old in sin,
Are -larden'd in their crimes.'Twill save us from a thousand snares
To mind religion young;
It will preserve our following years,
And make our virtues strong.
Let the sweet works of prayer and praise
Employ our youthful breath;

Or fit for eary deathl.'An ti cos ti

Pity.
As blossoms and flowers are strewed upoIn
the earth by the hand of spring, as the kindniess of summer produces in perfection the
bounties of harvest; so the smiles of pity shed
blessings on the children of misfortune.
He who pities another recommends himself; but he who is without compassion deserves it not.
Shut not thine ear therefore against the
cries of the poor; neither harden thy heart
against the calamities of the innocent.

A-ldvice to Youth.
Children obey your parents, and give them
honour, that your days may be long in the
land. Be diligent at your learning, and endeavour to improve, and not spend your time in
idleness and folly. Be kind to your playmates
and friends, and do not hurt or grieve them by
words or actions. Endeavour always to do
good, atld to fly froin evil, and ever preserve a
just sense of right and wrong. But above all,
remember your Creator, the God who made
you, in the days of your youth, and he will
bless you when you come to be old. Always
do good and shun evil, and you shall have a
good name and be happy while you live, and
when you die and leave this world you shall
enjoy eternal and never ending happiness in
the paradise of God.

The Cock.
The Cock is a fowl which lives about the
farm yard. He has white flesh, and a bulky
body.  He has a short strong bill to pick up
grain. He has short wings, and a large red
comb on the topof his head. His tail is large
andtbushy, and he crows every hour after
midnight.19
Improve by other men's faults,. rather than
centsure them.
A good man passeth by an offence, and a
noble spirit scorneth revenge.
Some tllings are good which are not pleasant, other things are pleasant which are not
good; but to live in peace is both good and
pleasant.

With joy he yields his breath.

you may stand in hneed of his help.
If you have done wrong, own your faults;
for he that tells a lie to hide it, makes it worse.
He that tells the truth is a wise child; but
he that tells lies will not be heard when he
speaks the truth.

When I have no crimes to repent,
But reflect on my time and be able to say,
That it has been properly spent.
Whenl my work I have done with patience and
care,
And been good and tlhankful and kind,
I lay on my pillow, and sleep away there,
With a happy and peaceable mind.

On Death.
Trhere is an hour when I mulst die,
Nor do I know how soon'twill come;
How many chiltdren young as I,
Are cal'd by death to hear their doom.
Let stue ir.prove the hours I have,
Betfre the day of grace is fled,
There's no repentance in the grave,
Nor pardon offer'd to the dead.

When he goes to school lhe loves his teachers, and thinks how kind they are to instruct
him. He does not play in school, nor make a
noise, but tries to learn, so that if he should
live to be a man, he may be wise and good.
He never tells a lie, nor departs from the
truth. He loves to read in the bible and other
good books, or to hear other people read in
them.

Wheni he goes to school, he does not mind
what his teacher tells him, but makes a noise,
and does not mind his book, but tells lies and
cheats at play.
When he finds a bird's nest, he takes the
eggs and breaks them, or kills the young birds;
and he is very cruel to all dumb animals, and
always tries to kick and beat them.
Every body that knows this bad boy, tries
to shun him, and nobody likes him, because
he is wicked and cruel.

Let dogs delight to bark and bite,
For this they mostly do;
Let bears and lions growl and fight,
For God has made them so.
But children you should Inever let
Such angry passions rise;
Your little hatnds were never made
To tear each other's eyes.

Let love through all your actions run.

Live like God's well beloved Son,
That sweet and lovely child.

And as in age he grew;
He grew in favour both with man,
And God his Father too.

T'Ihe kingdoml of God is within you, saith
the Lord.
lTurn thee with thy whole heart unto the
Lord, and forsake this world, and thly soul
shall find rest.
Learn to despise outward things and give
thyself to that which is within, and thou shalt
perceive the kin~gdom of God come unto thee.
For he saith, if any man love mc he will
keep my word, and we will coime unto him,
and make our abode with him.
When thou hast Christ thou art rich, atnd
he will suffice thce. He will be thy faithful
helper in all things, so as thou shalt not need
to trust in man.
W'e ought not to put trust in'man, frail and
mortal as he is, though he te friendly and
good; rnor shoul(d we be grievecd if he cross
and oppose us.
Put thy whole trust in G(od, let him be thy
love; he will answer for thee, and do in all
things wuhat is best.

And gather honey all the day
From every opening flow'r.

How neat she spreads the wax,
And labours hard to store it well
With the sweet food she makes.

ar mil lar vPREFACE.
IT has become very common with the compilers of
spelling books, to bcegin with a long enumeration of
faults in the systemls of others, and an apology for thus
intruding upon the public with their own. With
these, however, I shall dispense, and shall only flatter
myself that every attempt to improve and rendei easy
the art of instructing our youtli in the rudiments of
the English language, cannot fail to mleect with etncouragement by a wise, virtuous, an(d enlightened people.
In thl-e first part of the following work the spelling
lessons are arranged from one to six syllables; and an
easy gradation has been observed, so as to keep pace
with the capacity of the learner, without confusing his
ideas too soon with hard and difficult words.
The second part is composed of a table of /irolier
names ofplersons, cities, rivers, mountains, and villages,
regularly arranged, and concluding with a table of
words alike in sound but different in spelling and signification.
The third part is composed of a large table of words
accented an(i explained.
The pronunciation of Walker has been pursued
throughout the work, and the most natural division of
the syllables has been attended to.
In the reading lessons care has been taken to adapt
them to the understanding of children, and the subjeets are such that while they amuse and instruct, they
are calculated to inspire the youthful mind with a love
of virtue aiid truth.
STEPHEN BYERLY;lIooreland, Aptril 25th, 1818.The Hare.
The Hare is a small animal resembling a rab.

Since the days that are past are gone forever,
and those that arc to come may inot come to
thee: therefore, O man! employ the present
time without regretting the loss of that which
is past, or too muc'h depending on that which
is to come.
This instant is thine; the next is in the
womb of fuiturity, and thoul knowest not what
it may bring forth.

Go to the desert, my son; observe the youlng
stork of the wilderness; let himn speak to thine

he lodges him in safety, and supplyeth him
with food.
Be grateful to thy father, for he gave thee
life, and to thy mother for she sustained thee.

If it be difficult to rule thy anger, it is wise
to lrervent it; avoicd therefore all occasions of
ialling into wvrath, or guard thyself against
them when they occur.
A mild answer to an angry mnan, like water
cast upon fire, abateth his hltat; andIl from an
