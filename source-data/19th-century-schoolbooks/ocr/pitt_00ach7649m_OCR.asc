"No, George; I thank God, you do not, my son,; and
I'rejoiee in the hope that you never wvill. Whenever,
by'accident, you do arny thing wrong, which must
often be the case, as you are bhut a poor little boy yet,

a fllsetiood to'conceal it, but come'hbravely up, my
son, like a little man, and tell me of it."
When George was about six years old, he wat
made the'wcalthy master of a hiatchet; of which, like
most little bovs, lie was'inlmoderatelv fond; and was
colnstantly goinlg about'chopp,ing every thing that came
in his way. One day, in the garden, where he often
*amused himself with hacking his mothler's pea-sticks,
he *unluckily'tried the edge of his ihatchet on the'body of a beautifuil voung English cherry-tree, which
he'barked so'terribly,'that I don't believe the tree
ever got the better of it.
The next morning the old gentleman,'finding out
what had'befallen his tree, wbich, by the by, was a
great favourite, came into the house, and, with much
*warmth, asked for the'mischievous'author,'declaring,
at the same time, that he would not have taken five

*traversed thle'immense tract of country fhorn St. Louis
to the head w-aters of the. Missouri alone.--Soon after,
he separated from Dixon, and *trapped in company with
a hunter named Potts; and aware of the *hostility of
the Blackfoot Indians, one of whom had been killed by
Lewis, they set their traps at night, and took them up
early in lhe. morning, remaining *concealed during the
day.
They were *examining their traps early one morning, in a *creek about six miles from that branch of the
Missouri called Jefferson's Forlk, and were asecending
in a canoe, when they suddenly heard a great aoise,
*resembling the *trampling of animals; but they could
not *ascertain the fact, as thle high, perpendicular
banks on each side of th.e river *impeded their view.
Colter immediately *pronounced it to be *occasioned
by Indians, and advised an instant *retreat, but was
accused of *cowardice by Potts, who insisted that the
noise was caused by *buffaloes, and they proceeded
on.
In a few minutes afterwards, their *doubts were removed by a party of Indians making their appearance
on both sides of the creek, to the amoulnt of five or
six hundred, who *beckoned them to come ashore. As
retreat was now impossible, Colter turned the head
of the canoe; and, at the moment of its *touching, an
Indian *seized the *rifle belonging to Potts; but Colter,
who is a remal,rkably strong man, *immediately *retook
it, and *handed it to Potts, who remained in the canoe,
and, on receiving it, *puished off into the river. He. 1 041SlPEJiNt;. [PRONO()A(tUN(IN;(. D1)EINING;. &amp;c.  105

instantly'snatched up the pointed part, with which lie'piuned him to the earth, and then'continued his tlight.
The'foremost of the Indians, arriving at the place,
*stopped till others came up to join them, svhen they
set up a'hideous'yell. Every moment of this time
was'improved by Colter; who, although fainting and
*exhausted, succeeded in gaining the'skirting of the
Cotton-tree wood, on the borders of the Fork, through
which he ran, and plunged into the river.'Fortunately for him, a little bl1ow this place was
an island, against the upper part of which a *raft of'drift timber had'lodged. He dived under the raft,
and, after several efforts, got his head above water
amongst the'trunks of trees, covered otr wiith smaller
wood to the depth of several feet. Scarcely had he'secured himself, w&amp;jathe Indians arrived on the
river, screeching and yelling like so many'fiends.--
They were frequently on the raft, during the day, and
were seen through the'chinks byColter, who was'congratulating himself on his escape, until the'idea arose
that they might set the raft on fire. In horrible'suspense he remained until night, when, hearing no more
of the Indians, he dived under the raft, and swam'silently down the river, to a considerable distance, vwhlere
he'landed, and travelled all night. After seven days'
tedious journeying, he arrived at Lisa's Fort, on the

withlout any sort of'produce for food.'Generally speaking, in a desert there are few'springs of water; some of them at the distance of four,
six, and eight days' journey from  one another, and
not all of sweet water; on the'contrarvy, it is geinerally
salt or bitter; so that, if the thirsty traveller drinks
of it, his thirst is'increased, and he suflfers more than
before.  But when the'calamity happens, that the
next well, which is so'anxiously sought for, is found
dry, the *misery of such a'situation cannot be well
described.  The'camels, wlhich afford the onlS means
of'escape, are so thirsty, that they cannot proceed to
anotlher well; anid if the travellers kill them, to'extract
the little'liquid which remains in their stomachs, they
themselves cannot'advance any further.  The sittation
is dreadfill, and admits of no resource.  Many perish'victims of the most horrible thirst.  It is then that
the value of a cup of water is'really felt.

In such a case, there is no'distinction. If the master
has none, the senrvant will not give it to him; for very
few are the'instances where a man will'voluntarily
lose his life to save that of another. What a situation
for a man, tlloughl a rich one, pertlaps the'owner of
all the'caravan! He is dying for a cup of water--no
one gives it to him; he'offers all he'possesses-no
one hears himn; tllhey are all dving, though, by walking
a few hours further, they might be saved.
In short, tnf be thirsty in a desert, without water,'exposedl to the burning sun, wilt,ollt *shelter, and with
ino hopes of findinig either, is the most'terrible situation
that a mlan can be placed in, and one of the greatest
suffterings that a'humant being can'sustain; the tollgue

"George," said his father. "' do vou know wsho'killed
that beautiful little cherry-tree, yonder in thile garden?"
This was a tough question, and George'staggere(d under
it foir a moment; but quickly recovered himself, and
looking at Iris father, with tile sweet!ace ot youth,'brightened with the'inexpressible charm of all-conqulering truth, he'bravely cried out, " I cRn't tell a lie,
Pa; you ktow I can't tell a lie. I did cut it with my

"Runl to my arms, you dearest boy!" cried his ~ather
in tranlsports, "rut to my arms!'glad am 1, George,
that you killed my tree; for you lhave'p*aid me foJr it a'thllousand fold.  Such an act of'heroism ill my son is
of more worth than a thousand trees, though'blossomed
with silver, and their fruits of purest gold."

ONE day Mr. Washington went into the garden, and'prepared a little bed of'finely pulverized earth, on
which he wrote George's name at'full, in large letters
-then,'strewing i plenty of cabbe  seed, he covered
them up, and smoothed all over nicely with the roller.
This bed he'purposely prepared close along side of
a gooseberry walk, which happening, at this time, to be
well'hung with ripe fruit, he knew would be honoured
with George's visits'pretty regularly every day. Not

" Oh how can I give you any thing, George! I who
have nothing on earth that I can'call my own, no, not

Oh, how could I, my son, have given life to those
great oxen and horses, when I can't give life even to a
fly?--no! for if the'poorest fly were killed, iis not
your father, George, nor all the men in the world, that

Yet Mario might have'escaped, by flying thence;
therefore the action appears to be improper.

and do much mischief.
Yet again, Mario killed him with a pistol, which
he happenled to have in his pocket, since yesterday's
journey: now hereby the whole congregation was
terrified and discomposed, and divine service Wvas
broken off; this carries an appearance of great indecency and'impropriety in it.
But after all, when we consider a flurther circumstance, that Mario, being thus'violently'assaulted by a
mad dog, had no way of escape, and had no other
weapon about bim, it seems to take ass ay all the colours
of impropriety, indecency or unlawfulness, and allows
that the preservation of one, or many lives, will justify
the act as wise and good.
Now all these'concurrent'appendices'of the action
ought to be'surveyed, in order to'pronounce with'justice and truth'concerning it.

SCHOOL BooKs, at the present day, are multiplied to such an
extent, that it seems incumbent on the compiler of a new one to
show clearly his reasons for adding to the number. The following
work has consumed much time, and required no little labour: the
compiler, therefore, in exhibiting what he considers its peculiar
advantages, is, at the samn time, discharging a duty to himiAlf
and to the public
A leading object of this work is to enable the scholar, while
learning to read, to understand, at the same time, the meaning
of the words he is reading. A little reflection will show, that,
when these processes are going on at once, they will mutually
assist each other; if, for example, when the pupil is taught to
read, he is enabled, at the same time, to discover the meaning of
the words he repeats, he will readily make use of the proper
inflections, and place the emphasis where the sense demands it.
The monotonous, sing-song mode of reading, which is common in
schools, and which is often retained in after life, is acquired from
the exercise of reading what is not understood; ani from the
same cause, it is believed, the scholar often carries from the
school a permanent disrelish for books. That disgust, with which
he frequently throws aside his books, at the close of his school,
is to be attributed, very much, to his habit of reading lessonB
above his comprehension.
The bad effects resulting from this practice have led teachers
to adopt one of the only two modes, which have as yet been
invented for avoiding them. They either place in the hands of
their pupils books reduced to the level of their capacities; or, if
the compositions are more elevated, direct them to seek defiutions from the pages of a common dictionary.30

No. 5.-The Golden:Mean.
Wlsr:N the plains of India were'burnt up by a long'drought, Hamnet and Raschid, two neighbouring'shepherds, faint with'thirst, stood at thie common boundary
of tile grounds, with their flocks and'herds'pantingi
round them, and in'extremity of distress, prayed for
wiater. On a sudden, the air was'becalmed, the birds
ceased to chirp, and the flocks to bleat. Tlhey turnied
their eves everv wavy, and saw a being of mighty'statilre
advancintg throiugh the valley, whom thev kilew, on his
nearer approach, to be the'genius of'distribution. In
one hand he held the'sheaves of'plenty, and in the
other the *sabre of destruction.
The shepherds stood trembling, and would have
retired before him: but he called to them with a voice
gentle as the'breeze that plays in the evening among
the spices of SabEa; "a Flee not from your'benefactor,
children of the dust! I am come to offer you gifts,
wlichi only your own folly can make vain. You here
pray for water, and water I will'bestow; let me kniow

consider, that of whatever can be enjoyed by nobody,
*excss is no less danigerous than'scarcity. \When vou

of'sufobcation. Now, tiaimet, tell me your request."

Rasehid repeated his desire, and pleased hinself

PREFACE.
The design of the present volume is to unite the advantages
of both these plans. The difilcult words are rendered intelligible
by the definitions; and by learning the definitions, the minds of
the scholars are exercised, and their knowledge of language increased.
The common mode of teaching the definitions of words is also
very objectionable; the pupil is obliged to commit to memory
the definitions of a certain number of insulated and unconnected
wcrds, in a dictionary; this is a mere exertion of the memory;
and that it is a tedious, and often a most fruitless labour, both
teachers and pupils will, we believe, concur in admitting. The
difficulty grows out of the fact, that, yv, his exercise, the association of ideas is not called in to the ass,stance of the memory:
and, when the pupil strives to recover the evanescent idea, there
are no associated circumstances-no train of ideas, on, which hle
can rely for assistance.
The plan of the present work relieves the schlolar from this
dfiMculty. It presents the word to be defined in connexion with
others, and supplies a train of ideas, with which the word itself
may be associated. For example, let us suppose, that our pupil
meets the original word with its definition in any of the interesting extracts which follow; will not that definition be retainedc
in his memory a longer time than if he had acquired it from a,
dictionary? In the latter case, the pupil has only the appearanec
and the sound of the word to aid his memory; and if these do not
recall the lost idea, it is gone forever; in the former, the memory
derives assistance not only from the sound and shape of the word,
but from the interesting circumstances of the story occurring to
his recollection, and from the definition, supplied by recalling the
idea, which the original word represented.
In regard to orthography, the compiler would observe, that the
plan of spelling from the reading lessons brings before the mind
of the learner many derivativ6s, and inflections of words, which
are not found in the dictionary,-besides, it occurs to him, as he
thinks it must to every instructcr of youth, that, when a child is40)

taught to spell words withoult knowing their meaning, it is a dry
and laborious task; one which affords to the scholar neither
pleasure nor mental improvement, and which requires to be often
repeated without perceptible benefit. If, when the pupil is taught
to spell a particular word, he is taught to pronounce, read, define,
vary its mraninig, trace it to its 7root, or follow out its derivatives,
as the case may be, it would seem, that he must retain a clearer
idea of its orthography than when he has repeated it by rote
from the columns of a spelling book or dictionary.
In some cases, perfectly easy words are transferred to the right
hand page, not with a view to be defined merely, but to be connected wit'h synonymes of dlifficult explanation; so that the plain
words may act as interpreters, and furnish to the pupil a more
extended acquailltance with language: in other cases, a word has
been defined by a number of words nearly synonymous, in order
that the scholar may exercise his judgment in making the selection, and thus cultivate a habit of discriminating between different
shades of thought.
A large number of words have been marked to be varied, or
thrown into sentences, in which they shall exhibit a variety of
significations. This exercise will illustrate the importance of attention to the situation of words, and to the various thoughts, or
shades of thought, which the same word may be made to convey.
It is also intended, that the mind of the pupil shall be frequently
turned to the etymology of the language--not only as being in
itself a profitable and interesting exercise, but as enabling the
scholar to arrive at the derivations and compositions of words,
which are not found in the dictionaries.
Walker's pronunciation has been adopted, as it is now the
generally received standard;-and his mode of teaching it has
been followed, from a belief, arising from the compiler's own
experience, that it is more simple, and that it leaves more permanent impressions, than the later systems.

But to place the suibject in a clearer lig[ht, we will give an
instance combining the several' advantages, which wo conceive to
belong to the plan we have delineated. Let us take the phrase,
"e The converse of friends."
In the first place, the word'converse' may be pronounced both
as a noun and a verb; konl'verse, kon-vorsel.
In the next place, it lmay be defined by'communion,' sociaI
intercourse,''familiarity,' &amp;c.-and thus, ever after, the meaning
of these words will be associated together. Again-it imay be
varied as a verb,'to commune with,''to talk;' anid as a noun,'that which is directly contrary.' After this examination, he
will very easily spell it; anid, lastly, he may be required to enumerate its derivatives, as-conversableness, conversable, conversably, conversation, conversant, conversative, conversion, conversive, conversely.
From  such a varied process, the scholar will dcrive mriel
pleasure; he will settle in his mind the cxact meae.ing of thle
wvord-his stock of langll age will be enlarged, and the range of
his ideas extended. in slhort, by making a complete analysis of
a sentence on tlhis plai, lie -will have gone through a process,
which has brought into exercise nearly all the faculties of his
mind; anld to brilng out.;, in their proportion, the powvers of the
young schoilar-to lead hlim to think, and to investi,gate every
tiliing that:leets his notice, ought to be the great end of every
branceh of instruction.
It was observed in the preface to the first editio- of this work,
that, " should the plan of this work be favourably received by the
public, it will probably be ifollowed by another lvouumc, in wIhich
the design will be so far extended as to embrace'the explanation
of phrases and figurative language." The compiler has occasion
gratefully to acknowledge the favourable reception of this work;
he has, therefore, been encouraged to commence the contemplated
vrolume, which will shortly be published.READIN G.

could buy. WlShen tlhey'reachud the next town, Zimur

and his activity.
As soon as he was  one,adir and Haran'fixed their
eyes upon the treasure, and sat sometime silent.  At
length they stole a'glance at each other; each was
conlscious of his own wish, and thought he saw it'refleeted from the countenance of his friend.
They began a conversation, in which this wish was

They aih adtivance in the same direction, climbing
over every *obstacle in their progress, clearing the
ground of every *vegetable substance, *consunling even
the bark of the trees, and *announcing their appr6ach,
at a considerable distance, by the noise of feeding.
" The land is as the garden of *Eden before them, and
behind them a *desolate wilderness."
In order to give a new direction to their course,
the *inhabitants are accustomed to dig pits and *trenches across their paths, which they fill with water, or
with *coimbustible *naterials, to be set on fire at their
approach; but so *immense are the numbers of these
"destroyers, and so eagerly do they *press forward
their *ranks, that the trenches are soon filled, and the

Still more favorable to the'religious character of the
husbandman, is the'circumstance, that, from the nature
of'*agricultural'pursuits, they do not so completely'engross the attention as other'occupations.  They

IN 1754, Washington was'stationed at Alexandria
with a regiment, of which he was'Colonel. At an
election for members of the Assembly, Washington
was in favor of Colonel G. Fairfax; and Mr. W. Payne'headed the'friends of William Elzey.
In the course of the'contest, Washington grewv
Narm, and said something'offensive to Mr. Paynf,
who'elevated his cane, and, at one blow, extended our
hero on the ground.
News was soon carried to the regiment, that their
commander was'mulrdered by the mob. In a moment
the whole regiment was under arms, and in rapid nsolion towards the town,'burning for *vengeance. During this time, Washington was so far'recovered as to
go out and meet his'enraged'soldiers, who'crowded
aronmd him with joy to see him alive.SPELLING, PRONOVJNCING3, DEFINING, &amp;c. 79

Feeling himself the'aggressor, lihe resolved to make
ir. Payne the honorable'reparation of askiing his pardon.'Early next morniitg, he wrote a polite note to
Mr. Payne, to meet him at the tavern.
Payne took it for a'challenge, and'repaired to the
tavern in full expectation of smelling guanpowder. But
what was his'surprise, on entering the chamber, to
see, in'lieu of a'brace of pistols, a decanter of wiec
and a pair of glasses oni the table.
Washington rose to meet him, and, offering his hand

No. 17.--The 1Wild Girl.
IN 1731, as a *nobleman was *shooting at Songi, near
Chalons, in Champaigne, he saw, at a distance in the
s-vater, sometneing w iceh he took for a *couple of birds,
and at which he *fired.
The *supposed bi:ds *avoided the shot by *diving,
an4 frising at another place, made to the shore; when
it appeared that they were two children, nine or ten
yeats of age.
One otu these children *returned to thle river, and was
never afterwards seen; the other went to the *village
of Songi.  The tinhilabitants were *frightened at her
singular aptesw::drhe*
They set a grea:t dog at her; but she waited his *attack without stirring from her place, and, as soon as
he was within reach, gave him such a blow with her
club, as laid him dead on the spot.
Unable to gain *admission into any house, she returned into the fields, *climbed up a tree, and there took
her *repose.
The Viscount d'Epinoy offered a *reward to any one
who would catch thif wild girl.  At length she was'allured to come down by a woman who walked under
the tree with a child in her arms, and offered her fish
and *roots.
When she had *descended, some persons lying in
*wait seized her, and *conveyed her to the Viscount's
seat. At first, she was taken into the kitchen, where
she fell upon some wild fow-1, and ate them up before
the cook *missed them.SPELLING, PRONOUNCING, DEFINING, &amp;c.  91

The Viscount delivered her to the care of a shepherd, *recommending to him to be *extremely *attentive
to her, under a *promise of paying him well for his
trouble.
It *cost a great deal of trouble to render her a little
tame. Once she iele?ned in a severe frost, during a
heavy fall of snow,,-V:l after a long search, was found
sitting on a tree in t'4 open fields.
Nothing was moro *astonishing than the swiftness
and *agility with vwi:h  she ran.  She did not take
long steps, like other people, but her run was rather
a flying trip, which w.s more like *gliding than walking.
Several ye,l'rs aifter:;he had been *caught, she was
capabie of'outstripig;i, wild animals, which she proved
to the Queen of Poland in 1737: being talken ouit on
a hunting party, she ran after rabbits and hares that
were started, caught them *presently, and brought them
to the Queen.
In her savage state, she had no *language, but a sort
of wild scream, which sounded *frightfully when she
was in anger, and particularly when a *stranger attempted to take hold of her.
Long afterwards, her speech had something wild,
abrupt, and childish; but when she was a little *civilized, she appeared to be a *quick, lively girl.
There was nething, from which she wvas more *difficult to be *weaned, than eating flesh and *vegetabies
*raw. Her stomach could not bear *dressed *victuals.SPELLING, PRONOUNCING, DEFINING, &amp;c.  9S

Once the Viscount had a great *deal of company,
and she sat at table with them. None of the high
"seaso.ned dishes being to her taste, she started up,
*vanished like lightning, filled her apron with live
frogs from the nearest *pool, hastened back, and *bet:o -ed them  melnlg the guests with a'liberal hand,
joyjfullye,:clir-oin;'--" Here, here, take some!"
Ini the ye-' 1732, this *remarkable maiden was bhapbized by the n.ine of Maria le Blanc. On account of
the"hange iln ier mode of life, she was often *ill, and,
ifter the death of her *patron, spent the remainder of

*'schweitz, shwits'situated between the lakes otf Zug and Lowertz on two
sides, and the'mountains of Rigi and Rossberg oin the

and a boad'waste of ruiins, burying alive n-re than

About five o'clock in the evening of the 3d of Scptember, a large'pr jtectilon of the mounitain of Ilossberg, on the northl-east, gave wvay, and'precipitated
itself into this valley; and, in less than foiur minutes,

The'force of the earth must have been'prodigious,
since it not onlyv spread over the'hollow1 of the valley,
but even'asceneded far up the opposite side of the

*calculated that a fifth part is filled up. On a *minute
map, you will see two little *islands marked in this lake,
which have been admired for their *picturesqueness.
One of them is famous'or being the *residence of two
hermits; and the other, for the *remains of au ancient
*chateau, once belonging to tie house of Hapsburg.
So large a body of water was raised and pushed
forward by te falling of such a mass into the *Iake,
that the two islands, and the whole village of Seven,
at the southern extremity, were, for a time, completely
*submerged by the passing of the *swell.  A large
house in this village was lifted off its *foulndations, and
carried half a mile beyond its place.  The hermits
were absent on a'pilgri-mage to a distant'abbey.
The *disastrous consequences of this event extended further than the loss of such a number of inhabita-nts in a canton of little population. A fertile plain
is at once *converted into a barren tract of rocks and
*calcareous earth, and the former marks and *bouldaries of property *obliterated.  The *main road from
Art to Sch-weitz is completely filled up, so thfat a-iother must be *opened, with great labour, over +tlie ligi.
The former *chantnel of a large strearn is *choked up,4
and its course altered; and as the *outlets Cand passage
of large bodies of water must be'affected by the lling
up of such a portion of the lake, the'neighboring
villages are still trembling with apprehension of some
remote consequence, against which they know   not
how to provide.   Several hundred mien. have been
