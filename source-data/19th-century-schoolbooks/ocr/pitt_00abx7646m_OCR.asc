that this is the only law which ought to be prescribed; that
all artificial rules are useless; and that good sense, and a
cultivated taste, are the only requisites to form a good
public speaker. But it is true in the art of speaking, as
well as in the art of living, that general precepts are of
little use till they are unfolded, and applied to particular
cases. To observe the various ways by which nature expresses the several perceptions, emotions and passions of
the human mind, and to distinguish these from the mere
effede of arbitrary custom or false taste; to discover and
corredt those tones, and habits of speaking, which are
gross deviations from nature, and as far as they prevail
muanst destroy all propriety and grace of utterance; and to
mnake choice of such a course of praatical lessons, as shall
give the speaker an opportunity of exercising himself in
each branch of elocution: all this must be the effet of attention and labour; and in all this much assistance mnay
certainly be derived froin'instrudtion. What are rules or
lessons for acquiring this or any other art, but the observations ofothers, colleced into a narrow compass, and
digested into a natural order, for the diredion of the unexperiernced and unpra6ised learner? And what is thlere in
the art of speaking, which should render it incapable of
receiving aid from precepts?
PRESuMINIG then, that the acquisition of the art of
speaking, like all other praatical arts, may be facilitated
by rules, I proceed to lay before my readers, in a plain
didacic form, such rules respeaing elocution, as appear
best adapted to form a correc% and gracef'ul Speaker.

Yet few attain it, if'twas e'er attain'd.
But they the widest wander from the mark,
Who thro' the flow'ry paths of saunt'ring Joy
Seek this coy Goddess; that from stage to stage
Invites us still, but shifts as we pursue.
For, not to name the pains that pleasure brings
To counterpoise itself, relentless Fate
Forbids that we thro' gay voluptuous wilds
Should ever roam: And were the Fates more kind,
Our narrow luxuries would soon be stale.
W~ere these exhaustless, Nature would grow sick),

The praise that's worth ambition, is attain'd
By sense alone, and dignity of mirnd.
VIRTUE, the strength -andcl beauty of thie soull
Is the best gift of heaven: a happiness
That even above the smiles and frowns of fate
Exalts great Nature's favourites: a wealth
That ne'er encumbers, nor to baser hands
Can be transferr'd: it is the only good
l'Ian justly boasts of, or can call his own.
Riches are oft by guilt and baseness earn'd;
Or dealt by chance, to sliiekl a lu-cky knave,
Or throw a cruel sunshine on a fool.
But for one end, one much-negle-ted use,
Are riches worth your care (for nature's wants
Are few, aind withoult opulence supplied)
This noble end' is, to produce the Soul  
To shew the virtues in their fairest light;
To make Humanity the Minister
Of bounteous Providence; and teach the breast
That generous luxury the Gods enjoy.

discover and correCt those faults in' articulation, which,
though often ascribed to some defeAt in the organs of
speech, are generally the consequence of inattention or
bad example. Many of these respe&amp; the sounding of the
tonsonants.  Some cannot pronounce the letter 1, and
others the simple sounds r, s, th, sh; others generally
omit the aspirate h. These faults may be correated, by
reading sentences, so contrived as often to repeat the faulty sounds; and by guarding against them in familiar conversation.
OTHER defe&amp;es in articulation regard the complex
sounds, and consist in a confused and cluttering pronunciation of words. The most effe6lual methods of conquering this habit, are, to read aloud passages chosen for
that purpose (such for instance as abound with long and
unusual words, or in which many short syllables come together) and to read, at certain stated times, much slower
than the sense and just speaking would require. Almost
all persons, who have not studied the art of speaking,
have a habit of uttering their words so rapidly, that this
latter exercise ought generally to be:made use of for a considerable time at first: for where there is a uniformly rapid
utterance, it is absolutely impossible that there should be
strong emphasis, natural tones, or any just elocution.

Beyond the pow'r of language, will unfold
The form of beauty smiling at his heart,
How lovely! how commanding! But tho' Heav'n
In every breast hath sown these early seeds
Of love and admiration, yet in vain,
Without fair culture's kind parental aid,
Without enlivening suns, and genial show'rs.

Or yield the harvest promis'd in its spring.

Repay the tiller's labour; or attend

Incline to diff'rent objeas: one pursues

Another sighs for harmony, and grace,
And gentlest beauty. Hence when lightning fires

ON ANGER.
QUE. STION. W    HETHER Anger ought to be suppressed
entirely, or only to be confined within:
the bounds of moderation i
I'HOSE wUho maintain that resentnaent is blameable only
in the excess, support their opinion with such arguments as
these:
SINCE Anger is natural and useful to nman, entirely to
banish it from our breast, would be an equally foolish and
vain attempt: for as it is difficult, and next to impossible,
to oppose nature with success; so-it were imprudent; if we
had it in our power, to cast away the weapons with which
she has furnished us for our defence. The best armour
against injustice is a proper degree of spirit, to repel the
wrongs that are done, or: designed against us: but if we di-.
vest ourselves of all resentment, w-e shall perhaps prove too
iriresolute and languid, both in resisting the attacks of injus.
tice, -and infli&amp;ting punishment upon those, who have committed it. WVe shall therefore sink into contempt, and by
tlhe tameness of our spirit, shall invite the malicious to abuse
and a6lhont us. Nor nill others fail to deny us the regard
which is due from tlhem, if once they think us incapable of
resentment. To remain unmoved at gross. injuries, has the
appearance of stupidity, and will make us despicable and
mean, in the eyes of many who are not to be influenced -by
any thing but their fearls.

The virtue of mildiness is no less remote fIrom insensibnlity9
on the one hand, than ofiomfiury on the other. It. iplies,
that we are anlgry only upon proper occasion;s, and in a due

and confess it openly, as what we count l.ahudibie and mreTitorio us.
THE truth is, the're seems i to he something manly, a-nd

You tell us, anger is natural to man; but nothing is more
natural to man, -than reason,- mildness and benevolnence,'Now with what proprie-ty can we call that natural to any
creature, whlich impairs and opposes the most essential and
distinguishing parts of its constitution? Somretimes indeedi
we mnay call that natural to a species, whicla bei:ng found ini
miost of them, is not produced by airt or ctstom. That anger
is in this sense natural, we readily grant; but deny that we
therefore cannot, or may not lawsvully extinguish it. Nature
has committed to our management the. faculties of the mind,
as well as the menimbers of the body: and., as when any of
the latter become pernicious to thie whole, we cut them off
and cast them away; in like manner, when anly of our affeationS are becorte hurtful and useless i,n our firame, by
cu,tting- them off, we do not in the least coumteraet the intention of nature. Now such is-an,er to a 4isea man.'tb

his friends, disturb his lreason, and,unfit him for discharging the duties of liie in a becomingr maun:e.r. By onlyi cdiminishing his passion, he may lessen, but cannot remove -the
evil; for the only way to get clear of the one, is by entirely dismissing tihe other.
-low then will anWger be so useful to him, as to make it
worth his while to retain it in any dlegree? I-He may defend
his own rights; assist an injured friciend; prosecute and putl
nish a villain; I say his prudeL nce and ifiendship, his public
spirit anr( calin resolution;vill enable hini to do all this, and
to do it in a much.more safe, proper, and effed&amp;ual manner,
without the assistance of anger, than with it. He will be
despised and negle&amp;ed, youL say, if he appears to have no
resentnmeant. -You should ratlier say, if he appears to have
no sedate wvisdom and courage; for thiese qualities will be
sufficient of themselves to secure him fiom-n contempt, and
n-aintain him in the possesssion of his just authority. Nor
does any thing commonly lessen us more in tl:e eyes of
others, thain our own passion. It often exposeth us to the
contempt and derision of th ose, who are not in our powter;
and if it makes'us feared, it also makes us proportionably
lhmted, by our inferiors and dependants. Let the influence
it gives us be ever so g,reat, that man  must pay very dear for

and feeble utterance, that they appear neither to under.
stand or feel what they say themselves, nor to have any
desire that it should be understood or felt by their audience. This is a fundamental fault: a speaker without
energy, is, a lifeless statue.
IN order to acquire a forcible manner of pronouncing
your words, inure yourself, while reading, to draw in as
much air as your lungs can contain with case, and to expel it with vehe-mence, in uttering those sounds which
require an.emphact'al, pronunciation; read aloud in the
open air, and with all the exertion you can comlmand;
preserve your bodly in an erea attituee while you are
speaking; let all the consontant souinds be expressed with
a full impulse or percussion of the breath, and a forcible
a&amp;ion of the org.ans employed in rforming them; and let
all the vow.el sounds liave a full and bold utterance. Practise these rules with perseverance, till you have acquired
strength and -energy of speech.
BUT in observing this rule, beware of running into the
extreme of vociferation. Wee find this fault chiefly among'
those, who, in contempt and despite of all rule and propriety, are determined to command the attention of the
vulgar. These are the ispeakers, who, in Shakespear's
phrase, 6&lt; offend tne judicious hearer to the soul, by tearing a passion to rags, to very tatters, to split the ears of
the groundlings."  Cicero compares such speakers to
cripples who get on horse-back because they cannot walk:
they bellow, because they cannot speak.

BESIDES, the imitation of anger, which is easily -formed,
will produce the same effeda upoll others, as if the passion
wras real. If therefore to quicken the slow, to rouse the inattentive, and restrain the fierce, it is sometimes expedient
that tlhey believe you are moved, you may put on the outward aT-ppearance of resentment. Thus you may obtain the
end of anger. without the danger antd vexation that attends
it and may preserve your authority, without forfeiting the
peace of your nmind.
HowF.vF:r manly and vigorouis anger may be thought, it
is in fa&amp;, but a weak principle, compared with t).e sedate
resolution of a wise and virtuous man. The one is luniform
and permanent like the stirength of a person in perfe&amp;t health;
the otler, like a force which proceedeth from a fever, is
violent for a time, but it soon leaves the mind more feeble
than before. To him therefore who is armned with a proper
firmness of soul, no degt'ee of passion cani be useilui in any
respea. And to sav it can ever be laudable and virtuous isindeed a sufficiently bold assertion. For the most part we
blame it in others, and though we are apt to be indulgent
enough to our own faults, we are often ashamed of it in ourselves. Hence it is common to hear men excusing themselves, and seriously declaring, they were not angry, when
they have given unqu,estionable )proofs to the contrary. But
do we not commend him, who resents the injuries done to a
friend or innocent person? Yes, we commend him; yet
not for his passion, but for that generosity ancl friendship
of which it is the evidence. For let any one impartially consider, which of these chara6ters he esteems the better; his,
who interests himself in the injuries of his fi-iend, and zealously defends him with perfe6t calmness and serenity of
temper; or hi3s who ptursues the same co nduCa under the
influence of resentment.
IF anger then is neither useful nor commendable, it is,certainly the part of wisdom to suppress it entirely. We
should rather confine it, you tell us, within certain bounds.
But how shall we ascertain the limits, to which it may, and
beyond which it ought not to pass? WNhen we receive a manifest injury, it seems we may resent it, provided we do it
with moderation. When we suffer a worse abuse, our anger, I suppose, may rise somewhat higher. Now as the de.
grees of injustice are infinite, if our anger must always be
proportioned to the occasion, it may possibly proceed to the
utmost extravagance. Shall we set bounds to -our resentuChap. I      ARGUMENTATIVE PIECES.                   -3
ment while we are yet calm'? how can we be: assured, that
being 1once let loose, it will not carry us beyond them?- or,shall we give passion the reins, imagining we can resume
them. at pleasure, or trusting it will tire or stop itself as soon
as it has run to its proper lengtih? A  w? Il might we think
of giving la,ws to a tempest; as well might.we endeavour to
run mad bty rule and miethod.
IN re-ality, it is mIuch easier to keep ourselves void of resentment, than to restrai. it f1romi excess, when it has gained
admission; for if reason, wiiie her strength is yet entires
is not able to preserve her Ldomi;on, whet can she do when
herenemy has in part preaailed and weakened her force?
To use the illustration of an excellent author, we can prevent
the beginnings of some things, whose progress afterwards
wve cannot hinder. AVe can forbear to cast ourselves down
from a precipice, but if once we have taken the fatal leap,
we must descend, whethel we Will or no. Thus the mind,
if duly cautious) may stand firm ulpon the rock of tranquility;
but if she rashly forsakes the- summnlit, she can scarce recowver.herself, but is hurried away down.warlds   by her- own pas;sion, with increasing violence.
Do not say thlat we exhort you to attemnpt that which is
impossible. Nature has put it in our povwer to re.si the motions of anger; W e only pleadl inability, when we want an
excuse for our own negligence. W,TIas a passionate a man ie
forfeit a hundred poundcis, as o(tei, a5 ie was angry, or was.he sulre he must die the next nmoment after the first sally of
i.is passion, we.should find, he had a great commiand of his
temper, whenever he could prevail upon himself to exercise
a proper attention about it. And shall we not esteem it wvorthy of equal attention, worthy of our utmost care andc pains,
to.obtain that immoveable tranquility of mind, without
-which we cannot relish either life itself, or any of its enjoyrnents?--Upon thile whole then, we both may and oughtg
niot merely to restrain, but extirpate anger. It is impatient
of rule; in proportion as it prevails, it will disquiet our
minds; it has nothing commendable in itself, nor will, it
ansvwer anly valu;,ble purpose in.life.

of commerce; by the-general intercourse of arts and letters; by that common nature, of which we all participate?

which the times andl seasons ever uniformly pass?--Were
this order once confounded, I could not probably survive

A  LL men pursue Good, and would be happy, if they
knew how; not- happy for minutes and miserable for
hours; buthappy, if possible, through every part of their
existence. Either therefore there is a good of this steady
durable kind, or there is none. If none, then all good must
be transient and uncertain; and if so, an object of lowest
value, which can little deserve either our attention or inquiry. But if there be a better good, such a good as we are
seeking;; like every other thing, it must be derived from
some cause; and that cause must be either external, internal, or mixed, in as much as except these three, there is no
other possible. Now a steady, durable good, cannot be derived -fiom an external cause, by reason all derived firom externals must flu6tuate, as they fluauate. By the same rule,
not from a mixture of the two; because the part which is
external will proportionally destroy its essence. Wlhat then
remains but the cause internal; the very cause which we
have-supposed, when we place'the Sovereign Good in Mind

can we find that wisdom which shines through all his works}
in the formation of man, without looking on this world as
only a nursery for the next, and believing that the several
genetations of rational creatures, which rise up/and disalppear in such quick successions, are only to receive their first
rudiments of existence here, and afterwards to be transplanted into a more friendly climate, where they may spread
and flouris-h towall eternity?
THERE is not, in my opinion, a more pleasing and tri.
umphant consideration in religion, than this of the perpetual
progress which the soul miakes towards the perfeation of its
nature, without ever arrivinlg at a period in it. To look
upon the soul as going on from strength to stren-gth, to con.
sider that she is to shine for ever with new accessions of glory, and brighten to all eternity; that she will be still adding
virtue to virtue, and knowledge to knowledge; carries in it
something wonderfully ag'reeable to that ambition which is
natural to the mind of mana. Nay, it must be a prospe6
pleasing to God himself, to see his creation for ever beautifying in his eyes, and drawing nearer to him, by greater
degrees of resemblance.
METHINKIS this single consideration, of the progress of a
finite spirit to perfe6tion, will be sufficient to exting'uish all
envy in infeirior natures, and all contempt in superior. That
cherubim, which now appears as a God to a humnan soul,
knows vei y well that the period will come about in eternity,.
when the human soul sliall be as perfeat as he hinaself now'
is: nay, when she sha11 look1 down upon that degr ee of perfeRtion, -as much as she now falls short of it. It is true, the
higher nature still advances, and Iby tliat means preserves his
distance and superiority in the scale of being; but he knows
that, how high soever the station is of which he stands possessed at Frescnt, the inferior natuire wvill at length nmount
up to it, and shine forth in the same degree of glory.
WVITrI what astonishmient and veneration mnay we look

and knowledge, si.ch inexhausted sources of perfe&amp;dions!

LUCRETIA.
Y  ES, noble lady, I swear by this blood, which was once
so pure, and which. iothing- but royal villainy could
have polluted, that I.will pursue Lucius Tarquinius the
proud, his wickecl wife, and tlheir~ children, with fire and

other whatsoever, to be King in Rome.&lt; Ye Gods, I call you
to witness this my oath!-There Romans, turn your eyes
to that sad speEtacle--the daughter of Lucretius, Collatinus's
wvife-she died by her own hand. - See there a noble lady
whom the lust of a Tarquin reduced to the necessity of being
her own executioner, to attest ber innocence. Hospitably
entertained by her as a kinsman of her husband's, Sextus,
the perfidious guest, became her brutal ravisher. The chaste,
the generous Lucretia could not survive the insult. Glo-rious
woman! *But once only treated as a slave, she thought life
no longer to be endured. - Lucretia, a woman, disdained a
life that depended on a tyrant's will; and shall we, shall
men, with such an example before our eyes, and after fiveand-twenty years of ignominious servitude, shall we through,
a fear of dying, defer one single instant to assert our liberty? No, Romans, now is the time; the favourable imoment
we have so long waited for is come.. Tarquin is inot at Rome

who have ever been so brave when foreign enemies were tobe

HIANNIBAL TO HIS SOLDIERS.
T KNOW not, soldiers, whether you or your prisoners be
encompassed by fortune with the striater bounds and neCessities. Two seas enclose you on the right and left;--
not a ship to flee to for escaping. Before you is the Po, a
river broader and more rapid than the Rhone; behind you
are the Alps, over which, even when your numbers were
undimini-shed, you were hardly able to force a passage.
Here then, soldiers, you must either conquer or de,- the
very first hour you meet the enemy. But the same.- fortune
which has thus laid you under the necessity of fighting, has.
set before your eyes those rewards of viEtory, than which
no men are ever wontto wish for greater firom the immortal
Gods. Should we by 9ur valour recover only Sicily and

or if they attempt variety, it is only In proportion to the
number of their hearers, and the extent of the place in
which they speak; imagining, that speaking in a high key
is the same:thing as speaking loud: and not, observing,
that whether a speaker shall be heard or not, depends
more upon the distin&amp;tness and force with which he utters
his Words, than upon the height at which he pitches his
voice.'BuT it is an essential qualification of a good speaker,
to be able to alter the height, as well as the strength and
the tone of his voice, as occasion requires. Different
species of speaking require different heights of voice.
Nature instruas us to relate a story, to support an argument, to command a servant, to utter exclamations of
anger or rage, and to pour forthl lamentations and,sorrow,
not only with different tones, but different elevations of
voice. Men at different ages of life, and in different situations, speak in very different keys.  The vagrant,
when he begs; the soldier, when he gives the word of
command; the watchman, when he announces the hour
of the night; the sovereign, when he issues his edict;
the senator, when he harangues: the lover, when he
whispers his tender tale; do not differ more in the tones
which they use, than in the key in which they speak.
Reading and speaking, therefore, in which all the variations of expression in real life are copied, must have
continual vairiations in the height of the voice.
To acquire the power of changing the key on which
you speak at pleasure, accustom yourself to pitch your
voice in different keys, from the lowest to the highest
notes you can command. Many of these would neither
be proper nor agreeable in speaking; but the exercise will
give you such a command of voice, as is scarcely to be acquired by any other method. Having repeated this experiment till you can speak with ease at several heights of
the voice; read, as exercises on this rule, such compositions as have a variety of speakers, or such as relate di102   ORATIONS       AND    HARANBsGUES.        B/ook h7V
Sardinia, which were ravished from our fathers, those would
be no inconsiderable prizes. Yet what are these? The
wealth of Rome, whatever riches she has heaped together
in the spoils of nations, all these, with the masters of themr
will be yours. Yolu have been long enough employed in
driving the cattle upon the vast mountains of Lusitania and
Celtiberia; you have hitherto met with no reward worthy
of the labouts and dangers you have undergone. The time
is now come to reap the full recompense of your toilsome
mTarches over so many mountains and rivers, and through
so nm[any nations, all of thermr in arms. This is the place
which fortune has appointed to be the limits of your labours;
it is here that you will finish your glorious warfare, and receive an ample recompense of your compleated service.
For I would not have you imagine, that vi&amp;ory will be as
diffic.ult as the name of a Roman war is great and soundling.
It has often happened that a despised enemy has given a
bloody battle, and the most renowned kingis and nations have
by a small force been overthrown. And if you but take
away the,glitter of the Roman name, what is there, wherein they may stand in competition with you? For to say nothing of your service in war for twenty years togethor-vith

now to fight? V'ith raw soldiers, an undisciplined army.,
beaten, vanquished, besieged by the G(auls the very last
sulmmer, an army unknown to tliheir leader, and unacquainted with him.
Ot shall I, who was born I might almzost say, but certainly brought up, in the tent of my father, that most excelkent general, sl-ill I, the conqueror of Spain and Gaul, and
not only of the Alpine nations, but which is greater yet,
of the Alps themselves, shall I cnompare myself with this
~half-year captain? A captain? before whom should one place,the two. armies without their ensigns, I am persuaded he
would not know to which of them he is consul? I esteeua
it no small advantage, soldiers, that there is not one among
you, who has'not often been an eye witness of my exploits
inwar; not one of whose valour I myself have not been a
-spe&amp;tator, so as to be able to name the times and places of
his noble atchievements; that witll soldiers, whom I have

ON what side soever I turn my eyes, I behold all full of
courage and strength; a veteran infantry; a most gallant
cavalry; you, my allies, most faithful and valiant; you, Carthaginians, whom not only your country's cause, but the
justest anger impels to battle. The hope, the courage of
assailants, is always greater than of those who aat upon the
defensive. With hostile banners displayed, you are come
down upon Italy; you bring the war. Grief, injuries, indignities fire your minds, and spur you forward to revenge!
-First they demanded im n; that I, your general, should be
delivered up to them; next, all of you, who had fought at
the siege of Saguntum; and were to be put to dleath by the
extremest tortures. Proud and cruel nation' E-very thing
must be yours, and at your disposal! You are to prescribe
to us with whomn we shall make war, with whom we shall
make peace! You are to siet us bounds; to shut us up within hills and rivers; but you-you are not to observe the
limits wliich yourselves have fixed! Pass- hot the Iberus.
What next? Touch not the Saguntines; Saguntum is upon
the Iberdus, move not a step towards the city. Is it a small
matter then, that you have deprived us of our ancient possessions, Sicily and Sardinia; you wo-uldt have Spain too?
Well, we shall yield Spain; and then-you will pass into
Africa. WTill pass, did I say?-rThis very year they ordered one of their consuls into Africa, the other into Spain.
No soldiers, there is nothing left*for us but wvhat we can
vindicate with our swords. Come on then. Be men. The
Romans may with more safety be cowards; thley have their
own country behind them, have places of refuge to flee to
and are secure from danger in the roads thither; but for
you there is nio middle fortune between death and vi&amp;torv.
Let this be but well fixed in your minds) and once again I

stand candidates for places of power and trust, before, and
after their obtaining them. They solicit them in one manner, and execute them in anothey. They set out with a
great appearance of ativity, humnility, and moderation
and they quickly fall into sloth, pride, and avarice. It is
undoubtedly, no easy matter to discharge, to the general
satisfa-tion, the duty of a supreme commander in troublesome times. I am, I hope, duly sensible of the importance
of the offce I propose to take upon me, for the service of
my country. To carry on, with effeCt, an expensive war,
and yet be frugal of the public money; to oblige those to
serve, whom it may be delicate to offend; to conduEt, at
the same time, a complicated variety of operations; to concert measures at home answerable to the state of things
abroad; and to gain every valuable end, in spite of opposition fioom the envious, the fations, anl thle disaffCled;  to
do all this, ray countrymen, is more dii-cult, than is generally thought. And, besides the disadvantages, which are
common to me vwith all others in emineent stationls, my case
is, in this respeC, peculiarly hard; that, whereas a commander of Patrician rank, if he is guilty of a neglet, or
breach of duty, has his great conne6tions, the antiquity of
his famiiy, the important services, of his ancestors, and the
multitudces v has by power engagedl in his interest, to screen
him from. condign punishmnent: my whole safety depends
upon mayself; wlicch renders it the more indispensably necessary for me to take care, that my conduCt be clear anrl
unexceptionable. Besides, I am well aware, my countryrnen, that the eye of the public is upoin me; and that,
though the impartial, who prefer the real advantage of the
common  wealth to all other considerations, favouLr my pretensions, the Patricians want notlsing so much, as an occasion against me. It is, therefore, my fixed resolution, to
use my best endeavours, that you be not disappointed in
me, and that their indiret designs against me may!e e defeated. I have, from my youth, been familiar with toils,
and with dangers. I was faithful to your interest, my countrymen, when- I served you for no rewvard, but that of honour. It is not my design to betray you, now that you
have confered upon me a place of profit. You have corimmitted to my condua thle war against Jugurtha. The Patricians are offended at this. But where would be the wisdom
of giving such a commuand to one of their honourable body,
a person of illustrious birtl-, of ancient family of innumerable statues, but-,of no experience? What service wouldChap. Ill. ORATIONS AND' HARANGUES. o05
his long line of dead ancestors, or his multitude of motionless statues, do his country in thi day of battle? What
could such a general do, but, in his trepidationl and inexperience, have recourse to- some inferior coramander,
for dire&amp;tion in difficulties, to which he was not himself
equal! Thus, your Patrician. general would, in fa~ts have
a general over him; so that the aaing commander would
still be a Plebeian. So true is this, my countrymen, that I
have myself known those, yiho have been chosen consuls,
begin then to read the history of their own country, of
which till that tirme they were totally ignorant; that is,
they first obtainedll the employment, and then bethought
themselves of the qualifications necessary for the proper discharge of it. I suibmit to your judgment, Romans, on
which side the advantage lies, when acomrparisonis made
between Patrician haughtiness, and Plebeian experience,
The very actions which they have only read, I have partly
seen, and partly myself atchieved. What they know by
reading, I kno-w by aEtion. They are pleased to slight my
mean birth: I despise their mean characters. Want of
birth andfortune is the objeCion against me: want of personal worth against them. But are not all men of the same
species; What can nmake a difference. between one man
and another, but the endowments of the mind? For my
part, I shall always look upon the bravest man as the noblest mnan. Suppose it were enquired of the fathers of such
Patricians as Albinus and Bestia, whether, if they had their
choicec- they would desire sons of theirt charaCter, or of mine;
what wrould they answer; but that they should. wish the worthies to be their sons? If the Patricians have reason to
c!espise me,.let them likewise despise their ancestors, whose
nobility w;as the fruit of their virtue. Do they envy- the h-Q
nours bistowed upon mne? Let them envy likewise my labours, -my abstinence, and the dangers I have undergone
for my country; by which I have acquired them. B:ut those
worthless men lead such a life of inatlivity, as if they despised any honours you can bestow; whilst they aspire to hionours, as if they had deserved them by the most industrious
-virtue. ---They arrvogate the rewards of aaivity for their having enjoyed the pleasures of luxury. Yet none can be more
lavish than they are, in praise of their ancestors. And they
imagine they honour themselves by celebrating their forefathers, W\hereas they do the very contrary. For, as much
as their ancestors were distinguished for their virtues, so106 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. BooA K
much are they disgraced by their vices. The glory of ancestors cast a li;ht, indeed, upon their posterity: but it
only serves to shlow -what the descendants are. It alike exhibits to public view their degeneracy and their worth. I
own, I cannot boast of the deeds of my forefathers: but I
hope I may answer the cavils of the Patricians, by standing
up in defence of what I have myself done. Observe, now,
my countrymen, the injustice of the Patricians. They arrogate to themnselves honours on account of the exploits done
by their forefathers, whilst they will not allow me the diue
praise for performing t'he very same sort of aations in my own
person. He has no statues, they cry, of his family. He
can trace no venerable line of ancestors.- What then'Is it
matter of more praise to disgrace one's illustrious ancestors
than to become illustrious by his own good behaviour? What
if I can shew no statues of my family? I can shew the standards, the armour, and the trappings, which I have myself
taken from the vanquished; I can shew the scars of those
wounds, which I have received by facing the enemies of my
country. These are my statues. These are the honours I
boast of-; not left me by inheritance, as theirs; but earned
by toil, by abstinence, by valour, amidst clouds of dust, and
s'eas of blood; scenes of aftion, where those effeminate Patricians, who endeavour, by indirect means, to depreciate

CALISTIIHENES's REPROOF OF CLEON's FLATTERY TO ALEXANDER.
JF the king were present, Cleon, there would be no need
of my answering to what you have just proposed. He
would himself reprove you for endeavouring to draw him
into an imitation of foreign absurdities, and for bringing envy upon him by such unmanly flattery. As he is absent,
I take upon me to tell you in his name, that no praise is
lasting, but what is rational; and that you do what you can
to lessen his glory, instead of adding to it. Heroes have
never, among us, been deified, till after their death. And
whatever may be your way of thinking, Cleon, for my part,
I wish the king may not, for many years to come, obtain that
honour. You have mentioned, as precedents of what you
propose, Hercules and Bacchus. Do you imagine, CleounChap. IV. ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. 107
that they were deified over a cupi of wine? And are you and
I qualified to make gods? Is the king, otur sovereigln, to receive his divinity from you and me, who are his subjeds?
First try your power, whether you can make a king. It is,
surely, easier-to make a king, than a god: to give an earthly
dominion, than a throne in heaven. I only wish, that the
gods may have heard, without offence, the arrogant proposal
you have made, of adding one to their number; and that they
may still he so propitious to us, as to grant the continuance
of that success to our affairs, with which they have hitherto
favoured us. For my part, I am not ashamed of my country; nor do I approve of our adopting the rites of foreign nations, or learning from them how we ought to reverence our
kings. To, receive laws, or rules of conduti from them,
what is it, but to confess ourselves inferior to them?.2tintus Currtius.

That you may understand the genius of the Scythians, we
present you with a yoke of oxen, an arrow, and a goblet.
WVe use these repeatively in our commerce with friends, and
with foes. We give to our friends the corn, which we raise
by the labour of our oxen.'With the goblet we join with
them in pouring drink-offerings to the gods; and with arrows we attack our enemiies. We have conquered those,
wvho have attempted to tyrannize over us in our own country, and likewise the kings of the Medes and Persians, whlen
they made unjust war upon us; and we have opened to ourselves a way into Egypt. You pretend to be the punisher of
robbers; end are yourself the geleral robber of mankind.
You have taken Lydia: you have seized Syria: yout are master of Persia: you have subduied the Batarians; and attacked India. All this wilvl not satisfy you, unless you lay your

furnished only wi-th hands,'to distribute her capricious favours, and with fins, to elude the grasp of those, to whom
she lhas been bountiful. You give yourself out to be a god,
the son ofJupiter Hammon. It suits the charaa-er of a god,
to bestow favours on mortals; not to deprive them of what
they have. But if you are no god, refle~t on the precarious condition of humnanity. You will thus shew more wisdom, than by dwelliing on those subjei-ts which have puffed
up your pride, and made you forget youtrself. You see how'
little you are likely to gain by attempting the con-quest of
Scythia. On the other hand, you may, if you please, have
in us a valuable alliance. ~We command the borders of both
Europe and Asia. There is nothing between us and Bactria, but the river Tanais: and our territory extends to
Thrace, which, as we have heard, borders on Macedon--
If you decline attacking us in a hostile manner, you may
have our friendship. Nations which have never been at war
are on an equal footing. But it is in vain, that confidence is
reposed in a conquered people. There canbe no sincere
friendship between thle oppressor and the oppressed. Even
in peace, the latter think themselves entitled to the rights
of war against the former. We will, if you think good,
enter into a treaty with you, accorlin,- to our manner,
which is, not by signing, sealing, and taking the giods to
witness, as is the Grecian custom; but by doing acdual services. TIhe Scythians are not used to promlise; but to performn without promising.  And they think an appeal to the
gods superfluous; for that those, who have no rogard for the
esteem of men, will not hesitate to offend the gods, by perjuIry. You mnay therefore consider witlh yourself, whethe;r

on that our united efforts on the present day wvill prove the
beginning of universal liberty to Britain. For none of us
are hitherto debased by slavery; and we have no prospe6e of
a secure retreat behind us, eitl-ier by land or sea, whilst the
Roman fleet hovers around. Thus the use of arms, which
is at all times honourable to the brave, here offers the only
safety even to cowards. In all the battles which have yet
been fought with various success against the Romans, the
resources of hope and aid were in our hands; for we, the
noblest inhabitants of Britain, and therefore stationed in its
deepest recesses, far from the view of servile shores) have
preserved even our eyes unpolltuted by the contrait of subjeCtion. WVe, at the farthest limits both of land and liberty,
have been defended to this day by the obscuirity of our situation and of our.fame.'The extremity of Britain is now
disclosed; and whatever is unknown becomnes an objeCt of
importance. But there is no nation beyond us; nothing but
waves and rocks; and the ilomans are before us. The arrogance of these invaders it will be in vain to encounter
by obsequiousness and submission. The plunderers of the
world, after exhausting the land by their devastations, are
rifling the ocean: stimulated by avarice, if their enemy be
rich; by ambition, if poor: unsatiated by the East and by
the West: the only people who behold wealth and indigence
with equal avidity. To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire: and when they make a desert they call it peace.
Ouv children and relations are by the appiointment of nature rendered the dearest of all things to us. These are
torn away by levies to foreign servitude... Our. wives and
tisters: though they should escape the violation of hostile
force, are polluted under the names of icrlndship and hospitality. Our estates and possessions are consumtied in tributes;
our grain in contributions. Even the powers of our bodies
are worn down amidst stripes and insults in clearing woods
and draininSg marshes. tWretcles born to blavery are first
bought, and afterwards fed by their masters: Britain continually buys, continually feeds her own servitude., And
as among domnestic slaves every new-comer serves for the
scorin and derision of his fellows; so, in this ancient household of the world, we, as thle last and vilest, are soujght out
for destruCtion. For we have neither cultivated lands nor
mines, nor harbours, which can induce them to preserve us
for our labours; and our Valour and unsubmitting spirit willrChap. Y  ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. ljIt
only render us more obnoxious to our-imperious masters;
while the verv remoteness and secrecGy of our situation, ili
proportion as it conduces to security, will tend to inspire
suspicion. Since then all hopes of forgiveness are vain, let
those at length assume courage, to whom- glory, to whorn
safety is dear. The Brigantines, even undler a female leader,
had force enough to burn thie enemy's settlements, to storm
their camps; and, if success had not introduced negligence
and ina6livity, would have been able entirely to throw off
the yoke: and shall not we, untouched, unsubdued, and
struggling not for the acquisition, but the continuance of
liberty, declare at the very first onset what kind of men Caledonia has reserved for her defence?
CAN you imagine that the Romans are as brave in war
as they are insolent in peace? Acquiring renown from our
discords and dissentions, thev convert the errors of their enemies to the glory of their own army; an army compounded&amp;of the most different nations, which as success alone has
kept together, misfortune will certainly dissipate. Unless,
indeed, you can suppose that Gauls, and Germans, and (t
blush to say it) even Britons, lavishing their blood for a foreign state, to which they have been longer foes than subjets, will be retained by loyalty and affeaion! Terror and
dread alone, weak bonds of attachment, are the ties by
which they are restrained; and when these are once broken,
those who cease to fear begin to hate. Every incitement to
vi&amp;tory is on our side. The Romans have no wives to animate them;.no parents to upbraid their flight. Most of them
have either no liabitation, or a distant one. Few in number, ignorant of the coulntry, looking around in silent hlorror at the woods, seas, and a heaven itself unknown to them,
they are delivered by the gods, as it were iilAprisoned and
bound, into our hands. Be not terrified with an idle shew,
and the glitter of silver and gold, which can neither prote6t
nor wound. In the very ranks of the enemy we- shall find
our'own bands. The Britons will acknowledge their own
cause. The Gauls will recolle&amp;l their former liberty. The
Germanis will desert them, as the Usipii have lately done.
Nor is there any thing formidable behind them: Ungarrisoned forts; c-lonies of invalids; municipal towns distempered and distra&amp;.ed between unjust masters, and ill-obeying
subjects. Here is your general; here your army. There,

reign so grievous to the people, so offensive to the nobles,
as the first days of her's? When she was driven out, did Stephen corre6t his former bad condu&amp;? Did he dismiss his
odious foreign favourite? Did he discharge his lawless foreign hirelings, who had been so long the scourge and the
reproach of England? Have they not lived ever since upon
free quarter, by plundering our houses and burning our
cities? And noow, to complete our miseries, a new army of
foreigners, Angevins, Gascons, Poi&amp;cevins, I know not
who are come over with Henry Plantagenet, tile son of
Matilda: and many more, no doubt, will be called to assist
himn, as soon as ever his affairs abroad- will permit; by whose
lhetlp if he be vi&amp;orious, England must pay the price of
their services: our lands, our honouirs must be the hire of
these rapacious invaders. But suppose we should have the
fortulne to conquer for Stephen, what will be the consequence?
Will viaory teach him moderation? Will he learn from security that re-ard to our liberties; which he could not learn
from danger? Alas! the only fruit of our good success
will be tlhis; the estates of the earl of Leicester and others
of our countrymen, who have now quitted the party of the
king, will be forfeited; and new confiscations will accrue
to WVilliam of Ipres.
BUT let us not hope, that, be our vi&amp;t-ory ever so complete,
it will give any lasting peace to this kingdom. Should
I-Ienry fall in this battle, there are two other brothers to
sutcceed to his claim, and support his faaion, perhaps with
less merit, but certainly with as much ambition as he. What
shall we do then to free ourselves from all these misfortunes?
-Let us prefer the interest of our country to that of our par,

of calamity, awd our most happy vi&amp;bries deserve to be celebrated only by tears. Nature herself is dismayed, and
shrinks back from a combat, where every blow that we strike
may murder a friend, a relation, a parent. Let us hearken

all, if we save the' lives of thousands of Englislhmen, that
pJust otherwise fall in this battle, anti in many other battles,
which, hereafter, may be fought on this quarrel.? It is in
*ur power to do so-It is in our power to end the controver.
sy, both safely and hoi-ourably; by an amicable agreement;
not by the sword. Stephen may enjoy the royal dignity to
his life, and the succession may be secured to the yoiung_ duke
of Normandy) with such a present rank in the state, as befits
the heir of -the crown. Even the-bitterest enemies of the king
must acknowledge, that he is valiant, generous, and good4
natured; his warmest friends cannot deny, that'he has a
great deal of rashness and indiscretion. Both may therefore
conclude, that he should not be deprived of the royal authoT~ity, but that he ought to be restrained fromn a futrther abuse
ef it; whi-ch cant be done by no means, so certain and effectual, as what I propose; for thus his power will be te-rmper=
ed by the presence, the counsels, &amp; influence of Prince Hteinry; who from his own interest in the wealth of the kingdom.vhich he is to inherit, will always have a right to interpose
his advice, and even his authority, if it be necessary, against
any future violation of our liberties; andl to procure an effeEtual redress of our grie&amp;vances, which we have hitherlto
sought in vain. If all the English in both armies unite, as
I hope they may, in this plan of pacification,,they will,
be able to give the law to the foreigners, and oblige both
the king and the duke to consent to it. This will secure
the public tranqiuility, and leave no secret stings of resentmnent, to rankle in the hearts of a suffering party, and produce futiure disturbances,  As there will be iio tritnimph,

MR. PULTENEY's SPEECH ON THE MOTION FOR
REDUCING THE ARMY.
E have heard a great deal about parliament armies,
and about an a-rmy continued from year to year; I[116   ORATIONS AND          HARANGUES.           Book V.
have always been, Sir, and always shall be, against a standing army of any kind -: to me it is a terrible thing, whether
unlder that of parliamentary or any other designation; a
standing army is -still a standing army, whatever name it be
called by; they are a bcdy of men distinct from the body of
the people; they are governed by different laws, and blind
obedience', and an entire submission to the orders of their
commanding officer is their only principle. The nations
around us, Sir, are already enslaved, and have been enslaved
by those very means; by means of their standing armies
tlbiy have every one lost their liberties; it is indeed impos.
sible that the liberties-of the people can be preserved in any
country where a numeirous standing army is kept up. Shall
we then take any of our measures froomn the examples of our
neighbours? No, Sir, on the contrary, from their misfortunes we ouglt to learn to avoid those rocks upon which
they have split.
IT signifies nothing to tell me, that our army is commanded by such gentlemen as can-not be supposed to join in any
measures for enslaving their counltry; it may be so; I hope
it is so; I have a very go6d opinion of many gentlemen
now in the army; I believe they would not join in any such
measures; but their lives are uncertain, nor can wve be sure
how long thl-ey ma7 be sontinued in command; they may
be all dismissed in a moment, and proper tools of power put
in.their room. Besides, Sir, we know the passions of men,
we know how dangerous it is to tritst the best of men with
too much power. Where was there a braver army than that
under Julius Cesari Wbhere wvas thlere ever an army that
bad served their country more faithfully? That army was
commanded generaily by the best citizens of Rome, by men
of great fortune and figure in their country; yet that army
enslaved their country. The affe6tions of the soldiers towards their country, the honour and integrity of the under
officers, are not to be depended on; by the military law)
the administration of justice is so quick, and the punishments
so severe, that neither officer nor soldier dares offer to dispute the orders of his supreme commander; he must not
consult his own inclinations: if an officer were commanded
to pull his own father out of this house, he must do it; he
dares not disobey; immediate death would be the sure consequence of the least grumbling. Ancl if an officer were sent
into'the court of requests, accompanied by.a body of mus-keteers with screwed bayonelts and with orders to tell u.sChap. fIIL ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. i1
what we ought to do, and how we were to vote, I know
what would be the duty of this house; I know it would be
our duty to order the officer- to be taken and hanged up' at
the door of the lobby: but, Sir, I doubt nmuch if such a spirit could be found in the house, or in any house of Coinmons that will ever be irn England.
Sia, I talk not of imaginary things; I talk of what has
happened to an English house of Commons, and from an
English army; not only from an English army, but an army that was raised by that vtery house of Commons, an army that was paid by them, and an army that was comrnianded
by generals appointed by them. Therefore do not let us
vainly imagine, that an army raised ancl maintained by authority of Parliament, will always be submissive to them:
if an army be so numerous as to.have it in their power to
over-awe the Parliament, they will be submissive as loig as
the Parliament does nothing to disoblige- their avourite general; but when that case happens, I a;nl airaid that in place
of the Parliament's dismissing the army, the army will dismiss the Parliament, as they hav-e donwe wheietoiorc. Nor
does the' legality or illegality of that Parli ament, or of that
army, alter the case; for with respeiA to that army, -andaccording to their way of thinking, tha.t Parliament dismissed
by them was a legal Parliament; they were an arly raised
and maintained according to law, and at first they were
raised, as they imagined, for the preservation of those liberties which they afterwards destroyed.
IT has been urged, Sir,&gt; that whoever is for the Protestant
succession nmust be for continuing the army: for that very

SIR JO;HN ST. AUEIN'S SPEECH FOR REPEALING
THE tSEPTENNIAL ACT.
fR., S PEvAKER,
liE subject matter of this debate is of such importance,
T  that I should be ashamed to return to my electors, without endeavouring, in the best manner I am able, to declare
publicly the reasons 7which induced me to give my most
ready assent to this question.
TuaE  people have an unquestionable right'to frequentnew Parliaments by ancient usage; and this usage has been
confirmed by several laws, which have been progressively
made by our ancestors, as often as they found' it necessary
to-insist on this essential privilege.
PARLIAM1'NTS were generally annual, but never continued longer than three years, till the remarkable reign of
Henry VIII. He, sir, was a prince of unruly appetites,
and of an arbitrary will; lie was impatient of every reChap. IX.'ORATIONS AND        HARANGUES. 119
straint; the laws of God and man fell equally a sacrifice,
as they stood in the way of his avarice, or disappointed his
ambition: he therefore introcluced lorng Parliaments, because he very well knew, that they would become the pro.
per instruments of both; and what a slavish obedience they
paid to all his measures is sufficiently known.
IF we come to the reign of King Charles the First, we
must acknowledge him to be a prince of a contrary temper;
he had certainly an innate love for religion and-virtue.
But here lay the misfortune --he was led from his. natural disposition by sycophants and flatterers; they advised him
to neglect the calling of frequent new parliaments, and therefore by not taking the constant sense of his people in what
he did, he was worked up into so hig-h a notion of prerogative, that the Conmmons (in order to restrain it) obtained that
independent fatal power, which at, last unhappily brought
him to his most tragical end, and at the same timne subverted
the whole constitutionl. And I hiope we shall learn this lesson
from it, never to compliment the crown with any new or
extravagant powers, nor to deny the people those. rights,
which by ancient usage they are entitled to; but to preserve
the just and equal balance, from which they will both derive
mutual security and which if duly observed, will render
our constitution the envy and admi-ration of all the world.
KING CaARLES- the Second naturallv took a surfeit of
Parliaments in his father's time, and was therefore extremely
desirous to lay them aside. -But this wai a scheme impraacicable. However, in effe6i, he did so: for he obtained a
parliament, which, by its long duration, like an army of
veterans, became so exa2tly disciplined to his owvn measures, that they knew no other command but from that person who gave them their pay.
TH-I-S was a safe and most ingenious way of ensla"vingi a
nation. It was very well known, that arbitrary power,e if
it was open ancl avowed, would never prevail here. The
people were therefore amused with the speciouc- forin of
their ancient constittution: it existed, indeed., in their fancy;
but, like a mere phantom, had no substance nor reality in it;
for the power, the authority, the dignity of ParliaTnents
were wholly lost. This was that remarkable Parliament
which so justly obtained the opprobrious namne of the PENSION PARLIAMNIF.T; and was the model from which, I believe, some latter Parliaments have been exaaiy copied.
AT the time of the revolution) the people mladu a fresh120 ORATIONS AND HIARANGUES. Book VY
claim of their ancient privileges; and as they had so lately
experienced the misfortune of long and servile Parliaments,
it was then declared, that they should be held frequently.
But, it seems, their full meaning was not understood by this
declaration; and therefore, as in every new settlement the
intention of all parties should be specifically manifested, the
Parliament never ceased struggling witli the crown, till the
triennial law was obtained; the preamble of it is extremely full and strong; and in the bocly of the bill yo,i will find
the word declared before enacted, by which I apprehend, that
though this law did not immediately take place at the time
of the revolution, it was certainly intended as declaratory of
their first meaninig, and therefore stands a part of that original contraa under which the constitution was then settled.
His Majesty's title to the crown is primarily derived from
that contra&amp;; and if, upon a review) there shall appear to
be any dev-iations from it, we ougliht to treat them  as so
many injuries done to that title. And I dare say, that
this h-,ouse, which has gone through so long a series of services to his Majesty, will at last be willing to revert to those
original stated measures of government, to renew  and
strengthen th-at title.
BUT, Sir, I think the manner in which the septennial law
was first introduced, is a very strong reason why it should
be repealed. People, in their fears, have very often recourse to desperate expedients, which, if not cancelled in
season, will thlem selves prove fatal to that constitution, which
they were meant to secure. Such is the nature of the septennial law; it was intended only as a preservative against
a temporary inconvenience: the inconvenience is removed,
but the mischievous effe&amp;s still continue.; for it not only
altered tihe constitution of Parliaments, but it extenlded that
same Parliament beyond its natural duration; and therefore
carries this most unlJust implication. withl it, T'lhat you may
at any time usurp the most indubitab!e, the most essential
privilege of the people,----I mean that of ch!using' their
own representatives. A precedent of such a dangerous consequence, of so fatalla tencdency, that I think it would be a
reproach to our statute-book if that law was any longer to
subsist, which might reco-rd it to posterity.
THIs is a'season of virtue and public spirit. Let us take
advantage of it to repeal those laws which infringe our lii
berties, and introduce such as may restore the vigour of our
ancient constitution.Chap. IX. ORATIONS AND HARA NGIUES. 121
HUMAN, nature is so very corrupt, that all obligations
lose their force, unless they are frequently renewed.Long Parliaments become therefore independent of the
people, and when they do so, there always happens a most
dangerous dependence elsewhere.
LONG Parliaments give the minister an opportunity of getting acquaintance with members, of practising his several
arts to win them into his schemes -----This must be the
work of time. C--Corruption is of so base a nature, that
at first sight it is extremely shocking.-- Hardly any one
has submitted to it all at once,--- His disposition must be
previously understood, the particular bait must be found out
with which he is to be allured, and after all, it is not without many struggles that he surrenders his virtue.--Indeed, there are some, who will at once plunge themselves
into any base aetion, but the. generality of mankind are of
a more cautious nature, and will proceed only by leisurely
degrees,-   One or two perhaps have deserted their colours the first campaign, some have done it a second.---
But a great many, who have not that eager disposition to
vice, will wait till a third.
FOR this reason, short Parliaments have been less corrupt
than long ones; they are observed, like streams of water,
always to grow more imipure the greater distance- they run
from the fountain-head.
I AM: aware, it may be said, that frequent new Parliamnents will produce frequent new expences, but I think quite
tle contrary,; I am really of opinion, that it will be a proper remedy against the evil of bribery at ele&amp;ions, especially as you have provided so wholesome a law to co-opeflate
upon these occasions.
BRIBrERy at elea;ions, whence c?I.t it arise? Not from.o
country gentlemen, for they mre sure of being chosen without it;--it was, Sir) the inventiont of wicked and corrupt
ministers, who have, fromn tinme to time, led weak Princes
into such destru.tive measures, that they clid not dare to rely upon the natural representation of the people.-  Long
Parliamenrts, Sir, first introduced bribery, because they were
worth purchasing at any rate:-Country gentlemen, who
bave only their private fortuaes to rely upon, anld have no
xmercenary ends to seuve, are unable to oppose it, especiall3y
if at any time the public treasure shall be unfaithflilly squandered away to corrupt their boroughs.--Country gentlemen) indeed, may make some weak eforts i but as they,

f~ults, and all others of the same natuire, must be correL;ed in the pronunciation of a geldenmal who is suppo-sed to
have seen too much of the world, to retain the peculiarities of the distriat in which he was born.
RULE V.
Pronounce every word consisting of mnore than one syllable
with its proper accent.
T HERE is a necessity for this dire6ion, because many speakers have affeaed an.unusual and pedantic
mode of accenting words, laying it down as a rule, that
the accent should be cast as far backwards as possible; a
rule which has no foundation in the construaion of the
English language, or in the laws of harmony. In accenting words, the general custom and a good ear are the best
guides: only it may be observed that accent should be regulated, not by any arbitrary rules of quantity, but by the
number and nature of the simple sounds.
R U L E      VI.
Ini every sentence distinguish the more significant words by
a natural, forcible, and varied emphasis.
EMPHASIS points out the precise meaning of a sen.
tence, shews in what manner one idea is conne&amp;led
with, and rises out of another, marks the several clauses
of a sentence, gives to every part its proper sound, and
thus conveys to the mind of the reader the full import of
the whole. It is in the power of emphasis to make long
and complex sentences appear intelligible and perspicuous. But for this purpose it is necessary, that the reader
shouldte perfedly acquainted with the exa&amp; constru&amp;tion
and full meaning of every sentence which he recites.
Without this it is imnpossible to give those infle6tions and
variations to the voice, which nature requires: and it is

generally prove unsuccessftul, and the time of a fresh struggle is at so great a distance, they at last grow faint in the
dispute, give up their country for lost, and retire in despair.--
Despair naturally produces indolence, and that is the proper disposition for slavery. Ministers of state undeistgnnd
this very well, and are therefore unwilling to awaken the nation out of its lethargy, by frequent elefions.---They know
that the spirit of liberty, like every other virtue of the mind,
is to be kept alive only by constant a6tion; that it is impossible to enslave this nation, whilst it is perpetually upon its
guard.   Let country gentlemen then, by ihaving frequent
opportunities of exerting themselves, be kept warm and active in their contention for the public good: this will raise
that zeal and spirit, which will at last get the better of those
undue influences, by which the officers of the crown, though
unknown to the several boroug-hs, have beenl able to supplant countiy gentlemeni of great characters and fortune,
who live in their neighbourhood.-I do not say this upon
idle speculation only.--I live in a country where it is too
wvell known, and I appeal to many gentlernen in the house,
to more out of it (and who are so for this very reason,) for
the truth of my assertion. Sir,1 it is a sore which has been
long eating, into the most vital part of our constitutioh, and
I hope the time will come when yout will probe it to the bottom--For if a minister should ever gain a corrupt familiarity with our boroughs, if he should keep a register of'theni in his closet, and, by sending down his tresury-mandates, should procure a spurious representative of the people, the offspring of his corruption, who will be at all tinmes
ready to reconcile and justify the most contradictory measures of his administration, and even to vote every crude
indigested dreani of their patron into a law; if the maintenanice of his power should become the sole obVje  of their attention, and they shall be guilty of the imost violent breach
of Parliamentary trust, by giving the King a discretionary
liberty of taxing the people without limitation or controul;
the last fatal compliment they can pay to the crown:--i
this should ever be the unhappy condition of this nation, the
people indeed may complain; but the doors of that place
vwhere their complaints slhould be heard will for ever be slhut
against them.

into a natural condition of working out her own cure.
SIR, upon the whole, I am o of pinion, that I cannot express a greater zeal for his Majesty, for thle liberties of the
people, or tlhe honour and dignity of this house, than by

CHAP. X.
SIR ROBERT WALPOLE's REPLY.
M-R. CHANC:ELzLOR OF 9"HE E XCHEEOQUER,
TH-IOUGH the question has been already so fully opposed, that there is no great occasion to sayan y thing
farther against it, yet I hope, the house will indulge me
the liberty of giving some of those reasons, which induce mne
to be against the motion. In general I must take notice,
that the nature of our constitution seems to- be very much
mistaken by the gentlemen who have spoken in favour of this
motion. It is certain, that ours is a mixt government, and
the perfeaion of our constitution consists in this, that the
monarchical, aristocratical, &amp; democrlatical forms of govern-nent, are mixt and interwoven in ours, so as to give us all
the advantages of.each, without subjeating us to the dangers
and inconveniencies of either. The democratical form of government, which is the only one I have now occasion to take
notice of, is liable to these inconveniencies. That they are
generally too tedious in their coming- to any resoiution, are
seldom brisk and expeditions enough in carrying their resolutions into execution: that they are always wavering in their
resolutions, and never steady in any of the measures they
resolve to pursue; and that they are often involved in factions, seditions and insurreCioDns, which exposes them to be
rnade the tools, if not the prey of their neighbours: therefore in all the regulations we make, with respet to our constitution, we are to guard against. running too much into that
form of governmen t which is properly called democratical:
this was, in iiv opinion, the effe&amp;t of the trieninial law, and
will again be the efTeA1, if even it should be restored.
THAT triennial eleaions would make our goverment too
tedious in all their resolves, is evident; because, in such
case, no prudent adminisitration would ever resolve upon any124 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. Book PC
ineasure of consequence, till they' had felt not only the pulse
of thle parliamentl but the pullse of the people; and the mifisters of state would always labour under this disadvantaegc,
~that as secrets of state must not be immediately divulged,
their enemies, (and enemies they will always hlave) would'ave a handle for exposing their measures, and rendering
them disagreeable to the people, and thereby carrying perIaaps a new ele&amp;aion against them, beft.re they could have
an opportun4ty of justifying their measures, by divulging
those faas and circumstances, froml whtence the justice antd
the wisdom of their measures would clearly appear.
THEN, Sir, it is by experielce well knotwn, that what is
Called the populace of every country, tre apt to be too much
elated with success, and too much de'e&amp;ed with every misfortune? this makes them wavering in their opinions about
affairs of state, and never long of the same mind;- and asthis
house is chosen by the free and unbiassecd voice of the people
in general, if this clihoice were so often renewed, we might
expe&amp;t, tlhat this house would be as waverin1g, and as unsteady as the people usually are; and it being impossible to
carry on the public affairs of the nation, without the concAiri:ence of this house, the ministers would always be obliged
to comply, and consequently, would be obliged to change
their measures, as often as the people changed their minds.'VITII septennial Parliaments, Sir, we are not exposed to
either of these imisfortunes, becauise, if the ministeers, after
having felt the pulse of the parliament, which. they can always soon do, resolve upon any measures, they. have generally time enough before the new eledions come on, to give
the people proper information, in order to show them  the
justice and the wisdom of the measures they have pursued;
and if the people should at any time be too much elated,
or too much deje6ted, or should without a cause clhanlge
their minds, those at the helm of affairs have time to set
them right-before a new elecion comes on.
As to faetion and sedition, Sir, I will grant, that in moo
narchical and aristocratical governments, it generally arises
from violence and oppression; but in democratical governments, it always arises from tthe people's having too great a
share in the government; for in all countries, and in all governments, there always will be many' faaious and unquiet
spirits, who can npver be at rest either in power or out of
power; when in power, they are never easy, unless every
man submits intirely to their direaion; antd when out ofChap. X. ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. 125
power, they are always working and intriguing against those
that are in, without any regard to justice, or to the interest
of their country: in popular governments such men have too
much game, they have too many opportunities for working
upon and corrupting the minds of the people, in order to
give them a, bad impression of, and to raise discontents
against, those that have the management of the public affairs
for the time; and these discontents often break out into seditions and insurrections. This, Sir, would in my opinion
be our misfortune, if our Parliaments were either annual or
triennial: by such frequent eleEtions, there would be so much
power thrown into the lhands of the people, as would destroy
that equal miixture, which is the beauty of our constitution  
in short, our government would really become a democratical government, and might from thence very probably diverge into a tyrannical: Therefore, in order to preserve
oU_' constitution, in order to prevent outr falling under tyranny. and arbitrary power, we ou;ght to preserve that law,
whlictl I really think has birought our constitution to a more
equ,al mixture, and consequently to greater perfeation than
it was ever in before that law took place.
As to bribery and corruption, Sir if it were possible to influence, by such base means, the majority of the eleaors of
Great-Bi itain, to chuse such men as would probably give up
their liberties; if it were possible to influence bIy such
means, a maijority of the members of this house, to consent to
the establishment of arbitrary powxer, I would readily allow,
that the calculations made by the gentlemen of the other side
w_ere just, and their' inference true  b'.t I am persuaded
tha/t neither of these is possible. As the members of this
house generally are, and must always be gentlemen of fortule andc figure in their cotntry; is it possible to suppose,
that any of them could, by a pension, or a post, be influenced to consent to the overthrow of ourt' constittion; by which
the enjoyment, not only of what he got, buCof what he before had, would be rendered altogether precarious? I'will
allow, Sir, that with respeCt to bribery, the price must be
higher or lower, generally in proportion to the virtue of the
man who is to be bribed; but it mlust likewise be granted,
that the humour he happenr to be in at' the timne, the spirit
he happens to be endowed with, adds a grt'eat detdl to his virtue. When no encroLtch!nuats are madie uf)on the rights of
the people, when the people do not think themselves in any
danger, there may be many of the eleeors, who by a bribe126   ORATIONS AND IHARANGUES               S.   Book V.
of ten guineas, might be induced to vote for one candicdate
rather than another; but if the court were making any encroachments upon the rights of the people, a proper spirit
would, without doubt, arise in the nation; and in sucli a
case, I am persuaded, that none, or very few, even of such
eleators, could be induced to vote for a court candidate; no,
"not for ten timnes the suni.
THaRE may, Sir, be some bribery and corruption in the
nation; I am afraid there will always be some; but it is no
proof of it, that strangers are sometimes chosen; for a gentleman may have so much natural infltuence over a borough
in his neighbourhood as to be able to prevail with them to
chuse any person he pleases to recommend; and if upon
such recommendation they chuse one or two of his friends,
wlho are perhaps strangers to them; it is not fromn thence
to be inferred, that the two strangers were chosen their representatives by the imeans of bribery and corrlption.
To insinuate, Sir, that money may be issued firom the
piubljG treasury for bribing ele&amp;ions, is really something,
-very extraordinary, especially in those gentlemen liho know
how many checks are upon every shilling that can be issued
from thence; and how regularly the money granted in ohe
year for the public service of the nation, must always be
accounted ior, the very next session, in this house, and
likewise in the other, if they have a mind to call for atly
such account. And as to the gentlemen in office, if they
ha,ve any advantage over country gentlemen, in having something else to depend on besides their own private' fortunes,
tihey have likewise many disadvantages: they are obliged to
live at London with their families, by which they are put to
a much greater expence, than gentlemen of equal fortuines,
who live in the country: this lays them under a very great
disadvantage, with respea to the supporting their interest
tin the country. The country gentlemen, by living among
the ele6tors, and purchasing the necessaries for his family
from'them, keeps up an acquaintance and correspondence
with them, without putting himself to any extraordinary
charge; whereas a gentleman who lives in London, has no
other way of keeping up an acquaintance or correspondence
among his friends in the country, but by going down once
or twice a year at a very, extraordinary charge, and often,
without any other business; so that we may concllde, a gentlemain in office cannot, even in seven years, save much fol
distributing in ready money, at the time of an eledlion; and
I veally belieYe, if the iata w.re narrowly incNuird,4 iltijc. JtChaip. XI.  ORATIONS AND         HARANGU-ES. 127would appear, that the gentlemen in office are as little guilty
of:bribing their eletlors with ready money- as any other set
of gentlemen in the kingdom.
THAT there are ferments often raising amon'g the people
withotit any just cause, is what I am surprised to hear controverted, since very late experience imay convince us of the
contrary. Do not we know what a ferment was raised in the
nation, towards,the latter end of the latLe Queen's reign?
And it is well known, what a fatal change in the affairs
of this nation was, introduced, or at least confiemed, by an
eleation's coming on while the nation was in that ferlmeit.
Do not we know what a ferment was raised in the nation,
soon after his late Majesty's accession? And if an eleaion
had then been allowed to come on, while the nation was in
that ferment, it n-igilt perhaps have had as fatal effe&amp;s as
the former; but, thank GCod, this was wisely ptrovided against
by' the very law which is now wanted to be repealed.
As such ferments may lhereafter often happen, I must
think that frequenlt eleations will always be dangerous; for
which reason, as far as I can see at present, I shall, I beiieve, at all times, think it a very dangerous experiment to
repeal-the septennial bill.
CHAP. XI.
LORD LYTTELTON's SPEECH ON THE                REPEALOF THE ACT CALLED THE JEWv BILL, IN THE
YEAR 1753.
MjlIR. 3'PEAKER,
SEE no occasion to enter at present into the merits of the
bill we past the last session for the naturalization of Jews;
becatuse I am convinced, that in the present temper of the
niation, not a single foreign Jew will think it expedient to
take ally Dbenefit of that adt; and therefore, the repealing of
it is giving tip nothing. I assented to it last year in hopes it
might induce some -wealthy Jews to come and settle among
us; in that light I saw enough of utility in it, to make me
incline' rather to approve than dislike it; but, that any man
alive could be zealous, either for or against it, I confess I
had no idea. WVhat affe&amp;s'our religion, is.indeed of the
highest and most serious imnportance. God forbid we should
be ever indifferent about thlat' but, I thought this had no
sore to do with religionl than any, turnpike aat we past in128   ORATIONS AND           HARANRUES.           Book V.
that session; and after all the divinity tl-iat has been preached on the subje,-!  I think so still.
Rl,soLui- loN and steadiness are excellent qualities; but,
it is the application of them upori which their value depends.
A wise government, Mr. Speaker, will know where to yield,
as well as where to resist: and, there is no sturer mark of
littleness of mind in an administration, than obstinacy in
trifles.  Public wisdom on some occasions must condesceind
to give away to popular folly especially in a free country,
where the humour of tlihe people must be considered as at.
tentively, as the humour of a king in an absoltute monarchy.
Under both forlms of gorertnment a pruldent and lhonest ministry will indulg'e a smnall flolly, and will resist a great
one. Not to vouchsafe now andl tiien a kind indulgence
to the former, woulcl discover an ig!norance of hluman nature; not to resist the latter at all tinies, would be meanness and servility.
SIn, I look on the bill we are at present debating, not
as a sacrifice madce to popularity (for it sacrifices nothing)
but as a prudent regarrd to some consequences arising from
the nature of the clamnour raised against the late ac&amp;t for
naturalizing Jews, which seeni to require a particular consideration.
I'r has been hitherto the rare and envied felicity of his
Majesty's reign, that his subjeilts have enjoyed sutich a settled
tranquility, such a fireedomn fi-om angry religious disputes,
as is not to be paralleled in any former times.'-he true
Christian spirit of moderation, of charity, of universal benevolence, has prevailed in th e people, has prevaile d in the
clergy of all ranks and degrees, instead of those narrow principles, those bigoted prejudices, that furious, that implacable, that ignorlant zeal, which had often done so mucll hurt
botlih to the chiurch and the state. But from  the ill-uncerstood, insignificant afe of parliament you are now moved to
repeal, occasion has been taken to deprive us of this inestimable advantage. It is a pretence to (isturb the peace of
the church, to infuse idle fears into the minrls of the people, and make religion itself an engine- of sedition.  It behoves the piety) as well as the visdom of patliament. to
disappoint those endeavors.  Sir, the very worst mischief
that can be dcone to reltgion, is to pervert it to the pt!rposes
of fa6tion. Heaven and Hell are not more distant than the
benevolent spirit of the gospel, a.d? the malignant spirit of
party. The most impious wars ever imade were those calledChap. XL ORATIONS AND HIARANGUES. i29
holy wars. - He, wh-o hates another man for not being a
Christian, is himself not a Christian.  Christianity, Sir,
breathes love, and peace, and good will to all men. A tenper conformable to the didtates of that holy religion has lately distinguished this nation; and a glorious distinaion it
was! But there is latent, at all times, in the mind of the
vulgar, a spark of enthusiasm, which, if blowin by the breath
of a party, may, even when it seems quite extiinguished, be
suddenly- revived and raised to a flamle. The aa of last session for naturalizing Jews, has very unexpe&amp;edly administered fuel to feed that flame. To what a height it may
rise, if it should continue much longer, one cannot easily
tell, but, take away the fuel, and it will die of itself.
IT is the misfortune of all the Roman Catholic countries,
that there the church and the state9 the civil power and the
hierarchy, have separate interests: and are continually at
variance one with the other. It is our happiness, that here
they form but one system. While this hiarm:ony lasts, whatever hurts the chlurch, hurts the state: whatever weakens
the credit of the governors of the church, takes away from
the civil power a part of its strengthy and shakes the whole
constituition.
Sin, I trust and believe, that, by speedily passing this hill,
We shall silence that obloquy; which has so unjustly been cast
upon our reverend prelates (some of the most respeaable
that ever adorned our church) for the part they took in the
ati which this repeals. And it greatly concerns the whole
community, that they should not lose that respeEt, which is
so justly due to them, by a popuiar clamour kept up in opposition to a m.easure of no importance in itself. But if the
departing from that measure should not remove the prejudice so maliciously raised, I am certain that no fiirther step.

to the most mischievous attacks of political disa.ffetion

I think, than that which seclures our persons and estates.

IN  PRAISE OF VIRTUE.
[7W IRTUE is of intrinsic value and goeodl desert, and of
indispensable oblie ation; not the creature of will, but
necessary and immnutable: not local or temporary, but of
equal extent and antiquity with the D)IvINEx MJND; not a
mode of sensation; but everiasting TRUT.TII; not dependent
on power, but the guide of a.ll power. VxIRTUE: is-the fouindation of honlourl and esteemr, and the source of all beauty,
order, and happiness in natXure. It is what confers value on
all the other encldowm ents and qualities of a reasonable'beina, to whicha thly ought to be absolutely subservient, and
without which the more ealinent they are, the more hideous
deformities'ai d the greater curses they become. The use
of it is not confined to any one stage of our existence, or to
any particular situation we can be in, but reaches through
all the periocs and circumrstances of our beings.-Miany of
the endowments and talents we now possess, and of which
we are too apt to be proud, will cease entirely with the present state; but this will be our ornament and dignity in every
future state to which we may be removed. Beauty and wit
will die, learning will vanish away, and all the arts of life
be soon forgot; but virtue will renmain for ever. This unites
us to the whole rational creation, and fits us for conversing
with any order of superior natures, and for a place in any
part of God's works. It procures us the approbation and
love of all wise and good beings, and renders them our allies
and friends.--But what is of unspeakable greater consequence is, that it makes God our friend, assimrilates andChap. XIL. ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. 131
unites our minds to his, and engages his almighty power in
our defence.-Superior beings of all ranks are bound by it
no less than ourselves. It has the same authority in all
worlds that it has in this. The further anly being is advanced in excellence and perfeetion, the greater is his attachment to it, and the rmore is he under its influence.--
To say no more;'Tis tlle LAW of the whole universe; it'
stands first in, the estimation of the Deity; its original is his
nature; and it is the very objea that makes him lovely.
SUCH is the importance of Virtue.--Of what consequence,
therefore, is it that we praaise it?--There is no argument
or motive which is at all fitted to influence a reasonable mind,
which -does not call us to this. One virtuous disposition of
soul is preferable to the greatest natural accomplishments
and abilities, and of more value than all the treasures of the
world.-If you are wise, then, study virtue, and contemn
every thing that can come in competition with it. Remember, that nothing- else deserves one anxious thought or wish.
Remember, that this alone is honour, glory, wealth, and
happiness. Secure this, and you secure every thing. Lose
this, and all is lost.

THE SPEECH OF BRUTUS ON THE DEATH OF
C_ESAR.
OMANS, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
cause; and be silent, that you may hear. Believe me
for mine honour, and have respe&amp;t to mine honour, that you
may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your
senses, that you may the better judge. If there be any in
this assembly, any dear friend of Czsar's, to Ihim I say, that
Brutus's love. to Ce-sar was no less than his. If then th-at
friend demand, why Brutus rose against Casar, this is my
answer: Not that I loved.CTsar less, b.ut that I loved Rome
more. HIad you rather Caesar were living, and die all
slaves; than that C asar were dead, to live all freemen?.s CTsar loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate,
I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honour him;' but as he
was ambitious, I slew him. -'There are tears for his love,
joy for his fortune, honour, for his valour, and death -for his
am-bition. Who's hiere so base) that would be a bond-mnan?XANN ESSAY ON
any other cause, that we so often hear persons read withI
an improper emphasis, or with no emphasis at all, that is,
with a stupid monotony. Much study and pains are necessary in acquiring the habit of just and forcible pronunciation; and it can only be the effe&amp;t of close attention and
long pra&amp;ice, to be able, with a mere glance of the eye,
to read any piece with good emphasis and good discretion.
IT is another office of Emphasis to express the opposition between the several parts of a sentence, where the
style is pointed and antithetical.  Pope's Essay on Man,
and his Moral Essays, and the Proverbs of Solomon, will
furnish many proper exercises in this species of speaking.
In some sentences the antithesis is double, and even treble; these must be expressed in reading, by a very distint6 emphasis on each part of the opposition.  The following instances are of this kind:
ANGIER may glance into the breast of a wise man; but rests only in
the bosom of fools.
AN angry man who suppresses his passion, thinks worse than he
speaks: and an angry man that will chide, speaks worse than he thinks.
BETTER to reign in hell, than serve in heaven.
He rais'd a mortal to the skies;
She brought an angel down.
EMrPHASIS likewise serves to express some particular
meaning not inmmnediately arising from the words, but depending upon the intention of the speaker, or some incidental circumstance.  The following short sentence may
have three different meanings, according to the different
place of the emphasis: Do you intend to go to London this
stuZmmer  
IN order to acquire a habit of speaking with a just and
forcible emphasis, nothing more is necessary, than previously to study the construcion, meaning, and spirit of
every sentence, and to adhere as nearly as possible to the

CHAP. I.
ON HAPPINESS.
T was at atime, when a certain friend, whom I highly
value, was my guest. 7We had been sitting together,
entertaining ourselves with Shakespear. Among many of
his chara&amp;ters, we had looked into that of WVolsey. How
soon, says my friend, does the Cardinal in disgrace abjure
that happiness which he was lately so fond of? Scarcely
out of office, but he begins to exclaim,
Vain pomp and glory of the world! I hate ye.
So true is it, that our sentiments ever vary with the season;
and that in adversity we are of one mind, in prosperity of another. As for his niean opinion, said I, of human happiness,
it is a truth, which small refle6eion might have taught himn
long before. There seems little need of distress to inform us
of this. I rather commend the seeming wisdomn of that eastern
mnonarch, who in the affluence of prosperity, when he was
]proving every pleasure, was yet so sensible of their emptiness, their insufficiency to make -him happy, that he proclaim.n
ed a reward to the man, who should invent a new delight.
The reward indeed was proclaimed, but the delight was not
to be found. If by delight, said he, you mean some good;
something conducing to real happiness; it might have been
found perhaps, and yet not hit the monarch's fancy. Is that
said I, possible? It is possible, replied he, though it had been
the sovereign good itself. And indeed what wonder? Is it
probable that such a mortal as an eastern monarch; such a
pam'pered, flattered, idle mortal, should have attention, er:= _-                           - -~*Boo00 VI.              DIALOGUES.                     135
capacity for a subje7l so delicate? A subjea, enough to exer.
cise,the subtlest and most acute?
WHAT then is it you esteem, said I, the sovereign.good
to be? It *hould seem, by your representation, to be something very uncommon. Ask me not the question, said he,
you know not where it will carry us. Its general idea indeed is easy and plain; but the detail of particulars is perplexed and long; passions and opinions for ever thwart us;
a paradox appears in almost every advance. Besides, did
our inquiries succeed ever so happily, the very subje&amp; itself
is always enough to give me pain. That replied I, seems a
paradox indeed. It is not, said he, from any prejudice,
which I have conceived against it; for to man I esteem it
the noblest in the world. Nor is it for being a subje&amp;t, to
which my genius does not lead me; for no subje&amp;t at all
times has more employed my attention. But the truth is, I
can scarce ever think of it, but an unlucky story still occurs
to my mind. " A certain star-gazer, with his telescope was
"' once viewing the moon; and describing her seas, her
" mountains, and her territories. Says a clown to his corn" panion, Let himL spy what he pleases; we are as nea-r
" to the moon, as he and all his brethren."' So fares it,
alas! with these our moral speculations. Praaice too often
creeps, where theory-can soar. The philosopher proves as
weak, as those whom he most contemns.  A mortifying
thought to such as well attend it. Too nmortifying, replied
I, to be long dwelt on. Give us rather your general idea
of the sovereign good. This is easy from your own account,
however intricate the detail.
THUS then, said he, since you are so urgent, it is thus
that, I conceive it. The Sovereign Good is that, the possession of which renders us happy. And how, said 1, do we
possess it? Is it'sensual, or intellectual? There you are entering said he, upon the detail. This is beyond your question. Not a small advance, said I, to indulge poor curiosity?,Will you raise in me a thirst, and be so cruel not to allay it? It is not, replied he, of my raising, but your own.
Besides I am not certain, should I attempt to proceed whether you will admit such authorities as it is possible I may
vouch. That, said I, must be determined by their weiglht
and charater. Suppose, said he, it should be mankind;
the whole human race. WVould you not think it something
strange, to seek of those concerning Good, who pursue it
a thousand ways, and many of them contradiatory? I con136               MDIALOGUESo                   Chzap. I.
fess, said I, it seems so. And yet, continued he, were
there a point, in wvhich such dissentions ever agreed, this
agreement would be no mnean argumnient in favour of its trutth
and justness. But where, replicld I, is this argument to be
found?
HE answered 1me by asking, what if it should appear, that
there were certain original chatra&amp;elristics and pre-soncepti-'ons of good, which were natural, uniform alnd commonG0 to
ill nmien; which all recognized in tlihir various pursuits;
and that the difference lay only in the applying therm to par-'ticulars? This requires, said I, to be illustrated. As if continued he, a conmpany of travsellers, in some lt i. forest,
w'ere all intending for one city, but each by a rout'eculiar
to himself. The T roacds indeedl woui'l bc vadrious,1 an u all many
perhaps false; but all who travelled, would have one end
in view. It is evident, said I, they would. So:ares it thlen,
added lhe withi manlkind in the pursuit of good. Th1e ways
indeed are m"any, but what they seck is one.
Foa instance: Did you ever hear of any, who in purslit'i
of their good were for living the life of a b-ird, ani ilsedl, or
a fish. None. And why not? It would be incoinsisteait, answered I, with thleir nature. You see then, said he, they
all agree in this; that what they pursue, ought to be consi'stent, and agreeable to their proper nature. So oughlt it,
said I, undoubtedly. If so, continued he, one pre-conceplion is discovered, which is common to good in gener.'al: It
is, that all good is supposed something agreeable to nature.
This indeed, replied I, seems to be agreed on all ha-nds.
BUT again said lihe, Is there a man scarcely to be fouid!
of a tenlmper so truly mortified, as to acquiesce in the lowest,
alnd shortest neces.ar ies of life? V'Who aims not, if he be able,
at somethi:rg fart,hc;' somnething better? I replied scarcely
one. Do iiot multitudes pursue, said l-e, infinite obje&amp;s of..eisire, acklno wled: e. every one of them, to be in no respeit
ine essaries   LXqutisi'te vialals, delicious wines, splendid appai'el, ct19urious'gardens 9. nagnific{ent apartrinents adorned: it.h pictures and sculiptiAres; usic nd poetry, and the
whole tribe of eleganlt atts? It is evideulit, said I If it be,
continlied he, it sh-iould seem that"they all considered the
Chief or Sovereign Good, not to be that, which condtce.s to
bare existence ori mnere being,; for to this thle necessaries
alone are adequate.  I replied they were. Bui if ieo this, it
Ilnust be so-mewhlat conducive to:: th at, -hwhich is supe rior to
uaere being, It mu&gt;t -,, And--whit, con tiieleld hei ca a t!}i,'sBook VI.               DIALOGUES.                     137
be, but well-being, under the various shapes, in which different opinions paint it? Or can you suggest any thing else?
I replied, I could not.  Mark here, then, continued he, another pre-conception, in which they all agree; the Sovereign Good is somewhat conducive, not to mere being, but
to well-being. I replie{d, it had so appeared.
AGAIN, continued he. What labour, what expence- to
procure those rarities, which our own poor country is unable to afford us! How is the world ransacked to its utmost
verges, and luxury and arts imported from every quarter  
Nay more: How do we baffle nature herself; invert'her or--
der; seek the vegetables of spring in the rigours of'Winter,
and winter's ice dunrinli the heats of summer! I replied, we
did. And what disappointment, what remorse, when endeavours fail? It is ftrue. If this then be evident, said he,y
it would s-eem, that whatever we desire as our Chief and Soveeign; Good, is sormething whlich, as far as possible, we
would accom-odate to all places and times. I answered, Scr
it appearedl.  See then, said he, another of its charaEterni
stices, another pre-conception..
BuJT faxther still;'What contests for' wealth l What scrambling,for property 1 vVhat perils in thle pursuit! What solicitulde in; the maintenance! And why all this! To what purpose, what end? Or is n!ot the reason plain? Is it not that
wealth may co-ntinually procutre ius, whatever we fancy good;
antd make th-at peletual' wvhicth would otAherwise be tranlsi
eant? I replied, it seemed lso. Is it not farther desired, as
su.plDiyying usS fr'om ourlselves.; -when without it, we must be
beholdeni to the benevolence of others, and depend on their
caprice fo,r all that we eenjoy? It is true, said 1,. this, seems
a reason.
tAGAIN; Is not power of every degre'e as much contestecd
for as we; lth? Are not magistlraci:esy honours, principalities, and empire, the subieas- of strife and everlasting co.n.tentioni? I rep'lied, They were. And, why, said he, this?
To obtain what end? Is it not to help us-, like wealth, to
the p'osse ssion of what we desi-re? Is it not further to-ascertain. to secure our enjoyments; that when -others, wouldc
deprive us, we may be stron;g enou~gh to, resist them? I
replied, it was.
ORa to invert the- whole; -;Why are' there, who, see'k re.cesses-the most distant and retired; flee courts and: power,
and submit to parsimony and obscurity? Why all this,, bht
from the same in.tenution? From an opizion that small po.sessions, used moderately, are permanent: that larger possessions raise envy, and are more frequently invaded: that
the safety of power and dignity is more precarious thant
that of retreat; and that ttherelfore they have chosen, what
is imxost eligible upon the whole? It is not, said I, improbable, that they a6t by somne such motive,
Doyounot see then, continued he, two or three more
pre-conceptionsof the Sovereign Good, whlich are souglht
-r by all, as essential to constitute it? And what, sai(c I,
are these? That it should not be transient, nor derivecd
from the will of others, nor in their power to- take away;
but be durable, self-derived, and (if I may use the expression) indeprivable.  I confess, said I, it appears so. Butt
we have already found it to be considered, as something
agreeable to -our natur e; conducive, not to mere being,
but to well-being; and what we aim to have accommodated
to all places and times. We have.
TnEaRE may be other chara6iteristics, said he, but these I
think su icient. See then its idea; behold it, as collec;ed
froma the original, natural and universal pre-conceptions
of all i-ankind. The Sovereign Good, they hlave tauglht
uls ought to be something- a zreeable to o.- nczature; cond uc ive
*o well-being; accommodated to all places and times; durable7
self-derived, and indelprivable. Yo-ur accouunt, sacid I, appears just.
CIIAPP  II.
THE SAME SUBJECST.
BRUTUS perished iuntimely, and Cs,ar dlid io more.--
These words I was repeat ing the next day to mysel-,.when riay friend appeared, and cherf:ulliy bade ne goodmorrow. I could not return'hiis com-plimnr-ent witLh an equal
gaiety, being intent, so-miewhat more than usual, on whatt
had passed the day before. Seeinjg thlis he proposed a walkli
into the fields. The fce of nature, said he, will perhaps
dispel these glooms. No assistaace. on my part, shall be
wanting, you may be assured.  I accepted his proposal; the
walk began; and our form er conversation insensibly renewed.
BRuTus, said he, perished unmti-mely, and Ctesar did no
-more.-It, was thus, as I rcme-member, not long since you
were expressing? yourself. And yet suppose their fortunes to
hav~ been elatly parallel-WY,hich would yo0 h0ave pretieDIALOGUES -0~ S

red 7 Would you have been Czsar, or Brutus? Brutus,
replied I, beyond all controversy. He asked me, Whlly?'
Where waa the difference, when their fortunes, as we no~W
supposed them, were considered as the same? There seems
said I, abstra6l from their fortunes, something,. I know not
what, intrinsically preferable in the -life and chaa aer- of
Brutus. If that, said he, be trufe, then must we derive it,
not from" the success of his endeavours; but from their truth
and lieeUitude. He h-ad the comfort-to be colisciouls, - thatliig
cause was a just one. It was impossible the other should have:
any such feeling. I believe, said I, you have explained it.
SUppOSE then, continued he, (it is but merely an hyp: 2
thesis) suppose, I say, we were to pltace-the'SovereigG-io:i]in such a teaitude of con-Idu1, in the Condurl ne mne elf, atidi
not inthe Event. Suppose we were to fix our'I-appinesinot in the atual attainment of that health, that pelife idlo
of a social state, that fortunate concurrence of externals,
wlich is congruous to our nature, anct vwhich all have a
right to pursue; but solely fix it in the mere doingv whatever is correspondent to such. an end, even though we never
attainl, or are near attaining it. In fewer words; What if
we make our natural state the standard only to determine
our condu t; and place our happiness in the reltitude of this
conduat alone'? On such an hypothesis (and we consider it as
nothing farther) we should not wt:lnt a good, perhaps, to
correspond to our pre-conceptions; Tor this, it is -evident,
would be correspondent to them  all. Your doctrine, replied I, is so new and strang'e, that though youl have been
copious in -explaining,  I can hardly yet comprehend you.
IT amounlts all, said he, but to this: Place your happiness, where your praise is. I asked, tWhere he supposed
that? Not, replied he, in the pleasures which: you feel,
more than your disgrace lies in the pain; not in the casial
prosperity of fortune, more than your disgrace. in the casual
adversity; but in justi complete naftion throu-ghout every
part of life, whatever be the face of things) whether favourable or the contrary.
BuT why then, said I, such accuracy about externals?
So much pains to be informed, what are pursuable, what
avoidable i It behoves the. Pilot, replied he, to know the
seas and the winds; the nature of tempests, calms and tides.
They are the subjeets, about which hlis art is conversant.
xWithout a just experience of thern, he canl lnever prove hiriself an artist, Yet we look not for his reputation either in140              DIALOGUES.                     CThatp. I
fair gales, or in adverse; but in the skilfulness of his condnu, be these eventSs as they happen. In like manner
fares it with the moral artist. He, for a subje&amp;t, has thewhole of human life: health and sickness; pleasure and
pain; with every other possible incident, which can befal
him during his existence. If his knowledge of all these be
accurate and exadt, so too must his conduct, in which we
place his happiness. But if his knowledge be defective,
must not his conduct be defective also? I replied, So it
should seem. And if his conduct, then his happiness? It
is true.
You see then, contined he, even though externals were
as nothing; though it was true, in their own nature, they
were neither good nor evil; yet an accurate knowledge of
them is, from our hypothesis, absolutely necessary. Indeed,
said I, you have proved it.
-IE continued-Inferior artists may be at a stand, because
they want materials. From their stubborness and intractability, they may-often be disappointed. But as long as life
is passing, and nature continues to operate, the mnoral arltist
of life has at all times all he desires. HIe can never want
a subject fit to exercise him in his proper calling; and tha~t
with this happy nmotive to the constancy of his endeavours,
that the crosser, the harsher, the more untoward the events,;
the greater his praise,. the more illustrious his reputation.
AI, this) said J, i's true, and cannot be cldeied. Buti
one circumstaance there appears, where your simile seeml to
fail. The praise indceed of the Pilot we allow to be in his
conduct; &gt;but it is in the success of that conduct, where we
look for his happiness. If a storm  arise-, and. the ship be
lost, we ca,ll himi not happy,, how well soever he may have
conducuted it. It is then only we congratulate him, when
he has reacled the desired haven. You.r distinction, said
he, is just. And it is here lies the noble prerogative of
moral artists, above all othiers. But yet I know not how to'
explain myself, I fear my doctrine will appear so strangeo
You may proceed, staid I, safily, since you advance it but,
as an hypothesis.
THus then, continued he-The end in other arts is ever
distant and removed. It consists not in the mere conduct,
much less in a single energy;, but is the just result of many
energies, each of which are essential to it. Hence, by oh.stacles unavoidable, it may o-ften be retarded: nay moro?,
may be so embarrassed, as never possibly to be attained. ButBook VI.               DIALOGC'UES.                   141.
in the moral art of life, the very conduEi  is the End; the
very condu&amp;, I say, itself, throughout every its minutest
energy;:because each of these, however nminute, parttake as
truly of rectitude, as the largest combinations of them, when
Considered collectively. HIence, of all arts this is tlhe only

to observe, said 1, the course'of ourt inquiries. A nhew hy:_
pothesis has bee-n advanced: appearing somnewhat strang'e,
it is desired to'e explained. You comply with the req(uest,
and in pursuit of the explanation, make-it ten times nigre
obscure and unintelIigible' than before. It is but too often
the fate, said, he, of us commentators. But you kno.w in
such case, what is usually done.  WVhen the comment will
not explain the text, wve try whether the text will not explain itself. ThI-is method, it is possible, m1ay assist us here.
The hypothesis, which we would have illustrated, was- no
more than this: That the Sovereign Good lay in- rectitude
of Conduct; and that this Good -corresponded to all our p1reconceptions.. Let us.. examine then, whether, upon trial,
this correspendence will appear to hold-; and, for all that
we have advanced since, suifer it to pass, and not perplex
us, Agreed, sai:d I, willingly, for now I hope to comprehend you.
RI.COLLECT then said he, Do you not rememuber that
one pre-conception of the Sovereign Good, was to be accommodated to all times and places? I remember it. And
is the-re any time, or any place, whence- Rectitude of Con-,
duct may be excluded? Is there not a right action in prosperity, a right action in adversity? May there not be a decent, generous, and-laudable behaviour, not only in peace,
in power, and health; but in war, in oppression, in, sick,

fail to express sous.elves emphatically, and seldom  place
the emphasis improperly.   Wi.thres?ppe to artificial helps,

reader, by not leaving him at full'liberty to follow his
own understanding and feelings.
THE most common faults respeaing emphasis are, taying so strong an emphasis on one word as to leave no power of giving a particular force to other words, which,
though not equally; are in a certain- degree emphatical;
and placing the;greatest stress on conjunfcive particles,
and other words of secondary importance.     These faultqa
are strongly charaEterised, in Churchill's censure of MosA

EXPHASIS is often destroyed by an injudicious attempt
to read melodiously.  Agreeable inflexions and easy variations of the voice, as far as they arise from, or are
consistent with just speaking, are deserving of attention.
But to substitute one unmeaning tune, in the room of all
the proprieties and graces of good elocution, and then to
applaud this manner, under the appellation of rnusical
speaking, can only be the effe&amp;E of great. ignorance and
inattention, or of a depraved taste.   If public speaking
must be musical,) let the Words be set to music in recitative, that these melodious speakers may no longer lie
open to the sarcasm; Do you read or sing?     f you siyng,'you.sing very ill.  Seriouslyj it is much to be wondered
BA&amp;Dn what shall we say to those other pre-conceptions; to
being durable, self-derived, and indeprivable? Can there
be any Good so durable, as the power of always doing right?
Is there any Good conceivable, so entirely beyond the power
of others? Or, if you hesitate, and are doubtful, I would
willingly be informed, into what circumstances may fortune;

MRe itude of Condu6t, if a Good, is a Good indeprivable. I

BUT faitheer said he: A-nother pre-conception of t(he Sovereign Gooli was, to be agreeable to nature. It w-vas. And
can any thing be more agreeable to a rational and social animal, t'han rational and social condua.? Nothing. But rectitude of Conduct is with us Rational and Social ConduCt.
It is.
ONcE -iore, continued he; Another pre-conception of
this Geod was, to be conducive not to nmere-being, but to
well-being. Admit it. And can any thing, believe you,
conduce so probably to the well-being of a rational, social
animal, as the right exercise of that reason, and of those social affecions? Nothing. And what is this same exercise,
but the highest ReCtitcude of ConduCt? Certainly.

CHAP. VI.
SIR JOHN MELVIL AND STERLING.
STERL. NWHAT        are your commands with me, Sir
SIR JOHN. After having carried the negociation between
our families to so great a length, after having assented so
readily to all your proposals, as well as received so many
instances of your cheerful compliance with the demands
made on our part, I am extremely concerned, Mlr. Sterling
to be the involuntary cause of any uneasiness.
STERL. Uneasiness! what uneasiness? ~Wherebusiness is
transacted as it ought to be, and the parties understand one
another, there can be no uneasiness. You agree, on such and
such conditions, to receive niy daughter for a wife; on the
same conditions I agree to receive you as a son-in-law; and
as-to all the rest, it follows of course, you know, as regularly as the payment of a bill after acceptance.
SIR JOHN. Pardon me, Sir; nmore unieasiness has arisen
than you are aware of. I am myself, at this instant, in a
state of inexpressible embarrassment; Miss Sterling, I know)
is extremely disconcerted too; and unless you will oblitge
me with the assistance of your friendship, I foresee the
speedy progress of discontent and animosity througlh the
whole family.
STERL. What the deuce is all this? I do not understand
a single syllable.
SIR JOHN. In one word then, it will be absolutely impossible for me to fulfil my engagements in regard to Mliss
Sterlling.
STERL. HOW, Sir John? Do you mlean to put an affront upon mly family? ~What! reftuse toSIR JoHN. Be assured;, Sir, that l neither mean to affront, nor forsake your family. My only fear is, that you
should desert me; for the wh.ole happiness of my life depends on my being connected with your family by the
nearest and tenderest ties in the world.
STERL. VVhly, did not you tell me, but at moment ago,
it was absolutely inmpossible for you to marry my daughter.
SIR JOHN. True: But you have another daughter, SirSTEAL. Well?
SIR JOHN. Who has obtained the most absolute dominion
over my heart. I have already declared my passion to her;'46
Ct17at. VI,ffok   l V.           DIALOGUES.                    147
nay, Miss Sterling herself is also apprised of it, and if you will
but give santaion to my present addresses, the uncommon
merit of AMiss Sterling will no doubt recommend her to a
person of equal, if not superior rank to myself, and our families may still be allied by my union with Miss Fanny.
STERL. Mighty fine, truly I Why, what the plague do
you makle of us, Sir Jdhn? Do you come to market for tny
daughters, like servants at a statute-fair? Do you think
that I will suffer you, or any man in the world to come into lm-y house, like the Grand Signior, and throw the handkerchief first to one, and then to t'other, just as he pleases?
Do you tlhink I drive a kind of Afi-ican slave-trade with
then? and-----
SIR John. A moment's patience, Sir! Nothing but
the excess of my passion for Miss Fanny should have induced
me to take any step that had the least appearance of disrespe6t to any part of your family: and even now I am desirous to atone for my transgression, by nlaking the most ade.
quate comnpensation that lies in my power.
STERL. Compensation    what compen3ation  can  you
possibly make in such a case as tliis, Sir John?
SIR JOHN. Come, come Mr. Sterling; I know youv to
be a man of-sense, and a man of business, a man of the
world.  I will deal frankly with you; and you shall see that
1- do not desire a change a ofm sures for my own gratification,
witlhout endeavouring to make it advantageous to you.
SLERL. What advantage can your inconstancy be to
me, Sir John?
SiR JOHN, I will tell you, Sir-. You know that by the
articles at present subsisting between us, on the day of my
marriage witlh Miss Sterling, you agree to pay' down the'
gross sum of eighty thousand pounds.
STREL. Well?
SIR JOHN. Now if you will but consent to my waving
that marriage--
STERL. I agree to your waving that marriage? Impossible, Sir John!
SIR JOHN. I hope not, Sir; as on my part, I will agree
to wave my right to thirty thousand pounds of the fortune
I was to receive with her.
STERL. Thirty thousand, do you say?
SIR JOH1N. Yes, Sir; and accept of Miss Fanny, with
fifty thousand, instead of fourscore.
STER L. Fifty thousand---,148             DIALOGUES.                    Chap. V/I
SIR JOHN. Instead of fourscore.'STERL. IWVhy, why, ther,e may be something in that.
Let me see; Fanny with fifty thousand instead of BcAtsey
with fourscore. But how can this be, Sir John? For you
know I am to pay this money into the hands of my Lord
Ogleby; who, I believe, betwixt you and me, Sir John, is
not over-stocked with ready money at present; and threescore thousand of it, you know, is to go to pay off the present incumbrances on the estate, Sir John.
SIR JOEIN. That objedion is easily- obviated. Ten of
the twenty thlousand, whicli would re'Cain as a surplus of
the fourscore, after payin,r off the morttage,  was intended
by his Lordship for imy use, that we- ii-t set ofi with some'ittle eclat on our mnzaaiage; and the olite-:, ten for his own.
Ten thousand pounds therefore I shlall be able to pay you
immediately; and fol the remaining twenty thousand yotu
shall have a mortgage on that part of the estate which is to
be made over to ime, with whlatever security you shall require for the regular payment of the i.ntr;est, till the principal is duly discharged.
STERL. WVhy to do you justice, Sir Johln, tliere is sonething fair and open in youri proposal; and since I find you
do not mean to put nli aflfront upon the family--
StlI J01N. Nothing was ever farther friom my thoughts,
Mr. Sterling. Arid after all, the whole afiair is nothing extlraordinary; such llthings happen every day; and as the world
had only heard generally of a treaty between the fiamilies,
when this marriage takes place, no body will be the wiser,
if we have but discretion enough to keep ourt own counse-l.
S'rERT. True, true; and since you only transfevi frac
one girl to the other, it is no'more than transferr1nlg so nMuclb
stock, you knovw.
SIR JOHN. The very thling.
STERL. Odso i I had quite folgot. W,~Ve are reckoninu
Without our host here. Theire is another difScultv-  
Sir JOHN. You alarm me. \Vhat can th,a.t be?
STERL. I cannot stir a step in this business without consulting my sister Heidelberg. The famrily has very great expedtations froim her, and we must not give lher any offence.
Sir JOHN. But if you come into this i}measure, surely she
wvill be so kind as to consentSTEIL. I do not know that. Betsey is her darling, and
I cannot tell how far she may resent any slight that seems

the best I can for you. You shall go and break the matter
to her first) and by the time that I may suppose that your
rhetoric has prevailed on her to listen to reason, I will step
in to reinforce your airguments.
SIR JOHN, I will fly to her immediately: you promise me
your assistance?
STERL. I do.
SIR JOHN. Ten thousand thanks for it! and now success
attend me!
STERL. Harkee, Sir John!-Not a word of the thirty
thousand to my sister, Sir John.
SI-R JOHN. Oh, I am dumb, I am dumb, Sir.
STERL. You remember it is thirty thousand.
SIR JOHN. To be sure I do.
STERL. But, Sir John! one thing more, My Lord must
know nothing- of this stroke of friendship between us.
SIR JOHN. Not for the world. Let mne alone! let me
alone  
STERL. And whn- every thing is agreed, we must give
each other a bond to be held fast to the bargain.
SIR JOHN. To be sure. A bond by all means! a bond,
or whatever you please.
STERL. I should have thought of more conditions, he is
in a humour. to give me every thing. WVhy, what mere
children are your f:llows of quality; that cry for a plaything
one minute, and throw it lby the next!. as changeable as the

drive a bargain a1nd yet they are to take tare of the interest

with as much indifiterence as if it was a China orange. By
this mortgage, I shall have a hold on his Terra Firma; and
irf he wants more money, as he certainly will, let him have
children by my daughter or no, I shall have his whole estate

met between this and thle river-side?
BE.L. Innumerable! Your' town's as full of defiles as,

STOCK. I am sorry you have been so incomrmoded.
BEL. Why, faiths, it was all my owl fault; accustomed'
to a land of slaves, and out of patience with the whole
tribe of: custom-house extortioners, boatmen, tide-waiters,:
and water-bailiffs, that beset me- on all sides. worse than a
swarm of musquetoes, I proceeded a little too roughly tol
brush them away with my rattan;: the sturdy rogues tookthis in dudgeon, and beginning to rebel, the mob chose dif-'ferent sides, and a furious scuffle ensued; in the course of
which, my person and apparel suffered so much, that I was

happy stars have given me a good estate, and thle conspiring
winds hlave blown mle hither to spend it.
STOCK. To use it, not to waste it, I should hope; to treat
it, Mr. Belcour, notas a vassal, over whom you have a wvanton despotic power, but as a subje6t, which you are bound to
govern with a temperate and restrained authority.
BEL. True, Sir; most truly said; mine's a commission,
not a right: I am the offspring of distress and every childc
of sorrow is my brotier; while I have hands to 1hold therefore, I will hold tlihe  open to mankind, but,. Sir, my passions are mny masters; t-liey take me where they will; and
oftentime they leave to reasoni and virtue nothing but niy
wishles and my sighs.

would take it up: I would to Heaven you had leisure for
the employ! but,' did you (lrive a trade to the four corners
of the world, you would not find the task so toilsome as to
keep me free fronr faults.

me I should not h1ave the fault of self-conceit to combat;
that, at least,'is not amongst the number.

CHI-AP. VIII.
LORD EUSTACE AND FRAMPTON.
In. En E'wI7E LL,     dy dear Frampton, have you secured the letters?AN- ESSAY ON
at, that this kind of reading, which has so little merit
considered as music, and none at all considered as speaking, shcu'd be so studiously pra&amp;tised by many speakers,
and so much admired by:- many hearers. Can  methocl
of reading, which is st entirely different from the usual
manner of conversation, be natural and right? Is it pos-'sible that all the varieties of sentiment,  which a public
speaker has occasion to introduce, should be properly expressed by one melodious tone and cadence, employed
-like on all occasions and for all purposes?
R U L E     ~VII..cfquire a just variety of Pause and Cadence.
(NE of the worst faults a speaker can have;s tuo make
no other pauses than what he finds barely necessary
for breathing. I know of notlhing that such a speaker can
so properly be compared to, as an alarm-ibell, which,
when once set a-going, clatters onl till the weight thlat
moves it is-run down. Without pauses, the sense mnist
always appear confused and obscure, and often be misunderstood; and the spirit and energ) of the piece must be
wholly lost.
IN executing this part of the office of a speaker, it will
by no means be sufficient to attend to the points used in
printing; for these are far from marking all the pauses
which ought to be made in speaking, A mechanical attention to these resting-places has perhaps been one chief
cause of monotony, by leading the reader to a uniform
sound at every imperfe&amp; break, and a uniform cadence
at every full period. The use of points is to assist the
reader in discerning the grammatical constru&amp;ion, not to
direat his pronunciation. In reading, it may often be
proper to make a pause where the prihter has made none.

LD. EUST. As to the matter of property, Frampton, we
will'pot dispute mucll about that. Necessity, you know,
may sfmettmes rendler a trespass excusable.
FRA,I. I ami not casuist sufficient to answer you upon that
subje6t; but this I know, that you have already trespassed
against the laws of hospitality and honour, in your condu6t
towards Sir William Evans, and his daughter--And as your
friend and counsellor, both, I would advise you to think seriously of repairing the injuries you have committed, andt
not increase your offence, by a farther violation.
LD. EUST. It is atually  a pity you were not bred to the
bar, Ned; but I have only a moment to stay, and am all
impatience to know, if there be a letter from Langwood,
and what he says.
F11AM. I shali never be able to afford you the least information, upon that subjeCt, my lord.
LD. EUST. Surely, I do not understand you. You said
you had secured the letters--Iave you not read them?
FRAM. You have a right, and none but you, to ask me
such a question. My weak compliance with your first proposal relative to these letters, warrants your thinking so
meanly, of me. But know, my lord, that though my personal affetion for you, joined to my unhappy circumstances)
may have betrayecl me to actions unworthy of myself, I never can forg.et, that tlhere is a barrier fixed before the extreme of baseness, which honour will not let me pass.
LD. Eus'i. You will give mie leave to tell you, Mr. Erampton, that where i lead, I t1hink you need not halt.
FRAM. You will pardon re, imy lord; the conscioustness
of another rlan's errors, can never be a justification for our
own; and poor, indeecl, must that wretch be, who can be
satisfied with the negative merit of not being the worst man
he knows.
LD. Eusr. If this discourse were uttered in a conventicle, it might have its effe&amp;; by setting the congregation to

FRAM. It is rather meant to rouse, than lull your lordship.
LD. EUST. No matter what it is meant for; give me the
letters, Mr. Frampton.

LD. EusT. I shall not come to you, to heal the wound:
your medicines are too rough and coarse for me..F-R.AM. The soft poison of flattery, might, perhaps, please
you better.
LD. EuST. Your conscience may, probably, have as much
neeI of palliatives, as mine, Mr. Prampton, as I am pretty
well convinced, that your course of life, has not been more
regular than my own.::FRAM. With,true contrition, my lord, I confess part of
your sarcasm to be jtust. Pleasure was the objec of my
pu-rsuit, and pleasure I obtained, at the expence, both of
heailth, and fortune: but yet, my lord, I broke not in upon the peace of others; the laws of hospitality I never violated; nor didl I ever seek to injure, or seduce, the wife or
edughter of my friend.
LD. EusT. I care not what you did; give me the letters.
FRANx. I have no right, to keep, and therefore shall surrender them, -though with the utmost reluaance; but, by
ourformer firiendslhip, I intreat you not to open them.
LD. EuST. That you hale forfeited.
FRAM. Since it is not in my power- to prevent yourt cominittilng an errorl, which you oght, foir ever, to repentof,
I wi.1 not be a witness of it. There are the letters.
LD,. EsT. Youl may, perhaps, have cause to repent
your present condu6lt, Mr. Frampton, as much as I do our
past attachmnent.

terms) I resign it for ever. Farewell, my lord.

though it'may sornetimes be serviceable to ourselves.

LD. EUST. The proofs of your regard have been rather
painful of late, Mrl; Frampton.
FaM.n. When I see nmy friend upon t!he verge of a precipice, is that a time foir conpliment? Shall I not rudely
rush forwardt and drag him from it: Just in that state you
are atpresent, and I will strive to save Vyou. Virtue may
languish in a noble heart, and sufi'er her rival, vice, to
usurp her power; but baseness must.hot enter, or she flies
for ever. The man who has forfeited his own esteem.
thinks all the world has, the same consciousness, and therefore is what he deserve to be, a vretch.

FRAM. No, my dear Eustace, I have savedI you; from
one, friom your own reproaches, by preventing your being
guilty ofxmeanness, which you could never have forgiven
yourself.

Than that of painting pomp? Are not these woods
Mlore free from peril, than the envious court?

And churlish chiding of the winter's wind;

Even till I shrink with cold, I smile, and say,
This is no flattery; these are counsellors'
That feelingly persuade me what I am.

And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones, and good in every thing.
-COME, shall we go. and kill us venison!
And yet it irks me, the poor dappled fools,
Being native burghers of this desert city,
Should, in their own confines, with forked heads
Have their round haunches gor'd.
LORD. Indeed, my Lord,
The melancholy Jaques grieves at that;
And in that kind swears you do more usurp
Than doth your brother that hath banished you.
To day mny L,ord of Amiens, and myself,
Did steal behind him, as he lay along
Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood;
To the which place a poor sequestered stag,
That from -the hunters' aim had ta'en a hurt,
Did come to languish; and indeed, my Lord,
The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans
Th-at theirdischarge did stretch his leathern coat
Almost to bursting; and the big round tears
Cours'd one another down his innocent nose
In piteous chase; and thus the haiiry fool,
Muchl marked of the Melancholy Jaques,
Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,
Augmenting it with tears.

That fools should be so deep contemplative:
And I did laugh, sans intermission,
An hour by l'i- dial. O noble fool,
A worthy fool! motley's the only wear.
DUKE. What fool is this?
JA% O worthy fool! one that hath been a courtier,
And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
WVhich is as dry as the remainder-bisket
After a voyage-he hath strange places cramm'd
With obseryations, the which he vents,
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
I am ambitious for a motley coat.
DUKE. Thou shalt have one.
JAQ% It is my only suit;
Provided, that you weed your better judgments
Of all opinion, that grows rank in them,
That I am wise. I must have liberty
Withal, as large a charter as the wind.
To blow on whom I please; for so fools have,
And they that are most galled with my folly
They most must laugh. And why, Sir, must they so?
The wvhly is plain, as -way to parish-church;
He whom a fool does very wisely ~hit,
Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
Not to seem senseless of the bob. If not,
The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd
Even by the squand'ring glances of a fool.
Invest nme in my motley, give me leave
To speak my mind, anda I will through and through
Cleanse the foul body of th' inlfeJted world,
If they will patiently receive my medicine.
DUKE.. Fie on thee! I can tellt what thou would'st do.
JAO Wlhat, for a counter, would I do but good?
DUKE. Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;
For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
And all th' embossed sores and headed evils,
That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
JAQ  Why, who cries out on pride,
That can therein tax any private party
QDoth it not ftow as hugely as the sea,
Till that the very mean3 do ebb?
What woman in the city do I name,
When that I say, the city-woman bears
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
Who can come in, and say,.that I mean her;
When such a one as she, such is'her neighbour?
Or what is he of basest funEtion,
That says his bravery is not on my cost;
Thinking, that I mean him, but therein suits
His folly to the metal of my speech?
There then; how then? what then? let me see wherein
My tongue has wrong'd him; if it do him right,
Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
Why then, my taxing, like a wild goose, flies
Unclaim'd of any man.

The image of the King whom I presented;
And struck me in my very seat of judgment;
WVhereon, as an offender to your father,
I have bold way to my authority,
And did commit you. If the deed were ill,

That guards the peace and safety of your person:
Nay more, to spurn at your most royal image,
And mock your working in a second body,
Question your royal thoughts, make the case your's;
Be now the father, and propose a son;
Hear your own dignity so much profan'd;
See your most dreadful laws so loosely slightedi;
Behold yourself so by a son disdained:

And in your pow'r so silencing your son.

Therefore still bear the balance and the sword;
And I do wish your honours may increase,

Offend you, and obey you, as I did:
So shall I live to speak my father's words;
Happy am I, that have a man so bold
That dares do justice on my proper son;
And no less happy, having such a son,
That would deliver up his greatness so
Into the hand of Justice.-You committed me;
For which I do commit into your hand
Th' unstained sword that you have us'd to bear;
With this remembrance, that you use the same
With a likebold, just, and impartial spirit,
As you have done'gainst me. There is my hand,
You shall be as a father to my youth:
My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear;
And I will stoop and humble my intents,
To your well praatis'd, wise direaions.
And, Princes all, believe me, I beseech you;
My father is gone:wide into his grave;
For in his tomb lie my affedtions;
And with his spirit sadly I survive,
To mock the expeaations of the world;
To frustrate prophecies, and to raze out
Rotten opinion, Which hath writ me down
After my seeming. Though my tide of blood
Hath proudly flow'dl in vanity till now;

In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.

able pause, where the grammatical construalioti requires
none at all. In doing this, however, it is necessary that
in the word immediately preceding the pause, the'voice
be kept up in such a manner as to intimate to the hearer
that the sense is not compleated.  Mr. GARRICK oftern
observed this rule with great success. This particular
excellence Mr. Sterne has described in his usual sprightly'Ananner.  See the following work, Book VI. Chap. IlLT
BzFoRE a full pause, it has been customary in readling
to drop the voice in a uniform manner; and this has been
called the cadeltce. But surely nothing can be more de.
struaive of all propriety and energy than this habits  The
tones and heights at the close of a sentence ought to be in.
finitely diversified, according to the general nature of thim
discourse, and the particular construdion and meaning,
of the sentenHe.  In plain narrative, and especially in art
gumentation, the least attentiotl to the manner in which
we relate a story, or,support an argument in conversation,
will show, that -it is more frequently proper to raise tha
voice than to fall it at the endtof a sentence.  Interrogatives, whe-re the speaker seems to expe&amp; an answer,
should almnost always be elevated at the close, with a pe.
culiar tone, to indicate that a question is asked. Some
sentences are so construated, that the last word requires
a stronger emphasis than any of the preceding; whilst
others admit of being closed with a soft and gentle sound,
Where there is nothing in the sense which requires the
last sound to be elevated or emphatical, an easy fall, sufficient to show that the sense is finished, will be proper.
And in pathetic pieces,'especially those of the plaintive,
tender, or solemn kind, the tone of the passion will often
require a still lower cadence of the voice. But before a
speaker c^an be -able to fall his voice with propriety and
judgment at the close of a sentence, he must be able to
keep i-t from falling, and to raise it with all the variation
which the sense requires. The best method of correAing
a uniform cadence, is frequently to read select sentences,
in which the style is pointed, and frequent antitheses are
introduced; and argumentative pieces, or such as abound
with interrogatives.162 ~      DIALOGUES,.                 Clhap. Xli.

Within his- truncheon's length; whilst they (distill'd
Almost to jelly with th' effec -of fear)
Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me

BRUTUS AND CASSIUS.
Cs. W'VILL you go see the order of the course?
BRU. Not I.
CAS. I pray you, do.
BRU. I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
Of that quick spirit that is in.Antony;
Let me not hinder. Cassilvs, your desires;
I'll leave you.
CAS. Brutus, I do observI you, now of late;
I have not from your eyes that gentientless
And show of love as I wras wont to have;
Y'ou bear too stubboi'n and too strange a hand
Over your frieind that loves you.
Bru. Cassius,
Be not deceived: if I have reitl'd my look,
I turn the troubilec of my countenance
Mlerely upon tmyself. Vexed I aim
Of late with passions of some difference,
Conceptions only proper to myself;
WVhich give some soil perhaps to my behaviour;
But let not therefore my good friends be griev'd.
Among which numinler, Cassius, be you one;
Nor construe any farther my neglect,
Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
Forgets the shews of love to other men.
CAs. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
By means whereot, this breast of mine hath buried
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
BRu. No, Cassius: for the eye sees not itsell
But by refiefltion fro-n some ot4-er thing.
CAs.'Tis just.
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
That you have no such rtirror as will- turn.166            DIALOGUES.                  Clapa. XIK
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
That yout might see your shadow. I have heard,
WVhere many of the best respeEt in Rome,
(Except immortal CTsar) speakiing of Brutus,
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
-lave wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
BRU. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
That you would have me seek into myself
For that which is not in me 2
CAS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepar'd to hear;
And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by refleaion, I, your glass,
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which yet you know not of.
And be not jealous of me, gentle Brutus:
Were I a conmmon laugher, or did use
Tlo steal wiith ordinary oaths my love
To every new protestor; if you know,
That I'do fawn on men, and hug them hard,
And after scandal them; or if you know,
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout; then hold me dangerous.
BRu. W-What means this shouting? I do fear the peopl,
Chuse C;esar for their king-.
CAs. Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.
BRu. I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me 7
If it be aught toward the genelral good,
Set Honour in one eye, and Death i' th' other,
Anld I will look on Deatl indifferently:
For let the'gods so speed me, as I love
The narne of Honour mnore tlhan I fear death.
CAs. I know that virtue to-be in you, Brutus,
As well as I do know your outward favour.
WVell, honour is the subject of my story.--
I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life; but for my single self,
I had as lief not be, as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself.

We both have fed as well;; and we can both
Endure the winter's cold as well as he,
For once upon a raw and gusty day,
The troubled Tyber chasing with his shores,
Cxsar says to me, Dar'st thou, Cassius, now
Leap in with me into this angry floocd,
And swim to yonder point?-Upon the word,
Accountred as I was, I plunged in,
Ain'bid him follow; so indeed he did.
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews? throwing it aside,
And stemming it with hearts of controversy.
But ere we could arrive the point propos'd,
Czsar cry'd, help me, Cassius, or I sink.
I, as.Eneas, our great ancestor,
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
The old Anchises bear; so from the waves of Tyber
Did I the tired Cxasar: and this man
Is now become a god; and Cassius is
A wretched creature, and must bend his body,
If Czsar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
And when the fit was on him, I did mark
How he did shake.'Tis true this god did shake;
His coward lips did from their colour fly,
And that same eye whose bend does awe the world,
Did lose its lustre; I did hear him groan:
Ay, and that tongue of his, that bade the Romans
Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,
Alas [ it cry'd-Give me some drink, TitiniusAs a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me,
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world,
And bear the palm alone.
Bau. Another general shout!  
I do believe, that these applauses are
For some new honours that are heaped on Czesar.
CAS. Why man, he doth bestride the narrow world
Like a Colossus! and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs, and peep about
To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
Men at sometimes are masters of their fates:
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
Brutus-and Cx-sar--what should be in C;esar?
Why should that name be sounded, imiore than your's?
\Vrite them together; your's ist as fair a naime:
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
Weigh them it is as heavy; conjure with'em,
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Cxesar.
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
Upon what meats does this our Cesar feed,
That he is grown so great? Age, thou azrt sham'd  
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods.
When went there by an age, since the great flood,
But it -was fam'd with more than with one man?
When could they say, till now, that talk'd of Rome,
That her wide walls encompass'd but one man  
Oh! you and I have heard our fathers say,
There was -a Brutus, one that would have brook'd
Th' eternal devil, to keep his state in Rome
As easily as a king.
Bru. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
WVhat you would work me to, I have some aim:
How I have thought of this, and of these times)
I shall recount hereafter: for this present,
I would not (so with love I mnight intreat you)
Be any further mov'd. VWhat you have said,
I will consider; what you have to say,
I will with patience hear and find a tirne
Both meet to hear, and answer such high things,
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this;
Brutus hadl rather be a villager,
Than to repute himself a son of Rome
Under such hard conditions as this time
Is like to lay upon us.
CAS. I am glad that my weak words
HIave struck but thtus much shew of fire from Bruttus.

SENSIBILITY.
D'EAR    Sensibility! source inexhausted- of all that's
precious in our joys, or costly in our sorrows! thouA
chainest thy martyr down upon his bed of straw, and it is
thou who liftest him up to Heaven. Eternal Fountain of
outr feelings! It is here I trace thee, and this is thy divinity which stirs within me: not, that in some sad and
sickening moments,' my soul shrinks back upon herself
and startles at destruftion'-mere pomp of words! but that
I -feel some generous joys and generous cares beyond my.
self-all comes from thee, great, great Sensorium of the
vorld! which vibrates, if a hair of our head but falls upon
the ground, in the remotest desert of thy creation. Touched
with thee, Eugenius draws my curtain when I languish;
hears my tale of symptoms, and blames the weather bfor the
disorder of his nerves. Thou givest a portion of it sometimes to the roughest peasant who traverses the bleakest
mountains.-He finds -the lacerated lamb of another's flock.
This moment I beheld him leaning with his head against
his crook, with piteous inclination lookingdown upon it
Oh! had I come one moment sooner!-it bleeds to death
-his gentle heart bleeds with it.
PEACE to thee, generous swain! I see thou walkest off
with angtiish- but thy joys shall balance it; for happy is
thy cottage, and happy is the sharer of it, and happy are
the lambs which sport about you.

R U   L E- VIII.
Accompany the Emotions and Passionzs which your words
express, by correspondent tones, looks and gestutres.
THERE       is the language of emotions and passions,
as well as of ideas. To express the latter is the pe.
culiar province of words; to express the former, nature
teaches us to make use of tones, looks, and gestures.
When anger, fear, joy, grief, love, or any other active
passion arises in our minds, we naturally discover it by
the pagrticuilar manner in which we utter our words; by
the features of the countenance, and by other well-kntown
signs. And even when we speak without any of the more
violent emotiols, some kind of feeling usually accompanies our words- and this, whatever it be, hath its propel
externml expression. Expression hath indeed been so little sttudied in public speaking, that we seem almost to
have forgotten the language of nature, and are ready to
consider every attempt to recover it as the labour and affected effort of art. Bttt nature is always the same; and
every judicious imitation of it will alwayS be pleasing.
INor can any one deserve the appellation of a good speaker, much less of a complete orator, till to distin&amp;c articulation, a good command of voice, and just emphasis, he
is able to add the -various expressions of emotion ancd
passion.
To enumerate these expressions, and describe them ia.
all their variations, is impraCticable. Attempts have beenr'made with some success to analyse the language of ideas;'but the'language of sentiment and emotion has never yet
been analysed; 4nd perhaps it is not within the reach of
human ability, to write a Philosophical Grammar of the
Passions. Or, if it were possible in any-degree to execute this design, I cannot think, that from such a gram-l
mnar it would ble possible for any one to instruCt himself in
the use of the language. All endeavours therefore to
-make men Orators by describing to them in words the

D   ISGUISE   thyself as thou wilt, still SI.AVE.Y! still
thou art a bitter draught; and thoug'h tlhousands in
all a0oes have been macde to drink of thee, thou art no less
bitter on that account. It is thliou, LIBEPTY, thlirce sweet

herself shall change--no tint of wordds can spot thy snowy

great Bestower of it, and give ine but this fair godcdess as
my companion; and sho w-er down thy mitres, if it seems
good unto thy divine providence, upon those heads which
are aching for them.--
PURsuING these ideas, I sat down close by my table, and
leaning my head upon my hand, I;began to figure to myself
the miseries of confinement. I was in a rilght frame for it,
and so I gave full scope to my imagination.
I WAS going to begin with the millionis of mny fellowcreatures born to no inheritance tbut slavery; but finding-,
however a-ffe/&amp;in. the pidiure was, that I could not bring
it nearer me, arid that the m-wPultitude of sad Orcups in it
did but distra6l me.-.I-TOOKC  a single captiv.e andi having first shult him up
in his dungeon, I then loolked tihrough the twiiig lht of his
grated door to take his p3ilture.
I EHIEL D his body half wasted away with long expe&amp;tation
and confinement, and felt what kind of sicknecss of the heart
it was which arises from hope cieferrciied. Upon looking nearer
I saw him pale and feverish: in thirty years the western
breeze had not once fainned his blood--he llad seen no sun,
no moon in all that time--nor had the voice of friend or
kinsman breathed through his lattice.  His children
-BuT here my heart began to bleed-anid I was forced
to go on with another part of the portrait.
HF was sitting upon the ground upon a little straw, in the
furthest corner of his dungeon, which was alternately his
chair and bed: a little calendar of small sticks were laid at
the head, notched all over with the dismal days and nights,Book FVII.      DESCRIPTIVE        PIECES.          173
he had passed there--he had one of these little sticks in his
hand, and with a rusty nail he was etching another day of
misery to add to the heap. As I darkened the little light
he had, he lifted up a hopeless eye towards the door, ther
cast it down-shook his head, and went on with his work
of affli6tion. I heard his chains upon his legs, as he turned
his body to lay his little stick upon the bundle--He gave a
deep sigh-I saw the iron enter into his soul--  burst into
tears--I could not sustain the pieture of confinement which
my fancy had drawn.

THE COUNTRY CLERGYRMAN
EAR yonder copse, where once the garden smil'd,
And still where many a garden flower gro ws wild;'There, where a few torn shrubs the -place disclose,
The village preacher's modest mansion rose.
A main he was, to all the country dear,
And passing rich with forty pounds a year;
Remote from towns he ran his godly race,
Nor e'er had chang'd, nor wish'd to change his place;
Unpratis'd Ihe to fawn or seek for powelr,
By do&amp;trines fashion'd to the varying hour;
Far other aims his heart had learn'd to prize,
iMore skill'ci to raise the wretched than to rise.
Hlis house was known to all the vagrant train,.He chid their wanderings, but reliev'd their pain.
The long remiember'd beggar was his guest,
WVhose beard descending swept his aged breast;
The ruin'd spendthrift, now no longer proud,
Claim'd kindred there, and had his claims allow'dl;
The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay;
Sat by hlis fire, and talk'd the night away;
~Wept o'er his wounds, or tales of sorrow done,
Shoulder'd his crutch, and slhe-w'd how fields were wen.
Pleas'd with his guests, the good man learn'd to glow,
And quite forgot their vices in their woe;Careless their meIrits, or their faults to scan,
His pity gave ere charity began.
T}us to relieve the wretched was his pride,
And even his failings lean'd to virtue's side;
But in his duty prompt at every call,
He watch'd and wept, he felt and pray'd for all.
And, as a bird each fond endearment tries,
To tempt its new fledg'd offspring to the skies
He try'd each art, reprov'd each dull delay,
Allur'dl to brighter worlds, and led the way.
BESIDE the bed wvhere parting life was laid,
And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismay'd,
The reverend champion stood, at his coiitroul,
Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;
Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise
And his last falt'ring- accents whisper'd praise.
At church, with meek and unaffe&amp;eed grace,
His looks adorn'd the venerable place;
Truth from his lilps prevail'd with double sway,
And fools who came to scoff remain'd to pray.
The service past, around the pious man,
W~ith ready zeal each honest rustic ran;
E'en children follow'd with endearing wile,
And pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile,
HIis ready smile a parent's warmth exprest,
Their welfare pleas'd him, and their cares distrest;
To them his heart, his love, his grief'cS  were giv'n,
But all his serious thoughts had rest in heav'n.
As sonme tall cliff tl-hat lifts its awful form,
Swells from the vale and midway leav es the storm,-i
Tho' eotllnl its breast the rolling clouds aire spread,
Eternal sunshine settles on its head.

Over mead, and over wood,
From h6use to house, from hill to hill'Till contemplation had her fill.
ABOUT his chequer'd sides I wind
And leave his brooks and meads behind,
And groves and grottos where I lay,

While, ever and anon, there falls
Huge heaps of hoary moulder'd walls.
Yet time has been, that lifts the low,
And level lays the lofty brow,
Has seen this broken pile compleat,
Big with the vanity of state;
But transient is the smile of fate;

To instruEt our wandring thought;
Thus she dresses green and gay,

EVER charming, ever new,
WVhen will the landskip tire the view'
Smanner in which their voice, countenance, and hands are
to be employed, in expressing the passions, must, in my
apprehension, be weak and ineffedual. And, perhaps,
the only instrution which can be given with advantage
on this head, is this general one: Observe in what manner the several emotions or passions are expressed in real
life, or by those who have with great labour and taste acquired a power of imitating nature; and accustom your~
self either to follow the great- original itself, or the best
copies you meet with; always, however, "with this special observance, that you O'ERSTEP NOT THE MIODESTY
OF NATURE.'E
IN the application of these rules to pratice, in order to
acquire a just and graceful elocution, it will be necessary
to go through a regular course of exercise; beginning
with such as are most easy, and proceeding by slow steps
to such as are more difficult. In the choice of these, the
praaitioner should pay a particular' attention to his pre.
vailing defe&amp;s, whether they regard articulation, commniand of voice, emphasis, or cadence: and he should content himself with reading and speaking with an immediate
view to the correting of his fundamental faults, before he
aims at any thing higher. This may be irksome and disagreeable; it may require much patienhce and'resolution;.
but it is the only way to succeed. For, if a man cannot
read simple sentences, or plain narrative, or dida&amp;ic pieces, with distinll-t articulation, just emphasis, and proper
tones, how can he expe&amp; to do justice to the sublime descriptions of poetry, or the animated language of tlh
passions?
IN performing these exercises, the learner should daily
read aloud by himself, and, as often as he has opportuni.
ty, under the corre&amp;ion of an instru&amp;tor or friend. He
should also frequently recite compositions memoriter. This
method has several advantages: it obliges the speaker to
dwell upon the ideas which he is to express, and hereby
-enables him to discern their particular meaning and force,

IT were much to be wished, that all public speakers
would deliver their thoughts and sentiments, either from
memory or immediate conception; for, besides that there
is an artificial uniformity, which almost alw-ays distin-'guishes reading from speaking, the fixed posture, and the
bending of the head which reason requires, are inconsistent with the freedom, ease, and variety of just elocution.
But if this is too much to be expeEted, especially from
Preachers, who have so much to compose, and are so often called upon to speak in public; it is however extremely desirable that they should make themselves so well acquainted with their discourse, as to be able, with a single
glance of the eye, to take in several clauses, or the whole,of a sentence*.
I HAVE only to add, that after the utmost pains have
been taken to acquire a just elocution, and this with the
greatest success, there is some difficulty in carrying the
art of speaking out of the school, or chamber, to the bar,'the senate, or the pulpit. A young man who has beer,accustomed to perform frequent exercises in this art irx,private, cannot easily persuade himself, when he appears
before the public, to consider the business he has to per.,form in any other light, than as a trial of skill, and a dis..flay of oratory. Hence it is, that the charaater of am

times with contempt. We are pleased with the easy and

TWith all thy sober cheer display'd
To bless my longing sight;
Thy mien compos'd, thy even pace,
Thy meek regard, thy matron grace,
And chaste subdu'd delight.
No more by varying passions beat
O gently guide my pilgrim feet
To find thy hermit cell;
Where in some pure and equal sky
Beneath thy soft indulgent eyeThe modest virtues dwell.
Simplicity in Attic vest,
And Innocence with candid- breast,
And clear undaunted eye;
And Hope, who points to distant years,
Fair op'nipng thro' this vale of tears
A vista to the sky.
There Health, thro' whose calm bo-som glide
The temperate joys in even tide,

Andl Patience there, thy, sister meek,
Presents her mild, unvarying cheek.

Inur'd to toil and bitter bread,

In what brown hamlet (dost thou joy
To tell thy tender. tale;
The lowliest children on the ground,
Ml~oss-rose and violet blossom round),
And lily of the vale.
O say what soft propitious hour
I best may chuse to hail thy power,
TAnd court thy gentle sway?
When Autumn, friendly to the nluse,
Shall thy own modest tints diffuse,
And shed thy milder day.
WVhen Eve, her dewy star beneath,
Thy balmy spirit loves to breathe,
And every storm is laid;
If such an hour was e'er thy choice,'Oft let me hear thy soothing voice

the accomplished Barrister; and the sublime devotion,

the unskilful may gaze and applaud, the judicious cannot
but be grieved and disgusted. Avail yourself, then, of

And love the highl embowed roof,
With antique pillars massy proof,
And storied windows richly dight
Castiig a dim religious light.

TI-IE PROGRESS OF LIFE.
A LL the world's a stage,
X  Andt all the men and -women -erely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays mnany parts:
Ilis aas being seven ages. At first the infant,
MIewling acnd puking in the nurl'se's arms.
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel,
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with'a woeful ballad
MIade to his mistress' eye-browd. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bealrded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudlden and quick in quarrel;
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In faiir round belly, with good capon liln'd,
XNith eyes seere, and bearct of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and. modern instances,
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side;
His youthfull hose well sav'd, a world tsoo wide
For his shrunk shank; and. his big manly voicc,
Turning again toward chlildishl treble, pi pes,
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventfill history,Book Vy.       DESCRIPTIVE       PIECES.          209
Is second childishness, and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.

THE ENTRY OF BOLINGBROKE AND RICHARD
INTO LONDON.
DUKE AND DUo'Cu.ES OF rORK.
D)UTCH. M   PY Lord, you told me, you would tell the rest,. When weeping made you break the story off,
Of our two cousins coming into London.
-YoRKx Where did I leave?
DUTCH. At that sad stop, my Lord,
Where rude misgovern'd hands, from window-tops,
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.
YORK. Then, as I said, the Duke great Bolingbroke ~
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed,
Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,
W'ith slow, but stately pace, kept on his course;
While all tongues cried,- Go save thee, Bolingbroke ~
You would have thought the very windows spake,
So miany greedy looks of young and old
Through casements darted their desiring eyes
Upon his vis.ige; and that all the walls.
WVith painted imag'ry had said at once,
Jesus preserve thee  welcome Bolingbroke!
WVhilst he, from one side to the other turningy
Bare-headed, lower than his proud steed's neck,.
Bespoke them thus: I thank you countrymen;
And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along..
DuTchi. Alas! poor Richard, uwhere rides he the while 7
YoRK. As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
After a well-grac'd ac&amp;tor leaves the stage,
Are idly bent on him that enters next,
Thinking his prattle to be tedious:.
Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes,
Did scowl on Richard; no man cry'd, God save him t
No joyful ton,gue gave him his welcome home;
Bltt dust was thrown upon his sacred head;
Whi:h with such gentle sorrow he shook off,

For him thou labour'st by thy fliglht to shun,
And yet runn'st tow'rd him still. Thou art not noble;
For all th' accommodations that thou bear'st,
Are nurs'd by baseness; thou'rt by no means valiant;
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
And that thou oft provok'st; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which is no more.  Thou'rt not thyself;'For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains,
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
For what thou hast not, still thou striv'st to get;
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
For thy complexion shifts to strange effe&amp;s,

Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a jourlney,
And death unloadeth thee. Friend tIou hast none;
For thy own bowels, which do call thee sire'

Do curse the Gout, Serpigo, and the Rhoeumn,
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth lnor age

CLARENCE's DREAM.
CLARENCE AND BRAKRfB URr.
BItA. AW, FIY looks your Grace so heavily to-day?
CLAlu. 0, I have pass'd a miserable nilht,
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
That as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night,
Though'tvere to buy a world of happy days;
So full of dismal terror was the time.
BRAK. WVhat was your dream, my Lord? I pray you
tell me.
CLAR. Methought that I had broken from the tow'r
And was imbark'd to cross to Burgundy
And in my company my brother Glo'ster;
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches. Thence we look'd tow'rd England,
And cited up a thousand lheavy times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster,
That had befalln us. As we pass'd along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
iMethoug'ht that Glo'ster stumbled, and in falling
Struck me (that sought to stay him) overboard,
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
LORD, Lord, methought, what pain it wa.s to drown t
What dreadful noise of waters in my ears!
WVhat sights of ugly death within mine eyes!
I thought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks
A thousand men, that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels;
Some lay in dead men's sculls; and in those holes
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
As'twere in scorn of eyes, refle&amp;ing gems,.
That wvoo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
Ba AK. Had you such leisure in the time of de:ath,
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
CLAR. Methou~ght I had; and often did I strive
To yield the ghost; but dili tl~h~ enivious flood
Cha X 1IXl.kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
To find the emnpty, vast.. and wand'ring air;
But smother'd it wit hin myn panting bulk,
XVFhich almost burst to belch it in the sea.
BrA.:K. Awak'd you not with this sore agony?
CI AR No, 1o; my dream was lengthen'd after life  
O then lbegan the temnpest to my soul:
I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
Wiith-that grim ferryman  which poets write of,
JUnto the king-dom of perpetual night.
The fiirst that there did greet my stranger-soul,
WVas my great father-in-law reenowned WVarwick,
Vb1ho cry'd aloud -  What scolurg-e for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?"
And so he vanish'd. Then came wand'ring by
A shadctow like an angel, with bright hair
D abbled in blood, and he sh;iek'dc out aloud~ Clarence is come, fal se, fleeting, prejured Clarence,
T'Ihat stabb'd me irn the fieldl by Tjewksbury;
Seize on him, furies, take hiimn to your torments i"-'With that, melthoughte, a legion of foul fiends
Invirol'd me) and howled in -mine ears
Such hideous cries,- that with the very noise
I trembling walk'd; and for a season after
Could not believe but that'I was in theIl
Such terrible iniprec;sion omade my dream.
BR AX. No nmarvel, Lord, tat it it aii'ftighted you;
I aim afraid, rnethinks, to hear you tell it.
CLAR. Ah! Br akenbulry, I have dlone those things
That now give evidence against myrsoul,
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me  
O God! if my deep prayers c annot appease thiee,
But thou wilt be aveng'd on my 1m:isdeeds,
Yet execute thy wrath on'me alone:
O spare my guiltless w-ife, and my poor children i
I pr'y thee, Brakenbury, stay by me:
My soul is heavy, and I fairs would sleep.

In shape no bigger than an agate stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman;
[Drawn with a team of little atomies,
Athwart nmen's noses as they lie asleep:
Her wvaggon spokes made of long spinners' legs;
The cover of thle wings of grasshoppers;
The traces of the smnallest spider's web;'I'he collars of the moonshine's watery beams;
Her whlip of cricket's bone; the lash of film;
Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Nothalf so big as a round little worm,
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid.
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,
Made by the joiner squirrel, or old grub,
Time out of mind the fairies' coach-makers.
And in this state she gallops, night by night,
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love:
On courtiers' knees, t&amp;at dream on curtsies strait:
O'er lawyers' fingers, who strait dream on fees:
O'er ladies' lips, who strait on kisses dream;
Sometiines she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometimes comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,'J'ickling the parson as he lies asleep;
Then dreams he of another benefice.
Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
And then he dreamns of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Ofhealths five fathom deep? and then anon
Drulms in his ears, at which he, starts and wakes;
And beiing thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
And sleeps again.

Green earthen pots, bladders, and nmusty seeds,
Remnants of packthread, andc old cakes of roses

Noting this penury, to rnyself I said,
An' if a man did need poison now,
Whose sale is prcsent death in mantua,

Oh, this same thougtlt dlid but fore run my -need,
And this same needy man must sell it me.

Like thy own solemn springs,

Sits on yon western tent, whose cloudy- skirts
With breeze ethereal wove,
O'erhang his wavy bed:
Now air is hush'd, save where the veak eyed-bat,
With short shrill shrieks flits by on leathern wing.
Or where the beetle winds
TIis small but sullen horn,
As oft'he rises'midst the twilight path,
Against the pilgrim born in heedless hum,
Now teach me, maid compos'd,
To breath some softened strain,
Whose numbers stealing through thy dark'ning vale,
ltMay not unseemly with its stillness suit,
As musing slow I hail
Thy genial, lov'd return!
For when thy folding star arising shews
HIis paly circlet, as his warning lamp

Who slept in flow'rs the day,
And many a nymph who wireathes her brows with sedge,
And sheds the fresh'ning drew, and lovelier still,

Cheers the lone heath, or some time-bellowed pile,
Or up-lancl fallows grey

But when chill blust'ring winds, or driving rain,
Forbid my willing feet, be mine the hbut,
That from the mountain's side.
Views wilds, and swelling floods,
And hamlets brown, and dim-discover'd spires,
And hears their simple bell, and marks o'er all.

The gradual dusky veil.
Rhile spring shall pour his show'rs, as oft he wont,
And bathe thy breathing tresses meekest Eve!
While Summer loves to sport
Beneath thy ling'ring light;
While sailow Autumn fills thy lap with leaves;
Or Winter yelling through the troublous air,
Affrights thy shrinking train,
And rudely rends thy robes;
So long, sure-foundbeneath thy sylvan shed,
Shall Fancy, Friendship, Science, rose-lip'd Hea:lth,

DOMESTIC LOVE AND H-IPPINESS.
HAPPY they! the happiest of their kind i
Whom gentler stars unite, and in one fate
Their hearts, their fortunes, and their beings blend.'Tis not the coarser tie of human laws,
Unnatural oft, and foreign to the mincl,
That binds their peace, but harmony itself,
Attuning all their passions into love:
Where friendship full exerts her softest power.
Perfe:t esteem, enliven'd by desire
Ineffable, and sympathy of soul:
Thought meeting thought, and will preventing will,
With boundless confidence: for nought but love
Can answer love, and render bliss secure.
Let him, ungenerous, who alone, intent
To bless himself, from sordid parents buys
The loathing virgin, in eternal care,
WVell-merited, consume his nights and days:
Let barbarous nations, whose inhuman love
Is wild desire, fierce as the suns they feel;
I,et eastern tyrants from the light of fleaven
Seclude their bosom-slaves, meanly possess'd
Of a mere lifeless, -violatedl form:
While those whom love cements in holy faith,
And equal transport, free as nature live,
Disdaining fear. W~hat is the world to them,
Its pomp, its pleasure, and its nonsense all?
W~ho in each other clasp whatever fair
High fancy forms, and lavish hearts can wish;
Something than beauty dearer, should they look
Or on the mind, or mind-illumiin'd face:
Truith, goodness, honour. harmony and love)
The richest bounty of indulgent Heaven.
Mean-time a smiling offspring rises round,
And mingles both their graces. By degrees,
The human blossom blows; and every day,
Soft as it rolls along, shlews some new charm,
The father's lustre, and the mother's bloom.
Then infant reason grows apace, and calls
For tlhe kind hand of an assiduous care.

To pour the fresh instru.tion o'er the mind,'To breathe th' enlivening spirit, and to fix
The generous purpose in the glowing breast.
Oh speak the joy! ye whom ttle sudden tear
Surprizes often, while you look around,
And notlhing strikes your eye but sights of bliss;
All varioius Natyre pressing on the heart:
fAn elegant sufficiency, content,
Retirement, rural quiet, friendship, books,
Ease and alternate labour, useful life,
Progressive virttue, and approving Heaven.
These are the imatchless joys of virtuous love;
And thus their moments fly. The Seasons thus,
As ceaseless round a jarring world they roll,
Still find them happy; and consenting Spring
S-heds lier own rosy garland on their heads:
Till evening comes at last, serene and mild;
Whlwn after the long vernal day of life,
Enamour'd more, as more remembrance swells
With many a proof of recoll.e-ted love,
Together down they sink in social sleep;
Togeiler freed, their gentle spirits fly
To scenes where love and bliss immortal reign.

THE PLEASURES OF RETIREMENT.
O KNEW he but his happiness, of men

Deep in the vale, with a choice few retir'd,
Driinks the pure pleasures of the rural life.

Of flatterers false,. and in their turn abus'd!
Vile intercourse! WVhat tho' the glittering robe,
Of every hue refleaed light cr,t give,
Or floated loose, or stiff with nmazy gold,

Bleeds not, and his insatiate table heaps
WVith luxury, and death? What tho' his bowl

Flames not with costly juice; nor sunk in beds
Oft otf gay care, he tosses out the night,
Or melts the thoughtless hours in idle state'Vhat tho' he knows not those fantastic joys,
That still amuse the wanton, still deceive:;
A face of pleasure, but a heart of pain;
Their hollow moments undelighted all?
Sure peace is his; a solid life estrang'd
To disappointment, and fallacious hope:
Rich in content, in Nature's bounty rich,
In herbs and fruits; whatever greens tlle Spring,
~WThen heaven descends in shower;'or bends the bough'When Summer reddens, and when Autiumn   beamUs  
Or in the wint'ry glebe whatever lies
Conceal'd and fattens with the richest sap:
These are not wanting; nor the milky drove,
Luxuriant, spread o'er all thy lowing vale:
Nor bleating mountains; nor the chide of streaff-s,
And hium of bees, inviting sleep sincere
Into the guiltless breast, beneath the sh'ade,
Or thrown at large amid the fragrant'hay;
NTor aught besides of prospe6t,  grove, or song,
Dim grottoes, gleaming lakes, and fountain cleat.
Hiere too dwells simple truth; plain innocence  
TUnsullied beauty; sound unbroken youth,
Patient of labour, with a little pleas'd;
H-lealth ever blooming; unambitious toil;
Calm contemplation, and poetic ease.
THE rage of nations, and the crush of states,
/ove not the man, who, from'the woirld escap'd,
In still retreats, and flowery solitudes,
To Nature's voice attends, from month to month,

The golden zones of heav'n: to some she gave

THE STORY OF LE FEVRE.'T was some time in the summer of that year in which
De Denderrnond was taken bi the allies-w:hlich was about
seven years before my fathtr came into the country5- anld
about as many, after the timre, that my uncle Toby and
Trim had privately decanped fromn my father's house in
town, in order to lay some of tLe finest sieges to s_ome of the
finest fortified cities in Europe--when mny uncle''oby was
one eveninIg get:ing his supper, with Trim sitting behind him
at a smriall sideboard;----- The landlord of a little inn in the
village came into the parlour with_an empty phial in his hand
to beg a glass or two of sack; "is for:a poor gentleman,
-I think, of the army, s-,id the landlord, whlo has been
taken ill at mny house four days ago, and has never held up
his head since, or lhad a desire to taste any thing, till just
now, that he has a fancy for a glass of sack and a thin toast,
I think, says he, taking his hand firom his forehead,
it would co?mfort me----
---F   I could neither beg, borrow, or buy such- a thing,
-tcadcied the landlord,;-- I woutd almost steal it- lor the
poor gentleman, he is so ill.-.----  hope in God he will
still mend, continued he--we are all of us concerned for.him.
Tiou art a gcod-natured soul, I will answer for thee,
cried my uncle Toby; and thou shalt -drillk tl-he poor gentlyman's healt'h in a glass of s-ack thyse lf,-and take a coupie of botties with my service, and tell hiim he is heartily

THovGul I am persuaded, said my uncle Toby, as the
landlord shut the door. he is a very compassionate fellowTrim,-yet I caninot help entertaining a high opinion of
his guest too; there must be something more than common
in him, that in so short a time should win so much upon
the affed&amp;ions of Ihis host;-And of his whole family,
added the corporal, for they are all concerned for him,Step after him, said my uncle Toby,-do Trim,-and ask
if he knows his name.
- I HAVZ. quite forgot it, truly said the landlord, com.
ing back into the parlour with the corporal,--but I can
ask his son again:-Has he a son with him then? said
mny uncle Toby.--A  boy, replied the landlord, of about
-eleven or twelve years of age;-but the poor creature has
tasted almost as little as his father; he does nothing but
mourn and lament for him night and day:----fe has not
stirred froim the bed-side these two days.
x/lY uncle l'oby la,id down his knife and fo'rk, and thrus
his plate irom before hlim, as the landlord gave him the account; and Trim, without being ordered, took away without saying one word, and in afew minutes after brought
him his pipe and tobacco.

time we may depend upon it, Trim, for our comfort, said
my uncle Toby, that God Almighty is so good and just

done them in a red coat or a black one:- --.I hope not;

ten minutesl-he was lying in his bed with his head raised
upon his hand, with his elbow upon the pillow, and a
clean white cambric handkerchief besicle it:-The youth

YORICK's DEATH.
A   FEW   hours before Yorick breathed his last, Eugenius
stept in with an intent to take his last sight and last
farewel of him. Upon his drawing Yorick,s curtain, and
asking how he felt himself; Yorick looking up in his face,
took hold of his' hand,-and, after thanking him for the
many tokens of his friendship to him, for which, he saicl, if
it was -their fate to meet hereafter, he would thank him
again and again; he toldlhim, he was within a few hours
of giving his enemies the slip for ever.-I hope not, answered Eugenius, witlh tears trickling down his cheeks, andl
with the tenderest tone that ever man spoke,-I hope not,
Yorick, saidl he.-- Yorick replied, with a look up, and
gentle squeeze of Eugenius'a hand,-and that was all,-but
it cut Eugenius to the heart.--Come, come, Yorick? quoth
Eugenius, wiping his eyes, and summoning up the man
within him,-- my dear lad, be eomforted,-let not.all
thy spirits, and fortitude -forsake thee at this crisis when tliou.most w-antest. them;-who knows what resources are in
store, ancl what the power of God may yet do for thee?-.
Yorick laid-his hand upon his heart, and gently shooki    -' he'ad; for my part, continued Eugenius, crying bitter236          PATHETIC PIECES.                   C1iap.i1.
ly as he uttered the words,-- I declare I know not, Yorick,
how to part with thee, and woukld gladly flatter ipy hopes,
added Eugenius, cheering' up' his.voice, thdat there is still
enough left of thee to make a bishop,,-and that I may live
to see it--I beseech thee, Eugenius, quoth Yorick, takingoff his night-cap as well as he could- with his ileft hland- -
his right still being grasped close in that of EuLgeniusi--
l'beseech thee- to take a view of my:head.-I see nothingthat ails it, replied Eugenius. Then alas! my friend, said
Yorick, let me tell you, thlat it is- so bruised and mis-shapened with the blows which have been so unhandsomely
given me in the dark, that I might say with Sancho Panca,
that should I reco-ver, and " mitres there-upon be suffer" ed to rain down from heaven as thick as hail, not one of
" theml would fit it."-Yorick's last breath was hanging
upon his trembling lips ready to depart as he uttered this;'L--yet still it was- uttered with something -of a Ceirvantic:
tone;----and -as he spoke it, Eugenius could perceive a
stream of lambent fire lighted up for a moment in his eyes;
--faint piaure of those flashes of his spirit, which (as
Shakespear said of his ancestor) were wont to set the table
in a roar.
EUGENIUS was convinced from thlis th-at the heart of his
friticnd was broken;. he squeezed his. hand,  -ancd thfnwalked softly out of-the room, weeping as he waiked.. Yorick followed Eugenins -with his eyes to the door) --lhe
then closed tlem,--anct never opened them more.
HE lies bunried in a corner of his church-yard, under a
plainniarble slab, whith his friend Eugenius, by leave of
his executors, laid upon his grave, with no more than thesethree words of inscription, serving both for his epitaph and
elegy,
Alas, poor YORICK!
-TEN. times a day.has Yorick's ghost the consolation tohear his monumental inscription read over with such  a variety of paintive tones, as denote a.general: pity and esteem

Keen blows the wind, and piercing is the'cold I
Short is my passage to the friendly'tomb,
For I am poor and miserably old.
SHOULD I reveal the sources of m.y grief,
If soft humanity e'er touch'd your breast,
Your hands would not witholdl the kind relief,
And tears of Pity would not be represt.

Hide their diminish'd heads; to thee I call,

Till pride, and worse ambition threw me dowih

JUBA AND SYPHAX.
3UB SYPHAX, I joy to meet thee thus alone.
B   I have observ'd of late thy looks are fall'n,
O'ercast with gloomy cares and discontent;
Th'en tell me, Syphax, I conjure thee tell me,
What are tlle thoughts that knit thy brow in frowns,,
And turn thine eyes thus coldly on thy prince?
SYPH.'Tis not my talent to conceal my thoughts,
Or carry smiles and sunshine in my' face,',Vhen discontent sits heavy on my heart-:
I have not yet so much the Roman in me.
JUB. Why dost thou cast out such ungen'rous term[
Against the lords and sov'reigns of the world?
Dost thou not see mankind fall down before them,
Andcl own the force of their superior virtue?~,44       PATHETIC PIECES.                  Clap. VII.
Is there a nation in the wilds of Afric,
Amidst our barren rocks, and burning sands.,
That does not trembllle at the Romran name?
SYPH. Gods! vwhere's the,lorth that sets this people up
Above your own Numidia's tawny sons?
Do they with tougher sinews b)end the bow.
Or flies the jav'lin swifter to its mark,
Launch'd from the vigour of a Roman arm?
WVho like our ative African instruSls'The fiery steed, and traiis him to his hand?
Or guides in troops th' embattled elephant,
Loaded with war? These, these are arts, my prince,
In which your Zama does not stoop to Rome.
Ju Bi These all are virtues of a meaner rank.
rerfe6tions that are plac'd in bones and nerveO.
A Roman soul is bent on higher views:
To civilize the rude unpolish'd world,'To lay it under the restraint of laws:
To mak-e man mild, and sociable-to man;
tro cultivate the wild licentious savage
With wisdom, discipline, ahd lib'ral arts;
Th' embellishments of life: virtues like thes6e
Make human nature shine, reform the soul,
And break our fierce barbarians into men.
SYpir. Patience, just Heav'ns!-Excuse an old man'$
warmth.
VVhat are these wond'rous civilizing arts,
This Roman polish, and this smooth behaviour,
That render man thus tra&amp;abble and tame?
Are they not only to disguise our passions,.
To set our looks at variance with'our thoughts,
To check the starts and sallies of the soul,
And break off all its comrmerce with the tongue?
In short, to change us into other creatures,
Than what our nature and the gods design'd us?
Jun. To strike thee dumb: turn up thy eyes to Cato l
There may'st-thou see to what a godlike height
The Roman virtues lift up mortal man.
While good, and just, and anxious for hIiis friends,
I-le's still severely bent against himself;
Renouncing sleep, and rest, and food, and ease,
I-le strives with thirst and hunger, toil and heat:
Aind when his fortune sets before hirm allBook VII1.         PATHETIC PIECES.                  245
The pomps and pleasures that his soul can wish,
His rigid' vilrtue will accept of none.
SYPH. Believe me, prince, there's not a African
That traverses outr vast Numidian deserts
In quest of prey, and lives upon his bow,
But better pra&amp;tices these boasted virtues.
Coarse are his nzeals, the fortune of the chase,.
Anmidst the running stream he slakes his thirst,
Toils all the day, and'at th' approach of night
On the first friendly bank he throws hliim down,
Or rests his head upon a rock till morn:
T'hen rises fresh, pursues his wonted gamne,
Andl if the followving day he chance to find
A newr repast, or an untasted spring,
Blesses his stars, and thinks it luxury.
JUB. Thy prejudi-ces, Syphax, won't discern
W\Vhat virtues grow from ignorance and choice2,
Nor how the'hero differs from the brute.
But grant that others couldl with equal glory
Look down on pleasures, and the baits of sense;
W,Vlher shall we find the 111man that bears afflition,
Great andc majestic in his griefs, like Cato;?
Hleav'ns i with what strength, what steadiness of mind,,
Ile triumphs in the midst of all'his suff'rings!
llow does he rise against a load of woes,
And- thiank the gods that threw the weight upon him i
SYPH.'Tis pride, rank pride, and haughltiness of soul a
I think the Romans call it stoicismn,
Had not your royal father thouglht so highly
Of Roman virtue, and of Cato's cause,
He ha(l not fall'n by a slave's hand, inglorious:
Nor would his slughter'd army now have lain
On Afric sands disfigur'd with their wounds,
To gorge tile wolves and vultures of Numidia.

You long to call him father. Marcia's charms'%Vork in your heart unseen, and plead for.Cato.
No wonder you are deaf to all I say.
JUB. Syphax, your zeal becomes importunate;
I've hitherto permitted it to rave,
And talk at large; but learn to keep it in,
Lest it should take more freedom than I'll give i.
SYPH. Sir, your great father never us'd me thus.
Alas, he's dead! but can you e'er forget
T'he tender sorrows and the pangs of naturey
T'he fond embraces, and repeatdd blessings,
\Vhich you drew from him in vour last farewell

At once to torture, and to please my soul.

SYPr. Fly from the fate that follows Casar's foebs.

SYPn. Believe me, prince, tho' hard to conquer lovey'Tis. easy to divert and break its force:
Absence might cure it, or a second mistress
Light up another flame, and put out this.
The glowing dames of Z:nma's royal court
tHave- fazes flush'd with more exalted charms;
The sun that rolls his chariot o'er their heads,
WVorks up more fire and colour in their cheeks:
Were you with these, my prince, you'd soon forget
The pale, unripen'dl beauties of the North.
JUB.'Tis not a set of features, or complexions
The tintaure of a skin that I admire.
Beauty soon grows familiar to the lover,
Fades in his eye, and palls upon the sense.

True, she is fair (Oh, how divinely fairl!)
But still the lovely maid improves her charms),

CATO's SOLILOQUY.
TT must be so-Plato, thou reason'st wellElse whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,
This longing after immortality?  
Or whence this secret dread, and inward horror,
Of falling into nought? Why shrinks the soul
Back on herself, and startles at destruCtion?'Tis the Divinity that stirs within us'Tis Heav'n itself that points out an hereafter,
And intimates eternity to man.
Eternity! thou pleasing, dreadful, thought!'rhro' what variety of untry'd being,
Thro' what new scenes and changes mulst we pass!
The wide th' unbounded prospeet lies before me;
3But shadowsj clouds, and darkness, rest upon it.Here will I hold. If tlhere's a pow'r above us,
(And that there is, all Nature cries aloud
Thro' all her wor-ks) he must delight in virtue;
And that which lie delights in, must be happy.
But when? or where r?--This world was made for Caesar,
I'm weary of conje&amp;tures-this must end'em.
T,us am I cldoubly arm'd.-My'death and life,.
My bane and antidote, are botlh befor'e me.
This in a rmoment brings mie to an end;
But this iDnforms me I shall never die.
The soul, seeur'd in lier existenne, smiles
At the dirawn dagger, and defies its point:
The stars shaid fade away, tle sun hlimself
Grow dim with age, and nature sink in years;
But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth,
Unhurit anmidst the war of elements,
The wreck:of miatter, and the cursh of worlds.

Are now the fruits; Disgrace -and infamy;
ily spotless name, which never yet the breath
Of calumny had tainted, made the mock
For foreign fools to carp at; but'tis fit

EDw. I thought, my lord, I had full well repay'd
Your services with lhonours, wealth, and pow'r

Guided in secret ev'ry latent wheel
Of government, and mov'd the Whole machine:

This wretched country, doom'd, perhaps' like Rome,
To fall by its own self destroying hand,

Wlhich you no ionger want; but know, proud youth,

Pays ev'ry debt, and cancels obligation.

Nor see I ought so god-like in the form,
So all-commanding in the name of Warwick,
That he alone should revel in the charms
Of beauty, and monopolize perfeEtion;

WAR. By Heav'n'tis false!
You knew it all, and meanly took occasion,
Whilst I was busy'd in tlw noble office
Your grace thought fit to honour me withal,
To tamper with a Weak unguarded woman,
To bribe her passions high, and basely steal
A treasure which your kingdom could not purchaseq.
EDW. How know you that? But be it as it may,
I had a right, nor will I tamely yield
My claim to happiness, the privilege
To choose the partner of my throne and bed;
It is a branch of my prerogative.
WAR. Prerogative! what's that? the boast of tyrants;
A borrow'd jewel, glitt'ring in the crown
With specious lustre, lent but to betray,
You had it, Sir, and hold it-from the people.

THERE is an heroic innocence, as well as an heroic courage.
THERE iS a mean in all things. Even virtue itself hath its
stated limits; which not being strialy observed, it ceases to
be virtue.
IT is wiser to prevent a quarrel beforehand, than to reernge it afterwards.
IT is much better to reprove, than to be angry secretly.
No revenge is more heroic, than that which torments envy,

The course of it so far, Flhere is your crown:
And he that wears the crown of iinmortality,
Long guard it your's! If I affect it more,'Ttlan as your honour, and as your renown,
Let me no more from this obedience rise,
TWhich- my most true and inward-duteous spirit
Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending.
Heav'n witness with me, when I here came in,
And found no course of breath within your Majesty,
How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,
O let me in my present wildness die,
And never live to shewiY th' incredulous world
The noble change that I have purposed.
Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,
(And dead almost, my Liege, to think you were)
I spake unto the crown, as having sense,
And thus upbraided it. T'he care on thee depending
Hath fed upon the body of my father,
Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold;
Other less fine in carat is more precious,
Preserving life in med'cine portable;
But thou, most fine, most honour'd, most rcnown'd,
lHast eat thy bearer up. Thus, Royal Liege,
Accusing it, I put it on my head,
To try with it (as with an enemy,
That had before my face murder'd my father)
T'he quarrel of a true inheritor.
But if it did infedt my blood with joy,
Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride,
If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
Did with the least affection of a welcome
Give entertainment to the might of it:
Let Heav'n for ever keep it from my head,
And make me as the poorest vassal is,
That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!
K. HENRY. 0 my son!
Heav'n put in thy mind to take it hence,
That thou might'st win the more thy father's love9
Pleading so wisely in excuse of it.
Come hither, Harry sit thou by my bed;
And hear, I think, the verv latest counsel'1-That ever I shall breathe. Heav'n knows, my son,
By what bye-paths, and indireEt crook'd ways
i met this crown; and I myself know well,

HIow troublesome it sat upon my head.
To thee it shall descend with better quiet,
Better opinion, better confirmation:
For all the soil of the atchievement goes'\ith me into the earth. - It seem'd in me
But as an honoul snatch'd with boist'rous hand,
And I hlad many living to upbraid
M%ly gain of it by their assistances;
Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,
Wounding supposed peace. All their bold feats,
Thou seest, with peril I have answer'd.
For all my reign hath been but as a scene
A6ting that argument: and now my death
Changes the mode: for what in me was purchas'd,
Falls upon thee in a much fairer sort;
For thou the garland wear'st successively.
Yet though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,
Trhou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;
And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,
Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;
By whose fell working I was first advanc'd,
And by whose power I well might lodge a fear,
To be again displac'd; which to avoid
I cut them off, and had a purpose now
To lead out many to the holy land;
Lest rest and lying still might make them look
Too near into my state. Therefore, mly Harry,
Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
With foreign quarrels; that ation, hence borne out,
May waste the memory of former days.
More would I, but mly lungs are wasted so,
That strength of speech is utterly deny'd me.
How I came to the crown, O God, forgive!
And grant it may with thee in true peace live!
P. HENRY, My gracious Liege,
You won it) wore it, kept it, gave it me;
Then plain and right must my possession be-;
Which I with more than with a common pain,'Gainst all, the world, willrightfuliy maintain.PATHETIC PIECES.

LIENRY V. TO HIS SOLDIERS.
WtVHAT's he that wishes for more men from England?
My cousin Westimoreland? No, my fair cousin,
If we are mark'd to die, we are enow
To do our country loss; and if to live,
The fewer men, the greater share of honour
God's will! I pray thee wish not one man more.
By jove, I am not covetous of gold;
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
But if it be a sin to covet lhonour,
I am the most offending soul alive.
No,'faith, my L,ord, wish not a man from England  
God's peace, I would not lose so great an honour,
As one man more, imethinks, would share from me,
For the best hopes I have. Don't wish one more:
Rather proclaim it (Westmoreland) through my host,
Thliat he which hath no stomach to this fight,
Let him depart; his passport shall be made,
And crows for convoy put into his purse:
WVe would not die in that man's company,
That fears his fellovship to die with us.
THis day is call'd the feast of Crispian:
He ti-at outlives this day, and comes safe home,
Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd,
And rouse him at the name of Crispian:
He that outlives this day, and sees old age,
xWill yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
And say, To-morrow is Saint Crispian:
Then mill he strip his sleeve, arnd shewv his scars.
Old men forget; yet shall not all forget,
But they'll remember, with advantages,
The feats they did that day. Then shall our nanmes,
Familiar in their mouth as houshold-words,
Harry the King, Bedford, and Exeter,
Warwick and Talbot,, Salisbury and Glo'ster,
Be in their flowing cups frteshly remember'd.

WOLSEY AND CROMWELL.
WVOL-.  AREWEL, along farewel to all my greatness!
This is the state of man: To-day he puts forth
The tender leaves of hope; to-morrow blossoms,
And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
His gret-tness is a-ripening, nips his shoot;
And then he f.lls, as I do- I have ventur'd,
Like little wanton boys, that swim on bladders,
These many summers in a sea of glory;
But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
At length broke under me; and now has left me,
Weary, and old with service, to the mercy
Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
Vain pomp and glory af the world, I hate ye!
I feel my heart new open'd. Oh, how wretched
Is that poor mall that hangs on princes' favours!
There is, betwixt that smile he would aspire to,
That sweet aspecq of princGes, and his ruin,
More pangs and fears than war or women have;
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
Never to hope again.'Why, how now, Cromwell?

A great man should decline-? Nay, if you weep2

ITH OUT a friend the world is but a wilderness.
A MAN may have a thousand intimate acquaintances,
and not a friend among them all. If you have one friend, think
yourself happy.
WHVHEN once you profess yourselfa friend, endeavour to be
always such. He cani never have any true friends) that will
be often changin- them.
PROSPERITY gains friends, and adversity tries them.
NTOTHING more engagesthe affetions of men, than a handsome address, and graceful conversaticn.
COMPLAISANCE renders a superior amiable) an equal agree-.1ble, and an inferior acceptable.
Exc E ss of ceremony shews want ofbreeding. That civility.i, best, which excludes all superfluous formality.
INGRATITUDE is a crime so shanieful, that the mnan was
mever yet found, who would acknowledge hinmself guilty of it.
TRUTH is born with us; and we must do violence to nature,
to shake off our veracity.
TIIERE cannot be a greater treachery, than first to raise
a confidence, and then deceive it.
BY others faults, wise men correct their own.
No man hath a thorough taste of prosperity, to whom adversity never happened.
WHEN our vices leave us, we flatter ourselves tllat we
leave thenm.

discover knowledge.

BODY.
FRIENDS, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears?.
I come to bury Cxsar, not to praise him.
T'he evil that men do lives after them.;'The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Casar? Noble Brutus
Hath told you, Cazsar was ambitious;
If it -were so, it was a grievous fault;
And grievously hath Cazsar anlswe;'d it.
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest,
(For Brutus is an honourable man,
So are they all, all honourable mnen)
Come I to speak in C xsar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me;
But Brututs says, he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
He hath brought many captives home t,o Rome,
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill;
Did this in Caesar seeml ambiti'ous,?
When that the poor have cry'd, Cwesar hath wept;
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff,
Yet Brutus is an honoirtible man.
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal,
I'thrice presented him a kingly crown;
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition
Yet Brutus says, he Nwas ambitious;
And, sure, he is anihonourable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,But here I am to speak what I do know,
You all did love him once, not withlout cause.
What cause with-holds you then to mourn for him?

Ant' men have'lost their reason.-Bear with me.My heart is in the coffin there with Czsar,
And I must pause till it come back to mle.
IF you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this inalPtle; I remember,
The first time ever Cesar put it on,'Twas on a sunlmer's evening in his tent,
That day he overcamne the Nervii  
Look! in this place ran Cassius' dagger through;--
See what a rent the envious Casca made,ThrougTh this the well-beloved Bruftus stabb'd;
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel awav,
Mark lhow the blood of Cxsar follow'd it!
As ruslinrg oiut of doors, to be resolv'd,
If BIrutus so unkindly knocA'd, or no:
For Brutus, as you know, was Casar's angel,
Judge, oh ye gods [ how dearly Cxzsr lov'd him;
This, this was the unkindest cutt of all
For when the noble Czesar saw him stab)
Ingratitude, more strong iithan traitors' arms,
Quite vanquish'd him; tlhen 1urst hnis mighty hleart:
And, in his mantle nrmffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pomnpey's statue,
7,Vhich all the whliie ran biood, great Casar fell.
Oh what a fall wxas there rnx counni' men
Then I anjd you, and all of us uf's 1 td!i.i'lhilst bloody treason fiourisli'd over us.

And v, ill, no doubt? witl: reason answer y1ou.
I come not, frienlds, to steal away your hearts;
I a? no orator, as Brutus is:
Bu.t, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
That loves mr' friend: and that they know full weU
That gave me public leavc to speak of himn:For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
A&amp;ion nor utt'rance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood; I only speak iright on:
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
Slhew you sweet Czesar's wounds, poor, poor dumb mouths!
And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, therie were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue
In eveiry wound of Czsar, that should move

THE QUARREL OF BRUTUS AND CASSIUS.
CA*s  r~    IIA'T you have wrong'd me doth appear in this,:
You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella,,
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
Wherein my letter (praying on his side,
Because I knew the man) was slighted of.
BRu. You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.
CAS. In such a time as tihis, it is not meet
That ev'ry nice offence should bear its comment.
BRU. Yet let me tell ou, Cas3sius, you yourself
Are much condemned to have an itching palm,
To sell and mart your offices for gold,
To undleservers.
CAS. I an itching palmn?
You know, that you are Brutus that spake this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
Bau. The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
And chastisement doth tllerefore hide its head.
CAS. Chastisement!--
BRU. Remember March, the ides of March remember l
Did not great Julius bleed for justice sake?
What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
And not for justice? What, shall one of us,
That struck the foremost man of all this world,
But for supporting robbers; shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes?
And sell the mighty meed of our large honours

Bau. You have done what you should be sorry for,
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats;
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty,.That they pass by me, as the idle wind,
Which I respeEt not. I did send to you
For certain sums of gold, which you deny'd me;
For I ca&amp;n raise no money by vile means:
By heav'n, I had rather coin my heart,
And drop my blood for drachmnas, than to wring
Fioom the hated hands of peasants their vile trash,
By any indireaion. I did send
To you for gold to pay my legions,
Which you denied me; was that done like Cassius?
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
When i Larcus Brutus grows so covetous,
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,
Dash him to pieces.
CAs. I deny'd you not.
Bau. You did.
CAs. I did not--he was but a fool
That brought my answer back.-Brutus hath rived my hearta
A friend should bear a friendcl's infirmities,

ANsGER may glance into the breast of a wise man,but rests
only in the bosom of fools.
NONE more impatiently suffer injuries, than those that are
most forward in doing them.
BY taking revenge, a man is but even with his enemy; but
in passing it over, he is superior,
T'o err is human; to forgive, divine,
A MORE glorious viaory cannot be gained over, another
man, than this, that when the injury began on his part) tie
kindness should begin on ours.
THE. prodigal robs his heir, the miser robs himself.
WTE should take a prudent care for the future, but so as to -

To mourn without measure is folly; not to mourn at al!

THOUGH a man may become learnedl by anotlher's learning; he never can be wise but by his own wisdom.
HE who wants good sense, is unhappy in having learning,
for he has thereby more ways of exposing himself.
IT is ungenerous to give a man occasion to blush at hit
own ignorance in one thing, who perhaps may excel us inI

No obje6 is more pleasing to the eye, than the sight of a

THE coin that is most current among mankindis flattery;
the only benefit of which is, that by hearing what we are nobt
we may be instructed what we ought to be.
THE charaaer of the person who comiends you, is to be
considered before you set a value on his esteem. The wise
man applauds him whom -he thinks most virtuous, there.st'of the world him who is most wealthy.
THE temperate man's pleasures are durable, because they
are regular; and all his life is calm and serene, because it
is innocent.
A GOOD man will love himself too well to lose, and his

OTHELLO AND IAGO.
IAGO. MY noble Lord,
OTH. What dost thou say, Iago?
IAGo. Did Mlichael Cassio, when you woo'd my Lady,
Know of your love?
OTH. He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask!IAGO. But for a satisfa&amp;tion of my thought,
NKo farther harm.
OTH. Why of tly thought, Iago?
IAGo. I did not think he'd been acquainted with it.
OTH. Oh1 yes, and went between us very oft.
IAGO. Indeed!
OTH. Indeed! ay, indeed. Discern'st thou aught ill that  
Is he not honest?  
IAGo. Honest, my Lord?
OTH. Honest? aye, honest.
IAGO. My Lord, for aught I know.
OTH. What dost thou think?
IAGO. Think, my Lord!OTH. Think,, my Lord! Why by Heav'n, thou echot;
me,
As if there were some monster in thy thought,
Too hideous to be shewn. Thou dost mean something:
I heard thee say but now, " thou lik'st not that,"When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?
And when I told thee, he was of my counsel,
In my whole course of wooing; thou cry'd'st, c Indeed I"
And didst contrae&amp; and purse thy brow together,
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,
Shew me thy thought.
IAGO. My Lord, you know I love you.
OTH. I think thou dost:
And, for I know, thou art full of love and honesty,
And weii'st' thy words before thou giv'st them breath,284       PATHIETIC PIECES.              COap. XXa  IL
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
For such things, in a false disloyal knave,
Are tricks of custom; but in a man that's just,
They're cold dilations working from the heart,
That passion cannot rule.
IAGO. For Michil Cassio,
I dare be sworn, I think, that he is honest.
OTH. I think so too.
IAGO. Men shiuld be what they seem;
Or, those that be not, would they might seem knave.s
OTH. Certain! men should be what they seem.
IAGO. TWhy, then -I think-Cassio's an honest man.
OTH. Nay'yet there's more in this;
I pray thee speak to me as to thy thinkings,
As thou dost ruminate: and give thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words.
IAGO. Good my Lord, pardon mre.
Though I am bound to every a6t of duty,
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to;
Utter my thoughts!-Why, say, tlhey're vile and false -
As where's that palace, whlereinto fcul things
Sometimes intrude not: tWho has la breast so' pure,
But some uncleanly apprehensions
Keeps leets and law-days, and in sessions sit
Wi th meditations lawful?  
OTH. Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
If thou but think'st him wrong'd, and mak'st his ear
A stranger to thy thoughts.
IAGO. I do beseech you,
Think I, perchance, am vicious in my guess,
(As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
To'spy into abuse; and oft my jealousy
Shapes faults that are not) I intreat you then,
From one that so imperfee&amp;ly conjedts,
Your wisdom would not build yourself a trouble
Out of my scattered and unsure observance:
It were not for your quiet, nor your good,
Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom,
To let you know my thoughts.

Is tile immediate jewel of their souls.'W~ho steals my purse, steals trash;'tis something, nothing;'Twas mine,'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
But he that filhes fiorm me nmy good name,
Robs me of that which not enriches him,
And makes me poor indeed.
OTH. I'll know thy thoughtsIAGO. You cannot,, if my heart were in your hand;
Nor shall not, whilst'tis in my custody.
OTH. Ha!
IAGo. Oh, beware, my Lord, of jealousy:
It is a green ey'd monster, which doth mock
The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss,
WTho certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
But oh, what damned minutes tells he o'er,'Who doats, yet doubts; suspeAts, yet strongly loves'
OTH. O misery!
IAGO. Poor and content, is rich and rich enough';
But riches endless, is as poor'as winter,
Tlo him tiat ever fears he shall be poor.
Good Heaven! the souls of all my tribe defend
Fromn jealousy i
OTrR. Why, why is this?
Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy?
To follow still the changes of the moon
With firesh suspicions?--'Tis not to make me jealous,
To say, my wife is fair, feeds well loves company,
Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well
VWhere virtue is, these make more virtuous.
Nor fromn mine own weak merits will I draw
The smallest fear, or doubt of her revolt,
For she,had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago
I'll see, before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
And, on the proof, there is no more but this,
Away at once with love or jealousy.
IAGO. I'm glad of this; for now I shall have reason
To shew the love and duty that I bear you
WVith franker spirit. Therefore, as I'm bound,
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
Look to your wife, observe her well with Cassio  286       PATHETIC PIECES.              Cliap. XX VI,

Out of self-bounty be abus'd; look to't.
I know our counilty-dispositoin well;
In Venice they do let t-teav'n see the pranks
They dare notshew their husbands.

She lov'd hem n-most.

For too much loving' you.

HAMLET's SOLILOQUY ON DEATHI.e
O be, or not to be?-that is the question.-..
TWhether'tis noble in mind to suffer
The stings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them?--.To die,--to sleep.
No more: and by a sleep,, to say, we end
The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to;--'Tis consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die--to sleepTo sleep? perchance to dream!-.-ay, there,s the rub -
For in that sleep of death what dreams tnay come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coilg
Must give us pause.--There's the respe.t
That makes calamity of so long life:
For who would bear the whips and scorns of th' time,
Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pang's of despis'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes;
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin! Who would fardels bear,
To groan and sweat under a weary life;
But that the dread of something after death
(That undiscover'd country, from whose bourne
No traveller returns) puzzles the will;
And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does imake cowards of us all:
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;
And enterprises of great pith and moment,
Writh this regard their current turn awry,
And lose the name of adion.

AN angry man who suppresses his passions, thinks worse
than he speaks; and an angry man that will chide,
speaks worse than he thinks.
A GOOD word is an easy obligation; but not to speak ill
requires only our silence, which costs us nothing.
IT is to affetation the world owes its whole race of coxcombs. Nature in her wiole drama never drew such a part  
she has sometimes made a fool, but a coxcomb is always of
his own making.
IT is the infirmity of little minds to_ be taken witlh every
appearance, and dazzled with every thing that sparkles; but
great minds have but little admiration, because few things appear new to them.
IT happens to men of learning, as to ears of corn; they
shoot up, and raise their heads high, while they are empty;
but when full, and swelled with grain, they begin to flag and
droop.
HzE that is truly polite, knows how to contradiat with
respeA, and to please without adulation; and is equally reinote from an insipid complaisance, and a low familiarity.
THE failings of good men are commonly more published
in the world than their good deeds; and one fault of a deserving man, shall meet with more reproaches, than all his
virtues, praise-: such is the force of ill will, and ill nature.
IT is harder to avoid censure, than to gain applause; for
this may be done by one great or wise a6tion in an age; but
to escape censure, a man-must pass his whole life without
saying or doing one ill or foolish thing.
-WHEN Darius offered Alexander ten thousand talents to
divide Asia equally with him, he answered, the earth cannot
bear two suns, nor Asia two kings. Parmenio, a friend of
Alexander's hearing the great offers Darius had made, said,
were I Alexander I would accept them. So would I, replied Alexander, were I Parmenio.
NOBILITY is to be considered only as an imaginary distinaion, unless accompanied with the pra6tice of those generous virtues by which it ought to be obtained. Titles of
honor conferred upon such as have no personal merit, are at
best but the royal stamp set upon base metal.
THOUGH an honourable title may be conveyed to posterity,
yet the ennobling qualities which are the soul of greatness,

SOLILOQUY OF THE KING          IN HAMLET.
-IH! my offence is rank, it smells to heav'n,
It hath the primal, eldest curse upon't;
A brother's murder----Pray I cannot:
Though inclination be as sharp as'twill,
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
And like a man to double business bound,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
And both negleit. What if this cursed hand
Were thicktr than itself with brother's bloodl?
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heav'ns
To wash it white as snow.? W'hereto serves mercvr.But to confront the visage of offince?,And what's in prayer, but this two-fold force,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
Or pardon'd being down!-  Then 1,ll look up;
My faults is past.-- But oh, what form of prayer
Can serve thy turn? Forgive me my foul murder!_
That cannot be, since I am still possess'd
Of those effects for which I did the mnurder,
My crow-n, mine own ambition, and my Queen,
May one be pardon'd, and retain th' offence  
In the corrupted currents of this world,
Offence's gilded hand m'ly shove by justice;
And oft'tis seen, the wicked prize itself
Buys out the laws. But'tis not so above.
There is no shuffling; there the a2ion lies
In its true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
Erv'n to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
To give in evidence. WVhat then? what rests -
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?
Oh wretched state! oh bosonz black as deatl!
Oh timed soul, that, struggling -to be free,
Art more engag'd! Hielp, angels! make assay I
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart, with strings of steel,
Be soft as sinews of the nlew-born babe

ODE ON ST. CECILIA's DAY.
DESCEND, ye Nine! descend and sing;
The breathing instruments inspire,
Wake into voice each silent string,
And sweep the sounding lyre!
To a sadly-pleasing strain
Let the warbling lute complain:
Let the loud trumpet sound,
Till the roofs all around
The shrill echoes rebound:
While in more lengthen'd notes and flow,
The deep, majestic, solemn organs blow,
Hark! the numbers soft and clear,
Gently steal upon the air;
Now louder and yet louder rise,
And fill with spreading sounds the skies;
Exalting in triumph now swell the bold notes,
In broken air, trembling, the wild music floats;'Till by degrees, remote and small,
The strains decay,
And melt away
In a dying, dying fall.
Br music, minds an equal temper know,
Nor swell too ligh, nor sink too low,
If in the breast tumultuous joys arise,
Music her soft, assuasive voice applies;
Or when the soul is press'd with cares,
Exalts her in enlivening airs,
57tarriors she fires with animated soulnds:
Pours balm into bleeding lovers wounds:
Melancholy lifts her head,
Morpheus rouses from his bed,
Sloth unfolds her arms and wakes,
List'ning Envy drops her snakes;
Intestine war no more our Passions wage,
And giddy Fa&amp;tions hear away their rage.
BUT when our country's cause provokes to arms,
How martial music every bosom warms!
So when the first bold vessel dar'd the seas,
High on the stern the Thracian rais'd his strain,

every one is ready to venture their lives and limbs in the
dispute; but when that is once at an end, it is no more
thought on, but sleeps in oblivion, buried in rubbish, which
no one thinks it worth his pains to rake into, much less to
remove.
HONOUR is but a fitious kind of honesty; a mean, but a
necessary substitute for it, in societies who have none: it is a
sort of paper-credit, with which men are obliged to trade,
who are deficient in the sterling cash of true morality and
religion.
PERSONS of great delicacy should know the certainty of
the following truth: there are abundlance of cases which
occasion suspense, in which whatever they determine they
will repent of the determination; and this throuLgh a propensity of human nature to fancy happiness in those schemes
which it does not pursue.
THE chief advantage that ancient writers can boast over
modern ones seems owing to simplicity. Everv noble truth
and sentiment was expressed by the former in a natural manner, in word and phrase simple, perspicuous, and incapable
of improvement. What then remained, for later writers,
but affeeation, witticism) and conceit?

THE DERVISE.
DERVISE, travelling thro' Tartary, being arilved at the
town of Balk, went into the king's palace by a mistake,
as thinking it to be a public inn or caravansary. Having looked about him for some time, he entered into a long gallery,
where he laid down his wallet, and spread his carpet, in order to repose himself upon it after the nlanner of the eastern
nations. He had not 6een long in this posture, before he was
discovered by some,of the guards, who asked him what was
his business in that place? The Dervise told them he intended
totake up his night's lodging in that caravansary. The guards
lethim know, in a very angry man.ne-r that the house he was in
was not a caravansary, but the king's-palace. It happened that
the king himself passed through thle gallery during this debate, and smiling at the mistake of:tie Dervise, asked him how
he could possibly be so dull as-not to distifiguish a palace from
a caravansary? Sir, says the Dervise, give nle leave to ask
your majesty a question or two. Vllo were the persons
that lodged in this houlse when it was first built? The king
replied, his ancestors. And who, says the Dervise, was the
last person that lodged here? The king replied, his father.
And who is it, says the Dervise, that lodges here at present?
The king told him, That it was he himself. And who, says
the Dervise, will be here after you? The king answered,
The young prince his son.' Ahb Sir,' said the Dervise,'a house that changes its inhabitants so often, and receives

TURKIS;H     TALE.
Wi   E are told that the Sultan Mahmoud, by his perpetual
~  wars abroad, and his tyranny at home, had filled his
dominions with rui-n and desolation, and half unpeopled the
Persian Empire. The visier to this great Sultan (whether
an humorist or an enthusiast, we are not informed) pretended to have learned of a certain Dervise to understand the
language of birds, so that there was not a bird that could
open his mouth, but the visier knew what it was he said.
As he was one evening with the -emperor, in their return
from huinting, they saw a couple of owls upon a tree that grew
near an old wall out of a heap of rubish.. I would fain know,
says the sultan, what those two owls are saying to one another; listen to their discourse and give me an account of
it. The visier approached the tree, pretending to be very
attentive to the two owls. Upon his return to the Sultan,
Sir, says he, I have heard part of their conversation,
but dare --not tell you what it -is. The Sultan would not be
satisfied with such an answer, but forced him to repeat
word for word every thing the owls had said. You must
know then, said the visier, that one of these owls has a
on, and the other a daughter, between whom they are now
upon- a- treaty ofmarriage.-- The fatth-er of the son said to
the father. of the-daughter, in my hearing, brother, I con.
sent to this mnariage, provided you will settle upon your
daughter fifty ruin'd villages for her portion. To which
the father of the daughter -replied, instead of fifty I will
give her five hundred, if you please. God grant a long
life to Sultan Mahmoud; whilst he reigns over us, we shall
never want ruined villages.
Tae story says, the Sultan was -so touched with the -fable,- that he rebuilt the towns and villages which had been
destroyed, and from that time forward consulted the good
of his people.                                 Spectator.

AVARICE     AND    LUXURY.
T   HERE-were two very powerful tyrants engaged in n
perpetual war against each other: the name of the16         NARRATIVE PIECES.                    Boo,k 1.first was Luxury, and of the second Avarice.'The aim of
each of them was. no less than universal monarchy over the
hearts of mankind. Luxury had many generals under him,
who did him great service, as Pleasure, Mirth, Pomp, and
Fashion. Avarice was likewise very strong in his officers,
being faithfully served by Hunger, Industry, Care and
Watchfulness: he had likewise a privy-counsellor who was
always at his elbow, and whispering something or other inhis ear: the name of this privy-counsellor was Poverty.
As Avarice conducted himself by the counsels of Poverty,
his antagonist was entirely guided by the dictates and advice
of Plenty, who was his first counsellor and minister of state,
that concerted all his measures for him, and never departed out of his sight. While these two great rivals were thus
contending for empire, their conquest were very various.
Luxury got possession of one heart, and Avarice of another.
The father of a family would often range himself under
the banners of Avarice, and the son under those of Luxury.
The WVi'fe and Husband would often declare themselves on
the two different parties; nay, the same person could very
often side with one in his youth, and revolt to the other in
his old age. Indeed the wise men of the worid stood neu=
ter; but alas, their numbers were not considerable. At length
when these two potentates had wearied themselves with
waging. war upon one another, they agreed upon an inter~isew, at which neither of their counsellors were to be present. It is said that Luxury began the parley, aind after hav--
ing represented the endless state of war in which they
were engaged, told his enemy, with a frankness of heart
wvhich is natural to him, that he believed they two should
he very good friends were it net for the instigations of.Poverty, that pernicious counsellor, who made an ill use of
his ear, and filled him with groundless apprehensions and
prejudices. To this Avarice replied, that he looked upon.
Plenty (the first rminister of his antagonist) to be a. much
mnore destruetive counsellor than-Poverty, for that he was
perpetually suggestinag pliasur's, bannishing all the necessary ca.utions against want, and consequently undermining
those principles on which the government of Avarice was
founded. At last, in order to an accommodation, they
agreed upon this preliiminary, that each' of themn sho uld
immediately dismiss his privy-counsellor. When things
were "thus far- adjusted towards a'eadce, all' other differ;ences
were soon acceoimmodated; insomuch that,t for the futuretCha. I,      NARRATIVE PIECES,                  17
they resolved-to live as good friends and confederateS, and
to share between them  whatever conquest were made on
either side. For this reason we now find Luxury and
Avarice taking possession of the same heart, and divid.
in" the same person between them. To which I shall
only add, that since the discarding of the counsellors abovementioned, Avarice supplies Luxury in the room of Plenty,
as Luxury prompts Avarice in the place of Poverty.

PLEASURE      AND    PAIN.
T   HIERE were two families which from the beginning of: the world were as opposite to each other as -light and
darkness. The one of them lived in heaven, and the other
in hell. The youngest descendant of the first family was
Pleasure, who was the daughter of Happiness, who was
the child of Virtue, who was the offspring of the Gods.
These, as I said before, had their habitation in heaven.
The youngest of the opposite family was Pain, who- was the
son of Misery, who was the child of Vice, who was the
offspring of the Furies. The habitation of this race of
beings was in hell.
THE middle station of nature between these two opposite
extremes was the earth, which was inhabited by creatures
of a middle k-ind, neither so virtuous as the -one, nor so
vicious as the other, but partaking. of. th-e good and bad
qualiti.es of these two opposite famuilies. Jupiter considering that this species commonly called man, was too virtuous:to be miserable, and too vicious to be happy; that he
might make a distintion between the -good and the:bad,
oirdered the two youngest of the above-mentioned families,.
Pleasure who was the daughter of Happiness, and Pain
who was the son of Misery, to meet one another upon this
part of nature which lay in the half way between them,
having promised to settle it upon them both, provided they:could agree upon the division of it, so as to share mankind:between them.  
PLEAsSURE and PAIN were no sooner met in their new'habitation, but they immediately agreed upon this point,
that-Pleasure -should take possession of the virtuous, and
D 2.Pain of the vicious part of that species which was given
up to them.' But upon examining to which of them  anly
individual they met with belonged, they found each of
them had a right to him'; for that, contrary to what they
had seen in their old places of residence, there was no
person so vicious who h,ad not some  good in him, nor
any person so virtuous xwho had not in him some evil.
The truth of it is, they generally found upon search, that
in the most vicious man Pleasure might lay claim to an
hundredth part; alnd that in the most virtuous man,9
Pain might come in for at least two-thirds.  This they
saw would occasion endless disputes between- them, unless they could come to some accommodation. To this end
there was a marriage proposed between them, and at
length concluded: by this means it is that we find'
Pleasure and Pain are such constant yoke-fellows, and that
they either make their visits together, or are never far asunder. If pain comes into a heart, he is quickly followed
by- Pleasure; and if Pleasure enters,: you may be sure Pain
is not far off.
-BUT notwithstanding this marriage was very convenient
for the two parties, it did not seemni to' answer the intention
of Jupiter in sending them among mankind. To remedy
therefore this inconvenience, it was stipulated between them
by article; and confirmed by the consent of each, family,
that notwithstanding they here possessed the species indif-.
ferently; upon the death. of every silgle person, if he was.
found to have in him a certain proportion of evils, he should:
be dispatched into the infernal regions by a passport fronm
Pain, there to dwell with Misery, Vice, and- the Furies.--
Or on the contrary, if he had in him a certain proportion.
of good, he should be dispatched into heaven by a passport
from Pleasure, there to dwell with; Happiness, Virtue, and!
the GObds.

took down his boy- from the ass, and mounted himself.

was so entertaining a sight, that the people ran in crowds

HERCULE S's CHOICE.
~W  HEN Hercules was in that part of his youth, in which.it was natural for him to consider what coulrse of life
he ought to pursue, he one day retired'into a desert, where
the silence and solitude of the place very much favoured his
meditations.  As he was musing on his present condition,
and very much perplexed in himself on the state of life he
should chuse, he saw two women, of a laiger stature than
ordinary approaching towards him. One of themn hada very
noble air, and graceful deportment; her beauty was natural
and easy, her person clean and unspotted, her eyes cast
towards the ground with an agreeable reserve, her mlotion
and- behaviour full of modesty, and' her raiment as white as:snow. The other had a great deal of health and floridness
in her countenace, which she had helped with an artificial
white and red; and endeavoured to appear more graceful than ordinary in her mien, by a mixture of affetation
in all her gestures.  She had a wolnderful confidence and
assurance in her looks, and all the variety of colours in
her dress, that she thought iere the most proper to
shew her complexion to advantage. She cast her eyes upon
hlerself, then turned them  on those that were present,
to see how they liked her, and often looked on the figure
she made in her own shadow. Upon her nearer approach
to Hercules, she stepped before, the other lady, who came
ftrward with a regulai composed carriage) and running up
to-him, accosted him after the following manner:
-MY dear Hercules, says she, I find you are very much

this world of pleasure, and bid farewel for ever to care,

HERGcULES hearing the lady talk after this manner, desired to know her name; to which she answered, my
friends, -and those who are well acquainted with- me, call
me''Happiness; but my enemies, and those who would
injure my reputation, have given me the name of: Pleasure.
By -this timie the other lady was come up, who1 addressed herself to the young hero in a veay different manner.

know you are descending from the Gods, and giving proofs
of that descent by your love to virtue, and application

peri'eftual wrinkles, and her temples were covered with a
wreath- of cypress anrd wormwood. From this union sprung
a virgin, in whom- might be traced a strong resemblance
to.both her parents; but the sullen and unamiable -features
of her mother were so mixed and blended with the sweetness. of liher father, that her countenance, though mournful,
was hlighly pleasing. The maids and shepherds of the
n eghouring plains gathered round, and called her PITY.
Aired-breast was observed to build in- the cabin where she
was born; and while she was yet an infant, a dove pursued
by a hawkflew into-her bosom. This nymph had a deje6ted appearance, but so soft and gentle a mein that she
was beloved to a degiee. of enthusiasm. Her voice was
low anrd plaintive, but inexpressibly. sweet; and she loved
to lie for hours together on the banks of some wild and
meIancholy stream, singirg to her lute. She taught men
to weep, for she took a strange delight in tears; and
often, w-hen- the virgins of the hamlet were assembled
at their evening  sports, she would steal in amongst
them, and captivate their hearts by her tales full of a
charming sadness. She wore on her head a garland -composed of her -father's myrtles, twisted with her mother's
cypress.
ONE day, as she sat musing-by. the waters of Helicon,
her tears by charie fell into the fountain; and ever since,

HTTIEN states and empires have their periods of declension, and feel in their turns what distress and
poverty is-I stop not to tell the causes wliich gradually
b)rought the house d'LE;~;  in Britany into decay. The.
aMarquis d'E **'* had fougiht up against his coirdition
with great firmness; wishing.) to preserve and still shew to
the world some little fragmeints of whlat his ancestors had
been-their indiscretion had put it out of his power.
There was enoupgh left for the little exigencies of obscurity
-But he had two boys who looked up to him for lighthe thought they deserved it. He had tried his sword-it
could not open the wvay--the mounting was too expensive--and simple economy was not a match for it -there
was no resource but commerce.
iIN any other province in France, save Britany, this
was smiting the;root for ever of the little tree his pride

and affeclion wished to see' re-blossomI-But in iBritany,
there being a provision for this, le availed himself of it;
and taking an occasion wvlen the states were assembled
at Rennes, the Marquis, attended with his two sons,
entered the court; and having pleaded the right of an
ancient law of the duchy, which, though seldom  claimed,
he said, was no less in force; he took his sword front
Ihis side--Here-said he-take it; and be trusty guardians of it, till better times put me in condition to reclaim
it.
TIE presidcent accepted the Marquis's sword-he staid
a few minuttes to see it deposited in the archieves of his
house--and departed.
Tnu H   Marquis and his sfamily embarked the next day
for Martinico, and in about nineteen or twenty years of
successful application to business, with some unlooked
for bequest from  distant branches of his housle-returned
home to reclaim his nobility and to support it.
IT was an incident of good fcrttune which will never
happen to aniy traveller, but a sentimental one, that I
should be at Rennes at the very tiime of this solemn requisition: I call it sole!mni-it was so to me.
T'HE Marquis entered the court with his whole familyr

and his youngest was at thle other extremne of the line
next his mother--he put hl-is hand- kcehief to his face

MARIA.- FIRST PART,
-HEY  were the sweetest notes I ever heard; and I
I   instantly let down the fore glass to hear them
more distinkly-'Tis Maria; said the postilion, observing I was listening-----Poor Maria, continued he, (lean.
ing his body on one side to let me see her, for she was
in a line between us) is sitting upon a bank playing her
vespers upon her pipe, with- her little coat beside her.
THE young fellow uttered this with an a-ccent and a look
so perfectly- in tune:to a feeling heart, that I instantly
made a vow, I would give him  a four and twenty sous
piece, wlen I got to Moulines_AND who is poor Maria? said I.
Ta E love and pity of all the villages around us; said the
postilion--it is but three years ago, that the sun did not
shine upon so fair, so quick-witted, and amiable a maid;
and better fate did Maria deserve, than to have her banns
forbid, by the intrigues of the curate of the parish who published thelimIIE was going on, when Maria, who had made a short
pause, put the pipe to her mouth and began the air again
-,they were the same notes;--yet were ten times sweeter.
It is the evening service to the Virgin, said the young man
-but who has taught her to play it-or how she came by
her pipe no one knows; we think that Hleaven has assist,
ed- her in both; for ever since she has been unsettled in
her mind, it seems.lher only consolation-she has never
once had the pipe out of her hand, but plays that service
upon it almost night and day.
TuHE postilion delivered this with so nmuch discretion and
natural eloquence, that I could not help decyphering something in his face above his condition, and should have sifted
out his history, had not poor Maria taken such full possession of mne.
-W r had got up by this tim;e almost to the bank where
Maria was sitting: she was in a thin white jacket, witl
her hair, all. but two tresses, drawn up in a silk net, vith a
few olive leaves twisted a little fantastically on one side--
she was beautiful; and if ever I felt the full force of an honest heart-ach, it was the moment I saw h-er328    NARRATIVE PIECES
GOD help her! poor dainsel! above a hundred masses,
said the postilion, have been said in the several parish,churches and convents around for her,---but without ef-,fedt; we have still hopes, as she is sensible for short intervals, that the Virgin at last will restore her to herself; but
her parents, who know her best, are hopeless upon that,score, and think her senses are lost for ever.
As the- postilion spoke this, Maria made a cadence so.melancholy, so tender and querulous, that I sprung out of'the chaise to help her, and found myself sitting betwixt her
and her goat before I relapsed from ray enthusiasm.
MARIA looked wistfully for somle time at me, and thea
at her goat-and then at me-and then at her goat again,
*and so on alternately-   WELL, MARIA, said I softly-What resemblance
do you find?
I Do intreat the candid rea(ler to believe me, that it was
from the hu,mblest conviction of what a beast man is,-that
I asked the question; and that I would not have let fallen
an unseasonable pleasantry, in the venerable presence of Misery, to be entitled to all the wit that ever Rabelais scattered.
ADIEU, Maria?--adieu, poor hapless damisel!-----somne
time, but not now, I may hear thy sorrows from thy own
lips--but I was deceived: for that moment she took her
pipe, and told me such a tale of woe with it, that I rose up,
and with broken and irregular steps walked softly to my
chaise.
SECOND PART.
HEN we had got within half a league of Mouliines,
at,a little openfing in the road leading to a thicket,
I discovered poor Maria sitting under a poplar-she was
sitting with her elbow in her lap, and her head leaning on
one side within her hand-a small brook run at the foot of
the tree.
I BADE the postilion go on with the chlaise to Moulines
-and La Fleur to bespeak my supper-and that I would
walk after him.
SHE was dressed in white, and much as my friend described-lher, except that her hlair hung loose, Nwhich before,was twisted within a silk net. She had, superadded likewise to lier jacket, a pale green ribband vwhich fell across
her shoulder to the waist; at the end of which hung hetr

iApe. Her go&amp;At had been as faithless as her lover; and she
had got a little dog in lieu of him, which she had kept
tied by a string to her girdle; as I looked at her dog, she
drew him towards her with the string"--  Thou shalt not
leave me, Sylvio," said she. I looked in Maria's eyes,
and saw she was thinking more of her father than of her
lover or her little goat; for as she uttered them, the tears
trickled down her cheeks.
I sA'r down close by her; and Maria let me wipe thein,
away as they fell, with my landkerchief. I then steeped it,
in my own--and then in her's-and then in mine-and then
I wiped her's again-and as I did it, I felt such undescribable emotions within me, as I am sure could not be accounted.
for from any comibinations of matter andl motion.
I AM positive I have a soul; nor can all the books with
which materialists have pestered the world ever convince
nie of the contrary.
\WHEN:Maria had come a little to herself, I asked her if
she remembered a pale thin person of a man who had sat
down betwixt her and lier goat about two years before? She
said, she was insettledc much at that time, but remembered
it upon two accounts-that ill as she was, she saw the per&amp;on pitied her; and next, that hler goat had stolen his handkerchief, and stie had beat him for the theft-she hlad, washed it, she said, in thle brook, and kept it ever since in'hler
pocket, to restore it to him in case she should ever see him
again, which, she added, he had half promised her. As
she told me this, she took the handkerchief out of her pocket to let me see it: she had folded it up neatly in a couple
of vine leaves, tied round with a tendril--on opening it, I
saw an S marked in one of the corners.
SHiE had since that5 she told m-e, strayed as far as Rome,
and walked round St. Peter's once-and returned backthat she found het way alone across the Apennines--had
travelled over all Lombardy without money-and throughl
the flinty roads of Savoy without shoes: how  she had
horn it, and howi she had got supported, she could not tell
-but God tempers the wind, said Maria, to the shorr
lamb.
SHORN indeed! and to the quick, said I; and wast thou
in my own land, where 1_ have a cottage, I would take thee
to it and shelter thee; thou shouldest eat of my own bread,
and drink of my own cup-I would be klnd to thy Sylvio
-in all thy wet1ikness,es and wanderin.gs I wtoulcl seek after

thee, and bring thee back-when the sun went down I would
say my prayers, and when I had done, thou shouldst play
thy evening song upon thy piipe; nor would the incense of
my sacrifice be worse accepted, for entering heaven along
with that of a broken heart.
NATURE mnelted witliin me, a,s I uttered this; and Maria
observing, as I took out my handkerchief, that it was steeDed too much already to be of use, would needs go wash it
ill the strean.--And where will you dry it, Maria? said II will dry it in my bosom," said she-it will do me good.
AND is your heart still so warm, Maria? said I.
I TOUCHED upon the string on which hung all her sorvows- she looked with wistful disorder for some time in mly
-face; and then, without saying any thing, took her pipe,
and played her service to the Virgin-'The string I hIad
touched ceased to vibrate-in a moment or two Maria returned to herself--let her pipe fall-and rose up.
AN.3 where are you going, Maria? saicl I.-She said, to
vl oulines.--Let us go, said I1 together.--Maria put her
arm within mine, and lengthening the string, to let the dog
follow-in that order we entered Moulines.
THOUGH I hate salutations and greetings in the marketl,'ace, yet when we got into--the middle of this, I stopped to
take my last look and last farewel of Maria.
1ItARIA, thoug-h not tall, w-as nevertheless of the first
order of fine forms---affli6ion had touched her looksvith something that was scarce earthly-still she was femixaine:-and so.much was there about her of all that the
heart wishes, or the eye l-ooks for in woman, that could the
traces be ever worn out of her brain, aiind those of Eliza's
out of rmine, she should not only eat of my bread and drink.
of my own cup, but Maria should lie inll my bosom, andbe unto me as a daughter.

bruised thee can only bind them up for ever.

such a. oie s a -modest o,an, sOrrmetimies in-rdeed  passes for

AtO-AiN.  A nman of assurancel thougl at first only denoted
a person of a free and opn carriar  is onow vl ry usually
aipplieid to a tprofii. te \&gt;: tc-r,  wh, o can break thriough all the
rules of decency an1 -mYor-lity without a blush.
I sHALL endeatiriour tilereiore in this essa)y to restore these
w ords t toheir tirue mneaning; to p5'event the idlea oi Modesty
fiolm being confoultic ed with tIhat of Sheepishness, ant to

lORa this r eastI' a mnlan t ruly mnodest is as mnuch so wtllen
he is alone as in company, and as subjeCt to a blush in his'closet, as wvhen tlhe eyes of multitudes are upon iilm.
I DO not renimenber to havie llet with any instance of maeodesty with which I am so well pleased, as that celebrated
onCe of the young Prince, wlhose fathier, being a tributary kingr
to the Romnans,  a. se-verl conmplaints laid i:ainst him be~~~~~~,.~!. Ibe

fore the senate, as a tyrant aind oppressor of his subje&amp;ts.
The Prince went to Rome to defend his father, but coming
into the senate, and hearing-a multitude of crimes proved
upon him, was so oppressed when it came to his turn to
speak, that he was unable to utter a word.  The stoiry tells
us, that the fathers were more moved at this instance of
modesty and ingenuity, than they could hl.ave been by the
most pathetic oration; and, in short, pardoned the guilty
father for this early -promise of virtue in the son.
I TAKE Assurance to be) The faculty of possessing a man'sself, or of saying and doing indifferent things without any
uneasiness or emotion in the mind. That which generally
gives a man assurance, is a moderate knowledge of the
world, but above all, a mind fixed andl determined in itself
to do nothing against the rules of llonour and decency. Ani
open and assured behaviour is the natural consequence of
stfch a resolution. A man thus armed, if ilis words or at-ions are at any time misinterpreted, retires within himself,
and from a consciousness of his own integrity, assumes
force enough to despise the little censures of i?gnorance or
malice.
EvERY one ought to cherish and encourage in himself the
mnodesty and'assurance I have here mentioned.
A MAN.without assurance is liable to be made uneasy by
the folly or ill-nature oI every one he converses witl..A
imian without modesty is lost to all sense of nhonour and virtue.
IT is moire than probable, that the Prince above--mentioned possessed both these qualifications in a very eminent de.
gree. ~Without assurance he would never have undertaken
to speak before the most august assembly in the world; without modesty he would have pleaded thie cause' he had taken
upoln'him, though it had appeared ever so scandalous.
FRO,M -vJwhat has bDeen said, it is plain, that modesty and
assurance are both amiable, and may very well meet in the
same person. Wi~hen they are thius mixed and blended together, they compose what we endeavour to express when we
say a modest assurance; by which we understand the just
mean between bashfulness and iimpudence.
I SIHALL conclude with observing, that as the -same man
may be both modest and assured, so it is also possible for
the same person to be both impudent and bashful.
WVE: have frequent instances of this odd kind of mixture
in people of depraved minds and mean education; w-ho

a sentence without confusion, can voluntarily comnimit the
greatest villainies, or most indecent a'tions.
Suci a person seenms to have mnaade a resolution to do ill
even in spite of himself, and in defiance of all those checks
and restr.aints his tenaper and complexion see m to have laid
in his way.v
UPON the whole, I wou-ld' endeavour to establish this
maxim, That the pra6tice of virtue is the.most proper method to give a man a becoming assurance in his words and
actions.  Gulilt always seeks to shelter itself in one of the
extremes, and, is sometimes attended with both.

ourselves, to those we converse with, and to the great Author of our being, it will not a little recommend itself on
each of these accounts. The man who is possessed of this
excellent frame of nlind, is not only easy. in his thoughts
but a perfeEti master of all the powers and faculties of his
soul': his imagination is always clear, and his judgment
undisturbed: his temper is even and unruffled, whethler in
aaion or in solitude. He comes with a relish to all those
goods which nature has prov-ided for him, tastes all the
pleasures of the creation which are poured upon him, and
does not feel the full weight of those accidental evils which
may befld him.
IF we consider him in relation to the persons whom he
converses with, it naturally; produces love and good-will towards him. A cheerful mind is not only disposed to be
affable and- obliging, but raises the same good-hlumour in
those who come within its influence. A man finds himself
pleased, he does not know why, with the cheerfulness of his
companion: it is like a sudden sunshine that awakens a se.cred delight in the mind, without her attending to it. The
heart rejoices of its own accord, and naturally flows out
into friendship and benevolence towards the person who
has so kindly an effeat upon it.
WMiiaN I coniider thl-is cheerful state of mind in its third
relation, I cannot but look upon it as a constant habitual
gratitucle to the Author of nature. An inward cheerfulness
is all implicit praise and thanksgivinig to Providence under
all its dispensations. It is a kind of acquiescence in the state
wherein we are placed, and a -secret approbation of the
Divine will in his condua1 towards man.
A MUi   who uses his best elndeavours to live according to
the di&amp;tates of virtue and riglht reason, has two perpetual
sources of cheerfulness, in the consideration of his own nature, and of that Being, on whom he has a dependence. If
lie looks into himnself, he cannot but rejoice in that existence, which is so lately bestowed ulpon1 him, and which,
after millions of ages, will be still new, and still in its beginning. How many self-congratulations naturally rise in
the mind, when it refle6ts on this its entrance into eternity;
when it takes a view of those improveable faculties, which
in a few years, and even'at its first setting out, have made so
considera1ble a progress, and which will be still receiving an
increase of perfe&amp;6ion, and consequently an increase of happiGness? The consciousness of such a Being spreads a perpetual diffusion of joy through the soul of a virtuous man, and
makes him look upon himself every moment as more happy than he knows how to conceive.
TaE. second source of cheerfulness to- a good mind, is its
consideration of that Being on whom we have our dependence, and in whom, though we behold him as yet but in
the first faint discoveries of his perfe&amp;ions, we see every
thing that-we can imagine as great, glorious, or amiable.
WVe find ourselves every where upheld by his goodness, and
surrounded with an immensity of love and mercy. In short,
we depeind upon a Being, whose power qualifies him to
make us happy by an infinity of means, whose goodness and
truth engage him to make those happy who desire it of
him) and whose unchangeableness will secure us in this
happiness to all eternity.
Suc -considerations, which every one should perpetually
cherish in his thouglhts, will banish from us all that secret
heaviness of heart which unthinking men are subjeEt to
w-hen they lie under no real afflidtioi.; all that anguish
which we may feel friom any evil that atlually oppresses us;
to which I may likewise add those little cracklings of mirth
and folly that are apter to betray virtue than support it;
and establish in us such an even and cheerful temper, as
makes us pleasing to ourselves, to those with whom we converse) and to him whom we were made to please.

ON SINCERITY'.
TRUTH and sincerity have all the advantages of appearance, and many more. If the shew of any thilng be
good for any thing, I am sure the reality is betteIr; for why
does anyvman dissemble, or seem to be that which he is
n'ot, but because he thinks it good to have the qualitie~s he
pretends to?' For to counterfeit and dissemble, is to put on
thle appearance of some real excellency. Now the best way
for a man to seem to be any thing, is really to be what he
would seem to be. Besides, it is often as troublesome to
support the pretence of.a good quality, as to have it; and if
a man have it not it is most likely he will be discovered to
Want it, and then all his labour to seem to have it is lost.
There is something, unnatural in painting, which a skilful
eye will easily discern from native beauty and comrplexion.

IT is hard to personate and a&amp; a part long; for wxhere truthl
is not at the bottom, nature will alw'ays be endeavouring to.
return, and will betray herself at one time or other. Therefore if any man think it convenient to seem good, let him
be so indeed, and then his goodness willv appear to every
one' s satisf'aaion; for truth is convincing, and carries its
own light and evidence along with it, and will not only commend us to every ralt's conscience, but, which is mucich
more) to God) who searcheth our hearts. So that upon all
accounts sincerity is true wisdom. Particularly as to the
affairs of this world, integrity hath many advantages over
all the artificial -mocles of dissimulation and deceit. It is
much the plainer and easier, much thle safer and more secure
way of dealing in the world: it hath less of trouble and difficulty. of entanglement and perplexity, of danger and hazard in it: it is the shortest and nearest way to our end,
carrying us thither in a straight line, and will hold out and
last longest. The arts of deceit and cunning continually
grow weaker and less effeaual and serviceable to those that
praaise them,; whereas integ'rity gains strength by use, and
the more and longer any man praaiseth it the gteater service it does him, by confirming. his reputation, and encouraging those with whom he hath to -do, to repose the greatest confidence in him, which is an unspeakable advantage
in business and the a-ffairs of life.
A DISSEMBLER must always be upon'his guard, and
watch himself carefully, that he do not contradiet his own
pretensions; for he a&amp;ts an unnatural part, and therefore
must put a continual force and restraint upon himself.
WVhereas he that a&amp;ts sincerely hath the easiest task in the
world; because he follows nature, and so is put to no trouble and care about his words and a6tions-; he needs not invent- any pretences before-hand, nor make excuses afterwards, for any thing he hath said or done.
BUT insincerity is very troublesome to manage; a hypocrite hath so many things to attend to, as make his life a
very perplexed and intricate thing. A liar hath need of a
good memory, lest he contradi&amp;t at one time what he said
at another; but truth is. always consistent with itself, and
needs nothing to help it out; it is always near at hand, and
sits upon our lips; whereas a lie is troublesome, and needs
a good many more to make it good.
ADD to all this, that sincerity is the most compendious
wisdom, and an excellent instrument for the speedy dispatchDEDICATION.
and that the scene will be r ealized, which Our PORTEs,
has so beautifully described:
TWhen this, this little group thleir country calls
From academic shades and learned halls,

And light up glory thro' her wide domain;
Their various tastes in different arts display'd,
Like temper'd harmony of light and shade,

And this adorn the state, and that defend..I am,

WILLIAMS ENFIELD.of business. It creates confidence in those we have to deal
with, saves the labour of many inquiries, and brings tbings
to an issue in few words. It is like travelling in a plain beaten road, which commonly brings a man sooner to his journey's end, than by-ways, in which men often lose tlem.
selves. In a word, whatsoever conveinience may be thought
to be in falshood and dissimulation, it is soon over; but the
inconvenience of it is perpetual, because. it brings a man
under an everlasting jealousy anld suspicion, so that he is
inot believed when he speaks trtlth, nor trusted when perhaps he means honestly. When a manl hath once forfeited
the reputation of his integrity, nothing will then serve his
turn, neither truth nor falshood.
INDE:ED, if a man were only to deal in the'world for a
day, and should never have occasion to converse more with
mankind, never more need their good opinioll or good word,
it were then no great matter (as far as respeOts the afi.irs
of this world) if he spent his reputation all at once, and
ventured it at one throw. But if he be to coiitinue in the
world, and would have the advantage of reputation whilst
he is in it, let him make use of truth and sincerity in all his
words and actions) for nothing but this will hold out to the
end. All other arts may fail, bult truth and integrity w'ill
carry a man through, and bear him out to the last.

CHIAP. IV.
ON HIONOUR.
LVERY principle that is a motive to good actions ought
to be encouiraged, since men are of so different a nmake,
that the same principle does not work equally upon all minds.
What some men are prompted to by conscience, duty or
religion, which are only different names for the same thing,
others are prompted to by honour.
THE sense of honour is of so fine and delicate a nature,
that it is only to be met with in minds which are naturally
noble, or in such as have been cultivated by great examples, or a refined education. This essay therefore is chiefly designed for those who by means of ally of these advantages are, or ought to be aauated by this glorious principle.
BUT as nothing is more pernicious than a principle orf
aetion, when it is mnisunderstood, I shall consider hotnou-r
with respe't to three sorts of men. First of all, with regard.59,'DIDACTIP~C  PIECES.~S
Bou. lXl.CIapt. I}.        DIDACTIC PIECES.                    5S
to those who have a right notion of it. Secondly, with regard to those who have a mistaken notion of it. And
thirdly, with regard to those who treat it as chimerical,
and turn it into ridicule.
IN the first pJace" true honour, though it be a different
principle from religion, is that which produces the same
ef-e&amp;s. The lines of action, though drawn fromn different
parts, terminate in the same point. Religion embraces virtue, as it is enjoined by the laws of God; honour, as it is
graceful and ornamental to human nature. The religious
nan fears, t-ihe man of honour scorns to do an ill aation.
The latter considers vice as something that is beneath hin,g
the other as something that is offensive to the Divine Being.
The one as what is unbecQmin-, the other -as what is forbidden. Thus Seneca speaks in the natural and genuine language of a man of honor, when he declares, that were there
no God to see or punish vice, he would not commit it, because it is of so mean, so base, and so vile a nature.
I SHALL conclude this head With the description of honor in the parting of young Juba.
Honour's a sacred tie, thelaw of kings,
The noble rnind's distinguishing perfetion,
T'hat aidts and strengthens virtue when it meets her,
And imitates her a"tions where she is not.
It oulJht not to be sported with.--
Cato.
IN the second place, we are to consider those who have
mnistaken notions of honour. Aind these are such as establish any thing to themselves for a point of honour which
is contwary either to the laws of God, or of- their country;
uwho think it more honourable to revenge than to forgive an
injury; who make no scruple of telling a lie, but would
pit any man to death that accuses them of it; who are more
careful to guard their reputation by their courage than by
tiheir virtue. True fortitude is indeed so becoming in humai
nature, that he who wants it scarce deserves the name of a
mrlan; but we find several who so much abuse this notion,
that they place the whole idea of honour in a kind of brutal
courage; by which meanis we have had many among us who
have called themselves men of honour, that would have
been a disgrace to a gibbet. In a'word, the man who sacrifices any duty of a reasonable creature to a prevailing
im;ode or fashion, who looks upon any thing as hornourablv
2S4,      DiDACTIC1 PECES.                  Book I1I'
that is displeasing to his mnaker, or destruaive to society,:who, thinks himself obliged by this principle to the p'raiice
of some virtues and not of others, is by no means to be
reckoned among true men of honour.
TIMO- GEN r ES was a lively instance of one a6luated by false
honour. Timogenes would smile at a man's jest who riciculed hi:s Maker, and at the same time, run a man through
the body that spoke ill of his friend. Timogenes would
have scorned to have betraye(l a secret, that was intrusted
with him, though the fate of his couxntry depen(led upon
the discovery of it.. Timogenes took away the life of a
youn,g fellow in a duel, for having spoke ill of Belinda, a
lady whom he himself had seduced in her youth, and betrayed into want and ignominy. To close his characder, Timaogenes, after having ruined several poor tradesmen's familes who had trusted him,.sold his estate to satisfy his
creditors; but like a man of honour, disposed of all the money he could make of it, in the paying of his play-debts, or
to speak in his own language, his debts of honour.
INX the third place, we are to consideP- those persons, whiil
treat this principle as chimerical, and turn it into ridicule.,
Men who are professedly of no honour, are of a moire profligate and abandoned nature than'even those who are aEtuatedl
by false notions of it, as there is more hope of a heretic
than of an atheist. These sons of infamy consider honour
with old Syphax, in the play befdre-mnentioinedl as a fine
imaginary notion that leads astray youn~g unexperienced Imnen,
and draws them into r-eal mischiefis, while they are engagedt
in the pursuits of a shadow,\ T'hese are generally personsW'ho, in Shakespear's phrase, " are worn and hackneyed in,
the ways of men;'" whose imaginations are grown callous,
and have lost all those delicate sentinients which are naturaV
to mindsthat are innocent and undepravecd. Such old battered:miscreants ridicule every thing as romantic that comes
in compedition with their present interest, and treat those
persons as visionaries, who dare stand up in a corrupt age,,
for what has not its imtmediate- reward joined to it. The
talents, interest, or experience of such men, m-nake' them.
very often useful in all parties, and at all times. Bu't whvatever wealth and dignities they may arri-ve at, they ou0ght to.

ON GOOD 1-iHUTMOUR.
G OOD humour may be defined    a habit of being pieased;
a constant and perennial softness of nanner, easiness
of approach, and suavity of disposition; like that which
every man perceives in himself, when the transports of new
felicity have subsided, and his thoughts are onily kept in
motion by a slow succession of soft impulses. Good humnlour
is a state between gaiety and unconcern; the aCt or emlanation of a mind at leisure to reg-ard tlhe gratificaticn of another.'ITr is imagined by many, that whenever they aspire to
please, they are required to be merry, and to shew the glad-.
ness of their souls by flights and pleasantry, and bursts of
laughter. But though these men may be for a time heard
with applause and adnmiration, they seidom delight us long.
SWe enjoy them a little, and then retire to easiness'anid good
lhumour, as the eye" gazes awh ile on eminences glitteringi
with the sun, but soon turns aching away to verdure and to
flowers.
GA-IETY is to goQd iumour aS animal perfames to. veg-etable fragrance; the one o-verpowers weak spirits, and tihe
other recrefates and revives them. Gaiety seldom fails to
give some pain;  the hearers either. strain their faculties to
accompany its toweritrgs, or are Ieft "ibehind in envy and
despair. - Good humnour boasts no factilties which every one
does not believe in his. powera, and pleases principally i)y'not offendcing
IT is well krown, that the most certain way to give any
man pleasure, is to persuadle him that yotiu receive pleasure
from himr, to encourage him to freedomn and confidence, -and
to avoid any'such appearanc e of superiority as may overbear
and depress him. We see manoy that by this art only, spend
their days in the midst of caresses, invitations, and civilities;
and without any extraordinar-y qualities or attainments, are
the universal favotrites of both sexes, and certainly find a
friend in every place. The darlings ofthe world will, in-.
deed, be generally found sucdh as excite neither jealousy nor
fear; and are not considered as candidates for any eminent
degree of reputation, but-content' themselves witi-common-m
accomplishments, and endeavqajr rather to solicit kindness
than to raise esteenm. Tielrefore i n assemblies and places ofresort it seldom fails to happen, that though at the entrance
of some particular person every face brightens with.gladness, arid every hand is extended in salutation, yet if you
ptursue hiim beyond the first exchange of civilities, you will
find him of very small imnportance, and only welcome to the
company, as one by vwhom all conceive themselves admired,
and with whrn any one is at liberty to amuse hiniself when
he can find no other auditor or companion; as oine with
whom all are at ease, who will hear a jest without criticism,
and a iiarrat.ive without contradi&amp;tion; who laughs with every wvit, and yields to every disPluter.'1IER za v re  many,an hose vanity always inclines them to
associate wi:th those firomn wlhomn they have no reason to fear
r-iortification; and there al-e times in which the wise and the

and vulgar quality, we find it often negleated by those that
having excellencies of highel reputation and brighter splen,
dor, perhaps imagine that they have some right to gratify
themselves at the expence of othlers, and are to demand com.,
pliance, rather than to praaise it. It is by some unfortunate
mistake that almnost all those who have any claim to esteer
or love, press their pretensions with too little consideration
of others. This mistake my own interest as well as my
zeal for general happiness makes me desirous to recaify; for
I- have a friend, who because he knows his own fidelity and
usefulness, is never willing to sink into a companion. I
have a wife whose beauty first subdued me, and whose wit
confirmed her conqiuest; but whose beauty now serves no
other purpose than to entitle her to tyranny, and whose wit
is only used to justify perverseness.
SiBRELY nothing can be more unLreasonable than to lose
the will to please, when we are conscious of the powert, or
she-w more cruelty than to chpse any kind of influence before
that of kindness. I-e that regards the welfare of others,
should make his virtue approachIable, that it may be loved
and.copied; and he that conlsiders the wants which every
man feels, or will feel of external assistance, must rather
wish to be surrounded by those that love him, than by those
that admire his excellencies, or solicit his favours; for admiration ceases withl novelty, andi interest gains its end; and
retires. A man whose great qualities want the ornament of
superficial attraations, is like a naked mountain with mines
of gold, which wiUll be frequented only till the treasure is
exhausted.

CHIAP. VI.
ON THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD.
N   OTHING has so much exposed men of learning to contempt alnd ridicule, as their ignor-ance of things which
are known to all but themselves. Those who have been
tau-ght to consider the institutions of the schools, as giving
the last perfection to'human abilities, are surprised to see
men wrinkled with study, yet wanting to be instruaed in
the minute circumstances of propriety, or the necessary
forms of daily transadtion; and quickly shake off their reverence for modes of education, which they find to produce
no ability above the rest of mankind.BooKS, says Bacon, can never teach the use of books,
The student must learn by commerce with mankind to reduce his speculations to pra&amp;ice, and accommodate his
knowledge to the purposes of life.
IT is too common for those who have been bred to scholastic professions, and passed much of their time in acade-mries, where nothing but learning confers honours, to disregardcl every other qualification, and to imagine that they shall
find mankind ready to pay homage to their knowledge, and
to crowd about thlem for instru&amp;tion. They therefore step out
firom their cells into t1he open world, with all the confidence
of autlhority and dignity of importance; they look round
about them at once with ignorance and scorn on a race of
beings to whom they are equally unknown and equally
contemptible, but whose manners they must initate, and
with whose opinions they must comply, if they desire to
pass their time happily among them.
ToIo lessen that disdainS With which scholars are inclilned to
look on the common business of the world, and the unwillingness with which they condescend to learn what is not to
be found in any system of philosophy, it may be necessary
to consider, that thoulgh admiration is excited by abstruse
researches anld remote discoveries, yet pleasure is not given,
nor affewtion conciliated but by softer accomplishments,and,
qualities more easily communicable to those about us. IHe
that canl only converse upon questions, about which only a
small part oi mankind has knowledge sufficient to make tlh-em
curious, 1must lose his days in unsocial silence, and live in
the crowond o' life without a companion. He that can only
be useful in greCat occasions, may die without exerting his
abilities, aciC stand a helpless spectator of a thousand vexations which firet away happiness, and- whicJi nothing is required to remove but a little dexterity of conduCt and readiness ot expedients.
No degr~.e of knowledge attainable by man is able to set
Lim above the want of hourly assistance, or to exting~uish the
desire of fond endearments, and tender officiousness; and
therefore, no one shoutld think it unnecessary to learn those
arts by-which fri-endship may be gained. Kindness is preserved by a constant reciprocation of benefits or interchange
of pliasures: but such benefits only can be bestowed, as
others are capable of receiving, and such pleasures only imparted, as others are quali-fied to enjoy.
B-r this descent from the pinnacles of art no honour will

THE ADVANTAGES OF VUNITING GENTLENESS
OF MANNER'S WITH FIRMNESS OF MIND.
I mentioned to you- some tinme ago, a sentence, which I
would most earnestly wish you always to retain in your
thoughts, and observe in your conduct; it is Suaviter inf
modo, fortiter in re. I do not know any one rule so unexceptionable useful and necessary in every part of life.
THE suaviter int modo alone would degenerate and sink
into a mean, tinlid complaisance, and passiveness, if not
supported and dignifyed by thefortiter in re; which would also
run into impetuosity and brutality, if not tempered and softened by the suaviter in modo: however, they are seldonm
united. The warm choleric man, with strong animal spirits, despises the suaviter in modo, and thinks to carry all
before him by thefortiter in re. He may possibly, by great
accident, now and then succeed, when he has olnly weak
and timid people to deal with; but his general fate will be,
to shock, offend, be hated, and fail. On the other hand,
the cunning crafty man thinks to gain all his ends by the
suaviter in mnodo only i he becomes all things to all men;
he seems to have no opinion of his own, and servilely adopts
the present opinion of the present person; he insinuates himself only into the esteem of fools, but is soon deteced, and
surely despised by every body else. The wise man (who
differs as much from the cunning, as firom the choleric man)
alone joins the suaviter in'modo with the fortiter in re.
IF you are in authority, and have a right to command,
your comman-ds delivered suaviter in modo will be willingly,
clieerfully, and consequently well obeyed;- whereas if given
only fortiter, that is brutally, they will rather,' as Tacitus
says, be interpreted than executed. For my own part, if I
bade my footman bring me a glass of wine, in a rough insulting manner, I should expe6t, that in obeying -me, he
would contrive to spill some of it upon me; and I am sure
I should deseirve it. A cool steady resolution should s:how,
that where you have a right to command, you will be obey60          DIDACTIC PIECES.                   Book III.
ed; but at the same time, a gentleness in the manner of
enforcing that obedience, should make it a cheerful one, and
soften, as much as possible, the mortifying consciousness of
inferiority. If you are to ask a favour or even to solicit
your due, you must do it suaviter in modo, or you will give
those, who have a mind to refuse you either, a pretence to
do it, by resenting the mnanner; but, on the other hand,
you must by a steady perseverance and decent tenaciousness,
show the fortiter in re. In short, this precept is the only
way I know in the world, of being loved without being despised, and feared without being hated. It constitutes the
dignity of clh-ariater, which every wise man must endeavour
to establish.
IF therefore you find that you have a hastiness in your
temper, which unguardedly breaks out into indiscreet sallies,
or rough expressions, to either your superiors, your equals,
or your inferiors, watch it narrowly, check it carefuilly, and
call the su;aviter in, modo to your assistance: at the first inipulse of passion be silent, till you can be soft. Labour even
to get the command of your coiuntenanlce so well, that those
emotions may not be read in it: a most unspeakable advantage in business! On the other hand, let no complaisance,
no gentleness of temper, no weak desire of pleasing on your
part, no wheedling, coaxing, nor flattery, o0n other people's,
make you recede one jot firom any point that reason and
prudence have bid you pursue; but return to the charge,
persist, persevere, and you will find most things attainable
that are possible. A yielding, timid meekness is always
abused and insulted by the unjust and the unfeeling; but
meekness, when sustained by the fortiter in re, is always respeEted, commornly successful. In your friendships and
conneEtions, as well as in your intimacies, this rule is particularly useful; let youvr firmness and vigour, preserve and
invite attachments to you; but at the same time, le.t your
manner hinder the enemies of your friends and dependents
from becoming youir's: let your enemies be disarmed by the
gentleness of your imanner, but let them feel at the same
time, the steadiness of your just resentment; for there is
a great difference between bearing malice, which is always
ungenerous, and a resolute self-defence, which is always
prudent and justifiable.
I coNcLUvE with this observation, That gentleness of
manners, with firziness of mind, is a short, but full description of human perfe6tion, on this side of religious and moral duties.                              Lord Chesterfield.CHAP. VIII.

many of its properties seems very much to resemble instinc.
It would be improper, therefore, to say, that Sir Isaac New.
ton shewed his good sense, by those amazing discoveries
which he made in natural philosophy: the operations of this
gift of heaven are rather- instantaneous, than the result of
any tedious process. Like Diomed, after Minerva had endued him with the power of discerning gods from mortals,
the man of good sense discovers at once the truth- of those
objects he is most concerned to distinguish: and conduLas
himself with suitable caution and security.
IT is for this reason, possibly, that this quality of the
mind is not so often found united with learning as one could
wish: for good sense being accustomed to receive her discoveries without labour or study, she cannot so easily wait for
those truths, which being placed at a distance, and lying
concealed under numberless covers, require much pains
and application to unfold.
BUT though good sense-4s not in the number, nor always,
it must be owned, in the company of the sciences; yet is it  
(as-the most sensible of' poets has justly observed)
fairly worth the seven.
ReEtitude of understanldingi  is indeed the most useful, as well
as the most noble of hum.lan eindo6wments, as it is the sovereign guide alid direCtor in every branch of civil and social
intercourse.
UPON whatever occalsion this enlightenling the faculty is exerted, it is al.ways sure to a6t, with distinruisied elinence iblt
its chief and peculiar province seems to lie in the commerce
of the v,orld, A.ccordingly we mnay observe, that those who
have conversed mnore with men than with books; whose wisdom-n is derived rather firon experience than contempl.:tion

M   UCH declamation has been employed to convince
the world of a very plain truth, that to be able to
speak well is an ornamental and us3ful accomplishment.
Without the laboured panlegyrics of ancient or modern
orators, the importance of a good elocution is suffic'ientlv
obvio)us, Every one will acknowledge it to be of some
consequence, that what a man has hourly occasion to do,
shou'd be done well. Every private company, and almost
every pu,blic assembly affords opportunities of remarking
the difference between a just and graceful, and a faulty
and unnatural elocution; and there are few persons who
do not daily experience the advantages of the former, or
the iticonveniencie,s of the latter. The great difficulty is,
not to prove that it is a desirable thing to be able to read
and speak with propriety, but to point out a pradical
and easy method by which this accomplishment may be
acquired.
FOLLOW Nature, is certainly the fundamental law of
Oratory, without a regard to which, all other rules will
only produce affe&amp;ed declamation, not just elocution. And
some accurate observers, judging, perhaps, from a few
unlucky specinmens of modern eloquence, have concluded

ON STUDY.
ITUDIES serve for delight, for ornament, and for abiOk lity. The chief use for delight is in privateness and
retiring; for ornament, is in discourse; and for ability, is
in the judgment and disposition of business. For expert men
can execute, and perhaps judge of particulars one by one;
but the general counsels, and the plots, and marshalling of
~affairs, come best from those- that are learned. To spend
too much time in studies is sloth; to use them too much for
ornament is affetlation; to make judgment wholly by, their
rules is the hulmour of a scholar. They perfea nature, and
ate perfeated by experience; for natural abilities are like
natural plants, that need pruning by duty, and studies
theniselves do give forth dire&amp;tions too much at large, except
they be bounded in by experience. Crafty men contemn
studies, simple men admire them, and wise men use them:
for they teach not their own use, but that is a wisdom without them, and above them, won by observation. Read not
to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but-to weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed,
and some few to be chewed and digested; that is, some
books are to be read only in parts; others to be read, but
not curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and with
diligence and attention. Some books also may be read by
deputy, and extraCts made of them  by others; but that
should be only in the less important arguments, and the
meaner sort of books; else distilled books are like common
distilled waters, flashy things. Reading maketh a full
man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man..And therefore, if a man write little, lhe had need have a
great memory; if he confer little, he lad need have a present wit, and if he read little, he had need have much
cunning to seem to know what he doth not.

culties which no after wit can extricate thee out of. In these:
sallies, too oft I see, it happens- that the person laughed
at, considers himself in the light of a person injured, with
all the rights of such a situation belonging to him; anhd
when thou viewest Iiimin that light too, and reckonest upon
his friends, his family, hlis kindred and allies, and musterest up with them the many recruits which will list under him
from a sensz of common danger;'tis no extrava.gant arith-:
metic to say, that for every ten jokes, thou hast got an hundred enemies; and, till thou hast gone on, and raised a
swarm of wasps about thine ears, and art half stung to
death by them, thou wilt never be convinced it is so.
I CANNOT suspeca it in the man whom I esteem, that
there is the least spur firom spleen or malevolence of intent
in these sallies. I believe and know them to be truly honest and sportive; but consider, that fools cannot distinguish this, and that knaves will not; and thou knowest not
what it is, either to provoke the one, or to -make merry
with the other: whenever they associate for mutual defence, depend upon it they will carry on the war lin such a
manner against thee, my dear friend, as to make thee
heartily sick of it, and of thy life too.
REVENGE from some bane corner shall level a tale of
dishonour at thee, which no innocence of heart or integrity
of condua shall set right. The fortunes of thy house shall
totter-thy charaater, which led the way to them, shall
bleed on every side of it--thy fitith questioned--tly works
belied--thy wit forgotten-thy learning trampled on. To
wind up the.last scene of thy tragedy, CRUELTY and CowARDICE, twin ruffians, hired and set on by 1MALICE in' the
dark, shall strike together at all thy infirmities- and mistakes: the best of us, my friend, lie open there, and trust
me-when to gratify a private appetite, it is once resolved
upon, that an innocent and an helpless creature shall be sacrificed, it is an easy matter to pick up sticks enough from
any thicket where it has strayed, to make a fire to offer it
ulp with.

IHAMLET's INSTRUCTIONS TO TIHE PLAYERS.
S_PEAK the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
trippingly on hce tongue. Butif -you mouth it, as ma64    ~     e~DIDACTIC PIECES.                 Book U1r.
ny of our players do, I had as lieve - the town crier had spoke
mny lines. And do not saw the air too much with your hand
thus; but use all gently; for in tlhe very torrent, tempest,
and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you must
acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness.
Oh! it offends me to the soul, to hear a robusteous periwig-pated fellow -tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to
split the ears of the groundlings; who (for the most part)
are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shews and
noise: I couldl lhave such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing
termi,agant; it out-herods Herod. Pray you, avoid it.
BE not too tamie neither; but let your own discretion be
your tutor. Suit the aStion to the word, the word to the
a&amp;fion~, with the special observance, that you o'erstep not
tthe mnodesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is from
the purpose of playing; whose end, both at the first and
naow, was and is, to hold, as'twere, the imirror up to nature; to shew virtue her own feature, scorn her own image,
and the very age and body of the time, his form and pressure.
N~ow, this overdone, or come tardy of, though it make the
unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve: the
censure of one of which must in your allowance o'erweigh a:w7hole theatre of others. Oh! there be players that I have
seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to
speak it profanely) that, neither having the accent of
Christian, nor the gait of Christian, Pagan, nor man, have
so struted and bellowed, that I have thought'somne of na.
ture's journeymen had made men, and not made them well;
they imitated humanity so abominably.
AND let t,ose that play your clowns, speak no more than
is set down for them': for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren speEtators to
laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered:--that's villainous: and shews a most pitiful ambition in the fool that
uses it.,Szakespear.

Some happier island in-the wat'ry waste,
WVhere slaves once mo re:4.heir native land behold,
No fiends torment, no Clhristians thirst for gold.

He asks no Angel's wing, no Seraphi's fire:
But thinks admitted to that equal sky,

Go, wiser thou! and in thy scale of sense,
Weigh thy Opinion against Providence;
Call imperfe6lion what thou fanciest such,

In Pride, in reas'ning Pride, our error lies;
All quit their sphere, and rush into the skies.
Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes,
Men would be Angels, Angels would be Gods.
Aspiring to be Gods, if Angels fell,
Aspiring to be Angels, Men rebel:
And who but wishes to invert the laws
Of ORDIER sins against th' Eternal Cause.

Alike essential to th' amazing Whole,

Let earth, unbalanc'd fromn her orbit fly,
Planets and Suns run lawless thro' the sky;
Let ruling Angels from their spheres be huri'cd,
Being on Being wreck'd and world on world;

And Nature tremble to the throne of GOD..All this dread ODE:a break-ifor whom? for tlee

To serve mere engines to the ruling Mind  
Just as absurd for any part to claim
To be another, in this gen'ral frame:
Just as absurd, to mourn the tasks or pains,
The great dire&amp;ting MIND of ALL orcdains.
AI.L are but parts of one stupendous whole,
WVhose body Nature is, and God the soul:
That chang'd thro' all, and yet in all the same,

Wvarms in the sun, refreshes in- the breeze,
Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees,
Lives thro' all life, extends thro' all exteIlt
Spreads undivided, operates unspent;
Breaths in our soul, informs our mortal part,
As full, as perfedt, in a hair as heart;
As full, as perfet, in vile Man that mourns,
As the rapt Seraph that adores -and burns:
To him no high, no low, no great) no small;
He fills, he bounds, conneas, and equals all.

Safe in the hand of one disposing Fow'r,
Or in the natal, or the mortal hour.
All Nature is but Art, u-nknown to thee;
All Chance, Dire&amp;tion, which thou canst not see;

One truth is clear, WHVATEVER IS, Is RaIGHT.

Force first made Conquest, and that conquest, Law;'Till Superstion taught the tyrant awe,
Then shar'd the Tyranny, then lent it aid,
And Gods of Conqu'rors, Slaves of Subjects made:
She'midst the lightning's blaze,, and thunder's' sound,
When rock'd the mountains, and when groan'd the ground,
She taught the weak to bend, the proud to pray,
To Pow'r unseen, and imightier far than they:
She,' from the rending earth and bursting skies,
Saw Gods descend, and fiends infernal rise:
Here fix'd the dreadftl, there the blest abodes;
Fear made her Devils, and weak Hope her Gods;
Gods partial, changeful, passionate, unjust,
Whose aftributes were Rage, Revenge, or Lust;
Such as the souls of covards might conceive,
And, form'd like tyrants, tyrants would believe.
Zeal then, not charity, become the guide;
And hell was built on spite, and heav'n onI pride.
Then -sacred seemi'd th' ethereal vault no more;
Altars grew marble then, and reek'd with gore;
Then first the Flamuen tasted living food;
Next his grim idol smear'd with human blood;
With Heav'n's own thunders shook the world below,
And play'd the God an engine on his foe.
So drives Self-love, tliro' just and thro' unjust,
To one Man's pow'r, ambition, lucre, lust:
The same Self- love, in all, becomes the cause
Of what restrains hin, Government and Laws.
For, wha't one likes if others like as well,
What serves one will, when many wills rebel?
How shall he keep, wvhat, sleeping or awake,
A weaker may surprise, a stronger take!
His safety must his liberty restrain:
All join to gu;ard what each desires to gain.
Forc'd into virtue thus by Self-defence,
Ev'n kings learn'd justice and benevolence:
Self-love forsook the path it first pursu'd,
And fouind the private in the public good.'TwAs then, the studious head or gen'rous mind,
Follow'r of God, or frilend of human-kind,
Poet or patriot, rose but to restore
The Faith and Moral, Nature gave before;
Re-lum'd her ancient light, not kindled new;
If not God's image, yet his shadow drew;Chap. XV.          DIDACTIC PIECES.                  69
Taught Pow'r's due use to People and to Kings;
Taught nor to slack, nor stain its tender strings,
The less, or greater, set so jutstly true,
That touching one must strike the other too;'Till jarring int'rests, of themselves create
Th' according music of a well-mix'd State.
Such is the world's great harmony, that springs
From Order, Union, full Cqnsent of things:  
Where small and great, where weak and mighty, made
To serve, not suffer, strengthen, not invade;
IVore pow'rful each as r/eedful to the rest,
And, in proportion as it blesses, blest;
Draw to one point, and to one centre bring
Beast, Man, or Angel, Servant, Lord, or King.
FOR Forms of Governm ent let fools contest;
WVhate'er is best administer'd is -best:
7For Modes of Faith let grac,less  zealots fight;
Hlis can't be wrong whose life is in the right:
In Faith and Hope the world will disagree,
But all MankLind's concern is Charity.
All must be false that thwart this One great End;
Aind all of God, that l'lss Mankindl or mend.
MAxAN, like the gen'rous vine, supported lives;
The strength he gains is from th' erabrace he gives,
On their own axis as the Planets run,
Yet make at once their circle rouind the Sun;
So two consistent motions act the Soul;
And one regards Itself, and one the %tWhole.

And bade Self-love and Social be the same.

In who'obtain defence, or who defencd,
In him who is, or him who finds a friiend,

One common blessing, as one common soul.
But Fortune's gift if each alike possest,
And each were equal, must not all contest?
If then to all men Happiness was meant,

FORTUNE her gifts may variously dispose,
And these be happy call'd, unhappy those;
But Heav'n's just balance equal will appear,
While those are plac'd in hope, and these in Fear:

But future views of better, or of worse.
Oh sons of earth! attempt y'e still to rise,

And buries madmen in the heaps they raise.
