includes the eastern half of the World, and embraces
Europe, Asia, Africa, and New Holland. E These, to-
gether, contain twice as much land as the Western Hem-
isphere, and sixteenptimes as many people A

f 2. Asia is that part of the World Which was iﬁrstin-
habited by man, and has always been the most populous
division of the’ «globe. Itwas in»Asia that Adam. and
Eve dwelt, and here Noah and his childrenlived.

 From Asia, allthe other portions of the globe be-

came peopled. ’. The descendants of Noah spread them- A

selves ﬁrst over Asia, then ‘oVerAfrica, and then over
Europe. Atvvhat time the ﬁrst epeoplewent fromAsia
to America, We do not know.

Lesson XLVII.  History of Europe.

The history of Emjope begins with the settlement
of Greece, 1856 years before Christ, and in its progress
tells us of the . achievements of the Greeks; of their

oets, Warriors, and statesmen. It tells usof the rise

and fall of, Home; of thedark ages; and of the be- p

ginning and‘ progress of the modern nations Who now
ﬂOl1I‘1Sl_1o1Il this quarter of the World. by g r    
The history of America only goes back to -the time of its discovery by Co-
lumbus —— but a little more than -350 years ago.’ What happe_ned in America
previous to that ‘time, Wefcannot know ; for the native Indians had no books,
and no means [of -preserving their history. ‘ But we are able: to_ learn the
history of Europe for several thousand-years. It is supposed to have been
near 3000 years after the world was made, and about 3000 years ago, that
Greece (Was ﬁrst settled by a colony from Egypt. Previous to this time,
Greece was inhabited by a rude and barbarous people, who ate herbs and
roots; dwelt in the open air, and in clefts of rocks ; and lived, in short, like
wild beasts. , G i e ‘ V ' eh i t . 7 p‘
But“ after the arr_ival of the Egyptian cplony, they began to be civilized,
and -ﬁnally they became one of ‘the wisest "and most polished ‘of all the an-
cient nations. They built splendid cities, and the temples they erected for
the purposes of their religion Were exceedinglybeautiful. The ruins of
these temples are still to be seen in Greece, and every person who looks
uponthem is struck with Wonder and admiration. » - ' .
At length, having ﬂourished about 1400 years, the Grecians were con-
quered by the -Romans, and became subject to, the Roman government.
This happened near 2000, years ago. Since.that time the people of Greece

havebeen in a state of _bondage to other -nations, until a recent period, when

they achievedtheir independence, as has been related. «

The city of Rome, in Italy, Was founded about 2500 years ago. In a few

124 E A HISTORY or EUROPE’

centuries the Romans became a mighty‘ nation, and ‘conquered, by their
armies, nearly the whole of Europe, Asia, and Africa. After ﬂourishing in
great splendor, the Roman empire fell in pieces, never to be again united.
The numerous nations it had enslaved in its wide dominion were separated
from it;‘ and about 1400 years ago, the city of Rome itself was taken and
nearly destroyed by some rude. people from the north , of Europe. It is
still an interesting city, but it, is as wonderful for its ruins as for " its other
objects of c-uriosity._ , , . ’ V . ' . _ _

-After thefall of Rome, the dark ages came on,and, for many centuries,
not only Europe, but all the world, seemed buried in ignorance, superstition,
and slavery. ‘This’ was a sad and fearful time, and the history of it is very
painful. to read. It isfnow about 500 years since the nations of Europe
began to rise from this state of degradation. They have gradually ad-
vanced, till at length knowledge’ is increased, and spread over the land‘.

It is true that, inmany parts of Europe, the mass of the people are still ig-
norant and poor, and are kept so by their kings and rulers. In America, our
rulers a_re‘.ge‘nerally, wise and just men; and if they do wrong, the people re-
nounce them and choose others. " But in most» parts of Europethe people do

not choose their kings. and rulers; and if they are ever so cruel, the people

cannot very well help themselves. , _ g

It is also true that the kings of‘. Europe are too often proud and ambi-
tious men, and they frequently quarrel with each other, and thus draw their
people into Wars._ France, England, Russia, Prussia, and in fact all the
other nations of Europe,’have been frequently engaged in war, and war is

E the. greatest calamity that can happen to a nation. It is to be hoped,‘how-

ever, that the ‘love of peace is growing among the rulers of all countries. ’ _
A few years since, there was a man, 1n Europe, whose name was Bona-
parte. He possessed a great mind, and great ambition. He became em-

peror of France, but he wished to reign over all Europe ;, sq, he raised mighty ,

armies, an_d he went against the nations. A All over Europe there was the
Sound of b-attleand’ the cry of war. Armies of men on foot, and men on
horseback, were marching in everydirection. Often these armies met, and
many a ﬁeld was stained with blood. ‘

In the year 18.12, Bonaparte marched, with nearly half a million of men,
against Russia. Aswe have related, he took Moscow, and supposed he
should now be able to dictate his own terms to the czar. But he was sadly

Bonaparte at Moscow.

_ ridiculous, that one day,.in the midst of the burning. city, Bonaparte saw one

of‘ his soldiers heating his tea-kettle in the ﬁre of a blazing church.

., Bonaparte found that Winter was now approaching, and he had no pro-
visions for his army. Hewas, therefore, obliged to retreat, with his im-
mense force. The Russians harassed them on their march, and thousands
of them were slain, while other thousands perished in the snow. The na-
tions of . Europe were now roused,.a.nd Bonaparte was ﬁnally defeated in the
great -battle of Waterloo, and sent to St. Helena, a lonely island in the
Atlantic, Where he died in 1821.. His bodyhas been recently taken up,

. and carried to Paris, where itis entombed. Since the time of Bonaparte,

there have been no great w_ars in Europe.

We may, indeed, hope that the rulers of Europe, as well as all good men,’ .

are becoming more and more satisﬁed that war is one of the greatest of evils,
and that it is the duty of all mankind to cultivate peace. - « 

We may also hope.one'thing more, whi h ,'s, that even the despotic rulers
of foreign cggntries are becoming more and -more alive. to the duty of con-
sulting the Happinessr of their subjects. ~ '

1. Thergreater part of Africa has, from early times,i

been inhabited by savage or barbarous people, who had
no books, and no means of recording and preserving
their history- The only eountries—in Africa, of Which a
history has been preserved, are i Egypt, and the coun-
tries along the Mediterranean Sea. 0  

The ancients, as far back. as the time of the Romans, ——that is, about 2000 0

years ago,-_-— had some little knowledge of the interior of‘ Africa; but this
knowledge was slight, and throws no light upon its previous history,

HISTORY or ASIA. 15,1 

‘ It is‘ now about six thousand years since God made a man anda woman,
and placed them in. a beautiful .garden,.in Asia. Here he told them they

might live in peace, and happiness, if they would serve and obey him. But, '

unhappily, theychose to disobey him, and accordingly they were driven out
of . their beautiful garden, and obliged to support “themselves by the labor of
their hands‘. ' ' g ' . 1 . » «
The;children and descendants of Adam and Eve peopled the land, and
extended themselves into. various countries. _They became ‘very wicked,

~andGod sent a fe‘afrfu1 flood of waters ‘over the "world, and drowned them

all except Noah and his‘ family, who were saved in a great ship called an
ark. I .  . - y . ’
The‘ world was soon peopled -again by the’descendar1ts‘ of Noah. Some

‘of them went into various parts of Asia, some went into ‘Europe, and some

into Africa. Atwhat time the ﬁrst inhabitants .of7America -came into it we

The ﬂood, or wdeluge,..took pl-ace ab'out-165O years‘ after the“ world was
"created ;i that" is, ‘more‘- than 4000, years. ago. ‘The history of’ the Jews,
which is related" in the Old_Testament, is continued from - the time of’ Noah
nearly to‘the‘birth of our Savior,_which was about 1850’ years ago. ’ _» _ _ 
This history“ is full 'of"_inte're_st.‘ Aggrieat ‘part of the early ’history‘ of“aI-

inostv-all other nations’ is false; but';the' .~.-Biib*1e‘" ‘tells us nothing but What is

‘slew Goliatli, and irnaiiy other thin-gs -which youwill ﬁnd in the‘ Old Testa-

men’t,~'are in the highest degree‘ interesting ;’ ‘partly on account, of the ex-
traordinary nature of the events related, and partly on account of the bean-
tiful simplicity withwhich they are told". ~

2. The most interesting event, in the history of Asia,

He revealed to. them God’s will, his lasting dislike of wickedness,pand his
‘abiding love‘-of truth and goodness. He told them of the. punishment which
follows vice and the happiness whichattends virtue.‘ He also revealediis as
a matter of certainty, that another life, and one of endless duration, will
follow this; and ﬁnally died onthe cross, to atone for the sins of mankind. .

  3. The apostles of Christ spread his doctrines into
various parts {of Asia, Africa, and Europe. These
Were at first opposed, and the Christians Were many

of theme persecuted, and‘ some of the apostles, and many

thousands of ‘their followers, Were put to death on ac-

count of their religion. C A , ~ 7
Constantine, one of the _Roman emperors, at length espoused.Christianity;

and after. thatperiod its extension was rapid. It became permanently estab-
lished,’ and in due time was the prevailing religion, in Europe, and in many »

parts- of Asia a-ndi_Af'rica. , A p _ _ 4 a
By degrees a‘ system‘ grewjwup, called the "Roman Catholic religion-. At
the head" of this an oﬁicerwas’pla’ced,' called thespope, who resided at Rome,

.. in‘ Italy, and thus a succession of popes have come down to»o_ur time. Some
 ,j;»of' them have been verypowerfulg but the present pope of Rome -is. not su-
 perior, in wealth and power, to many of‘, the little sovereigns in Europe and

In modern times, the history of Asia presentsypa great variety of events;
but they would be of little interest to our youngreaders. We may, there-
fore, close our history of Asia by remarking that, from the earliest periods,

‘ i» this quarterof the world has exhibited a vast population, ruled ‘by despotic
' princes; and While they have claimed to rule by the authority of Heaven,

they have lived surrounded by luxury and pomp, at the same time that the
mass of the people have been poor and oppressed.

1. As this World is _a greatsphere or globe, there
are ‘ globes made ofiwood,vvithrpictures upon them rep-
resenting the land and Water, and the great mountains
and rivers, on the surface of the earth.     r r  

2. These are called art~y‘icz7al_ globes, and they give a

a Very correct idea of the shape of the earth, and the
situation of things upon it. But theyare expensive,
and every child cannot have one.  -e A .
'8. We therefore present tothe reader a globe map;
that is, a map which presents a picture of the surface
of the globe; and, if you will imagine it to be round,

like a; ball, itWillranswerinstead of an artiﬁcial globe.

4.. Byilookingatthis map, you Willsee that the sur-W

‘face of the earth°is divided intoland and Water. The

parts eiiclosed by the dark lines are land. You Will

gobservibe that there is more Water than land on the

s surfaceE,,:ofe the earth. :

5. The map of the Westerrn flemisip/tere, or Vvesterne
half of the earth, is to be considered as representing

~ ‘half the great globe or ball, on Which We live  andthe.
“ Eastern Hemisphere represents the other half.

them in different‘ parts of theworld, and some are Very

large.   n

2. The largest island in the world is New Holland,

or Australia. New Guinea, Borneo, New Zealand,

Madagascar, Cuba, and Greenland, are all large islands.
   Capes are points of “land extending into the sea.

The southern point of Africa is a cape, as well as that

of South‘ America.   —
4. A peninsula is a piece of land united to a conti-
nent by a narrowstrip, called an isthmus.

Lesson XVII.  Oceans, Seas,  &c.

1. If you will look on the globe map," you will see
that the water, on the surface of the earth, is one great
ocean or sea. It extends entirely around the earth, so

that you can sail quite round the globe in a ship.

2. To different parts of the ocean. we give different
names. One part is called the Paciﬁc Ocean; another
part is called the Atlantic Ocean; another part the In-
dian Ocean; one part the Nort/tern Ocean, and one the
Southern ‘Ocean. Thus there are ﬁve oceans.

 3. Tosmaller parts of the ocean we give the name

of sea; as the Caribbean Sea, Mediterranean Sea, &c.

4.  gal is a part of the sea running up into the
land; ;as, the Gulf of Mexico.  , ‘
5. A bayis also a part of the sea nearly enclosed by

land; as; Baflin’s Bay, Hudson’s Bay.

; 6. A ‘strait is a narrow strip connecting two portions
of the sea or ocean; as, Davis’s Straits, Bhering’s Straits.

LESSON XVII. ‘ 1.. Is the ocean all in one great sea ? Does the ocean extend
quite round the earth? Can you sail in a ship quite round the earth? 2. How

i do we distinguish different parts of the great ocean? Point out the Atlantic

IA great many Vessels go from Boston to China, to get
‘ tea and silks, and you will see the route they take, if

you will look on both sides of the globe map.

They ﬁrst go in a south-easterl y direction across the Atlantic Ocean, round .

the Cape ‘of’ Good Hope, across the Indian Ocean, between the two great
Islands of Sumatra and Java, turn to the north,‘ and at last arrive at Canton,
in China. Here may be seen strange-looking people, like these.

When the vessel is loaded with silks andtea, the captain wishes to come
back, and he can return the same way he went, if he pleases. But suppose
he chooses to take another route ; he can then cross the Paciﬁc Ocean, come

 

I round Cape Horn, and return to Boston. . The distance aroundithe World is

’ about twenty-four thousand miles, audit takes a vessel almost ‘a year to go

to China and back again. .. _ a =— .

natives,. take away their silver and gold, demolish their houses, and subject
them to a state of slavery.

They took possession of Cuba, and other West India Islands, which
were ﬁlled with people. Fernando Cortez went to Mexico, which was then
a great country with eight millions of inhabitants, and many large’ cities.

Cortez had but about 600 soldiers; but these had horses, cannon, _

swords, muskets, and pistols, a.nd the Mexicans had only spears, clubs, bows
and arrows. Cortez and his men seized the emperor of Mexico, put thou-
sands of his people to death, conquered the whole empire, and took a vast
amount of "silver and gold. P

Francis Pizarro, with less than 400 men, -went to Peru, which ‘was
more -populous and extensive than Mexico. He killed Atahualpa, the king,
slew his soldiers, and ravaged the whole country. The silver and gold,
that he obtained, amounted to many millions of dollars in value.

Thus the ﬁnest islands, and the two richest kingdoms, of America fell
into the hands of Spain. The oﬂicers of that power also seized upon
other portions of the New World, and Spain became the possessor of

the largest share of South America, and a considerable part of North f

America. .

England took possession of the coast of North America, at Virginia,
New York, New England, and other places, and the French seized upon
Canada, and the country along the Mississippi. 4. .

' Other European powers seized upon other parts, and thus, in the space

A of about a hundred years after America was discovered, it was parcelled

out between a variety of new owners. ’

The Indians had not wea.pons by which they could contend with the
white people, and so they were every where killed, driven away, or con-
quered. Some of the descendants of the Indians still exist, and probably
there are ten‘ millions of them all together, which is less than one half their
number in the time of Columbus. - '

In America there are now about forty millions of white people, and four
centuries ago there was not one white person in the whole continent.

' Since the first, settlement of America by white people, many interesting
events have occurred. Several great states have arisen, and now take rank
among the independent nations of the earth. We shall hereafter give a
brief history of these.

 The principal river of the United States the,

. Mississippi, and it is the longest in the World, being

about 4000 miles long. _Several large rivers ﬂow into
it, as the Missouri, the Ohio, the Red. River, &;c.
Many splendid“ fsteamboats go up and down the Missis-'

sippi and its branches.

 The great lakes of the north—West, such as Su-
perior, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, lie partly in the

United States, and partly in Canada. The St. Lavv-S

dividing Canada from the United States. ,  f

 In northern part of the United States, the
winters, areglong and severe ; in the Middle,States, they
are mild; . south,th,ere is seldom snow? or ice at

any season. In the Southern s States, cotton,ri-ce,sto-.

bacco, ‘ oranges, and ﬁgs are ' produced; in ‘the north,

these things will not grow, but wheat, corn, apples,

pears, and potatoes ﬂourish. Roses and lilachs arein
bloom. at New Orleans in February, yet they do not

blossom in Boston till nearly 0 four months after. a
t In the New England States, it is very common to see’ people in winter go
about on the snow, in sleds or sleighs ;‘ but such things are never seen in the

Weather, the want of food, clothing, and shelter. Many died of sickness

may well excite our admiration. ' "

Other settlers joined the New England emigrants, and in the space of a '

few years, Massachusetts,"Connecticut, N ew Hampshire, and Maine, were
dotted over with villages of White people. They had to ﬁght many battles
with the Indians; their houses were often‘ burned, and their families slain

much? later than the rest. Kentucky Was visited by a
bold hunter from “North Carolina, in 1769, named
Daniel Boone, and he established himself there, with

it his family, in 1775.

Boone was fond of the woods, andhe spent several months in Kentucky,
entirely alone, not another white man being west of the Alleghanies. i_ He
afterwards fought’ desperate‘, battles with the Indians, and performed many
wonderful feats. His name is fondly remembered, to this day, in Kentucky.

Ohio was ﬁrst settled in 1788, a little more than ﬁfty years ago, and now
nearly two millions of people are-Within its borders. The other Western
States have been settled at various recent periods. '

. At the time this War began, there were
thirteen - colonies in this country, all
under the government of‘ the king of
England. The whole number of people

' amounted to about three inillions. The
king and parliament taxed them unlaw-
fully, and treated them harshly.

they showed such signs of uneasiness,
that the king sent over many soldiers to
watch them. These were stationed at
Boston. But on the 19th of April, 1775,
they went up to Lexington and Concord,
to ‘destroy some ﬂour, meat, and other
things, belonging to the Americans. As
they _were coming back, the men came
upon them with their guns, and a terrible

Washington was a ‘brave man, very‘ good, and very wise; so he went to

In October, 1777, a British general, named Burgoyne, Was defeated at

and George Wasehington was the first president.

’ This constitution is a written contract between the people of the several
states; it gives to the president the command of the army and navy of the
Union, and requires him to Watch over the public good; to take care of the
interests of the nation, in War and peace. Congress are empowered to make

You will remember that, at the time of the revolution, the number of col-

When Pizarro Went to Peru, that country was ruled’ by an emperor-,_, ‘called
the inca. .His‘.dominions extended more than 2000 miles in length“, and
contained 12'millions‘of' people. Gold and silver were so abundantas to

be used for common utensils about the houses of the people. These Peru-
vians worshipped the sun, and had a great temple at Cusco, the capital of

the empire.

Pizarro captured the Peruvian emperor, and basely put him to death; he
then proceeded to conquer the country,~and’ rob it of its gold and silver.
Chili was soon after subdued, as Well as other portions of" South America.
These remained subject t'o«Spain for nearly 300 years; but they have all
recently‘ become independent. General"Bolivar, called the Liberator, for. his
noble achi'eveme‘nts in behalf of libe1‘ty,Was one of the chief instruments

month to go from Boston, or New York,.to Europe, and about a fortnight
for a steamship to perform the same voyage.

Theggiineral color of the sea near the shore is green, owing, probably, to
