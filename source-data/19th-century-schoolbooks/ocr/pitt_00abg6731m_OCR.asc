8 ‘ INTRODUCTION.

‘ ‘ it is such a quantity as comes from mixing six s-epa- "

rate pounds together. When We speak of four hours
of time, We mean‘ a duration four times longer than
one hour. ‘ - _ '

VI. In each of the above cases We compare the

, quantity spoken of with a quantity of the same kind,

Whose Value is known. This known value is call-

. ed the unit of t/ze quantity, and is one of the equal.»

parts of which the quantity is made up.

VII. -‘In the exarnplesabove, one foot is the unit
of the distance ten feet; one pound of tea is the unit
of the quantity six pounds of tea, and one hour the
unit of the quantity four hours of time. .

say three trees, the number three expresses three
things of the same kind: or if We say six pounds

of tea, We understand that the quantity six pounds

. RULE or THRE"«i'’lte,
{5 104. Ex. 1. If 1 yard of cloth cost‘ ~.

It is ‘plain that 6 yards of cloth, at the same rate
will cost 6 times as much as 1 yard,» and therefore,
the Whole cost is found by multiplying $2 by 6-
giving $12. for the cost. In this example there are

four numbers considered, viz. 1 yard of cloth, 6 yards‘ -

of cloth, $2 and $12: these numbers are called

terms. Three of‘ these terms were known or given

inthe question, and the other was to be found.
,1_yard of cloth is the 1st‘ term;
6 yards of cloth is the 2d term ;

$2 is the’ -. - - - 3d term; and
$12 isthe - - -, - 4th term.

 Now the 2d term 6 contains the ﬁrst term 1, 6
times, and the 4th term 12 contains the 3d'term 2, '

6. times——-that is_, the 2d term is as many times greater

t/tan t/te 1st, as t/Le 4172 term is greater thant/ze 3d.

8} 105. This relation between four numbers is call
ed geometrical proportion : and generally

Four numbers are in geometrical proportion, when
the 2d term is as many times greater or less than the
1st, as the 4th term is greater or less than the 3d.

’_ We express that four numbers are in proportion

thus :

. V . 1 : 6 : : 2 : 12 V

That is, we write the numbers in the same line
and place two dots between. the 1st and 2d terms,
four between the 2d and 3d terms, and two between
the 3d and 4th terms. We read the proportion thus,

as 1 is to 6,’so is 2 to 12.
The numbers 2 : 4 : : 5 V: 10 are in geometrical

proportion, since the 2d term is twice the 1st,‘ and .

the 4th term twice the 3d.

The 1st and 2d terms of a proportion always ex-
press quantities of the same hind, and so likewise do

' the 3d. and 4th terms. _ TAS in the first example.

 the cost of 1226 of tea.

It is’ evident that the 4th term, ‘orcost of 12lh of
tea, must be as many times greater than '$8,the cost
of 4ll2, as 12ll). is‘ greater than. 4.212. . Butsince the

quotient of'l2 divided by 4 expresses how many /

times 12 is greater than 4', it followsthat the fourth
term will be equal to $8 multiplied by thislquotient:

. that is, equal to 3;BS;1nultipliecl by 3,. or equal to $24.

But We obtain thesame result whether we multiply
the 3d term $8 by the quotient 3, or first multiply

' it by the 2d term and then dividethe produ_ct,by the

1st term; and thesame may be shown for every
proportion. Hence, we conclude,

§i106. That the fourth term of eiieryugeometrieal

3d terms together, and dividing their product by the

It is done thus, V e ' -~-» A ' - 100

 by Writing two ciphers on the right of 1. This num-

expresses 10 units of the second order, or one fann-

For example, in the number three hundred and
seventy ﬁve, there are 3 hundreds, '7 tens, and 5

‘ An improper fraction is one in which the nume-
rator is equal to, oriexceeds the denominator; as 3-,

— g, —;L,  Such fractions are called improper frac-

tions because they are equal to orexiceed unity.
When the numerator is equal tothe denominator the
value_of the fraction is 1 : in every other case ‘the
value of an improper fraction is greater than  ' ’

o ‘A simpZe_fmction is a‘ single expression; as 33-; 33-,
3, 3, &c. A~simple fraction may be either proper
or improper.

-A compound ﬁnction is a fraction of a fraction, or

several s-fractions connected together with the word

 All 125 NUMERATION AND NOTATION.

\ of the 1st.

I In the number four hundred and six‘, there are
units of the 3d order, 0 of the 2d, and 6 :52;

It is written -' 1 -= - -Q

§.10. To express ten units of the 3d order, orlone

‘ thousand, we form a new combination by‘ writing

three ciphers on the right of 1 ; thus A - ‘ 1000

Now, although this thousand“ expresses one thou-
-sandunits of the 1st order, it ~ is, nevertheless, but

' one single thousand, and may be regarded as a unit

of the 4th order. _ .

. Proceeding’ in this Way, w_e may place as "many
ﬁgures in a "row as Weiplease. ‘When so placed, we
conclude -: g V _ T ' _ V ,

1st. That the same figure has diﬁerent values ac-
cording to. the place which it occupies. '

2d. That counting from the right hand towards
the left, the first place is the place of units; the se-
cond, the place of tens ; thethird, the place of hun-
dreds ; the fourth, the place of thousands, c§~c. _

3d. That ten units of the first place are equal to _

one unit of the second place; that ten units of the

secondplace are equal to one unit of the third place ;*”'*

that ten units of the third place are equal to one unit

, of the fourth place ; and so on, for places farther to

the left. V .

'§ 11. Expressing numbers byﬁgures is called
NOTATION. Reading the order of. their places, cor-

‘ rectly, when written, is called NUMERATION. A

§113. A whole number may beexpressed frac-
tionally; Without altering its value, bywriting ,1. be-
low it for a denominator: thus,  may bewritten %,
5 may be Written -i-, 6 may be vvritten %, &c. ; when
so Written they are read 3 ones, 5 ones, 6 onaes, &c..

~§ 114. Since the denominator ofla fraction shows

into how many equal parts the unit has beer :l:ivi- .

(led, and the numerator how many of those ~..qual

parts are taken in the fraction § 57, the fracmm g W n

will express that the unit has been divided into 8
equal parts and that 5 of those parts are taken.‘ Each
part of the unit will beexpressed by 3} and 5 ofthose
parts by % X 5,: "hence g:-g, X 5. T In thegsame, Way

1 REDUCTIN OF DENOMINATE
  , FRACTIONS.

§ 132. We have seen § 71, that a denoniinate
number is one in which the kind of unit is denomi~
nated, or expressed. For the same reason, a deno-
minate fraction is one which expresses the /l:z'7zcZ of
unit that has been divided. Such unit is called the
unit of the fraction. Thus 35 of a 58 is a denominate

fraction. It expresses that one 58 is the ‘unit which i

has been divided, that this unit has been divided into
3 equal parts, and that 2 of these partshare taken in
the fraction. "

The fraction § of a shilling is also a denominate

a .<ih-illigng.i But one shilling is equal to. 3,17, of a

DIVISION OF’ VULGAR ‘FERACTIONS .

§ 153. We have seen {5 41, that division of inte- ‘

164 ~ DIVISION or i

For example, divide 1 apple into 4 equal parts.

Here it is-‘plain, that each part will be g ; orthat
the .dividend will contain the divisor but 41 times.

‘Again, divide :1, of a p.ear into 6 equal parts. It
is plain, that 1 will contain 6, -6% times; therefore 3’,
will contain 6 but.-1-15 times : hence 715 would be one
of the equal parts of‘ the pear.

§ 154.’.W.hen we divide a fraction by a Whole
number‘, we are to divide the fraction into as many
equal parts as there are units in the divisor, and this
may be done,’ as was shown in § 115, and §> 117, either

§ 169. Division of Decimal Fractions is similar to
that of simple numbers.
.'We have seen '\}.-47, that when there is no re;

produce the dividend. But when decimal fractions
are multiplied together there will be as many deci-

Here, the single apple is the unit, and the number ’

Addition is the uniting together of several num-

PRACTICE.

§‘182. Practice is a short, method of ﬁndingifhe
answers to questions in the Rule of Three, when the
ﬁrst term is unity. .
_ For example,  one yard of cloth cost half a dol-
lar, what will 60 yards ‘cost. This is a question
which may be answered by a rule called Practice.

If the cloth had been $1 per yard, the costof 60.

yards would have been $60; ‘but sincerit is only a

part, of a dollar per yard, the whole. cost Will be the

same part of $60, that -the cost. of A one yard is of 1

dollar ; that is —;-. Hence the cost is as of $60 ‘or $30.

{S .184. Interest is aniallowyance made for the use_
of money thatis bc '.uV.ed. , I 

For example, if I borrow $100 of Mr. Wilson,
for one year, and agree to pay him $6_for the use of
it, the $6 is called the interest of $100 for one year,‘
and at the end of thetime Mr. Wils.on should receive

back, his $100 together with the $6 interest, making
thetsurnof $10 . ‘

§ 185. The money on which interest is paid, is

‘ called the Principal. . -

,’ The money paid,'for the use of the principal is

_ called the -Interest.

The principal and interest taken togetherare call-
ed the Amount. , _ V ~ . v

In the above example, I

' $100 is the principal

1 $  is the interest and -
$106 is the amount. ' .

* The interest; of $10.0, or_ £100 for one year, deter- _

mines the per centage or ra,.t.e of interest. ‘ In the ex-

" ample above the rateof interest is 6 per cent. ; or $6 -.

, for the hundred. Had $8 been paid for the use of

the $100, the rate of interest would have been.8 per

’ cent. ; or had $33 only been paid, the rate of i,nt_e1'es.t

would have been 3,per cent. . _
In the New England States, and -indeed‘ in most

of the other states, the legal interest, that is, the rate

of interest established by law, is 6 per cent.
. In NeW*York, however,,it is 7 and in Louisiana

Itis plain, that -‘$100 is to $6, its interestfor‘ one

year, as $650 to its interest for the same time. The

fourth term is. found by multiplying the second and

third terms together and dividinrr by the ﬁrst, \§ 109.’

SIMPLE INTEREST." - 199

Since‘ in computing‘ interest the month. is always
reckoned‘ at 3.0 days, 60 days, Which‘ make 2 months,

will give an interest of one per cent. on the princi’- '

pal.’ » N0_w,_if;the interest at one per cent’. "(which is
the principal with the separating point removed two
places to the left,) be divided by 60, the quotient will
be the interest for 1 day, and thislquotient multiplied
by. the number of days will givethe interest required.
To divide. by 60 we remove the separating point one
place farther to the left, and then divide by 6.

SIMPLE NUMBERS. I [19

We then add the 1, 6, and 8 together, for the hun-
dreds, and ﬁnd the entire sum 1531_, as before.

- AWhen the sum in any one of the columnsexceeds
10, or an exact number of tens, the excess must be
writtendown, and a number equal to the number of
tens, added to the next left hand column.

This is called carrying to the next column. The
number to be carried may be Written under the co-
lumn or remembered and added in the mind. From
these illustrations-We deduce the following general '

RU LE .

V C} 16. I.- Set doion the numbers to he added so that '
{units shall be under units, tens under tens, hundreds
under hundreds, do. and draw a line beneath them.
II. Begin at the foot of the units column, and
add up the ﬁgures of that column.  the sum can

ilie expressed by a singleﬁgure, write it beneath the
Iiine, in the units place. But  it cannot, see how’
_jenany- tens and how many units it contains. Write
eiown the units in the units place, and carry as many

to the bottom ﬁgure of the second column as there were
stens in the sum.- Add up that column set down the

1 sum and carry to the third column as before.

III.‘ Add each ‘ columnin the same way, and set
down‘ the entire sum‘ of the last column. _

For example, suppose A puts $100 in trade for 5
yearé: B $200 for 2 years: and C $300 for one
year: this would make a c-ase of double. fellowship.

Now it is plain that there are two circumstances

which should determine each one’s share of the pro-

ﬁts : lst. the amozmt of capital he puts in ; and 2dZy,
the t2'me_u'hz'c_h it is co7ztz’nued in the bu-siness.
Hence each one’s share should be proportional to
the ‘capirtali he puts in, multiplied by the time it is
contihueed intrade. Therefore We haVe,th'e'f'ol1oWing

this note. is made payable, writes hi_s name on the back of it,
he is said to endorse thenote, and he is called the endorser; and
when the note becomes due, the holder must ﬁrst demand
pay1_ne__n__t of the maker, Reuben Holmes, and if he declines
paying it, the holder may then require payment or Abel

_ Bond, the endorser-  ‘ -

4. If the note is madepayable to A B, or bearer, then the
drawer alone is responsible, and -he must pay to any person
who holds the note. V i , . —

LEGER,

The Leger is‘a. book into which is OQ1.lected, in a. condensed
form, all the scattered accounts from the Day Book.

-Two columns should be ruled on the rightiof each page of
the Leger, one for dollars ‘and one for cents ; there ‘should
also bestwo columns on the left, one to insert the date of the

— transaction, and the other for inserting the page of the Day
' Book from which the account is transferred. " ‘

5I’~wg,pg,ges the Leger, facing eachother, are generally
used ‘in stating an account, though so_.met'imes a page is divi-

died into tyyg. equal parts, in vyhichcase ea_c_l1 part may be
p kconlsidered as ‘forming a separate page, The name of the per-
’.,s_on Withwhom thelaccount is stated should bewiji-tten_, 

large letters at the top of the left hand page. —e ..
The D,ebi.,ts_are entered on the left hand page,’ and the

~Qredits on the other page dige_CtlylQppQsij;,e:._ H';[‘he diﬁ‘e1ve;1Qg
between the -debits and c_redits,_ is always enteredpunder the

least sum, when the account is closed.,, and is called the balg

_ ance, as_ in the a.ccount of John McNeil1. ‘

At the top of the left hand column, We enter the year,
ungler Which, We enter the day of the month on which the
rarxsaption took place ;. and in the adjoining column‘, we en-

- terlhe page of’th_e' Day B001; from.vyhich' the account is

transferred‘. _ V

When there are several articles charged in the Day Book,
we need not specify, them all, but may enter them in the Le-
ger under the generalname of*“ Sundries? Having‘ posted
the account,VWe enter the page of the Leger to which it has
been transferred, in the left hand col-umn of the. Day Book
and opposite the account, and make a inaiflg X to catch the
eye and showthat thefaccount is posted. 7 i
s "We begin,.posting”with the account of George Wilson,
who stands- charged on the Day Book With‘ $l12,2_0. Having
posted the first charge, we run the eye carefully through the
[Day Book, to seeif there are anytother charges against him,
and ﬁnd -that in page 2 he is credited by 100 dollars cash, and

a note for  1, These items we enter in the Leger, on

the credit side, and as the debits and credits are equ~’al=,: his

ii’aézep'unt is balanced. We proceed in the s‘an1e’Vvay to post

LEGER. it 267

all the accounts entered in the Day Book. No erasures
should ever be made in the account ‘books. When an error
is discovered, if it be in favor of the customer he should be
charged with the amount, and if against him, he should be
credited with the amount. In posting the account of Jared
Newton, a. mistake was made against him of $2136, which
was rectified by crediting him with the amount. V -
When a charge is entered on the wrong side of the book,
as when a person is charged with thatfor which he ought to

. have been credited, twice the amount must be entered on the

other side of the bookto make the account right.

Every Leger should have an Index, where the names of
all persons, who have accounts in the Leger, should be .ar-..
ranged in alphabetical order. ’ ’

When a Leger is ﬁlled, all ‘the accounts arc"bafan,ced, and I

when we transfer the‘ balances to a new?Leger-, we charge

« A eonnncr and accurate knowledge of Arithmetic is one
of themost important elements of aliberal or practical edu-
cation. The public should, therefore, receive with indulgence
every attempt that may be made to improve this department
of instruction. ’ '

 

The Elementary Treatise, which is here presented, has

been prepared with care, thoughthe author by no means in.
dulges the belief that it is free from faults. He has endeav.
ored to render the subject as plain as it is capable of being
made, and, at the same time, to treat it as brieﬂy as possible.

The ‘reasons for most 7of' the rules are given. It Was not,
however, thought best to demonstrate the rules for the ex.-
traction of roots, nor that for ﬁnding the sum of a geometri-
cal series. . -

The name, Compound Numbers, vvhieh has heretofore
been given to all numbers in which the kind of unit is ex.
pressed, has been changed to that of Denominate Numbers.

This change has not been made with any ambitious spirit of '

innovation, but because it is deemed an improvement. . It is
not easy to form an idea ofwhat is meant by the term, Com»
pound Number, and especially so,«When We ﬁnd it applied to
such numbers as £3; $53, 38. VVhy is £3 a compound num.
ber any more than 3 ? If it be ansWered,‘that £3 is composed
or compounded of three single pounds, that does not remove
the difliculty, for 3 is also composed of three units 1. Is
it not then the better Way to call/the ﬁrst a denominate num.
her, and the other a simple number, as is done in 4} 71.

Mr. Hasler, in his Arithmetic, has called this class of
numbers, Denominate Fractions. ’ p
Some of the examples in the Rule of Three,,and most of
those at the end of the book, have been selected from Huteg
ton’s and Wall{i11game’s Arithmetics.

A ' Setting down the 3 in the quotient, and multiply-
ing the divisor by it, we -get 981, which being less
than 1177, the quotient figure is not"too great: We

— subtract 981 from the first four ﬁgures of the divi-
‘ dend, and ﬁnd a remainder" 196, which being less

than the divisor, the quotient ﬁgure is not too small.
Annex toathis remainder the next -ﬁgure 2, of the
dividend. ' ‘

As 3 is contained in 19, 6 times, We conclude that

the divisor is contained in 1962 as many as 6 times.
Setting down 6 in the quotient and multiplying the
divisor by it, We find the product to be 1962. There--

fore the entire quotient is 36, or the divisor is con.- "

tained 36 times in the dividend.

DEEEGNSTRATION OF THE RULE.‘
If 6 simple units be divided by 3, the quotient‘-

‘ 1 , will be 2. If 6units of the 2d order, or 60, be di-

vided by 3,. the quotient Will be 2 tens,or 2 units of’:
the 2d order. If 9 hundreds, or 9 units of the 3d’.

~ order bedivided by 3, the quotient will be 3 hun-4

dreds, or 3 units of the 3d order. —

So, in general,  ‘units of any order be divided by!
simple zmits, the units of the qu‘otz'e7zt will be ‘ﬁllet’
same order as those of the dividend. V -

When in the last example it was 327).11'77Q(3‘3'?§

required to divide 11772 by 327, 981
We first considered, as Wehad a "“““‘19-Gé"-_
right to do, that 11772 is made up » 1962‘-

of 1177 tens and 2 units. We then‘!

divided the tens by the divisor 327, and foVundi*3 tenes A

for the quotient, by which we-multiplied the divisor“

-and subtracted the product from 1177,‘ leaving'a.re-~-
i mainder of 196 tens. To this number Wé‘b1'0l1gl1t7~

down the 2 units, making 1962"units. '_I‘his nu_m-'»~—

. When the unit of the ﬁrst number which contains
the divisor is of the 3d order, or 100, there willbe 3
ﬁgures in the quotient; when it is— of the 4th order
there will be 4, &c. ‘

Hence, the quotient -found according to the rule,
expresses the nurnber of times which the dividend
contains the divisor, and consequently is the true
quotient. ‘ I

is called one fourtiz.

If the uni_t be divided into 12 equal‘ parts, eachwl

part is called one twelfth; and when it is divided

The {,—, A,-‘3—, -3-, &c. are called fractions.

§ 5'7. Each fraction is made up of two numbers;

the number which is Written above the line, is called
the numerator ; and the one below it is called the
denominator because it gives a denomination or
name to the fraction.

For example, in the fraction g, 1 is the numera-

tor, and 2 the denominator. -In the fraction 3}, 1 is‘

the numerator, and 3 the denominator. ,
"T/ze denominator in every fraction skews into
lzowmany equal parts tire unit’ or single ‘thing, is

A divided. For example, in the fraction g, the unit

is divided into 2 equal parts; in the fraction %, it is

"divided into 3 equal parts; in the fraction %, it is di-

vided into 4 equal parts,‘&c. In each of the frac-
tions one of the equal parts is expressed. But sup-
pose it were required to express 2 of the equal parts,
as 2 halves, 2 thirds, 2 fourths, &c. '

We should then write, '

-’ - two ﬁfths, &c.

If ’ it were required to express three of the equal
parts, we should place 3 in the numerator; and ge-
nerally, t/ze numerator shows how manyof tlze equal
parts are expressed in tlze fraction.

T T T For example, three eighths‘ are Written,

—§,i and read three eeighths.

53 e- - four ninths. ’
7°-5 - - - six thirteenths.
E93 -t - nine twentieths.

{5 58. the numerator and denominator are

equal, "the numerator expresses all the equal parts '
, into which the unit has been _divided : therefore, the

value of the fraction is equal to 1., But if We sup-

‘T pose a second unit, of the same kind, to be divided
into the same number of equal: parts, those parts may
_ also be expressed in the same fraction. with the parts

of the first unit. Thus, ’ - ~

g is read / three halves. V
.;,"—. - _, - seven fourths. _
13° - - sixteen ﬁfths. ’

The denominator of the ﬁrstfraction, shows that

' a unit has been divided into 2 equal parts, and the __

numeratorexpresses that three suchparts are taken.

a Now, two of the parts make up one unit, and the re-

maining ‘part comes from‘ the 2d unit: hencethe

‘value of the fraction is 154;» that is, one and one half.
The denominator of the second fraction shows that.

a, unit has been divided into four equal. parts, and
the numerator expresses that 7 such parts are taken.
Four of the '7 part_s come from one unit, and the re-
maining 3 from a second unit: the value of the frac-

tion is therefore equal to 17}; that is, to one and

three-‘fourths. In the third fraction, the unit has

been divided’ into‘5‘ equal parts, and 16* such parts"

are taken. Now, since each unit has been divided
into 5 parts, 15 of the 16 parts'makeJ3 units, andthe

remaining part is 1 partofsa fourth. unit. There-'

- §62. As dimes are tens of cents, the second line
may either be read 16 centsand 4 mills, or 1 dime
6 cents and 4 mills. And as the eagles are tens of
dollars the third line may he read 62 dollars and
12 cents, or 6 eagles 2 dollars and 12 cents.

Federal money is generally read, in dollars, cents, '

and mills.

§ 63. From the first of the tables it appears,

a__.-1st. That cents may be changed into mills by an-
ne:z:z'ng_,a cipher. «

Thus, 8 cents are equal to 80 mills.

2d. That dollars may be changed ‘into cents by
annexing two ciphers, and into mills by annexing

three. ‘

For example, 12 dollars are equal to 1200' cents,
or to 12000 mills.“ The reasons of these rules are
evident, since 10 mills make a cent, 100 cents a-dol-
lar, and 1000 mills a dollar.

A   RULE-
Cut 517‘ the‘ right lzancl ﬁgure for mills, tlze two

next ﬁgures for cents, and Z/ze remainvlng left hand _

ﬁgn7'es,wz'll be dollars. ' I » s
The reason of the rule is this : by cutting off the
ﬁrst right hand ﬁgure, We in fact‘, divide by 10, and

l thus reduce the mills to cents. Then by cutting off

the next two ﬁgures, We divide‘ by 100; and thus

reduce the cents to dollars.

. The comma,‘ or separatrix, is generally used to
separate the mills from the‘ cents, and the cents from
the dollars. Thus, $6'7,25,6 is read 67 dollars 25
cents and 6 mills. ’ , ‘

or DENOMINATE NUMBERS.

{S 70. Simple numbers express a collection of units
of the same kind, without expressing the particular
value of thepunit. For example, 40 and 55 are sim~
ple numbers, and the unit is 1, but it is not express-
edwhether the unit is 1 apple, 1 pound, or 1 ho_rse.

8371. A denominate number expresses the mm;
of unit which is considered.» For example, 6 yards
of cloth is a denominate number, the unit, 1 yard of"
cloth, being denominated, or named. a ' *

$3 72. When two numbers have the same unit, they
are said to be of the same denomination: and when

two numbers have different units, they are said to

be of different denominations. T _

For example, 8' feet and 10 feet are of the same
denomination, the unit being 1 ‘foot; but 30 feet and
60 yards are of different denominations, the unit of A

the ﬁrst being 1' foot, and the unit of the second, 1

yard.

Several denominate numbers, of ‘different denomi-
nations, are often connected together, forming a
whole; as 3 feet 6 inches; 9 dollars 6 dimes and '7
cents. In the ﬁrst, 1 foot is the unit of3 feet, and 1

inch, the unit of 6 inches; and in the ‘second, 1 dol- 

lar is the unit of 9 dollars, 1 dime the unit of 6 dimes,
and 1 cent the unit of 7 cents.

The following Tables show the different kinds of
denominate numbers in general use, and also their
relative values.

ENGLISH MONEY.

§73. The denominations. of English Money, are 1
guineas, pounds, shillings, pence, and. farthings.
