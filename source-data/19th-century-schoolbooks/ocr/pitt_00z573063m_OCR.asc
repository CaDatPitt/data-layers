the systems, hitherto pursued, in arran-
ging books of Geography for Schools,
are -aunphilosophical, and ill, adapted
to the purposes of education, that an
entire revolution on this subject may
be predicted: as certain. The prev-
alent plan is to teach ﬁrst, that which
is most difiicult; the plan we propose,
is t.o teach, ﬁrst, that which is most
easy; the common.rule, is to begin
with grand or remote topics,--—as the
revolutions of the heavenly bodies——
with comprehensive views of the four
divisions of the Earth—-—and proceed
from these great themes, to those which
are more familiar, ‘We would reverse
this method; to use a common phrase,
we would begin at the other end. VVe
Wculrl begin at homo-—teach the Geogra-
phy‘ first of the School Room, then of the
Village, or Town, -in which the pupil
resides, then of the County, the State,
&.c. VVe would begin with things,
known and familiar, and proceed from
these objects, to embrace in the grad-
ually extending circle of knowledge,
the entire Globe.

We have seen, with some regret, the
opposition which has been arrayed
against these views, but it cannot cer-
tainly be of long endurance. No work
on a subject like this, be it either new
or old, can long, withstand the force of
common .sense;- but we deem it very
desirable for the cause i’ education,‘

PREFACE.

that the old system be speedily aban-
doned. The Author has therefore Writ-
ten this humble work,‘in the hope that
the obvious advantage of the principles
upon which it is constructed, may be
commended to Parents" and Teachers,
and that they all may adopt a more
rational, easy, and sure method of
teaching Geography, than has been
generally pursued.

Remarks similar to_ these would,
doubtless, apply with equal justice to
other subjects of school instruction;
but Geography being a more universal
study, than any other, and being, at the
same time, one of the most useful, it is
more important to correct mistakes re-
specting this, than most other branches
of education.

VVe have but one more observation

to make, and that is, that we claim,

not to be the inventors of the method
of instruction, here recommended and
adopted. This system depends upon
principles long since inculcated in
Europe, and which the Author saw
practically applied in schools there,
several years ago. These principles
are now extensively diffused among
Parents and Teachers in this country,
and the Author desires no more, than
to be considered a participator in the
efforts, that are making to impart their

beneﬁts to the rising generation.

south from the Equator; and that longitude is dis-
tance east or west from Greenwich or Washington.
Let him understand that latitude and longitude
are both measured by degrees, and that each degree
contains nearly 70 miles. When he understands
these subjects, let him be asked the following
questions.

REMARKS TO PARENTS AND TEACHERS. 7

THE principal diﬁiculties in teaching Geog-
aphy, are encountered in the beginning.
When the pupil is once started,‘ his progress
is more easy and rapid. The following
method is recommended, and its adoption,
we believe, will remove much of the labor
usually required on the part of both teach-
er and pupil.

First, teach the points of the compass, as
follows.‘ Tell the pupil which way is north,
east, south, west. Then, ask him which is
the north side of the room he is in; which is
the east side; &c. Then, which way he
goes to school; which way from school;
which way to church or meeting; which -way

to his grandfather’s, or uncle’s, or any other

person’s house he is familiar with; which
way to the next town or any other place
he is accustomed to visit.

Second, give some idea of distance and ex-
tent. Ask him how far it is from the school-
house to his home, to the meeting-house, or
any other place, which he is acquainted with.
Ask him several questions of this kind until
he knows what a mile is. Then teach him,
that a square mile is a space measuring a
mile on each side; it is a piece of ground
which would take him a full hour to walk
around.

Third, teach the principal geographical fea-
tures of the town where the pupil is. Direct his
attention to the hills; let him tell their shape,
name, distance, direction from the church,
in what part of the town they are. _ Direct
his attention to the mountains, if any, and let
him "tell their appearance, extent, names,
situation, distance, direction, &c.i Let him
describe the rivers, tell their course, width,
direction, situation, where they flow to, if
boats oar steamboats go upon them; if
there are ﬁshes in them, &c. 7
scribe the valleys; the forests; the lains; in
short, ask the pupil questions of all the strik-
ing olrieets in the place; houses, meeting-
nouses, or churches; school-houses, and

Legevhim de-1.7

other public ediﬁces. Let these questions be
so framed, that the answers of the child put
together, may form a description of these
objects. Let the questions be simple, and
where they pupil’s knowledge is deﬁcient,
the Teacher should supply the deﬁciency
Fourth, teach the pupil what a town or city
is. Direct his attention to the houses, roads,
churches, lands, hills, valleys, &c. which con-
stitute the town. Tell him, that as he has
two hands, two eyes, two ears, and two legs,

and altogether, they make one boy, called‘

George, or Peter, so all these objects Form
one town called Hartford, or Boston, or
Worcester. Then furnish the pupil with a
rough map of the town, showing its shape,
the rivers, streets, roads,"hills and valleys; A
mere pencil sketch will do. Let the pupil
copy this. 3

Fifth, teach what a county is. Te? the
pupil that a county contains several tqwns;
a state several counties, &c. Then gisie the
pupil a rough sketch _of the county, then show
him the map of his own state, in this book,
and let him answer the questions upon it.

It will not perhaps be necessary to  véry
thorough in teaching the pupil all these
things at first. It will be sufficient to give a
class two or three lessons, on the foregoing
topics, the pupil may then commence, with
the following page. As he proceeds in his
lesson, he will meet with the subjects nam-
ed above. ' He may then be interrogated as
we have proposed; for instance, svhen he is
asked how Maine is bounded on the north,
let him tell which side of the room is north.
When he is asked about the mountains
in Maine, let him describe a mountain;
ﬁéfhell he is asked about rivers, let him de-
 a river &c.

1 sulrosn all my littlereaders have heard
of Peiter Parley. He lives in Boston, and
thou h he is old, gray and lame, yet he is
very-‘cheerful, and very tbnd of children;

.he loges to have them come and see him,

and lkes great delight in telling them sto-
ries. He has been about the world a great
deal; sometimes he has travelled on foot,

and sometimes he has sailed in a ship over

the sea to distant countries.

But although Mr. Parley loves to tell sto-
ties, and takes great pleasure in amusing
his little friends, yet he is more anxious to
teach them something useful. He is very
i'ond»of telling about towns and cities, and
rivers and islands, and mountains and lakes,

and the blue sea upon which ships sail.

He will sometimes, lead the children about
Boston, lame as he is, and explain to them
every thing that they see. Sometimes he
gets into a wagon, with two horses and
four or ﬁve children, and goes all around the
country about Boston. When he gets upon
a hill, he shows the children the rivers,
towns, bays, and all the other things which
are to be seen, he tells them the names of
all these objects, he tells them what a river
is, what a town is, what a bay is, and many
other things; this, Mr. Parley calls teaching
Geography. See him at the top of this
page, with his little school travelling about
in a Wagon!

This is certainly a pleasant method of

learning about towns and cities, and rivers,

and mountains, and I wish all my little
readers could learn geography in this way;
by this I mean, that instead of reading about
countries, I wish they could travel, and see
the hills and valleys and towns and rivers
and other things. Nothing indeed is more
delightful than to travel. Sometimes you
will meet with a beautiful river foaming and
dashing over the rocks; then you will meet
with another river which is broad and
smooth, with boats and vessels sailing upon
it. Sometimes you will meet With a quiet
little village, where the people are all farm-
ers, and where the children, may be seen
scampering about, among the lambs and

sheep, in the beautifulgreen ﬁelds.

of houses, with a multitude of carts and
coaches and carriages oi all sorts, where
all is noise and hustle, and where the shops
are ﬁlled with beautiful toys, pictures, and
excellent little books for children. Some-
times you will have to climb a mountain,
covered with Woods, then you will descend
into a valley between the mountains or hills,
where you will ﬁnd, meadows, and ﬁelds
of grain. By and by you will come to a
manufacturing town, where there are large
buildings, with a great many windows, and
full of machinery for making cotton and

Woollen cloths: sometimes you will meet

with the splendid houses of rich people,
with groves and gardens around them, and
again, you will meet with the houses of
the poor, whose little children have often
hardly enough to eat.

All these and many more interesting
things you will meet with in travelling. I
say therefore it is very pleasant to travel
about and see the world, but as very few
of us can spend our time in this way, I am
going to make a little book, in which I shall
tell you of the things you will see in travel-
ling about the country. I shall not have
room to tell you of all that can be seen, but
I will endeavor to give you an account of
those things that are most‘ interesting; 1
will tell you of the largest rivers and the
loftiest mountains, and the widest lakes, and
whatever else may seem most likely to
please you. When I am about to describe
a country, I shall in the ﬁrst place show
you a map or picture of it. After studying
this a little you will know its shape and
situation, where the principal towns, moun-
tains, rivers and lakes are, and many other
things; after you have learned all this I
shall then proceed to tell you something
more. I shall often request you to fancy

that you are travelling with me, and actu-

I ally see the interesting objects which are

described.

STATE 01'' MAIl\’F'

1. You have now looked over the map
of Maine, and you know its shape, its moun-
tains, lakes, rivers, islands. shores, and bays.
You know also its counties, the names of the

rincipal towns, and where they are situated.
£7011 know a good deal about Maine therefore,
but I have still much more to tell you.

2. I will ﬁrst tell you about that dark
line of mountains that runs along the north-
western border of the state. These moun-
tains appear on the map like little specks, not
larger than ﬂies; but if you were to go
there you would ﬁnd some of them very
lofty; it would take you a whole day to
climb to the top of one of them. Some of
them appear like vast heaps-of naked rock;
others are covered with gloomy forests, a
few people live along the skirts of these
mountains, but most of them are inhabit-
ed only by wolves, bears, deer, and other
wild animals. If you were to spend the
night there, you would be obliged to sleep
in some cave, or stay in the open air. ‘When
it was all dark around you, you would hear

the bowling of wolves, and perhaps the cry

of a Wild cat, or a lynx.

3. I will now tell you about the rivers
in Maine. The Kennebec and Penohscot
are Very large rivers, they appear like little
threads on the map, but they are in fact sev-
eral hundred miles in length; and near the
sea they are so broad that many steamboats
and vessels sail upon them. .

4. Do you know how a river is made?
I will tell you. You know that. if you pour
water on the side of a bill, it will run down
to the bottom. VVell, the rain falls upon the
hills; and the waters pour downthe sides,
and are collected in the valley at the bottom.
Here they form a pond or lake. Now a pond
or lake is like a bowl of water; if you put in
too much, the water will runover; so, after a
time, the valley having more Water than it can
hold, some of it ﬂows out, and winding its way
among the hills, forms a little stream or river.

5. At first it rushes along very swiftly, it
leaps, and bounds, and foams, and seems as
wild and noisy as a boy just let out from

surface a multitude». of boats and vessels.

6. Are you fond of travelling? I have
no doubt you are, so let us enter a stage and
proceed to Augusta, in Maine. Here we must
get a boat and make a trip up the Kenne-
bec. As we sail up the river, we shall see
some pleasant villages on its banks; but aﬁer
three or four days, we shall find the land
covered with thick woods on both sides. We
shall however meet a good many rafts of
timber ﬂoating down the stream. Here isa
picture of one of these rafts.

 

7. You see it consists almost entirely of
logs, which are taken out of the river and
sawed into boards. The thick forests of
Maine furnish abundance of pine, and other
trees, which are made into boards, shingles,
staves for casks, 820. These ar,[iC,l(%fS~ fare

houses. I think it very likely that the house
my little reader lives in, is built in part, of
boards and shingles that came from Maine.

.8. But We must proceed on our jour-
ney. Having ascended the Kennebec, we
shall at length arrive at a large and beautiful
sheet of Water called Moosehead Lake; this
is the source of the Kennebec; very few
people live near it, but we shall notice a
great many water birds here ; there are wild
ducks, bitterns and herons, some of the latter
having legs as long as a boy. These dwell
around the lake, and though they appear to
be very solitary, yet they are no doubt very
happy; here they rear their young ones, but
when Winter is coming, they all fly away,
and do not return until spring.

9. When we have remained a few days
at the lake and caught aplenty of ﬁsh, we
must travel on foot through the woods to the
Penobscot River. Here we must build a
raft of logs and ﬂoat down the stream. Vlfe
must be very careful, or we shall be dash-
ed over some of the rapids and drowned.

I0 I We shall ﬁnd the Penouscot a very
large river, and when we have come With-
in forty miles of its mouth, we shall meet
with an island inhabited by about three hun-
dred Indians. These people live a miserable
Kind of life; they have very poor houses,
made of boards, and I am sorry to say that
some of them are very intemperate. Here

a blanket you see, and is talking with a young
man about these Indians who are called the
Penobscot tribe.

11. After leaving the Indian. settlement,
which. is called Ind'ian Old Town, we had bet-»
ter dismiss the raft, get into a good boat, and
sail down the river. By and by, We shall:
enter Penobscot Bay, which has not less than
three hundred islands in it. After sa.il»ing in
this beautiful bay we shall land at Belfast, and
travel across the country to Portland. We
shall ﬁnd this to be a large town almost equal
to Providence or Salem. It is the largest
town in Maine and has many handsome-
buildings in it. y

]2. I could tell you a great deal more of
this interestingystate; the people of Maine
catch a great many fish, in the rivers and
along, the shore; and, if I had room, I could

. tell you many pleasant stories about catch-

ing he1'1'ing, salmon, shad, and other ﬁshes.
The people of Maine have also a great many
vessels, fwhich carry their ﬁsh and lumber
to all parts of’ America. There are many
pleasant towns too in the Southern part
of the state, which I should like to des-
cribe, such as Uardiner, where there is a very
beautiful cliumh; BrunsWick,_where there is
a ﬁne college; and Augusta, VVll€l'8 the people
are building a Very handsome State House.
I should like also to give you an account of
the northern parts of Maine, which are yet
covered with forests, and where there are?
a great many wild animals, but all these
things you must read about in some larger
book.

13. In summer it is warm and pleasant
in the state of Maine, but in winter it is ex-
ceedingly cold ; the rivers and lakes are then
frozen over and the ground is covered with

-—-n.——

1. As you now understand the map of
this state, we will travel about and see if
there is anything interesting in it. Let us
suppose that we are in Portsmouth. This
is the largest town in New Hampshire, and
it is a very handsome place. Wepgﬁshall see
many ﬁne houses here, and in the harbor we
shall notice a good many ships. These are
sent loaded with ﬁsh, lumber, cotton goods
and other things, to various parts of the world,
and bring back sugar, molasses, coffee, or-
anges, lemons, cloths‘and a multitude of
other articles. Thus you see the people send
away such things as they do not  and
get in return such things as they, do Want.
This is called Commerce.

2. VVhile We are at Portsmouth, We had
better get a boat, ‘ands pay has to meiisies

these Islands, and spend?'~r.;,,.;  er Whole life iii,

ﬁshing. They go out upon the water in little
vessels, and having caught a good many cod-
ﬁsh, they carry them to the islands and dry
them on the rocks; they then send them
to Boston, or some other market for sale.
While we are on these islands we may per-
haps get a sight of‘ the Sea Serpent. He is
said to be as large as the mast of a ship, and
has frequently been seen, along the shores of
New England. Here is a picture of him.

3. Having returned to Portsmouth we
will get into the stage and travel through
Exeter, and Dover, to Concord. At Exeter
there is a ﬁne Academy, Where boys are
taught grammar, Latin, Greek and other
things. At Dover there are a great many
manufitctories. These are situated on a lit-
tle rivetff called Cocheco, This river you
Will see marked on the map, but the name of
it is not put down. The menu factories con-
sist of a great many very lofty buildings with
a multitude of Windows. The water of the
river comes pouring over the rocks in a ﬂood
and turns the Wheels of the manufactories.

 

;j1‘l1ese Wheels set the machinery in motion

wool are ﬁrst spun into threads, and then

the picture? 3. What of Exeter? Dover?
Describe the manufactories. How many yards of

woven into cloths. There are a great many
men, women and children in these buildings.
If you go into one of them you will be aston-
ished at the busy scene. One of these fac-
tories makes 100,000 yards of cotton cloth
in a single week. This cloth is carried to
Boston, New York, Philadelphia and other
places. It is bought by the merchants and
then sold to the people. It is very probable
that some of the clothes worn by my little
readers are made of cloth manufactured at
Dover.

4. We shall at length reach Concord; this
is a pleasant town, but not so large as Ports-
mouth. We shall notice a handsome stone
building here called the State House. In this
building, some of the people meet every year
to make laws for the state; they are called
the Legislature.

5. We will now make a trip to the VVl1ite.

Mountains. ’ A great many people go there
every year from Boston, New York, and
other places. It is very interesting to travel
among these lofty mountains.

6. In our journey from Concord We shall
observe that New Hampshire is a very hilly
state, but many of the hills are covered with
fine pasture, and you will see a great many
sheep and cattle upon them. The people

who live among the hills in New Hampshire
are very happy. It is quite cold there in
winter, but they build up large ﬁres and keep
themselves warm. In the spring they plough
their ﬁelds, and in June they Wash their sheep
in a brook or river, so as to make the wool
glean. It is very pleasant to see the people
washing their sheep. _

7. VVe shall soon see the blue tops of the
VVhite Mountains, and after travelling at long
time, we shall begin to ascend them. After
climbing over hills, and rocks, and Winding

through valleys, we shall come to What is

called the Notch. This is a deep place be-
tween two high mountains. Here there is
a small house, and a man by the name of
Willey used to live in it. But a dreadful ac-
cident happened to him and his family a few
years ago.‘ One day they heard a greaanoige,
and ran out of the house to see what candied
It. To their great amazement, a large part
of the mountain was falling directly tovgaids

escape, but in vain; the rocks and stones

by we shall come to Mt. Washington. This
is the tallest mountain in -this part of our
country. It is 6634 feet high. It is very dif-
ficult to go to the top of it, but if my little
friends have good courage, they will be able
to get up, with some help.

9. Here vsge are then, at the top of Mt.
Washington. What a glorious prospect is
before us! Hills, valleys, lakes, rivers, towns,
villages, all spread out to view! What an
excellent place to study Geography. To the
east we can see Portland in Maine. It is a’
great many miles off; and it looks like a
speck in the distance. To the west are
the Green Mountains in Vermont, and far
to the south is the blue top of old Monad-
g11OCl{.

lakesand rivers; how many insects dancing
in the sunbeams.

11. But We must soon leave this interest-
ing spot. On our return we must-not fail
to visit Lake VVinnipiseogee, which is one of
the most charming Lakes in the world. On
the whole we shall be delighted with New
Hampshire.

12. If we were to travel to?‘ the northern
part of the state, We should ﬁnd the country
covered with thick woods, and should see

STATE OF VERMONT.

1. We will now make a journey through
Vermont. We will begin at Brattleboro.
This is a busy little town situated on Con-
necticut river, and surrounded by mountains
and hills. It is a charming place, and you
will be sorry to leave it.

2. We will take the stage and proceed in
a northerly direction. Our road leads over
steep hills, through deep valleys, and across
noisy little rivers. The country is so hilly,
that a man once told me as a reason why they
did not have a turnpike road here, that no
place could be found Where a turnpike gate
would stand; but this was only a joke.

3. As we proceed We shall frequently
have a View of Connecticut river, and per-
haps we may catch a glimpse of a little
steam-boat upon it.

 

We shall by and by, after travelling about
twenty miles, come to a more level country.
The road winds along the bank of the Con-
necticut, and nothing can be more delightful
than this part of our journey. VVe shall at
length reach Bellows Falls; here is a high
bridge upon which we can stand and see the
river tumbling over the rocks beneath us.
The water whirls, foams, and roars, in a ter-
rible manner.

4. After leaving the falls we shall proceed
to Windsor. This is a very pleasant town,
situated near the river. At the distance of
three or four miles, is a tall mountain called

cutney ? What may be seen from the top of Mount
Ase-utney to the south? VVhat to the west? ,

Q3?

,What shall we pass on the lake? 8.

l7

Aseutney; we must go to the top of it where
we shall ﬁnd a beautiful little lake. ‘We
shall also be able to see in every direction to
a vast distance. To the south we shall see
Connecticut river, Winding its way through
the Valley, with lofty hills on each side and
pleasant villages scattered along its banks.
To the West, we shall see the Green moun-
tains covered with forests and spreading over
the country, as far as the eye can reach.

5. \Ve will now take the stage and pro-
ceed ‘across the mountains to Middlebury.
Here we shall ﬁnd a handsome town, and a
good college where young men receive their
education.

6. From Middlebury we Will, travel by
stage to Burlington. This town is situated
near the Lake, and is one of the pleasantest
towns in Vermont. The steam-boat that
plies upon the Lake comes here frequently,
and we shall of course take a trip in it to
VVhitehall. VVe shall ﬁnd on board people
from all parts of the country; some of them
have been to Canada, and are now-returning
to their homes at Albany, New York, Phil-
adelphia, and other places.

7. VVe shall sail along upon the Lake at
a rapid ‘rate. On the west side is the shore
of New York, and we can easily see the dis-
tant hills and mountains with the cloud
seeming to rest on their blue tops. ‘F VVe shall
pass a number of pleasant little islands and
shall at length arrive at Whitehall, much de-
lighted with this part of our journey.

8. From Whitehall, which you see by the
map, is in the state of New York, We shall
proceed to Benningtonr in Vermont; the

country over which we shall travel here is‘

hilly and sometimes mountainous. Banning-
ton is a pretty large town, and is famous for a
battle that took place there about ﬁfty years
ago. Several hundred British soldiers came

marching through the country‘ with guns,

swords and cannon, to kill the people of
Vermont. The latter however, were not so

easily killed; they got their swords and guns
and Went forth against the British soldiers
and fought them,and killed a great many of
them, and drove the rest away.

9. After staying a little while at Benning-
ton we will return to Brattleboro across the
mountains; we shall climb some very steep
hills, but the stage will carry us safely. VVe
shall at length reach Brattleboro, and I have
no doubt you will always recollect Vermont
with. pleasure.

10. Though this state has many moun-
tains, yet the people who live among them
are intelligent and happy, and would not ex-
change their wild country for any other.

11. It is very cold in Vermont during the
Winter, and there is more snow there than in
any other part of New England, but the peo-
ple ride about in sleighs, in their thick coats,

and seem not to care for the keen cold wind.
They cover their heads with fur caps and
their ﬁngersgwith fur gloves, and away they
go in their little cutters, over hill and valley.

mountains, and sometimes stealing carefully
along the edge of a precipice.

 

13. In the spring of the year all the snow
is melted, and runs down from the hills and
mountains into the rivers. These then be-
come full, and the waters overﬂow their

often do great damage; sometimes they tear
down mills, carry away bridges, and in some
instances, houses have been overturned and
carried down the stream. These ﬂoods are
called freshets.

4. Sometimes, on parade days, there are
thousands of people upon the common;
many of them come from the country, and
they appear to be very happy. The soldiers
march about, with tall feathers in their caps,
some with swords, some with guns, and
some with cannon. By and by, a long row
of men is formed, called a procession, and
then they march to some church, where they
hear an oration.

  

5. After seeing the common, we should
go"to the top of the State House, from which
‘we can see the whole city of Boston, and
many of the towns around, as Well as the

‘harbor, covered with ships and boats, and
several beautiful islands.

6. We must now visit the Tremont
1 House, which is a beautiful building, and the
lbest hotel in the United States. VVe must
!also Visit the stone market, which is the
handsomest market in the world. After see-
ing all these, and many other interesting
things, we will get into the stage, and travel
to Lowell.

7. On our way we shall observe a canal,
upon which horses are drawing boat loads of
ﬁrewood, cotton, lumber and other articles.
This canal extends from Boston to the river
Merrimack.

8. We shall ﬁnd Lowell to be a very re-
markable place. It has been chieﬂy built
within a few years, but is full of lofty build~
ings, where many thousand yards of cotton
and woollen cloth are made every day. Here
is a picture of one of these buildings.

cester. We shall ﬁnd the country hilly, but
well cultivated. Worcester is a large town,
and one of the handsomest in the country.

which is also a beautiful place. Here we
shall cross Connecticut river, on a ﬁne bridge
covered like a house.

10. Northampton is delightfully situated
close by Connecticut river. After seeing the
town, we must pay a visit to mount Holyoke,
which is three or four miles distant, in a
south-easterly direction. We can ride up the
mountain a part of the way; then we must
tie our horses, get upon our feet, and clamher
to thetop, as Well as we can; we shall ﬁnd
a little building there for our accommodation.

11. A splendid prospect is now before us; to
the west is the valley of the Connecticut, covered
with meadows and ﬁelds of wheat, rye, oats, corn,
barley, broom corn, and beans. The different
colors of these crops, checker the landscape like a
carpet. In the midst of these ﬁelds, ﬂows the
river, turning and winding about, like a great
snake, gliding at full length through the valley.

12. I believe I shall leave you at Northamp-
ton, to make such excursions as you please in the
neighborhood. At the distance of six or seven
miles, is Amherst, where there is a good college;
and at no great distance from Northampton are
Greenﬁeld, VVestﬁeld, and many other handsome
towns.

13. If I had time, I could tell you many more
interesting things of Massachusetts. I could tell
you of the sea, which washes the eastern border
of the state, and nothing is more interesting than
stories of the sea. I could tell you of vessels,
that have been dashed upon the rocks, and bro-
ken to pieces; of the beautiful green islands along
the coast, some of which have very’ swift little ani-
mals upon them called deer. I could tell you of
the porpoises that come dancing upon the waves

over the surface of the bays and inlets.

14. I could tell you also of the Indians who
once lived in Massachusetts, for you must know
that formerly there were no white people here;
there were no towns, then, in the country; it was
all covered with woods, and there were many
bears and wolves and Indians inthem. Aftef
the white people came, the Indians treated them
kindly for awhile, but by and by they became
unfriendly and cruel, and there were bloody wars
between the white people and the savages.

15. On one occasion the white people being
in a house, the Indians surrounded it and tried to
kill those who were within ; they threw large stones
at the windows, and shot bullets and arrows into
the house; then they tried to set it on ﬁre, and
they would have burned it up, if the rain had not
come and put it out.

 

In two or three days, some white people «on
horseback reached the house, drove the Indians
away, and thus saved the lives of those who were
in it.

16. Such, were some of the scenes that occur-_
red, long since, in Massachusetts. The stories of
the wars with the Indians are very interesting,
and you will ﬁnd a full account of them in a work
entitled the “ First Book of History for Children
and Youth.”

STATE OF RHODE ISLAND.

2. The falls at this place, are not only
very beautiful, but they are also very useful.

"The people build their factories close to them,

and direct the water upon large wheels,
which are thus turned swiftly round; these
Wheels set others a going, and thus the whole
interior of a factory is put in motion. It is
in this Way, that the Water of rivers is made
useful, and a single river, will cause as many
yards of cloth to be made in a single day, as
many thousand men could make without it
in a year. .

3. There are a great many cotton facto-
ries at Pawtucket, and it is Well Worth while
for us to go into one of them. , It is really a
Wonderful sight. The cotton is ﬁrst picked,
then carded, and formed into rolls, then spun
into thread, and ﬁnally, these threads are
Woven into cloth, and all this is done by ma-
chinery. There are a good many men, wo-
men and children, in the factories to attend
the machines. If you go into one of these
factories, you will be astonished at the busy

-scene; some of the people are attending to

the carding machines, some to the spinning
jennies, and some to the looms, all is noise,
life, and activity; no person is idle, every one
is engaged in doing something.

4. When the cloth is Woven, it is sent to
market and sold. These cotton cloths are
very useful, and being made by machinery
that is moved by Water, are sold very cheap.
Thus we are provided, with cotton cloths,
which are very necessary for our comfort, at

a low price ; and for this beneﬁt We are great- -

l y indebted to rivers with falls in them, like
the Pawtucket.

5. There is another town in Rhode Island
called Slatersville, where there are also

1. What of Rhode Island? What of Paw-
tucket? 2. What of the falls? What of the
factories? What of a river? 3. What more
can you tell of the factories? -4. What of the

23

several cotton manufactories; but we shall
not have time to visit it. I think we may as
Well go on foot from Pawtucket to Provi-
dence, as it is only ﬁve miles, and the road is
very smooth.

6. VVhen We reach the latter place, we
shall ﬁnd it to be a large and busy town;
one part is situ-ated upon a steep hill, and the
other upon the low ground close tothe Water
To the north we shall observe a large piece
of Water, with a great many canal boats on
it. This is called the basin, and here the
boats stop that are goingup, or have come
down the Blackstone canal. If you choose
to cross this basin, and walk along the border
of the canal, you will see boats loaded with
cotton, drawn by horses in the following
manner.

that one horse, can draw along, ten times
as much, in a canal boat, as he could carry on
a wagon.

8. If We go upon the high part of Provi-T

dence, We shall see a great many splendid
houses there, and we shall also see Brown
University, where many young men receive

cloth? 5. What of Slatersville? 6.

their education. From this bill we have a
ﬁne view of Narraganset bay, which extends
to the south, beyond the reach of sight. We
shall see vessels going upon it, some large and
some small, some returning from a long voy-
age, and others taking leave of home, and set-
ting out for some distant country, far away,
over the ocean.

9. If we go down to the lower part of
the town, we shall see a great many houses
packed close together, and we shall ﬁnd the
streets thronged with busy people. Among
other buildings that attract our attention, We
shall notice one that is particularly handsome,
called the Arcade. It extends from one street
to another, and there is a row of neat little
shops on each side, where all kinds of fancy
articles are sold. You can buy yourself a
new hat, or a new pair of boots, ora penknife,
or anything else you may want. '

10. After staying two or three days at
Providence, we must enter “the steamboat,
and set out for Newport. Here is a picture
of a steamboat just leaving the wharf t at

Providence. ‘ .

STATE OF RHODE ISLAND.

we shall have a view of Bristol, which is a
pleasant town situated on the eastern shore
of the bay.

11. In two hours and a half after leaving
Providence, we shall reach Newport. Here
we shall go ashore, and the steamboat with
the other passengers, will go on her Way to
New York. After getting out of the bay,
the boat enters Long Island Sound; as
she passes around Point Judith, she gener-
ally ﬁnds rough Water, and rolls about a good
deal. The people in the boat, now begin to
feel sea sick, and for a short time, there is a
great uproar on board, but soon the boat gets
into smooth water, the sea sickness passes
away, and everything after this is very pleas-
ant, until the boat reaches New York.

12.. But we stopped at Newport, and
must therefore take a look at the town. It
is ﬁnely situated on a large island called
Rhodes Island, but it is not a very lively place.
VVe shall observe, that the grass is growing
quite across some of the streets. But Ne W-
port is a very interesting town for all this.
The air is delightful, and the inhabitants are
supplied with an abundance of excellent ﬁsh.
Many people go to Newport during the hot
Weather, and greatly prefer it to any other
._place.

13. \Vhile we are at Newport, we must
not fail to go a—ﬁshing; we must get into a
sma‘ boat, taking with us some hooks and
lines, and a plenty of bait; when we have got
out into the Bay, we must come to anchor,
and then put our baited hooks into the water
In a few seconds, we shall feel a jerk, ‘and
up comes a strange looking ﬁsh, with a mouth
as big as a tumbler. \Vhew! it is a sculpin;
next, we shall probably catch a black ﬁsh.
then a cod, and in a short time, we shall have
enough for dinner.

11. Does the steamboat remain at Newport?
What of Long Island Sound? Point Judith? 12

What of Newport? 13. What of fishing?

1. Connecticut is a good deal larger than
Rhode Island, but not so large as Massachu-
setts. It has a great many pleasant towns
and villages, and the inhabitants are so busy,
and industrious as to be, generally, comfort-

able and happy. Some of them are en-

gaged in making buttons, some in making
clocks, some in making tin ware, some in
making hats, and some in manufacturing
cotton and woollen cloths. Some of them
are occupied in tilling the land, and some in
raising cattle and sheep, some of them build
vessels, and others go to sea and catch Whales
and seals; thus, everybody in Connecticut,
is busy about something.

2. Let us suppose that We are in Hart-
ford: here we must visit Washington College;
the Retreat, Where insane people are taken

care of; and cured; and the Asylum, where

children, who are deaf and dumb, are taught
to read and write, and talk by signs. These

poor deaf’ and dumb people, seem to be very

happy, and they will tell you, that it is much
better to be deaf, because those who are so,
avoid hearing many disagreeable sounds. At
Hartford we can get into a nice little steam-
boat, and go to Springﬁeld, a distance of about
twenty-seven miles. This boat goes upon
Connecticut river, which is here a broad
stream. It passes rapidly along, and as we
proceed, We shall notice the pleasant villages
and charming green ﬁelds, situated upon
each side of the river. After staying a few

hours at Springﬁeld, we will return to Hart-

ford the same day, in the boat, much grati-
ﬁed with our expedition.

STATE OF CONNECTICUT.

3. We might now get into another steam-
boat at Hartford, and go down the Connecticut
river, enter Long Island Sound, and proceed
to New York. Should We do this, we should
have a very pleasant trip, and on our way
we should see the fishermen catching shad
along the shore.

We shall notice many pleasant Towns and

‘villages, and We shall admire the high rocks,

and steep hills, that sometimes come close
to the river. '

4. But I think it will be pleasanter to get
into the_stage, and go to New Haven. On
our way we shall pass through Middletown,
which is partly built on a high hill, from
which you can see the valley of Connecticut
river, with the stream ﬂowing through it, all
beautifully displayed to the view.

5. In a short time after leaving Middle-
town, we shall reach New Haven, which is
the handsomest town in the state. In the
centre of the city, is a large open square, cov-
ered with grass. Here you will see many
children playing, and many gentlemen and
ladies walking. This square is surrounded

by handsome buildings, and you will see a

throng of carriages, wagons, carts and stages,

constantly moving around it. On one side,
are the buildings belonging to Yale College,
and in the middle of the square there is a
State House and some handsome churches.

 

6. Before we leave New Haven we must
visit the burying ground. Here the people
are laid when they die; "rows of trees are set
out, which cast their shadows over the place
and give it a sad but pleasing appearance.
Near the burying ground, we shall see the
Farmington Canal, and at the distance of
two miles, we shall observe two lofty cliffs,
called East and West rock.

ed alone, for many years, and the people
called him a hermit. Some years ago, there
was a Woman, in the western part of Con-
necticut, who lived in a cave among the
rocks, both winter and summer. She hadno

bed and no ﬁre, and no one to take care of

her, yet she would hurt no one, and even the
wild foxes, and crows, would often come and
sit by her side; in the other column there is
a picture of this strange woman. 1

8. VVe will now get into the stage and
proceed in a south—westerly direction, towards
the city of New Yor L W'e shall pass through
several very handsome places, particularly
Stratford, Fairﬁeld, Norwalk and Stamford;
all these towns, are near to Long Island
Sound, and the people ﬁequently go in steam-
boats or little vessels, to New York; they
carry with them butter, cheese, and other
articles, which they exchange there, for such
things as they want. The people of Connec-
ticut, make such good butter and cheese,
that the inhabitants of New York are always
glad to get them. i

9. I have told you that the people of Con-

necticut make a great many clocks, hats,

buttons and other things. These articles are
generally sent to New York, and sold there,
but some of the people, take wagon loads of
these things, and travel with them, to a great
distance, and sell them; these people are call-
ed Pedlars, and some of them go to a dis-
tance of ﬁfteen hundred miles. They go
away with their wagons full of buttons,

clocks, or tin ware, and return with their

pockets full of cash.

1. We have now travelled over the six
New England states, and I hope my little
readers have not forgotten the many things
we have seen. I am now going to tell them
something more.

2. The six states called New England,
contain many thousand inhabitants, and sev-
eral hundred towns and villages. It is a
pleasant country to live in, and I believe the
people are as happy as any in the world.
In summer the farmers go into the meadows
and cut down the grass. This is dried by
the sun, and becomes hay. It is then put
on a cart, and stowed safely away in th
barn,* for the cattle in Winter. . '

1n, the hay, oats, flax, rye, and wheat, are
snugly lain up in the barn, the corn is in the
crib, the potatoes and turnips in the cellar,
an l the apples in the garret. The labors
of .he farmer are now chieﬂy over, his stores
are laid in, and he is provided with abundance,
aga.nst the cold long winter that is cominrr.
This is a proper season, for returning thanks

‘to that good Being, who has bestowed all

these gifts; and accordingly the people of
New England, join together in a public fes-
tival called Thanksgivinox “

5. This generally takes place about the
latter part of November. A. few days before
the appointed time, a good quantity of pump-

kin pies are made, turkeys, geese and fowls ,

are killed, and ample provision is made for the

represents three boys, one with a turkey, one
with a jug of molasses, and~another with a
pumpkin.

All these good things are forThanksgiving;

6. Well, all the preparations being made,
and the day come, the bell of the meeting-
house rings, and all the people, in their best
attire, are seen ﬂocking to the place of wor-
ship. The young and the old, grandfathers,
grandmotliers, and grandchildren, some on
foot, some on horseback, and some in wagons,
all with cheerf'ul and happy faces, proceed to
the meeting—house, or church.

Here they join in singing praises to God,

and other fruits of the earth to spring up, and
ripen for food.

7. There is nothing in nature that is beau-
tiful; nothing that is useful; no plant, or tree,
or ﬂower; nothing that we love to eat, noth-
ing that is good for drink, nothing that is
pleasant to look upon; no sound that is sweet
to the ear; nothing that is either used to sus-
tain life, or make us enjoy it, but what God
has given it to us, or endowed us with the
faculties to acquire it. is it not reasonable
then, that we should love God, and serve
him, and do as he wishes we should? ‘I am
sure that all my little readers will answer,
yes!

8. The sermon being ended, the song and
the prayer being over, the people separate
and go to their own houses; there they have
a good dinner, and every body is happy. In
the evening the young people get together,
and amuse themselves in various Ways; some
of them tell stories, some play at blind-man’s-
buff, and some at hide and seek, or hunt the
squirrel. .

out their sleds, ascend to the tops of the hills, and
down they go as swiftly as birds.

10. Some of the older boys, and young men
go to the rivers and ponds, which are new cover-
ed with thick ice. They put on their skates, and
glide over the ice, as if they had wings. They
must be very careful to avoid holes in the ice,
else they will fall in, and be drowned.

1. VVe are now going to take a view of
the state of New York, and it well deserves
our particular attention; it has more people
in it than any other state, it has more wealth
and more interesting objects in it than any
other.

2. Let us imagine that we are at the city
of New York. It has more inhabitants in it,
than any other city in America. It has near-
ly four times as many as Boston or Baltimore,
and almost twice as many as Philadelphia.
It is indeed a prodigious city, and when we
are there, we shall meet in the streets with
hundreds, and thousands of people, some of
them from one country, and some from an
other”; there are people from China, a dis-
tant land far away over the sea, and from
England and France, and South America.

3. All these people come to New York
for commerce; they come in ships loaded
with teas, silks, cloths, calicoes, ginghams,
penknives, razors, and a multitudegof other
tl rags, and they get in exchange, such articles
as our country produces, that they want.

4. Thus you see New York is a great
market, not only do the people go to it from
all parts of our own country, but the mer-
chants come to visit it from every corner of
the globe. While here we must not fail to
go upon the Battery, as it is called, wlﬁch is
a large piece of ground enclosed by fences,
with walks around it; the trees, that are plan-
ted here, and the green grass, that springs up
in summer, make it ‘a very pleasant place:
even in the hottest weather, the sea breeze
which may be enjoyed on the Battery, is very
cool and refreshing; and the ladies and gen-
tlemen may always be seen, in the warm even.

and level foot paths. From the Battery, we
can see the vessels, in the harbour, some
lying still at the wharves, and some with
their white sails spread forth to the wind,
skimming along, over the calm blue wa-
ter. Some of these vessels have come from
a great distance, far over the sea, and bring
many of the productions of other coun»
tries to the merchants of New York. Some
of them bring also the natives and merchants
of those countries, and you will often see
them, in the streets of New York, as I have
before told you. From the Battery we can
also see the steamboats passing and repassing
swiftly, and often full of people going to, or
returning from the busy city.

5. There are several interesting buildings
in New York, but the City Hall is the hand-
somest; it is situated in the midst of a green
lawn called the park. This is embellished
with trees and walks, and we shall see hun-
dreds of ladies and gentlemen, walking there.

 

6. We must stay at least a fortnight in
New York, to get well acquainted with this
great city. We will then get into a steam-
boat and set out for Albany; this place is
about one hundred and ﬁfty miles from New
York, but the boat goes so rapidly, we shall
reach it in twelve hours. The whole trip is

performed on the Hudsdn river, which is a
broad and noble stream.

7. As we pass along, we shall see the
Catskill mountains, which at ﬁrst will appear
like a high dark cloud in the west. By and
by we shall come nearer, and then we shall
observe the rocks, cliffs and precipices, which
form the sides of the mountains. The spec-
tacle is grand in the highest degree; but it
will soon be passed- by the rapid boat, and
the dark tops of the mountains will disappear
behind us. '

8. We shall reach Albany about sun
down. The next day we must examine the
place, which has about 20,000 inhabitants.
We will then set out in the stage, for Utica,
which is a hundred miles from Albany. On
our way, we shall pass through several pleas-
ant towns, and occasionally shall see the great
canal, which leads from Albany to Buffalo.

9. Utica is a large and handsome town,
and is increasing very fast; but we must
soon leave it, and proceed on our journey to
the westward. The stage travels very rapid-
ly here, and we shall be whirled along, over
lakes and rivers, and hills and valleys, through
Auburn, Rochester and many other hand-
some places, until at length we reach Buf-
falo. A

10. This town is situated upon Lake On-
tario, which is a vast sheet of blue water,
seeming as boundless as the ocean. From
Buffalo we must proceed in a carriage to
Niagara Falls. Here the waters of Lake
Erie come tumbling over the rocks, in an
immense torrent, shaking the rocks and hills,
so that the jar may be felt for several miles.

The sound is like continued thunder, and the
mist rises over the spot, and ﬁlls the air like
a cloud; this is indeed a wonderful scene and
no one can look upon it but with feelings of
awe. ’ ,

11. Having spent a few days at the Falls,
we must set out on our return. We may
either go back to Albany in the stage, or by
way of the canal; ‘the boats on the latter
travel at a slow rate, and I suppose you
will prefer going in the stage. Wherever
we go in this state, we shall ﬁnd the lands
well cultivated, and the towns new and hand-
some. At Salina we shall ﬁnd the people
making salt, from salt springs, and at Vernon
fourteen miles from Utica we shall meet with
a town, composed entirely of Indians.

12. Twelve miles ﬁ'om Utica, we shall
ﬁnd Trenton Falls, which are much celebra-

ted for their beauty. The river pours over;

the cliﬂ; and leaps from rock to rock, bubbling
and foaming, till it is white as wool. You
must be careﬁil as you stand upon the dizzy
height, and look down upon this enchanting
water fall, for a young lady from New York,
a few years ago, fell from these rocks down
to the bottom, and was instantly killed.

13. We shall at length arrive at Saratoga.
This is a barren place, surrounded by desolate
hills and plains; yet thousands of people visit
it every year, to drink of its waters; these
come bubbling out of the ground, and are
not only very refreshing, but they are very
beautiful. Having spent a week here, we
will take the stage to Albany, descend the
Hudson river in a steamboat, and ﬁnish’ our
journey by returning to the city of 
York.

sures or NEW JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA, DELAWARE, &c.

1. _ I think I left you at the city of New York,
and if you are not tired of travels, we will now
make a trip through some of the other states.
We have only to cross the North River, to be in
New Jersey; we will then get into the stage, and
ride over a level road to Newark; this is a hand-
some town, famous for building carriages and
coaches.

2. As we proceed on our journey we shall no-
tice many apple orchards, and if it is autumn, we
shall see the ‘people shaking down the apples, and
the boys picking th up. “To shall ﬁnd that

tux’

the apples in New Jersey are very excellent, and
abundant, and that the inhabitants make ﬁne cider.

3. By and by, we shall come to Elizabeth-
town, and afterwards we shall reach Princeton;
at this place there is a good college; ﬁnally, we
shall reach Trenton, which is situated on the river
Delaware. Here we shall take a steamboat, and
go down that river. This part of our journey will
be delightful; the river itself is broad and its banks
are very beautiful. We shall pass several pleas-

ant villages, some on one side, and some on the

other. At length, we shall reach Philadelphia.
4. This city is not so large as New York, ‘but
it is even more pleasing. The streets are all
straight, neat and clean, and many_of«the build-
ings are very handsome.» The United States

35

Bank is, probably, the most beautiful building in
the country.

5. VVe shall see a great many people at Phil-
adelphia, called Quakers; the men wear broad
brimrned hats, and the women wear white or
dove colored bonnets; yet the women are very
pretty, and the men are very honest, and so I
think you will like the Quakers very much.

6. There -is an Arcade at Philadelphia, where
Mr. Peale’s museum is kept. This is a collection
of stuffed birds and beasts, and other strange
things; among the rest, are the bones of a huge
animal, called a Mastodon, that lived many hun-
dred years ago. No such animals are living now.

7. If we were to take the stage at Philad-el-
phia, and travel over the state, we‘ should meet
with many interesting things.

In one par we

should find coal mines, where many thousand‘

loads of coal are dug from the earth, and thence
taken on Rail roads, and canals to Philadelphia.
If we were to go to Lancaster, we should pass
over ﬁne roads and excellent bridges, and see
some of the best farms in the United States.

8. Should we go farther west, we should cross
the Alleghany mountains, which is a. hard day’s
journey, and ﬁnally we should arrive at Pittsburg.
This is a very remarkable town, it is full of man-
ufactories of various Jiinds; and the machinery’.

1. What river do cross, in going from
New York to New. ‘Jersey? VVhat of Newark?
2. What of the apple orchards? VV hat do you
see in the picture? 3. What of Princeton?
What of Trenton? How is it situated? What

of these, instead of being carried by water, is
chieﬂy driven by steam. Coal is very cheap and
abundant at Pittsburg, and this leads the people
to make use of steam in their factories.

9. It would be very pleasant to travel over
Pennsylvania in this way, and see all the interes-
ting things in the state; you would be delighted
to go along the rocky banks of the Juniata, and
roam upon the hills and cliﬂ's that overhang the
Schuylkill. You would be pleased to go to the
villages, and among the farmers, and see how
happy the people are; but all this would require
a long time, so you must be contented with look-
ing about Philadelphia, for the present.

10.‘ One thing we must not forget to see, and
that is the Fairmount VVater Works. These are
‘about three miles from the city, and we can easi-
ly walk there- These works consist of a large
building, in which there are some prodigious great’
wheels, carried around by the water; these wheels
force ome of the Water of the Schuylkill, up to
the top of a high hill, and from thence it ﬂows in
pipes, to the city of Philadelphia. In this way,
the whole city is supplied with water.

11. We must now leave Philadelphia. We
can take the steamboat and proceed down the
Delaware river, or go in the stage. As the latter
method of travelling will enable us to see the coun-
try better, I thiiik we shall prefer it.

12). We shall soon enter the little state of Del-
awaiieig: but it has no large towns, no mountains,
and no large rivers. Yet the people raise excel-
lent wheat, and a good deal of it. In the other col-
umn there is a picture of a man cradling wheat.
Near Wilmington, we shall see some large mills
for making ﬂour, which are the best in the country.
We shall also notice some extensive paper mills.

13. A little below Wilmington, we shall ﬁnd
a canal extending from Delaware Bay, across to

mountains? What of Pittsburg? Are there any
manufactories at Pittsburg? 9. What of the
Juniata? Schuylkill? 10. How far are the
Egairinount Water Works from Philadelphia“? Of
what do these works consist? Of what use are
the “great wheels? 12. What of Delaware?

Chesapeake Bay In one of the boats of this
canal we can take passage to the Chesapeake,
where we shall ﬁnd a large steamboat ready to
take us across the bay, to Baltimore.

14. As we approach this city, we shall be
much pleased with its appearance, and when we
get into the town, we shall like it still better. It
has many ﬁne buildings, among which the cath-
olic cathedral is the most remarkable. But the
most interesting thing at Baltimore, is the rail road,
which is to extend from Maryland to Ohio. Heie
is a picture of one of the cars on this rail road.

15. Baltimore is much the largest town in
Maryland; the people of this state, raise a great
deal of wheat, which is made into ﬂour, and car-

to various parts of the world.

The Sea or Ocean is a vast collection of salt water, upon which vessels sail; an Island
is a piece of land surrounded by water; a City or Town is a place with many houses; a

‘Peninsula is a piece of land nearly surrounded by water; the City in the picture stands on

a Peninsula. A Bay is a part of‘ the sea nearly enclosed by the land; you see little boats
sailing on the Bay in the picture. A River is a stream of water ﬂowing between hills
or mountains; you see a Steamboat going up the River, in the picture. A Road is
a place for cariiages to travel in; a Canal is made by men, and consists of a trench ﬁlled
with water, upon which loaded boats are drawn by horses. A Hill is an elevated piece
of land; you see some cows on the hill in the picture. A Mountain is a very high piece
of land; you see two Mountains in the picture. A Valley. is a low place between hills
or mountains; in the picture the valley is supposed to be between the hill and moun-
tain, and the river to ﬂow through it.

Note. The District of Columbia, you will
see on the map, lies between Maryland and
Virginia. It is ten miles square, and contains

Washington, Georgetown, and Alexandria. At
Washington the President of the United States
lives; and here there is a large building called the
Capitol. In this building Congress meets every
winter, to make laws for the United States. Con

gress consists of men sent from the several states.
They are divided into two bodies, called the Sen-
ate, and House of Representatives. They meet
in different rooms, and transact their business
separately. I shall tell you more of Congress bv
and by.

....¢.....

1. I have now told you about New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland.
These are called the Middle States, because
they lie‘ between New England and the
Southern States.

2. The Middle States are a very fine por-

tion of our country. The winters are not so
severe as in New England, and the people

do not have such good sleighing as in New‘

Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine.

3. In the summer and autumn, they have
abundance of fruit in the Middle States. In
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland,
they have excellent apples, pears, peaches,
and melons.

1. How many of the Middle States are there“?
What are their names? are they calsletl}
the Middle States? 2. what‘ or the Midas
States? Winter in the Middle States? 

38

 In all parts of the United States, there
are a great many birds. It is very pleasant to
go into the woods and orchards, and hear
them sing, and see them build their nests,
and feed their young ones. When you travel
in Pennsylvania and Maryland, you will fre-
quently meet with a bird called the mocking
bird. It is a beautiful singer, and mimics all
the other birds. Here is a picture of a mock-
ing bird.

STATES.

Middle States. One of the most remarkable is
the opossum, which lives in the ﬁelds, and is
about as large as a cat. The mother of the young
opossums has a sort of pouch on the lower part
of her body, which the young ones creep into
when they are frightened. These animals often
climb the trees, and hang from the limbs by their
tails, as in the picture in the other column.

6. I could tell you a great deal about the birds
and four—footed beasts, that you would see in
travelling through the country; but I have only
time to mention the heath-hen, which is like a
partridge, with two curious bags upon its neck.
These birds are often found in.New York and
New Jersey. Here. is a picture of the heath—hen.

 I must now tell you about the history of N ew
York. Nearly 220 years ago, some Dutch people
came across the water from Holland, and began

V to build the city of New York. More Dutch peo -
. ple came over, and settled in various parts of the

colony. But after awhile some English people
came in ships, and took the city of New York.
On the other page is a picture of the Dutch
governor, giving up New York to the English.

8. After this event, the whole colony of N ew
York, belonged to the English. There werefa
great many Indians in the back country, and they
often made war on the white people. About

160 years ago, the Indians made an attack upon
Schenectady, and killed a great many of the in-
habitants. They came into the town at night,
when all the people were asleep, set ﬁre to the
houses, and as the men women and children ran
out, they slew them. Here is a picture of this
dreadful scene.

 

9. All this happened a great while ago; there
are very few Indians in New York now, and
those who are there, are quite peaceful. New
Jersey was once inhabited by Indians, but the
white people settled the country soon after they
settled New York. The first settlement was
made at Elizabethtown. In the next column is a

picture of the whitepeople building houses, and

one of the Indians has come to look on.
10. Pennsylvania was ﬁrst settled by some
quakers sent to the country by William Penn,

who lived in England. After awhile, Penn
came over himself, and made a treaty with the
Indians. He and his people treated them kind-
ly, and the savages made no War upon the inhab-
itants. Here is a picture of VVilliam Penn, and
the Indians. I

11. Delaware and Maryland were also settled
by white people who came from Europe. They
bought the land of the Indians, cut down the for-—
ests, built themselves houses, and ploughed the
lands. They increased rapidly; and after sometime
all the Indians went away.

12. Thus, you see, the ﬁve Middle States,
like New England, were once covered with
woods, and inhabited by savages. They are now
inhabited by white people, who live in good‘
houses, build} ships, manufacture’ cloths‘, hats,
shoes, and other things, raise  upon the
lands, and thus live very eomfortably.’

tobacco, cotton, and rice. The farms are
called plantations, and the owners of them
are called planters. The planters are White
men, and some of them own more than a
hundred slaves.

6. As We pass through the Carolinas, we
shall frequently notice some very handsome

birds, called Carolina pigeons. These often‘

go to New England and the Middle States
in the summer, and are there called Turtle
Doves. They return to the south in the
autumn, Where they spend the Winter. Here
is a picture of two of these birds.

  
   

   

7. To the southwest of South ' arolina,
is Georgia. This is a large state, but there
are not so many people in it, as in South
Carolina. In the northwestern pzgrttcif Geor-
gia, there are a great many Indians called
Creeks, and Cherokees. They do not Wan-
der about in the Woods, like some savages,
but they live in houses, and till the land like
the white people.

10. To the west of Geor ia are three
9

large states, called Alabama, Mississippi, and
Louisiana. In all these states there are a
great many slaves, who are owned by the
white people. They are chiefly engaged in
cultivating cotton, rice, and tobacco.

11. In Louisiana, they make large quan-
tities of sugar and molasses. These are pro-
duced from sugar cane, which is raised very
much in the manner of our Indian corn.

SOUTHERN STATES.

Louisiana, we shall occasionally meet with
marshes ﬁlled with strange animals. In
some of these, there are large snakes, and
hideous creatures called‘ crocodiles. In the
other column, there is a picture of some of
these animals.

13. I must now tell you about the climate
of the Southern States. It is very hot there
in summer; and many of the people leave
the country during that season. In winter
it is never very cold; and in Georgia, Alaba-
ma, Mississippi, and Louisiana, they have
seldom either ice or snow. It is not neces-
sary there, to wear thick woollen clothes, and
have tight houses to keep out the frost, as in
New England.

14. In the Southern States, they have
some fruits which do not grow at the north.
We shall notice ﬁgs, oranges, and lemons
growing upon the trees in Georgia, Alabama,
Mississippi, and Louisiana. These fruits
will not grow at the north, unless they are
taken great care of.

15. We shall see a good many large
towns in the Southern States. If we go to
Charleston, Savannah, or New Orleans, in
the warmest weather, we shall ﬁnd that these
cities appear rather dull; many of the in-

habitants have left their business, and have.

gone into the country, to avoid sickness: but,
if we go in cooler weather, we shall ﬁnd
every one employed; the immense quanti-
ties of cotton, tobacco and other things, that
are shipped from these places to various parts
of the world, cause the people to be very
busy, and you may see the slaves, engaged
in shipping these articles, hard at Work in
every direction. ‘

3. Indiana has no large towns, and there
are not many people in the state. But the
lands are very good, and the people are in-
creasing rapidly. As we travel through the
woods in this state, it is probable we shall
see some large ﬁerce animals called cougars.
Here is a pictureiof a cougar.

 

4. Illinois, like Indiana, has extensive
forests, and but few inhabitants; yet it is a
charming country, and a great many people
go every year from various places to settle
there. Some of the inhabitants raise very
delicious grapes, and when they are ripe, they
make wine of the juice. Many of the people

from the sapof maple trees. Here is a pic-V

shall see immense droves of bisons or bull
faloes. These creatures are wild, and roam
over the plains in search of grass to eat.
They look very much like our horned cattle,
but they have much longer hair. They
make a terrible bellowing, and if‘ you chance
to be near them at night, you cannot sleep
on account of the noise. Here is a picture
of a herd of buffaloes.

WESTERN STATES.

A great many people go to St. Louis, and
from thence ascend the Missouri river in boats,
to a great distance. They then enter the
woods, or go upon the plains in search of
wild animals. They catch a great many
bears, beavers, and other creatures, and hav-
ing collected many skins, return to St. Louis,
and sell them. This is a wild kind of life,
but these hunters like/it very much. ,Here
is a picture of some of them.

 

8. We shall see several steamboats at St.

Louis, which go up and down the Mississippi.
They carry a great many neople down the river
to New Orleans, and bring a great many back.
They also transport vast quantities of grain, beef,
pork, and other things to that city, and bring goods
of all sorts in return. Some of these steamboats
are very large, but I am sorry to say that many of
them have been “torn to pieces, by the bursting
of their boilers. Here is a picture of a steam-

9. Kentucky is a very pleasant state, with a
charming climate. We shall ﬁnd a great friany
pleasant towns here, and shall be delighted with
the beautiful appearance of the country. In the
southwestern part of the state, is an immense
cave, large enough to hold a dozen meeting-
houses. «

10. ‘While we are in Kentucky, the people
Wlll tell us about a very singular man, called Col.
Boone. He was one of the first white men that
came to live in Kentucky. He was very fond of
‘hunting, and used to spend a great part of list
time alone in the woods, with no companion but

it is a pleasant state, with many handsomeatpwns.
VVe shall ﬁnd negro slaves here, as well as in
Kentucky, and Missouri. The other Western
States have no slaves. T

12. I have now given you some little account
of the six Western States. They have not been
settled more than forty or ﬁfty years; but 
country is very fruitful, and the climate is mild.
For these reasons, multitudes of people have
ﬂocked to them, and the population is increasing

. very rapidly. There is no part of omjcountryvso

ﬂourishing as these Westem’;States.

a great deal, and make long speeches, and then
pass the laws, which the people are required to
obey. Here is a picture of the Capitol, and some

3. If you look on the map, you will see that
the land belonging to the United States, stretches
from the Atlantic Ocean on the east, to the Paciﬁc
Ocean on the west; a distance of 2500 miles.
‘But nearly one half of this Vast territory is inhab-
ited by Indians. All the country west of the state
of Missouri, is in the possession of these people.

4. The Indians live in separate tribes, some
of them containing only a few hundreds, and oth-
ers several thousands. Some of them dwell in
tents, which consist of skins stretched upon poles,
as represented in the following picture.

different tribes frequently ﬁght with eachiotha.
Some of the warriors are mounted on horseback,
and carry long spears in their hands. Here is a.
picture of one of these warriors.

 

6. When the Indians are going to war, or are
about to transact important business, the men
meet together, and hold what is called a council.
Here one of the Indians stands up, and makes
a speech, while the rest are sitting on the ground
around him. When he has done, another gets
up, and delivers a speech. When they have all
spoken, then the chief men decide what is to be

done. Here is a picture of an Indian council.

 

7. It is not veryﬁfpleasaril; to travel among
these Indians, for sometimes they attack these
people who go among them. The country, too.
is ﬁlled with wild animals, some of which am
dangerous. Captain Lewis who once travelled

ciﬁc ocean, was chased by a large bear with terri-
ble claws. He ran as fast as he could, but the
creature came jumping after him; and Capt. Lewis
‘only escaped by running into the river.

 

8. There are other animals beside bears in
these distant regions. There are wild deer in
abundance; antelopes that run as swift as a bird
can fly; goats that dwell among the rocks, and
wild sheep that hide themselves in the mountains.
There are also many wild horses, some of which
are very handsome. The Indians often catch them,
and thus supply themselves with these useful ani-
mals. Here is a picture of some wild horses.

UNITED STATES.

Florida, Arkansaw, Northwest, Missouri, and
Oregon. There are not a great many white peo-
ple in any of them; but in a few years it is prob-
able they will all be settled.

10. I will now tell you about the history of
the United States. All this vast country was once
inhabited by the Indians. They had no towns,
and few villages; they had neither commerce, nor
manufactures. They roamed in the forests, and
lived chieﬂy upon ﬁsh, and wild animals. These
animals they killed with bows and arrows.

11. But about 200 years ago, the white peo-
ple came from England and other parts of Europe,
and settled along the eastern coast of the United
States. They built good houses, cut down the
forests, cultivated the land, and sent ships to sea.
Thus thewhite people got possession of the coun-
try, and the Indians gradually retired over the
mountains to the west.

12. The white people had a good many bat-
tles with the Indians before they went away, and
many persons were slain on both sides. Some-
times the Indians came at night, and set the
houses of the white people on ﬁre. Sometimes
they attacked the whites on the sabbath, while
they were going to meetinrr. But these things
happened long since, and the Indians are no longer
troublesome, except in the remote parts of the
western country.

13. It is now about ﬁfty years since the peo-
ple of the United States became a free nation.
Before that time, they were governed by the king
of England. But he was cruel and unjust, so the
inhabitants of America declared‘ that he should
rule over them no longer. The king sent a great
many soldiers here to make the people submit.
But they fought with the soldiers, and after a
bloody truggle, drove them all out of the country.
Thus the people of the United States became a
free nation, and ever since, they have gone on in
happiness and prosperity.

4.2? in Mexico there are some very high moun-
 "hailed the Cordilleras. You will see them
i , , own on the map. They are a part of the
 chain of mountains that cross this portion
of North America, and which in the United States
are called the Rocky Mountains. Some of the
peaks of the Cordilleras are more than three miles
high, and are always covered with snow. Some
of them send forth ﬁre and smoke from their tops,
in a terrible manner; making a great noise, and
shaking the earth far and near. These burning
mountains are called volcanoes.

5. There is a great deal of silver in Mexico,
among the mountains, and many of the people
are engagedin digging it out of the rocks. They
have formed several deep caverns, called mines.
From these they obtain the silver, which is man-
ufactured into dollars. The mines of Mexico
yield several millions of dollars every year.

6. Yea will see on the map, a town named Santa
Fe. This is near the United States, and a good
many people go there from our country to trade
with the Mexicans. A They cross the eastern states
.11 large companies, called caravans. In the other
column is a picture of some of the traders going
V0 Santa Fe.

and that the lands are poorly cultivated. The
people are indeed by no means industrious, and
are more fond of pleasure than of business.

8. Their climate is very delightful, it being
like perpetual spring. They have no winter; no
snow; no frost. The ﬂowers blossom at all sea-
sons; and the trees are ever covered with green
leaves. The country abounds in oranges, ﬁgs,
and other delicious fruits; and the air is so warm,
that the people never need any other than thin
clothing.

9. Many of the inhabitants of Mexico are
Indians. These do not live in the woods, and
hunt wild animals, but till the land, and dwell
in villages. They are the descendants of the In-

dians, who possessed the country about 300 years
ago, when the Spaniards came from Europe, and
conquered them. The white people of Mexico, are
descended from the Spaniards, and they all speak
-the Spanish language. In the other column is a
picture of some of the people of Mexico.

10. I will now tell you about Guatimala. This
is a mountainous country, lying to the south of
Mexico. The Cordilleras pass through it from
north to south, and twenty of their peaks are vol-
canic. Nothing can be more terrible than the

. eruptions of these mountains. They vomit forth

rivers of melted lava ;, they roar like heavythun-
der; and they often ﬁll the air with clouds of
ashes. At night, the blaze issuing from their tops,
seems to rise to the very heavens, and sheds

11. The city of Guatimala is a large and
handsome place. It has been twice destroyed by
earthquakes. In the latter instance, the earth
-opened beneath the city, and it was entirely
swallowed up, with many of the inhabitants.

12. The climate of Guatimala is much like
that of Mexico. The inhabitants are also similar
in the two countries. If you should chance to
visit Guatimala, you will meet with some singular
Indians, with woolly hair. They are called the
Mosquito tribe.

13. On our return from Mexico, we must stop
at the West Indies. These consist of a number
of islands, of which Cuba is the largest. This is
almost as extensive as New England, and is fa-
mous for producing coffee, sugar, and oranges.

14. The principal town is Havana; and here
we shall find a great many vessels from all parts

ago? From whom are the white inhabitants of
Mexico descended? What language do they
speak? 10. What of Guatimala? Cordilleras?

of the United States. They come to Cuba load-
ed with cattle, horses, hogs, lumber, chairs, ta-
bles, and a multitude of other things. These
they exchange for coffee, sugar, and other articles,
which they carry back to the United States.

15. The next of the West India islands in size,
is Hayti. It is inhabited almost entirely, by ne-
groes, who are independent, and govern the coun-
try in their own way. They have several large
towns, and carry on considerable trade with other
parts of the world.

16. Porto Rico and Jamaica, are also large
islands, and beside these, there are many smaller
ones. The climate of them all is very mild, and
seems to be a perpetual summer. They produce

gayest quantities of sugar, rum, molasses, coffee,
7 and some other articles.

Vessels go  these
islands from all parts of the world, to om %

things.
17. I must now tell my little reader about
Columbus. He and his companions were the

ﬁrst men that ever crossed the Atlantic Ocean.
He came with three ships, and discovered America.
They ﬁrst landed on one of the West India islands.
This took place more than 300 years ago.

1. North America is an immense region, con-
taining many mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers,
S Lake Superior is ‘ the
rgest lake in the world, and is more than half
as extensive as V all New England. The river
Mississippi, including the Missouri, is the longest
river in the world; it beingabout 4500 miles long.
The great chain of" mountains in the western part,
including the Cordilleras and Rocky Mountains,
is about 5000 miles long. The whole length of
North America from Melville Island to G uatimala
is 4500 miles.

2. Thus, you see, North America is very ex-
tensive, and is remarkable for its vast lakes, its
long rivers‘-, and its great ranges of mountains. North
America contains eight countries; Guatimala,
Mexico, the United States, the British Possessions,
the Russian Possessions, the country of the Es-
quimaux, Greenland, and Iceland. I have told
you of all of these countries, except the five last;
these I“ am now going to describe.

3. The British Possessions lie chiefly on the
northern side of the St. Lawrence, and the great
lakes. These consist of Upper Canada, of which
Montreal is the capital; Lower Canada, of which
Quebec, is the capital; New Brunswick, of which
F rederickton is the capital; and N ova Scotia,

of which Halifax is the capital. Newfoundland
and Cape Breton also belong to the British.

4. The St. Lawrence is a noble river, and it
would be very pleasant to enter a steamboat at
Montreal, and go down to Quebec. The latter
is a large and remarkable city. The town is di-
vided into two parts; one being low, and close
to the water; the other being built upon high
rocks. A few miles below Quebec, is a very
beautiful ‘waterfall on the river Montmorenci.

5. If you are disposed to go on a ﬁshing voy-
age, we will get into a small vessel at Quebec,
and sail down the St. Lawrence to Newfoundland.
It is a famous place here for catching cod ﬁsh.
These are taken with hooks and lines; they are
then cleaned and salted. When the vessel is full,
they are taken to the shore and dried.

6. I think we shall not like cod ﬁshing very
much, for it is cold, and tedious work. We will
therefore get into the first whale ship we see, and
proceed to the coast of Labrador. I must tell
you, however, that the British Possessions belong
to the king of England, who rules over them.
Among the inhabitants, are a great many English,
Scotch, and Irish.

7. We shall soon reach the coast of Labra-
dor, and here we shall see some strange looking
Indians, called Esquimaux. They are short, fat
people, with long, straight black hair. They

ingly cold, and these people often make them-
selves houses of snow. The windows are made
of thin pieces of ice. In the other column is a
picture of these winter houses.

8. While we are on the coast of Labrador,
we shall meet with a singular little animal, called
a jumping mouse. Its hinder legs are very long,
and it leaps through the air in such a manner,
that you would think it a bird ﬂying. Here is a
picture of one of these curious little animals.

9. Before we go to Greenland, I must tell
you about the Indians, who live between Hudson’s
Bay and the Russian Possessions. These consist
of several scattered tribes, which roam over the
woods and plains, and live chieﬂy by hunting.
They kill a great many bears, wolves, -foxes, and
beavers. The fur of the beaver is very fine, and
the best hats are made of it. It builds itself a snug

PREFACE.

THIS little book is believed to be
essentially different, in several respects,
from any one that has yet appeared.
It is prepared for mere children; and is
intended strictly as a F irst book of Geog-
raphy. Among all those now in use,
many of which are doubtless excellent,
it is believed there are none, the style
and arrangement of which, are well
suited to beginners. A The Author has
attempted to furnish such a book as
appears to be needed; one that may be
used for initiation, and that may prop-
erly be put into the hands of the pupil
before any other. VVhen he has been
through this, he will be prepared for

extensive of
 This book may also be

some more system
used to advantage, as an Introduction
to the “First Book of'li*li~:'i.§Stor)’.”

It will be observed that the Work
contains only American Geography.
It vvas thought that the Geography of
our own Hemisphere, was not only the
most important part of the study, but
that it was the most convenient and
proper, to be used for the purpose of
introducing the pupil to a ﬁrst acquain-
tance with the subject, generally. The
greatest diﬂiculty in teaching Geogra-
phy, is at the beginning. The design
of this book is, toiliemove this diffi-
culty, and the studylgf our own Geog-

 

raphy is used to secure this end. The
pupil once introduced, will easily ﬁnd
books to aid his farther progress. If
we might be permitted to name a work
to follow this, we would recommend the
“ Malte Brun School Geography,” as
being arranged on a similar plan, and
to which, we should regard the present
volume a suitable introduction.

With a view to enliven the subject as
much as possible, the Author has intro-
duced a variety of engravings, and has
embra bed the descriptions in a series of
imaginary travels, which the pupil is
supposed to «perform in company with
the Author.
that this method excites the interest of

Experience has shown

the pupil, perhaps, beyond any other.
The Work contains several neatly
engraved maps, and they are so arrang-
ed, that the questions face the maps to
which they refer. The convenience

of this plan, will be seen at once by

, Teachers.

1. We are now going to take a look at
South America. A You perceive by the map
that it is divided into eight countries. It is
an immense region, and is about 4500 miles
in length, from north to south. We must
proceed very rapidly, or it will take us a great
while to travel over it.

2. We shall ﬁnd Colombia to be a de-

’ lightful country. Along the coast, the lands

are low, and the Weather is always warm like
summer. In the interior, the land is higher,
and there the people enjoy a never changing
spring. Caraccas, Quito, and Santa Fe are
large towns, with many beautiful buildings.
The churches are all ornamented with great
quantities of gold and silver.

3. In Colombia, there are many Indians
who cultivate the land, and live in villages
like those of Mexico. The white people
speak the Spanish language. The Andes are
very lofty mountains, andmany of their peaks
are always covered with snow. Some of
them are volcanoes, and the ﬁre that streams
from their tops may be seen at the dista.r1;,;,,., ,
of many miles. In the next page is a pies
ture of one of these volcanoes.

4. We must now _set out for Peru. ‘ In
our journey we must cross the Andes. The

roads are difficult and dangerous, and the
only, safe way of travelling is upon mules.
These will take us along the edges of preci-
pices, down‘ the steep slopes of the moun-
tains, through dark and dismal valleys, across

swift rivers, and along the brink of roaring“

waterfalls, and ﬁnally, bring us to the end of
our journey in safety. Here is a picture of
people travelling among the Andes.

  
   

very much like _those of Colombia. Lima is
the capital, and it is a very handsome city.
The rich people here are fond of display,
and they live in very splendid houses.

6. We must now proceed to Bolivia.
Here too, the white inhabitants speak the
Spanish ‘language, and the Indians live by
cultivating the soil. Many of the people are

occupied in the gold and silver mines, which
yield large quantities of those precious metals.‘
At Potosi, are some of the most celebrated
silver mines in the world.

7. We will now set out for Chili. This
is one of the ﬁnest countries in South Amer-
ica. The climate is neither hot nor cold.
The land is very fruitful, producing every
species of grain, and all kinds of delicious
fruits. The inhabitants spend a great deal of
their time in the open air, and they may he
often seen dancing with the greatest vivacity
beneath the trees.

8. We shall be delighted with Chili, but
we must leave it now, and set out on our
journey toward Buenos Ayres. This is the
capital of the United Provinces, and lies eaa
of Chili. We must cross the Andes in the
same manner as before. As the roads are
bad, there are no stages and wagons here;
the people are therefore obliged to transport
their goods on the backs of mules or lamas.

9. The lama is a gentle creature, and will
carry a heavy burden for several days, with
the greatest patience. It has long hair, and
somewhat resembles a goat in form; but it
is much larger. Here is a picture of some
people travelling with lamas.

we shall come at length to the plains. These
are of immense extent, and are called pampas.
When we get upon these plains, We shall be
able to see nothing around us but the level
earth, spread out in all directions like a sea.

11. We shall notice vast herds of wild cat-
tle and horses, feeding upon the pampas. The
people of South America supply themselves
with these animals, by catching them with a
rope, called a lasso. This has a noose at the
end, and is thrown by a man on horseback,
with such force and skill, as to secure the an-
imal by the neck or legs, as he pleases. Here
is a picture of a man catching a wild bull
with a lasso. I

be struck with the beautiful situation of the
city, and shall particularly admire some of its
ﬁne streets. Having spent a short time here,
we must proceed in a vessel to Rio J aneiro,
which is the capital of Brazil.

13. Brazil is famous for producing dia-
monds, which are found in the mountains
west of Rio J aneiro. This is also one of the
most fruitful portions of the globe. Every
speages of grain‘ is produced in abundance,
and fruits and ﬂowers decorate the landscape

parrots, and parroquets, may be seen ﬂutter-
ing amid the branches of the trees; birds of
bright plumage are always hovering in the
air; jaguars, and cougars lurk amidst the
thickets; and huge serpents may be seen
gliding along the banks of the rivers. The
armadillo is also found here. It is a singular
animal, armed with a coat of scales, under
which it retires like a tortoise. Here is a pic-
ture of an armadillo.

 

15. To the north of Brazil is Guiana,
which is divided into three colonies; one be-
longing to the English, one to the French,
and one to the Dutch. The white -people
live along the coast, and raise a great deal of
coffee and sugar. The interior is inhabited
by Indians.

16.. At the southern point of South Amer-
ica, is a country called Patagonia. It is an
extensive region, inhabited only by tribes of
Indians. Some of these people are said to be
eight feet high.

17. We have now taken awhasty survey
of South America. It is a very interesting
country, and I must tell you something more,
before we leave it. It is remarkable for ﬁts
lofty mountains, its blazing volcanoes, its
great rivers, and its vast plains.  you will
look on the map, you will see that the Atgdes
extend from the southern point of South
America, to the northern border; the chain"
then passes through Guatimala, Mexico, the

United States, and still farther north to the
Frozen Sea.

18. The number of volcanoes in this
chain, I believe, amounts to more than two
hundred. They commence near Cape Horn,
on the island of 'I‘erra del Fuego. This
name signiﬁes the land of ﬁre; it was so
called on account of the blazing volcanoes
which are often seen by the sailors while
passing around it. In Chili, in Bolivia, in
Peru, in Colombia, in Guatimala and in Mex-
ico, these terrible mountains are constantly
displaying their wonders.  ~

19. Some of them are periodical, and send
forth ﬁre and lava, only at considerable inter-
vals of time ; While others are in constant ac-
tivity. When We contemplate these sublime
works of nature, our thoughts naturally turn
with reverence to the Almighty Being who
made them.

20. The riversof South America are no
less Wonderful than the mountains. The
Amazon has a course of 3000 miles, and it
carries to the sea, as much Water as all the
rivers of Europe. It is so broad at its mouth,
that you cannot see across it, and ships of the
largest burden may ascend the stream, to the
distance of several hundred miles. There
are many other large rivers in South Ameri-

, but I have not time to tell you about
them now. g

21. If I had leisure, 1 could relate a great
 ny. pleasant stories about South America.
‘luld tell you of Capt. Waterton, who Went
into the "interior of Guiana, and there met
 strange adventures. He once caught
an alligator‘ with a hook fastened to a rope,
and While the Indians pulled the monster out
of the river, he jumped upon the creature’s

back, and rode him safely along theishore.
Here is a picture of Capt. Waterton on the
alligator’s back.

 

22. I could tell you of Pizarro, the cruel
Spaniard, who Went to Peru about 300 years
ago, with a band of soldiers, and conquered
the whole empire. I could tell you how he
slaughtered the gentle Peruvians, how he
murdered their king, how he captured their
cities, how he robbed them of their silver and
gold, and how he made them all submit to
his authority. "

23. I could tell you these and many other
interesting things about South America, if I
had time. But you observe that this is alittle
book, and I cannot tell you everything in it.
If you wish to read more about these things,
you will ﬁnd an account of them, in a work
entitled the ‘ Child’s ﬁrst book of History.’

24. We must now take our departure
ﬁ'om Rio Janeiro. We shall be glad to get
back to our own country; for notwithstanding
the ﬁne climate and fertile soil of South Amer-_
ica, a large portion of the inhabimnts are
poor, and miserable. We ﬁshall be gratiﬁed
on reaching our native land, to see how much
happier the "people ‘are here, than in any,
other country We have visited.

GENERAL VIEW OF AMERICA.

CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL VIEW OF AMERICA.

1. I hope my little reader is now pretty
well acquainted with the geography of Amer-
ica. It IS a great continent, and we, who live
upon it, should certainly know all about its
rivers, its lakes, its mountains, islands, towns,
cities, and inhabitants. It is very pleasant to
read about these things, and after you have
learned what is in this book, I hope you will
get some larger one, and study the geogra-
phy of the whole world.

2. I wish you would try to remember the
following things; North and South America
are one great continent, being 9000 miles in
length, from north to south. The whole
number of people in North and South Amer-
ica, is about 40,000,000. North America, is
divided into eight countries, called Guatima-
la, Mexico, United States, British Possessions,

Russian Possessions, country of the Esqui-

maux, Greenland, and Iceland.

3. South America is divided into eight
countries, as follows; Colombia, Peru, Bo-
livia, Chili, Patagonia, United Provinces,
Brazil, and Guiana. Between North and
South America, are the West Indies, which
all belong to different European nations, ex-
cept the island of Hayti, which is indepen-
dent.

4. The northern parts of’ North America
are exceedingly cold. In Greenland, the
Winter continues for nine months in the year,
and no trees, nor plants can ﬂourish there.
Even in Canada, the winters are very severe,
and in New England, we are obliged to take
good care of our noses and ﬁngers, or they
would be ﬁpzen during the months of Jan-
nary and February.

5. In Virginia, the winters are much mild-
er, and in the West Indies, they have never
either snow or frost. Mexico, Guatimala,
and nearly the whole of South America en-
joy a warm climate, where oranges, ﬁgs, and
lemons ﬂourish throughout the year.

6. At Patagonia the climate again be-
comes severe, and some of the islands to the
southeast of Cape Horn, are always covered
with snow, and ice. Thus it appears, that
the northern and southern parts of America

have a severe climate, while the middle port-=
tions are only visited with the gentle gales of”

spring and summer.

7. I will now tell you something about
the history of America. In the year 1492,
Cristopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic
Ocean, from Spain and discovered this con-
He ﬁrst landed at one of the Baha-
mas, called Cat Island. He afterwards went
to Cuba, and Hayti, and then returned to
Spain, and told what he ‘had seen.

8. He soon set out, and came again to
America. In this voyage he discovered sev-
eral other islands.
eries was soon spread all over Europe, and
many adventurers came to visit what was
called the new world.

9. The Spaniards‘ sent over bands of, sol-
diers, who took possession of Mexico, and
a great part of South America. The Dutch,
Portuguese, English, and French, all made
settlements in the country, killed or conquer-
ed the Indians, and thus established ’-the.m,-

selves in various parts of North anddﬁouth"

America.

half’ of the world‘, and over the leaf is a picture
of the other half. The ‘world is round like a
ball, and these pictures represent it as being
surrounded by clouds, with the sun shining
upon one side of it, and the moon and stars
shining upon the other.’

2. The picture of the Western Hemis-
phere shows you the American Continent,
with the Atlantic Ocean on one side, and
the Paciﬁc Ocean on the other. You observe
tllﬂt. vessels are sailing in various directions,
upon these two oceans.

3. If you turn over the leaf, you will no-
tice that the picture of the Eastern Hemis-
phere, exhibits the Eastern Continent, with
the Paciﬁc Ocean on one side, and the Atlantic
Ocean onthe other.

V 4. There are only two continents on the
globe; the eastern and western. These are
separated on one side by the Atlantic Ocean;
on the other by the Paciﬁc.

5. There are ﬁve oceans on the globe;
the Northern Ocean which lies far to the

nortlt; the Southern Ocean, which lies far‘

to the south; the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic
Ocean, and the Paciﬁc Ocean. The Paciﬁc
Ocean is about as extensive as all the
others.

man, and thousands of animals. I-lere towns
and cities are built; here trees grow, and
multitudes of plants and herbs are produced,
ﬁt to become the food of man and beast. The
sea is thronged with ﬁsh; some of which are
of’ prodigious size, and others not larger than
the point of a needle.

7. Thousands of ships are borne upon the
bosom of the sea; and the products of one
climate are thus exchanged for the products of
another. The earth being round, a ship can
stretch forth upon the ocean, and sail entire-
ly around the globe, as a spider would creep
around a pumpkin. "

8. I suppose you have often looked at the
moon when it appeared to be entirely round.
Did it not look like a great ball swung in the
air? VVell, the earth is such a ball, except
that it is much larger. It was placed in the
heavens by God who made it, and it moves
along in obedience to the command of its
Creator.

9. We who live upon it, attend it in all
its motions, and ‘Wherever we may be, are
kept upon its surface, by the principle of at-
traction. If you throw a stone into the air,
it is immediately drawn back to the earth.

10. Thus the inhabitants on all sides of
the world, the mountains, the rivers, and all
the other objects upon it, instead of dropping
from theearth are attached to it, by a force
they cannot resist or overcome.

11. I am afraid this will be a dull chapter
to my little reader; but if‘ he does,not under»
stand what I am saying, he can easily get
some one to explain to him what I have been
endeavoring to make him comprehend.

ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF EUROPE, ASIA, AND AFRICA.

There are a great many different nations in Europe, Asia and Africa. I cannot tell you

much about them in this little book. Some of these people are white, some are black,

and some are brown. Here are pictures of some of the inhabitants of ditferent countries

on the Eastern Continent.
