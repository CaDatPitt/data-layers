Lit-tle flow'rs be-gin their grow-ing Far beneath our feet.
Then she answers, "He is go - ing, Go - ing on his way."
Softly taps the Spring, and cheerily, "Darlings, are you here?"
Poor old Winter does not love you, But his time is past;
Till they answer, "We are near-ly, Near-ly ready, dear."
Soon my birds shall sing above you, Set you free at last.96                 The Burlesque Band.

second time, after which it goes on in two parts. It is believed that not only the
player can continue all the parts, but that the singers can go on perfectly well, where
the words alone are printed. Make such motions as will be appropriate to each
instrument mentioned, and vary the strength of the voice, also, to suit the character
of each. Perhaps the boys may be trusted to beat on the desk with the soft part
of the fist for the Big Base Drum.

niow our little hearts should love him For the tender words he said,
How our lips should tell his goodness, And our voices ring with praise,
How these little feet should serve him, Little hands find labor sweet,

For the babe that came from heaven Just to bless our early days.
When we think what Jesus saved us By his wounded hands and feet.118                  Endeavor Song.

Although all the songs are complete without motions, yet nearly all
of the secular ones admit of more or less action.  "Sweet little Bird,"
p. 4, besides having appropriate motions, can be used as a dialogue, one
singer representing the bird and singing its replies. P. 15: At the words
"H'm, H'm, So, So," place right arm across the body, holding in hand
the elbow of left arm with left hand on left cheek, as if thinking
deeply. P. I7: Let some of the youngest children be chickens and
scatter in all directions as if frightened, finally gather together around
an older child or the teacher, seeking safety.  P. 24: A bird whistle
may be used here wvith pleasing effect. P. 25: Hold up the hands and
move fingers rapidly. P. 26: Let the children march as they sing.
P. 27: "The Violet," let two children or two divisions each sing a
verse apiece. P. 28: At times it would be well to have one or a few
voices on the verse proper, all singing on "Jolly-cum-rattle-te-bang,"
each time it occurs.  P. 34: Imitate the buzz of the bee.  P. 36:
Write the numbers on the board, or count on fingers. P. 38: Hold
out hand, point to lips and eyes, place hand on heart.  At "such
grace," etc., fold hands as in prayer.  P. 40: When sung in exhibitions, the little girl should have a large doll, a curly dog, and "Papa"
for last four lines.  Pp. 4I, 75, I02, Io6: There are quite a nurhber
of songs in this book in which bells can be used effectively. These are
some of them.
At the music-stores may be found whistles, " katy-dids," " cuckoos,"
etc., all of which will be useful.
The above hints, though necessarily brief and limited, are, we believe, sufficient to suggest others, and to give an idea of how we would
mrnake use of these songs in the Kindergarten, School and Home.

Is heard the voice of prayer;

Is never practiced there.

Like night must ever brood;

Fleecy sails of dainty form, Never meant to face a storm;
And what curious things they see,Never seen by you or me;
Each its snow-y pennon casts, Clinging tight to airy masts;
Where they find their elfin crew All the worklc on board to do;
Quick- ly as you gaze they spread, Quickly fly the ships o'erhead.

If your teachers find you true, They will always trust in you.
First to work and soonest done, This is how the prize is won.

She  is  so   la- zy  and so   fat, She is  no  use at all.
And scamper round to hear her purr, She is no use at all.
She  is  by far too fond of ease, She is    no  use at all.

Flew around un-til it set-tied On a downy gosling's back,
Setting nice white things a-flying, All a-bout like flakes of snow.
Clinging there when Mother Goosie Plucked it off with angry clack.
3 Then a fichu trimmed with edging
Rose into the maple-where
Sat a patient robin watching
O'er her pretty eggs with careJust as if it was intended
For a baby bird to wear.
4 Handkerchiefs and bibs and ruffles
In a thorn bush safely fell,
And a dotted muslin floated
In the bucket o'er the well.
But the fate of dolly's night-cap
No one ever yet could tell.
5 0,'twould take sltch skill and patience
All this mischief to repair!
But the little mother hopeful
Worked away with busy care,
Stiched and basted that her darling
Might have something fit to wear.
6 And her brother Charlie fashioned
Clothes-pins of a pattern fine;
So, although the wind might bluster
Flirt and flutter-roar and whine,
It could never, never scatter
Dolly's washing from the line.44               Childhood and the Lilies.

Many of the Songs in this book are accompanied with directions for
action. The words of most of the others suggest the proper motions.
For those who desire them, some hints by the author will be found on
page I58. t'f course the songs can be used with or without motions, at
the will of the teacher.
Those who use this book are invited to consider the following suggestions:
Music is not,noise.  It is not necessary to make children shout and
scream in order to enthuse them. To do that is bad for the songs and
worse for the singers, and you get no music after all. Children will be
interested in any thinlg in which you show an interest. Enthusiasm is
catching  Do not be afraid of high tones. The child voice is of great
compass, and is beautiful and sweet, but do not (I say it again because
it is so important) mistake shouting for singing. Teach exact pronunciation.  Take pains to see that the children understand the meaning
of what they sing.  Do not tire of frequent repetitions in teaching.
Be thorough. Remember that you are doing foundation work; are
making first impressions. Let both be good, for they will be permanent. Have much patience.
The Good Shepherd has taught us that the angels who watch over
little children, are of those who hav,e reached the highest altitudes
of Heaven. What an incentive to loving service for the lambs of the
flock is found in the thought that we are co-workers with-.them "who
do always behold the face of The Father!
