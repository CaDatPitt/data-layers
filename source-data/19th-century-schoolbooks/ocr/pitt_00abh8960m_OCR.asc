sential to man, than to possess the attributei of
speech and reason.
Thotugh no human being can be entirely devoid of this faculty, yet it is possessed in very
different degrees. In some men only faint glimroerings of taste are visible; the beauties
which they relish are of the coarsest kind; and
of these they have only a weak and confused
impression; while in others, taste rises to an
acute discernment, and a lively enjoyment of the
most refised beauties.
Th/s inequality of taste among me,n is to be
ascribed iundoubtedly in part to the different
framne of their natures; to nicer organs, and
more delicate internal powers, with which some
are endued beyond others; yet it is owing still
more to culture an4 education. Taste is certainly one of the most improvable faculties of
our tature. We may easily be convinced of
the truth of this assertion by only reflecting on
tliat immense superiority which education and
improvement give to civilized, above barbarous
nations, in refinorment of taste; and on the advantage whrich they give, in the same nation,
to those who hiave studied the liberal arts,
above the rude and illiterate vulgar.
Reason and good sense have so extensive an
influence on ail the operations antd decisions of
taste, that a comptetely good taste may well be
considered as a power compounded of natural
seisibility to beauty, and of improved understanding.'o be satisfied of this, we may observe, that the greater part qf the productions

ORIGIN     AND    NATURE      OF FIGURATIVE   LANGUAGE.
FiGURES may be described to be that lan.
guage, which is prompted either by the imagination or passions.  They are commonly divided by rhetoricians into two great classes, figures of words, and figures of thought. The
former are commonly called tropes, and consist
in a word's being used to signify something different from its original meaning.  Hence, if the
word be changed, the figure is destroyed.
Thus, for instances, "light ariseth to the upright in darkness."' Here the trope consists in
" light and darkness" not being taken literally,
but substituted for comfort in adversity; to
which conditions of life thev are supposed to
bear some resemblance.  lthe other class, termed figures of thought, supposes the figure to
consist in the sentiment only, while the words
are used in their literal sense; as in exclama.
tions, interrogations, apostrophes, and comnparisons; where, though the words be varied, or
$8F1GTIRATIVE LANGUAGE.         -99
translated from one language into another, the
same figure is still preserved. This distinction however, is of small importance; as practice cannot be assisted by it; nor is it always
very perspicuous.
Tropes are derived in part from the barrenness of language; but principally from the influence, which the imagination has over all language. The imagination never contemplates
any one idea or object as single and alone; but
as accompanied by others, which mav be considered as its accessories. These accessories
often operate more forcibly upon the mind, than
the principal idea itself. They are, perhaps,
in their nature more agreeable, or more familjar to our conceptions; or remind us of a greater variety of important circumstances.  Hence
the name of the accessory or correspondent
idea is substituted; although the principal has
a proper and well known name of its own.
Thus, for example, whaen we design to point
out the period, in which a state enjoyed most
reputation or glory, we might easily employ
the proper words for expressing this; but, as
this, itn our imagination, is readily connected
with the flourishing period of a plant or tree,
we prefer this correspondent idea and say,
" The Roman empire flourished most under
Augustus."  The leader of a faction is a plain
expression; but, because the head is the principal part of the human body, and is supposed
to direct all the animal operations, resting orb
this:esemblance, we say, " Cataline was the
bead of his party."
We shall now examine, why tropes and figE100         RTGIN A.ND tATVR!E OF,ares contribute to the beauty and grace ot
style.  By them  language is enriched, and
made more copious.  Hence words and phrasesare multiplied for expressing all sorts of
ideas; for describing even the smallest differences; the nicest shades and colors ofthought;
which by proper words alone cannot possibly
be expressed. They also give dignity to style,
which is degraded by the familiarity of common words. Figures laave the same effect on
language, that a rich and splendid apparel has
on a person of rank and dignity.   In prose
compositions, assistance of this kind is often requisite; to poetry it is essential. To say," 1 the
sun rises," is common and trite; but it becomes
a magniicent image, as expreeoed by Thomson:
But yonder comes the powerful king of day;
Rejoicitng in the east,
Figures furnish the pleasure of enjoying two
objects, presented at the saime time to our views
without confusion; the principal idea, together
with its accessory, which gives it the figurative
appearance. When, for example, instead of
"'youth," we say " the morning of life;" the
fancy is instantly entertained withl- all the corresponding circutnstances betwveen these two
objects. At the same instant we behold a certain period of human life, and a certain time of
the day so connected, that the imagination
plays between them with delight, and views at
once two similar objects without embarrrassment.
Figures are also attended with the additional
-advantage of givingaus a more clear and ti:iFIG URATIVE LAN'GUAGE.
king view of the principal object, than if it
were expressed in simple terms, and freed
from its accessory idea. They exhibit the object, on which they are employed, in a picturesque form; they render an abstract concep
tion in some degree an object of sense; they
surround it'With circumstances, which enable
the mind to lay hold of it steadily, and to contemplate it fully. By a well adapted figure,
even conviction is assisted, and a truth is -impressed upon the mind with additional liveliness and torce. Thus in the following passage
of Dr. Young; "When we dip too deep in
pleasure, we always stir a sediment, that renders it impure and noxious."  Wlhen an image
presents such a resemblance betweena morail
and a sensible idea, it serves, like an argument
from analogy,.to enforce what the authlor advances, and to induce belief.
All tropes being foutded on the relation
which one object bears to another, the name o
the one may be substituted for that of the other; and by this tle.vivacity of the idlea is generally ineareased.  The relation between a
cause and its effect, is one of the first and
most obvious.  Hence the cause is son,eti;a:es
figuratively put for the effecc.  Thus Mir. Ad.
dison, wvriting of italy, says.
Ilossomi.:and fruits, andl flowers togelitbr rise,
And ttle whole year in gay cllifisiol, lies.
Her-e the "' whole year" is plainly meant to.
signify the productions of the year. The effect is als.o often put for the cause;.as " grey
hairs;" for "l old age," which produces grey
hairs; and "'shade,"' for the "' trees," which
12
10LRI02  rN, &amp;Co.
cause the shade. The relation between the
container and the thing contained is so intimate
and apparent, as naturally to give rise to tropes.
Ille impiger hausit
-Spumautern patexam, et pleno se poluit aure:
Where it is obvious, that the cup and geld
are put for the liquor, coatained in the golden
cup. The name of a country is often nsed to
signify its inhabitants. To pray for the assis.
tence of Heaven is the same with praying for
the assistance of God, who is tin heaven. The
relation between a sign and the thing signified
is another so&lt;urce of trepes. Thus,
Cedant arma togas, concedat laurea linguse:
Here the " togr," which isthe badge of the
civil professions, and the "1 laurel,"' that of military honors, are each of them put for the civil
and military characters themselves. Tropes,
founded on these several relations of cause and
effect, container and contained, sign and tbing
signified' are called by the name of metonomny.
When a trope is founded on the relation between an antecedent and its consequent, it is
called a metalepsis; as in the'Roman phrase,
"fuit," or "vixit," to signify that one was
dead. " Fuit Ilium et ingens gloriaTeucrurm,"'
expresses that the glory of Troy is no more.
When the whole is put.for a part, or a part
for the whole; a genus for a species, or a species for a genus; the singular number for the
plural, or the plural for the singular; in general, when any thiing less, or any thing more, is
put for the precise object meant; the figure is
then termed a synecdoche. We say, for in-.stance ".A feet of so many sail," instead-of soq-VESTIO1NS.               103

the"~ waves" for the "1sea."    An attribute i-s

times, a subject for its attribuite. Buit the ~rela-'

On what are tropes called metalepsis, founded?2.
W#,hen-is a gure called syaeidochd?1METAPHOR,
METAPHOR.
METAPHOR is founded entirely on the resemblance which one object bears to another.
It is therefore nearly allied to simile or comparison; and is, indeed, a comparison in an abridged form. When we say of a great minister," He upholds the state, like a pillar, which
supports the weight of an edifice," we evidently make a oomparison; but, when we say of
him, he is the " pillar of the state," it becomes
a metaphor.
Of all the figures of speeeh, none approaches so near to painting as metaphor. It gives
light and strength to description; makes intellectual ideas in some degree visible, by giving themcolor, substance and sensible qualities. To produce. this effect, however, a
delicate hand is requisite; for by a little inaccuracy we may introduce confusion, instead of
promoting perspicuity. Several rules, there.
fore, must be given for the proper management
of metaphors.
The first rule respecting metaphors is, they
must be suited to the nature of the subject;
neither too numerous, nor too gay, nor too elevated for it; we must neither attempt to force
the subject by the use of them into a degree
of elevation not congruous to it; nor on the
contrary, suffer it to fall below its proper dignity. Some metaphors are beautiful in poetry,
which would be unnatural in prose; some are
graceful in orations, which would be highly improper in historical or philosophical composition.  Figures are the dress of sentiment104They should consequently be adapted to the
ideas which they are intended to adorn.
The second rule respects the choice of objects Whence metaphors are to be drawn. The
field for fgurative language is very wide.  All
nature opens her stores, and allows us to collect them without restraint. But we must beware -of using such allusions. as raise in the
mind disagreeable, mean, low, or dirty ideas.
To render a metaphor perfect, it must pot only
be apt, but pleasing; it must entertain'as well
as enlighten. Dryden, therefore, can hardly
escape the imputation of a very-unpardonable
breach of delicacy, when he observes to the
Earl of Dorset, that "some bad poems carry
their owner's marks about them; some brand
or other on this -buttock, or that ear.; that it is
notorious who are the owners of the cattle."
The most pleasing metaphors are derived fr*m
the frequent eccurrences of art and nature,
or from the civil traisactions and customs
of mankind.  Thus, how expressive, yet at the
same time how famniliar, is the image which
Otway has prtinto the mouth of Metellus, in
his play of Caius Marius, where he calls Sulpicius
That mad wild.bslll,'whom'Mariu s:lets loose
On each occasion, when he'd make Rome {teelhim,
To toss our laws and liberties in the air.
In the third place, a metaphor should be
founded on a resemblance which is clear' and
striking, not far fetched, nor difficult to bd discovered.  Harsh or irced metaphors are always displeasing, because they perplex the reader, and, instead of illustrating the thoughtb;ender it iutricate and,:confused. Thus for inSITETIi AP3EOR
1f5stance, Cowley, speaking of his mistress, ex.
presses himself in the following forced and obscure verses:
W'o to her stubborn heart; if once mine come
Into the self same room,'Twill tear and blow up all within.
Like a grenada shot into a magazineThen shall Love keep the ashes and torn parts
Of both our broken hearts;
Shall out of both one new one make;
From her's the alloy,from mine the metal take;
ovr of her heart he frons the flames will find
But little left belhind;
MWine only will remain entire;
No dross was there to perish in the fire.
Metaphors borrowed from     any of the scjences, especially from  particular professions, are
almost always faulty by their obscurity.
In the fourth place, we must never jumble
metaphorical and plain language together;
never construct a period so, that part of it must
be under,,tood metaphorically, part literally;'which always produces confusion.    The works
of Ossiaa afford an instance of the fault we are
now censuring.   "Trothal went forth with the
stream  of his people; but they met a rock;
for Fingal stood unmoved; brokea, they rolled
back from his side.  Nor did they roll in safety; the spear of the king pursued their flight.'"
The metaphor at the beginning is beautiful;
the "~ stream," the "' unmoved rock,' the waves
"C rolling back broken," are expressions in the
proper and consistentlanguage of figure.     But
in the end, when we are told, I&amp; they did not roll
in safety, because the spear of the king pursuedtheir flight," the literal meaning is injudiciously mixed with the metaphor; they are at
the same moment presented to as as waves thai
106
-METAPHOR.)TETAP1~OR.
rou, and as men that mnay be pursued and zwoun-,ded by a spear.
In the fifth place, take care not to make two
different metaphors meet on the same object.
This,~ which is called mnixed metaphor, is one of
thie g'rossest abuses of this figure.     Shakspeare's expression, for example, "4to take arms
against a sea of troubles, " makes a most unna't
u-ral medley, andi entirely confounds the im;rgi.
nation.  More correct wvriters than Shakspeare
are sometimes guilty- of this error. Mr. Addiso -
says,"6 There is not a single view of human nature whiceh is Dot sufficient to extinguish the
seeds of pride." -Here a viewv is madle to extinguish, ar~d to extinguish seeds.
In examining the propriety of metaphors, it
is a good rule to form, a picturte of them, and
to consider he'w the p'arts agree, and what kind
of'figure the whole presents, whien delineated
with a pencil.
Met-aphors, in the sixth place, should not be:,crowded together on the same object. "Thouigh
earsh of them be distinct, ypt, if they be he-ap.
ed on one another, thiey produce ctnfusion.
The fol-lvwing passage from Horace will exemp)lify this observation:
MSotum ex Metello consule ecisicim,
Bcliquie causas,et N'itia, et meodos.

PAsibcipm fLwicitias, et armia

This passage, thouigh very poetical, is.~ rendered hnarsh and obscure by thiree distinket metaphors, crowded together. First, "1arma sine/a.cruoribus nootdumn expicttis;", next "1Opus plenwurrTAST,I
or manners of mea. Now the pleasure we ex.
periernce from sucht imrnitations or representations
is fotunded on mere taste; but to jud.ge whether
they be properly executed, belongs to the understanding, which compares the copy with the
original.
In reading, for instance, the Xneid of Virgil,
a great part of our pieasure arises from the
proper conduct of the plan or story; from all
the parts being joined together with probability
and due connection; Iromn the adoption of the
characters from nature, the correspondence of
the sentiments to the characters, and of the
style to the sentiments. The pleasure w hich
is derived from a poem so conducted, is felt or
enjoyed by taste, as an interntal sense; but the
discovery of this conduct in the poem is owing
to reason; and the more reason enables us to
discover such propriety in the'conduct, the
greater will be our pleasure.''he constituents of taste, whlen brought to
its most perfect state, are two, PLrcacv and
fORRECTNESS.
Delicacy of taste refers principally to the
perfection of that natural sensibility, on which
taste is foulnded. It implies those finer organs
or powers, which enable us to discover beauties, that are concealed from a vulgar eye. It
is jutdged of by the s'ame marks, that we employ in judging of the delicacy of an external
sense. As thie goodness of the palate is riot
tried by strong flayors, but by at mixture of ingredients, where, notwithstanding the confusion,
We remain sensible of each; so delicacy of in,
ternal taste appears, by a quick and lively searIU~~~S ~MaTAPnUOR.
pericsdosse aleom;   and then, itincedts per, inp.rsuppositos eineri dls.
T-he last rule conce,rning metaphors is, they  
should not be\ too, far pursuied.,For, when thel
resemblane, whbich is4hbe foundcation of the fig.
uire is long.dwelt upon-, and carrie'd inito all its
tainute cire-uwsta'nces, an allegory'is produeed,
instead of- a- metaphor;- th-e re'ader is wearied,
and the discourse becomes obscure. This is,
term.    straining-'' ametaphor.     Dr.   Young,
w-hose imagination was- m-ore distinguis-held by
strent-h, than delicacy-: is often guilty of runnina down    his metaphors.      Speaking of: old
age, he says, it should

T-he two first lines are uincommonly bea-utical; but whien he continues- the me~taphor by
putting good, worksA on bo ard, and, wvaiting the
wind," it is strained, and sinks in dignity.
Having. treated of' me'taphor, we shall con6lude this-,chapter-w-ith a4few words c'oncerning
Allegory.
An Alle'gory- is a continued metaphor- as it
is the representation of one thing by anothier
that resem-bles it. Thus, Pr'ior makes Emma
describe her constancy to Henryin the lollowing. allegorical manner:
i ti but purpose to emhbvk iths thee,

of the affinity between them. The only material difference beside the one being short and
the other prolonged is, that a metaphor always
explains itself by the words that are connected
with it in their proper and literal meaning; as
when we say, " Achilles was a lion;  "An able
minister is the pillar of the state."  Lion and
pillar are here sufficiently interpreted by the
mention of Achilles and the minister, which
are joined to them. But an allegory may be
allowed to stand less connected with the literal
meaning; the interpretation not being so plain.

HYPERBOLE.
HYPERBOLE consists in magnifying an obh.
ject beyond its natur:al bound1s. This figure ocr
curs very frequently in all languages, even in
common conversation; "as swpift as the wind,"
"a.s white as snow;" and our usual'form;s of
1'nQ~PO         R1~HYP13CB LE;
compliment are in general extravagant hyper.
boles.  From habit, however, these exaggerated expre.ssions are seldom considered as hyperbolical.
Hyperbolesi are of two kiinds'; such      as are
employed in description, or such as, are suggesgested by passion. Those are fart best which
are the effect of passion; since it not only gives
rise'to the most daring figures, but often     renders them Just and natutal.     Hence the following'passage in Milton, though extremely hyperbolical, contains nothing but what is natural and'
proper.   It exhiibits the mind of Satan agitate4'
by rage and despair.
Me miserable! which way shall I fly
Infifnite wrath and infinite despair?
Which-, way I flg is hell; myself am hell;
ADd in the lowest depth. a lower deep,
Still threat'ning to devour me, opens wide,'1To which the hell t snffter seems a heaven.
In simple description   hyperboles must be enma
ployed with more cautiion.     When    an- earthqpake or storm is described, or when our imagination is carried into the midst of a'battle, we
can bear strong hyperboles without displeasure.
But when only a woman in grief is' presented,
to our view, it is impossible not to be disgusted
with such exaggeration as the folowing, in oneof our dramatic poets:.~----I found ber on the flbor
In all' the storm of grief, yet beautiful;
Pouring forth tears at such a lavish rate,
That, were the world on fire, they might hate dirownl:
The wrath of Heav'6, and quench'd them sighty rain.
This is mere bombast.    The person herself
who labored under the distracting agitations of
grief, might-be permitted to express herself in
saong hyperbale; but the spectttor who dew1' ERiso NFI CATG I 0.    1,
seribes her, cannot be allowed equal liberty.
The jyst boundary of this figure cannot be ascertained by any precise rule. Good sense and
an aecurate taste must ascertain the limit, beyond whici, if it pass, it becomes.extravagant.

PERSONIFPIC;ATIO N      AND    A.POSTROPHIE,
WE proceed now to those figures which lie
altogether in the thought, the.words being taken in-their common and literal sense. We
shall begin with Personification, by which life
and action are attributed to inanimate objects.
All poetry,even in its most humble form,abounds
in this figure. From prose it is far from -being
excluded; nay, even in common conversation
frequent approaches are made to it. When we
say, the earth thirsts:for-rain, or the fields smile
with plenty; when ambition is said to be restless, or a disease to be deceitful; such expressions show thei~acility with which the mind can
accommodate tbhe properties of living creatures
to things inanimate, or abstract conceptions.
There are three different degrees of this -fiI 15             ~aPERSOmrxFATIOm.
ure, which it is requisite to distinguish in order
to deter.nine the propriety of its use. The
first is when some ot the properties of living
creatures are ascribed to inanimate objects}
the second, when those inanimate objects are
described as acting like such as have life; and
the third, when they are exhibited either as
speaking to us, or as listening to what we say
to them,
The first and lowest degree of this figure,
which consists in ascribing to inanimate objects
some of the qualities of living creatures, raises
the style so little, that the humblest discourse
admits it without any force. Thus " a raging
sterm, a deceitful disease, a cruel disaster," are
familiar expressions. This, indeed, is so obscure a degree of personification, that it might,
perhaps, be properly classed with simple metaphors, which almost escape our observation.
The second degree of this figure is, when we
represent inanimate objects acting like those
that have life. Here we rise a step higher,
and the personification becomes sensible. According to the nature of the action which we
ascribe to those inanimate objects, and to the
particularity with which we describe it, is the
strength of the figure.  When pursued to a
considerable length, it belongs only to studied'barangues; when slightly touched, it may be
admitted into less elevated compositions. Cice.
ro, for example, speaking of the cases where
killing a man is lawful in self:defence, uses the
following expressions: 4 "Jliquando nobis gladius ad occidendum hominem ab ipsis porrigitur legibus."  Here the laws are beautifully personFZRSOTFICCATY.                 1-3i
ified, as reaching forth their hand. to give us a
sword for putting a man to death.
In poetry personifications of this kind are erx
tremnely frequent, and ere indeed the        life antd
soul of it. In the descriptions of a poet who
has a lively'fancy, every    thing is animated.
Homer, the father of poetry, is remarkable for
the use of this figure.'War, peace, darts, rivers, every thing, in short, is alive in his writings.  The same is true   of Milton and    Shakspeare. No personification is more striking, or
introduced on a more proper occasion, than the
following of Milton upon Eve9s eating the forbidden fruit:
So saying, her rash hand in evil hour
Forth reaching to the fruit, she pluck'd, she ate!
Earth felt the wound; and nattiure, from her seat,
Sighing through all her works, gave signs of wo,'That all was lest.
The third and highest degree of -this figure
is yet to be mentioned; when inanimate,objects
are represented, not only as feeling and -acting,
but asspeaking to us, or listening while we        ad.
dress them. This is the boldest oqf all rhetorical figures; it is the style of strong passion only. and therefore    should never be      attempted,
except when the mind is considerably heated
and agitated.    Milton affords a very      beautiful
example of this figure, in that moving and tea.

This is the real language of nature and of
female passion.
In the management of this sort of personification two rules are   to be observed;     First,
never attempt it unless prompted by strong.
pa?sion, and never continue it when the passion begins to -subside.   The second rule is,
never personify an object which has not some
dignity in itself, and which is incapable of making a proper figure in the elevation to which
we raise it. To address the body of a deceased
friend is natural; but to address the clothes
which he wore, introduces low and degrading
ideas.   So, likewise, addressiag   the  several
parts of the body, as if they were animated, is
not agreeable to the dignity of passion. For
this reason the following    passage in Pope's
Eloisa to Abelard is liable to censure:
Dear, fatal name! rest ever unreveal'd,
Nor pass these lips, in holy silence seaI'd.
Hide it my heart, witliin that close disguise,
Where mix'd with God's his lov'd idea lies!
0 write it not, my hand!-his name appears
Already written-blot it out, my tears.
Here the name of Abelard is first personified;
wrhich, as the name of a Person often stands for
the person himself, is exposed to no objection.
Wext, Eloisa personifies her own heart; and,
as the heart is a dignified part of the human
frame, and is often put for the mind, this also
may pass without censure.    But when she addresses her hand, and tells it not to write his
name, this is forced   and unnatural.   Yet the
figurebecomes still worse when she, exhortsher tears to blot out what her hand had written.
The two last lines are indeed altogether unsui.
table to the tenderness which breathes through
the rest of that inimitable poem.
ArPOsTROPH is an address to a real person,
but one who is either absent or dead, as if he
were present and listening to us. This figure
is in boldness a degree lower than personification; since it requires less effort of imagination
to sappose persons present who are dead or absent, than to animate insensible beings, and direct our discoturse to them.   The poems of
Ossian abound in beautiful instanced of this figure.-" Weep on the rocks of rcaring winds,
O maid of Inistore. Bend tUky fair head over
the waves, thou fairer than the ghost of the
hills, when it moves in a sunbeam at noon over
the silence of Morven.    He is hallen! Thr

-GATION, EXCLAMATION) AND OTHER FIGURBS OF SPEECH.
A COMPARISON or simile is, when the resemblance between.two ebjects is expressed in
form, and usually pursued more fully than the
nature of a metaphor admits.  As when we
say,.T'he actions of princes are like those
great rivers, the course of which every one
beholds, but their springs have been seen by
few."  This short instance: will show that a.
happy comparison is a sort of sparkling ornament, which adds lustre and beauty to discourse.
All comparisons may be reduced under two
heads, explaining and embellishing comparisons.
For when a writer coampares an object with
any other thing, it always is,.or ought to be,
witf a view to make us understand that object,more clearly, or ta render it more pleasing.
Even abstract reasoning admits explaining comparisons. For instance, the distinction between
the powers of sense and imagination is in Mr.
Harris's Hermes illustrated by a simile: " As
wax," says he, c" would not'be adequate to the
purpose of signature,.if it.had not the power
to retain as well as to receive the impression,
the same holds of the soul with respect to 3ense
and imagination. Sense is its receptive power,
and imagination its retentive.  Had it sense
without imagination, it would not be as wax, but
as water; where, though all impressions Be
instantly made, yet, as soon as they are made,
they are /lost." ln comparisens of this kind,perspicuity and usefulness are chiefly to be
-studied.
But embellishing comparisons are those
which most frequently occur. Resemblance, it
has been observed, is the foundation of this figure. Yet: resemblance must not be taken in too
strict a sense for actual similitude. Two objects may raise a train of concordant ideas in
thet mind, though they resemble each other,
strictly speaking, in nothing.  For example,
to describe the nature of soft and melancholy
music,-Ossian says," The music of Carryl was,
like the memory of joys that are past, pleasant
and mournful to the soul." This is happy and
delicate; yet so kind of music bears any resemblance to the memory of past joys.
We shall now consider when comparisons may
be introduced with propriety, Since they are
the-language of imagination rather than of passion, an author can hardly commit a gre,ater
fault; than in the midst of passion to introduce a
sirmile. Our writers of tragedies often err in
this respect. Thus, Addison in his Cato makes
Portius, just after Lucia had bid him farewell
forever, express himselfin a studied comparison.
Thus o'er the dying lamp. th, unsteady flanro
Hangs quivI'ring on a point, leaps off by fits,
And falls again, as loth to quias lold.
Thou must not go; my soul stilihovers o'er thee,
And can,t get looset
As comparison is not the style of strong passion, so, when designed for embellishment, it is
not the language of a mind totally unmoved.
Being a figure of dignity, it always requires
some elevation in the subject, to make it proper. It supposes the imagination to be enliven117
COMPARISON.sibility to its finest, most compounded, or most
latent objects.
Correctness of taste respects the improvement this faculty receives through its connection with the understanding. A man of correct
taste is one who is never imposed upon by counterfeit beauties; wvbo carries always, in his owu
mind, that standard of good sense, which he
employs in judging of every thing. He estimates with propriety the relative merit of the
several beauties which he mneets in any work of
genitus; refers them to their proper classes;
asigns the principles, as far as they can be traced, whence their power of pleasing is derived;
and is pleased himself precisely in that degree.
in which he ouobght, and no more.
Taste is certainly not an arbitrary principle,
which is subject to the fancy of every individual,
and wvhich admits no criterion for determining
whether it be true or false.  Its foundation
is the same in every. human mind. It is built
upon sentiments and perceptions1 which are inseparable from our nature; and which generally
operate with the same uniformity as our other
intellectual principles.  When these sentiments
are perverted by ignorance or prejudice, they
may be rectifiel by reason. Their sound and
natutral state is finally determined by comparing
them with the general taste of mankind. Let
men d.eclaim as much as they please concerning
the caprice and uncertainty of taste; it is found,
by experien&amp;e, that there are beauties, which,
if displayed in a proper light, have power to
comm.aandlasting and universal admiration. In
every composition, what interests the imagini
10
TASTE.'is8'SOMPAIUISON.,ed, though the heart is not agitated bhy passion.
The language df simile lies in the middle region,'between the highly pathetic and the very humble style. It is however, a sparkling ornament,
and must consequently dazzle and fatigue, if it
recur too often. Similes, even in poetry, should
be employed with moderation; but in prose
much more so; otherwise the style will become
disgustingly luscious, and the ornament lose its
beauty and effect.
We shall now consider the nature of:those
objects *from which  comparisons should be
drawn.
Inthe first place, they must not be drawn'from things which have too near and ob vious a
resemblance ofthe object with which they are
compared. The'pleasure we receive from the
act of comparing, arises from the discovery of
likenesses among things of different species,
where we should not at first sight expect a resemblance.
But, in the second place, as comparisons
ought not to be founded on likenesses too obvious, much less ought they to be {founded on
those which are too'faint and distant. These,
instead of assisting, strain the'fancy to comprehend them, and throoino.light upon the sub.
ject.
In the third place, the object from which a
comparison is drawn ought never to be an unknown object, nor one of which few people can
have a clear idea. Therefore similes, faunded
on philosophical discoveries or on any thing
with which persons of a rarticular trade only,
or a particular profession, are acquainted,.pIoiANTITiEZSa.,           1t,1
duce not their proper effect; They should bedrawn from those illustrious and noted objects,
which most readers have either seen, or can
strongly conceive.
In the fourth place, in compositions ef a seriousor elevated kind, similes should never be.
drawn from low or mean objects. These degrade and vilify; whereas similes are generally
intended to, embellish- and! dignify. ThereforeT
except in burlesque writings, or where an object is smeant to be degraded, mean ideas should
never be presented.
ANTITHESIS is founded on the contrast or opposition of two objec's.  By contrast, objects
opposed to each other appear in a stronger
light. Beauty, for instance, never appears so
charming as when contrasted  with  ugl-iness.
Antithesis, therefore, may on many eccasions
be used advantageously to strengthen the impression which we propose that any object
sheuld make.   Thus Cicero, in his oration
for Milo, representing the improbability of Milo's designing to take- away the life of Clodius,
when every thing was unfavorable. to such design, after he had omitted many opportunities of
effecting such a purpose, heightens our conviction of this improbability by a skiilful use of this
figure.-" Quem igitur curn omnium gratia interficere noluit, hwne volutet cum aliquorumn querela?
Quemnjure, quem  l oco, quem temrpore, quem impune, non est ausus; hAne injuria, iniquo loco, alieno tempore, periculo, eapitis, non dubitavit occi.
dere.?-' Here the antithesis is rendered complete, by the words and members of the senatence, expressing the contrasted objects, beingINliTERRQGATO'*S.
similarly constructed, and made to correspond
with each other.
We must, however, acknowledge that frequent use of antithesis, especially where the
opposition in the words is nice and quaint, is
apt to make style unpleasing.  A maxim  or
moral saying very properly receives this form;
because it is supposed to be the effect of meditation, and is designed to be engraven on the
memory, which recals it more easily by the aid
of contrasted expressions. But where several
such sentences succeed each other, where this
is an author's favorite and prevailing mode of
expression, his style is exposed to censure.
INTERROCAT1ONS and EXCLAMAT1oNS are passionate figures. The literal use of interrogation is to ask a question; but w3en men are
prompted by passion, whatever they would affirmor deny with great earnestness, they naturally put in the form of a question; expressing thereby the firmest confidence of the
truth of their own opinion, and appealing to
their hearers for the impossibility of the contrarv.,Thus, in Scripture, " God is not a man that
he should lie, nor the son of man that he should
repent. Hath he said it? and shall he not do
it'? Hath he spoken it? and shall he not make
it good?"
Interrogations may be employed in the prosecutiou of close and earnest reasonings; but
exclamations belong only to stronger emotions
of the mind; to surprise, anger, joy, grief, and
the like. These being natural signs of a moved and agitated mind, always, when properly
employed, make us sympathize. with those
120wko use them, and enter into their feelings.
Nothing, however, has a worse effect than frequent and unseasonable use of exclamations.
Young, inexperienced writers suppose that, by
pouring them  forth plenteously, they render
their compositions warm and animated. But
the contrary follows; they render them frigid
to excess. When an author is always calling
upon us to enter into transports, which he has
said nothing to inspire, he excites our disgust
and indignation.
Anotber figure of speech, fit only for animated composition, is called VISION; when, in.
stead of relating something that is past, we use
the present tense, and describe it as if passing
before our eyes.  Thus Cicero, in his fourth
oration against Cataline:  " Videor enim mihi
hanc urbemn videre, lucem orbis terrarum atque arcem omniurm gentium, subito uno incendio conci.
dentem; cerno animo sepulta in pattia miseros
atque insepultos acervos civium; versatur mihi
ante oculos aspectus Cethegi, et furor, in vestra
coede bacchantis."' This figure has great force
when it is well executed, and when it flows
from genuine enthusiasm. Otherwise, itshares
the same fate vith all feeble attempts toward
passionate figures; that of tlhrowing ridicule
upon the author, and leaving the reader more
cool and uninterested than he was before.
The last figure which we shall mention, and
which is of frequent use amnong all publlfc speakers, is CLIMAX. It consists in an artful exaggeration ofall the circumstances of some object

light. It operates by a gradual rise of one cir.

of this figure from a printed pleading of a celebrated lawyer in a charge to the jury, in the
case ot h woman who was accused of murdering her own child.   Gentlemen, if one man
had any how slain another, if an adversary had
killed his opposer, or a woman occasioned the

regular ctimaxes, however, though they have
great beau ty, yet at the same time have the appearance of art ani study; and therefore,
though they may be admitted into formal harangues, yet they are not the language of pas.

GENERAL     CHARACTERS OF STYLE.          DIFFUSE, CONCISE, FEEBLE, NERVOUS, DRY,
PLAIN, NEAT, ELEGANT, FLOWERY.
THAT different subjects ought to be treated
in different kinds of style, is a positi-on so obvi.
ous that it requires no illustration.  Every one
knows th-at treatises of philosophy should not
be cemposed in the same style with orations.
It is equally apparent,.that different parts of the
same composition require a    variation in the
style.  Yet amid this variety, we still expect to
find in the compositions of any one man some
degree of uniformity in manner; we expect to
find some prevailing character of style imprese

liar genius and turn of mind. The orations it
Livv differ considerably in style, as they ought
to do, from the rest of his history. The same
may be observed in those of Tacitus. Yet in
the orations of both these historians, the distinguished manner of each may be clearly traced; the splendid fulness of the one, and the
sententious brevitv of' the other. Wherever
there is real genius, it prompts to one kind of
style rather than to another.  Where this is
wanting; where there is no marked nor peculiar character in the compositious of an author;
we are apt to conclude, and not without cause,
that he is a vulgar and trivial author, who
writes from imitation, and not from the impulse
of genius.
One of the first and most obvious distinctions
in style arises from  an author's expanding his
thoughts more orless. This distinction forms
what are termed the diffuse4and concise styles.
A concise writer compresses his ideas into the
fewest words; he employs none but the most
expressive; he lops off all those which ate not
a materialaddition to the sense. Whatever ornament he admits, is adopted for the sake of
forte, rather than of grace. The same thought
is never repeated.  The utmost precision is
studied in his sentences; and they are general.,
ly designedto suggest more to the reader's imagination than theylexpr.ess.
A diffuse writer unfolds his idea fully. He
places it in a variety of lights, and gives the

Each of these styles has its peculiar advantages; and each becomes faulty, when carried
to the extreme  OQf conciseness, carried as far
as propriety will allow, perhaps in some cases

hess, Cicero is undoubtedly the noblest instance
Which can be given.   Addison, also, and Sir
William Temple, may be ranked in the same
class.
In determining when to adopt the concise, and,when the diffuse manner, we must be guided by
the nature of tte composition. Discourses that
are to be spoken, require a more diffuse style
than books-which are to be read. In written
compositions, a proper degree of conciseness
has great advantages. JIt is more lively, keeps
up attention, makes a stronger impression on
the mind, and gratifies the reader, by supplying
more exercise to his thoughts.  Description,
when we wish to have it vivid and animated,
should be concise. Any redundant words or
circumstances encumber the fancy, and render
the object we present to it confused andindistinct.
The strength and vivacity of description, whether in prose or poetry, depend much more upon
a happy choice of one or two important circunistances, than upon the multiplication of them.
When we desire to strike the fancv, or to move

the-heart,we should he concise; when to inform
the understanding, which' is more deliberate in
its motions, and wants the assistance of a guide,
it is better to be full.  Historical narration may
be beautiful either in a concise or diffuse manner, according to the author's genius. Livy and
Herodotss are diffuse; Thucydides and Sallust
are concise; yet they are all agreeable.
The nervous and the feeble arp generall y
considered as characters of style of the same
import with the coticise and the diffuse. Indeed
they frequently coincide; yet this does not always hold; since there are instances of writers,
who in the midst of a full and ample style, have.
maintained a considerable, degree of strength.
Livy is an instance Qf the truth of this observation. The foundation of a nervous or weak
style is laid in an author's manner of thinking.
If he conceive an object strongly, he will express it with energy; but if he have an indistinct view of his subject, it will clearly appear
in his style. Unmeaning words and loose epithets will escape him; his expressions will be
vague and general; his arrangewments indistinct;
and our conception of his meaning will be faint
and conftused.  But a nervous writer, be his
style concise or extended, gives: us always a,
strong idea of his meaning.  His mind being
filll of his subject, his words -:re alwvays expressive; every lphrase anid every figure renders
the picture which le would set before us, mnore
striking and complete.
It must however, be observed, that too great
study of strength is apt to betray writers into a
harsh manner. Harshness proceeds from unF'PExLE A3tD -DRY.
common words, from forced inversions in the
construction of a sentence, and from neglect of
smoothness and ease. This is reckoned the
fault of some of our earliest classics; such as Sir
Walter Raleigh, Sir Francis Bacon, Hooker,
Harrington, Cudworth, and other writers of
considerable reputation in the days of Queen
Elizabeth, James 4. and Charles I. These writers had nerve and strengh in a high degree.;
and are toYthis day distinguished by this quality
in style. But the language in their hands was
very different from what it is now, and was indeed entirely formed upon'the idiom and construction of the Latin in the arrangement of
sentences. The presentform of our language
has in some degree sacrificed the study'of
strength;to that of ease and perspicuity. Our
arrangement is less forcible, but more plain and
natural; and this is now considered as the genius of our tongue.
Hitherto style has been considered under
those characters which regard its expressive.
ness of an author's meaning.  We shall now
consider it with respect to the degree of ornament employed to embellish it. Here the style
of differentauthors seems to rise in the follow.
ing gradation; a dry, a plain, a neat, an elegant,,a flowery manner.
A dry manner excludes every kind of ornament. Content with being understood, it aims
not to please either the fancy or the ear. This
is tolerable only in a pure didactic writing; and
even there, to make.us bear it, great solidity of
matter and entire perspicuity of language are
required.

all ages and nations. There is a certain string,
which being properly struck, the human heart
is so made as to accord to it.
Hence the universal testimony, which the
most improved nations of the earth1 throughl a
long series of ages, have concurred to bestow
on some few works of genius; such as, the Iliad
of Homer) and the AEaeid of Virgil.    Hence
the authority which such works have obtained,
as standards of poetical composition; since by
them we are enabled to collect what the sense
of mankind is, with respect to those beauties,
which give them the highest pleasure, atnd
which, therefore, poetry ought to exhibit. Au,

An elegant style implies a higher degree of
ornament than a neat one; possessing all the
virtues of ornatnent, without any of its excesses
or defects. Complete elegance iniplies great
perspicuity and propriety; purity in the choice
of words,; and care' and skill in their; arrangeIment, It implies,,fdrther, ti3e beauties of imagination.sprcad over style as far as the subject
permits; and all the illustration which figurative language adds, when properly employed.
An elegatit writer, in short, is one who delights
the fancy and the ear,while he informs the understanding; who clothes his ideas in all the beauty of expression, but does not overload then
with any of its misplaced finery.
A florid style implies excess of ornament.
In a young composer it is not only pardonable,
but often a promising symptom. But although
it may be allowedto youth in their first essays,
it must not receive the same indu'gence ftom
writeirs of more experience.:In them, judgment should chasten imagination, an!d reject
every ornament which is unsuitable or redundant. That tinsel splendor of language which
some writers peepetually affect, is truly con-:temptible.  With such, it is a luxuriancy of
words, not of fancy. They forget that, unless
founded on good sense and solid thought, the
nmost florid style.is but a childish. imposition oa

STYLE. SIMPLE,        A:FFECTLED,      V~EIE.MIEN?.     DIRECTIONS        FOR   FORM11ING A PROPER STYLE.
SIMPLICIT5Y, applied to writing, is a term
very commonly used; buf, lilie many other
critical terms, often used without precision.
The different meanings of the word simplicity
are the chief cause of this inaccuracy. It isSIMPLICITY.
therefore necessary to show, in what sense simplicity is a proper, attribute of style. There
are four different acceptations, in which this
term is taken.
The first is simplicity of composition, as op.
posed to too great a variety of parts. This is
the simplicity of plan in tragedy, as distinguished from double plots and crowded incidents;
the simplicity of the Iliad in opposition to the
digressions of Lucan; the simplicity of Grecian
architecture in opposition to the irregular variety of the Gothic. Simplicity in this sense
is the same with unity.
The second sense is simplicity of'thought in
opposition  to refinement.  Simple thoughts
are those which flow naturally; which are suggested by the subject or occasion; and which,
when once suggested, are easily understood by
all. Refinement in writing means a less obvious and natural train of thought, which, when
carried too far, approaches to intricacy, and
displeases us by the appearance of being far
sought. Thus Parnell is a poet of much greater simplicity in his turn of thought than Cow
ley. In these twQ senses simplicity has no relation to style.
The third sense of simplicity regards style,
and is opposed to teo much ornament, or pomp
of language.  Thas we say Mr. Locke is a
simple, Mr. Hervey a florid writer. A simple
style, in this sense, coincides with a plain or
aeat style.
The fourth sense of simplicitly also respects
style; but it regards not so much the degree of
ornament eniployed, as the easy and natural1                q srMPLICITr.
manner, in which our language expresses our
thoughts. In this sense simplicity is compatiblewith the highest ornament.  Homer, for
example, possesses this simplicity in the great-.
est perfection; and yet no writer has more or.
nament and beauty. This simplicity is opposed
not to ornament, but to affectation *f ornament;
and is a superior ex-cellence in composition.
A simple writer has no marks of art in hisegpression;. it appears the very language of'
nature. We see not the writer and hirlabour,
but the man in his own natural character. He
may be rich in expression; he may be full of
figures and of fancy; but these flow from  him
without effbrt; and he seems to write in this
manner, not because he had studied it, but
because it is the mode of expression most nat
ural to him. With this character of style a
certain degree of negligence is not inconSistent;
for too accurate an attention to words is foreign to it. -Simplicity of style, like simplicity
of manners, shows a man's sentiments land turn
of mind without disguise. A more studied and
artificial mode of writing, however beautiful,
has always this disadvantage, that it exhibits am
author in form, like a man at court,.where splendor of dress nr.d the ceremonial of belaviour
copeeal those peculiarities, which distinguish
one man from another. But reading an author
of simplicity is like conversing with a person
of rank at home and with ease, where we see
his natural manners and his real cbaracter.
With regard to simplicity in genetal, we may
observe, that the ancient origina:l writers are
always- most eminent for, it.  This procceds"AxCT?ATi:~T
~rm a very obvious cause; they wrote from
the dictates of genius, and were not formed upon the labounrs and writings of others.
Of affectation, which is opposed to simplicity
ef style;, we have a remarkab-le example in
Lord Shaftesbtry. Though an author of cork.
siderable merit, he expresses rbothing with simplicity. He seems to have thought it V;lgar
and beneath the dignity of a man of quality, to
speak like other- men. Hence he, is ever in
buskins; full of circumlocutions and artificial
elegance. In every sentente we see marks of
labour and art; nothing qf- that-ease which expresses an-sentiment' coming.s natural and warm
from the heart. He abounds with figures and
ornament'of; every kind; is- sometimes? happy
in them; but his fondness for- them is too visilble; and, having once seized some metaphor or
ailusion, that pleased him, he knows not how to
part with it.  H e possessed delicacy and refinement of. taste in a degree that may be called excessive and sickly; but he had little
warmth of passion; a-nd the coldness of hischaracter suggested that artificial and stately
manner, which ap.pears in his writings. No a-.
thor is more dangerous to the tribe of imitatorsthan- Shaftesbury; whe amid several very con.
siderable blemishes, hlas- many dazzling and implosing- beauties,
It is very possible, however, for an a,t,or to
write with simplicity, and yet without beauty.
He may be free from affectation, and not:have
merit. Beautiful simplicity supposes an author
to- possess real genius, and to write- with- solidity,
Mpurity, and brilliancy of imagination. In this
case, the simplicity of his manner is the crowning ornament; it heightens every other beauty;
it is the dress of nature, without which all beauties are imperfect.  But, if mere absence of
affectation were sufficient to constitute beauty
of style, weak and dull writers might often lay
claim to it. A distinction therefore must be
made betweeK that,simplicity which accompanies true genius and is entirely compatible with
every 1roper ornament of style; and that
which is the effect of carelessness.
Another character of style, different from
those already mentioned, is vehemence. This
always implies strength; and is not in any res.
pect incompatible with simplicity. It is distin.
guished by a peculiar ardor; it is the language
of a man, whose imagination and passions are
glowing and impetuous; who, neglecting inferior graces, pours himself forth with the rapidity and fulness of a torrent. This belongs
to the higher kinds of oratory; and is rather
expected from a man who is speaking, than
from one who is writing in his closet. Demos.
thenes is the most full and perfept example of
this kiud of style.
Having, explained the different characters of
style, we shall conclude our observations with
a few directions for attaining a good style in
genera?.
The, first direction is, study clear ideas of the
subject, on which you are to write or speak.
What we conceive clearly and feel strongly, we
naturally express with clearness and strength.
We should therefore thiak closely on the sub134
STYLt.DIRECTIONS FOR FORMING A PROPER STYLE. 15
ject, till we have attained a full and disict
view of the matter which we are to clotbe in
words; till we become warm and interested in
it; then, and then only shall we find expression begin to flow.
Secondly, to the acquisition of a good style,
frequency of composing is indispensably necessary. But it is not every kind of composing
that will improve style.  By a careless and
hasty habit of writiag, a bad style will be acquired; more trouble will afterwards be necessary to unlearn faults, than to become acquain.
ted with the rudiments of composition. In the
beginning, therefore, we ought to write slowly
and with much care. Facility and speed are
the fruit of practice. We must be cautious,
however, not to retard the course of thought,
nor cool the ardor of imagination, by pausing
too long on every word. On certain occasions
a glow of composition must be kept up, if we
hope to express ourselves happily, though at
the expense of some inaccuracies. A more
severe examination must be the work of correction. What we have written should be laid
by some time, till the ardor of composition be
past; till partiality for our expressions be
weakened, and the expressions themselves be
forgotten; and then, reviewing our work with
a cool and critical eye as if it were the performance of another, we shall discover many imperfections which at first escaped us.
Thirdly, acquaintance with the style of the
best authors is peculiarly requisite. Hence a
just taste will be formed, and a copious fund of
words supplied on every subject. No exercise136     DIRECTIOoNS FOR FORMrGa, &amp;g.
perhaps will be found more useful for acquiro
ing a proper style, than translating some passage from'an eminent author into our own
words; Thus to take, for instance, a page of
one of Addison's Spectators, and read it attentively two or three Atimes, till we are in full
possession of the thoughts it contains; then to
lay aside the book; to endeavor to write out
the passage from memory as well as we can;
and then to compare what we have written with
the style of the author. Such an exercise will
shew us our defects; will teach us to correct
them; and from the variety of expression which
it will exhibit, will conduct us to that which is
most beautiful.
Fourthly, caution must be used against servile
imitation of any author whatever.  Desirel of
imitating hampers genius, and generally produ"es stiffness of expression.  They, who follow
an author closely,- commonly copy his faults.as
well as his beauties.  No one will ever become a good writer or speaker, who has not
some confidence in his own genius. We ought
carefully to avoid using any author's;peculiar
phrases, and of transcribing passages from:him.
Such a habit will be fatal to all genuine composition. It is much better to have~something of
our own, though of moderate -beauty, than to
shine in borrowed ornaments, which will at last
betray the poverty of our genius.
Fifthly, always adapt your style to the subject, and likewise to the, capacity of your hearers, if you are to speak in public. To attempt
a poetical-style, when it should be our business
ealy to reason, is.in the highest degree awkward and absurd.   To spea'k with elaborate
pomp of words befqre those who cannot comrn
prehend them, is equally ridiculous.  When we
are to write or speak, we should previously fix
in our minds a clear idea of the end aimed at;
keep this steadily in view, and adapt our style
to it.
Lastly, let not attention to style engross us so
much, as to prevent a higher degree of atten.
tion to the thoughts.  This rule'is more neces.
sary, since the present taste of ihe age is dlire'ted more to style than to thouglht. It is much
more easy to dress up trifling and commorn
thoughts with some beauty of expression, than
to afford a fund of vigorous, ingenious, andl useful sentiments.- The latter requires genius;
the farmer may be attained by industry. Hetce
the crowd of writers who are rich in style, but
poorin sentiment. Custom obliges us to be attentive to the ornaments of style, if we wish
our labours to be read and admired. But he is
a contemptible writer, who looks not beyond
the dress of language; who lays not the chief
stress upon his matter, and employs not such
ornaments of style to recommend it,as are manly, not foppish.

CRITICAL    EXAMINA'TION     OF MIR. ADDISON'S STYIE IN NO. 411 OF THE        SPECTATOR.
HAVING fully insisted on the subject of language, we shall now commeace a critical anal3F rinf.:ADDlsOW^S 55E.E
ysis of the style of some good author.  This
will suggest;observations, which we hrve not
hitherto had occasion to make, and wll show
in a practical light the use, of those which have
been made.
Mr. Addison, though one of the most beautiful writers in our language, is not the moest cor.
rect; a circumstance which-makes his coup,osition a proper subject of criticism. We  proceed therefore to examine No. 41 1, the - irst of
his celebrated essays on the plea'sures of the
imagination,in the sixth volume of, the Spectator. It begins tbus:
Our,sight is, the most perfectya:and most delight.
ful of all our senses.
This sentence isaclear, precise, -and simple.
t'he author in a few plain words lays down the
proposition, which he is going to illustrate. A
first sentence should seldom be long, aand never
intricate.
He:might, have said, our sight is the.most perfect and the most delightful.  But in omitting to
repeat the particle the, he has been more judicious; for, as betweenerfect arid delightful
there is no contrast, such a repetition is unn'ecessary.  He proceeds:.
Itfills the mind with the largest 7ariety of ides,
converses with its objects at the greatest diseasce,
and contin7ues the lcngest in action, wvithout b6tig
tired or satiated with its proper enjoymen-ts.
This sentence.is,remarkably harmonious, and
wvell constructed.  It is entirely perspicuous.
It isloaded with no unnecessary words, TIhat

its unity, is here perfectly presrved. Tkt140          CeRITICAL ExAlIN4TION
members of it also grow, and rise above each
other in sound, till it is conducted to one of the
most harmonious closes which our language admits   It is moreover figurative without being
too much so for the subject. There is nb fault
in it whiatever, except this,' the epithet large,
which he. applies to variety, is more commonly
applied to extent than to number.  It is plain
Lowever, that he employed it to ayoid the word
great, which occurs immediately afterward.
The sense of eeling can, indeed, give us a notion
of extension, shape,: and all other ideas that enter
at the eye, except colors; but; at the same time, it
is very much straitened- and confined in its operations,to the number, bulk,and distance of its particuiar objects. But is not every sense confined,3
much as the sense of feeling, to the number,
bulk, and distance of its own objects? The turn
of expression is also very inaccurate, requiring
the two words wzith regard, to be inserted after
the word operations, in order to make the sense
clear and intelligible.  The epithet particular
seems to be used instead of peculiar; but these
words, though often confounded, are of very
different import. Particular is opposed to general; peculiar stands opposed to what is possessed in comn7on with others.
Our sight seemns designed to supply all these defects, and may be considered as a more delicate,nd diffusive kind of touch, thtat spreads itself over
an-infinite multitude of bodies, comprehends the
largest figures, and brings into our reach some of
the most remote parts of the universe.
This sentence is perspicuous, gracefil, well
arranged, and highly musical. Its constructionOF Uni ArmxSoN'9d'YL            1,41

ing and compounding those im-ages zwhich wc have
once received, into all the varieties of picture and
vision. But we cannot with propriety say,retaining thetn into all the varieties; yet the arrangement requires this construction. This error
might h'ave been avoided by arranging the passage in the following manner: "'We have the
power of' retaining those images which we have
once received; and of altering and compounding^them into all the varieties of picture and
vision." The latter part of the sentence is
clear and elegant.
There are few words in the English language,
which are employed in a'more loose and uncircumscribed sense than those of the fancy and the i'magination.
Except when some assertion of consequence
is advanced, these little words it is and there are,
ought to be avoided; as redundant and enfeebling. The two first words of this sentence
therefore should have been omitted. The article prefixed tofancy and imagination ought also
to have been omitted,since he does not mean the
powers of thefancy and the imagination, but the
words only: The sentence should have run
thus: "Few words in the English language are
employed in a more loose and' uncircumscribed
sense than fancy an-d imagination."
I therefore thought it necessary te fix and determine the notion of these two words, as I intend to
mnake use of them in the thread of my following
speculations, that the reader may' conceive rightly
what is the subject which Iproceed upon.
The words fix and determine, though they
may appear so, are not synonymous. We fix,or MR. ADDISON'S STYLE.
what is loose; we determine, what is uncircumscribed. They may be viewed, therefore, as
applied here with peculiar delicacy.  The notion of these words is rather harsh, and is not so
commonly used, as the meaning of these words..1s I intend to make use of them in the thread of
my-specalations, is evidently faulty.  A sort of
metapbor is improperly mixed, with words in
their literal sense.  The subject eahich I proceed
upon, is an ungriceful close of a sentence; it
should have been, the subject upon which I proceed.
I must therefire duesire him to remember, that,
by the pleasures of imagination, I mean only such
pleasures.as arise originally from sight, and that
I divide these pleasures into two kinds.
This sentence begins in a manner too similar
to the preceding.  I mean only such pleasuresthe adverb only is not in its proper place.  It is
not intended here to qualify the verb mean, but
such pleasures; and ought therefore to be pla.
ced immediately after the latter.
My design being, first of all, to discourse of
thoseprimary pleasures of thef imagination, iwhich
entirzly proceed from such objects as are:.before
our eyes; and, in the nextp lace, to speak of those
secondary pleasures of the imagination, which flou
from the ideas of visible objects, w,henr the objects
are not actually before the eye, but are called up
into our memories, or fe.r,ned into agreeable vis.
ions of things, that are either absent or fictittous.
Neatness and brevity, are peculiarly requisite in the division of a subject. This sentence
is somewhat clogged by a tedious phraseology.

The phrase,: more preferable, is:so palpable

thissentence, is neither clearly' nor elegantly
expressed.  It mu6st be confessed, that those of the'

This is a good illustration of what he had
been asserting, and is expressed with that ele.
gance, by which Mr. Addison is distinguished.
Besides, the pleasttres of the imagina ion have
this advantage above those of the understanding,
that they are more obvtous, and more easy to be
acquired.
This sentence is unexceptionable.
It ii but opening the eye, and the scene enters.
Though this is lively and picturesque, yet
we must remark a saia!l inaccuracy. A scene
cannot be said to enter; ans actor enters; but a
scene appears or presents itself.
The colors paint themselves on the.fancy, with
&lt;very little attention of thought or application of
mnind in the beholder.
This is beautiful and elegant, and well suited
to those pleasures of the imagination of which
the author is treating.
We are struck, we know not how, with the symmetry of any thing we see; and immediately assent to the beauty of an object zvithout inquiring
into the particular causes and occasions of it.
We assent to tile truth of a proposition  but
cannot with propriety be said to assent to the
beauty of an object. In the conclusion, particular, and occasions are superfluous words, and the

The term polite is oftener applied to mannerls, than to the imagination. The use of that

and is undoubtedly so in the present instance.
He can converse with a picture, and find an

pleasures that are not criminal;  every diversiorn

another, and their very first step out, of businessw
is into vice orfolly.

correct.

Of this nature are those of the imagination,
which do not require such a bent of thought as is,necessary to our more serious employments: nor,

indolence and remissness, which are apt to accompany our more sensual delights; but, like a gentle
exercise to the faculties, awaken them from  sloth
and idleness uithout putting them UTon any labor

The beginning of this sentence is incorrect.
Of this nature, says he, are those of the imnainao
tion.  It might be asked, of what nature?  For
the preceding sentence had not described the
nature of any class of pleasures. He had said
th!at it was every man's duty    to make the
sphere of his innocent pleasures as extensive as
possible, that within- this sphere he might find a
safe retreat and laudable satisfaction.  The
transition therefore is loosely made.  It would
have been better, if he had said, " this advantage we gain," or " this satisfaction we enjoy,"'by means of the pleasures of the imagination.
The rest of the sentence is correct.

-ELOQUENGE. ORIGIN        OF'ELOQUENCGE
GRECIAN ELOQUENCE. DEMOSTIHENES.
ELOQUENCE is the art of persuasion. Its
most essential requisites are solid argument,
clear method, and an appearance of sincerity in
the speaker, with such graces of style and utterance as to command attention.   Good sense
must be its foundation.  Without this, no.man
can be truly eloquent e since fools can p)ersiiade
-none but fools.  Before we can persuade a
-man of -sense, we must convince him. iConvincincg and, persuading, though sometimes confounrled, are of very different import. Conviction affects the understanding only; persua.
sion the will and the pr-actice. lt-is' the business
of a philosopher to convince us of truth; it is
I hat of an orator to persuade us to act conformalyv to it by engaging our affections in its favor.
Conviction is, however, one avenue to the
heart; and it is that which an orator must first
atttempt to gain; for no persuasion canhbe stable
which is not foundted on conviction.'But the
orator must not be satisfied with corrvi1ciag; he
must addre,ss himself to the passions; he must

paint to the fancy, and touch the heart. hnent
beside solid argument and clear method, all the
conciliating and interesting arts of composition
and pronunciation enter into the idea of eloquence.
Eloquence may be considered as consisting of
three kinds or degrees. T'he first and lomwest is
that which aims only to please the hearers.
Such in general, is the eloquence of panegyrics,
inaugural orations, addresses to great men, and
other harangues of this kind. This ornamental
sort of composition may innocently amuse and
entertain the mind, and may be mixed at the
same time with very useful sentiments. But it
must be acknowledged, that where the speaker
aims only to shine and to please, there is great
danger of artbeing strained into ostentation. and
of the composition becoming tiresome and insipid.
The second degree of eloquence is, when the
speaker aims, not merely to please, but also to
inform, to instruct and to convince; whes his
art.is employed in removing prejudices against
himselfand his cause; in selecting the most
peeper arguments, stating them with the great.
est force, arranging themn in the best order, expressing and delivering them with propriety andl
beauty;;thereby disposing us to pass that judgment, or favor that side of the cause, to which
he seeks to bring us. Within this degree chiefly
is employed the eloquence of the bar.
The third and highest degree of eloquence is
thatby,which we are not only convinced, but
interested, and agitated, and carried along with
the speaker.; our passions arise with his; weshiare alB his emotions; we love, we, bate, we
resent, as- he inspires. us: and are promp"ted t~o
resolve or to act, withi vigor and wartmth. Do._
bate in popular assemblies opens the mo-st extensive field to this species of' eloquenoce;' and
the pulpit also admits it.
This hiigh species oif eloque"nce is al.ways the
offspring of passion. By passion we mean that
state of tmind in whicih it i,, agitated and fired by
some object in view.  Hience the universally
acknowledged. power _of enthusiasm  in public

-In tracing -the origin) of V-loquien ce, it is not
necessary to go far back. in'to the early ages of
th-e world, or to searchi for it amontg the mnornimeats of eastern,- or Egyptian an'tiq/$ty.  In
those algqp, it is true,,there wa-s a certal"ri hind of
eloquence; but it was more nearly allied to poetry, than to whbat wve properly call oratory.

ELOQUENCE.2  OrIIGI  OF rELOQtENCE.
they were driven, not persuaded. Consequertly none of those refinements of society, which
make public speaking an object of importance,
were introduced.
Before the rise -of the -Grecian republics, we
perceive no remarkable appearances of eloquence, as the art ofpersuasionr; and thoRe gave
it such a:field, as it never had.before, and perhaps has never had again -since that time.-:Greece was divided into many little states.
These were governed at -first by kings; who
being for their tyranny successixely expelled
from: their dominions, there sprung up a multitude of democratical gonvernments, founded
nearly upon the same %plan, animated by the
same high spirit of freedom, mutually jealous,
and rivals of each other. Am-nong these Athens
was most noted for arts of every kind, but especially for eloqnence. ~We shall pass over the
orators, who:flourished in the iearly period of
this republic, arnd take a view of the great Demosthenes, in whom eloquence shone with unrivaIled splendor. Not formed by nature either
to please or,persuade, he struggled with, and
surmounted, the most formidable impediments.
Hie shut himself up in a cave, that he nmight
study withIess -distraction. He declaimed by
the seashore, -that -he might be used to the
noise of a tumultuous assembly; and with pebbles in his mouth, that he might correct a defect in his speech. He,practised at home with
a naked sword hanging over:his shoulder, that
he might check an ungraceful motion, to which
he was subject.  Hence the example of this
great mal affords the highest encouragement toDErTeSTHEZNE:.             153
every student of eloquence; since it shows how
far art and application availed for acquiring an
excellence, which nature appeared willing to
deny.
No orator had ever a finer field than Demosthenes in his Olynthiacs and Phillippics
which are his capital orations; and undoubted.
ly to the greatness of the subject, and to that
integrity and public spirit, which breathe in
them, they owve amuch of their merit. The ob.
ject is to rouse the indignation of his countrymen against Philip of Macedon, the public ernemy of the liberties of Greece; and to guard
them against the insidious measures, by which
that crafty prince endeavocred to lay them
asleep to danger. To attain this end, we see
him using every proper mean, to animate a peo.
pie distinguished by justice, humanity and valor; but in many instances become corrupt and
degenerate. He boldly accuses them of venality, indolence, and indifference to the public
cause; while at the same time he reminds
them of the glory of their ancestors, andl of
their present resources  Iis contemporary orators, who were bribed by Philip: and pe-rsuaded the people to peace, he openly reproaches,
us traitors to their country.  He not only
prompts to vigorous measures, but lays down
the plan of execution, His orations are strongly animated, and full of the impetuosity and fire
of public spirit. His composition is not distinguished by ornament and splendor. It is energy of thought, peculiarly his own, which forms
his character, and sets him above all others.
He seems not to attend to words, but to things,QUESSTIOS.
We forget the erator, and think of the su~bject..
le has no parade; Ino studied inttroductions-;
but is like a man full of his subject, who, after
preparing his audience by a sentence or two for
hearing plain truths, enters directly on business.
The style of Demosthenes is strong and concise; though-sometimes harsh and abrupt.  His
words are,very expressive, and his arrangement
firm and manly. Neglig,ent of little graces, he
aims at that sublime, whilch lies in sentiment.
His action and pronunciation were utcommonly
vehement and ardent.  His character is of the
austere, rather than ofthe gentle kind.  He is
always grave, serious, passionate.: never degrading himself,,nor attempting any thing like
pleasantry..if his admirable eloquence be in
any respect faulty, it is in this, he sometimes
borders on the hard and dry.     He may be
thought to want smoothness and grace;. which
is atlributed to his imitating too closely the manner of Thucydides, who wa. k.is great-model for
style,dand whose history he.transcribed eight
times with his own hand. Bult,these.defects are
more than compensated by that masterly force
of masculine eloquence, which, as it overpowered all who heard it, cannot in the present day
be read without emotion.

ROMAN ELOQUENCE. CICERO. MODERN
ELOQUENCE.
HAVING treated of eloquence among the
Greeks, we now proceed to consider its progress among, the Romans;: where we sbhall find
one md(lel at least of eloquence in its, most
splendid form. The Romans derived their eloquence, poetry and'learning, from the Greeks,
and were far inferior to them in genius for all
these  accomplishments:    They had    neither
their vivacity, nor sensibility-; their passions
were not so easily moved, nor their conceptions
so lively; in comparison with them, they were
a:phlegmatic people.  Their language resembled theircharacter; it was regular, firm and
startely; but wanted that exprlessive simplicit~y1 56              CIGERO.
that. flexibility to suit every different species of
composition, by which the Greek tongue is peculiarly distinguished, Hence we'always find
in Greek productions more native genius; in
Roman, mare regularity and art.
As the Roman government, during the republic, was of the popular kind, public speaking
early became the mean of acquiring power and
distinction. But ii the unpolished times of the
state, their speaking hardly deserved' the name
of eloquence. It was but a short time before
the age of Cicero, that the Roman orators rose
into any reputation. Crassas and Antonius seem
to have been the most eminent; but as none of
their works are extant; nor any of Hortensius's,
who was Cicero's rival at the bar, it is not necessary to transcribe what Cicero said of them,
and of the character of their eloquence.
The object most worthy of our attention, is
Cicero-himself;, whose name alone suggests every thing splendid in oratory.  With his life
and character in other respects, we ar.e not at
present concerned. We shall view him only as
aa eloquent speaker; and endeavour to mark
both his virtues and defects.  His virtues are
eminently great. In all his orations art is conspicuous. He begins commonly with a regular
exordium, and with much address, prepossesses
the hearers, and studies to gain their affections.
His method is clear, and his arguments arranged with' great propriety.  In clearness of
method, he has advatntage ever Demosthenes.
Every thing is in its proper place; he never
attempts to move before he has endeavoretd to
convince; and in moving, partic:ulariy the Softer~assions, he isvery successful. Na.one ever
knew the force of words better than Cicero.
Ie rolls them along with the greatest beauty.ind pbmp; and in.tbe structure of sentences, is
eminently curious and exact. He is always full
ad flo*ing; never abrupt. He amplifies eve,-ry thing;,yet, though his manner is on the
wvhble diffuse, it is often happily varied, and suit-'d to'the subject. When a great publjc object,roused his mind, and demanded indignation and
i-,r1ce, he departs considerably from that loose
-iJ declamatory -manner to which he at other
li:nes is addicted, and becomes very forcible and
techement.'Tlis great orator, however, is not without
d3efccts. In most of his orations, there is too
aucth art. He seems often desirous of obtainm:&gt;g u;dmiration rather than of operatitig convic-. on-. He is sometimes, therefore, showyv, rather!:,in solid; and diffuse where he ought to be ur-,:,.nt. His periods are always round and sonorous:
e',ey cannot be accused of monotony, for they
i.:ssess variety of cadence; but, from too great
i uindness for magnificence, he is sometimes de-;!,:jient in strength. Though the services which
t:-performed for his country were very considA.-d,ble, yet he is too much his own panegyrist.
*.-cient manners, which imposed fewer re-:, uaints on the side of decorum, may in some de- A:ee excuse, but cannot entirely justify.his van.
W"Vhether Demosthenes or Cicero were. the
-,,,.,st perfect oraior, is a question, on: which
-,itics are not agreed.. Fenelon, the celebrated
chbishop of Cambray, and author of TelemaO

a enius fer mathematics, as well as a genius.fsr poetry; a genius for war,for politics, or for
any mechanical employment.
Genius may be greatly improved by art and
study; but by them alone it cannot be acquired.
As it is a higher faculty than taste, it is ever,
according to the common frugality of nature,
more limited ia the sphere of its operations.
There are persons, not unfrequently Ito be miet,
who have an excellent taste in several'of the polite arts; such as, mtusic, poetry, painting, and
eloquence; but an excellent performer in all
these arts is very seldom found; or rather is
mot to be looked for. A universal genius, or
ene who is e.ually and indifferently inclined
towards several different professions and arts,
is not likelyto excel in any. Alfhough there
may be some few exceptions, yet in general it
is true, that, when the mind is wholly directed
towards some one object exclusively of others,
there is the fairest prospect of eminence in that,
whatever it may be. Extreme beat can be produced only when the rays converge to a single
point. Young persons are highly interested in
this remark; since it may teach them to examine with care, and to pursue with ardor, that
path which uatere has marked out for their peculiar exertions.
The nature of taste, the sature and immp{.
tance of criticism, and the distinction between
taste and genius, being thus explained, thesources of the pleasures of taste shall next be
considered.  Hiere a very extensive field is,
Gpened; no less, than all the pleasures of the

We shall translate the passage, though not, it is

orioginal. "I do not hesitate to declare." says
he," that I think Demostbenes superior to:Cicero. 1 am persuaded,no omle can admire Cicero more- thart I do.  He adorns whatever &gt;e
attempts. fie does honourto language. He
d'is.pses of words in a manner pecukiar to hin3self:  His style has great variety of character.,
Whenever he pleases, he is even conc.ise ad.4
vehementV; for instance against Cataline, agaist
Verres, against Anthony.  B3ut ornamerft is too
xisible in his ritings.  His art is wonderful,
but,it is perceived.  When the oratc' is providing f;,r the safety of the repuhlic, 1e forgets

elegance ofexpressio; unsought, he possesses
it. He is'superior to. adinra.tion. tle mnakes

only to cover him. He thunders,. he lightens.
He is a torrent, which carries evexy thing before it. \Ve cannot criticise, because we are
tnot ourselves. His,subject enchains our attention and makes us forget his language.  We
lose him from our sight; I'hilip alone occupies
our minds. I am delighted with both these orators; but I confess that I am less affected by
the, infinite art and wagnificent eloquence o'
Cicero. than by the rapis s:;jpli,city -f Demos:

ELOQUENC t OF THE BAR.
T'TEt ends of speaking at the bar, and in pop.
ular assemblies, are commonly different. In
the latter, the orator aims principally to persnade; to determine his hearers to some choice
or conduct, as good, fit, or useful. He therefore
applies himself to every principle of action in
our nature; to the passions and to the heart, as
well as to the understanding. But at the bar,
conviction is the principal object. There the
speaker's duty is not to persuade the judges to
what is good or useful, but to exhibit what is
just and true; and, consequently, hif eloquence
is chiefly addressed to the understanding.
At the bar speakers address themselves to
one, or to a few j-udges, n ho are generally persons -of age, gravity, and dignity of character.
There those advantages, which a.mixed and
numerous assembly affords for employing all
the arts of speech, areJ not enjoined. Passion
does not rise so easily. TI'be speakr is beard
with more coolness; he is watched with more
severity; and would expose himself to ridicule
by attempting that high and vehement tone
which is suited only to a multitude. Beside at
the bar the fieldeof speaking is confined within
law and statute. Imaginaticn is fettered., The
advocate has always before him the line, the
square, and the compass. These it is his cliief
business to be.onstant!y applying to the sub.
jects under debate.
Hence, the eloquence of thle bor is of a-much
more limited,   more sober, and. c:l.tened
kind,, tian thiat of popular assemb1lie,, an`,

work, that all the.e be examiaed fully: the
pleasure which we receive from discourse or
writing  being the principal obI3ject of them.
Or:es.ign is to give some opening into the
pIleaares of taste in general, and to insist more
partictlarly upou sublinmity and beauty.
We are far from having yet attained any system concerning this subject. A regular inquiky
into it was first attempted by Mr. Addison, in
hia essay on the Pieasrves of the Imagination.
By him these pleasures are ranged under three
heads, beauty, grandeur and novelty. His specn latio-6as on this subject, if not iemnarkably irofoinrd, are very beautifiul and entertaining; and
he has the merit of having diswovered a track,
wh,ch was before untrodden. Since his time,
the advances made in this part of philosophic
al crificism are considerable; which is owitng,
doaytless, to that thinness and- subtility, which
ae doscovered to be properties of all the feelir?s of ta4le. It is difl-.ult to enumerate the

ancients must not be considered as exact nmodels
of that kind of speaking'which is adapted to the
present state of ibe bar. Vith the i,'strict laiv
was much less an object of attention t'han it is
with us. In the days of Demosthenes and Cicero, the municipal statutes were -few, simple,
and general; andithe decision of causes was
left, in a great meastire, to the equity and common sense of the judges.  Eloquence, rather
than jurisprudence, was the stuily of pleaders.
Cicero says that three  mionths' study would
m.ke a complete civilian; nay, it was thought
that a man might be a good pleader without any
previous study. Among the Romans there was
a set of men, called progmiatici, whose office it
was to supply the crator with all the law knowledge his cause required; which he disposed in
that popular formth and decorated wilh- those
colors of eloquence, vihich were most fitted for
influencing the judges.
It mayalso be observed. that the civil and
criminal judges in Greece and Rom@e l-ere m;ore
numerous than with us, and formed a kind of
popular assembly. The celebrated tribunal of
the Areopagus, at Athens, consisted of fifty
judges at least. In Rome, the Jntdices Scle,;i
were always numerous, and had the office aid
power ofjudge and jury. In the famous cause
fgMilo, Cicero spoke to fifty. one Judices Selecti,
and thus had the advantage of addiessing his
tbhole pleading, not.o one or as iew learne(d
judges of the point of law, as is the case with
Us, but'to' an assen.mbly of Ro-muan citizens.Hence lthoe arts of popular eloquence u hich he
iemplOyd with.uch, uccecs.  lience? certa:inELOQUENGCE OF TH.E BAR.
practices which would be reckoned theatrical
by us, were common at the Roman bar; such as
introducing not only the accused person dressed
in deep mourning, but presenting to the judges'his faimily and young children, endeavoring to
excite pity by their cries and tears.
The foundation of a lawyer's reputation and
success must be laid in a profound knowledge of
his profession. If his abilities as a speaker be
ever so eminent; yet, if his knowledge of the
law besuperficial, few will choose to ergage
him in their defence. Beside previous study, and
an ample stock of acquired knowledge, another
thing, inseparable from the success of every
pleader, is a diligent and painful attention to every cause with which he is entrusted; to all
the lacts and circumstances with which it is con.
nected. Thus he will, in a great measure, be
prepared for the arguments of his opponent;
and, being previously acquainted with the weak
parts of his own cause, he will be able to fortify
them in the best manner against the attack of
his adversary.
Though the ancient popular and vehement
manner of pleading is now in a great nmeasuie
su.sperseded, we must not infer that there is no
room for eloquence at the bar, and that the
study of it is superfluous.  There is, perhaps,
no scene of public speaking, where eloquence
is more requisite. T'he drI yness and subtility of
subjects usually agitated at the bar, require,
more than any other, a certain kind of eloquence, in order to command attention; to give
weight t o the arguments employed; and to pitevent what the pleader advances from passing
P
16&amp;170        ELOQUENCE o0 THE BAr.
unregarded. The effect of good speaking is
always great. There is as much difference in
the impression made by a cold, dry, and confused speaker, and that made by one who pleads
the same cause with   elegance, order, and
strength, as there is between our conception of
an object when presented in twilight, and when
viewed in the effulgence of noon.
Putrity and neatness of expression is in this
species of eloquence chiefly to be studied; a
style perspicuous and proper; not needlessly
overcharged with the pedantry of law terms,
nor affectedly avoiding these, when suitable
and requisite. Verbosity is a fault of which
men of this profeSsion are frequently accused;
into which the habit of speaking and writing
hastily and with little preparation, almost unavoidably betrays them. It cannot therefore, be
too earnestly recommended to those who are
beginning to practice at the bar, that they earlyguard against this, while they have leisure
for preparation. Let them form themselves to
the habit of a strong and correct style; which
will become natural to them afterward, when
compelled by multiplicity of business to compose
with precipitation. Whereas, if a loose and
negligent style have been suffered to become
familiar, they will not be able even upon occasions when they wish to make an unusual effort,
to express themselves with force and elegance.
Distinctness in speaking at the bar is a capital property. It should be shown, first iu stating the question; in exhibiting clearly the
point in debate; what we admit; what we deny;
and where the line of division begins betweenELOQUENCE OF THE BAR.            171
us and the adverse party. Next, it should appear in the order and arrangement of all the
parts of the pleading. A clear method is of the
highest consequence in every species of oration;
but in those intricate cases which belong to the
bar, it is infinitely essential.
Narration of facts should always be as concise as the nature of them  will admit. They
are always very necessary to be remembered;
consequentlg, unnecessary minuteness in relating them overloads the memory. Whereas, if
a pleader omit all superfluous circumstances in
his recital, he adds strengtlh to the material facts,
gives a clearer view of what he relates, and
makes the impression of it more lasting. In
argumentation, hoivever, a more diffuse manner
seems requisite at the bar than on some other
occasions. For in popular assemblies, where
the subject of debate is often a plain question,
arguments gain strength by conciseness. But
the intricacy f flaw points frequently requires
the arguments to be expanded and placed in
different lights, in order to be fully apprehended.
Candor in stating the arguments of his adversary cannot be too much recommended to every
ple.ader. lf he disguise them, or place them in
a false liglhtthe artifice will soon be discovered;
and the judge and the hearers will conclude,
that he either wants discernment to perceive,
or fairness to admit, the strength of his optpo.
tient's reasoning. But, if he state with accuracy and candor the arguments use(t against him,
before he endeavor to combat them, a strong
prejudice is created in his favcr.  Hte will ap17if 2  ~QUESTvO.NS
pear to have entire confidence in his causes
since he does not altempt to support it by artifice or concealment.'.he judge will therefore
be inclined to receive more readily the impressions made upon hima by a speaker who appears both fair and penetrating.
Wit may sometimes be serviceable at the bar,
particularly in a lively reply, by which ridicule
is thrown on what an adversary has advanced.
But a young pleader should never rest his
strength on this dazzling talent.  His office is
not to excite laughter, but to produce coU:viction; nor perhaps did any one ever rise to -eminence in his profession by being a witty lawyer.
Since an advocate personates his client, he
must plead his cause with a proper degree of
warmth.   He must be cautious, however, of
prostituting his earnestness and sensibility by an
equal degree of ardor on every subject. There
isa dignity of character, which it is highly important for every one of his profession to support. An opitnion of probity and honor in a
pleader is his most powerful instrument of persuasion. He should aiways, therefore, decline
enmbarking in causes which are odious and manifestly unjust; and when he supports a doubtful
cause, he should lay the chief stress upon those
arguments which appear to him to be tnost forcible; reserving his zeal and indignation for
cases where injustice and iniquity are flagrant.

ELOQUENCE OF TIlE PULPIT.
HAVING treated of the eloquence of popillar assemblies, anjd of that of the bar, we shall
now consider the strain and spirit of' tha;t eloquence which     is suited to the pulpit.  Tiis
field of public speaking has seveiral advantages
peculiar to itself:  The dignity anId importance
of its subjects must be allowed to bIe s3uperior to
any other. They admit the highest embellish.
ment in description, and lhe greatest warmth
and vdhemence of expression.     In treating  his
subject, the preacher has also peculiar advantages. He speaks not to one, or a fewv judges,
P2
173i P         LT EtlO tCCE, OF T-H P ULTPIT.
but to a large assembly.  Tie is not afraid of
interruption. He chooses his subject at leisure; and has'all the assistance of the'most accurate  premeditation.  The disadvantages,
however, which attend the eloquence of the
pulpit are not inconsiderable.  The preacher, it is true, has no contention with an adversary; but debate awakens genius, and ex-,cites attention. HIis subjects, though nobie, are
trite and common. They are becomxe so iaamiliar to the public ear, that it requires no ordinary  genius in the preacher to fix attention.
Nothing is more difficult than to bestow on what
is cdmmon the grace of novelty. Besides, the
subject of the preacher usually confines him t
abstract qualities, to virtues and vices; whereas, that of other popular speakers leads them to
treat of persons; which is generally.more interesting to the hearers, and occupies more
powerfully the imagination. We are taught by
the preacher to detest only the crime.; by the
pleader to detest the criminal.  Hence it happens that, though the number of moderately
good preachers is great, so few have arrived at
eminence.  Perfection is very distant from
modern prea6hing.   The olbject however, is
truly noble, and worthy of being pursued with,zeal.
To excel in preaching, it is necessary to have
a fixed.and habitual view of its object. This is to
persuade men to become good. Every sermon
ought therefore to be a persuasive oration.  It
is not to discuss some abstruse point, that the
preacher ascends the pulpit. It is not to teach
his bearers something new; but to make them.,, ENCE OF TUE PULPIT.
better; to give them at once clear views aqd
persuasive impressions of religious truths.'The principal characterestics of pulpit eloquence, as distinguished from the other --kinds of
publi.c speaking, appear to be these two, gravity
and warmth.  It is neither easy norcommon to
unite these characters of eloquence. T.he
grave, when it is predominant, becomes a dull,
uniform solemnity. The warm, when it wants
gravity, borders on the light and theatrical. A
proper union of the two, forms that character
of preaching which the French call Onctionn;
4hat affecting, penetrating, and interesting manner, which flows from  a strong sense in the:preacher of the importance of the truths he
delivers, and an earnest desire that they may,make -full impression on:the hearts of his hear-,ers.
A sermon, as a.particular species of composition, requires the strictest attention to unity.'By this we mean that there should be some
main point to wlhich the whole tenor of.the
-serrmon shall refer. It must not be a pile of
different subjects lheaped upot each other; but
one object must predom-inate through the whole.
Hence, however, it must not be understood,,that there should be rio divisions or separate
heads in a discourse; nor that one single thought
only should be exhibited An different points of
view. Unity is not to be understood in so limited a sense; it admits some variety; it requires
only that union and,connection be so far preserved, as to make the whole concur in some
one impression on the mind. Thus, for instance,
a preacher may employ several different argoa1_7576.       ELOQUEN'CE OF THE PULPIT.
ments to enforce the love of God; he may also
inquire into the causes of the decay of this virtue; still one great object is presented to the
mind. But if, because his text says,'" He that
loveth God, must love his brother also;" he
should, therefore, mix in the same discourse
argulments for the love of God, and for the love
of our neighbor, he would grossly offend against
unity, and leave a very confused impression on
the minds of his hearers.
Sermons are always more striking, and generally more "lseful, the more precise and particular the subject of them is. Unity can never be
so perfect in a general, as in a particular subject.
General subjects, indeed, such as the excellency or the pleasures of Religion, are often cho,
sen by young preachers, as the most showy, and
the easiest to be handled; but these subjects
produce not the high effects of preaching. Attention is much more commanded, by taking
some particular view of a great subject, and
employing, on that, the whole force of argument and eloquence. To recommend some one
virtue, or inveigh against a particular vice, affords a subject not deficient in unity or precision.
But, if that virtue or vice be considered as assuming a particular aspect in certain characters,
or certain situations in life, the subject becomes
still more interesting. The execution is more
difficult, but the merit and the effect are higher.
A preacher should be cautious not to exhaust
his subject; since nothing is more opposite to
persuasion, than unnecessary and tedious fulness.
There are always sonle things which he may'ZLOqUENCE OR THE PUI;n T.;uppose to be known, and'some which require
-only brief attention. If he endeavor to omit
notlhing which his subject suggests, he mutt unavoidably encumber it and diminish its force.
To render his instructions interesting to his
-hearers should be the grand object of every
preacher.  He should   bring home to their
hearts the trut,hs which he inculcates; and make
each suppose himself particularly addressed.
fle should avoid all intricate reasonings;,avoid.expressing himself in general, speculative prop.
ositions; or laying down practical truths in aA
abstract, metaphysical manner.  A discourse
-ought to be carried on in the strain of-directs
address to the audience; not in the strain of one
writing an essay, but of one speaking to a mul
titude, and studying to connect what is called application, or what immediately refers to practice, width the doctrinal parts of the sermon.
It is always highly advantageous to keep in
-view the different ages, characters, and conditions of men, and to accommodate directions
aand exhortations to each of these different clas-ses. Whenever you advance what touches a
man's character or is-applicable to his circum-:stances, you are sure of his attention. No study
is more necessary far a preacher than the study
of human lite, and of the human heart.  To
discover a man to himself in a light, in which
he never-saw his character before, produces a
wonderful effect. Those sermons, though the
most difficult in composition, are not only the,most beautiful, but also the most useful, whichare founded on the illustration of some peculiar;character, or remarkable piece g' history in tkebeauity, which we discern in them;hbut, w bern

enquire wyhy regul'irity and''ariety pouei
our miinds the sensation of beauty; any r u1-SOR
we can as5sign is extremely imperfect. Those

It is some consolation, however,that althodgOh
the eff-icient cause is,o'bscure, the final cause'of
those sensatioins lies commonly mnore open; and
here we must observ'e the strong im'presision,

sacred writings; by pursuing which we may
trace, and lay open, some of the most secret
windings of the human heart.  Other topics
of preaching are become trite; but this is an
extensive field which hitherto has been little
explored, and possesses all the advantages of
being curious, new, and highly useful. Bishop
Butler's sermon on the character of Balaam  is
is an example of this kind of preaching.
Fashion, which operates so extensively on humnan manners, has given to preaching, at differ.
ent times, a change of character. This however is a torrent, which swells to-day and subsides to-morrow. Sometimes poetical preaching is fashionable; sometimes philosophical.
At one time it must be all pathetic; at another,
all argumentative; as some celebrated preacher
has set the example. Each of these modes is
very defective; and he, who conforms himself
to it, will both confine and corrupt his genius.
~Truth and good sense are the sole basis, ont

should be servilely imitated. From various examples the preacher may collect materials for
improvement; but servility of imitation extinguishes all genius, or rather proves entire

CONDUCT     OF   A DISCOURSE IN ALL ITfS
PARTS. INTRODUICTION, DIVISION, NARRATION, AND EXPLICATION.
HAVING already considered what is pecu.
liar to each of the three great fields of public
speaking, popular aVsemblies, the bar, and the
pulpit; we shall now treat of what is common
to them all, and explain the conduct of a discourse or oration in general.
The parts which compose a regular oration
are these six; the exordium  or introduction;
the state or division of the subject; narration
or explication; the reasoning or arguments;
the pathetic part; and the conclusion. It is
not necessary that each of these enter into every public discourse, nor that they *always enter
in this order.  There are many excellent dis.

courses in which some of these parts are omit.
ted. But, as they are the constituent parts of
a regular oration, and as in every discourse some
of them must occur, it is agreeable to our present purpose to examine each of them distinctly.
The design of the intrOduction is to conciliate
the good will of the hearers; to excite their
attention; and to render them open to persuasion. When the speaker is previously secure
of the good will, attention and docility of his audience; a formal introduction may be omitted.
Respect for his hearers will in that case require
only a short exordium, to prepare them for the
other parts of his discourse.
The introduction is a part of a discourse
which requiresno small care. It is always important to begin well; to make a favorable impression at firstsetting out, when the minds of
the hearers, as yet vacant and free, are mere
easily prejudiced in favor of the speaker. We
must add, also, that a good introduction is frequently found to be extremely diflicult. Few
parts of a discourse give more trouble to the
composer, or require more delicacy in the exe--
eutionm
-An introduction should' -be' easy and' natural;
rt should always be suggested by the subject.
The' writer should not plan it before he,has
meditatedin his own mind the substance of his~
discourse. By taking the opposite course, and
composing- i the first place an introduction, the
writer will often find that he is either led to lay
hold of some' co-mmaon-place topic, or that instead of the introduction being accommodated'
to the ditcourse, he is under the necessity offlrao15ctTIOf.     1        8
accommodating the discourse to the introduction.
In this part of a discourse correctness of expressionshould be carefully studied.--This is
peculiarly requisite, on account of the situation of
the hearers. At the beginniug, they are more
disposed to criticise, than at any other pericd;
they are then occupied by the subject and the
arguments; their attention is entirely directed
to the speaker's style and manner. Care therefore is requisite to prepossess them in his favor;
though too much art must be cautiously avoided,
since it will then be more easily detected, and
will derogate from that persuasion, which the
other parts of the discourse are intended-to produce.
Modesty is also an indispensable characteristic
of a good introduction. If the speaker begin
with an air of arrogance and ostentation, the
self-lonre and pride of his hearers will be presently awakened, and follow hinr with a very
suspicious eye through the rest of his discourse.
His modesty should appear not only in his expression, but in his whole manner; in his looks,
in his gestures, and in the tone of his voice.
Every audience is pleased with those marks of
respect and awe which are paid by the speaker.
The modesty, however, of an introduction
should betray nothing mean or abject. Together with modesty and deference to his hearers,
the orator should show a certain sense of dignity, arising from persuasion of the justice or importance of his subject.
Particular cases excepted, the orator should
not put forth all his strength at the beginning;
but itshould rise an grow upon hi his hearer  as
q   3~~~~4L ~~iis discourse advances. The introduction is
seldom the place for vehemence and passion.
The audience must be gradually prepared before
thespeaker venture on strong and passionate
sentiments. Yet, when the subject is such that
the:very mention of it naturally awakens some
passionate emotion; or, when the unexpected
presence of some person or object in a popular
assembly inflames the speaker; either of these
willj:ustifyr an abrupt and vehement exordium.
Thlus the appearance of Cataline in the senate
renders the violent o)ening of Cicero's first oratin-agaipst him very natural and proper "Quousque tandetm, C-aatalin  abutere patientia nostra?"
Bishop Atterbury, preac-hing- from this text,
" Blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended
in me," ventures on this bold exordium: " And
can any man then be offended in thee; blessed
Jesus??"  Which address to our--Saviour he con..
tinues, till he enters on the division qf his- shub
ject. But such introductions should be; attempted by very few, since they promise so much
vehemence and ardor through the rest of- the
discourse, that it is extremely difficult to satis.fy the expectation of the hearers. An introduction should not anticipate any material part
of the subject.  When topics or arguments,
which are afterwards to be enlarged upon, are
hinted]at and in part exhibited in the introduction; they lose, upon their second appearance,
the grace of novelty.  The impression intended to be' made by any capital- thought is always nlade with greatest advantage when it is
made entire, and in its proper place.
Au introduction should be proportioned in
length and kind to the discourse which followsDIYISION.              ~ 8~

After the. introduction, the proposition or
-enunciati-on of the subject commonly succeeds;
concerning which Ve shall only observe, that it
should be clear and distinct, and expressed
withont affectation, in the most concise and simple manner;. To'this generally succeeds the
division, orlaying down the method of the discourse; in the management of which the following rules should be carefully observed.
First, The parts into which the subject is di~vided, must be really distinct from each other.
It were an absurd division, for example, if a
speaker should propose to explain first the ad-,vantages of virtue, and next those of justice or
temperance; because the first head plainly
comprehends the secotnd, as a genus does the
species.  Such a method of proceeding involves the subject in confusion.
Secondly, We must be careful always to follow the order of nature; beginning with the
most simple points; with such-as are most easily understood, and necessary to be first discussed; and proceeding to those which are built
upon the former, and suppose them to be known.
The subject must be divided into those parts,
into which it is most easily and naturally resolved.
Thirdly, The members of a division ouglt to
exhaust the subject; otherwise the division is184       NAItRATION OR EXPLTCATION.
incomplete; the subject is exhibited by pieces
only, without displayin~gthe whole.
Fourthly, Let conciseness and precision be
peculiarly studied. A division always appears
to most advantage, when the several heads are
expressed in the clearest, most' forcible, and
fewest words possible. This never fails to
strike the hearers agreeably; and contributes
also to make the divisions more easily remembered.
Fifthly, Unnecessary multiplication of heads
should be cautiously avoided. To divide a supject into many minute parts, by endless divisions
and subdivisions, produces a bad effect in speakirg. In a logicaltreatise this may be proper;
but it renders an oration hard and dry, and unnecessarily fatigues the memory.  A sermon
may admit from three to five or six heads, including subdivisions; seldom are more allowable.
The next constituent part of a discourse is
narration or explication. These two are joined
together, because they fall nearly under the
same rules, and because they generally answer
the same purpose; serving to illustrate the
cause, or the subject, of which one treats, before proceeding to argue on one side or the other; or attempting to interest the passions of the
hearers.
To be clear and distinct, to be probable, and
to be concise, are the qualities, which critics
chiefly require in narration. Distinctness is requisite to the whole of the discourse, but belongs especially to narration, which ought to
throw light on all that follows. At the bar, a
fact, or a single circumstance, left in obscurity,NARRATIONr OR EXPLItATION.     18I:,or misunderstood by the judge, may destroy the,effect of all the argument and reasoning, which
the pleader employs. If his narration be improbable, it will be disregarded; if it be - tedious and diffuse, it will fatigue and be forgotten.
To rerder narration. distinct, particular attention is requisite in awcertaining clearly the
names, dates, places and every other important
circumstance ot the facts recounted. In order
to be probable in narration, it is necessary to exhibit the characters of the, persons of wherm
we speak, and to show that their actions proceeded from such motives as are natural, and
likely to gain belief, To be as concise as the sub
ject will admit, all superfluous circumstances
must be rejected; be which the narration will
be rendered more forcible at.,d more ciear.
In sermons, ecplication of the subject to be
discoursed on occupies the place of narration at
the bar, and is to be conducted in a si rmiler manner. It must be concise, clear, and diitinct; in
a style correct and elegant, ratther than highly
adorned. T_'o explain the doctrine of the text
with propriety; to give a full and clear account
of' the nature of that virtue or duty w,hich forms
the subject of discourse, is properly the didactic part of preaching; on the right execution
of which much depenrds. In order to succeed,
the preacher must meditate profoundly on the
subject; so as to place.it in a clear aod strikling
point of view. He must consider what light it
may derive from other passages of scripture;
whether it be a subject nearly allied to some
other, from which it ought to he distinguished;
whether it can be advartageously illustrated by
eomparing or opposing, it to some other thing;
q21ab                OUESTION?S.
by searching into causes, or tracing effects; by
pointing out examples, or appealing to the
hearts of the hbearers; that thus a precise and
circumstantial view may be afforded of the doctrine inculcated.  By distinct and apt illustrations of the known truths of religion, a preacher may both display great merit, as a composer;
and what is infinitely, more valuable, render
his discourses weighty, instructive, and useful.

TIlE  ARGUMENTATIVE PART OF A DIS.
COURSE. TItE PATHIETIC PART, AND
THE PERORATION.
AS the great end for which men speak on
any serious occa:3ion, is to convince their hearers that sonmthing is true, or right, or good,
and thus to influence their practice; reason and
argrunment must constitute the foundation of all
manly and persuasive eloquence.
With regar(d to arguments, three tbi!igs are
requisite. First, invention of them; secondly,
proper disposition and arrangement of them;
and thirdly, expressing them in the most forcible manner.   Invention  is undoubtedly the
most material, and the basis of the rest. But
in this, art can afford only small assistance., It
can aid a speaker however in arran.ging andl
expressing those arguments which his knowledge of the subject has discovered.
Supposing the arguments properly chosen,
we must avoid blend,ng those together that
are of a separate nature.  411 arguments whatever are  intended to prove onre  of these
three things; that something is true; that it is
right orfit; or that it is profitable and good.
Truth, duty, and interest are the three great
subjects of discussion among men. Bu)t the arguments emploved upon either of them are
generally distinct; and he, who blends them all
under one topic, which he calls his argument,
as in sermons is too frequently done,will render
his reaaoning indistinct and inelegant.
With respect to the different degrees of
strength in arguments, the comnmon rule is, to
advance in the way of climax from the weakest
to the most foicible.  This method is recomSIJBTAMIITY III 0 RICT5S                    1

mended when the speaker is cotnvinced that his
cause is clear, and easy to be proved. But this
rule must not be universally observed. If he
distrust his cause, and have but one material argument, it is often proper to place this argument in the front; to prejudice his hearers
early in his favor, and thus dispose them to pay
attention to the weaker reasons which he may
afterwards introduce. When anmid a variety of
arguments there is one or two more feeble than
the rest, though proper to be used, Cicero advises to place them in the middle, as a situation
less conspicuous, than either the beginning or
enld of the train of reasoning.
Wher arguniments are strong and satisfactory,
the more they are separated the better. Each
can then bear to be introduced alone, placed in
its full light, amplified and contemp!ated. But,
when they are of a doubtf,il or presumptive nat.
ure, it is safer to crowd them together, to form
them into a phalanx, that, though individually,weak, they may mutually support each other.
Arguments should never be extended too far,,nor multiplied too much. This serves rather
to render a cause suspicious, than to increase its
strength. A needless multiplicity of arguments
burdens the memory, aud diminishes the weight
of that conviction, wlich a few well chosen arguments produce. To expand them   also beyond the bounds of reasonable illustration is always enfeebling. When a speaker endeavors
to expose a favorable argument in every ligh-t,possible, fatigued by the effort, he loses the
spirit, with which he set out; and ends with
feebleness, what he began with force.
Having attended thus far to the proper arPATHETIST PART OF A DISCOURSE.   ]
rangement of arguments, we proceed to another essential part of a discourn,e, the pathetic;
in which, if any where, eloquence reigns, and
exerts its power  On this head the following
directions apppear usettil.
Consider carefully whether the subject admit
the pathetic, aud render it proper; and, if it
do, what part of the discourse is most fit for it.
To   determnane these polnts belongs to good
sense. Many subjects admit not the pathetic;
and even in those, that are susceptible of it, an
attemnpt to excite the passions in a wrong place,
may exp,!,e an orator to ridicule. It may in
general the observed, that, if we expect any emotion, which we raise, to have a lasting effect,
we must secure in'our favor the understanding
and judgment. The hearers must be satisfied,
that there are sufficient grounds for theirengaging in the cause with zeal and ardor. When
arguomernt and reasoning have produced their
full effect, the pathetic i. admitted with the
greatest force and propriety.
A speaker should cautiously avoid giving his
hearers tvarnling that heintends to excite their
passi,ns. Every thing.  this kind chills their
sensiiliity. There is also a great diffeience Itetweun tellinDg the hearers'that they ought to be
moved. atnd actually moving them.'To every
emotion or passion, nature las adapted certain
corresponding  objeets; aind without setting
these betfie the mind. it is imnt,ossible for an orator to excite that emotion, We a'e warmried

our iddifference and coldness.  Hitherto he hRa
addressed only our reason or conscience. He
must describe the kindness and tenderness of
our friend; he must exhibit the distress suffered
by the person for whotn he would interest us.
Then, and not before, our hearts begjin to be
touched, our gratitude, our compassion, begins
to flow. The basis, therefore, of all successful
execution in pathetic oratory,:is to paint the object of that passion which we desire to raise in
the most natural and striking manner; to describe it with such circumstances as are likely
to awaken it in the minds 6f others.
To succeed in the pathetic, it is necessary to
attend to the proper language of the passions.
This, if we consult nature, wve shall ever find is
unafficted and simple. It may be animated by
bold and strong figures, but it will have no ornament, no finery. There is a great differenee
between painting to the imagination and to the
heart. The one may be done with deliberation
and coolness; the o-ttier must always be rapid
and ardent. In the former, art and labor may
be suffered to appearrq in the latter, no proper
effect can be produceds4 unless it be the work of
nature only.  -leaLce all,digressions shonld be
avoided which may interrupt or turn aside the
swell of passion. Hence comparisons are always-dangerous, and commonly quite imnproper
in the midst of the pathetic. It is also to be ob-.
served, that violept emotions cannot be lasting.
TL'he pathetic therefore should not be proloImged
too much. Due regard should always be pre.
served to what the hearers wvill bear; for, lihe
who attempts to carry them farther in passions
*han they will follow him, frustrates his i)ur.pose. By endeavoring to warm them tot tnuch,
he takes the surest method of freezing them
completely.
Concerning the peroration or conclusion Gof a:
discourse, a few words will be sufficient. Sometimes the whole pathetic part comes in most
properly at the conclusionr  Someti;nes, when
the discourse has been altogether argumentative, it is proper to'conclude with summing up
the arguments, placing them in one view, andt
leaving the impression of them ftull and strong,
on the minds of the hearers. For the great
rule of a conclusion, and what nature obviously suggests. is, place that' last on. wihich yous
choose to rest the strength of your cause.
In every kind of public speaking it -is importantto hint the precise time of concluding; to
bring the discourse just to a point; neither ending abruptly and unexpectedly, nor disappointing the expectation of the hearers, when they
lbok for the' end of the discourse.
The speaker should always close with dignity
and spirit, that the minds of the hearers may be
left warm, and that they may depart with a favorable imrfession of the subject- and' of: himself.

PRO)NUNCIATION OR DELIV FRY.
THE great objects to which every phlTic
speaker should direct his attention, in f~r:niiag
his delivery, are, first,to speak so as to be fully
and easily understood by his hearers; and next,
to express himself with such grace and energy,
as to please and to move them.
ro he fully and easily understood, the chief
requisites are, a due degree of louidness ot'voice,
distinctness, slowness, and propriety of pronunciation.
To be heard is undoubtedly the first requisite.
The speaker must endeavor to fill with his
voice the space  occupied by the assembly.
Though this power of voice is in a gv'eat measure a natural talent, it may receive considerable
assistance from art. Much depends on the proper
pitch and management of the voice. -Every
man has three pitches in his voice; the high,
the middle, and the low. The high is used in
calling aloud to some one at a distance; the
lo,v approaches to a whisper; the middle is
that, wvhich is employed in common conversa.
tion, and which should generally be used in
public speaking. For it is agreat error to suppose, that the highest pitch of the voice is requisite, to be well heard by a great assembly.
This is confounding two things materially different, loadness or strength of sound, with the
keyornote on which we speak. The voice
may be rendered louder without altering the
key; and the speaker will always be able to
give most body, most persevering force of
sound, to that pitch of voice, to which, in conversation, he is accustomed.  Whereas, if he
begin on the highest key, he will fatigue himPRONIUCTIA TION OR' DELIVERY.

therefore, full strength and sw(ell (of slt, lhut
always pitch it on your ordinarv spiAk,ng key;
~ greater quantity of voice shouid never be
uttered, than can be afforded without piun, ad;d
without ar extraordinary effort. To be well
heard, it is usefuil for a speaker to fix his eye on
some of the most distant persons in the assembly, and to consider himself as speaking to
them., We naturally and mechanically utter
our words with such strength, as to be heard by
one, to whom we address ourselves, provided
he be within the reach of our voice. This is
the case in public speaking, as well as in common conversation. But it must be remembered,
that speakingf too loudly-is peculiarly offensive.
The ear is wounded, when the voice comes upon it, in rumbling, indistinat masses; besile,
it appears, as if assent were demanded, by
mere vehemence and torce of sound.
To being well heard, and clearly understood,
distinctness of articulation is mere conducive,
perhaps, than mere loudness of sound. The
quantity of sound, requisite to fill even a large
space, is less than is commonly supposed; with
distinct articulation, a man of a weak voice will
make it extend farther, than the strongest voice
can reach without it. This therefore demands
peculiar attention. The speaker must give everysound its due proportion, and make every
syllable,and even every letter be heard distinctly. To succeed in this, rapidity of prontinciation  must be avoided.  A lifeless, (rawling

vhico) thie nature of these pauses is intimated

In reading or reciting verse,there is a pecuiliar
dlificuity in making the pauses with prop-riety.''tlere are twv-o kinds of pauses, whibich belong to
the mutsic of verse; one at the end of a line,
reid the other in the middle of it.'Rhytne a.ways renders the former sensible, andl compels

no suspension of the sense, it has been doubted,
vhether in reading such ver.:-, any regar,d
should be paid to the close of a line. On the
stage, indeed, where ttie appearance of speaking in verse sthould be avoided, the close of such
lines as make no pause in the sense, should not
be renderel  perceptible to the ear. On otner
occasions, we ought, for the sake of melody,
to read blank verse in such manner, as to mafke
each line sensible to the ear. In attempting

consequently been eve,r considered as one of the
most striking and magrificent spectacles, which
can be either presented to the eye, or exhibited to the imagination in description.
All ideas of the solemn and awful kind, and
even bordering on the terrible, tend greatly to
assist the sublitnme such as darkliness. solitude
and silence. The firmament, when filled with
stars, scattered in infinite numbers and with
splendid profuision, strikes the imagination with
more awful grandeur than when we belhold it
enlightened by all the splendor of the sun.'
The deep sound of a great hell, or the striking
of a great clock, is at any time grand and awful;
but when heard amid the silence and stillness of
night, they become doubly so. Darkness is
yery generally applied for adding sublimity to
all our ideas of the Deityv. "He maketh
darkness his pavilion; he dwelleth in the thick
cloud." Thus Milton
Holw oft ani(i'rhi-k clouds andt darkic does heaven's all-ruling Sire

And with the majesty of darkness round

Obscurity is favorable to the sublime.-The
descriptions given us of appearances of supernatural beings carry some sublimity; though
the conception, which they afford us, be confused and indistinct. Their sublimity arises from
the ideas which they always couvey of superior power and might cornected with awful obscurity. No ideas, it is evident, are so sublimes
as those derived from the Supreme Being, the
most unknown, yet the greatest of all objects;
the infinity of whose nature and the eternity of0s8       PRON'UNCITAT'IUUT TON OR DEI3VEIRY.
and tone must be cautinousi avoided. Tlhe close
of a line, where there is no pause in the meaning, should be marked onry by so slight a suspension of:sound. as may distinguish the passage
frormt one line to another, without injuring the
sense.
The pause in the middle of the line falls after
the 4th, otl, 6ti, oxr 7th syllable, and no other.
When this pause coinCrI..s with the slighte-st di.

But if worids, t,h;t haive so intimate a cOnnection, as not to adr'it even a momentary separation, be divided illom each otler by this coesural
pause; we then perceive a cot.flict between
the sense and sound, w hich renders it (lifficult
to read s-ich lines gracefully.  In' such cases it
is best to sac rifice sound to sense. Foe instance,
in the fo,liosvwig liones of Milton:

also in the following line of Pope's Epistle to
Arbuthnot:
I sit; with sadcivility I read.
The ear points out the pause as falling after
"sad," the fiJurth syllable.  But to separate
"sad" and "civiiity" wvculd be very bad reading.
T'he sense allows no other pause than after theJ.RONINCITION OR t ELIVLRV-.  190
second syllable,'s4it;" which, therefore, is the
~eonly one to be observed.
We procced to *reat of tones in pronunciawiot, which are difterent both from  emphasis
-and pauses; consisting in the modulation of the
voice, tie notes or variations of sound which
are employed in public speaking. The most,mnaterial instruction which can h)e given on this
~s,ibject, is to form the tones of public speaking
Ul'mn" the tones of animat ed conversation. Every one, who is engaged in speaking on the sub&gt;ect which interests Jhim nearly, has an eloquent,
or persuasive tone and m;anner. 3But, when a
speaker departs from his natural tone of expression. he becomes fiigitand aupersuasive. Nothing is more absard than to suppose, that as soon
as a speaker ascen-ds a pulpit, or riises in a pubEicassembly, he is instantly to lay aside the
voice wvitth which he ex)presses himselt in private, and to assume a new, studied tone, and a
cadence, altogether different -from his natur;al
mnanner. This has vitiated all delivery, a n(I
has given rise to cant antd tedious monotc;.y.
Let every public s )peaker guard against this error. Whethter he speak in private, or in a
great assembly, let him remember that lie still
spelaksl. Let him takiie nature for his guide, and
she will teach him to express his sentiments and
feelings, in such manner, as to make the most
forcible and pleasing inmpression upon the miuds
of htis hearers.
It now remains to treat of gesture, or what
is called action, in public discourse. The best
rule is, attend to the looks and gesture, in
which earnestncss, indignation, compassion, or
any other emotion, discovers itself to most adtoo       PIrOnPJOUNCIATION Olt DfI7rERY.

let these be your model.  A public speaker

MEANS OF IMPROVING 1N ELOQUENCE.
TO those who are anxious to excel in any of
the higher kinds of oratory, nothing is more necessary than to cultivate habits of the several
virtues, and to refine and improve their moral
feelings.  A true orator must possess generous
sentimlents, warm feel'ngs, s.nd a tnind turrned
toward adimiration of those great and high objects which mnen are by nature formed to eaerate.&gt; Connected with manly virtues, he should
possess strong and tender sensibility to all the
injuries. distresses and sorlowvs of' his-fellow
creatures.
Next to moral qualificltions, what is most requisite for an orator. is a fiJnd ot knowledge.

sources than from rhetoric, A pleader must make
himself completely acqutiated with the law;
he must possess all that learning and experience
which can be usefuii for supportiag a cause, or
convincing a judge. A preacher must apply
himself closely to 1the studly of divinity, of
practical religion, of morals, and of human
nature; that he mnay be rich in all topics of instruction and persuasion. He who-wishes to
excel in the supreme council of the nation, or
in any public assembly, should be thoroughly
acquainted with the business that belongs to such
assembly; and should attend with accuracy to
all th fiacts which may be the subject o; question
or deliberation.
Beside the knowledge peculiar to his professioni, a public speaker should be acquainted with
the general circle of polite literature. Poetry
he will finl useful for embellishing his style,
for suggesting lively images orpleasing illusions.
Ilistory may be still more advantageous; as the
knowliedge of facts, of eminent characters, and
of the course of human affairs, finds place on

even in subjects not immediately connected.with
his profession, will expose a public speaker to
many disadvantages, atn 1 give his lrivals who are
better qualified, a decided. superiority.
To every one who wiishes to ex,;el in e!oquence, application and industry cinnot be too

confined by rule; repetitions may often be
requisite; parentheses may sometimes be ornamental; the same thought must often be placed
in different points of view; since the hearers
can catch it only from the mouth of the speaker, and have not the opportunity, as in reading,
of turning back again, and of contemplating
what they do not entirely compreliend. Hence,
the style of many good authors would appear
stiff, affected, and even obscure, if transferred
into popular oration.  How unnatural, for instance,would Lord Shaftesbury's sentences sound
in the mouth of a public speaker? Some kinds
of public discourse, indeed, such as that of the
pulpit, where more accurate preparation and
more studied style are allowable, would adn.it
such a manner better than others, which are
expected to approach nearer to extemporaneous speaking. But still there is generally such
a difference between the composition intended
only to b e read, and one proper to be spoken, as
should caution us against a close and improper
imitation.
The composition of some authors approaches
nearer to the style of speaking than that of
others; and they may, therefore, be imitated
with more safety. In our own language, Swift
and Bolingbroke are of this description. The
former, though correct, preserves the easy and
natural manner of an unaffected speaker. The
style of the latter is more splendid; but still it
is the style of speaking, or rather of declamation.
Frequent exercise, both in composing and
speaking, is a necessary mean of improvement.
That kind of composition is most useful which
S20o   MEANSA OSF IMPlROviN IN ELOQ,TENOW.
is connected with the profession, or sort: of public speaking, to which persons devote thetmselves. This they should ever keep in view,
and gradually inure themselves to it. At the
same time they should be cautious not to allow
themselves to compose negligently on any occasion. He who wishes to write or speak correctly, should in the most trivial kind of composition, inwriting a letter, er even in common
conver;ation, study to express himself with
propriety. By this we do not mean that he is
neve-r to write or speak but in elaborate and
artificial language. This would introduce stiffness and affectation, infinitely worse than the
greatest negligence. But we must observe, that
there is in every thing a proper and betooming
manner r; and, on the contrary, there is also an
awkward performance of the same thing. The
becomling manner is often the most light and
seemingly most careless; but taste and attention
are requisite to seize the just idea of it. That
idea, when acquired, should be kept in view,
and upon it should be formed whatever we write
or speak.
Exercises in speaking have always been recomsended to students; and when under proper
regulation, must be of great use. Tlhose public and promiscuous societies in which numbers
are brought together, who are frequently of
low stations and occulpations; who are connected by no coinmmon bond of uniQn, except a ridiculous rage-for public spealking, and have no
other object in view than to exhibit their supposed talents;' are institutions not only useless but
injurious..  They  are calculated to become
seminaries of licentiousness, petulence, and facNErA'S ciF IMPROVING IN ELOQUEN'CE.  207
tion. Even the allowable meetings into which
stude'its of oratory may form themselves, need
direction in order -to render them useful. ilf
their subjects of discourse be improperly chosen; if they suipport extravagant or indecent
topics; if they indulge themselves in loose and
flimsy declamation; or accustom themselves
without preparation to speak pertly on all sub..jects; they will unavoidably acquire a very
faulty and vicious taste in speaking. It should
therefore be recommended to all those who are
members of such societies, to atteiid to the
choice of their subjects; to take care that they
be useful and manly, either connected with the
course of their studies, or related to morals and
taste, to action and life. They should also be
temperate in the practice of speaking; not
speak too often, nor on subjects of which they
are ignorant; but only when they have proper
materials for a discourse, and have previously
considered and digested the st.ubject. In speak.
ing, they should be cautious always to keep
good sense and persuasion in view, rather thas
a show of eloquence. By these means they will
gradually formr the.mseelves t a manly, correct
and persuasive manner of speaking.
It may now be assked, of what use will the
study of critical and rhetorical  writers be to
those who wish to excel in eloquence? They
certainly ought not to be neD'lected; and yet,
perhaps, very sauch caMnot be expected from
them. It is, hbowever, romr the original ancient
writers that the greatesc advantage may be derived; and it is a disgrace to any one whose

unacquainted  with thetm. In all the ancientSUBLIiITTY IN OCJECTS.
whose duration, added to thie omnipotence of
his power, though they surpass our conceptiolns,

Disorder is also very comnpatible with grar.
0deur; nay, frequently heiglhtens it.-Few things
which are exactly regular rnd methiodi-al, appear sublime. We see the limits on every side;
we feel ourselves confined; there is no rooni
for any considerable exertion of the mind.
Though exact proportion of papts enters often
into the beautiful, it is much disregarded in the
sublime. A great mass of rocks thrown together by the hand of nature with wildness and confusion, strikes the mind with more grandeur,
than if they had been adjusted to each other
with the most accurate symmetry.
There yet remains one class of sublime objects to be mentioned,which may be termed the
-oral or sentimental sublitne, arisin'g from cerlain exertions of the mind; from affections
and actions of our fellowv creatures.  These
wvill be'~oundto be chiefly of thtat class which
comes under the name of magnanimnity or heroism; and they produce an effect very sinilar to whlat is produced by a view of grand
objects in nature, filling the mind with admriration and raising it above itself. Wherever, in some critical and dangerous situation,
we behold a man uncommonly intrepid, and resting solely upon himself; superior to passion
and to fear; animated by some great principle
to conterpt of popular opinion, of selfish interest, of dangers, or of death; we are ther,

rhetorical writers there is indeed one defect;
they are too systematical. They aim at doing
too much; at reducing rhetoric to a perfect
art, which may even supply invention with materials on every sutzect; so that one would
suppose they expected to form an orator by
rule, as they would form a carpenter. But, in
reality, all that can be done is to assist and enlighten taste, and to point out to genius the
course it ought to hold.
Aristotle was the first who took rhetoric out
of the hands of the sophists, and founded it on
reason and solid sense. Some of the profoundest observations which have been made on the
passions and manners of men, are to be found in
his Treatise on Rhetoric; though in this, as in
all his writings, his great conciseness often renders him obscure. The Greek rhetoricians who
succeed him, most of whom are now, lost, improved on his foundation. Two of them still
remain, Demetrius Phalereus, and Dionysius of
Halicarnassus. Both wrote on the construction
of sentences, and deserve to be consulted; partichlarly Dionysius, who is a very accurate and
judicious critic.
To recommend the rhetorical writings of Cicero, is superflaous. Whatever on the subject of
eloquence is suggested by so great an orator,
must be worthy of attention. His most extensive work on this subject, is that de Oratore.
None of his writings are more highly finished
than this treatise. The dialogue is polite; the
characters are well supportedl, and the management of the whole is beautifult and pleasing.
The Orator ad AJl. Bruturm is also a valuable
treatise; and indeed through all Cicero's\,rhetca%,rs'AtusoN OF TU-E ANCIENTS, &amp;C.  O
orical workis are displayed those sublime ideas
of eloquence which are calculated to form a
juist taste, and to inspire that enithutsiasm for the
~art which is high'ly conducive to excellence.
But of all ancient writers on thie subject of

COMPARATIVE MIERIT OF TI-lE ANCIENTS
AND MODEYENS.
A VERY curious, questioni has been agitaIted,
wvith regard to thie compiarative inerit of' the an-cients anid mnoderris.  In France, this dispute
was carriedi on) with great'heat, between Boileau and Madame. Dacier, for the ancients, and
Perrault and La Motte, for the moderns. Eveni
titthis day, men of letters are divided on the
subject.  A few reflectieuis upo'n it mnay be useful.
209otQ      CO'cIPART50ON OF TIE ANCIEnn
To decry the ancient classics is a vain attempt.
Their reputation is established upon too solid a
foundation to be shaken. Imperfections may be
traced in their writings; but to discredit their
works in general, can belong only to peevishness or prejudice.  The approbation of the
public through so many centuries, esta"'lishes a
verdict in their favor, from which there is no
appeal.
In matters of mere reasoning the world mnay
be longin error; and systerit of philosophy
often have a currency for a time, and then die.
But in objects of taste there is no such fallibility; as they depend not on knowledge and science, but upon sentiment and feeling. Now
the universal feeling of mankind must be right  
Homer and Virgil, therefore, must continue to
stand upon the same ground which thley have so
long occupied.
Let us guard, however, against blind veneration for the ancients, and institute a fair comparison between them and Sthe moderns. -If
the ancients had the pre-eminence in genius, yet
the moderns must have some advantage in all
arts which  are  improved by the natural
progress of knowledge.
Hence, in natural plilosophy, attronomy,
chymistry, and other sciences, which rest upon
observations of facts, the moderns have a decided superiority over the ancients. Perhaps,
too, in precise reasoning, philosophers of modern ages are superior to those of ancient times;
as a more extensive literary intercourse has
contributed to sharpen the faculties of men.
The moderns have also the superiority in his.
tory and in political knowledge; owing to theextension of commerce, the disco'very of different countries, the superior facility of intercourse, and the multiplicity of events and revolutions, which have taken place in the world.
In poetry, likewise, some advantages have been
gained, in point of regularity and accuracy. In
dramiatic performances, improvements have
certainly been made upon the ancient models.
The variety of characters is greater; greater
skill has been displayed in the conduct of the
plot; and a happier attention to probability and
decorum. Among the ancients we find higher
conceptions, greater simplicity, and more orig.
inal fancy. Among the moderns, there is more
of art and correctness, but less genius. But
though this remark may, in general, be just,
there are some exceptions from it; Milton and
Shakspeare are inferior to no poets in any age.
Among the ancients, were many circumstances, favyorable to the exertions of genius. They
travelled much in search of learning, and conversed with priests, poets, and philosophers.
They returned home full of discoveries, and
fired by uncommon objects. Their enthusiasm
was greater; and few being stimulated to excel
as authors, their fame was more intense and
flattering.  In modern times good writing is less
prized. We write with less eflort. Printinghas so multiplied books, that astistance is easily
procured. Hence mediocrity of genius prevails. To rise beyond this, and to soar above
the crowd, is given to few.
In epic poetry, Homer and Virgil are still unrivalled; and orators, equal to Demosthenes and
Cicero, we have none. In history, we have no
modern narration so elegant, so picturesque, to

HISTORICAL WRITING.
HISTORY is a record of truth for the instruc.
tion of mankind. \Hence, the great -requisites
in a historian, are impartiality, fidelity and accuracy.
In the conduct of historical detail, the first
object of a historian should be, to give his work
all possible unity. History should not consist of
unconnected Jarts. Its portions should be united by some connecting principle, which will
produce in the mind an impression of something
that is one, whole and entire. Polybius, though
not an elegant writer,is remark able'or this
quality.
A historian should tiace actions and events to
their sources. He should, therefore, be well
acquainted with human nature and politics.
His skill in the former, will enable him to describe the characters of individuals; and his
knowledge of the latter,to account for the revolutions of government, and the operation of
political c_auses on public affairs. WIith regard
to political knowledge, the ancients wvanted
some advantages, which are enjoyed by the
moderns. In ancient times there was less communication among neighboring states; no intercourse by established posts, nor by ambassadors at distant courts. Larger experience, too,e.l 4         llSrTORICAL WvIL'ItN'..of the different modes of government has improved the modern historian, beyond the historian of antiquity.
It is however in the form  of'narrative, and
not by dissertation, that the historian is to irmpart his political knowledge.  Formal discussions expose him to the suspicion of being willing
to accomtmodate his facts to his theory. They
have also an air of pedantry, and evidently. resuilt from want of art. Ior reflections,whether
moral, political, or philosophical, mav be insinuated in the body of a narrative.
Clearness, order, and connection, are primary
virtues in historical narration. These are attained when the historian is complete master of
his subject; can see the whole at one view;
and comprehend the dependance of all its parts.
History being a dignified species of composition,
it should also be conspicuous for gravity.
There should be nothing mean nor vulger in
the style; ne quaintness, no smartness, no affection, no wit. A history should likewise be interesting; and this is the quality which chiefly
distinguishes a writer of genius and eloquence.
To be interesting, a historian must preserve
a medium between rapid recital, and prolix detail. He should know when to be concise, and
when to enlarge. He should make a proper
selection of circumstanees.  These give lite,
body, and coloring to his narration. They
constitute what is termed historical painting.
In all these virtues of narration, particularly
in picturesque description, the ancients eminently excel. Hence, the pleasure of reading
Thucydides, Livy, Sallust, and Tacitus.  In
historical painting there are great varietieisMISTORICAL WRITIYN.           )1:B
Livy and Tacitus paint in very elifferent ways.
The descriptions of Livy are full, plain, and:
natural; those of Tacitus are short and bold.
One embellishment, which the moderns have
laid aside, was employed by the ancients. Taey
put orations into the mouths of celebrated personages. By these they diversified their history, and conveyed both moral and political in.
struction. Thucydides was the first, who adop.
ted this method; and the orations, with which
his history abounds, are valuable remains of an.
tiquity. It is doubtful, however, whether this
embellishment should be allowed to the historian; for they form  a mixture, unnatural to
history, of truth and fiction. The moderns are
more chaste, when on great occasions, the historian delivers in his own persodn, the sentiments and reasonings of opposite parties.
Another splendid embellishment of history
is the delineation of characters.--These are
considered, as exhibitions of fine writing; aud
hence the difficulty of excelling in this prov.
ince. For characters may be too shining and
labored. The accomplished historian avoids
here to dazzle too much. He is solicitou3 to
give the resemblance in a style equally removed from   meanness and affectation,  lie
studies the grandeur of simplicity.
Sourd rorality should always reign in histo.
ry. A historian should ever shoIw himself on
the side of virtue. It iS not, however, his province, to deliver moral instructions in a formal
manner. lie should excite indignation against
the designing and the vicious; and by appeals
to the passions, he will not only improve hi.s
reader, but take away from t(he natural coolness
of histcricai narration,216iW'~~   IRISTORPIC.AL WarriTlG.
In modern times, historical genius has shone
most in Italy.  Acuteness, political sagacity,
and wisdom, a,e all conspicuous in Machiarel,
G;uicciardin, Davila, Bentivoglio, and Father
Paul. In Great Britain, history has been fashionable only a few years. For though Clarendon and Burnet are considerable historians,
they are inferior to Hume5 Robertson, and Gibbon.
The inferior kinds of historical composition,
are annals, memoirs, and lives. Annals are a
collection of facts in chronological order; and
the properties of an annalist are fidelity and,
distinctness. Memoirs are a species of composition, in, which an author pretends not to give
a complete detail of facts, but only to record4
what he himself knew, or was concerned in, or
what illustrates the conduct of some person, or
some transaction, which he ch ooses for his subject. It is not, therefore expected of such a
writer, that he possess the same profound research, and those superior talents, which are
requisite in a historiau. It is chiefly required
of him, that he be sprightly and interesting.
T'lhe French, during two centuries, have poured
foth;a flood of memoirs; the most of which
are little more than agreeable trifles. We must,
holwever, exempt from this censure, the memoirs of the Cardinal de Retz, and' those of the
Duke of S113ly. The former join to a lively
narrative, great kaowledge of hujnan nature.
The- latter  deserve very particular praise.
They approach to the usefulness and dignity of
k,gtimate history.-They are full of virtue
and good sense; and are well calculated to form
7i4t! the heads and hearts of those who. are deSigned -for pWbliti.siness, and high stations j.
the world.
Biography is a very use,,l kind of comvposition; less stately than history, bt peihaps
not less instructive. It affords full o/pp-'it'
of displaying the characters of eminent men,
and of entering into a thorough acquaintance
wi:th them. In this kind of writing, Plutarch
excels,; but his matter is better than his manner;
he has no peculiar beauty nor elegance.  His
judgment and accuracy also are sometimes tax-;ed. But he is a very humane writer, and fond
of displaying great men in the gentle lights of
retirement.
Before we conclude this subject, it is proper
to observe, that of late years, a great imprqvement has been introduced into historical composition. More particular attention than formerly, -has been given to laws, custqms, commerce, religion,literature, and to every thing
thatshows the'spirit and genius of nations. It
is nov- conceived, that a historian ought to illustrate manners, as well as facts and events.Whatever displays the state of mankind in.di'fferent periods; rvhatever illustrates the progress of the human mind, is more useful than details of sieges and battles.

PHILOSOPHICAL WRITING AND DIALOGUE.
OF philosophy the professed design is instruction. With the philosopher, therefore, style,
form, anddress ale inferior objects.  But they
must not be wholly neglected. The same
truths and reasonings, delivered with elegance,
will strike more, than in a dull and dry manner.
Beyond mere perspicuity, the strictest precision and accuracy are required in a philosophical writer; and these qualities may. be possessed without dryness. Philosophical writing admits a polished, neat, and elegant style. It admits the calm figures of speech; but rejects
whatever is florid and tumid.  Plato and Cicero
have left philosophical treatises, composed with
much elegance and beauty. Seneca is too fund
of an affected, brilliant, sparkling manner.
Locke's Treatise os Human Understanding, is a
model of a clear and (listinct philosophical style.
la the writings of Shaftesbury, on the otherhand, philotophy is dressed up with too much
orpament and finery.
Among the ancients philosophical writing of.
ten assumed tke form of dialeogle.  Plato is
eminent for the'beauty of his dialogues. In
richness of imagination, no philosophic writer,
ancient or modern, is equal to him. His only
fault is the excessive fertility of his imagination,
which sometimes obscures his judgment, and
frequently carries him into allegory, fiction, enthusiasm, and the airy regions of mystical theology. Cicero's dialogues are not so spirited and
characteristical as those of Plato. They are,
however, agreeable, and well supported; and
show us conversation, carried on among some
principal persons of ancient Rome,with freedom,
good breeding, and dignity. Of the light and
humorous dialogue, Lucian is a model; and he
has been imitated by several modern writers.
Fontenelle has written dialogues, which are
sprightly and agreeable; but his characters,
whoever his personages be, all become Frenchmen.   The divine dialogues of Dr. Henry
More, amid the academic stiffness of the age,
are often remarkable for character and vivacity. Bishop Berkley's dialogues are abstract,
yet perspicuous.

EPISTOLARY WRITING.
IN  epistolary writing we expect ease and
familiarity; and much of its charm depends on
itsintrodicing us into some acquaintance with
the writer. Its fundamental requisites, are nattire- and simplicity, sprightline's and wit.  The
style of letters, like that of conversafon, should
flow easily. It ought to be neat and correct,
but r!o more. Cicero-'s epistles are the most
valuable collection of letters, extant, in any language. They are composed with purity and
elegarce, but without the least affectation.
Several letters of Lord Bolingbroke and of
Bishop Atterbury are masterly.   In those of
Pope there is generally too much study; and
his letterg to ladies, in particular, are full of affectation. Those of Swift and Arbuthnot, are
written *with ease and simplicity.  Of a familiar coFrespondence, the   most accomplished
model, are the letters of Madame de Sevigne.
They   are easy, varied, lively and beautiful.
The letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montague,
are perhaps more agreeable to the epistolary
style, than any in the English language.

FICTITIOUS HISTORY.
THIS species of composition includes a very
numerous, and in general a very insignificant
class of writings, called romances and novels.
Of these, however, the influence is known to be
great, both on the morals and taste of a nation.
Notwithstanding the bad ends to which this
mode of writing is applied, it might be employed for very useful purposes.  Romances -and
novels describe human life and manners, and
discover the errors into which we are betrayed
by the passions. Wise men in all ages have used fables and fictions as vehicles of knowledge;
and it is an observation of Lord Bacon, that the
common affairs of the world are insufficient to
fill the mind of man. He must create worlds
of his own, and wander in the regions of imagination.
All nations whatsoever have discovered a
love of fiction, and talents for invention. The'
Indians, Persians, and Arabians, abounded in fables and parables. Among the Greeks, we hear
of the Ionian and Milesian tales. During the
dark ages, fiction assumed an unusual form, from
the prevalence of chivalry. Romances arose,
and carried the marvellous to its summit. Their
knights were patterns not enly of the most heroic courage, but of religion, generosity, courtesy and fidelity; and the heroines were no
less distinguished for modesty, delicacy, and

dignity of manners. Of these romances, the
most perfect model is the Orlando Furioso.
But, as magic and enchantment came to be disbelieved and ridliculed, the Chivalerian romances were discontinued, and were succeeded by a
new species of fictitious writing.
Of the second stage of romance writing, the
Cleopatra of Madame Scuderi and the Arcadia
of Sir Philip Sidney, are good: examples. In
these, however, there was still too large a portion of the marvellous; and the books were too
Voluminoeus and tedious. Romance writing appeared, therefore, in a new form, and dwindled
down to the familiar novel. Interestinig situations in real life are the groundwork of novel
writing. Upon this plan, theiFrench have pro.
duced sotne works of considerable    merit.
Such are the Gil Bias of Le Sage, and the Ma.
riauntie of Marivaut.
In this imode of writing the English are inferior to the French; yet in this kind there are
sonae performances which dliscover the strength
of the British genius. No fiction was ever better supportedl, than the adventures of Robinson
Crtisoe.  Fielding's novels are' highly distingiiished for humor and boldness of charfacter.

NATURE OF POETRY.          ITS ORIGIN AND
PROGRESS. VERSIFICATION.
WHAT, it may be asked, is poetry? and how
does it differ from prose?  Many disputes havi
been maintained among critics upon these questions.  The essence of poetry is supposed by
Aristotle, Plato, and others, to consist in fiction.
But this is too limited a description  Many think
the characteristic of poetry lies in Imitation.
But imitation of manners and characters, may
be carried on in prose, as well as in poetry.
Perhaps the best definition is this,'" poetry is
the language of passion, or of enlivened imagination, formed most commonly into regular
numbers."'  As the primary object of a poet is
to please and to move, it is to the imagination
and the passions that he addresses himself: It is
by pleasing and moving, that he aims to inst'uict
and reform.
Poetry is older than prose.  In the beginnindiof society there were occasions, upon which
men met together for feasts and sacrifices, when
music, dancing, and songs were the chief entertainment. The meetings of American tribes
are distinguished by music and songs. in songs,
they celebrate their religious rites and martial
achievements; and in such songs we trace the
beginning of poetic composition.
Man is, by nature, both a poet and musician.
The same impulse which produced a poetic style,
prompted a certain melody or modulation of
sound, suited to the emotions of joy or grief,
love or anger. Music and poetry are united in
song, and mutually assist and exalt each other.
rThe first poets sung their own verses. Hence
the origin of versification, or the arrangement
of words to tune or melody.
Poets and songs are the first objects that
make their appearance in all nations. Apollo,
Orpheus and Amphion were the first tamers of
mankind among the Greeks. The Gothic nations had their scalders, or poets. The Celtic
tribes had their bards. Poems and songs are
among the antiquities of all countries; and, as
the occasions of their being composed are nearly the same, soithey remarkably resemble each
other in style. They comprise the celebration
of gods, and  heroes, and victories.  They
abound in fire and enthusiasm; they are wild,
irregular, and glowing.
During the infancy of poetry, all its different
kinds were mingled in the same composition;
but in the progress of society, poems assumed
their different regular forms. Time separated
into classes the several kinds of poetic composition. The ode, and the elegy, the epic poem,

and the drama, are all reduced to rule, ana exercise the acuteness of criticism.

ENGLISH VERSIFICATION.
NATIONS, whose language and pronunciation were musical, rested their versification
thiefly on the qualities of their syllables; but
mere quantity has very little effect in English
verse. For the difference, made between long
and short syllables, in our manner of prenouncing them, is very inconsiderable.
The only perceptible difference among our
syllables, arises from that strong percussion of
voice, which is termed accent. This accent,
however, does not always make the syllable
longer, but only gives it more force of sound;
and-it iS rather upon a certain order and succession of accented, and unaccented syllables, than
upon their quantity, that the melody of our
verse depends.
In the constitution of our verse, there is another essential circumstance. This is, the cesurat
pause, which falls near the middle of each line.
This pause may fall after the fourth, fifth, sixth,
er seventh syllable; and by this mean, uncormt26Q2OG         ~ENGLISIS VERSIFICATION.
mon variety and richness are added      to English
versification.
Our English verse is of iambic structure, composed of a nearly alternate succession of unaccented and accented syllables. When the pause
falls earliest, that is, after the fourth syllable,
thbe briskest melody is thereby formed. Of this,
the following lines from Pope, are a happy illustration:
On her white breast I a-sparkling cross she wore,
Which Jews might kiss I and infidels adore;
Her lively looks I a sprightly mind disclose,
Quick as her eyes, I and as unfix'd as' those.
Favors to none, I to all she smiles extends,
Oft she rejects, I but never once offends.
When the pause falls after the fifth syllable,
dividing the line into two equal portions, the
melody is sensibly altered.    The verse, losing
the brisk air of the former pause, becomes
more smooth and flowing.
Etertral sunshine i of the spotless mind,
Each prayer accepted, I and each wish resigned.
When the pause    follows the sixth    syllable,
the melody becomes grave. Thee movement of
the verse is more solemn and measured.

The grave cadence becomes still more sensible, when the pause follows the seventh syllable.  This kind of verse, however, seldom       occurs; and its effect is to diversify the melody.
And in the smooth, deseriptive I murmur still,
Long lov'd, ador'd ideas, I all adieu.
Our blank verse is a noble, bold,and disencumbered mode of versification. It is free from
the full close which rhyme forces upon the ear
at the end of every couplet. Hence it is peculiarly suited tosubjects of dignity   and force.QUvEsTIoNs.             227
It is more favorable than rhyme to the sublime,
and highly pathetic. It is the most proper for
an epic poem, and for tragedy. - Rhyme finds
its proper place in the middle regions of poetry;
and blank verse in the highest.
The present'form of our English heroic
rhyme, in couplets, is modern.  The measure
used in the   days of Elizabeth, James, and
Charles I. was the stanza of eight lines. Waller was the first, who introduced couplets; and
Dryden established the usage. Waller smoothed our verse, and Dryden perfected it. The
versification of Pope is peculiar. It is flowing,
smooth, and correct, in the highest degree. He
has totally thrown aside the triplets so commnon
in Drydes.   In ease and variety, Dryden excels
Pope. He frequently makes his couplets run
into one another, with] somewhat of the freedom of blank verse.

PASTORAL PQETRY.
IT was not before men had begun to assem.
ble in gieat cities, and the bustle of courts and
large societies was known, that pastoral poetry
assumed its present form. From the tumult of
a city life, men looked back with comlJacency
t. the innocence of rural retirement. JIn the
court of Ptolemy, Theocritus;wrote the first
pastorals with which we are acquainted; and
in the court of Augustus, Virgil imitated him.
The pastoral is a very agreeable species of
poetry. It lays before us the gay and pleasing
scenes of nature. It recalls objects wvhich are
commonly the delight of our childhood and
youth. It exhibits a life, with which we assor
ciate ideas of innocence, peace, and leisure. It
transports us into Elysian regions. It.presents
many objects favorable to poetry; rivers. and
mouptains, meadows and hills, rocks and trees,
flocks and shepherds void of care.
A pastoral poet is careful to exhibit whatever
is most pleasing in the pastoral state. He paints
its simplicity, tranquillity, innocence, and hap.
piness; but conceals its rudeness and misery.
if his pictures be not those of real life, they
must resemble it. This ip a general idea of
pastoral poetry.  But, to understand it more
perfectly, let us consider, 1. The scenery i 2.
I'he characters i and lastly, the subjects it should
exhibit.
The scene must always be in the country;,and the poet must have a talent for description.
In this respect, Virgil is excelled by Theocritus,
whose descriptions are richer and more picturesque.  lr every pastoral, a rural prospect
should be -drawn, with distinctness. It is notPASTORAL POETRY.
enough to have unmeaning groups of roses and
violets, of birds, breezes, and brooks thrown
together. A good poet gives such a landscape
as a painter might copy.  hiis objects are particularized. The stream, the rock, or the tree,
so stands forth, as to make a figure in the imag.
ination, an, give a pleasing conception, of the
place where we are.
In his allusions to natural objects as well as in
proft;ssed descriptions of the scenery, the poet
must study variety.  He must diversify his face
of nature by presenting us new images.   He
must also suit the scenery to the subject of his
pastoral; and exhibit nature under such forms,
as may correspond with the emotions and sen-timents he describes.  Thus Virgil, when he
gives the lamentation of a despairing lover,
communicates a gloom to the scene.
Tantum inter densas, uimbrosa cacntmina, fagos,
Assdiue venlebat; ibi haee incondita soius
Montibus et sylvis studio jactabat inanij
With regard to the characters in pasto.als it.
is not sufficient, that they be persons residing in
the country. Courtiers and citizens, who resort
thither occasiona ly, are not the characters, expected in pastorals.  We expect to be entertained by shepherds, or persons wholly engaged
in rural occupations. Trhe shepherd must be
plain and unaffected in his manner of thinking.
An amiable simplicity must be the groundwork
of his character; though there is no necessity
for his being dull and insipid. He may have
good sense and even vivacity; tender and delicate feelings. But he must never deal in general reflections, or abstract reasonings; nor in
conceits of gallantry; lor these are consequenres of refinement. i When Aminta in Tasso is

disentangling his mistress's hair from the tree,
to which a savage had bound it; he is made to
say, " Cruel tree, how couldst thou injure that
lovely hair, which did thee so much honor?
Thy rugged trunk was not worthy of so lovely
knots.  What advantage have the servants of
love, if those precious chains are common to
them and to trees?"  Strained sentiments, like
these, suit rot the woods.  The language'of
rural personages is that of plain sense and natural feeling; as in the follovwing beautiful lines
of Virgil:
Sepibus itl nostris parvam te roscida mala
(Daix ego vester eram) vidi cum matre legenrtem;
Alter ab uydecimo turn- me jam ceperat allnus,
Jam tiagiles poteram a terra coitingere ramos,
Ut vidi, ut peril, ut me mains abstuliterror!
The next inquiry is, what are the proper subjects of pastorals?  Forit is not enough, that
the poetgive us shepherds discoursing together.
Every good poem has a subject, that in some
way interests us. In this lies the difficulty of
pastoral wrifing.  The active scenes of country
life are too barren of incidents. The condition of a shepherd has few things in it that
excite curiosity or surprise. Hence of all poems the pastoral is most meagre in subject, and
least diversified in strain.  Yet this defect is
not to be ascribed solely to barrenness of subjects. It is in a great measure the fault of the
poet. For human nature and human passions
are much the same in every situation and rank
of life.  What avariety of objects within the
rural sphere do the passions present! The
struggies and ambition of shepherds; their adventures, their disquiet and felicity; the rivalship of lovers; unexpected successes and disas,PASTORAL POETRY.
ters; are all proper subjects for the pastoral
nluse.
Theocritus and.Virgil are the two great fathers of pastoral writing. For simplicity of sentiment, harmony of numbers, and richness. of
scenery, the former is highly distinguished.
Bat he sometimes descends to ideas that are
gross and mean, and makes his shepherds abusive and immodest. Virgil, on the contrary, preserves the pastoral simplicity without any oftensive rusticity.
Modern writers of pastorals have, in general,
imitated the ancient poets. Sannazarius, however, a Latin poet, in the age of Leo X. attempted a bold innovation, by composing piscatory
eclogues, and changing the scene from woods
to the sea, and the character from shepherds to
fishermen. Buithe attempt was so unhappy
thrat he has no followers, The  toilsome life
of fishermen has nothing agreeable to present
to the imagination. Fishes and marine productions have nothing poetical in them. Of all the
moderns, Gesner,a poet of Switzerland,has been
the most happy in pastoral composition. Many
new ideas are introduced in his Idyls. His
scenery is striking, and his descriptions lively.
He is pathetic, and writes to the heart. Neither the pastorals of Pope, nor of Philips, do
much honor to English poetry. The pastorals
of Pope are barren; their chief merit is the
smoothness of the numbers. Philips attempted
to be more simple and natural, than Pope; but
wanted genius to support the attempt. His
topics, like those of Pope, are beaten; and
instead of being natural or simple, he is flat and
insipid. Shenstone's pastoral ballad is one of
231232                t,UESTIONS.
the most elegant poems of the kind in the English;inguage.
In latter times, pastoral writing has been extended into regular drama; and this is the chief"
improvement the moderns have made in it.
Two piecer of this kind are highly celebrated,
Guarini's  Pastor Fido, and Tasso's Aminta.
Both possess great beauties; but the latter $s
the preferable poem, because less intricate, and
less affected; though not wholly free fronm Italian refirnement.  As a poem, however, it has
great merit.  The poetry is pleasing and gentle, and the Italian language confers-'n it much
of that sofstness, which is suited to the pastoral.
The Gentle Shepherd of Allan Ramaty, is a
pastoral drama, which will bear comparison with
anycomposition of the kind in any langutage..
To this ad-mirable poem it is a disadvantage,
that it is written in the old rustic dialect of Scotland, which must soon be obsolete: and it is a
farther disadvantage, that it is formed so entirely on the rural manner of Scotland, that none,
but a native of that country, can thoroughly understand and relish it. - It is full of natural description, and excels in tenderness of sentiment.
The characters are well drawn,' the incidents
affecting, the scenery and manners lively and
just.

LYRIC POE'TRY.
THE ode is a species of poetry, which has
much dignity, and in which many writers in every age have distinguished themselves. Ode in
Greek is the same with song or hymn; and lyric poetry implies, that the verses are accgmpanied with a lyre or musical instrument. In the
ode, poetry retains its first form and its original
union with music. Sentiments commonly constitute its subject. It recites no action. Its
spirit and the manner of its execution mark its
character.  It admits a bolder and more passionate strain than is allowed in simple recital.
Hence the enuthusiasm that belongs to it.
Hence that neglect of regularity, those digressions, and that disorder, it is supposed to admit.
All odes may be classed under four denominations. 1. Hymns addressed to God, or tomposed on religious subjects. 2. Heroic odes, which
concern the celebration of heroes, and great actions. 3. Moral and philosophical odes, which
refer chiefly to virtue, friendship and humanity.
4. Festive and amorous odes, which are calcqlated merely for amusement and pleasure.
Enthusiasm being consi4ered as the characteristic of the ode, it has often degenerated

into licentiotusness.  This species of writing
has, above all others, been infected by want of
order, method, and connection. T'he poet is
out of sight in a moment. He is so abrupt and
eccentric, so irregular and obscure, that we
cannot follow him. It is not indeed necessary
that the structure ofthb ode be so perfectly regular as an epic poem. But in every composition
there otqght to be a whole; and tois whole,
should consist of connected parts. The transition from thought to thougrht, may be light and,
delicate, but the connection of ideas should be
preserved; the author should think, and not:.
rave.
Pindar, the father of lyric poetry, has led hisi
imitat?rs into enthusiastic wildness. They imitate his disorder, without catching his spirit.
In Horace's odes every thing is correct, harmonious, and happy. His elevation is moderate,not rapturous.  Grace and elegance are his
characteristics.  He supports a moral sentiment
with dignity, touches a gay one with felicity,
and has the art of trifling most agreeably. His
language, too, is most fortunate.
Many Latin poets of later ages have imitated
him. Casimir, a Polish poet of the last century, is of this number; and discovers a considerable- degree of original genius andb poetic fire.
He is, however, far inferior to the RomnaR, in
graceful expression. Buchanan, in some of his
lyric compositions, is very elegant and classical.

DIDACTIC POETRY.
OF didactic poetry, it is the express intention
to convey instruction and knowledge.   It may
be executed in different ways. The poet may
treat some instructive subject in a regullar form;
or without istending a great or regular work, he
may inveigh against particular -vices, or make
some moral observations on human life and:htaracters.
The highest species of didactic poetry is a
regular treatise on some philosophical, grave,or useful subject.  Such are the books of Lucreius de Rerum Natura, the Georgics of Virgil,?ope's Essays on Criticism, Akenside's Pleasures
"of the Imagination, Armstrong on Health, and
235DIDACTIC POETRY.
the Art of Poetry, by Horace, Vida, and Boileau.
In all such works, as instruction is the profes.
sed object, the chief merit consists in sound
thought, just principles, and apt illustrations.
It is necessary, however, that the poet enliven
his lessons by figures, incidents, and poetical
painting.  Virgil, in his Georgics, embellishes
the  most trivial circutnstances in rural life.
When he teaches that the labor of the farmer
rmust begin in tae spring, he expresses himself
thus:
Vere novo gelidus canis curm monlibus humor
Liquitur, et Zephyro pitris se gleba resolvit
Depresso incipiat jam tirnm mihi Taurus aratro
Ingemere, et sulco attritus splendescere vomer.
In all didactic works such method is requisite,
as will clearly exhibit a connected. train of instruction.  With regard to episodes and embellishments, writers of didactic poetry are indulged great liberties--For, in a poetical performance, a continned series of instruction, without
embellishment, soon fatigues.  The digressions
in the Georgics of Virgil, are his principal beauties.  The happiness of a country lite, the fable of Aristeus, and the tale of Orpheus and
Eurydice, cannot be praised too much.
A didactic poet ought also to connect his episodes with his subject.  In this, Virgil is eminent.  Among modern didactic poets, Akenside
and Armstrong, are distinguished.  The former
is rieh and poetical; but the latter m-aintains
greater equality, and more chaste and correct
elsgance.
Of didactic poetry, satires and epistles run
into the most familiar style.  Satire seems to
have been at first a relict of ancient comedy.9IDACTIC POETRY.
thie grossness of' which was corrected by Ennius
and Lucilius. At length, Horace brought it
into its present form. Reformation of manners
is its professed end; and vice and vicious characters are the objects of its censure. There
are three different modes, in which it has been
conducted by the three great and ancient satirists, Horace, Juvenal, and Persius.
The satires of Horace have not much elevatio:i. They exhibit a measured prose. Ease
and grace characterize his manner; and he
glances rather at the follies and weakness of
mankind, than at their vices. He smiles while
he reproves.  le moralizes like a sound philosopher, but with the politeness of a courtier.
Juvenal is more declamatory and serious; and
ha greater strength and fire. Persius has distinguished himself by a noble and sublime mor.
aity.
Poetical epistles, when employed on moral
or -critical subjects, seldom rise into a higher
strain of poetry, than satires.-But in the epistolary form, many other sub jects may be treated; as love, poetry, or elegiac. The ethical
epistles of Pope are a model; and in them he
shows the strength of his genius. Here he had
a full opportunity for displaying his judgment
and wit, his concise and happy expression, together with the harmony of his numbers. His
imitatiovs of Horace are so happy, that it is difficult to say, whether the original or the copy
ought to be most admired.

DESCRIPTIVE POETRY.
IN descriptive poetry, the highest exertions
of genius may be displayed.    In general, indeed, description is introduced as an embellishment, not as the subject of a regular work.  It
is the test of a poet's imagination, and always
distinguishes an original from a second rate genius, A writer of an inferior class, sees nothing
new or peculiar in the object he would paint;DEISCRIPT1VE POETRY,       3
)his conceptions are loose and vague; and his
expressiods feeble and general. A true poet
places an object before our eyes. He gives it
the colouring of life; a painter might copy from
him.
The great art of picturesque descriptiotn lies
in the selection of circumnstances.-These ought
never to be vulgar or common. They should
niark strongly the object. No general description is good; all distinct ideas are formed upon
particulars. There should also be uniformity
in the circumstances selected. In describing a
great object, every circumstance brought forward should tend to aggrandize; and in describing a gay object, all the circumstances should
tend to beautify it. Lastly, the circumstances
in description should be expressed with conciseness and simplicity.
The largest and fullest descriptive performances, in perhaps any language, is Thompson's
Seasons; a work, which possesses very uncommon merit. The style is splendid and strong,
but sometimes harsh and indistinct. He is an
animated and beautiful describer; for he had a
feeling heart, and a warm imagination. He
studied nature with c7re; was enamoured of her
beauties; and had the happy talent of painting
them like a master. To show the power of a
single well chosen sircumstance in heightning a
description, the following passage may be produced from his Summer, where, relating the
effects of heat in the torrid zone, he is led to
take notice of the pestilence that destroyed the
English fleet at Carthagena, under Admiral VTer240              DESCRIPTIVE POETI RY.
-----  You, gallant Vernon, saw
The miserable scele; you, pit)ying saw
To infant weakness sunk the warrior's armt!
Saw the dleep racking pang; the ghastly form;  
The lip pale quivering, and the beamless eye
No more with ardour bright; 3 uu heard the groans
Ofagonizing ships from shore to shore;
Heard nightly plhng'd amid the sullen waves
The frequent corse.--
All the circumstances here selected, tend.to
heighten the dismal scene; but the         last image
is the most striking in the picture.
Of descriptive narration, there are       beautiful
examples,    in  Parnell's   Tale   of   the  Hermit.
The setting forth of the herinit to visit the
world, his meeting a companion, and thb         house
in which they are entertained, of the vain man,
the covetous man, and the good man, are pieces
of highly finished painting. But the richest and
the most remarkable of all the descriptive         po,
ers  in the  English   language, are     the  Allegro
and,the   Penseroso    of  Milton.    They    are  the.
storchouse, whence many succeeding poets have
enriched their descriptions, and are inimitably
fine poems. Take for instance, thle following
lines from the Penseroso:
----  I walk unseen
On the dry, smooth sliaven greels,
To belhold the wandering moon
Riding near her highest noon;
And,oft, as if lier h;ead she bow'td,
Stooping through a fleecy cloud.

Over some wide watered shore
Swinging slow with solemn roar;
Or if the air wvill not permit,

Or the bellman's drowsy charm,
To bless the doors from nightiv harm
Or let my laml at midnight hour

Here are no general expressions; all is picturesque, expressive, and concise. One strong
point of view is exhibited to the reader; and
the impression made, is lively and interesting.
Both Homer and Virgil excel in poetical description. In the second Eneid, the sacking of
Troy, is so particularly described, thatf the reader finds himself in the midst of the scene.
The death of Priam is a master-piece of description. Homer's battles are all wonderful.
Ossian, too, paints in strong colours, and is remarkable for touching the heart. He thus portrays the ruins of Balclutha; " I have seen the
walls of Balclutha; but they were desolate.The fire had resounded within the halls; and
the voice of the people is now heard no more.
The stream of Clutha was removed from its
place by the fall of the walls; the thistle shook
there its lonely head: the moss whistled to the
wind. The fox looked out of the window; the
rank grass waved round his head. Desolate is
the dwelling of Moina; silence is in the house
of her fathers."
Much of the beauty of descriptive poetry
depends upon a proper choice of epithets.
Many poets are often careless in this particular;
hence the multitude of unmeaning and redundantepithets. Hence the "Liquidi Fontes" of
Virgil, and the "Prata Canis Albicant Pruinis"
of Horace. To observe that water is liquid,
and that snowv is white, is little better than mere

THXE POETRY OF THE HEBREWS.
IN treating of tne various kinds of poetry,
that of the scriptures justly deserves a place.
The sacred books present us the most ancient
monuments of poetry now extant, and furnish a
curious subject of criticism. They display the
taste of a remote age and country. They exhibit a singular, but beautifull species of composition; and it must give great pleasure, if weTHlE POETRY OF THE HEBREWSm  w43
find the beauty and dignity of style adequate to
the weight and importance of the matter. Dr.
Lowth's learned treatise on the p -etry of the
Hebrews, ought to be perused by all. It is an
exceedingly valuable work, both for elegance
of style, and justness of criticism. We cannot
do better than to follow the track of this ingenious author.
Among the Hebrews, poetry was,ultivated
from the earliest times. Its general construction is singular and peculiar. It consists in dividing every period into correspondent, for the
most part into equal members, which answer to
each other, both in sense and sound. In the
first member of a period a sentiment is expressed; and in the second, the same sentiment is
amplified; or repeated in different terms, or
sometimes contrasted with its opposite. Thus,
" Sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the
Lord, all the earth. Sing unto the Lord, and
bless his name; show forth his salvation from
day to day. Declare his glory among the heathen; his wonders among all people."
\This form of poetical composition is deduced
from the manner in whicb the Hebrews sling
their sacred hymns. These were accompanied
with music, and performed by bands of sirgers
and musicians, who alternately answered each
other.-One band began the hymn thus; " The
Lord reigneth, let earth rejoice;" and the chorus or semi-chorus, took up the corresponding
versicle; " Let the multitudes of the isles be
glad thereof."
But, independent of its peculiar mode of construction, the sacred poetry is distinguished by
the highest beauties of strong, concise, bold, and.244      TrE POETRY O' P  TrE BEBREWS.
figurative expression. Conciseness and strength
are two of its most remarkable characters. The
sentences are always short. The same thought
is never dwelt upon long. Hence the sublimity
of the HIebrew poetry; and all writers, who
attempt the sublime, might profit much by imitating in this respect, the style of the Old Testam.ent. No writings abound se much in bold
and animated figures, as the sacred books. MIetaphors, comparisons, allegories, and personifications, are particularly frequent. But, to relish these figures justly, we must transport ourselves into Judea, and attend to particular circumstances in it. Through all the region, little or no rain falls in the summer months.
Hence, to represent distress, frequent allusions
are made to a dry and thirsty land where no water is; and hence to describe a change from
distress to prosperity, their metaphors are founded on the falling of showers, and the bursting
out of springs in a desert.  Thus, in Isaiah,
" The wilderness and the solitary place shall
be glad, and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rese. For in the wilderness shall
waters break out, and streams in the desert; and
the parched ground shall become a pool; and
the thirsty land springs of water; in the habitation of dragons there shall be grass, with rushes and reeds."
Comparisons, employed by the sacred poets,
are generally short, totching only one point of
resemblance.  Such is the following:  "'He
that ruleth over men, must be just, ruling in the
fear of God; and he shall be as the light of the
morning,' when the sun riseth: even a morningTHE POETRY OF THE HEBREWS.
without clouds; as the tender grass, springing
out of the earth by clear -shining, after rain."
Allegory is likewise frequently employed in
the sacred books; and a fine instance of this occurs iR the lxxxth Psalm, wherein the people of
Israel age compared to a vine. Of parables,
the prophetical writings are full; and, if to us
they sometimes appear obscure, we should remember, that in early times it was uninversally
the custom among all eastern nations, to convey
sacred truths under mysterious figures.
The figure, however, which elevates beyond
all others, the poetical style of the scriptures,
is personification. The personifications of the
inspired writers exeeed, in force and magnificence, those of all other poets. This is more
particularly true, when any appearance or operation of the Almighty is concerned. "Before
himn went the pestilence. The waters saw thee,
O God, and were afraid. The mountains saw
thee, and they trembled. The overflowings of
the waters passed by; the deep uttered his
voice, and lifted up his hands on high." The
poetry of the scriptures is very different from
modern poetry.' It is the burst of inspiration.
tBold sublimity, not correct elegance, is its character.
The several kinds of poetry, found in scripture,are chiefly the didacticselegiac,pastoral and
lyric. The. book of Proverbs is the principal
instance of the didactic species of poetry. Of
elegiac poetry, the lamentation of David over
Jonathan, is a very beautiful instance. Of pastoral poetry, the Song of Solomon is a high exemplification; and of lyric poetry, the Old TesVI'
245246               QUESTrONS.
tament is full. The whole book of Psalms is a
collection of sacred odes.
Amongthe composers of the sacred books,
there is an evident diversity of style. Of the
sacred poets, the most eminrnt are the author
of the book of Job, David, and Isaiah. In the
compositions of David there is a great variety
of manner. In the soft and tender he excels;
and in his Psalms are many lofty passages. But
in strength of description he yields to Job; in
sublimity, to Isaiah. Without exception, Isaiah
is the most sublime of all poets. Dr. Lowth
compares Isaiah to Homer, Jeremiah to Simoni.
des; and Ezekiel to Eschylus. Among the minor prophets, Hosea, Joel, Micah, Habakkuk,
and especially Nahum, are distinguished for poetical spirit. In the prophecies of Daniel and
Jonah, there is no poetry.
The book of Job is extremely ancient; the
-author uncertain; and it is remarkable, that it
has no connection with the affairs or manners of
the Hebrews. It is the most descriptive of all'the sacred poems. A peculiar glow of fancy
and strength of description, characterize the
author; and no writer abounds so much in metaphors.  He renders visible, whatever he
treats. The scene is laid in the land of Uz, or:dumea, which is a part of Arabia.; and the iaagery employed, differs from that which is peculiarto the Hebrews.

EPIC POETRY,'OF all poetical works, the epic poem is the
most dignified. To contrive a story which is
entertaining, important and instructive; to enrich it with happy incidents; to enliven it by a
variety of characters and descriptions; and to
maintain a uniform propriety of sentiment, and
-a due elevation of style, are the highest efforts
of poetical genius.
An epic poem is the recital of some illustrious enterprise in a poetical form.  Epic poetry
is of a moralnature, and tends to the promo.
tion of virtue. With this view, it acts by exten-ding our ideas of perfection, and exciting admiration. Now this is accomplished only by prop-er representations of heroic deeds and virtuous
-characters. Valor, truth, justice, fidelity, friendship, piety, and magnanimity, are objects, which
the epic muse presents to our minds in the mosg
splendid and honorable colors.
Epic composition is distinguished from history
by its poetical form, and its liberty of fiction.
It is a more calm composition than tragedy. It
requires a grave, equal, and supported dignity.
On some occasions it demands the pathetic:and
the violent; and it embraces a greater vcmpqas

as, if presented to our sig!ti, if exhibited to us
in reality, would excite ideas of that eleyata
ing, that awflhi and magnificentkind, which we
call sublime; the de~ruiption, however finely
drhwn, is not entitled to be placed under this
class.  This ~xciudes all objects, whih' are
merely beautiful, gay, or elegant. Besides, the
object must not only in itseif t-e siblkne, but it
must be placed bdfore na in such a light, as is
best dalculated to give us a clear and full impression of it; it must be described wilth

the poet oe' orator has of the object, wlhich he
exhibits'; and upon his, being d&amp;eply affected
and animatedby the suiblime idea, which he
would convey. If his own feelii:g be languid,
he can neve-r inspire his reader with any strong
emotion. Instances, wh-icha on this subject, are
extremely necessary, will clearly show the importance of allt these requisites.
It is cIiiefly among ancient authors, that we
are to look for the most striking instances of
the sxblime. The early ages of the world, and
the uiicttivated state o sacieiy, were peculiar.248               EPri POsTRY.
of time and action, than dramatic writing admits.
The action or subject of an epic poem, must
have three properties. It must be one; it must
be great; it must be interesting. One action or
enterprise must constitute its subject. Aristotle insists on unity, as essential to epic poetry;
because  independent facts never affect so
deeply, as a tale that is one and connected.
Virgil has chosen for his subject the establishment of AEneas in Italy; and the anger of Achilles, with its consequences, is the subject of the
Iliad.
It is not, howevet, to be understood, that epic
unity exc.ludes all episodes. On the contrary,
critics consider them as great ornaments of epic
poetry. They diversify the subject, and relieve
the reader by shifting the scene. -Thus Hector's
visit to Andromache in the lliad, and Erminia's
adventure with the shepherd, in the seventh
book of the Jerusalem, afford us a well ju(iged
and pleasing retreat from camps and battles.
Secondly, the subject of an epic poem must
be so great and splendid, as to fix attention, and
to justify the magnificent apparatus the poet bestows on it. The subject should also be of ancient date.  Both Lucan and Voltaire have
transgressed this rule. By confining himself
too strictty to historical truth, the former does
not please; and the latter has itnproperly mingled well known events with fictitious. Hence
they exhibit not that greatness which the epic
reqiiJres.
The third requisite in an epic subject is, that
it be interesting.  This depends in a great
measure upon the choice of it. But it depends
much more upon the skilful management of thepoet. He must so frame his plan, as to comrn
prehend many affecting incidents. He mnust
sometimes dazzle with valiant achievement;
sometimes he must be awful and august; often
tender and pathetic; and he must sometimes
give us gentle and pleasing scenes of love, friend.
ship, and affection.
To render the subject interesting, much also
depends upon the dangers and obstacles which
must be encountered. It is by the management
of these, that the poet must rouse attention, and
hold his reader in suspense and ag-itation.
It is generally supposed by ci-itics, that an epic poem should conclude successfully; as an unhappy conclusion depresses the mind. Indeed,
it is on the prosperous side, that epic poets gen.
erally conclude. But two authors of great name,
Milton and Lucan, hold the contrary course.
The one concludes with the subversion of Roman liberty; and the other with the expulsion
of man from Paradise.
No precise boundaries can be fixed for the duration of the epic action. The action of the
Iliad lasts, according to Bossu, only forty seven
days. The action'of the Odyssey extends to
eight years and a half; and that of the AEneid
includes about six years.
The personages in an epic poem, should be
proper and well supported. They should display the features of human nature; and may
admit different degrees of virtue, and even
vice; though the principal characters should be
such as will raise admiration and love. Poetic
characters are of two sorts, general and particular. General characters, are such, as are wise,
brave, and virtuous, without any further distiac2,49
EPIC POETRYs/~50               EPIC POPTR'.
tian. Particular characters express the, species
of bravery, of wisdom, and of virtue, tor which
any one is remarkable. - In this discrimination
of characters, Homer excels. Tasso approaches the nearest to him in this respect; and Virgil is the most deficient.
Among epic poets it is the practice to select
some personage as the hero of the tale. This
renders the unity of the subject more perfect,
and contributes highly to the interest and perfection of this species of writing. It has beer
asked, who then is the hero of Paradise Lost?
The devil, say some critics, who affect to be
pleasant against Milton. But they mistake his
intention, by supposing, that whoever is trium.
phant in the close, must be the hero of the po-.
em. For Adam is Milton's hero; that is, the
capital and most interesting figure in his poem.
In epic poetry, there are besides human characters, gods, and supernatural beings. This
forms what is called the machinery of epic poetry; and the French suppose this essential to
the nature of an epic poem. They hold, that
in every epic composition, the main action is
necessarily carried on by the intervention of
gods, But there seems to be no solid reason for
their opinion.-Lucan has no gods, nor supernatural agents. The author of Leonidas also
has no machinery.
But though machinery is not absolotely necessary to the epic plan, it ought not to be totally
excluded from it., The marvellous has a great
charm for most readers. It leads to sublime
description, and fills the imagination. At the
same time it becomes a poet to be temperate in
the use of supernatural machinery; and so toEPIC POETRY.              25b
employ the religious faith or superstition of his
country, as to- give an air of probability to
events, most contrary to the common course of
nature.
With regard to the allegorical personages,
fame, discord, love, and the like, they form
the worst kind of machinery. In description
they may sometimes be allowed; but they
should never bear any part in the action of the
poem. As they are only mere names of genera, ideas, they ought not to be considered as
persons; and cannot mingle with human actors,
without an intolerable confusion of shadows
with realities.
In the narration of the poet, it is of little consequence, whether he relate the whole story in his
own character, or introduce one of his personages to relate a part of the action that passed befoere the poem  opens.  Homer follows one
method in his Iliad, and the other in his Odyssey.
It is to be observed, however, that if the narrative be given by any of the actors, it gives the
poet greater liberty of spreading out such parts
of the subject, as he inclines to dwell upon in
person, and of comprising the rest within a
short recital. When the subject.   of great extent, and comprehends the transactions of several years, as in the Odyssey and.Eneid, this
method seems preferable. But when the subject is of smaller compass and shorter duralion,
as in the Iliad and Jerusalem, the poet may,
vithout disadvantage, relate the whole in bii4
own person.

position requires more strength, dignity, and
fire,than an epic poem. It is the region in
which we look for every thing sublime in description, tender in sentiment, and bold or lively
in expression.'The ornaments of epic poetry,
are grave and chaste. Nothing loose, ludicrous,
or affected, finds place there.  All the objects
it presents, ought to be great, tender, or pleasing.  Descriptions of disgusting or shocking
objects.are to.be avoided; hence the fable of
the Harpies in the lEie,id, and the allegory of
Sin and Death, in Paradise Lost, should have
been omitted.

HOMER'S ILIAD AND ODYSSEY.
THE father of epic poetry is Homer; and
in order to relish him, we must divest ourselves
of modern ideas of dignity and refinement, and
transport our imagination almost three thousand
years back' in the history of mankind. The
reader is to expect a picture ot the ancient
world. The two great characters of Nomer's
poetry, are fire and simplicity.  But, to have a
clear idea of his merit, let us consider the [Iiad under the three heads of the subject or action, the characters, and the narration.
The subject of the iliad is happily chosen.
For no subject could be more splendid than the
Trojan war. A great confederacy of the Grecian states, and ten years siege otf'lroy, must
have spread far abroad the renown of many
military exploits, and given an extensive interest to the heroes, who were concerned in them.
Upon these traditions, Homer grounded his poem; and, as he lived two or three centuries after the Trojan war, he had full liberty to i9termingle fable with history. He chose not, however, the whole Trojan war for his subject; but
with great judgment,selected'the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon, which includes
the mnost interestipg period of the war. He has
thus given greater unity to his poem. lie has
XAwii4    IIOXIER'S I;IAD AnD 6bYSsr.gained one hero, or principal character, that ias
Achilles; and shown the pernicious effects of
discsrd among confederated princes.
The praise of high invention has in every age
been justly given to Homer, His incidents,
speeches, characters, divine and human; his
battles, his little history pieces of the lpersons
slain, discover a boundless invention. Nor is
his judgment less worthy of praise. His story
i,s conducted with great art. He rises upon us
gradually. His heroes are introduced with exquisite skill to our acquaintance. The distress
thickens, as the poem advances; every thing
serves to aggrandize Achilles, and to make him
the capital figure.
lu characters, HIomer is without a rival. He
abounds in dialogtie and conversation, and, this
yroduces a spirited exhibition of his personages.
This dramatic method, however, though more
natural, expressive, and animnated, is less grave
and majestic, than narrative.  Some of Homer's
speeches are uaseasonable, and others trifling.
With the Greek vivacity, be has also some of
the Greek loquacity.
Iu no character, perhaps, does he display
greater art, than in that of Helen. Notwithstanding her frailty and crimes, he contrives to
make her an interesting object. The admiration, with which the old generals behold her,
when she is coming toward them; her veiling
herself.a;d shedding tears in the presence of
Priam; her grief at the sight of Metelaus; her
ypbraiding of Paris for his cowardice, and her
returning  fondness for him, are   exquisite,s,rokes, and worthy of a great master.
Homer has been accused of making Achillcs'i".MER' ILIAD AND ODYSSEY.
too brutal a character; and critics seem to have
adopted this censure firoml two lines of Horace;
Impiger, iraceundus, inexorabilis, acer,
Jura negat sibi nata; nihil nonl arrogat armis.
It appears that Horace went beyond the truth.
Achilles is passionate; but he is net a contemner of law. He has reason on his side; for
though he discovers too mtuch heat, it must be
allowed, that he had been notoriously wronged.
Beside bravery and contempt ot death, he has
the qualities of openness and sincerity.  He
loves his subjects, and respects the gods.
He is warm in his friendships; and thronighout, he is high spirited, gallant, and honourable.
Homer's gods make a great figure; but his
machinery was not his own invention. He followed the traditions of his country.
But, though his machiaery is often lofty tnd
magnificent, yet his gods are often deficient in
dignity. Trhey have all the human passions;
they drink, and feast, and are vulnerable, like
men. While, however, he at times degrades
his divinities, he knows how to make them appear with most awful majesty. Japiter, for the
most part, is introduced with great dignity; and
several of tbe most sublime conceptions in the
Iliad are founded on the appearances of Neptune, Minerva, and Apollo.
The style of Homer is easy, natural, and
highly animated. Of all the great poets, he is
the most simple in his stjle and resembles most
the style of the poetlcal parts of the Old Testament. Pope5s translation of hirn affords no
idea of his manner. His versification,' however, is allowed to be uncommnnly melodiouis, and
2551  ~OJIER S ILIAD AND QDYSSEY.
to carry beyond ttiat of any poet, resemblance
of sound to sense.
In narration, IHomer is always concise and
descriptive. He paints his objects in a manner
to our sight. His battles are singularly admirable. We see them in all their hurry, terror,
and confusion.  In similies no poet abounds
so much. His comparisons, however, taken i4i
general, are rot his greatest beauties; they
come upon us in too quick succession; and often
disturb his narration or description. His lions,
bulls, eagles, and herds of sheep, recur too frequently.
The criticism of Longinus upon the Odyssey,
is not )vilhout foundation; that in this poem Homer may be likened to the setting sun, whose
grandeur remains without the heat of his meridian beams. it wants the vigor and sublimity of
the Iliad; yet possesses so. many beauties, as to
be justly entitled to high praise. It is a very
amusing poem, and has much greater variety
than the Iliad. It contains many interesting
stories and pleasin,g pictures of ancient manners. Instead of the ferocity which pervades
the Iliad, it presents us most amiable images of
humanity and hospitality. It entertains us with
many a wonderful adventure, and many a landscape of nature; and instructs us by a rich vein
of morality and virtue, running through every
part of the poem.
There are some defects, however, in the
Odyssey. Many of its scenes fall below the majesty of an epicpoerm.  The last twelve books
are, in many places, languid and tedious; and
perhaps, the poet is rot happy in the discovery
of Ulysses to Penelope.  She is too cautiousTHE NEITD OF VIRGIL.

TIHE ENEID OF VIRGIL.
THE distinguishing excellencies of the Eneid
are elegance and tenderness. Virgil is less animated and less sublime than Homer; but lie
has fewer negligences, greater variety, amd
more dignity. The AXneid has all the correctness and improvements of the Augustan age.
We meet no contention of heroes about a female
slave; no violent scolding, nor abusive language; but the poem    opens with the. utmost
magnificence.
The subject of the ~neid, which is the establishment of Agueas in Italy, is extremely happy.
Nothing could be more'interesting to the Romans, than Virgil's deriving their origin from
so famous a hero as AEneas.  The object was.plendid}itself; it gave the poet a theme, taken.X2

ly favorable to the emotions of sublimity.
The genius of men was then very prone to ad4miration and astonishment. Mieting conrtinually new and strange objects, their imagination
was kept glowing, and their passions were oftena
raised to the utmost. They thought atld expressed themselves boldlly without restraint.
In the progress of society tihe genius and pan'ners of men have undergone a change more
favorable to accuracy, than to strength or sublimity.
Of all writings, ancient or m6dern, thle Sacred Sciptidres afford the most striking instance
of the sublime. In them the descriptions of the
Supreme Being are wonderfilly noble', botih
from  the grandeur of the object, and the manner of representing it. What an assemblage
of awfutil and sublime ideas'is'presenited to us in
that passage of the eighteenth Psalm, where ans
appearance of the Almighty is described''I
Imy distress I calledtl upon the Loid;. he heard
my voice out of his temple, and my cry came

He made darkness-his secet place; 9 his pavilion round about him were darli waters and thick

darkness and terror are here applied with propriety and success for heightening the sublime.

from the traditionary history of his country; it
allowed him to adopt Homer's mythology; and
afforded him frequent opportunities of glancing
at all the future great exploits of the Romans,
and of describing Italy in its ancient and fabuions state.
Unity of action is perfectly preserved in thte
Anuied. The settlements of 1Eneas in Italy by
order of the gods, is constantly lkept in view.
T1he episodes are properly linked to the main
subject; and the nodus Dr intrigue of the poem
is happily formed. The wrath of Juno, who
opposes aEneas, gives rise to all his difficulties,
and connects the human with the essential operations, through the whole poem.
Great art and judgment are displayed in the
AEneid; but even Virgil is not without his faults.
One is, that he has so few marked characters.
Achates, Cloanthes, Gyas, and other Trojan heroes, who accompanicd Aneas into Italy, are
ulndistinguished figures. Erven Aneas himself
is not a very interesting hero. He is described,
indeed, as pious and brave; but his character is
not marked by those strokes that touch the
heart. The character of Dido is the best supported in the whole ineid.' 11er warmnth of
passion, keenness of resentment, and violence
of character, exhibit a more animated figure
thanx any other Virgil has drawn.
The management of' th-e subject, also, is in
some respects exceptionable.  The six last
books received not the finishing hand of the au,
thor; and, for this reason, he ordered this tpoem
to be commritted to the flames. The wars with
the Latins are in dignity inferior to the more interesting objects previ4uslty presented to 1us;THE.E:NIED OF VYRGIL.   259
ard the reader is tempted to take part with Turnus against ZEneas.
The principal excellency of Virgil, and what
he possesses beyond all poets, is tenderness.
His soul was full of sensibility. He felt himself
all the affecting circumstances in the scenes he
describes; and knew how, by a single stroke, to
reach the heart. In an epic poem, this merit is
next to sublimity.  The second book. of the
IAneid, is one of the greatest master pieces ever
executed. The death of old Priam, and the
family pieces of Aneas, Anchises, and Creusa,
are as tender as can be conceived. In the

Dido are admirable. The interview of Agneas
with Andromache and Helenus, in the third
book; the episodes of Pallas and Evander, ot
Nisus and Euryalus, of Lausus and Mezentius,
are all striking instances of the power of raising
the tender emotions. The best and most finished books are the first, second, fourth, sixth,

Virgil's battles are, in fire and sublimity, far

LUCAN'S PHARSALIA.
LUCAN is inferior to Homer and Virgil; yet
he deserves attention. There is little invention in his Pharsalia; and it is conducted in tooQ
historical a manner to be strictly epic. It may
be arranged, however, in the epic class, as it
treats of great and heroic adventdres. The
subject of the Pliarsalia, has all the epic dignity and grandeur; and it possesses unity of' object, viz. the trilimph of C2sar over Roman liberty.
But. tho,gh the subhjct of Lucan is coafessedly heroic, it has twvo defects.  Civil wars present objects too shocking for epic poetry, andIXTCAN S PHARSALIA, 2.6
furnish odious anti disgusting views of human
nature. But Lucan's genius seems to delight
in savage scenes,
The other defect of Lucan's subject is, that
it was too near the time in Whvich he lived.
This deprived him of the assistance of fiction
and machinery; and tlereby rendered his work
less splendid and amusing. The facts, on which
he founds his poem, were too well known, and
too recent, to admit fables and the interposition
of gods.           /
The characters of Lucan are drawn with
spirit and force. But, though Pompey is his hero, he has not made him very interesting. He
marks not Pompey by any high distinction,
either for magnanimity or valor.  He is always
surpassed by Caesar. Cato is Lucan's favorite
character; and, whenever he introduces him,
he rises above hirmself.
In managiDg his story, Lucan confines himself too much to chronologiclal order.  This
breaks the thread of his narration, and hurries
him from place to place. He is also too digressive; frequently quitting his subject, to give us
some geographical description, or philosophical
disquisition.
There are several poetical and spirited descriptions in the Pharsalia; but the strength of
this poet does not lie either in narration or des.
cription. His narration is often dry and harsh;
his descriptions are often overwrought, and employed on disagreeable objects. His chief merit consists in his sentiments; which are noble,
striking, glowing, and ardent. He is the most
philosophical, and the most patriotic poet of antiquity. He was a stoic; and the spirit of that262            TAS$*'5 JERRUSALEM.
philosophy breathes through his poem. He is
elevated and bold; and abounds in well timed
exclamations and apostrophes.
As his vivacity and fire are great, he is apt to
be carried away by them. His great defect is
want of moderation. HEe knows not where to
stop. When he would aggrandize his objects,
he becomes tumid and unnatural.    There is
much bombast in his poem. His taste is marked with the corruption of his age; and, instead,
of poetry, he often exhibits declamation.
Os the whole, however, he is an author of
lively and original genius. His high sentiments,
and his fire, serve to atone for many of his defects.  His genius had strength, but no tenderness nor amenity.  Compared with Virgil, he
has more fire and sublimer sentimentes; hut iR
every thing else, falls infinitely below him, particularly in purity, elegance, and tenderness.
Statius, and Silius Italicus, though poets of
the epic class, are too inconsiderable for particular criticism.

TASSO'S JERUSALEM.
JERUSALEM DELIVERED, is a strictly regular epic
poem, and abounds with beauties. The subjectTASSO'S JERUSALEM.
is the recovery of Jerusalem from infidels, by
the united powers of Christendom. The enterprise was splendid, venerable, and heroic;
and an interesting contrast is exhibited between
the Christians and Saracens. Religion renders
the subject august, and opens a natural field for
machinery and sublime description. The action, too, lies in a country, and in a period of
time, sufficiently remote to admit an intermixture of fable with history.
Rich invention is a capital quality in Tasso.
He is full of events, finely diversified. He
never fatigues his reader by mere war and fighting. He frequently shifts the scene; and from
camps and battles, transports us to mere pleas.
ing objects. Sometimes the solemnities of re.
ligion; sometimes the intrigues of love  at
other times the adventures of a journey, or the
incidents of pastoral life, relieve and entertain
the reader. The work, at the same time, is
artfully connected; and, in the midst of variety,
there is perfect unity of plan.
Many characters enliven the poem; artd these
distinctly marked and well supported. Godfrey,
the leader of the enterprise, is prudent, moderate,and brave; Tancred, amorous, generous,
and gallant. Rinaldo, who is properly the hero
of the poem, is passionate and resentful, but full
of zeal, honor, and heroism. Solyman is high
minded; Erminia tender; Armida, artful and
violent, and Clorinda, masculine. In drawing
characters, Tasso is superior to Virgil, and
yields to no poet but Homer.
He abounds- in machinery. When celestial
beiing interpose, his machinery is noble. But
devils, enchanters, and conjurers, act too great
26'.3a part throughout his poem. In general, the
marvellous is carried to extravagance. The poet was too great an admirer of the romantic
spirit of knight errantry.
In describing magnificent objects, his style is
firm and majestic. In gav and pleasing description, it is soft and insinuating.  Erminia's pastoral retreat in the seventh book, and the arts
anld beauty of Armida in the fourth book, are
exquisitely beautiful. His battles are animated,
and properly varied by incidents. It is rather
b)y actions, characters, and descriptions, that he
interests us, than by the sentimental part of his
work. He is far inferior to Virgil in tenderness; and, when he aims at being sentimental
and pathetic, he is apt to become artificiaL
It has often been objected to Tasso, that he
abounds in point and conceit; but this censure
has been carried too far. For, i'a his general
character, he is masculine and strong. The
humor of decrying him, passed from the French
critics to those of England. But their strictures are founded either in ignorance or prejudice. F6r the Jerusalem is, in my opinion, the
third regular epic poem in the world; and stands
next to theilliad and A'ineid. In simplicity and
fire, Tasso is inferior to Homer; in tenderness
to Virgil; in sublimity to Milton; but for fertility of invention, variety of iincidents, expression of characters, richness of description, and
beauty of style, no poet, except the three just
named, can be compared to him.

in return to this prayer Venus appears, and (liscovering the Atorm to be the work of Bacchuls,
complains to Jupiter, and procures thle winds to

towards the end of his work, the poet offers an
awkward apology for his mythology; making
the goddess Thetis inform Vasco, that she and
the other heathen divinities are no more than
names to describe the operations of Providence.
in the Lusiad, however, there is some fine
machinery of a different kind. The appearance
of the genius of the river Ganges, in a dream
to Emanual, king of Portugal, inviting hirn to
discover his secret springs, and acquainting hinm
that he was the monarch, destined to enjoy the
treasures of the East, is a happy idea. Butt in
the fifth canto, the poet displays his noblest conception of this sort, where Vasco recounts to the
king of M.alinda, all the wonders of his voyage.
He tells hinm, that when the fleet arrived at the
Cape of Good Hope, which had never been
doubled before, by a navigator, there appeared
to them suddenly a huge phantom, rising out of
the sea in the midst of tempest and thunder,
with a head that reachedl the clouds, and a countenance that filled them with terror. This was
the genius of that hitherto unknown ocean; and
he menaced them in a voice of thunder for invading those unknown seas; fortelling the calamities that were to befall them, if they should
proceed; ind then with a mighty noise disappeared. This is a very solemin and strikin.g
piece of machinery; and shows that Canmoens
was a poet of a bold and lofty imagination.ThE' TnLEMACIIUS OF FErNELON.  267

THE TELEMACIIUS OF FENELOCN.
IT would be unpardonable in a review of epic
posts to forget the amiable Fenelon. HEis work,
though in prose, is a poem; and the plan in
general is well contrived, having epic grandeur
and unity of action. He employs the ancient
mythology; and excels in the application of it.
There is great richness as well as beauty in his
descriptions.  To soft and calm scenes, his genius is more peculiarly suited; such as the incidents ef pastoral life, the pleasures of virtue,
or a country flourishing in peace.
His first books are eminently excellent. The
adventures of Calypso are the chief beauty of
his work. Vivacity and interest join in the narration.  In the books which follow, there is
less happiness in the execution, and an apparent
languor.  The author, in warlike adventures, is
most unfortunate.
Some critics have refused to rankl this work
among epic poems. Their objection arises from
the minute details it exhibits of virtuous policy,
and from the discourses of Mentor, which recur
too frequently, and too much inl the strain of
common place morality. To these peculiarities, however) the author was led by the design
with which he wrote, that of forming a youngSOTBILIMITY 1N WRITIN-G.
C)there wis light," belongs to the tirue sublime;
and its sublimity arises from the strong ooncenption, it conveys, of an effort of power producing
its effect with the utmost speed and facility.
A similar thought is magnificently expanded in
the following passage of)saiah; Chap. xxiv. 24,
27, 28. "Thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer,
and he, that formed thee from the woxmb; I am
the Lord, that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth

Homer has in all ages been universallv ad.

much of his grandeur to that native and unaf

TFIE HENtRIADE OF VOLTAIRE.
THE Henriadle is, without doubt, a regular
epic poem. In several places of this work,
Voltaire discovers that boldness of conception,
that vivacity and liveliness of expression, by
which he is so much distinguished. Several
of his comparisons are new and happy. But
tile Henriade is not his master-piece. In the
tragic line he has certainly been more successful, than in the epic. French versification is illy
suited to epic poetry. It is not only fettered
by rhyme, but wants elevation.  Hence, not
only feebleness, but-sonmetimes prosaic flatness in the style. The poem consequently languishes, and the reader is not animated by that
spirit which is inspired by a sublime composition of the epic kiind.
The triumph of Henry IV. over the arns of
the League, is the subject of the Henriade. The
action of the poem properly includes only the
siege of Paris. It is an action perfectly epic;
and conlducted with due regard to unity, and to
the rules of critics. But it has great defects.
it is founded on civil wars; and presents to the
mind those odious objects, massacres and assassinations. It is also of too recent date, and too
manch within the bounds of well known history.
The author has farther erred by mixing fiction'
with truth.  The poem, for instance, opens
with a voyage of Henry's to England, and an interview between bim and Queen Elizabeth;
though Henry never saw England, nor ever
conversed with Elizabeth. In subjects of such
notoriety, a fiction of this kiird shocks every intelligent reader.
A great deal of machinery is employed by
Y2
269Voltaire, for the pur,pose of embellishing his
poem.   But it is of the worst kind, that of allegorical bentgs. Discord, cunning, and love, appear as personages, aud mix w,'ith human actors.
This is contrary to all rational criticism.--
Ghosts, angels and devils, have a popular existence; but every one knows that allegorical
beings are no more than representatio:s of
human passions and dispositio. s; and owught not
to have place, as actors, iii a poem  which relates to human transactions.
In justice, however, it must be observed, that
the machinery of St. Louis possesses real dignity,
The prospect of the invisible world, which St,
Louis gives to Henry in a dream, is the finest
passage in the Henriade.  Deathlbringing the
souls of the departed in succesion before God,
and the place of the destinies opened to Henry,
are striking and magnificent objects.
Though some of Voltaire's episodes are
properly extended, his narration is too genieral.
The events are suiperficially related. and too
murch crowded.  The strain of sentiment, however, which pervades the Henriade is high and
noble.

MILTON'S PARADISE LOST.
MILTON chalked out a new and very extra.
ordinary course. As soon as we op)en his Paradise Lost, we are introduced into an invisible
world, and surrounded by celestial and infernal
beings. Angiels and devils are not his machinery, but his principal actors. What in any other
work would be the marvellous, is in this the natural course of events; and doubts may arise,
whether his poem be strictly an epic composition. But whether it be so or not, it is certainly one of the highest efforts of poetical genius;
and in one great characteristic of epic poetry,
majesty and sublimity, is equal to any that bears
this name.
The subject of his poem led Milton upon difficult ground. If it had been more human and
less theological; if his occurrences had been
tnore connected with real life; if he had afforded a greater display of the characters and passions of men; his poem would have been more
pleasing to most readers. IHis subject, however, was peculiarly suited to the daring sublimity of his genius. As he alone was fitted fobr it,
so he has shown in the conduct of it a wonderful,tretch of imagination and invention. From  a
fiw hints, given in the Sacred Scriptures, he
lhas raised a regular structure, and filled his poem with a variety of incidents. He is sometimes
dry and harsh; and too often the metaphysician
and divine. But the general tenor of his work
is interesting, e'levated, and affecting.  The
artf'ul change of his objects, and the scene, laid
now in heaven, now on earth, and now in hell,
afford sufficient diversity; while unity of plan is
perfectly supported. Calm scenes are exhibitk2 1I72  LTON,S PARADISE LoUST.
ed in the employments of Adam and Eve, i;
Paradise 1 and busy scenes, and great actioirs in
the enterprises of Satan, and in the wars of angels. The amiable innocence of our First Parents, and the proud ainbition of Satan; afford a
happy contrast through the whole poem, which
gives it an uncommon charm. But the conclusion perhaps is too tragic for epic poetry.
The subject naturally adm-itsno great display
of character; but such as could be iBtroducedl,
are properly supported.  Satan, makes a itriking figuire; and is the best drawn character in
the poem. Milton has artfilly given him a
nmixed character, not altogether void of some
good qualities. He is brave, and faithful to his
troops. Amid his impiety he is not without remorse. He is even touched with pity for our
First Parents; and firom the necessity of his situation justifies his design against them. He is
actuated by ambition and resentment, rather
than by pure malice. The characters 6f Bel..
zebub, Moloch, an(d Belial, are well painted.
The good angels, though described with dignity,
have more uniformity of character. Among
them, however, the mild condescension of Raphael and the tried fidelity of Abdiel, form proper characteristic distinctions. The attempt to
-describe God Almighty himself, was too bold4
and accordlingly most unsuccessful. The innocence of our First Parents is delicately painted.
In some speeches, perhaps, Adam appears too
knowing and refined for his situation. Eve is

DRAMATIC POETRY. TRAGEDY.
IN all civilized nations, dramatic poetry has
been a favorite amusement. It divides itself
into the two forms of tragedy and comedy.. Of
these, tragedy is the most dignified; as great
and serious objects interest us more than little
and ludicrous ones. Trhe former rests on the
high passions, the virtues, crimes, and sufferings of mankind; the latter, on their humours,
follies, and pleasure; and ridicule is its sole instrument.
Tragedy is a direct imitation of human manners anl actions. It does not, like an epic poem, exhibit characters by description or narration; it sets the personages before us, and
makes them act and speak with propriety. Thisspecies of writing, therefore, requires deep
knowledge of the human heart;    and, when
happily executed, it has the power of raising
the strongest emotions.
In its general strain and spirit, tragedy is favourable to virtue. Characters of honor claim
our respect and approbation; and, to raise indignation, we must paint a person in the odious
colors of vice and depravity.  Virtuous men
indeed are often represented by the tragic poet,
as unfortunate; for this happens in real life.
But he always engages our hearts in their behalf; and never represents vice as finally triumphant and happy. Upon the same principle,
if bad men sncceed in their designs, they are yet
finally conducted to punishment. It may therefore be ccncluded, that tragedies are moral
compositions..It is affirmed by Aristotle, that the design of
tragedy is to purge our passions by means of
pity and terror. But, perhaps, it would have
been more accurate, to have said, that the object of this species of composition is to improve
our virtuous sensibility. If a writer excite our
pity for the afflicted, inspire us with proper sentiments on beholding the vicissitudes of life, and
sti-mulate us to avoid the misfbrtunes of oithers
by exhibiting their errors, he has accomplished
all the moral purposes of tragedy.
In a tragedy it is necessary to have an interesting story, and that the writer conduct it in a
natural and probable manner. For the end of
tragedy is-not so nuch to elevate the imagination as to affect the heart. T'his principle,
which is founded on the clearest reason, excludes from tragedy all mnachineryv or fabulous

intervention of gods. Ghosts alone, from their
foundation in popular belief, hare maintained
their place in tragedy.
To- promote an impression of probability, the
story of a tragedy, according to some critics,
should never be a pure fiction, but onght to be
btuilt on real facts.  This, however, is carrying
the matter toe far. For a fictitious tale, if properly conducted, will melt the heart as much as
real history. Hence, the tragic poet mixes many fictitiols circumsta,ices with well known
facts. Most readers never think of separating
the historical from the fablulous. They attend
only to what is probable, and are touched by
even!s, th;at resemble nature.  Accordingly
some of the most affecting tragedies are entirely
fictitious in their subjects. Such are the. Fair
Penitent, Dougltas, and the Orphan.
In its origin, tragedy was rude and imperfect
Among the Greeks it was at first nothing more
than the song, which vas sung at the festival
of Bacchus.   These songs  were sometimes
sung by the whole company, and sometimes by
separate bands, answering alternately to enac
other, and making a chorus.  To -give this entertainment some variety, Thespis, who lived
about five hundred years before the Christian
era, introduced a person between the songs,
who made a recitation in verse. Eschylus, who
lived fifty years after him, introduced a dialogue between two persons or actors, crwvprehendling some interesting story; and placed
them on a stage adorned with scenery.  The
drama nowv began to assume a regular folm;
and was soon after brought to perfection by Sophocles and Eurypides.It thus appears that the chorus was the foundation of tragedy. But what is remarkable, the
dramatic dialogue, which was only an addition
to it, at length became the principal part of the
entertainment; and the chorus, losing its dignity, came to be accounted only an accessary in
tragedy. At last, in modern tragedy, it has entirely disappeared; and its absence from the
stage, forms the chief distinction between the
ancient and modern drama,
The chorus, it must be allowed, rendered
tragedy more magnificent, instructive, and moral. Butt on the other hand, it was unnatural,
and lessened the interest of the piece. It removed tie representation from the resemblance
of life. It has accordingly been with propriety
excluded from the stage.
The three unities of action, place, and time,
have been considered as essential to the proper conduct of dramatic fable. Of these three,
unity of action is undoubtedly most important.
This consists in the relation which all the incidents introduced, bear to senme design or effect,
combining them nattrally into one whole. This
unity of subject is most essential to tragedy.For a multiplicity of plots, by distracting the attention, prevents the passions from rising to any
height. H-lence i he absurdity of two independent actions in the same play.  rhere may indeed be underplots; but the poet should make
these subservient to the main action. They
should conspire to bring ftor;ard the catastrophe of the play.

of Cato, a nnoble personage, and supported by
the author withi-much dignity. But all the love
scenes in the play; the passion of Cato's two
sons for Lucia, and that of Juba for Cato's
daughter, are mere episodes. They break the
unity of the subject, and form a very unseasonable junction of gallantry, -with high sentiments
of patriotism.
Unity of action must not, however, be confounded with simplicity of plot.  Unity' and
simplicity import different things in dranlatic
composition. The plot is simple, when a small
1numnber of incidentss i introduced into it. With
respect to plots, the ancients were more simple
than the moderns. The Greek tragedies appear indeed to be too naked, and destitute of interesting events. The mederns admit a much
greater.variety of incidents; which is certaialy
an improvement, as it renders the entertainmeat more animated and more instructive. It
may, however, be carried too far; for an overcharge of action aud intrigue produces perplexity and embarrassment. Of this, the Mlourning
Bride of Cougreve is an example.  The incidents succeed each other too rapidly; and the
catastrophe, iwhich ought to be plain and simple, is artificial and intricate.
Unity ef action must be maintained, not only
iu the general constriuction of the fable, but in
all the acts and scenes of the play  The division of every play into five acts is founded merely on cotmmon practice, and the authority of
Horae.
Neve ininor, ineu sit quinto produotior actu
Fabuia.
The:e is nothing in nature which fixes this rule.On the Greek stage the division by acts was unknown. The word act never occurs once in
the Poetics of Aristotle. Practice, however,
has established this division; and the poet must
be careful that each act terminate in a proper
place. The first act should contain a clear exposition of the subject. It sbould excite curiosity, and introduce the personages to the acqgaintance of the spectators.  During the second, third, and fourth acts, the plots should
gradually thicken.  Trhe passiotis should be
keptconstantly awake. There should be no
scenes of idle conversation or mere declamation.
The suspense and concern of the spectators
should be excited more and more. This is the
great excellency of Shakespeare. Sentirnent,
passion, pity, and terror, should pervade every
trVedy.
In the fifth act, which is the seat of the catastrophe, the author should most fully display his
art and genius. The first requisite is, that the
unravelling of the plot be brought about by
probable and natural means.  Secondly, the
catastrophe should be simple, depending on few
events, and including but few persons. Passionate sensibility languishes when dividedt
among many objects. Lastly, in the catastrophe, every thing should be warm and glowi.ng;
an(d the poet must be simple, serious, and pa.
thetic; using no language but that of nature.
It is not essential to the catastrophe of a tragedy that it end happily. Sufficient distress
and agitation, with many tender emotions may
be raised, in the course of the play. But in
general the spirit of tragedy leans to the side
TRAGE-DY.,3t.O        D.RAz5ATIC POLETRY.
of leaving the impression of virtuots sorrow
strong upon the mind.
A curious question here occurs; how happens it, that the emotions of sorrow in tragedy
afford gratification to the nrind? It seein to be
the constitution of our nature, that all the social passions sheuld be attended with pleasurxe.
HIence nothing is more pleasing than love and
friendship. Pity is, for wise ends, a strong instinct; and it necessarily produces some distress on account of its symppathy wlth sufferers.
The heart is at the same mom-nt warmed by
kindness, and afilieted by distress.  Upon the
whole, the state of the mind is agreeable.  We
are pleased with ourselves, not only for our
benevolence, but for our sensibility V Te pain
of svmpathy is also dim;nished by recMalecting
that' the distress is not real; and by the power
of action and sentiment, of language and poetry.
After treating of the acts of a play, it is proper to notice the scenes, The entrance of a new
person upon the stage, forms what is called a
new scene. These scenes or successive conversations, should be closely conneeted; and
imuch of the art of dramatic composition consists in maintaining this connection- For this
purpose two rules must be observed. 1. During the course of one act the stage should never
be lett empty a moment, for this would make a
gap in therepresentation. Wienever the stage
is evacuated, the act is closed.  This rule is
generally observed by French tragedians; but
it is much neglected by the English. 2. No
person should come upon the stage, or leave it,
without some apparent reason. If this rule be
neglected, the dramatis personae are little bet.ter than so many puppets; for the drama professes imitationr of real transactions.
To unity of action, critics have added the
unities of time and place.  Unity of place, requires the scene never to be shifted; that the
action of the play ccntinue in the same place
where it began. Unity of time, strictly' taken,
requires that the time of the action be no lorger,
than the time allowed fbr the representation of
the play. Aristotle, however, permits the action to comprehend a whole day. These rules
are intended to bring the imitation nearer to reality.
Among the Greeks there was no division of
acts. In modern times the practice has prevailed ot suspending the spectacle some little time
between the acts. This practice gives latitude
to the imagination, and renders strict confinement to tiirie and place less necessary. Upon
this account, therefore, too strict an observance
of these unities should not be preferred to higlher beauties of execution, nor to the introduction
of more pathetic situations. But transgressions
of these unities, though they may be often advantageous, ought not to be too frequent, nor
violent. tlurrying the spectator from one distant city to another, or makling several days or
weeks pass during the representation, would
shock the imagination too much, and therefore
cannot be al;owede in a dramatic writer.
Having exanined dramatic action, we shall
nowv attend to the characters, most proper to be
exhibited in a tragedy. Several critics affirn
that the nature of tragedy requires the priwcipal personages to be always of high or princely'rank; as the sufferings of such persons seize

the heart most forcibly. Bult this is more specious than solid. For the distresses of Desdemona, Monimia, and Belvidera, interest us as
much, as if they had been princesses or queens.
It is sufficient, that in tragedy there be nothint
degrading or mean in the personages exhibited.
High rank may render the spectacle more
splendid; but it is the tale itself, and the art of
the poet, that make it interesting and pathetic.
In describing his characters, the poet should
be careful so to order the incidents, which relate
to them, as to impress the s-pectators tvith favourable ideas of virtue, and of the divine administration. Pity should be raised for the virtuous
in distress; and the author should studiously
beware of makiog such representations of life,
as would render virtue an object of aversion.
Unmixed characters, either of goofd or ill
men, are not, in the opinion of Aristotle, fit for
tragedy. For the distresses of the former, asunmerited, hurt us; and the suffering, of the latter excite no compassion.  Mixed characters
afford the best field for displaying, without in.
jury to morals, the vicissitudes of life.  They
interest us the most deeply; and.their distresses are most instructive, when represented as
springing out od their own passions, or as originating in some weakness, incident to human
nature.
The Greek tragedies are often founded on
mere destiny and inevitable misfortunes.  Modern tragedy aims at a higher object, and talies a
wider range; as it shows the direful effects of
ambition, jealousy, love, resentment, and of every strong emotion.   But of all the passio.ns
which furnish mnatter for tragedy, love has mostTRAGOEBY.               283
occupied the m,)dern stages. To the ancient
theatre, love was almost unknown. This proceeded from the national manners of the
Greeks, which encouraged a greater separation
of the sexes, than takes place in modern times;
and did not admit female actors upon the ancient stage; a circumstance, which operated
a.ainst the introduction of love stories. No
solid reason, however, can be assigned for this
predominancy oflove upon the stage. Indeed
it not only limits the natural extent of tragedy,
but degrades its majesty. Mixing it with the
great and solemtn revolutions of human fortune,
tends to give tragedy the air of gallantry and
juvenile entertainment, Without any assistance
from  love, the drama is capable of producing
its highest effects upon the mind.
Beside the arrangement of his subject, and
the conduct of his personages, the. tragic poet
must attend to the propriety of his sentiments.
These must be suited to the characters of the
persons, to whom they are attributed, and to
the situations, in which they are placed. It is
chiefly in the pathetic lparts, that the difficulty
and inportance of this rule are greatest. We
go to a tragedy, expecting to be moved; and,
if the poet cannot reach the heart, he has no
tragic merit; and we return cold and disap.

To paint and to excite passion strongly; are
prerogatives of genius. They require not only
ardent sensibility, but the power of entering
deeply into characters. It is here, that candi.

his feelings are; yet this sort o~f se'londary description, tragic poets often give us, instead of

This maight have proceeded from a bystander, or an indifferent person; buit it is altogether improper in. thie mouth of PortiuT.  Similar
to this dcescriptive language, are the unnatural
and forcedi thought~, which tragic poets somtetimes, employ, to exaggerate the feelings of
persons, whom they wishi to paint, as strongly

Moral sentimonts and reflections ought not to
recur very frequently in tragedy. W11hen iunseasonably crowded, they lose their effect, and
convey an air of pedantry. When introduced
with propriety, they give dignitv to the compo.
sition. Cardinal Wolsey's soliloquy on his fall,
is a fine instance of the felicity with which they
may be employed. Much of the merit of Ad.
dison's Cato depends on that moral turn of
thought which distinguishes it.
T%re style and versification of tragedy shonld
be free, easy, and varied. English blank verse
is happily suited to this species of composition.
It has sufficient majesty, and can (descend to the
simple and familiar; it admits a happy variety
of cadence, and is free from the constraint and
monotony of rhyme. Of the French tragedies
it is a great misfortune, that they are always in
rhyme. For it fetters the freedom of the tragic dialogue, fills it with a languid monotony,
and is fatal to the power of passion.

rhyme, and those strings of couplets, with
which it was some titme ago fashionable to conclude the acts of tragedyv and sometimes the

GREEK TRAGEDY.
THE plot of Greek tragedy was exceedingly
simple; the incidents few; and the conduct
very exact with regard to the unities of action.
time and place. Machinery, or the intervention of gods, was employed; and what was very
faulty, the final unravelling was sometimes
made to turn upon it. Love, one or two instances  excepted, was never admnitted into
Greek tragedy. A vein of morality and religion always runs through it; but they employed less than the mederns, the combat of the
passions. Their plots were all taker fram the
ancient traditionary stories of their' own nation.
Eschylus,'the, father of Greek traged(y, exhibits both the beauties and defects of an early
original writer. He is bold, nervous, and animated; but very obscure, and difficult to be
understood. His slyle is highly metapborical,
and often harsh and tumnid. He aboua4s in martial ideas and descriptioias, has muoh fire and elevation, and little tendernees. He,also delights in the marvellous.
The most masterly of the Greek tragedians is
SophoclesJ. He is the most correct in the c.onduct osfhis subjects; the most just and sublime
in his sentiments. Ia descriptive talents he is
also eminent.  E'sypides is accounted more
tender than Sophocles; he is fuller of moral
sentiments; but he is less correct ia the.qonSUBLITUITY IN WRITING.           2#
When an author has brouglt us, or is end.eavoring to bring us into this state, if he multiply
words unnecessarily; if he deck the sublime
object on all sides with glittering ornaments;
nay, if he throw in any one decoration which
falls in the least below the principal image;
that moment he changes the key; he relaxes the
tension of the mind; the strength of- the foeling
is emasculated; the beautiful may remain; but
the sublime is extinguished.  Homer's description of the ned of Jupiter, as slaking the heavens, has been admired in all ages, as wonderfully sublime. Literally translated, it runs
thus; "He spoke, and bending his sable brows,
gave the awful nod; while he shook the celestial locks of his immortal bead, all Olympus was
shaken."   Mr. Pope translates it thuis;
He spoke and awvul htnds his sable brows,
Shakes liis ambrosia I curls, and gives the ntod
Thie stamp of tate, and sanction of a God;
High heaven with tremblingtlie dreadl signal took,
And All Olympue to its centre shook.
The image js expanded, and attempted to be
beautified; butin reality it is weakened.  The
third line, "The stamp of fate, alid sanction of a
God," is entirely expletive, and introduced only
to fill up the rhyme; forit interrupts the des.
cription, and clogs the image.  For the same
reason Jupiter is represented, as shaking his
locks, before he gave the nod;". Shakes his aiibrosial curls, and gives tte nod;" which is

FRENCH TRAGEDY.'IN the compositions of some French dramatic writers, tragedy has appeared with
great lustre; particularly Corneille, Racine and
Voltaire. They have improved upon the ancients, by introducing more incidents, a greater
variety of passions, and a fuller display of characters. Like the ancients, they excel iit regularity of conduct; and their style is poetical
and elegant.  But, to an English taste, they
want strength and passion, and are too declamatory and refined. They seem afraid of being
too tragic; and it was the opinion of Voltaire,
that, to the perfection of tragedy, it is necessary to unite the vehemence and action of the
English theatre, with the correctness and decorum of the French.
Corneille, the father of French tragedy, is
distinguished by majesty of sentiment, and fruit.
ful imagination. His genius was rich, but more
turned to the epic, than the tragic vein. He is
magnificent and splendid, rather than touching
and tender. He is full of declamation, impetuous and extravagant.
In tragedy, Racine is superior to Corneille.
He wants, indeed, the copiousness- of Corneille;
but he is free from his bombast, and excels him
greatly in tenderness. The beauty of his language and versification is uncommon; and he
hlas managed his rhymes with superior advantage.
Voltaire is not inferior to his predecessors ia
the drama; and in one article he has outdone
them; the delicate and interesting situations he
has introdtced. Here lies his chief strength.

ENGLISI-I TRAGEDY.
IT has often been remarked of tragedy in
Great Britaip, that it is more ardent than that of
France, but more irregular and incorrect. It
has, therefore, excelled in the soul of tragedy.
For the pathetic must be allowed to be the chief
excellence of the tragic muse.
The first object on the English theatre, is the
great Shakspeare.  In extent and force of genius, both for tragedy and comedy, he is unrivalled. But, at the same time, it is genius shooting
wild, deficient in taste, not always chaste, and
unassisted by art and knowledge.  Criticism has
been exhausted in commentaries upon hitm; yet,
to this day, it is undecided, whether his beauties
or defects be greatest.  In his writings there
are admirable scenes and passages without numENGLISH TRAGEDY.            29,
ber; but there is not one of his plays which
can be pronounced a good one.   Beside extreme irregularities in conduct, and grotesque
mixtures of the serious and comic, we are frequently disturbed by unnatural thoughts, harsh
expressions, and a certain obscure bombast, and
play upon words. These faults are, however,
compensated by two of the greatest excellencies
a tragic poet can possess, his lively and diversified painting ef character, and his strong and
natural expressions of passion. On these two
virtues his merit rests. In the midst of his absurdities, he interests and moves us; so great is
his skill in human nature, and so lively his representations of it.
He possesses also the merit of having created
for himself, a world of preternatural beings.
His witches, ghosts, fairies, and spirits of' all
kinds, are so awful, mysterious, and peculiar, as
strongly to affect the imagination.  His two
master.pieces are his Othello  and Macbeth.
With regard to his historical plays, they are neither tragedies, nor comedies; but a peculiar
species of dramatic entertainment, in which he
describes the characters, events, and manners
of the times of which he treats.
Since Shakspeare, there are few English
dramatic writers, whose whole works are entitled to high praise. There are several trage(lies, however, of considerable merit. Lee's
Theodosius has warmth and tenderness, though
romantic in the plan, and extravagant in the
sentiments. Otway is great in his Orphan and
Venice Preserved. Perhaps, however, he is
too tragic in these pieces. He had genius and
strong passions, but was very indelicate.UZJI              QUESTIONS.
The tragedies of Rowe abound in morality,
and in elevated.sentiments. His poetry is good,
and his langulage pure and elegant. He is, notwithstanding, too cold and uninteresting; and
flowery, rather than tragic. His best dramas
are Jane Shore, and the Fair Penitent, which
excel in the tender and pathetic.
Dr. Young's Revenge, discovers genius and
fire; but wants tenderness, and turns too much
on the direful passions. In the Mourning Bride
of Congreve, there are fine situations and much
good poetry. The tragedies of Thomson, are
too full of a stiff morality, which renders them
dull and formal.  His Tancred and Sigismunda
is his master-piece; and for the plot, characters, and sentiments, justly deserves a place
among the best English tragedies.;
A Greek tragedy is a simple relation of an
interesting incident. A French tragedy is a seAres of artful and refined conversations. An
English tragedy is a combat of strong passions,
set before us in all their violence, producing
deep disasters, and filling the spectators with
grief. Ancient tragedies are mQre natural and
simple; modern more artful and complex.

COMEDY.
THE strain and spirit of comedy, discrimipate it sufficiently from tragedy.  While pity,
terror, and the other strong passions form the
province of the latter, the sole instrument of
the formeris ridicule.  Follies and vices, and
whatever in the human character is improper,
or exposes to censure and ridicule, are objects of
comedy. As a satirical exhibition of the improprieties and follies of men, it is useful and
moral. It is commendable by this species of
composition, to correct, a.nd to polish the manners of men. Many vices are more successfully
exploded by ridicule, than by serious arguments.
It is possible, however, to employ ridicule improperly; and by its operation to do mischief
instead of good. For ridicule is far from being
a proper test of truth.   Licentious writers
therefore of the comic class, have often cast/
ridicule on objects and characters which did not
deserve it. But this is not the fault of comedy,
but of the turn and genius of certain writers. In
the hands of loose men, comedy will mislead
and corrupt; but in those of virtuous writers, it
is not only a gay and innocent, but a. laudable
and useful entertainment.  English comedy,
however, is frequently a school of vice.
The rules of dramatic action, that were prescribed for tragedy. belong also to comedy. A
comic writer must observe the unities of action,

time and place. He must attend to nature and
probability. The imitation of manners ought
to be even more exact in comedy than in tragedy; for the subjects of comedy are more familiar and better known.
The subjects of tragedy are confined to no
age nor country; but it is otherwise in comedy.
For the decorums of behaviour,' and the nice
discrimihations of character, which are the subjects oftomedy, change with time and country;
and are never so well understood by foreigners,
as by natives.  We weep for the heroes of
Greece and Rome; but we are touched by the
ridicule of such manners and characters only as
we see and know.   The scene therefore of
comedy, should always be laid in the author's
own country and age. The comic poet catches
the manners living, as they rise.
It is true, indeed, that Plautus and Terence
did not follow this rule. The scene of their
comedies is laid in Greece, and they adopted the
Greek laws and customs. But it is to be remembered, that comedy was in their age, a new
entertainment in Rome, and that they were
contented with the praise of translating Menander and other comic writers of Greece. In posterior times the Romans had the " Comedia Togata," or what was founded on their own manners, as well as the " Comedia Palliata," which
was from the Greeks.
There are two kinds of comedy, that of character and that of intrigue. In the last, the plot
or action of the play is the principal object. In
the first, the display of a peculiar character is
the chief point; and to this the action is suborndinate. The French abound most in comedies
of character. Such are the capital pieces of
Moliere. The English have inclined more to
comedies of intrigue. Such are the plays of
Congreve; and in general there is more story,
action, and bustle in English, than in French
comedy.
The perfection of comedy is to be found in a
proper mixture of these two kinds. Mere conversation without an interesting story is insipid.
There should ever be so much intrigue, as to
excite both fears and wishes. The incidents
should be striking, and afford a proper field for
the exhibition of character. The piece, however, should not be overcharged with intrigue;
for this would be to: convert a comedy into a
novel.
With respect to characters, it is a common
error of comic writers to carry them much beyond real life; indeed it is very difficult to hit
the precise point, where wit ends and buffoonery begins. The comedian may exaggerate; but
good sense must teach him where to stop.
In comedy there ought to be a clear distinction in characters. The contrast of characters,
however, by pairs, and by opposites, is too
theatrical and affected.  It is often the perfection of art to conceal art. A masterly writer
gives us his characters, distinguished rather by
such shades of diversity, as. are commonly
found in society, than marked by such oppositions as are seldom brought into actual contrast
in any of the circumstances of life.
The style of comedy ought to be pure, lively,
and elegant, generally imitating the tone of,polite conversation, and never descending into

gross expressions.  Rhyme is not suitable to
comic composition: for, what has poetry to do
with the conversation of men in common life?
The current,of the dialogue shomld be easy
without pertness, and genteel without flippancy.
The wit should never be studied, nor unseasonable.

ANCTENT COMEDY.
THE ancient comedy was an avowed satire
against particular persons, brought upon the
stage by name. Such are the plays of Aristophanes; and compositions of so singular a Ra.
ture, illustrate well the turbulent anld licentious
state of Athens.  The most illustrious personages, generals, and magistrates, were then made
the subjects of comedy.  Vivacity, satire, and
buffoonery, are the  characteristics of Aristophanes.  On many occasions he displays genius
and tforce; but his performances give us no high.idea of the attic taste for wit in his age.  HisANCIENT COMfED Y.
ridicule is extravagant; his wit farcical; his
personal raillery cruel and biting; and his obscenity intolerable.
Soon after the age of Aristophanes, the liberty of attacking persons by name, on the stage,
was prohibited by law. The middle comedy
then took its rise. Living persons were still attacked, but under fictitious names. Of these
pieces we have no remains. They were succeeded by the new comedy; when it became,
as it isnow, the business of the stage to exhibit
manners and characters, but not those of particular persons. The author of this kind, most
celebrated among the Greeks, was Menander;
but his writings are perished.
Of the new comedy of the ancients, the only
remains are the plays of Plautus and Terence.
The first is eminent for the vis comica, and for
an expressive phraseology. He bears, howev.
er, many marks of the rudeness of the dramatic
art, in his time.  He has too much low wit and
scurrility; and is by far too quaint and full of
conceit. He has more variety and force than
Terence; and his characters are strongly marked, though sometimes coarsely.
Terence is polished, delicate, and elegant.
His style is a model of the most pure aid gracefill latinity. EHis dialogue is always correct and
decent; and his relations have a picturesque
and beautiful simplicity. His morality is in general unexceptionable; his situations are interesting; and many of his sentiments touch the
heart. He may be considered as the founder
of serious comedy.    In  sprightliness and
strength he is deficient.  There is a sameness
in his character and plots; and he is said to have

SPANISH COMEDY,
THE most prominent object in modern come.
dy is the Spanish theatre. The chief comedians of Spain are Lopez de Vega, Guillen, and
Calderon. The first, who is the most famous of
them, wrote above a thousand plays; and was
infinitely more irregular than Shakspeare. He
totally disregarded the three unities, and every
established rule of dramatic writing. One play
often includes many years, and even the whole
life of a man. The scene, during the first act
is in Spain; the next in Italy; and the third in
Africa. His plays are chiefly historical; and are
a mixture of heroic speeches, serious incidents,
war and slaughter, ridicule and buffoonery. He
jumbles together christianity and paganism, virtues and vices, angels and gods. Notwithstanding his faults,, he possessed genius, and great
force of imagination. Manv of his characters
are well painted; many of his situations are

apologized for them from the prevailing taste
of his countrymen.

FRrENCIt COMNEDY.
THE comic theatre of France is allowed to
be correct, chaste, and decent. The comic author in whom the French glory most, is Moliere.
In the judgment of French critics, he has nearly
reached the summit of perfection in his art.
Nor is this the decision of mere partiality.  Mo.
liere is the satirist oliy of vice and folly.  His
characters were peculiar to his own times; and
in general, his ridicule was justly directed.  His
comic powers were great; and his pleasantry is
alw ays innocent. His Misanthrope, and. Tartuffe are in verse, and constitute a kind of dignified comedy, in which vice is exposed in the
style of elegant and polite satire. In his prose
comedies there is a profusion of ridicule; but
the poet never gives alarm  to modesty, nor
casts contempt on virtue.  With  these high
qualities, however, considerable defects are
mingled. In unravelling his plots he is unhappy; as this is frequently brought- on with
to li-ttle preparation, and in an improbable300            ENGLISTI COMEDY.
manner. In his verse comedies he is not always
sufficiently interesting; and he is too full of
long speeches. In his risible pieces in prose be
is too farcical. But upon the whole it may be
affirmed, that few writers ever attained so perfectly the true!end of comedy. His Tartuffe
and Avare are his two capital productions.

France? 2. Who is the most celebrated French
comic author? 3. Was the praise bestowed on him by

ENGLISTI COMEDY
FROM the English theatre is naturally expected a greater variety of original characters in
comedy, and bolder strokes of wit and humor,
than from any other modern stage. Humor is
in some d,%gree peculiar to Englanod. The freedom of the govei-nsent, and the unrestrained
liberty of English manners, are faverabie to hiiumor and singularity of character.  In France
the influence of a despotic court spread unifprmity over the nation, Hence comedy lits a more
ampl;fiedl and a ffreer vein in Britain than in
France. But it is to be regrett.ld, that the cornic spirit of l3ritain is often disgraced by indecency and licentiousness.
The first age, however, of English comedy
was not infected by this spirit. The plays of
Shakspeare and Ben Johnson have no immoral
tendency. The comedies of the forner display
a strong, creative genius; but are irregular inENGLISH COMEDY.o
conduct. They are singularly rich in characters and manners; but often descend to please
the mob. Johnson is more regular, but stiff
and pedantic; though not void of dramatic genius. Much fancy and invention, and many fine
passages, are found in the plays of Beaumont and
Fletcher. But, in general, they abound in dramatic incidents, unnatural characters, and coarse
allusions.
Change of manners has rendered the comedies of the last age obsolete. For it is the exhibition of prevailing modes and characters, that
gives a charm to comedy.  Thus Plautus was
antiquated to the Romans in the days of Angustus. But to the honor of Shakspeare, his Falstaff is still admired, and his Merry Wives of
Windsor read with pleasure.
After the restoration of Charles II. the licentio'sness which polluted the court and nation,
seized upon comedy. The rake became the
predominant character.  Ridicule was thrown
upon chastity and sobriety. At the end of the
play, indeed the rake becomes a sober man;
but through the performance he is a fine gentleman, and exhibits a picture of the pleasurable
enjoyments of life. This spirit of comedy had
the worst effect on youth of both sexes, and con.
tinned to the days of George IF.
In the comedies of Dryden, there are many
strokes of genius; but he is hasty and careless.
As his object was to please, he followed the current of the times, and gave way to indelicacy
and licentiousness. His indecency was, at times,
so gross, as to occasion a prohibition of his plays
on the stage.
301302            ENGLISH COMEY,.
After Dryden, flourished Cibber, Vanburgh,
Farquhar, and Congreve. Cibber has sprighttli
ness and a pert vivacity; but his incidents are
so forced and innatural, that his performances
have all sunk into obscurity, excepting The
Careless Husband, and The Provoked Husband.
Of these the first is remarkable for the easy politeness of the dialogue; and it is tolerably moralin its conduct. The latter, in which Cibber
was assisted by Vanburgh, is perhaps the best
comedy in the English language; and even to
this it may be objected, that it has a double plot.
Its characters, however, are natural, and it
abounds with fine painting and happy strokes of
humor.
Wit, spirit. and ease, characterize Sir John
Vanburgh; but he is the most indelicate and
immoral of all our comedians.  Congreve undoubtedly possessed genius.  He is witty anti
sparkling, and full of character and action. Indeed he overflows with wit; for, it is often introduced unseasonably; and, in general, there
is too much of it fobr well bred conversation.
Farquharis a light and gay writer; less correct and less brilliant than Congreve; but he
has more ease, and much of the vis comica.
Like Congreve he is licentio~is; and modesty
must turn from them   both with abhorrence.
The French boast with justice of the superior
decency of their stage, and speak of the English
theatre with astonishment. Their philosophical writers ascribe the profligate manners of
London to the indelicacy  and corruption of
English corne(ly.
Of late years a sensible reformation has taken
place in Englisl comedy. Our writers of comedy nowappear ashamed of the indecency of
their predecessors.  They may be inferior to
Farquhar and Congreve in spirit, ease and wit;
but they have the merit of being far more innocent and moral.
To the French stage we are much indebted
for this reformation. The introduction within
a few years of a graver comedy in France, called the serious or tender comedy, has attracted
the attention and approbation of our writers.
Gaiety and-ridicule are not excluded from this
species of comedy; but it lays the chief stress
on tender and interesting situations. It is sentimental, and touches the heart. It pleases not
so nmuch by the laughter it excites, as by thetears of affection and joy which it draws forth.
This form of comedy was opposed in France,
as arn unjustifiable innovation. It was objected
by critics that it was not founded on laughter
and ridicule; but it is not necessary that all
comedies be formed on one precise model.
Some may be gay; some serious; and some
may partake of both qualities. Serious and
tender comedy has no right to exclude gaiety
and ridicule from the stage. There are materials for both; and the stage is richer for the
innovation. In general, it may be considered
as a mark of increasing politeness and refinement, when those theatrical exhibitions become
fashionable, which are free from indelicate sentiment and an immoral tendency.

point of view.  For, every oobject has several
faces, by which it may be presented to us, according to the circumstances with which we
surroundit; and it will appear superlatively
sublime, or not, in proportion as these circumstances are lyippily chosen, and of the sublime
kind.  In this, the great art of thie writer consist,; and indeed the principal difficulty of sublime description.  If the description be too general, and divested of circumstances; the object is shown in a faint light, and makes a
feeble impression', or no impression, on the
reader.  At the same time, if any trivial or irn.
proper circumstances be mingled,'the whole
is degrad;d.
The natutre of that emotion, which is aimed
at by sublime description, admits no mediocrity,
and- cannrot subsist in a middle state; but must
either highly transport us; or, if unsuccessful in
the execution, leave us exceedingly disgusted.
We attempt to rise with the writer; the imagination is awakened, and put upon the stretch;
but it ought to be suppo'ted; and, if in the
midst of its effort it be deserted unexpectedly,
it falls with a painful shock. When Milton, in
his battle of the angels, de,scribes them, as tearitng up mountains, add throwing them at one another  there are in his description, as Mr. Ad.
dison has remarked, no circumstances, but what
are truly sublime;
From their foundations Iood'ning to and fro,'T'hiey pluek'd the seated hills with all their load,
]Rocks, watePs, woods; and by t!e shaggy tops
Uplifting bore them with their hands.This idea of giants thirowing the mnountains,
which is in itself so grand, Claudian renders burCs30i      %Su'JBLIIITY IN WRITING,
lesque and ridiculous, by the single circumstancq
of one of his giants with the mountain Ida upon
his shoulders, and a river, which flowed from
the mnountain, runn-ing down the giartt's back, as
he held it up in that posture.  Virgil, in his description of mount Etna, is guilty of a slight in.
accuracy of this kind.   After several magnificent images, the poet corncludes with personifying the mountain under this figure,
-,' Eructans viscera curm gemitu--"'; belching up its bowels with a groan'? whNchb
by making the mountain resembil a sick or
drunken person, degrades the majesty of the
description. The debasing effect of this idea
will appear in a stronger light, from  observing
what figure it makes in a poeP of Sir Richard
Blackmore; who, through an extravagant perversity of taste, selected it for the principal circumstance in his description   and thereby, as
Dr. Arbuthnot humorously obseryes, represents
ed the mountain, as in a fit of the cholic.
)Etna and all the burning mountains find
Tiheir kindled stores, withl imbred stotmsof winld,
Blowin up to rage, and roaring )ut complain,
As torn with inward gripes and torturing pain;
Labrinsg, thley cast their dreadful vomit round, l
And with tlseir melted bowels spread the ground.
Such instances show how much the sublime
depends upon a proper selection of circumstan-'
ces; anrd with how  great care every circumstance must be avoided, which, by approaching
in the smallest degree to the mean, or even to
the gay or trifling, changes- the tone of the emotion.
What is commonly called the sublime style,
is for the rost part a very bad one, and has no&amp;relation whatever to the true sublime. Writers
are apt to imagine, that splendid words, accumulated epithets, and a certain swelling kind
of expression, by rising above what is customary or vulgar, constitutes the sublime; yet nothing is in reality more false. In genuine instan,
ces of sublime writing, nothing of this kind appears. "God said, let there be light; and there
was light."  This is striking and sublime; but
put it into what is commonly called the sublime
style; "The sovereign Arbiter of nature, by the
potent energy of a single word, commanded the
light to exist;" and, as Boileau justly observed, the style is indeed raised, but the thought is
degraded. In general it may be oAserved, thati
the sublime lies in the thought, not in the.expression; and, when the thought is really noble,
it will generally clothe itself in a native Vajesty
of language.
The faults, opposite to the sublime, are principally two, the frigid and the bonibast. The
frigid consists in degrading an object or sentinent, which is sublime in itself, by a mean
conception of it; orby a weak, low, or puerile
description of it. This betrays entire absence,
or, at least, extreme poverty of genius.  The
bombast lies in forcing a common or trivial object out of its rank, and in laboring to raise it into the sublime; or in attempting to exalt a sublime object beypnd all natural bounds.

BEAITY AND OTHER PLBASURES OP
TASTE.
BEAUTY, next to sublimity, affords the high.
est pleasure to the imagination. The emotio6n
which it raises, is easily distinguished from that
of sub!imity. It is of a calmer kind; more
gentle  and soothing; does not elevate the
mind so pluch, but produces a pleasing serenity.
Sublimity excle-&amp;-f,i~, -t  -ioent to be
lasting-; the pleasure, proceeding from beauty,
admits longer duration. It extends also to a
much greater variety of objects than sublimity;
to a variety indeed so great, that the sensations
which beautiful objects excite, differ exceedingly, not in deigree onlyv, but also in'kind, from
each other. Hence no wprd is used i  a more
undetermined signification than beauty. It is
applied to almost every external object, which
pleases the eye or the ear; to many of the
graces of writing; to several dispositions of the
mind; nay, to some objects of abstract science.
We speak frequently of a beautiful tree or flower; a beautiful poem; a beautiful character i
and a beautiful theorem in mathematics.
Color seems to afford the simplest instance of
beauty. Association of ideas, it is probable, has
some influence on the pleasure, which we receive'from colors.  G-eena, for example, mayBEAUTY AND OTMER
appear m'ore beautiful, from being connected in
our ideas with rural scenes and;prospects;
white with innocence; blue, with the serenity
of the sky. Independently of associations of
this sort, all that we can farther observe respecting colors is, t~at those, chosen for beauty,4
are commonly. delicate, rather than glaring.
Siuch are.the feathers of several kinds 4 birds,
the leaves of flowers, and the fine variation of
colers, shown by the sky, at the rising and' setting of the sun.
Figure opens to us forms of beauty more complex and diversified. Reg:ularity first offers itself as a sour'.e of beauty. By a regular figure
is meant one, which we perceive to be fQrmed
aaccordi~noto some cerinrul. and not left arbitiary oriloose in the construction of its parts.
Thus a circle, a su are, a triangle, or a hexagon, gives pleastire to the eye b)y its regularity,
as a beautiful figure? yet a crtain graceful
Varietyis found to be a much more powertful
pinciple of beauty. Regularity seems to appear beautiful to us chiefly, if not entirely, on
account of its suggesting the ideas of fitness.
propriety, and use, wivhich have always a more
intimate connection with orderly and proportioned form', than wi-fthothse, which appear not
constritcted ac.ording to any certain rule. Nature, who is the mtnost graceful artist, hath, in all
her ornamnental works, p,rsued variety with an
apparent` neglect of re,gularity.  Cabinets,
doors and windows are made after a regular
form, in cribess and parallelograms, with-exact
proportion of parts; and thus formroed, they
please the eye, for this just reason, that being
S4PLEA,suEa. OF~ TASTE.        3
wvorks of use, they are by s'uch f6gured beittex
adapted to'the ends for which they were dgsigned. But plants, flowers, and leaves, art- full
6'f va'riety and diversity. A straight can'jd lis an
insipid figure, when' compared with'the meanders of a xli'ver. Cones and pyramidshave their
diegree of beauty; biut treesc growinag in their
inatur'al wilditess, have infinitel-y more -beauty,
thn he   rmme  inopyramids a'nd cones.
T.he' apartmrents of a house muwt be disposed,
wi'th regularity for the convenieDce,of its inbabitanits;'but agarden, which is intended me-rely,
-forf beauy woulId be extremely disgusting, if it
had as much uniformity anid ord_r a~ a dwelling
house.
Motion affords. another so-urcee of'beauty, distinict from figure. -Motion of itself is pleasing;
and bodies in Motion' are, "1cmteris pariboa,"
universally preferred to those- at rest. Only
getntle mvtioD, however, belojngs to the beauti-.
ful; for, when itis- swift, or very powprfi
suich as that of a torrkent, it partakes of t.bo sublime. The motion of a bird gliding tihirough
the a'ir, is exquisitely beautiful:; but the swiftnswith -which lightning darts tbj'ough the
sky, is magnificent an'd astoni,*ing. Here it i-s
necelsary to) %ohserveo, that the -sensations of sublime and beautiful ar-e not -always di-stinguished
by very distant boUnDarAes; but are capable~ in
mnany inst inr;s -of aproacbin~g toward weach
ot her.  Thus -a grent1e running stream is one of
the modst`be-autifuil objects in nature; but, as it
sWells gioduah1yV into a great river, the beautiful by degrees8is los-t in the su, blime.'A youing
t-re e is-a-rbeautiful Object; a spreading ancien-t2:            3BEAUTY AND OTHER
oakis a venerable and sublime one. - To return, however, to the beauty of motion, it will
be found to hold very generally, that motion in
a straight line is not so beautiful, as in a wavming
direction; and motion upward is commonly
more pleasing than motion downward. The
easy, curling motion of flame and smoke is an
object singularly agreeable. Hogarth observes
very ingeniously, that all the common asn necessary motions for the business of life are performed in straight or plain lines; but that all
the graceful and ornamental movements are
made in curve lines; an observation, worthy the
attention of those, who study the grace of gesture and action.
Color. figure and motion, though separate
principles of beauty, yet in many beautiful ohjetts meet together, and thereby render the
beauty greater and more complex.  Thus in
flowers, trees, and animals, we are entertained
at once with the delicacy of the color, with the
gracefuluess of the figuref and sometimes also
with the mtnotion of the object. The most complete assemblage of bea-ltiful objects, which
can be found, is presented by a richl natural
landscape, where there is asufficient variety of
objects; fields in verdure, scattered trees and
flowers, running water, and animals,grazing.
Irtothese be addedsome of,the productions of
art, suitable to such a scene  as, a bridge with
arches over a river, smoke rising fr.om cottages
in tke midst of trees, and a distant view-of. a fine
buildi'ag, seen by the rising sun; we the-,wenjoy,
in thehighest perfection, that gay, cheerful,
ad placid sensation, wvhich characterizes beauty.XFEA!7REMOF TASTS, 7
T'he beauty of the human countenance ig
more complex than any we have yet examined.
It comprehends the beauty of color, arising from
the delicate shades of the complexion; anti the
beauty of figure, arising from  the lines, whicht
constitute different features of the face.  But
the principal beauty of the countenance delends upon a mysterious expression, wvhich it
conveys, of the qualities of the mind; of good
sense, or good huimor; of candor, benevolence,
sensibility, or other amiable dispositions.  It
miiay be observed, that there are -certai qualities of the mind, which, whether expressed in
the countenance, or by words, or by actions, always raise in us a feeling similar to that of beauty. There are two great classes of moral qualities; one is of the high and the great virtues,
which req(uire extraordinary efforts, and is
founded on dangers and sufferings; as heroism,
magnanimity, contempt of pleasures, and contempt of death. These produce in the spectator an emotioi of sublimity and grandeur.
The other class is chiefly of the social virtnes;
and such, as are of a softer and gentler kind;
as compassion, mildness, and generosity. These
excite in the beholder a sensation of pleasure, so
nearly allied to that excited by beautiful- external objects, that, thongh of a more exalted
nature, it may with propriety be classed under'
the same head.
Beauty of writing, in its more definite sense,
characterizes a particular manner; signifying, a
certain grace and amnenity in the turn either-o~
style or sentiment, by which some authors are
particularly distinguished. In this sense it denotes a mannier neither remarkably sublime nor

vehemently passionate, nor uncommonly sparkling; but such, as excites in the reader an emotion of the placid kind, resembling that? which is
raised bv the contemplation of beautiful objects
in nature; which neither lifts the mrnind very
high, nor agitales it to excess; but spreads
overthe imagination a pleasing serenity. Addison is a writer of ttis character, and one of the
mnost proper examnples of it. Fenel(n,, the anthorof Telemachus, is another example.  Virgil,also, though very capable of rising occasionally into the sublime, yet generally is distin.
guished by the character of beauty and grace,
rather than sublimity. Among orator%, Cicero
has more of the beautiful than Demnsthenes,
whose genius led him  whoily toward vehlemence and strength.
So much it is necessary to have said upon the
subject of beauty; since next to sublimity it is
the most copious source of the pleasures pf
taste. But objects delight the imagisation not
enly by appearing under the forms of sublime or
beautiful; they likewise derive their power ot
giving it pleasure from several other principles.
Novelty, for example, h;as been mentioned by
Addison, anti by everv writer on ibthis subject.
An object which has no other merit, than that
of being new, by this quality alone raises in the
mind a vivid and an agreeable emotion  Hence
that passion of curiosity, which prevails so generally in mankitind.  Objects and ideas which
have been long fanmiliar, make too faint an impression to give an agreeable exercise to our
faculties. New and strange objects rouse the
mind from its dormant state, by giving it a sudden and pleasing impulse.  tience, in a greatPLEASURES OF TASTE.          1

The, pleasures of' mielody and harm-ony belong- also to taste. "There is no delightful sensation, we r-eceive e-ither from. beauty or sublimity, which ii not canpable of being heightened

At prf*ent it is not uaccessar-y -to, -pursue any
farther the subject ef the pleasures of taste.
We hiave opened sorte o-f the general principies; it is timie now to apply them to our chief
subject. If it be a-sked, to what class of those
pleasures of taste, which have. been enumera-.
he,% thtpleasure is to be referred, which waBEAUTY AND OTHER
receive from poetry, eloquence or fine writing?
The answer isS not to any one, but to them all.
Thil! peculiar advantage writing and discourse
possess; they encompass a large and fruitfti
field on all sides, and have power to exhibit in
great perfection, not a single set of objects only,
but almost the whlole of tk&lt;ose, which give pleasure to taste and imagination; whether that
pleasure arise from sublimity, from beauty in its
various forms, from design and art, from  moral
sentiment, from novelty, from harmony, from
wit, humor, or ridicule.  To whichsoever of
these a person's taste is directed, from some
writer or other he has it always in his power to
receive the gratification of it.
It has been usual among critical writers to
treat ofdiscourse, as the chief of all the imitative arts. They compare it with painting and
with sculpture, and in many respects prefer it
justly before them. But we must distinguish
between imitation and description. Words have
no natural resemblance of the ideas or objects
which they signify; but a statue or picture has
a natural likeeness of the original.
As far, however, as a poet or historian introaduces into his work persons really speaking,
aJd by words, which he puts into their mouths,
represents the conversation, nhich they might
be supposed to hold; so far his art may be called imitative; and this is the case in all dramatic
composition.  BnW in narrative or descriptive
workls it cannot with propriety be so callld.
Who, for example, would call Virgil's description of a tempest -in the first,neid an imitation
of astorm? If we heard of the imitation of a
battle, we might naturally think of some mock

fizght. or representation of a battle on the stage;
lbut should never imagine it meant one of Horrmers descriptions in the Iliad.  It rmurst be allowed at the sarne time, that imitation and description agree in their principai effect, that of
recallilg uvoy external signs the ideas of things,
which we do not see.   But, though in this they
coincide. yet it should be remembered, thatthe
terms themniselves are not synonimous; that
they import different means of producing the
same end; and consequently imake different impressior,s on tlhe nmiad.

ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF LANGUAGE.
TO form an adequiate idea of the origin o-f
)iat-uage, we must contemplate the circumstance's of mankind in, their earliest and rudest state.'Ikoy were tbn a wanderi'ng, scattered roce  e~ tATNGUiACE,.no society among thlem except families; and faimnily society also very impertect, as their modo
of livitg, by hunting or pasturage, must have
separated them frequently from each other.
In such a condition, howv could any one set of
sounds or woids be universally agreed on, as
the signs of their ideas? Suppositug that a few
whom chance or necessity thrcw: together,
agreed by some means upon certain signs; yet,
by whlat authority could these be so propagated
among othcr tribes or families, as to grow up
into a language? One would irragine that men
must have been previously gathered together in
considerable numbers, before language could
be fixed and extended; and yet on the other
hilnd there-seems to have been an fhsolute necessity of speech previous to the formation of
society. For by what bond could a multitude
of men be kept together, or be connected in
the prosecution of any common interest,before,
by the assistance of speech, they could communicate their wants and intentions to each other?
So that, how society could subsist previously to
language, and how words could rise into language before the formation of society, seemn to
be points attended with equal difficulty. When
we consider farther that curious analogy, which
prevails in the constfuction of almost all lano
guages, and that deep and subtile logic, on
which they are founded; difficulties increase so
much upon us on all sides, that there seemtns to
be no small reason for referring the origin of
all language to divine inspiration
But, supposing language to have a divine original, we cannot imagine that a perfect system
of it was at once given to man.  It is much
4~3t- 4     ORXIGIN ANTI PnCGRIESS,more natuiral to supDose that God t;aught our
Iirst parewts only such language as suited thieir
present occasions; leaving them, as he did in
cither respects, to enlarge and itmprove it as
~their future necessities should requiire. Conse-quently, those rudi-Ments Of slwech must have
bee'n poor and itarrow; andi we are at liberty
lo iniquitre, in what manner, and by what steps,,
laDgi iage advan-ced to the state., in which we'now find it.
Shouild we -suppose! a!period -exi)tted, before
words were invented or known; it is evident,
that men could h ave no other me,tbod i)f coln'munictingtheir feelings, than'by the cries of
pmsSion, aecompanied by suc:h;motions and gesttires, as were farther expressive of emotion.
These indeed are theo only signs,, which nat.ure.
teachies all men, and whiche are ivriderstood by
-all. Ono, who saw another groingI into some
place, whe-re he himself h-ad been frighten~ed,
or exposed to danige'r, and w,h o wished to warn
Ihis neighbor of the danger, coulid contrive no
other methiod of doing it, than by uttering those
cries and making those gestures, which are the
signs of t-ear; as two men at this day would endcavor to make themselves, understood by- each
other, ilf thrown together on, a -desolate islamd,
ignorant of each other's language. Those exclamnations, therefiore, by grammarians c,alletl interjections, -uttered in a stronig and passionate
manner, were   undoubtedly the elements of
speech.
When inere e-nlarged communicatio-n became
requis-ite, and names began to be app'lied to objects; how can we suppose men proceeded in
t'kiseapplication- of naames, or irivention of words?OF LAhNGUAGE.             45
Certainly by imitating as much as they could,
the nature of the object named by the sound of
the namte given to it. As a painter, who would
represent grass, must employ a green color; so,
in the infancy of lanrguage, one giving a namJe to
anything harsh or boisterous, Would of course
employ a harsh or boisterous sound. He oould
not do otherwise, if he desired to excite in the
hearer the idea of that object, which he wished
to name. To imagine words invented, or names
given to things, without any ground or reason,
is to suppose an effect without a cause. There
must always have been some mnotive, which led
to one name, rather than anothler; and we can
suppose no metive, which would more generally operate upon men in their first efforts toward language, than a desire to paint by speech
the objects, which they named, in a manner
more or less complete, according as it was in
the power of the human voice to effect this imitation.
Wherever objects were to be named, intt
which sound, noise, or moti6n was concerned,
the imitation by words was suifliciently obvious.
Nothing was more natural, than to imitate by
the sound of the voice, the quality of the s-ound
or noise, which any external object pro'uced;
and to form its name accordingly. Thu% in all
Ianguages we discover a multitude of words,
which are evidently constructed on this principle. A certain bird is called the Cuckoo, from
the sounds which it emits. Whlen one sort of
wind is said to whistle., and another to roar; when
a serpent is said to hiss: a fly to butzz: and fallingtimber tocrash; when a stream is said to
flow, and hail to rattle; the resemblace be,ts6          ORIGIN AND PR1OCRESi
tween the word and tile thing signified is plainly discernible.  But in the names of objects
which address the sight only, where neither
noise nor motion is concerned; antid still more
in terms, appropriated to moral ideas, this analogy appears to fail. Yet many learned men
have imagined that,'hougch in such'cases it be.
comes more obscure, it is not altogether lost;
and that iR the radical words of all languages
there may be traced some degree of correspondence with the objects signifie3d.
This principle however of a natural relation
between words ant objects, can be applied to
language only in its most simple and early state.
Though in every tongue some remains of it may
be traced, it were utterly in vain to search for it
through the whole construction of any modern
language.  As terms increase in every nation,
and the vast field of language is filled up, words,
by a thousand faiilciftl and iiregular;nethods of
derivation  and composition,:'deviate  widely
from the primitive character of their roots,
and lose all resembhlance in sound of the things
signified. This is the present state of langawge.
Words, as we now use them, taken in general,
may be considered, as symbols, not imitations;
as arbitrary or instituted, not natural signs of
ideas. But there can be no doubt, that language, the nearer we approach to its rise
among men. will be found to partake more of a
natural expression.
Interjections, it has been shown, or passicnate exclamations, were the elements of speech.
Men labored to communicate their feelings to
each othc: by those exlreslive cries and ges.
-tates, which nature taught them. After wvord's,Or LANGUACGE.              47
or names of ohjects, began to be invented, this
modte of speaking by natural signs could not be
all at once disused. For language in its infancy
must have been extremely barren; and there
certainly was a period among all rude nations,
when conversation was carried on by a very
few words, intermixed with many exclamations
and earnest gestures. The small stock of words
which men then possessed, rendered those
helps entirely necessary jfor explaining their
conceptions; and rude uncultivated individuals,
not having always ready even the few words,
which they knew, would naturally labor to
make themselves understood by varying their
tones of voice, and by accompatnying their tone
with the most expressive gesticulations.
To this mode of speaking, r-ecessity gave rise.
But we must observe that, after this necessity
had in a great degree ceased, by language be.
coming in process of time more extensive and
copious, the ancient manner of speech still sub.
sisted among many nations; and, what had
arisen from necessity, continued to be used for
ornament. In the Greek and Roman languages,
a musical and gesticulating pronunciation was
retained in a very high degree. Without attending to this, we shall be at a loss in understanding several passages of the classics, which
relate to the public speaking and theatrical entertainments of theancietits. Our modern pronunciation wolld have seemed to them a lifeless
monotony. The declamation of their ora'tbrs
and the pronunciation of their actors upon the
stage approached to the nature of recitative in
music; was capable of being marked by notes,ADVERTISEMEW
BLAir's Lectures on Rhetorick need no commendation-they are extensively in use, which is sufficient
evidence of their merit and the high estimation in
which they are held. And to advocate the study of
Rhetorick is equally unnecessary, since it has already
become an important branch of education in the principal schools of our country. The object of this advertisement is therefore simply to apprise Teachbers
of the peculiarities of the present edition, and of the
editor's viewvs, in regard to the principle of instruction, on which it is prepared.
The design of ainnexing questions to the the te*
of elementary school books is to alleviate thie labor
of teachers, and to present to scholors in a peroeptible form, the tasks to which they are appointed. The
labor of proposing questions, at the time of recitation,
is by no means small to the teacher; and witlout
questions to which the attention can be directed,
when learning the lesson, there is no inconsiderable
difficulty, with young persons especially, in ascertaining the extent of what is required of them. But
while teachers and s4holars may be generally aided
in their respective duties, it is recomnmended to the
ormner, at thle time of recitation, to propose such other questions as may seem pertiuent; and, to the latter, noat tobe satisfied in becoming able to answer
those here given.
It is also suggested to teachers, ttiat their pupils
would find great advantage in fixing their mninds
more upon the ideas and less upon the words than is
usual-to answer as much as possible in their own
language, instead of committing to memory and repeating verbatim fromn the book. Words being arbitrary, arel retaived almost altogether by an effort
of mem ory; but in the re.tention of ideas, the memnotSRIGIN AND PROGRESS

ed men have proved.
With regard to gesture, the case was parallel;
fbr strong tones and animated gestures aLways
go together. The action both of orators and
players in Greece and Rome was far more vehenent than that to which we are accustomned.
To us. Roscius would appear a madman. Gesture was of such consequence on the ancient
stage, that there is reason for believing that on
some occasions the speaking and the acting were.
divided; ew~hich, according to our ideas, would
form a strange exhibition. One player spoke
the words in the proper tones, while another
expressed the corresponding motions and gestures. Cicero tells us, it was a contest between
him and Roscius, whether he could express a
sentiment in a greater variety of phrases, or
Roscius in a greater variety of intelligible significant gestures.  At last, gesture engrossed
the stage entirely; for under the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius, the favorite entertainment
of the public was the pantomime,which was erried on by gesticulation"'only.  The people
were moved, and wept at it as much as at tragedies; and the passion for it became so violent,
that laws were made for restraining the senad
tors from studying the pantomime art. Now,
though in declamations and theatrical exhibitions both tone and gesture were carried much
farther than in common discourse; yet public
speakitg of any kind must in every country bear
some proportion to the manner which is used in
*onversation; and such public entertainments
could never be relished by a nation whese tones
and gestures in discourse were as languid as ours.
48OF LANGUAGE.
T'he early language of men, being entirely
c-ompoffi(d of words descriptive of sensible objects, became of necessity extremely metaphoricali  For, to signify any desire or passion, or
-awy act of feeling of the mind, thley had no fixed
expression which was appropriated to that purpose; but were obliged to paint the emotion or
passion, which they felt, by alluding to those
sensible objects, which had most connection with
it, and which could renderit in some degree
visible to others.
But it was not necessity alone, that gave rise
to this pictured style. In the infancy of all,ocieties, fear and surprise, wonder and astonish.
ment, are the most frequent passions of men.
T'heir language will necessarily be affected by
this character of their minds. They will be dis.
posed to paint every thing in the strongest Colors. Even the manner, in which the first tribes
of men uttereil their words, had considerable
influence on their style. Wherever strong exclamations, tones, and gestures are connected
with conversation, the imaginatioin is always
more exercised; a greater effort of fancy and
passion is excited. Thus the fancy, being kept
awake and rendered more sprightly by this
mode of utterance, operates upon the style, and
gives it additional life and spirit.
As one proof, among many which might be
produced of the truth of these observations, we
shall transcribe a speech from Colden's History
of the Five Indian Nations, which was delivered by their chiefs, when entering on a treaty of
peace with us, in the following language. "We
are happy in having buried under ground the
red axe, that has so often been dyed in the blood

of our brethren. Now in this fort we inter the-,

and ours with its leaves! - Let us make fast its

strong stream run under the pit, to wash the evil
away out of our sight an'd remembrance. Thefire, that had long burned in Albany, is extinguished. The bloody bed is washed clean, and
the tears are wiped from our eyes. We now
renew the covenant chain of friendship. Let it
be kept bright and clean as silver, and not sufferred to contract any rust. Let not any one
pull away his arm from it."
As language in its progress grew morercopious, it gradually lost that figurative style, which
was its early char.acter. The vehement manner of speaking by tones and gestures became
less cotnmon.  Instead of poets, philosophers
became the instructors of men; and in their
reasoning on all subjects introduced that plainer
and more simple style of composition which we
now call prcse. Thus the ancient metaphorical
and poetical dress of language was at length
laid aside in the intercourse of men, and reserved
for those occasions oaly,. on which ornament was
professedly studied,QUE:STTIO'S.

RISE AND PROGRESS OF LANGUAGE~'AND OrP WVRiING.
WHEN we examine the (J'der in whichi
words are arranged in a sentence, we finid a
very remarkable difference between ancient
and moder-n tong'ues.  The consideration of
this will serve to uinfold farther the genius of
language, and to shew the cauises of those al-.terations, it has undeggone in the progress of
society
To conceive distinctly the nwature of this alteratioia, we mfust go back, as before~ to the
earliest period o-f language. Let us figure to
oujrselves a savage behol'iing some frutit which
he earnestly de-sires, anid re-quests another to
give him.    Suippose himn unacqnainted with
words, he wouild trihve to makIIe hithself undor-stood by pointingg eagerly at the object desired,
and ut-terinig at the same timie a passionate cry.
Supposing him to lhave acquiiredI words, the firs-t
wor(l which he would utter would be the iiame.
of' that object~ He would neo,t express himse.elf
ahccording t-o our Iorder of' construction, "vf3ive
rme fruit;". hut according to the Latifl. 6'rder,
"1 Fruit giv  m,   Fructun, da mihi," f9or this
pl~ain reason, that his attention wvas wholly directed toward tiruit, the object desired. Henice
we might concluide, a pri'ori, that this wvas th'e

is first presented to us the person who speaks,
"It is imposs_ible for me;"1 next, what the same-person is to-do,, ",to Passover in silence;" ard
-lastly, the object which excites him to aoti&amp;n,
"the' mildn-ess, clemnency, and moderation -of his
patron-"~ Cicero, from whiom these words are
translated, reverses this ord-er. n-e begins with
the object; places that first, which was the exciting ide'a in the speaker's mind, and ends with
t-he speaker a.nd his action. "1 Tantam mansue',

der is more anitnated; the English more clear
and distinct.
Otlr languace natulrally allowvs greater liberty
for transposition and irv.ersFion iri [poetry, thaul
inprose. Eventhere, howevers this liberty is
confined within narrow liimits, in comparison
with tie anrcient languages.  In this respct,
modern tongues vary fromn eachl other. 1TLhe
Italian approaches the nearest in its character
to the ancient transposition; the English has
more inversion than the rest; and the Frenci
bas the least of all.
Writing is an improvement upon speech, anind
consequently was posterior to it in ordter of
time. Its characters are of twvo kinds, sig'rns Cf,
things, and signs of wor(ds.  Thus the IpictUres,
hieroglyphics, and symbols, employed by the
ancients, were of the former sort; the alphabetical characters, now  employed by Europeans, of the latter.
Pictures were certainly the first attempt tnward writing. Malnkind in all ages and in ail
tations have been prone to imitation.'.'his
would soon be employed for describing andl recording events. Thus, to signitfy that one man
had kIilled another, they painted thle figure of
one man lying on the ground, and of ano)ther
standing by him with a hostile weapon in his
hand. When America was first discovered, this
was the only kiind of writing with which the
Mexicans were acquainted. It was however a
very imperfect mode of recording facts; sinces
by pictures external events only could be delineated;
Hieroglyphical characters may be considered
as the sesond stage of the art of writing. Thle:
54LW-NGUkAG.TA AND OF rWTTTING SC
consist of certain symbols, which are made te
stand for invisible objects on accounf of their
supposed resemblance to the object.s themselves.
Thus an eye represented kno-wledrge; and a circle, thaving neither beginning noir end, was the
symbol of eternity. Egypt was the -country
where this kind of wlritinrg was most studied,
and brought into a regular art. By these characte,rs all the boastedl wvisdorn of their priests
owas conveyed. ~ They pitched upon animals, to
be the emblems of mnoral objee,Ps, according to
the qualities with which they sepposed them to
be endued. Thus impradence was denominated by a fly; wisdom, by an ant; and victory,,
by a hawk. But this sort of writing was in the
highest degree enigmatical and confused; and
consequeDntly a very imperfect vehi-le -of knowl.
edge.
From  hieroglyphics some nations gradually
advanced to simple arbitrary marks, which stood
for objects, though without any resernblance of
the objects signified  Of this nature was the
writing of the Peruvians.'They used small
cords of different colors; and by knots upon
these, ofdifflerent sizes and variously ranged,
they invented signs for communicating their
thoughts to one another. The Chinese at this
day use written characters _of this nature.T'hey have no alphabet of letters or simple
sounds of which their words,re composed; but
every single character, which they use, is expressive of an idea; it is a mark, which signifies
some one thing or object.  The number of
these characters must consequently be immense.'They are said indeed to amount to seventy
fhousand.  To be perfectly acquainted with8~56       R 1S E7, A -1IT.7D PP. ESs OF
them is the business rf a whole life;  which
must have greatly retarded among ihem   the
progress ofevery kind of science.
It is evident thlat thie Chlnese characters,
like bieroglvphics, are signs of things and nQt
of words.  For we. ari- told, that the Japanese,
tile T'onquiiese. and the Coroens., who spea.k
different llnguages from each ltl)er, and friom
the inhabitants of XChinp, use, however, tile
same written characters iwith them, and thus
correspond intelligibly wit4 ppe Rnolter in writing, thouglh mutually ignor;ant of each other's
language,  Our arithmetical figures, 1, 2, $, 4,
&amp;c. are an example of this sorf of writng.--
They have no dependance on words; each igt
ure represents the number for which it stands  
aind consequently is. equally- understood by.atll
nations, who have agreed in the use of thes
figures.
The first step to remedy the imperfection,
the arrbiguity, and the tetliousness of each of
the methods of commsnlnication, which  have
been mentioned, was lthe invention of signs,
which should stand not directly for things, but
for words by wnich things wvere named and distinguisted. An alphabet of syllables seems to
have been invented previously to an aJ-phabet of
letters. Such an one is said to be ret;ined at
this day in Ethiopia and some countries in India.
*ut at best it must have been imperfect and inedffectual; since the n'umber of characters, being very considerable, must have rendered both
reading and writing very complex and laborious.

from some very old inscriptions, prevailed even
among the Greeks. They afterwvards used to
wvrite their lines alternately fr'om the right to
the left, and from the left to the right. The.

STRUCTURF, OF LANGUAGE.
THE common division of speech into eight
parts, nouns, pronouns, verbs, participles. ad.
verbs, prepositions, interjections, and conjuno.
tions,is not very accurate.since under the
general term of nouns it comprehends both substantives and adjectives, which are parts of
speech esset,tially distinct. Yet, as we are most
accustomed  to this division, and, as logical
exactness is not necessary to our present design,
we shall adopt these terms, which habit has

mar, and the most ancient part of speech.When men had advanced beyond simple interjections or exclamations of passion, and had begun to communicate their ideas to each other,,they would be obliged to assign names to objects, by which they were surrounded. Wherever a savage looked, he beheld forests and
trees. To distinguish each by a separate name
would have been endless.    Their conmmon
qualities, such as springing from a root, as4
bearing branches and leaves, would suggest a
general idea and a general name. The genius,'59do         STRUCTURE F' LAI'GUtAO'.
tree. was afterward subdivided into its several
species of oak, elm, ash, &amp;c. upon experience
and observation.
Still however only general terms were used
in speech. For oak, elm, and ash, were names
of whole classes of objects, each of which comprehen r'ed an immense number of unaistingnished indiviiduals. Thus, when the nouns, man, lion, or tree, were mentioned in conversation, it
could not, Jw known, which man, lion, or tree
was meant amcg the multitude comprebended
under one name. Hence arose a very useful
contrivance for determining the individual obcject
intended, hIy mean of that part of speech called
the article. In English, we have two articles, a
annd the; a is more general, the more definite.
The Greeks had but one, wlich agrees with our
definite article the. They supplied the place of
our article a by the absence of their article; thus,
ANrsTaoros signifies a man, o ANTuaROPOs, the man.
The Latins had no article; but in the room of it
used the pron4uns, hic, ille, iste. This, however, seems a defect in their language; since articles certainly contribute much to perspicuity
and precision.
To perceive the truth of this remark, observe the different imports of the following expressions: " The son of a King, the son of the
king, a son of the king's."  Each of these
three phrases has a separate meaning, too
obvious to be misunderstood. But, in Latin,
" filins regis" is entirely undetermined; it
may bear either of the three senses mentiened.s-fTM ACTORE OF LANGUAGE.  
Besides this quality of being dUfined by the
article, three affections belong to nouns, number,
gender and case, which deserve to be considered.
NNUMBER, as it makes a noun significant of one
or more, is singular or plural; -"' distinction
found in all tongues, which must have been co.
eval with the origin of language, since there
were few things, which men had more frequent
necessity of expressing, than the distinction between one and more. In the Hebrew, Greek,
and some other ancient languages, we find not
only a plural, but a dual number; the origin of
which may very naturally be accounted for, as
separate teims of numbering were yet undiscoved, and one, two, and many, were all, or at
least the principal numeral distinctions, which
men at first had any occasion to make.
GENDER, which is founded4 on the distinction
of the two sexes, can with propriety be applied
to the names of living creatures only. All other nouns ought to be ofthe neuter gender. Yet
in most languages the same distinction is applied to a great number of inanimate objects. Thus,
in the Latin tongue, ensis, a sword. is masculine;
saggita, an arrow, is feminine; and this assignation of sex to inanimate objects often appears
entirely capricious. In the Greek and Latin,
how,ever, all inanimate objects are not distributed into masculine and feminine; but many of
them are classed, Where all ought to be, under
the neuter gender; as sgaum, a iock; mare, the
sea  But in the French and Italian tongues, the
neuter gender is wholly unknown, all their
names of inanimate objects being put upon the
same footing with those of living creatures, and
F62        STRU6TU1S OP- LANGtUGt!.
distributed without reserve into masculine and
feminine. In the English language, all nouns,
literally used, that are not names of living creatures, are neuter; and ours is, perhaps, the only
tongue, except the Chinese, which is said to rQsemble. it jn this particular, in Which the dis.
tinction of gender is philosophically applied.
CAsE denotes the state or relation, which one
object bears to another, by some variation of
the name of that object; generally in the final
letters, and by some languages in the initial.
All tongues, however, do not agree in this mode
of expression. Declension is used by the Greek
and Latin; but in the English, French, and italiain, it is not found; or, at most, it exists in a
very imperfect state. These languages express
the relations of objects by prepositions, which
are the names of those relations prefixed to the
names of objects. English nouns have no case,
except a sort of genitive, commonly formed by
adding the letters to the noun; as when we say
"6Pope's Dunciad," meaning the Dunciad of Pope.
Whether the moderns have given beautr or
utility to language, by the abolition of cases, may
perhaps be doubted.  They have, however,
certainly rendered it more simple, by removing
that intricacy which arose from different forms
of declension, and from the irregularities of the
several declensions. But in obtaining this simplioity, it must be confessed, we have filled language with a multitude of those little words,
called prepositions, which, by perpetually occurring in every sentence, encumber speech;
and by rendering it more prolix, enervate its
force. The sound of modern language is also
less agreeable to the ear, being deprived of that4tWESTIO~S.             e
vairiety, and sweetness, which arose from the
length o'f words and the change of terminations,_
4occasioned by, cases in the Greek and Latin'.
But perhap s the greatest disadvantage we su'stai4 by the -abolition of cases is the loss of t,hat
liberty of tran'sposition in the arrangement of,
words, whichi the ancient lantguages enjoyed.
PRoNouNS are the representatives of nouns,
and are" subject to the samne modifications of
number, genader a'nd case. We may obee,

The tenses were contrivefd to mark the *several distinctions of time. We comrmonly think
of no more than its three great divisions, the
past, the presont, and the future; and we might
suppose that if verbs had been so contrived as
merely to express these, no more was necessary.
But language prboceeds with much greater sub.tility. It divides time into its several moments;
it regards itas never standing still, but always
flowing; things past, as more or less distant;
and things future, as more or less remote by
different gradations.  Henct the variety of
tenses in almost every la;nguage.
The present may indeed'be always regarded
as one indivisible point, which admits no variety;
" I am," " svm."  Blt' it is not so with the past.
Even the poorest language has two or three
tenses to express its varieties. Ours has fi,ur.
1. A past action may be represented as unfinish.
ed, by the imperfect tense; "I was walking,
amnbulabam."  2. A,s finished by the perfect
tense;'" I have walked."  3. As finished some
time since, the particular time being lit unde.
termined; "1I walked, ambulavi;" that is what
grammarians call an aorist or indefinite past. 4.
As finished before something else, which is also
past. This is the plusquamperfect;'1 had
walked, ambulaveram.   I had walked before
you called upon me."  Our language, we must
perceive with pleasure, has an advantage over
the Latin, which has only three variations of
past time.
The varieties in future time are two; a simple or iudefinite future; "I shallwalk, amnbula.
bo;" and a future, having reference to something else, which is likewise future; "I shall
F2
65-"6        STnzCTUR OF' L:w1aNGVL
have walked, ambulavero; I shall have wal;ked,
before he will pay me a visit."
Besidos tenses, verbs admit the distinction of
voices, viz. the active and,passivRe; as, ":I love,
or I am loved."  They admit also the distinction of modes, which are int:nded to express the
perceptions and,volitions of the mind under different foxrms. The indicati}ve. mode simply declares a proposition; "1; write.; I have writ.
ten."  The imperative requires, commands, or
threatens; "Write thou,; let him write."  The
subjunctive expresses a proposition under the
i-rm. of a condition, or as subordinate.to somrething, to which reference is made.; "I migirt
write; I cuuld write;: should write, if the
matter were so"' This expression,of the perceptions and volitions of the mind in so many various forms, together with the distinction of the
three persons, 1, thou, and he, constitutes the
conjugation of-verbs, which makes so great a
part of the grammar of all languages,
Conjugation is reckoned most perfect in those
languages, whinch, by varying (he termination or
the initial syllable of the -verb, expresses the
greatest number of important.circumstances
without the help of auxiliary verbs. In the
oriertal tongues verbs have few tenses; but
their modes are so contrived, as to express a
great variety of circumstances and relations. In
the Hebrew, they say In one word, without tle
aid of an auxiliary, not only,'"1 taught," but,
"I was taught; I caused to teach; I was ca-used to teach; 1 taught myself." The Greek,
which is commonly thought to be the most perfect,of all languages, is very regular and completein the mnodes anl tenses.'Wheo LatisaEi-LISHITONGU~E.
though formed on the same model, is not so
perfect; particularly in the passive voice,
which forms most of the tenses by the aid of the
auxiliary "sum." In modern European tongues,
conjugation is.very defective. The twe great
auxiliary verbs, to -have, -aBd to be, with those
other auxiliaries, which we use in Etnglish, do,
shall, will, may, and can, prefixed'to a participle,
or to another verb in the iifinitive mode, supersede.in a,great measure'the different terminations of modes and tenses which formed the antient conjugations.
The other parts,of speech, as -they admit no
variation, will require only a short discussion.
Adverbs are for the most -part an abridged
mode of speech, e~xpressing by one word, what
might by a circumlocution be resolved into two
or more words, belonging to other parts of
speech.."Here," for instance, is the same with'in this place."  Hence adverbs seem  to be
less necessary, and of iater introduction into
speech, than several other classes of words;
and accordingly most of them are derived from
other words,.formerly established in the language.
Prepositions and conjunctions serve to express the relations which things bear to one another, their mutual influence, dependence, and
coherence; and so to join words together, as to
form intelligible  propositions.  Conjunctions
are commonly employed for connecting sentences, or members;of sentences; as, ond because, and the like.  Prepositions are used for
connecting words; as, of, from, to, &amp;c. The

7INTRODUCTI!N.
A PROpERa acquaintance with the circle of liberal
-arts is requisite to the study of Rhetorick and Beqlles
Lettres. To extend the knowledge of tlhem must be
the $rst care of those who wish either to write with
reputation, or so to express themselves in public as to
-conmmand attention. Among the ancients it wvs an
essential principle, that the orator ought to be con*
versant in every department of learning. No art iadeed can be contri.ve'd which can stamp merit on a
composition, rich or splendid in expression, but bar.
ren or erroneous in sentimont.  Oratory, it is true,
has often been d;:graced by attempts to establish a
false criterion of its value. Writers have endeavored to supply want of matter by gracesof composition;
and courted the temporary applaquse of the igpnorant
instead of the lasting approbation of theliscening.
But such imposture must be short and transitory.
The body and substance of any valuable composition
must be frrmed of knowledge and science. Rthetorick
completes the structure, and adds the polish; but
firm and solid bodies only are able to receive it,
Among the learned it has long bqen a contested,
and remains still an undecided question, whether nature or art contributQ most toward excellence in
writing and discourse. Various mnay be the opinions
with respect to the manner, in which art can nmost
effectually furnish aid for such a purpoe; and it
were presumption to assert, that rhetor cal rulo,
howjust soever, are sufficient to form an orator.
Private application and study, sppposing natural genius o be favorable, are certainly superior to any sys.

tions, prepositions, and those relative pronouns,
which serve the same purpose of connecting
different parts of discourse.
Having-thus briefly considered the structur&amp;
of language in general, we will now enter more
particularly into an examination of our own labn
guage.
I'he English, which was spoken after the
Normanconquest, and sontinues to be spoken
now, is a mixture of the ancient Saxon and the
Norman French, together with such new and
foreign words, as commerce and learning have,
in a succession of ages, graduaJly introduced.
From the influx of so many streams, from a
junction of so many dissimrilar parts, it naturally
follows, that the English, like every compounded language, must be somewhat irregular. We
cannot expect from it that complete analogy in
structure, which may be found in those simpler
languages, which were formed within them.
selves, and on built one foundation. Hence our
syntax is short, since there are few marks in the
words themselves which show their relation to
each other, or point out either their concord.
ance or their government in a sentence.  But,
if these be disadvantages in a compound lauguage, they are balanced by the advantages
which attend it, particularly by the number and
variety of words by which such a language is
commonly enriched. Few languages are more
copious than the English.  In all, grave subjects especially, historical, critical, political, and
moral, no complaint can justly be made of the
barrenness of our tongue. We are rich too in
the language of poetry; our poetical style difw
fars widely from prose, aot withrespect to numE GLUSi TO5-G~U.  
14ers only, buit in the very words themselves;
which,proves, what a compass and variety of
words we can select, aM employ, suited to different occasions.  Herein we are infinitely
supe-rior -to the French, whose. poeticalI langUage, if-i were not distinguished ty rhyme,
would not be kr0own to differ from their ordina'
ry prose. Their language, however, surpasses
osrs in expressing whate:ver is deligate, gay, and
amusing..Jt is perhaps, the happiest language
obr con,versation in the known world; but for
the higher subjects of compqsition, the Esglish
is justl.y considered as far superior to it.
The flexibility of a language, or its -power of
lbecoming either grave and strong, or easy and
fiowing, or tender and( gentle, or -pompous and
magnificent, as oceasions require, is a quality of
great importance,in speaking and writing. This
depends on tle copiousness of a -language; the
different arrangements of which its words are
susceptible; and the variety and beauty of the
sounds of its wQrds, The -Greek:ossessed
these requisites in a hEgher degree than anjr
otherJanguage. It,euperadded the graceful variety of its different dialects; and thereby -readily assumed every,kind of character, an author
could wish,-fr-om the most si ple and -tamiliar,
tothe most majestic. The Latin, -though very
benautiful, is inferi(r in this respect to the Greek.
It has more ef.a fixet character of stateliness
and gravity; and is supported by a certain senatorial dignity, of-whic;h it is diflicult for a writer
to divest it. Among modern tongues the ltaliag
possesses much more flexibility than the French;
and seems to be on the whole the most perfect

of tre ruins of the arcient.  Our lanuguage,
though  unequal to the.tali.r.:in  lexibiLity, is not destitute --of aconsiderable degree
of:This quality.  i Whoe-Eer considers the diversity ofatyle in some of our best writers, will aiscover in our tongue such a circle of expre.sionv
such a power of"'toraommodation  the variouM
tastes of men, os redounds ineh't*% i4btcer.
Our langnage has beaen thought to be very
deficient in harmony of sound.: yet the melddy
of its versification, its power of isupportingp6etical numbers, without the assistance of rhyme,
is a sufficient proof, that it is far from  being uwharmonious. Even the hissing sound, of which
it has been accused, occurs less frequently than
has been suspected. For in many words, and
in the final syllables4especially, the letter s has
the sound of z, which is one of the sounds on
which the ear rests with pleasure; as' in has,
these, loeaes, hears, &amp;c.
It must however. be admitted, that smoothness is not the distinguishing property'of the
English tongue. Strength and expressivenees,
rather than grace and melody, constitute its
character. It possesses also the property of be
ing the most simple of all the European dialects
in its form and construction. It-is free from the
intricacy of cases, declensions, modes and tenses. Its words'are subject to fewer variations
kfrom their original form, than thoseof any other
language. Its nouns have no. distinction ofgender, except what is made by, n'ature; and but
ene variation in case.'Its adjectives admit no
change, except what expresses the degree of
comparison. Its verbs, instead of the varieties
f ancient conjugation, admit only of four or five
70thtiagessin termrintiton. A few prepositions and
auxiliary verbs ieffet all the purposes of significancy; while the principal words for' the most
part preserve their form unaltered.  Hence
our language acquires a simplicity and facility,
which are the cause of its being frequently writ.
ten and spoken with inaccuracy. We imagine
that a competent ski'll in it may be acquired
without any study; and that in a syntax so narrow and limited as ours; there is nothing wiich
requires attention. But the fundamental rules
of syntax are coilmon to tile English and to the
ancient tongues; and regard to them is absolutely requisite for writing or speaking with
propriety.
Whatever be the advantages or defects of our
language, it certainly deserves, in the highest
degree, our study and attention. The Greeks
and Rornans, in the meridian of their glory, be.
stowed the highest cultivation on their respective languages. The French and Italians'have
employed much study upon theirs; and their
example is worthy of imitation. For whatever
knowledge may be gained by the study of other
languages, it;can never be communicated with
advintage, unless by those, who can write and
speak their own language with propriety. Let
the matter of an author be ever so good, and
useful, his compositions will always suffer in the
public esteem, if his expression be deficient iin
purity or propriety. At the same time, the a:xttainment ofa correct and elegant style is an 6b6
ject which demands application and labor. if
any one suppose he can catch it nierely by the
ear, or acquire it by a hasty perusal of some of
our good authors, he will be much disappointed.

STYLE, PERSPICUITY AND PRECISION.
STYLE is the peculiar manner in which a
tnan expresses his thoughts by words. It is a
picture of the ideas in his mind, and of the order in which they there exist.
The qualities of a good style may be ranged
under two heads, perspicuity and ornament. It
wvill readily be admitted, that perspicuity is the
fundarental quality of a good style. Without
this the brightest ornaments only glimmner
through the Bark, and perplex instead of pleasing the reader. If we be forced to follow a
writer with much care; to pause, and to read
over his sentences a second time, in order to understand them fully, he will not please us long.
Men are too indolent to relisha so much labor.
Though they may pretend to admire an author's depth, after they have discovered his
meaning, they will seldom be inclined to look a
secicnd time into his book.
Perspicuity requires attention. first to single
words and phrases, and then to the construction of sentences. When consideredl with respect to words and phrases, it requires these
three qualities, purity, propriety and precision.
Purity and propriety of language are often
used indiscriminately for each other; and inl

ideas, may be faulty in three respects. They

f hr means, but so me others which are only Tre
rated; or they. may express those ideas, but not
completely; or theyv may express them together with something more than-he intends. Pres
Cision is'opposed to these: three faults; but particularly-to the last, into wlhich feeble writers
are very apt to fall. They employ a multitude
of wards, to make themselves understood, as
they' think, more distinctly; but they only-confound the reader. The image, as they place it
before you, is always seen double. When -an
author' tells us of his hero's'crurage, in the day
of battle; the expression; is premisej and we
uinderstand it Tfully. But if, from a Adesive of
multiplying words,'he praise his;courage -and
fortite; at the memet-he' joins -these words
together, our idea begins to waver. He intends
to express one quality more strongly; but -he
is in fact expressing two. Courage resists danger,jfortitude supports pain. The occasions of
exerting these qualities are different; and, being led to think of both together, when only
one of them should engage attention, our view
is rendered unsteady, add our conception of the

Surprised, astonished, amazed, confounded.
We are surprised at what is new or unexpected;
we are astonished at what is vast or great; we
are amazed at what is incomprehensible; we
are confounded by what is shocking or. terrible.
Pride, vanity. Pride makes us esteem ourselves; vanity makes us desire the esteem  of
others.
Haughtinesw, disdain.  Haughtiness is founded on a high opinion of ourselves; disdain, on
a low opinion of others.
To weary, to fatigue.  Continuance of the
same thing wearies us; labour fatigues us. A
man is wearied by standing; he is fatigued by
walking.
To abhor, to detest. To abhor imports simply
strong dislike; to detest imports likewise strong
disapprobation.  We abhor being debt; we
detest treashery.
To invent, to discover.  We invent things
which are new; we discover what is hidden.
Galilamo invented the telescope; Harvey discovered the circulation of the blood.
Entire, complete. A thing is entire, when it
wants none of its parts; complete, when it
wants none of the appendages which belong to
it.  A man may occupy an entire house  
though he may not have one complete apart.

our attention to it.  For, whatever be the subject, if the sentences be constracted in a clumsy, perplexed, or feeble manner, the work cannot be read with pleasure, nor even with profit.
But by attention to the rules which relate to
this part of style, we acquire the habit of ex-,pressing ourselves with perspicuity and elegance; and if a disorder happen to arise in
some of our sentences, we immediately see
where it lies, and are able to rectify it.
The properties most essential to a perfect
sentence are the four following. 1. Clearness.
2. Unity. 3. Strength. 4. Harmony.
Ambiguity is opposed to clearness, and arises
from two c,ases; either from a wrong choice
of words, or a wrong collocation of them. Of
the choice of words, as far as regards perspicuity, we have already sp'oken. Of the colloca.
tion of them, we are now to treat. From the
nature of our language, a capital -rule in the
arrangement of our sentences is, that words or
members most nearly related should ble placed
as near to each other as possible, tiat their miltual relation may clearly appear.. This rule
is frequently neglected even -by. good write'rs.
A few instances will show both, its importance
and application.
In the position of adverbs, which are used
toqualify the significatiboi of something which
either precedes or follows them, a good deal of
nicety is to be observed.  "By greatness,"
says Addison,'" I do not only' mean the bulk of
any single object, but' te largeness of a whole
View."'  Here the place of the adverb only
makes it limit the verb mean.,'I do not onlySTRUCTURE OF SENTENCES.
mean."I  The question may then be asked,
What does he more than mean? Hiad it been
placed after bulk, still it would have been
wrong; for it might then be asked, What is
meant beside the bulk..? Is it the color, or any
otherproperty? Its proper place is after the
word object: " By greatness, I do not mean
the bulk of any single object only;1' for then,
when itis asked,, What does he mean more
than the bulk of a single object? the answer
comes out precisely as the author intends,' the
largeness of a whole views."' Theism," says
Lord Shaftesbury, " can ouly be opposed to polytheism or atheism." It rnay be asked tCen,
Is theism capable of nothing else, except being
opposed to polytheism  or atheism?  This is
what the words literally mean, through the irnmproper collocation of only  I He ought to have
said, " Theism can be opposed only to polytheism or atheism." Inaccuracies of this kind occasion little ambiguity in common discotrse, because the tone and emphasis usei by the speaker generally make the meaning perspicuous,
But in writing, where a person speaks to the
eye, he ought to be more accurate, anrid:so to
connect.adverbs with the words they qualify,
that hin meaning carnot. be nmistaken on the first
inspection.
When a circurQstance is interposed in the
middle of a sentence,e it sometimes requii'es at.
tention to place it in such inmainer as t?) diveSt it
of all ambiguity. For instance-, "1 Are tiese designs," says Lord Bolingbroke, "which: any
man who is born a Briton, in any circumstances,
in any situation, ought to be ashamed or aft'aid06         STPTRUCTURE OF SENTENCES.
to avow'?" Here we are in doubt whether the
phrases, " in any circumstances, inmany situation,"
be connected with "a man born a Britol," or
with that man's " avowing his designs." if the
latter, as seems most likely was intended
to be the meaning, the arrangement *ught to
be this'; "Are these designs which any man who
is born a Briton ought to be ashamed or afraid,
in any circumstances, in any situation, to avow?"
Still more attention is requisite to a proper
disposition of the relative pronouns who, whivh,
what, whose,; and of all those particles which
express the connexion of the parts of speech.
As all reasoning depends upon this connexion,
we canaot bie-too accurate with regard to it. A
small error may   obscure the meaning of a
whole sentence; and even where the meaning
is apparent, yet if these relatives be misplaced,
we always find something awkward and disjointed in the structure of the period. ~ The following passage in;Bishop Sherlock's Sermons will
exemplify these observations;-s'4t is'folly to
pretend to arm ourselves against the accidents
of life, by heaping up treasures which nothing
can protect us against, but the good providence
of our heavenly Father."--TWhich grammatically refers to the immediate,ly preceding noun,
wvhich here is " treasures;" and this woald'convert the vholeperiod into no,ssnse. The sentence -should have beron th-t, constructed: "-"It
is folly to pretendl, by heaping up treasures, to
a:rm ourselves against the - accidents of life, against which nothing can protect us, but the
good providence of our heavenly Father."
We noi proceed to the second quality of aSTRUCTvURE OF SE?NTENCES.
well arranged sentence, which we termed its
Unity. _This is a capital property. The very
nature of a sentence implies one proposition to
be expressed.  It may consist of parts; but
these parts must be so closely bound together
as to make an impression of one object only
upon the mind.
To preserve this unity, we must first observe,
that during the course of the sentence the subject should be changed as little as possible.
There is generally in every sentence some per.
son or thing which is the governing word.
This should be continued so, if possible, from
the beginning to the end of it. Should a man
express himself in this manner--" After we
came to anchor, they put me on shore, where I
was saluted by all my triends, who received me
with the greatest kindness"'-though the objects
in this sentence are sufficiently connected, yet
by shifting so often the subject and person, we,
they, I, and who, they appear in so disunited a
view, that the sense and connexion are nearly
lost. The sentence is restored to its proper
unity by constructing- it thus: " Hlaving come to
anchor, I was put on shore, where I was saluted by all my friends, who re'eived me with the
greatest kindness."'
The second rule is, never crowd into one
sentence ideas which have so little connexion,
that they miaght well be divided into two or
more sentences, Violation of this rule, never
fails to displease a reader. Its effect, indeed, is
so disgusting, that of the two, it is the safest
extreme to err rather by too many short sentences, than by one that is overloaded and cea81STWUCTURtE OF SENTaN'Cs.
fused. The following sentence from a traMnsla
tion of Plutarch will justify this opinion-:
"; Their march,"' says the author, speaking o-f
the Greeks, " was through  an uncultivated
country, whose savage inhabitants fared hardly,
havingno ether riches than a breed of lean
sheep, whose flesh was rank and unsavory, by
reason of their continual feeding upon sea fish."
Here the subject is repeatedly changed. The
march of the'Greeks, the description of the
inhabitants through whose country they passed,
the account of their sheep, and: the reason of
their sheep being disagreeable food, make a
jumble of objects, slightly related to each other,
which the reader cannot wit.iout considerable
difficulty comprehendin one view.
The,third rule for preserving the,unity of a
sentence is, keep clear of parentheses in the
middle of it. These may on some occasions
have a spirited appearance, as prompted by a
certain vivacity of thought, which-can glance
happily aside, as it is going along. But in general their effect is extremely bad; being a perplexed method of disposing of some thought,
which a writer has not art enough to introduce
in its proper place. It is needless to produce
any instances, as they occur so frequently among-incot'rect writers.
Tihe fourth rule for the unity of a sentence
is, bring it to a full and perfect close. lIt needs
n.ot to be obse rved, that an unfinished sentence
is na sentence as it respects grammar. Butr
sentences often occur, which are more than finished. When we have arrived at what we expected to be the conclusion; when -we -arceme to the word on which the mind is naturally led to rest; unexpectedly some circumstance is added; which ought to liave been omitted, or disposed: of elsewhere. Thns, for in,
stance, in the following sentence fiome Sir William Temple, the adjection to the sentence is
entirely foreign to it. Spealiing of Btlrnet's
Theory of the Earth, and Fontenelle's Plurali.
ty of WVorlds  "The fiirst,"'says he, "'could,

censure of the old poetry, and preference of
the new, thaltI could not read either of these
strains  without some indignation; whi"ch no
qnality among men is so apt to raise in me as

concludes the sentence; for the last' member
is added after the proper close.

QURST;ON1,134       STRUCTURE eF SENTENCES.
STRUCTURE       OF SENTENCES.
WE now proceed to the third quality of a
correct sentence, which we termed strength.
By this is meant such a disposition of the several words and members, as will exhibit the
sense to the best advantage; as will render the
impression, which the period is intended to
make, most full and complete; and give every
word and member its due weight and force.
To the production of this effect, perspicuity and
unity are absolutely necessary; but more is re.
quisite. For a sentence may be clear; it may
also be compact, or have'he requisite unity;
and yet, by some unfavorable circumstance in
the structure, it may fail in that strength or
liveliness of impression, which a more happy
collocation would produce.
The first rule for promotingl the strength of
a sentence is, take from it all redundant words.
Whatever can be easily supplied in the mind,
is better ornitted in the expression; thus, " content with deserving a triumph, he refused the
honor of it," is better than " being con-tent with
deserving a triumph, he refused the honor of
it." It is one of the most useful exercises on
reviewing what we have written, to contract
that circuitous mode of expression, and' to cut
off those useless excrescences, which are usually found in a first draught. But we must te
cautious of prunirg so closely as to give a hardness and dryneess to the style.  Some leaves
must be left to shelter and adorn the fruit.
As sentences should be cleared of superflusus words, so alSO of superfllous membersOpposed to this, is the fault we frequentlySTRUCTURE OF SEN'TENCEs.     85
meet, the last memnber cf a period being
only a repetition of the former in a different dress. For example, speaking of beauty,
" the very first discovery of it?" says Addison,
"strikes the mind with i,!Puard joy, and spreads
delight through all its faculties."  In this instance, scarcely any thing is added by the secondmember of'the sentence to what was expressed in the first. Though the flowing style
of Addison may palliate such negligence; yet
it is generally true, that language, divested of
this prolixity, is more strong and beautiful.
The second rule for promoting the strength
of a sentence is, pay particular attention to the
use of copulatives, relatives, and particles, employed for transition and connection. Some
observations on this subject, which appear useful, shall be mentione,.
What is termed splitting of particles, or separating a preposition from the noun, which it
governs, is ever to be avoided. For example,
"' though virtue borrows no assistance from, yet
it may often be accompanied by, the advantages
of fortune.' In such instances we suffer pain
from the violent separation of two things, which
by nature are closely united.
The strength of a sentence is much injured
by an unnecessary multiplication of relative
and demonstrative particles. If a writer say,'i there is nothing which disgusts me sooner,
than the empty po~mp of language;" he expresses himself less forcibly, than if he had
said, nothing disgusts me sooner, than the empty pomp of language."  The formrer mode of
expression in the introduction ef a subject, or

in laying down a proposition, to which p~artlcnular attentioni is demanded, is very proper; but
in ordinary discourses the latter is- far preferable.
With. regard. to the relative, we shall. only

onf a- serious or dignified kind, -it, should constantly, be insgerted.
On tile copulative particle and, w-hich occurs'o of'ten, several observations tire to be made,,
It is evident, that an unnecessary- repetition of
it enfeebles style.  By omitting it we often
make a closer connection, a quicker smccessieu
ofT obj-ects, than when it is in-serted betweera
th em a," Venii, vidli, vici,"l expressis with mtorespirit the rn;)idity of caniquest, than if connecV.&gt;
ing particles had been used. When, however.
we wishi to pr-event- a quick, transition~ from vnf.1
object to another; and when enumerating obj,ects -which we wish. to appear as distinct fromt
each other as possible;. copulatives m-ay be
multiplied  with peculiar advantage.  Thwa
Lord BoliDgbroke s'ays with propriety,.."such aman. might fi311 a victim to power;. but, teutb.,
andl reason, and liberty., would fall wi th, him."
The third ruile- for prom-oting th-e strength of
a. senttence is,.dispose of' the principal word or
words in that part, of the sentence, where they
will make the most strikijng impres,Ision. Perspicuity ought first to be studied; and the nature of our language allows no great liberty of
collocation.  Int genieral, the important. words!
are placed at the begzinning of a. senteDc&amp;
Thus Mr. Add-is-o; "the pleasures'of the ii-~STRUCTURE OF SENTENCES.
agiation, taken in their full extent, are not so
gross as those of sense; nor so refined as tbose
of the understanding."  This order seems to be
the most plain and natural. Sometimes, however, when wve propose giving weiefght to a sentence, it is useful to suspend the meaning a lit-'ile, and then to bring, it out fully at the close.
"6 Thus," says Pope, "on whatever side we
contemplate Homerr, what principally strikes
us, is his wonderful invention."
The fourth rule for promoting the strength
of sentences is, make the members of them go
sn. rising in their importance one above another. This kind of arrangement is called a climnax, and is e-ver regarded, as a beauty in composition.  Why it pleases is sufficiently evident. In all things we love to advance to what
is more and more beautiful, rather than to follow a retrograde order. IHaving viewed soIme
considerable object, we cannot without pain de.
scend to an infterior circumstance.  " Cavendun
~st,' says quintillian, " ne decrescat oratio, etfortior sub,jungabzLtur Cliquid infirnmius." A weaker assertion should never follow a stronger one;
and, when a sentence consists of two members,
the longest should in general be the concluding
one.   Periods, thus divided, are pronounced
more easil3; and the shortest member beint
-placed first, we carry it more readily in our
memory, as we proceed to the second, and see
the connection of' the two nmore clearly.  Thus
to say,"' When our passions have forsaken us,
we flatter ourselves with the belief that we
have forsatken them,': is both more graceful and
more perspicuous, than to begin with the IQoABRIDGEBD.
TASTE.
TASTE is "the power of receiving pleas.
p~re Ier pain from the beauties or deformitiesl of
vature and of art." It is aI faculty common ira
szome degree to nil men.-~Through thie circle of
hlum'an nature, nothing is more general than the
relish of beauty o'f one kinad or other; of what
is -ordlerly popotioned, grand, harmonious,
neiv,dr sprightly. Nor does there prevail less
generally a di'srelish of whatever is g-ross, disp)rop-nrtioned, disorderly  or discordant.  In
chiildren, the rudiments of taste appear very
early in a thousand inst.anoes; in their partiality,
f6r reaular bodies, their fondness for pictures
and statues, and their warm' attachment to whatever lis new or astonishing. T he most stupid
peasants rece%ive pleasure from tale-s and ballads,.
an'd are delighted w iLh beautiful appearances
of nature -in the ea'rth and heavens. Even in
the deserts of America,'where human' nature
appears in its mo'st uncultivated state,the savagOs3
have their ornaments of dr'e~s, their wnxr and
their death songs, their. harangues and their orators. The principles of kaste, most therefore

have some discearnment of beauty is voeo es*t'I        ISTRUCTURE OF SENTEENGES.
gest part of the proposition; "We flatter ourselves with the belief that we have forsaken
our passions, when they hlave forsaken us."'
The fifth rule for constructing sentences with
strength is, avoid concluding them with an adverb, a preposition, or any insignificant word.
By such conclusions, style is always wvealkenedl
and degraded.  Sometimes, indeed, where the
stress and significancy rest chiefly upon words
of this kind, they ought to have the principal
place allotted them. No fault, for example,
can bet found with this sentence of Bolingbroke; " In their prosperity my friends shall
never hear of me; in their adversity, always;"
where ne,,er and alway.s, being epipnatical
words, are so placed, as to make a strong impression. But, when these inferior parts of
speech are introduced, as circumstances, or as
qualifications of' more important words, they
shouli always be disposed of in the least conspicuous parts of the period.
We should always avoid concluding a sentence or memher.with any of those particles,
vhich distinguish the cases of nouns; as of, to,./rorn, witit, by. Thus it is much better to say,'; avarice is a crime, of whEich wise menr are often guilty," than to say, avarice is a crime,
which wise men are often guilty of."  This is
a phrascology which all correct writers shun.
A cormplex verb, compounded of a simple verb
and a subseqaent preposition, is also an ungracefiul conclusion of a period; as, bring about,
cl'ar up, give over, and manv others of thie sanne
kind; instead of which, if a simple verb be
employed, it will terminate the sentence withSTRUCTURE OF SENTENCES.
mrnore strength. Even the pronoun it, especiatly when joined with some of the prepositions,
as with it, in it, to it, cannot without violation of
grace be the conclusion of a sentence.  Any
phrase, which expresses a circumstance only,
cannot conclue e a sentence without great inelegafice. Circumstances, indeed, are like unshapely stones in a building, which try the skill
of an artist, where to place them with the least
offence. We should not crowd too many of
them together; but rather intersperse them in
Aifferent parts of the sentence, joined with the
principal words on which they depend. Thus,
for instance, when Dean Swift says, " what I
had the honor of mentioning to your lordship
some time ago in conversation, was not a new
thought;" these two circumstances, sore tinme,ago, and in conv,ersation, which are joined,
would have been better separated thus; "what
I had the honor some time ago of mentioning to
your lordship in conversation."
The sixth and last rule concerning the
strength of a sentence is this, in the members
of it, where two things are compared or contrasted; where either resemblance or opposition is to be expressed; some resemblance in
the language and construction ought to be observed. The following passage from Pope's
prefaceto his Homer, beautifully exemplifies
this rule. " Homer was the greater genius;
Virgil the better artist: in the one we admire
the man; in the other, the work. Homer hurries us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil
leads us with an attractive majesty. Homer
scatters with a generous profusion; Virgil bestowvs with a careful magnificence. Iomer, like

STRUCTURE       OF    S-ENTENCE..,HAR5MONY.
HAVING considered sentences with regard
to their meaning, under the heads of Perspicuity, Unity, and Strength, we shall now consider
them with respect to their sound.
In the harmony of periods, two things are lo
be considered. First, agreeable sound or modu1ation ingeneral, without any particular expression. Next, the sound so ordered as to becrme expressive of the sense. Tihe first is the
more common    the second the superior beauThe beauty of musical construction depends
upon the choice and arrangement of words.
Those words are most pleasing to the ear,
which are composed of smooth and liquid
sounds, in which there is a proper intermixture
of vowels and consonants, without too many
harsh consonants, or too many open vowels in
succession. Long words are generally more
pleasing to the ear than monosyllables; and
those are the most musical, which aire not wholly
composed of long or short.syllables, but of an
intermixture of them; such as delight, amuse,
velocity, celerity, beautiful, impetuosity.  If thle
words, however, which compose a sentence, be
ever so well chosen and harmonious, yet, if
they be unskilfully arranged, its music is entirely lost. As an instance of a musical sentence,
we may take the following, from Milton: " We
shall coiduct you to a hill side, laborious, in.
deed, at the first ascent; but else, so smooth, so92                3HARCINONY.
green, so full of goodly prospects and melodious sounds on every side, that the harp of Orpheus was not more charming.?' Every thing
in this sentence conspires to render it harmonious. Tlhe words are well chosen; laborious,
smooth, green, goodly, melodious, charming; and
so happily  arranged, that no alteration can
be madle without injuring the melody.
There are twvo things on wvhich the music of
a sentence principally (lepends; ttiese are, the
proper distribution ot the several members of
it, and the close or cadence of'the whole.
First, the distributi:Un of the several members should be carefully regarded. Whatever
is easy to the organs of speech is always grateful to the ear.  While a period advances, the
termination ofr each member forms a pause in
the pronunciation; and these pauses should be
so distributed, as to bear a certain musical proportion to each other. This will be best illustrated by examples.'" This discourse concern.

of tht first entrance upon a religious course;
except only in those personrs who have had the
happiness to be tratined up to religion by the easy and insensible degrees of a pious and virtuous education." This sentence is far from be.
ing harmonious; owing chiefly to this, that
there is but one pause in it, by which it is dinrided into two members, each of which is solong
as to require a considerable stretch of breath in
pronouncing it. On the contrary, let us observe the grace of the following passage f'orn
Sir Williamn Temple, in which he speaks sarSTRVCTTURE OF sENTENCM Es.
casitically of man. "1Buit, God be thanked, his
pridle is gre-ater than his ignorance; and, wh-at
lie wa-nts in knowledge, hie supplies by s'ufficiency. When he has looked about hinm as far as
he can, he concludes th.ere is no more to be
-seen; when lie is at the end of hiis line, he is
at the bottom of the ocean; wvhen hie has shiot
his, best; he is suire nione ever did, or ever can
shoot better, or beyond it. His own reason h-e
holds to be the cranmeasure of truth; and
h-is own knonyledlge, of what Ais possible -in nature."' Ifere every to i'g is at once easy to
the breath, and gratJnd' to -the ear. We must
however observe, that if composition abound
witha sentences which have too many rests,, and
these placed at intervals apparentliy measuired
and regular, it i~ apt to savour of affectation.
The next thing which demnands attention, is
the close or cadence of the period. The only
im,pofthnt ruile, which can here be given, is
this, whien we aim at dignity or elevation, the.
seund should increase to the- last; th-e longest
niembers of the period., anid the fuillest and
most sonorous w'ords, should be reserved for- the
conclusion. As:an instanca of this, the followirn, sentence of Addison may, be given. "It
fill's thie nwind withi the largest varilety or ideas;
converses w-it its obj~ects -at th-e greatest dlistance; and continues thie lon.eti     ato
withiout being, tired or satiated with its proper
en; oyment ~.",  Here every readler must be
sesble of beauty in thie jzst distribution o-f
the lpauses, and in the manfier of rounding the-pejriod, andt of' brL gins itf. to a full and karmo-.Iuous ciose.It may be remarked, that little words in the
conclusion of a sentence are as injurious to
melody, as they are intconsistent with strength
of expression. A musical-close in our language
seems in general to require either the last syllable, or the last but one, to be a lono syllable.
Words which consist chiefly of short syllables,
as contrary,particul.zr, retrospect, seldom  termninate a sentence harmoniously, unless a previous run of long syllables have rendered them
pleasing to-the ear,
Sentences, however, which are so constructed, as to make the sound always swell toward
the end, and rest either on the last or penult
syllable, give a discourse the tone of declamation. If melody be not'varied, the ear is
soon cloyed with it.  Sentences constructed
in the same manner, with the pauses at equal
iatervals, should never succeed  each other.
Short sentences must be blended with long and
swelling ones, to riender discourse sprightly
as well as magnificent.
We nowproceed to treat of a higher species of harmony; the sound-adapted to the
sense. Of this we may remark: two degrees.
First, the current of solund suited to the tenor
of a discourse. Next, a peculiar reseniblance
effected between some object, and the sounds
that are employed in describing it.
Sounds have in many respects an intimate
correspotidence with our ideas; partly natural,
partly  produced  by  artificial associations.
Hence, any one modulation of sound continued,
stamps on style a certain character and expression. Sentences, constructed with Ciceronian

fullness, excite an idea of what is important,
magnificarit, and sedate. But they suit no violent passion, no eager reasoning, no familiar address. These require measures brisker, easier, and often more abrupt. It were as absurd
to write a panegyric and an invective in a style
of the same cadence, as to set the words of a
tender loeve song to the tune of a warlike
march.   Beside, the general correspondence
of the current of sound with the current of
thought, a more particular expression of certain objects by resembling sounds may be attempted. In poetry this resemblance is chiefly
to be sought. It obtains sometimes, indeed, in
prose-composition; but there in an inferior degree.
The sounds of words may be employed for
representing chiefly three classes of objects;
first, other sounds; secondly, motions; and
thirdly, the emotions and passions of the mind.
In most languages, the names of many particular sounds are so formed, as to bear some
resemblance of the sound which they sig.
nify; as with us the whistling of winds,the buzz
and hum of insects, the hiss of serpents, and the
crash of falling timber; and many other insiances, where the name is plainly adapted to the
sound it represents. A remarkable example of
this beauty may be taken from two passages in
Milton's Paradise Lost; in one of which he de,
scribes the sound, made by the opening of the
gates of hell; in the other, that made by the
opening of fbe gates of heaven.  The contrast between the two. exhibits to great advan95Oa             71 ~~~A RM0saY.

Observe the. smoothness of the other;
--Heaven opein'd wide6

In thie -second place, the sound of words isf
frequiebtly employed to imitate Motion     as it ie'sifl or slow, violent, or gentle, unifora. or in-,
terrui)ted, easy  or accompanfied    with eQffo rt.

which in our imiaginationi c-orrespond with that
miotion.   Long   syllables naturally excite. an
idea of slow miotion; as in this line. of Virgil,
Olli inter sese mnagna-vi beloaehia toilnoit.
A successien of short syllables gives the impressioin of quick motion; as,
Sed fujrit initerea, higit irreparabile tempos.
TJhe worlks of Homer and Virgil'abound withi
instances of' this boauty; which are so often
quoted, anDd so well knowna, that it is unnecessary to produce thiem.
The third set of objects, which. the sound ofl,words is capable of representing, consists of eme..

mind'for entering into that affection which the
poet intends to raise:; such arrangenment may
with propriety be said to resemble the sense.
Thus when pleasure, joy, and agreeable obh
jects, are described by one who feels his subject, the language naturally runs in smooth, iP
quid, and flowing numbers.
