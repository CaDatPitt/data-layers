MY YOUNG FRIENDS,
I am now going to tell you about the
many names given to the land, on the surface of the earth.
When you have been travelling you have, no doubt, observed that the land is greatly diversified; that is, some of
it is high and rocky, some low and sandy; and often near a
body of water it assumes a variety of forms and shapes.
Lesson VII.                           These and many other appearances of the land have
names given them by Geographers.

To THE PUPIL,
You remember I told you in a preceding lesson that the land is greatly diversified, and you
have learned the names of the several Natural Divisions of
the land; now you must learn that the water also has many
different names applied to it by Geographers, according to
its situation, form, etc.

To THE TEACHER:
It would be well to have the pupils refer to the map while repeating these lessons, until
they are able to recognize the order of memorizing the several natural and political divisions upon a map.
They might, after having accomplished thus much, say the lesson without the map, as many times as may be
deemed necessary.
One member of the class could be called upon to name the Islands; another, the Capes; a third, the Rivers.

Introductory Remarks on the Map of North America.
Having committed to memory the lessons prepared for
you, on the Maps of the Hemispheres, you may now commence the study of the Map of Northl America.
You will perceive by lookinig upon the map, that North
America is divided into several countries, each having a
separate name; these constitute the chief political divisions of North America. When we speak of natural or
physical divisions in geography, we mean only those which
have been formed by nature-such as rivers, bays, islands,
mountains, &amp;c. When we speak of political divisions, we
refer to those which have been made by man-such as
countries, cities, states, &amp;c.

THE experienced Teacher will readily perceive that the lessons, called "Memory's Aid," admit of being used in a
variety of ways. I would, however, suggest that the pupils be required first of all, to repeat the names of the several
natural and political divisions, both with and without the map, until all that it contains is thoroughly memorized; that is,
as far as the names of those divisions, and the order of saying them, are concerned.
Thlus much accomplished, the pupil should bound each country, state the location of each capital city, and correctly
describe each natural division.
One meTiber of the class might be called upon to mention the first river in order on the map, and another to
describe it. In this way, the pupils could proceed with all the other natural or physical divisions.

PREFACE.
_____     --        il HE present work is the fruit
-   -~ _  of a necessity in geographical
-  education, that has been very
__     I'' --- ~~  keenly realized by the Author,':~~   during several years of expe__       4            1rience as a public teacher.
In the study of this material science,
I~     she has found it peculiarly difficult, even
when following the methods of the best class-books
on the subject, to array it with the same perspicuity to
the mind of thl pupil, that may be imparted to more
metaphysical studies. That other teachers have contended witlh the same undefined obstacle, may be
gathered, not only from the confessions of a large mnajority of them, but also from the conrlfuised and very
limited geographical knowledge in the mental possession of most communities.  The constant recourse to
maps, every where conveniently suspended for reference, bears ocular demonstration to the dimness and
uncertainty that characterizes our geographical attainments. It is an experience too universal to be disputed,
that while the elements of some of the more abstruse
sciences remain available in the memory often through
life, those of geography are peculiarly shadowy and
evanescent.
It was in the conscientious endeavor to render thls
important branch as palpable to the understandings of
pupils as some of the other branches of their education,
that the Author was enabled to trace the source of the
difficulty just alluded to, to those defects in arrangement of the class-books in use that the present work
is designed to remedy. She saw that it was the premature employment of unexplained terms, and the
burying up of what, at present, only was attainable, by
that which should be the very last learned, that constituted the great impediment to the teacher in conveying, and to the scholar in acquiring, geographical knowledge. Maps, professedly intended to elucidate, were
rendered rather LABYRINTHS OF PRRPLEXITY, by being
covered with circles, lines, and various names and
emblems, mysterious to the pupil, irrelevant to his
stage of progress, and, by confusing the eye in its search
for more radical matters, the source of much vexatious
waste of time. In a word, she found in these classbooks a fatal. disregard of that system by which alone
any desired result can be surely    accomplished-a
system  whose rules are comprehended in the five
words, " one thing at a time."
From the foregoing remarks, the reader will anticipate the claims of the present work. It has been the
aim of the Author so to arrange the elemients, and
their exponents the maps, as to emancipate, as far as
possible, this inlteresting science from that dryness and
conlfusion that has hitherto rendered it a weariness and
an abstraction to all classes of learners. In pursuance
of this design it has been found expedient to issue
the work in parts: the present, for the beginner, being
the First of the Series.  The system herein adopted
will be literally retained throughout the Series; it
having been proved by experiment the best medium
for evolving in their natural connection the successive
proportions of the science. Through its operation, the
pupil is prepared not only to comprehend, but frequently to anticipate, what nlext should follow. It is
in this manner alone, that youthfiul interest can be
engaged in any compulsory pursuit of knowledge.
The unfolding mind craves knowledge; but it is only
that for which it has a conscious necessity. It is the
business of teaching to create and direct this necessity.
In obedience to this natural law, the maps and
illustrations of the present work have been designed
to accord strictly with the character of the lessons,
being, so to speak, A GRADUALLY ACCUMULATING, VISIBLE

mnight one attempt to make an accomplished architect
of an individual by merely showing him the city, from
time to time, from the toxver of Trrinity Church, as hope
to impart a clear and permanent idea of the rudiments
of Geography, through the instrumentality of a finished
and crowded map, however accurately drawn, or gorgeously colored, said map may be. No complication
with, or allusion to Mathematical Geography, therefore,
will be found in the present volume.  Commencing at
the foundation of the science, its endeavor is to make
the pupil thoroughly acquainted with the local and
relative positions of the Grand Divisions of the Earth,
extending their political divisions only so far as to include the principal capital cities. It also furnishes the
pupil with a reasonable number of the most important
islands, capes, bays, rivers; etc., on the earth's surface.
The subject is developed principally by progressive
questions. growing naturally out of each other; such
as might be supposed to spontanleously arise in the
mind of a learner.
In order to quicken the interest of the pupil', alnd
bring his Inagination to the aid of his understanding,
the mnain features of the lessons are also _pictorially
presented in a series of numerous designs exquisitely
drawn and engraved, that while they serve to instruct,
theymay also contribute to elevate and refine the taste
of'the pupil. This feature of the work will be duly
appreciated by every teacher who has had occasion to
lament the PURPOSELESS CARICATURES that deform many
of our class-books and waste the attention of scholars.
Small portions of descriptive Geography are likewise
introduced, at desirable intervals, as a means of relaxation to the student. The maps are clear and large, and
as the studies progress, throughout the Series, are
amplified only with such new matter as may be furnished by the corresponding lessons.
Through this system, the memory of the pupil
becomes so thoroughly and permanently possessed of
the contents of a map, as to render him capable, after a
timne, without consulting it, to describe each of its
physical and political divisions and localities, with intelligence and accuracy.  When it is remembered how
much time is expended, at present, in searching out
answers to questions on maps, the economy and value
of the system herein offered, will more fully appear.
In the order of succession of the maps of the present
work,' that of the United States is purposely reserved
as a final exercise, by virtue of its complicacy.
To facilitate a recapitulatory examination of the
scholar, a department denominated "Memory's Aid,'
always succeeds the exercises introduced after each map.
From these several departments of the work questions
may be presented in as many diversified forms, or reversions, as the teacher or examiner thinks advisable; and if
the pupils have properly learned the preceding lessons,
a correct and intelligent answer will always promptly
follow.  A Pronouncing Vocabulary, containing the
names of all the natural and political divisions used
throughout the work, is appended. This Vocabulary
affords the material for a final examination, by which
the examiner can determine the precise kind and
amount of geographical knowledge, possessed by any
pupil. The importance of this original and valuable
arrangement will be self-evident: as heretofore, no
method of ascertaining individual deficiencies in this
important science, has been furnished by the classbooks on the subject; consequently, pupils have been
allowed to graduate from our schools with the crudest
and most erratic ideas of a simple subject, that has
occupied their patient investigation for years.
Having thus, as briefly as the plan will admit, defined the nature and intentionl of the present work.
the Author confidently submits the system  to the
ordeal of experiment.
The claims it proposes for universal adoption are:
First, That it will endow a pupil with a thorough
and permanent knowledge of Geography, in at least
one-half of the time heretofore required for the purpose.
Second, That its system is mentally refreshing,
capable of enlisting and retaining the interest of the
pupil, throughout the Series, and of putting the
teacher in possession of a gauge to test, as accurately
as in Mathematics, what the pupil knows of the
science.
Third, That it will promote uniformity in all the
classes of a school, wherein the entire Series is used, as
there is but one method for memorizing the conltents
of a map, for each class, the rules for which will be
given in the second number of the Series, that result
being accomplished in the present numnber by means
of the questions.
Such are its claims; and however important or
pretentious they may seem on the surface, the Author
has the evidence of experiment to prove the internal
power of the system, and that these claims for it are
not falsely erected.
