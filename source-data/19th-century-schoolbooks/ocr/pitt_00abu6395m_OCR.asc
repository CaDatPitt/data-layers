IDIGESTION AND ABSORPTION.-—TI-IE
LYMPHATIC SYSTEM.

SECTION I.— 1. Food repairs the waste of the body, and
keeps up life. If asked how it is made to do this, you
could answer, “ It is eaten.” By that, youmean that it is
taken into the mouth, and chewed, and swallowed. But

"if asked again, What becomes of it after it is swallowed,

and how does it get into our bones and ﬂesh and brains,
and keep every particle living, and perhaps growing, you
could not answer without study. For, in health, we know
nothing about our food, by our feelings, after it is swal-
lowed.

2. If, however, we examine into the matter, we ﬁnd that
the food, after being swallowed, passes on down a tube
which extends through the whole length of the trunk, be-
ginning at the lips. This tube is the alimentary canal.

3. The alimentary canal is about twenty—seven feet long,
in a man. In order to get it into the trunk of the body,
which is only about two feet long, a portion of it is coiled
up in a mass. This portion we call the bowels.

4. Most of the canal is about an inch and a half wide.

SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS. ——1. An emulsion can be made with oil and
the white of an egg, .or with mucilage obtained from the druggist’s. This
can be compared with a mixture of water and oil.

2. A tube made of chamois leather, or a cone of ﬁlter-paper, will illus-
trate the soaking through membranes.

In two places it spreads out, ‘as a brook spreads into a

pond. One of these en-
largements is the stom-
ach; the other, the large
intestine. _

5. One layer of the
Wall of the canal is in-
voluntary muscle. Part
of the ﬁbers run length-
wise, and part crosswise;
and they surround the
tube.

6. The canal is lined
membrane.
Mucous membrane can
be seen on the Walls of
the mouth. It is quite
like the skin in struc-
ture, but differs in being
soft and moist and red.
The mucous membrane
lines the alimentary
canal, and other cavities
in the body, just as the
skin covers the outside.

tary canal as a whole.

or gullet; then to the stomach, which lies at the lower
border of the ribs, in front; then to the small intestine,
which is twenty feet long, coiled in the lower part of the
abdomen; then to tl1e large wlntestine, which is ﬁve feet
long, and ends the tube.

DIVISIONS OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL.

1. MOUTH. 4. STOMACH.

2. PHARYNX (Throat). 5. SMALL INTESTINE.
3. (EsoPHAGUs (Gullet). 6. LARGE INTESTINE.

8. Each of these divisions of the canal has its own
peculiarities, and each has its own part of the work of the

' whole to do. This work is called digestion.

9. By digestion, we mean the changes that take place in
the food, as it passes through the alimentary canal, by
which it is ﬁtted to be taken into the blood.

10. The need of such changes is very plain. We could

not imagine that the food, in the condition in which it is _

eaten, could be taken into the blood. There are no open-
ings from the canal into the blood-vessels. Nothing can
get out of it into the rest of the body, unless it can soak
through its walls, as water would soak out of the ﬁnger
of a glove if it were poured into it. . To do this, the food
must be dissolved.

11. A lump of sugar or salt will dissolve in water; but
a piece of meat, ora cooked egg, or oatmeal, or many other
articles of food, will not. All such articles must be changed
in the alimentary canal, so that they will dissolve in water.

12. We ﬁnd,.accordingly, that from the walls of the
canal, and from certain organs called glands which lie
just outside of the canal, and communicate with it by

I)IG'ESTION A N1) A 1: sol: 1’ TIO N. 101

tubes, juices are poured out, called digestive juices, which
mix with the food, and make in it the very changes that
are required. These juices differ from each other, and
come into different portions of the canal. One juice acts
on one kind of food, and another mice on another kind.
13. The butter and cream, and all the other fats, that we
eat, are acted on in a way peculiar to themselves. They
are not really made to dissolve in water; but a juice is
furnished, called the pancreatic juice, with which they
are so thoroughly mixed,.that they will pass through that
part of the wall of the alimentary canal which is their
special Way out. i»   a
14. There are some other ﬂuids, besides this pancreatic
juice, that oil will mix with; and such mixtures are called
.e~m'u,lsio'n,s. Milk is an emulsion. The oil-globules dif-
fused through it rise to the top, and make the cream; and
from the cream we make butter, by the method already

described (Chap. VI, Sect. 1., 23). \Ve eat the butter. It '

passes down, without being changed, until it reaches the
place where the pancreatic juice comes in. With that it
mixes; and all these little oil—globules are separated
again, and diffused through the ﬂuid, just as they were at
first in the milk. This fluid is the chyle; and it looks
so Very like milk, that the little hair-like tubes that carry
it away, after it has passed through the wall of the canal,
are called lacteals, or milk-Vessels. (Latin, lac, milk.)
15. The muscle in the walls of the canal has a good deal
to do with digestion, as well as the juices inside. It acts
in two ways: it forces the food along, and it kneads and
mixes it with the juices.- VVe know how the muscles of
the mouth and throat close about it, when we swallow.
These are voluntary muscles, and we are ‘conscious of their

102 THE HUMAN BODY.

action. VVhen it gets below the throat, the muscles are
still contracting around it and behind it, pushing it on, as
we strip water froma soft tube by drawing it between our
ﬁngers. But these are involuntary muscles, and we are
not conscious of their action. VVhile it remains in the
stomach, the muscles are constantly “working” it, very
much as a baker works his bread to mix the yeast with
it. The same processes continue through the small and
the large intestine.

If the juices are too scanty, or poor in quality, diges-
tion does not go on well. If the muscle of the walls of
the canal is weak or sluggish, digestion does not go on
well. These conditions are called dyspepsia.

16.. VVhat has been said of the changes in the food, that
constitute digestion, may be summed up as follows: The
fats are made into a ﬁne emulsion. The other kmds of
food are changed into substances that easily dissolve’ in
the ﬂuids of the canal.

THE TEETH.

17. Let us examine more particularly the different
parts of the digestive apparatus. " Just behind the lips, the
outer gates of the alimentary canal, stand the inner gates,
the teeth. A child of about ﬁve years of age, who has not
yet lost any of his first teeth, has twenty in all, ten in each
jaw. If we could look deep into his jaw-bones, we should
see, beneath these twenty, twenty-eight more,--buds of

teeth, so to speak, which are his second set (all but four),  

almost ready to grow out. So that, at thatage, a child
has really forty-eight teeth,-more than at any other time
in his life. i

18. The first set are,--

DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION. 103

Eight incisors (cutters), four front teeth above and
below.

Four canines (Latin, comis, a dog), next to the incisors.

Eight molars (Latin, mola, a mill), grinders, back
teeth.

The incisors are chisel-shaped, and intended for cutting,
not for chewing.

The canines correspond to the long, pointed fangs of
a dog, and are made for piercing and holding on to
things.

The molars are broad and blunt, and are made for
grinding up food.

19. The second set, the last of which do not appear before

theiage of seventeen years, comprises

Eight vlncisors, four front teeth above and below.
Four can/mes, next to the incisors.
T Eight bzktvspids, next to the canines.

Twelve molars, back teeth.

The first set come out, one by one, between the ages of
ﬁve and fourteen years; and the second set appear one
by one as the ﬁrst are lost. The wisdom teeth are the
last to appear, at some time after seventeen years of age.

20. Animals that live wholly on ﬂesh, like the tiger,
have no grinders, but only cutting-teeth. Their jaws do
not move from side to side, but only up and down, like
shears. On the other liand, animals that live wholly on
vegetable food have many broad grinders, and not so
many cutting-teeth in proportion; and their jaws have a
motion from side to side,_as well as up and down. Man
is well provided with both kinds of teeth, which goes to
prove that he was made to live on both vegetable and
animal food.

10-ll s THE HUMAN BODY.

21. A tooth is made of a substance like bone, called
dentine. At the end of the root, a very small hole can
be seen. This is the entrance to a canal
which runs through it lengthwise, and
contains the tiny nerve and blood-vessel
which supply it; The root is ﬁxed in a
socket in the jaw-bone. The crown, or
body, projects it beyond the gums. The
neck is at the junction of crown and root.
The crown is covered by enamel, which
is the hardest substance in the body.

. J 22. It is the work of the teeth to bite
Fig. 38. off mouthfuls of food of the right size,
WCISOR TOOTH-‘U-WED and then to grind them up ﬁne. This
IN Two’ is the ﬁrst act in digestion. When food
is well ground, the juices of the stomach easily mix with
it, and act on it. If the teeth are gone, or if food is bolted
without being chewed, it enters the stomach in lumps,
which the juices can not easily pene-
trate. VVhen food is not soon acted on
by the digestive juices, it becomes sour,
and makes gases, which distend the
stomach, and often give pain.

23. The teeth stop growing after
they have taken their places; and, if
they are chipped, they do not heal.
They may be injured,—— .

THE SALIVARY GLANDS.

24. In health, the mouth is always moist. When We
taste any good thing, or even think of it, the “mouth
waters.” This water is the saliva, or spittle; and most of
it comes from bodies called the salivary glands.

25. There are three pairs of these glands,——two parotid
glands, two submaxillary glands, and two sublingual
glands.

SALIVABY GLANDS.-— 1. Parotid gland. - 2. Submaxillary gland. 3. Sublingual gland.

The parotid gland is the largest, and is situated just
under the ear. Mumps is an inﬂammation of this gland,
which makes it swell, and the neighboring parts of the
neck with it.

The sabmasmlllary gland is next in size, and lies behind
the edge of the under jaw beneath the ﬂoor of the mouth.

The sublingual gland lies farther forward than the sub-
maxillary, also under the ﬂoor of the mouth.

106   THE HUMAN BODY.

26. Each one of these glands has one or more tubes,
called ducts, opening into the mouth. The duct of the
parotid gland opens on the inside of the cheek. The ducts
of the submaxillary and sublingual glands open under
the tongue.

27. These glands make the saliva“ from the blood which
passes through them. The saliva moistens and softens
the mouthful of food, coats it over, so that it will slip
down the canal, and to some extent dissolves it. When
the mouth is absolutely dry, it is almost impossible to
chew or swallow any thing.

THE STOMACH‘.

28. The stomach is a portion of the alimentary canal
about twelve inches long, expanded into a pouch. It lies
at the lower border of the ribs in front, more on the left
side than on the right. When it is empty, it collapses, like
any other bag. When it is full, it extends down below
the ribs; and, as it lies directly under the heart, it some-
times presses up, and makes the heart feel crowded.

29. This pouch, like the rest of the alimentary canal, is
lined With mucous membrane, somewhat like the lining
of the mouth. If this membrane is examined with a lens,
innumerable little holes appear: so small, and so close
together, are they, that it has been estimated that there
are ﬁve millions of them in all. These are the mouths
of little pits that dip down in the membrane. Some of
these pits are shaped like the ﬁnger of a glove: others
have side—branches, like several glove-ﬁngers opening into

one central ﬁnger. These are the glands of the stomach,  

which make the gastric juice. When food enters the
stomach, this juice wells up from the pits until a drop

is a ring of muscular

stands at the mouth of each one. This overﬂows, and
another follows; and so it keeps coming, until there is
just enough to mix with the food taken. Then it stops.
Meantime the muscular walls have been turning and
squeezing the food, some-
what as the teeth and
tongue do in the mouth.
30. The outlet of the
stomach is at its right
end, and is guarded by
the pylorus (from a Greek
word, meaning keeper of
the gate). This pylorus

ﬁbers, which surrounds
the canal, and, by con-
tracting, closes it. Its duty
is, to let no food pass out until it has been properly acted
on by the stomach. When the food is hard and indigest-
ible, the laboring stomach often becomes exhausted and
distressed. It would fain get rid of its contents: but the
pylorus steadfastly resists, until vomiting occurs; or else,
this resistance being overcome, the troublesome matters
pass down, to cause similar discomfort in the intestines.

31. Near the beginning of the small intestine, two little
tubes open into it by the same oriﬁce. If we follow these
back a short. distance, one will lead us to the liver, the
other to the pancreas.

W 33. So large an organ as the liver must have a Very
important work. When the ﬂow of bile is cut off, the

ﬂesh is rapidly lost, and death ensues. Sometimes the
duct of the liver gets clogged. The yellow stream of bile
is dammed up, and forces itself into the blood-vessels, and
is carried all through the body. It colors the skin and
eyes yellow. This condition is called jaundice.

The bile in the intestine mingles with the other diges-
tive juices, and with the food, and aids digestion in sev-
eral Ways. ‘

34. The pancreas lies across the backbone, just behind
the stomach. It is only one-twentieth as large as the
liver. It is a mass of little tubes, in which the pancreatic
juice is forming during digestion. These little tubes
empty into one large tube, which runs through its Whole

T length, and ﬁnally discharges into the intestine, just as

the small drain-pipes in the houses of a town empty into
the large main in the street, and that, ﬁnally, into the
river.

35. The pancreatic juice makes a mixture, called an
emulsion, of’ the fats, in which they can easily pass
through the walls of the canal. It also aids in dissolving
other parts of the food. y

36. The limhszg of the whole length of the small and
large intestines contains little pits similar to those which
are found in the stomach. A ﬂuid called the intcstiizal
juice, which helps digestion, wells up out of them; but
the action of this ﬂuid is not so important as that of the
gastric juice.

37. Recapitulation. The digestive apparatus consists
of the alimentary canal, and certain glands connected
with it. c

ABSORPTION.
SECTION II.—1. The alimentary canal may be likened

S to the kitchen in which the food is prepared. The blood
is the carrier, swiftly moving through the passage-ways,‘

and serving every room in the house of life. I

2. Through the whole length of the canal, its wall is
ﬁlled with meshes of hair-like blood-vessels, completely
surrounding it, like a net-work, ready to soak up the food
through their thin Walls just as fast as it is made ready.
Through these little vessels the current is moving, so that
fresh blood is continually taking the place of that which
has just passed on With its load.

3. Let us follow a mouthful of food, consisting of bread
and meat, from its entrance between the lips into the
canal. First the teeth cut and grind it, the tongue and
checks skillfully turning and shifting it from side to side,
the saliva, meantime, Wetting and partly dissolving it.
When it is ﬁne and soft enough, the tongue forces it
against the roof s of the mouth, and so slips it back to the
throat. Certain muscles then contract, and lift the throat
up around it. It is clasped and pushed down by the con-

traction of successive rings of muscular ﬁbers, through

the gullet into the stomach. There it
remains for a time. It has not been
long in the stomach before portions of
it are digested, and these begin to pass
through its Walls. Other portions are
not digested by the gastric juice. But
the Whole is reduced to a ﬂuid—like
gruel, and then passes the pylorus
into the small intestine. In this state
it is called chyme. Here it meets the
bile and the pancreatic juice. These
mix with the fat, and make an emul-
sion Which is called chyle. The rest
of the food is also changing, and being
dissolved out of the branny and ﬁbrous
parts which can not be digested.

scope We can see that the
reason that it looks so, is, that
it actually has a nap, like
This -nap is made of
1 innumerable short, thread-
- 1 like projections, which are
called villi (Latin, villus, a
tuft of hair).

With a micro-

kind of vessels called lacteals, which will be described
presently, Whose special Work it is to take up fat.

6. As the muscular walls of the intestine contract and
relax, these little villi are Worked in the mass of food;
and they draw in the digested part as the ﬁne rootlets of
a plant draw up liquid nourishment from the earth in
which they stand.

7. As the chyme and chyle pass on down the small
intestine, the digestible portion is constantly growing
less, until at length it has all been taken up,——-the chyle
chieﬂy by the lacteals, and the other portions of the
food chieﬂy by the blood-vessels; and What remains is

_indigestible and useless.

8. The food, having thus become a part of the blood, is
carried through the body, and permitted to soak out
through the Walls of the capillary vessels, to feed each
particle of living substance.

9. VVater, and mineral matters like salt, that are dis-
solved in water, need no digestion, and are taken up by
the vessels in all partssof the canal. ‘

SECTION III.-—The lymphatic system. 1. This is a
system of tubes and glands,—the tubes resembling the
blood-vessels in some respects. They begin with hair—like
tubes running among the capillaries, and much like them.
These unite to form larger tubes, which unite with others,
and so on, until they have all been united into two tubes,
each about as large as a slate-pencil. These open into the
large veins, not far from the heart. They are called the
thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct.

2. But the lymphatic system is not just like the system
of blood—vessels. The lymph, as the ﬂuid which they con-

DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION. 113

tain is called, does not “circulate.” The blood starts from
the heart, and is brought around back to the heart again.
The lymph starts from all parts of the body, and is

brought in toward the heart. If you compare the lym-
phatic Vessels with the capillaries and Veins, you have

nothing in this system to correspond with the arteries.

114   THE HUMAN BOD Y.

The lymphatic vessels are much more delicate and
slender than the blood—vessels. .

3. When a farmer has a Wet ﬁeld, he frequently lays
pipes in it made of burned clay, called tile. The standing
water soaks into these pipes, and is carried off; and so
the ﬁeld is dried.

The lymphatics are the drain-pipes of the body. They
assist the blood-vessels in taking up the ﬂuids Which are
standing in all parts, and carrying them away to be
delivered up to the blood-stream at the proper place.

4. The lacteals comprise that portion of the lym-
phatic vessels that
begins in the Walls
of the small intes-
tine. When diges-
tion is not going on,
they are drain-pipes,
like the rest. As

control of the Will. In health it takes care of itself, and
we give no thought to it. But, when the digestive appa-

ratus is weak or disordered, it becomes the seat of almost
constant pain and discomfort. The appetite is lost, the
strength fails, the nerves become irritable, and the brain is
clouded. It is important, therefore, to know what helps or
hinders it.

- HINDERANCES TO DIGESTION.

1. Eating too fast. In this case, the food is taken down
without being prepared by chewing.

2. Strong excitement. Sudden fear, anger, or grief takes
away the appetite, and stops the flow of the digestive
juices.

3. Great fatigue. No careful horse-owner will feed his

L animal immediately when he comes in tired and heated.

Food swallowed under such circumstances will be digested
with difficulty by a man or a horse.

  4. Mental eﬁort. It is not well to read, or to study during
a meal. The mind should be at rest, and some degree
of attention should be given to the food.

5. Too much food. Evidently there is a limit to the
amount of food that can be digested. The stomach may
be so full that it can not easily move its contents. The
quantity may be so great that the digestive ﬂuids can not
fully permeate them. Those parts of the mass which are
not digested will soon decompose, producing acidity, and
a pressure of gas.

6. Too much liquid with food. A good deal of water is
directly absorbed. But, when too much is taken, some
remains in the stomach, and so dilutes the gastric juice,
that it is weakened.

7. Very cold substances, as ice-water, taken with food, will
sometimes stop digestion. The gastric juice acts best in a

116   THE HUMAN BODY.

temperature of about a hundred degrees. Stomachs, how-
ever, differ in their ability to Withstand cold as much as
the outer parts of the body.

8. Irregularity in eating. The digestive apparatus is
subject to habit, like the rest of the system. At the ac-
customed meal-time, the saliva and the other digestive
ﬂuids will flow, though no food is taken. When that time
ispassed, they do not start so readily. ‘ ~

9. Lack of exercise. In a sluggish condition of the body,
the digestive juices ﬂow slowly. The alimentary canal
does not contract vigorously to knead the food.

10. In applying these principles, it is to be remembered
that one person can do without harm, and sometimes with

~ advantage, what is injurious to another. Men differ very

Widely in their habits. Each should understand the
facts and principles of physiology, and apply them, with
the aid of experience, to his own case. - I

EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON DIGESTION.

SECTION V.—1. Alcohol irritates the mucous mem-
branes. You could not hold it in your mouth; and, if
you should swallow any of it clear, your stomach would
seem burned. When mixed with . much water, as it
is in Wines and liquors, it is less ﬁery, and the sensa-
tions produced in the mouth and stomach may be agree-
able. d   .   A or

2. It is by this irritant quality that it injures the
stomach. In the famous case of St. Martin, the insideof
whosestomach could be observed through a wound, Dr.
Beaumont found that “the free use of ardent spirits, Wine,

beer, or any of the intoxicating liquors, whencontinued;

DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION. 117

for some days,” constantly produced “a state of inﬂa1nma-
tion and ulceration in the lining membrane, and change
of the gastric juice.” At the same ti1ne,St. Martin suffered
no pain, or other sensations, which indicated the true state
of things.

Examinations of the stomachs of drinkers, after death,
show the same conditions.

3. One of the most wonderful things about our bodies
is, that they will change so as to suit the ccmdz't2fons in which
they are. If a man has to Work with his arms, they grow
large and strong. If the skin is exposed to the weather,
or to chaﬁng, it loses its smoothness, and becomes hard.
The stomach was made to digest wholesome food. If a

a man insists on making it a receptaclaecfor burning liquors,

Nature straightway begins to adapt it to that use. The
delicate membrane grows tough. The mucus which nat-
urally moistens it becomes thick and ropy, so as to protect
the surface. Some of the little glands which pour out
the gastric juice are destroyed. Those which remain are
unhealthy. If the process is carried far enough, he has a
pouch which gladly receives alcohol, but its usefulness as
a stomach is greatly impaired. A

4. If we put in a test-tube some gastric juice from the
stomach of an animal, and add alcohol to it, a white
powder appears, and settles to the bottom. This is pepsin,
which gives the juice its power to digest. Alcohol sepa-
rates it from the juice; so the drinker, with a stomach
perhaps already weak, is adding to his gastric juice that
which destroys, for the time, what activity it has. After
the alcohol passes out of the stomach, the pepsin is
dissolved again.

5. The effect of alcohol on the intestine is similar to

that on the stomach, but much less; because most of it is
absorbed before reaching that part of the canal.

6. Alcohol is carried to the liver by the blood.

Alcohol irritates the liver, and causes an overfullness of
its blood-vessels.

Alcohol often excites inﬂammation of the liver. This
is followed by various changes, one of the most notable
of which is a contraction into a hard, knobbed mass,
called, in medical works, gin-dm'nIcer’s liver.

7. Thus the power of digesting food, which is the source
of health and strength, is assailed by alcohol at two im-
portant points, -— in the stomach, and in the liver.

8. The effect of alcohol on the kidneys may be referred
to here, because it is similar to its effect on the liver. The
kidneys are purifying organs. The blood is constantly
passing through them, and they ﬁlter out of it waste
matters. Blood charged with alcohol irritates them, and
excites, frequently, a slow inﬂammation, which results in
their destruction. This is one of the forms of Bright's
disease, and in most cases is incurable.

9. These effects do not alwaysfollow the use of alcohol,
but in very many cases they do. They are the possibili-
ties and dangers of the drug.

CHAPTER VIII.

RBSPIRATION AND THE VOICE.

SECTION I.—-Air. 1. We have studied the processes of
digestion and absorption, by which food and water get
into the blood, to be distributed through the body. It
remains to study the method by which air is taken in and
used. The process is called respiration.

2. We live i11 air, and we can not live out of it any
more than ﬁshes ca11 live out of water. We can not see
the air, but we can feel it. When it is moving Very
rapidly, it has great force. It can root up trees, and
carry away houses. If we could see it, it would appear
like water. VVhen the wind is blowing, we would see a
stream of it pouring across the country like a river, or
like a ﬂowing sea.

SUGGESTIONS To TEACHERS. ——SEcTioN I. A few chemical experiments
will illustrate this section. Show the effect of oxygen and of.carbonic-acid
gas on a burning candle. Fill a test~tube with lime-water. and breathe into
it to demonstrate carbonic-acid gas by the formation of a milky precipitate
of carbonate of lime.

SECTION II. Show, if possible, a ﬁsh's gills. Illustrate by drawings:
by a bunch of grapes. etc. Get a piece of lung from the butcher‘s, or, still
better, the lungs and air-passages of some small animal.

p SECTION III. The nasal cavities should be shown. either in the human
skull, or in that of a sheep or other animal. .

SECTION IV. Simple experiments with the apparatus mentioned in the
text, will illustrate the principles.‘

SEcT1oN VI. Show the moisture in the breath by breathing on glass.

SECTION VII. A larynx can easily be got from a butcher, and the glottis
and vocal cords and muscles can be shown.

3. Air is a material substance, though invisible. It‘ is
in the gaseous condition. It is composed chieﬂy of three
gases mixed.

COMPOSITION OF AIR.

Nitro en about. . . . . 79 arts in a hundred.’
1 .

Oxygen, about . . .. . 21 “‘ “ “

Carbonic-acid gas, about . . . .04 “ “ “

Besides, there is watery vapor, and a little of various other
substances.

s 4. Nitrogen gas, which constitutes nearly four-ﬁfths of
the air, is not used either by animals or plants. Neither
is it injurious. Its oﬂice is to dilute the oxygen. If We
put a lighted candle into a jar containing pure oxygen, it
will burn up very rapidly. So, if an animal is made to
breathe pure oxygen, it is greatly excited; and its life,
which is partly a burning, is quickly burned out. The
nitrogen iii the air dilutes the oxygen to just the right
strength.

5. Carbomeacid gas is not used by animals. On the
other hand, they are constantly throwing it off as a Waste
product. But plants live on it: it is a large part of their
food. As they take it in, they give off oxygen.

Animals take in oxygen, and give out carbonic-acvfd gas.

Plants take in carb0nz'c—acid gas, and give out 02:ggen.s

Fires, and the decay of animal and vegetable matters, are
adding constantly to the carbonic-acid gas. But there is
only one process which is adding to the oxygen ; a11d that
is, the action of the leaves of plants. On the whole, the
addition and subtraction are equal. The amount of car-
bonic-acid gas in the Whole air remains the same, though
in a smoky city it is greater than it is in the country.

6. Ox;/gen is the most remarkable of the elements.
Three-fourths of the material of which our bodies are
made is oxygen: eight—ninths of the material of which
wateris made is oxygen. It is more than half the Weight
of many other substances. VVe can not live ﬁve minutes
without a fresh supply of it. It is inﬁnitely more valu-
able than gold, but is free to all. We do not have to
work for it, as We do for food: we take it from the air We
breathe. ,

« THE LUNGS.

SECTION II.——1. The whole of the air that we take in
doesnot enter the blood. Just as the digestible parts of

our food are absorbed, While the indigestible parts are '

cast out, so that part of the air that we need, which is
oxygen, is absorbed in the lungs, and the rest is breathed
out.

2. The lungs are masses of little cells, with very thin
walls, placed in the chest.   On the outside of the walls of
these sacs are the capillaries,—millions of them. They
cover the sacs as the netting covers a balloon, only they
are much closer than such a net. The blood from the
pulmonary artery pours into these capillaries, and so
spreads out all over the lung-cells. The oxygen, then, has
only to pass through the thin lung-cell and the thin capil-
lary wall to enter the blood.

3. Frogs get a part of their oxygen through their skins.
These are delicate and moist, and just beneath them the
net—work of capillaries is spread out. Oxygen easily

gen they can take in from it through their skins. Man’s

skin is thicker, and does not allow the oxygen to pass
through.

4. Fishes have a peculiar way of getting their oxygen.
They, of course, must take it from the air which is dis-
solved in the water. On each side of their throats they

RESPIRATION AND THE VOICE. 125

have an opening, in which are a number of ﬂat plates
of membranes, called gills, with net-works of blood-ves-
sels in them. The water is swallowed,and
passes out between the plates through these
openings. The oxygen which it contains
enters through the thin membranes into
the vessels. .

5. Other animals take in oxygen in a
different way. a But, though the way is dif-
ferent, the principle is the same. In every
case, the capillary vessels are spread over
a «thin membrane; and the air is on the other side of
that membrane. '

6; In some of the lower animals, thelung is a single
sac, like a bladder, with the capillaries on the outside.
In man, instead of being a single sac, each lung is a Vast
number of very small sacs bound together in a mass, with
ﬁne blood-vessels and air-tubes surrounding and connect-
ing them.

Imagine a bunch of grapes with the contents of each
grape taken out, leaving only the skins to represent the
air—cells. Suppose the stems to be hollow, and they will
represent the air-tubes. Now, put several such bunches
together, so that the main stems all join in one large
stem, and you have something which represents the air-
cells and air—tubes of a lung. To make it complete, sup-
pose all the grapes to be joined by ﬁne threads, like a
spider’s web. This represents the ﬁbrous tissue, which is
quite elastic. Suppose a blue tube to run along the main
stem, and divide every time the stem does, until its small
branches ﬁnally reach every grape, and form a net-Work
on it. From that net-work suppose red tubes to run

126 THE HUMAN BOD Y.

back by the sides of the blue ones, joining, constantly,
other tubes, until all are united in two large ones on the
main stem of our bunches of grapes. The blue tubes are
the pulmonary artery and its branches. The net-Works
on the grapes are the capillaries, and the red tubes are
the pulmonary veins.

we add the lymphatic Vessels and nerves, we have all that
makes up the lung.

RESPIRATION AND THE VOICE. 127

7. A tree is another illustration of a lung. The trunk
represents the bronchus, or great air-tube, which enters
the lung. The branches represent the small (bronchial)
tubes. The leaves represent the air-cells. If we suppose
tubes to be laid along the trunk and branches, constantly
dividing, until ﬁnally each leaf is covered with a net-
work from which other tubes come off, and run back
toward the trunk, uniting as they go, we shall have
again something like a lung, with the ﬁbrous tissue,
the nerves, and lymphatic vessels and glands, still to be
added.

r 8. Do not suppose, however, that, on examining a lung,
you would see all these tubes and cells. On the contrary,

a you would see only a light-gray or pinkish substance,

mottled with black spots, very smooth on the outside. If

you were to cut into it, it would look a little like fat. ,

The cells, and many of the tubes, are so small, that only
Very careful study with the microscope has given us our
knowledge of them.

THE AIR-PASSAGES.

SECTION III.—1. The passages by which the air gets
to the lungs, are,-

The nose, The larynx, _ ,
The mouth, The trachea, l (Wmdp1pe)'

The throat, The bronchi.

2. The nose is the true breathing passage. It consists
of two parts:—

1. The triangular projection from the face. This is
partly cartilage, which is ﬂexible, and partly bone.

2. The cavities behind, called the nasal fossac. There
are two of these, corresponding to the two nostrils, sepa-

two openings, like the two on the face. Above, they con-

with cavities in the upper

eyes.

3. The nerves of smell are up in the top of the nasal
cavities. In ordinary breathing, the air passes straight
back to the throat; but, when we wish to smell any
thing distinctly, we sniff suddenly, and so draw the air

i up to the top of the cavities, with the odorous particles

in it.

4. The odorous particles will diffuse themselves through
the cavities, and reach the nerves, without this sniffing,
unless they are few and faint. But, by sniffing the air,
We get the sensation more quickly and keenly. -

5. A horse can not breathe through his mouth, but a
man can. VV e do so when the nose is stopped, and when
we are breathing rapidly, as in exercise. Some always
do so when asleep.

It is better to breathe through the nose, because, —  

  1. The nasal cavities being narrow, the air is spread out

in a thin sheet, and so is warmed by the warm walls of
the cavities. It passes through the mouth in a large
stream, and pours into the lungs without being properly
warmed in cold weather.

2. Dry air, passing through the nasal cavities, is not only
warmed, but moistened. VVhen it is taken through the
mouth, it dries the throat, as any one can learn by trying
it rapidly for a few moments. Hence, the practice tends
to produce sore-throat.

3. Snoring is a result of sleeping with the mouth open.
The soft palate, which hangs like a curtain between the
passages from the nose and the mouth, is relaxed in sleep.
The two currents of air, one on each side of it, cause it to

i Vibrate rapidly, just as a sheet will flap and rattle in the

Wind.

6. The habit of breathing through the nose, both in ,

Waking and sleeping hours, should, therefore, be culti-
Vated._ One of the best safeguards against catching cold in
the throat, on going from a heated room into the night
air, is to keep the mouth shut.

7.‘ The throat is both a food—passage and an air-passage.
Air is sometimes swallowed into the stomach: food and
drink sometimes enter the wind-pipe; but, if they do, there
is a great disturbance, and they must be coughed out at
once. Commonly, each takes its proper course,—the food
through the gullet, the air through the wind-pipe, and that

‘ without any thought on our part. The apparatus is self-

regulating. VVhen we swallow, the breathing—passage
closes up tight; and a kind of trap-door, called the epi-
glottis, shuts down over it. You can not swallow and
breathe at the same time.

8. The larynx, which is the upper part of the wind-

180   THE HUMAN BODY.

pipe, is a kind of a box made of cartilage. It is wider
than the rest of the wind-pipe, and projects in front,

making Adam’s apple. It is the voice—box. In it are

the vocal cords, or bands, by which sound is made. It
will be more fully described hereafter.

9. The trachea is a tube four or ﬁve inches long, and
from half an inch to an inch in diameter, extending from
the larynx down into the chest. It is made of _a series of
flat rings of cartilage, sixteen or twenty in number, which
do not quite come together behind, but are somewhat like
a horseshoe. These are connected, and covered with mem-

c brane and muscular ﬁbers. They serve to keep the tube
open.

10. The trachea divides into two branches, called bron-
chi. One goes to the right, and one to the left, lung.
They are made just like the trachea, and are one or two
inches long.

11. Each bronchus, as it enters the lung, divides into
smaller tubes, called bronchial tubes; and these keep on
dividing until they are not more than 771,7; of an inch in
diameter. They then end in the air-cells.

BREATHING.

SECTION IV.——1. We have studied the lungs, and the
passages leading to them. We have now to study the
process by which air goes in and out of them. It is not
enough that the passage is open. The lungs are not like

a house, with windows and doors, through which the .

breeze plays freely. They are, rather, like a deep well,
or a mine, intowhich fresh air will not go, unless, in
some way, a current is made. We make this current by
breathing.

RESPIRA TION AND THE’ VOICE. 131

2. If you watch the breathing, you will see two regular
movements. First, the chest and abdomen seem to swell;
and then, in a moment, they fall back to their former
size. This is repeated with every breath. The chest does
enlarge; and, as it enlarges, the air rushes in, to ﬁll the
extra space. As it grows smaller, the same amount of air
that entered is squeezed out again.

Why does the air rush in, when the space is made
larger‘? Because air is like
Water: it is pressing in every
direction. If you put water
in a tub with a pipe opening
outpof it, it will force itself
into the pipe. If you put
a bottle under water, with
the mouth up, the water will
push in, and ﬁll it. ‘We are
in the air as the bottle is in
the water. If the bottle is
made of rubber, the water will
ﬂow out when we squeeze it,
and will flow in again when
it expands. The chest may 
be likened to such a rubber Fig. 51.
bottle_ THE CHEST.

The chest is like a bellows, with one exception: in a
bellows, the air enters by one opening, and goes out of
another; in the chest, air enters and goes out by the same
opening. ’ . T

3. How is the chest made larger? Intwo ways,—

1. By the descent of the diaphragm.

2. By the raising of the ribs and breast—bone.

The diaphragm.

132   THE HUMAN BOD Y.

The diaphragm is attached, to the lower edge of the
Walls of the chest, and stretches across, separating chest
from abdomen, forming the floor of one and the roof of
the other. But it is not a. ﬂat ﬂoor. It arches up into the
chest, as may be seen in the ﬁgure, and is supported in
this position by the contents of the abdomen beneath it.
When We take a breath, the diaphragm contracts,-
being partly muscle,—:and the top of the arch is ﬂattened,
making more room in the chest. At the same time, the
contents of the abdomen are pressed down, and the Walls
of that cavity expand to accommodate them. The ab-
domen is not made larger when we take breath. It ex-

_ pands in front just enough to make up for what it loses

by the ﬂattening of its roof.

4. But the chest is enlarged, not only by the descent of
its ﬂoor, but also by the raising of the ribs and breast-
bone. The ribs are joined to the backbone behind, and
connected with the breast-bone by the costal cartilages,
which will bend. To the ribs are attached muscles which
pull them up, and others which pull them down. The
former are called inspiratory muscles, and the latter expir-
atory muscles. Now, clasp your hands, and extend your
arms in front of you, slanting a little downward. Your
hands represent a portion of the breast-bone, and your
armstwo of the ribs. Keeping your hands clasped, raise
your elbows as much as you can, and raise your hands a
little. That is the motion that the inspiratory muscles
give to the ribs and breast-bone. You can see that the
space included between them is enlarged in both direc-
tions. .

5. We have been speaking of the cavity of the chest.
The air enters. the lungs. But the lungs occupy almost

RESPIRA TION AND THE VOICE. 133

all of the chest, except the space ﬁlled by the heart.
They are attached to its Walls and floor. They are elas-
tic; and so, when the chest enlarges, the lungs enlarge
with it, and the air-cells open Wide. When the chest
sinks back to its former size, the elastic lung shrinks too;
and the air is driven out.

6. The lungs are held to the chest-Wall by the pleurae.
These are two empty, air-tight sacs, one for each lung.
One layer covers the lung; and the other lines the chest-
wall, and is attached to it. The insides of these two
sacs are moistened by a ﬂuid, so that there is no friction
between the lung and the chest: and, as the sacs are air-
tight, the layers can not be separated; and the chest-wall,
in its movements, pulls the lung with it, just as the circle
of Wet leather, which the boys call a sucker, lifts a stone.
The pleura is like the inner portion of the pericardium.

7. To recapitulate brieﬂy. The lungs, consisting largely
of little air-cells, with the air—tubes leading to them, are
elastic. ’They nearly ﬁll the chest, and cling closely to
its Walls and ﬂoor. When the chest expands by the de-
scent of its ﬂoor and the ascent of its walls, the lungs
expand with it. The air-cells open, and the outside air is
pushed in to ﬁll them,——-as the air enters a bellows when
we separate its walls. When the inspiratory muscles stop
pulling, the chest settles back to its former size, the expi-
ratory muscles helping it a little, and sometimes a good
deal.

8. VVe breathe without thinking of it in sleep as Well
as when awake. We can not refrain from it for many
seconds. Constant breathing is necessary to life, so it
must be independent of our wills.

134   THE’ HUMAN Boo Y.

CHANGES IN THE BLOOD.

SECTION V.——1. Part of the oxygen of each breath

taken in, after reaching the air-cells, goes through their  

walls, and through the walls of the capillaries outside of
them, into the blood. It joins itself to the red corpuscles;
and they ﬂoat on with it through the heart, and out into
the aorta, and ﬁnally into the capillaries of all parts of the
body: there it leaves the corpuscles, drawn by a more
powerful attraction through the capillary walls, to help
to nourish and build up the surrounding substance.

2. The blood, as it discharges its load of oxygen from
the capillaries, takes up, at the same place, a new load
of carbonic-acid gas. The oxygen is the nourishment for
the tissues,—the fuel for the ﬁre; and the carbonic-acid
gas is like the ash, which must be removed, or else the ﬁre
will be clogged. As the blood thus changes its load, a
marked change in its color takes place. As it comes from
the lungs, it is scarlet, and so continues through the heart
and arteries until it reaches the capillaries: there it turns
blue, and so continues through the veins and the heart
and the pulmonary artery until it reaches the lungs
again.

In the capillaries of the larger, or systemic, C’l’I‘C’bllCll’l0’)’L,
the blood turns blue.

In the capillaries of the lesser, or pulmonary, circulation,
the blood turns scarlet.

_ 3. We know that it is the oxygen taken in by the lungs
that gives blood its scarlet color, and that it is the loss of
oxygen in the tissues that makes it turn blue. For if we
take some blue blood from a vein, and shake it up in the
air, it will turn scarlet; and the color will be the same

RESPIRA TION AND THE VOICE. 135

when it contains much carbonic-acid gas as when it con-
tains little.

4. The blood is the common carrier of the nutriment
that We get from food and air; and it takes away, not only
carbonic-acid gas, but all other Waste matters. Some it
discharges by the kidneys, some by the skin; the car-

bonic-acid gas, chieﬂy by the lungs.

WASTE MATTERS GIVEN OFF BY THE LUNGS.——CHANGES
IN THE AIR.—VENTILATION.

SECTION VI.——1. The lungs, therefore, serve not only
to take in oxygen, but also to discharge carbonic-acid gas,
which is one of the chief Waste products of the body.

Another product of the Waste of the body, which is dis-
charged by the lungs, is water. This ordinarily passes
of in the breath as invisible vapor. But in very cold
weather it is condensed as it comes out, and we can see
it. It lodges and freezes on the beards of men, and on
the hair of animals. If the vapor in the breath of a man
is collected for twenty-four hours, and condensed to Water,
it measures as much as a pint.

2. The breath of man, and of every animal, When
breathed out, contains, besides carbonic-acid gas and
water, a very little of a certain substance which gives to
each its peculiar odor. The breath of a cow, for ex-
ample, has a smell peculiar to the animal. In pure,
fresh human breath, we do not recognize any odor; but
the substance is. present: and in ill—ventilated rooms,
Where many people have been breathing, it becomes
changed, and makes the air offensive and unhealthy.
These three substances—oXygen, carbonic-acid gas, and
an unnamed animal substance —— are always present in

186 i   THE IIUMA N 1201))’.

the breath. Other matters which give a distinct smell
are often found in it, but not constantly. - 
. .3. The amount of air in a single breath is about twenty
cubic inches, which would be a globe of air a little smaller
than a base-ball. We take about eighteen breaths in a
minute; in an hour, we breathe about twelve cubic feet of
air; and in a day, about three hundred. Since we breathe
more than eighteen times in a minute when we are exer-
cising actively, probably three hundred and ﬁfty feet
would be nearer the amount used in a day. This would
equal the entire contents of a room between seven and

eight feet on every side.
4. Every breath, as it comes from the mouth, is changed

‘ in four ways,—

1. Ithas lost oxygen.

2. It has gained carbonic-acid gas.

3. It has gainecl watery vapor.

4. It has gained a nameless animal substance.

This breath is not ﬁt to be breathed again. To be sure,
there is still oxygen in it, but not so much as in fresh air.
The loss of even one of the twenty-one parts in a hundred
of oxygen, which fresh air contains, makes air less sup-
porting; and if eleven parts are lost, though there are still
ten parts left, we could not live in it. Moreover, the
carbonic-acid gas has an injurious effect.

, 5. The stream of air which we pour out at each breath
does 11ot remain distinct, but mixes immediately with the
surrounding air, just as a glass of colored ﬂuid, if poured
into a pail of water, will quickly diffuse itself through the
whole. We never breathe precisely the same breath a
second time, and the air of a room only very gradually
becomes bad when many people are breathing in it. In

RESPIRATION AND THE VOICE. 137

a large room, such as a church, many people can remain
for a long time without suffering, even if the air is not
changed. They may not be aware that it is growing im-
pure, though one coming in from out of doors would know
it at once. If the room is small, the air must be constantly
changed, or they will be distressed. . »

6. The Black Hole, at Calcutta, was a room in which
one hundred and forty—siX men were conﬁned over night.
It was eighteen feet square, and had two small windows,
through which the air did not come freely. Their suffer-
ings were intense, and only twenty-three of them were
alive in the morning. T

7. Nothing is so free and abundant as fresh air; and yet

i we all suffer frequently, and many suffer constantly, for

want of it. We should always remember its importance.
It is possible to become accustomed to close rooms. We
may not know what is the cause of a drowsy head, a disin-
clination to exercise, and general ill health, while it is
simply lack of fresh air. Sleeping-rooms, in which we
spend a third of every day, unconscious of the state of
the air, should be well ventilated. t

8. It is very difficult to get fresh air enough into our
dwellings and public buildings, and, at the same time, to
avoid draughts, and keep warm. Ventilation is almost a
science by itself. There are many ways, but no one way
which will do for every room. But if we all bear in mind
the necessity of fresh air, and use our judgment and
ingenuity, we shall get it.

THE VOICE.

SECTION VII.-——1. The organs of breathing are, at the

same time, organs of voice. The larynx is especially the

138 THE’ HUMAN BOD Y.

voice-box; but the lungs, the bronchial tubes, the trachea,
and the throat, mouth, and nose, all have a part in mak-
ing and forming sounds.

2. The toy pipes, which have, near the mouth-piece,
narrow bands of brass, between which the air passes, and
which make a reedy sound, are some-
what like the organ of Voice. The
chest and lungs give the wind, the
trachea is the pipe, the larynx contains
the Vocal cords, which make the sound.
The larynx is divided in two parts by
a membranous partition, which has a
slit in it, running forward and back-
ward. This slit may be opened or
shut, or made longer or shorter, by the
action of many little muscles, which
surround it.

The edges of this slit, which is called
the glottis, are the Vocal cords. Every
A'f)’;,’:}“‘2’fY,;“r:;;;::Adam’s breath has to pass through it; but,

in ordinary breathing, no sound is
produced. If we wish to make a sound, the little mus-
cles tighten up the cords, and make the slit narrow; and,
as the lungs are squeezed in the chest, the air forced out
through the slit makes the cords vibrate. This makes
the sound. We shape this sound by changes in our
throats and mouths.

3. A reed-organ is somewhat like the Vocal apparatus;
but, in the instrument, there is a pipe for every note. The
windpipe can be so Varied in length and in size, and the
Voice-box, with its cords, can be so changed in many ways,
that a single pipe can make many different sounds.

RESPIRA TION AND THE VOICE. 139

4. The voice can be improved by cultivation. The

breathing-muscles grow stronger, and also the muscles of
the voice—box itself. The power to make ﬁrm, clear, sweet
sounds increases. It is by singing that this is sought.
But singing is not the only way of improving the vocal
powers. To speak Well is of more consequence than to
sing well. In singing, the sound is the main thing, and
less attention is paid to articulation. In speaking, it is
important, not only that the tones should be clear and
pleasing, but also that the pronunciation of words and
syllables and letters should be distinct and correct. By
taking care in speaking, We gradually train the muscles
of the tongue and cheeks and throat, by which we make

iwords, until it becomes a habit to speak well.

EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO.

SECTION VIII.—1. If more than a small amount of
alcohol is taken, it is cast out of the body unchanged.
One way in which it goes out is by the breath. The
breath of an habitual drinker always betrays him. It
contains, besides the vapor of water and carbonic-acid gas,

which are natural, the vapor of alcohol, which is unnat- '

ural. This is easily known by its odor, and is offensive.

2. Tobacco has a similar inﬂuence on the breath. Its
continuous use, even in moderate quantity, gives an odor
to the breath which is peculiar and disagreeable. While
fresh tobacco-smoke is not offensive to some who do not
use it, the stale fumes which cling to the persons and the
rooms of smokers are always unpleasant.

3. The bad effects of tobacco-smoke are increased when
it is drawn with the breath into the lungs. More of its
poisonous ingredients pass through the air—cells, and reach
the blood. '

CHAPTER IX.

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.

SECTION I.—1. An injury to the head, if violent
enough, will kill at once. If less violent, it will stun the
victim. He will drop, limp and helpless, and will know
nothing for a time; but his heart will: continue to beat
feebly, and he will still breathe. In time he will get his
senses, and his power over his muscles again.

2. An injury to the backbone, if violent enough, will
paralyze the lower limbs. The man is not stunned; and
he breathes, and his heart beats. He can move with all
the muscles above the injury: but those below are useless,
though they have not been hurt; and perhaps he will have
no feeling in those parts. In the case of the injury on
the head, the part that is hurt is the brain. In the case
of the injury on the back, the part that is hurt is the
spinal cord. I

3. The brain ﬁlls the chief cavity of the skull. It is
not one mass, but several masses joined together. The
largest mass is called the cerebrum. The next in size is
the cerebellum (little brain), which lies behind and beneath
the cerebrum. The pons Varolii is a mass in front of the
cerebellum and beneath the cerebrum. The medulla
oblongata is beneath the cerebellum, and behind the pons
Varolii.

4. Each of these masses is in two halves, which are
precisely alike. The two halves of the cerebrum and cere-
bellum are partly separate. The two halves of the pons
and the medulla are united.

5. The surface of the cerebrum and cerebellum, instead
of being smooth, is divided into ridges, with furrows be-
tween them. These ridges are called the covwolutions of

the brain. One great difference between the brain of man
and of the lower animals is, that it has more of these
convolutions. Very intelligent animals have more of
them than animals less intelligent.

6. The medulla oblongata is the lowest portion of the
brain. It is just above the great opening in the base of
the skull. Through that opening,it is continuous with
the spinal cord.

 7. The spinal cord occupies the spinal canal in the
backbone. ..It is about half an inch thick, and- eighteen

inches long. Before reaching the
lower end of the canal, it divides
i11to a bunch of ﬁne cords, which
make the cauda equina (horse’s
tail). .

The spinal cord, like the brain,
isipartly divided, lengthwise, into
two halves, which are alike.

8. Both the brain and spinal

cord have three coverings wrapped t

around them, called the m«emb9"ane8

s of the brain and cord.

From each half of the brain
twelve small cords come off, and
go out through holes in the skull.
From each half of the spinal cord
thirty-three small cords come off,
by two roots each, and go out of
the spinal canal through openings
between the vertebrae. These are
the nerves.

9. The substance of the brain

It is of two colors, white and gray.

If we should cut into the elbow to ﬁnd the “funny-
bone,” we would co1ne upon a ﬁat, shining cord about a11
eighth of an inch wide. If we should follow this cord
down, we would ﬁnd it divide into smaller cords; and, if
we should follow each one of these, we would see it ﬁnally
ending in the muscles, or in the skin, or some other tissue,
in a great many ﬁbers, so ﬁne that only a microscope
would show them. Many of them go to the little ﬁnger,
where the tingling is most felt. If we should search
farther for such cords, we would ﬁnd that they were in

a nearly every part. We would ﬁnd that some of them

were as large as the one ﬁrst seen, but that the smallest
were smaller than the capillary blood-vessels, and as

If we followed any other

nerves are cutoff, we shall
ﬁnd a great change in
the parts to which they
go. If all the nerves
going to a particular part
of the skin are cut off,
that part of the skin will
be insensible. You may
prick or pinch it, and it
will not feel. If all the

are out off, that muscle
will not obey your Will:
you can no longer use it.

DEFINITIONS.

SECTION I.—1. If ‘We wish to study a machine,,such
as a clock or a steam-engine, We take it to pieces, and ex-
amine each part separately. We inquire What each part
is called, what it is made of, and how it ﬁts in with the
other parts. We then ask what is the use of each part,
and how it Works. Knowing these things, We understand
the machine and its action.

2. The human body, which is the most wonderful of
all machines, is to be studied in this Way.

Anatomy names and describes its parts. It tells us
their size, Weight, shape, color, texture, and composition;
their position, and relation to other parts.  

Physiology acquaints us with the action of each part,
and the Work that it does. It tells us how it acts, when
it acts, What makes it act, and What is the effect of its
action.

Anatomy may be studied in the lifeless body.

Physiology must be studied in the living body.

Anatomy is Well known, because all the parts of the

body have been carefully studied and described.

does not commonly move of itself.
It is caused to move by something
in the nerve centers, and the nerve

is the road by which the inﬂuence

from the center that makes it move
gets to it.

3. The nervous system may be
compared to the telegraphic sys-
tem of a railroad. The nerves are
the Wires. The gray matter of the
spinal cord contains the ofﬁces of
the district superintendents. In
the cerebrum is the office of the
superintendent of the road. Sup-
pose a mosquito lights on your face,
and puts in his bill. He can not
put it in, small as it is, Without hit-
ting one or more little nerve ﬁbers.
Instantly a message goes along
those nerve ﬁbers, through the
nerve-trunks, through the spinal
cord, and ﬁnally to the general
superintendent’s ofﬁce. The mes-
sage is, “Something wrong here.”
Immediately an order is sent out,

along other nerve trunks and ﬁbers, to the muscles of the
shoulder and arm; and they contract, so as to strike the

mosquito.

4. This is done very quickly, and yet it takes some time.
The message goes in at the rate of one hundred and forty

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 149

feet ina second; it goes out at the rate of about ninety feet
in a second; and it takes a little time for the superintend-
ent to receive the message, and give theorder. Then it
takes time for the muscles to contract.

  If the mosquito is quick, he will escape you.

REFLEX ACTION.

5. In the night, the general superintendent’s office is
closed: the cerebrurn is asleep. And yet, if the foot is
pricked or tickled, it will be drawn up. A frog’s brain
may be taken out entirely, without killing him. If then
his side is pricked, he will scratch it with his foot. This
shows us that the general superintendent in the cerebrum

; does not do all the regulating of the body. There are

district superintendents in the spinal cord, and in the
medulla; and some matters are never sent up to the cen-
tral oﬂice at all. Digestion and respiration and circula-
tion are all regulated by district superintendents.

6. Such actions are called reﬂex actions; because the
message is sent in, and the order for the act “reﬂected ”
back, without any action of the will.

Winlcing is ordinarily a reﬂex act. The eye gets a
little dry. The message goes in along the nerve ﬁbers,
which end just beneath its surface; and the order comes
out to a muscle which brings the lids together, and spreads
moisture over the eye.

Coughing is a reﬂex act. Something tickles the throat,
or the air-passages below; and we can not help coughing.
The muscles of expiration combine to throw out the thing
that tickles.

Sneezing is a reﬂex act, for the purpose of clearing the
air-passages above the throat. All these acts are regulated
by centers below the cerebrum. T

150 THE HUMAN BODY.

7. Many actions which must, at ﬁrst, be attended to by
the cerebrum, may, after a time, be handed over to the
offices lower down. For example, in learning to play on
the piano, it is necessary, at ﬁrst, to give the Whole mind
to every touch. After a while, difﬁcult music can be
played with little thought.

‘If we were not made so that We could act in this Way,
our whole time and attention would be taken up in doing
the things which now seem the simplest. Our minds would
be Worn out in making the movements, and combinations
of movements, necessary in eating and breathing and
Walking.

8. The nerve-ﬁbers which carry messages in to the

. centers are called sensory ﬁbers. The nerve ﬁbers which

carry messages out to the muscles are called motor ﬁbers.

9. The messages do not all come from the outside, as in
the case of the mosquito-bite. A wish or thought may
start in the cerebrum, Without any impression from out-
side, and cause an order to be sent_out to the muscles.

10. The nervous system connects the diﬁ°erent parts of
the body, and makes them work together.

THE CEREBRUM THE SEAT OF THE HIGHER FACULTIES.

SECTION III.-——1. We have taken it for granted, that
the cerebrum is the seat of the higher faculties, ——the
memory, the reason, the will, the feelings. This is proved
in two ways : --

1. If this portion of the brain be diseased or injured,
these faculties are affected. . .

2. The more of the higher faculties an animal has, the
larger is the cerebrum in proportion to the rest of the
brain. Man has the largest cerebrum proportionally.

THE NER V0 US SYSTEM. 151

SECTION IV. —-1. We say that a person is nervous when
his nervous system is excited by triﬂing matters. Sick-
ness makes people nervous. Close rooms and bad air make
people nervous. Lack of exercise makes people nervous.
Indvlgestible food makes people nervous. The nervous
system will endure a great deal of Wear if rightly treated.
Lack of sleep, too much excitement, and anxiety, often
break it down. Worry is much more Wearing than
Work. Stimulants, which spur the nerves continually,
ﬁnally prostrate them.

2. Actions at ﬁrst done with care and thought, by being

. done frequently, are at length done Without effort. They

become partly reﬂex acts. That is the reason why a

a skilled workman can Work so much longer Without being

tired than a stronger man could, Who was not so skill-
ful. In this way good habits help us,— good habits of

position, of movement, of speech, of study. So bad habits '

make slaves of us. The habit of biting the nails is, in
many persons, a reﬂex act, which it is difficult to refrain
from, because it is done without thought.

3. The brain needs exercise just as truly as the muscles.
Study and thought not only make the brain strong and
clear: they help to keep it in good health.

EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.

SECTION V.—1. Alcoholic drinks are used chieﬂy for
their effects on the nerves and brain. They stimulate the

sense of taste in the tongue and palate, and they Warm the

stomach. Without really increasing strength, they give a
feeling of strength and conﬁdence. In moderate doses,
they excite the brain. The sensibilities become lively,
ideas ﬂow readily, Wit seems brighter, and philosophy

152   THE HUMAN BODY.

more profound. The nerves that control the muscles are
but little affected at this stage, and yet they are disturbed.
A very little wine may spoil the chances of a riﬂeman in
a shooting-match, or of a player in a game of ball.

2. As the amount of alcohol is increased, the higher
faculties of the mind grow dull, while the lower propensi-
ties are still further excited. That portion of the brain
which presides over the muscles loses its control. They
still act with force; but they have no guide, and they do
not act together. A drunken man can strike a hard blow,
but he can not hit straight. The muscles of his legs fail

i to combine their action. They are all at cross-purposes,

each contracting and relaxing without the direction of a

‘central power. The man’s movements become as tangled

as his thoughts.

3. Vanity and pugnacity are now aroused; recklessness
displaces caution; ﬁnally all self-control is lost, and the
lowest instincts rule. Ungoverned impulses lead to crime
and violence. The ﬁnal stage is the drunken sleep.

The course of events varies with different temperaments.
Some are but little excited, but gradually become stupid;
some never lose control of their limbs; some are good-
natured; and some uniformly morose. All are for the
time insane. ‘

4'. The after-effects of free indulgence in alcoholic drinks
are, an aching head, a foul stomach, unsteady nerves, and
depression of spirits.

Drinkers often reach a condition in which this depres-
sion is constant, except when they are under the inﬂuence
of liquor.

' The appetite in many cases grows by gratiﬁcation. It
becomes so strong that it is almost impossible to resist it:

THE NER V0 US SYSTEM. 153

conscience is powerless; ambition, pride, and self-respect
are abandoned. The most sacred affections are trampled
under foot to satisfy the thirst. This condition is disease,
but it is a disease for which the victim is himself re-
sponsible.

5. One of the most marked effects of alcohol is an en-
largement of the small blood-vessels. This is what makes
a toper’s face red. Not only in the face, but in other
parts, this enlargement takes place. Alcohol does it by
paralyzing the little nerves, which are the regulators of
the size of the vessels. These nerves constitute a very
delicate mechanism of Nature’s contriving, and it is im-
portant to the health of the body that it should not be

A interfered with.

6. Alcohol taken into the stomach is rapidly diffused

through the body by the blood. Various experiments ,

have proved that it accumulates especially in the brain.
In this delicate organ, it causes not only the temporary
effects already described, but permanent changes which
manifest themselves in various diseases. Among them
are epilepsy, paralysis, and insanity.

SUMMARY OF THE ACTION OF ALCOHOL ON THE BRAIN
AND NERVES.

7. 1. It first excites, and then paralyzes.

2. The higher faculties are the ﬁrst to be paralyzed,
leaving the man under control of his lower passions.

3. It obscures the senses, and impairs the judgment‘.

4. It exhausts the Whole nervous system, and leads to
paralysis, epilepsy, and insanity.

“CHAPTER X.
THE SKIN.

STRUCTURE OF THE SKIN.

SECTION I.—1. The skin is the covering of the body.
It is soft and smooth, but strong. It ﬁts perfectly; but it
stretches and glides a little on the muscles beneath, and,

i therefore, does not hinder our movements, as close-ﬁtting

garments do. It is partly transparent, and shows the

‘blue color of the veins, and the red of the arteries, beneath

it. i

It becomes quite thick in places where a thick covering
is needed, as on the palms of a laboring-man, or the soles
of a barefoot boy.  

2; If We prick a blister, a little Watery ﬂuid comes out,
and it ﬂattens down. It does not hurt to prick it, and it
draws no blood. So We ﬁnd that the top layer of the skin
has no nerves or blood-vessels. But, when We “scrape the
skin off,” We are hurt, and have a red, bleeding surface.
VVe do not often really scrape the skin off with triﬂing ac-
cidents; but We take off the top layer, and get down to the
deep layer, which contains both nerves and blood-vessels.

3. Dandrujf, which comes from the scalp, consists of
dry scales from the surface of the skin. From all of the
rest of the skin, little scales are constantly coming off.

cle and hairs of men and animals, with a microscope. A lens of one-inch

up, and ﬂow over on the surface. The tubes are like
springs, drawing their supply from
the blood-vessels beneath. It has
been estimated. that there are 2,500,-
000 of them altogether, and that, if
they were all joined in one tube, it
wouldbe ten miles long.

PERSPIRATION.

7. We do not see any moisture on
the surface when we are cool, but
there always is some pouring out
of the tubes. Ordinarily it changes

fast that it can not gather in drops.
But, when we are Very warm, it
wells up so rapidly that drops
appear; and these sometimes ﬂow in streams. If we
remain quiet in a cool place, we dry off; that is, the per-
spiration does not come so fast, and that which is already
on the surface is changed to Vapor, and carried away by
the air. 0

The moisture which is constantly coming from the
pores, but which we can not see, is called insensible per-
spiration. That which we can see and feel, as water, is
called sensible perspiration, or sweat.

8. Hairs grow from the skin. On most of the body
they are short and ﬁne. On the scalp and the face they
grow long. The hair which covers the bodies of the
lower animals is very useful in keeping them warm.

160 THE HUMAN BOD Y.

Man does not need it for this purpose, because he has
intelligence to clothe himself. The head and throat are,
however, protected in this
way. In Fig. 63, we see
the root of a hair as the
microscope shows it. It is
in the true skin, at the
bottom of a tube. To the
lower end of this tube, a
muscular ﬁber is attached,
which passes up to the

up the hair, and makes the
skin around it project, like a pimple. Cold makes these
ﬁbers contract: so does fear. It is in this way that the
hair “stands on end,” and that “ goose-ﬂesh ” is made.

SEBACEOUS GLANDS.

9. Opening into the tubes in which the hairs stand,
are other tubes, which come from little sacs, called seba-
ceous glands. These lie in the skin, by the side of the
hair-tubes. They manufacture an oily ﬂuid, which is
poured into the hair~tube, and out on the surface. It
keeps the skin soft, and gives a moist and glossy appears
ance to the hair. VVhen the scalp is unhealthy, and these
glands are not active, the hair becomes harsh and dull
and brittle.

V NAILS.

10. The nails, like the hairs, grow from the skin. They
are, indeed, a bit of the top layer, or cuticle, specially har-
dened. It is desirable that the ends of the fingers should

THE SKIN. 161

be ﬁrm for picking and touching; and, therefore, these
little stiff backs are made to grow in them. The roots of
the nail is the upper end beneath the skin. The matrix
is the bed on which it lies, and from which it grows. The
nail may be shed or torn out, and, if the matrix is sound,
anew nail will grow. If the whole matrix is destroyed,
there will be no new one. But a very small portion of
the matrix remaining, will produce a new nail, though it
may be an imperfect one.

USES OF THE SKIN.

11. Understanding the structure of the skin, we are
ready to notice its uses.

1. It protects the parts beneath. Being tough and
elastic, it can bear hard knocks. The cuticle, which is
without nerves, covers and guards the sensitive parts.
Neither ﬂuids nor gases pass through it easily. If the
skin is whole, we can safely put our hands in poisonous
ﬂuids, which would enter the blood, and do us harm, if it
were scratched.

2. It gives oﬁ” waste matters from the body. Perspira-
tion is chieﬂy water, but it contains some other substances
dissolved in it. The amount of water given off in a day
is different at different times and in different persons, but
is ordinarily about a quart. In this amount of water, two
or three spoonfuls of solid matter are dissolved.

T 3. It regulates the heat of the body.

BODILY HEAT.

12, Our bodies are always making heat; and yet, if we
put the bulb of a thermometer in the mouth of a healthy
man, it will never rise more than a degree or two above

162 THE HUMAN BODY.

98%° F. If it rises higher, he is sick, and has a fever.
Nor will it fall more than a degree or two below 98%° F.
In the stomach and in the blood, the thermometer would
mark about 100° F., never rising much above, or falling
much below. 100° F. is, then, the natural temperature
of the inside of man’s body. If he live under the tropi-

cal sun, it will not rise more than a degree or two above

this if he is well; and, if he live in Greenland, it will
not fall more than a degree or two below.

13. If we undertake to keep a room at a ﬁxed tempera-
ture, we must have a ﬁre to warm it; and we must have
means of cooling it if it is too warm. The human body
has its ﬁre, and it has its cooling-apparatus; and this

‘heating and cooling apparatus is self -regulating, and

works so perfectly, that, throughout a long life, in heat
and in cold, the inward temperature never varies more
than two or three degrees in health.

‘ HOW THE HEAT IS MADE EQUAL IN ALL PARTS.

14. The ﬁre is not in any one part, but in all parts. In
every particle, the changes which take place, as the parti-
cle takes up oxygen from the blood, and gives out car-
bonic acid, make heat, as the changes which take place in
the coal or wood in the stove make heat. This heat is
given to the blood. It is warmer when it comes from
the capillaries, where it has been in close contact withrthe
particles; and the blood, now divided in a thousand little
streams, and again united in one stream, at the heart,
diffuses the heat through the body.

15. Suppose the feet, for example, to be more exposed
to cold than other parts. The blood in the feet might be,
for a very short time, colder than the rest of the body;

I

THE SKIN. 163

but that blood immediately passes upward, and is warmed
by the warmer stream above, with which it is mixed. A
fresh supply of Warm blood comes down, and contributes
its heat to the feet. They are enabled in this way to
maintain nearly the same heat as the rest of the body.

On the other hand, suppose the brain or the stomach,
While they are especially busy, to groW hotter than the
rest of the body. Their heated blood is soon mingled with
the general stream; and, while it helps to heat the rest, is
itself cooled. The heated parts are cooled by the cooler
blood coming from other parts. So, by the constant cir-
culation of the blood, the heat of all parts is made nearly
equal.

16. The air is ordinarily cooler than the body, and is
constantly taking heat from it. Clothing keeps us from
losing heat too fast. Furs and Woolens have no Warmth
in themselves. They only keep off the cold air, and keep
in thepheat that the body makes. Besides this, in cold

Weather, We warm the air by ﬁres.

If we are much out of doors in cold weather, two things

help us to keep Warm : ——

1. We eat more, and so furnish more fuel to our inter-
nal ﬁres. We also get more oxygen in each breath, and
this is fuel too. a

2. We exercise more, and that keeps these internal ﬁres
more active. '

In these Ways, more heat is made; and We can afford to
lose more. ~
HOW THE BODY IS COOLED.

17. Sometimes there is too much heat in our bodies,
as when we are exercising, or in the sun. It will not go
off into the air fast enough, even if we are lightly clothed.

164 THE- HUMAN BOD Y.

In that case, the skin becomes a cooling-apparatus. It
works in two ways : — ~

1. The deep layer of the skin is full of small blood-
vessels. The effect of heat is to make these blood-vessels
grow larger. The blood, then, ﬂows into them, away from
the deeper vessels. That is the reason your face gets red
when you are heated. VVhile the blood is in these vessels
of the skin, it grows cool much faster than it does when it
is deep in the body. It is nearer the cool air. The skin,
then, receives more blood when we are heated, and spreads
it out in a thin layer near the surface, and so cools it. By
cooling the blood, the whole body is cooled.

2. The two or three million sweat-‘glands do a most

' important part of the regulation of the heat of the body.

In cities, water-carts go about in hot Weather sprinkling
the streets. This lays the dust, and cools the air. Much
of the sprinkled water evaporates as it touches the warm
stones; and, wherever water evaporates, it makes things
around it a little cooler. The sweat-glands form a great
watering-apparatus for the surface of the skin. The per-
spiration evaporates; and the skin, and the blood in it, are
cooled. The hotter it is, the more we perspire; and, the
more we perspire, the more heat is taken away. Men can
stay for a time in a temperature of 200° F., and even more
if they perspire freely. If perspiration is checked, they
can not easily endure even a moderate heat. The‘ reason
why we suffer more from heat in what we call a “ sticky
day” in summer, is that the air is moist, and does not take
up the moisture from the skin so fast as drier air would.
Our bodies are wet, and evaporation goes on slowly.

SUGGESTION TO TEACHERS.--ShOW the cooling effect of evaporation by
throwing a spray of alcohol or ether on the hand, with an atomizer.

CARE OF THE SKIN.

SECTION II.—1. If the skin of an animal is covered
with Varnish, it Will soon die. If more than half of the
surface of the skin is burned, even though the burn be
not very deep, death will probably be the result. This
shows how important the action of the skin is. It should
be Well taken care of. V

2. To keep the skin healthy, three things are needed : —

1. To keep the glands (sweat-glands and sebaceous
glands) open and active.

2. To keep the blood circulating, freely in it.

3. To let the air get to it.

3. The solid matter in the perspiration, the oily matter

from the sebaceous glands, and dead scales from the sur-

face, together with dirt, will form a thin coating, which
clogs the pores, and is itself unwholesome.
The skin of a savage is freely exposed to air. The

‘civilized man, stepping from a Warm bed into warm

clothing, and staying, perhaps, much of his time in close
rooms, gets a soft, over-sensitive skin. Neither its glands
nor its blood-Vessels are vigorous, and it can not do its
Work well.

4. Besides, such a man is liable to colds. A cold gen-
erally comes from chilling some portion of the skin.
Those who are out of doors in all weather do not often
catch cold. Their skin, as Well as the rest of the body,
can better resist a chill. Those Who are seldom exposed
to cold air, and whose skin has become delicate, catch
cold most readily.

5. Too thick clothing keeps air from the skin, and
weakens it by keeping it too Warm. Air-baths are useful.

166 THE’ II UMAN B01) 1'.

6. People who are sick or in pain, often receive great
relief and comfort from having the skin rubbed; and
it not only relieves, but, when thoroughly and perse-
veringly done, it helps to cure many diseases. It is good
for well people also. Thorough friction of the Whole
body with a brush or a dry towel every morning, is the
next best thing to a daily bath. It exercises the muscles
of the skin. It brings the blood into it. It removes the
accumulations of dead cuticle and perspiration.

7. No other one thing is so important for the health of
the skin as bathing. It is possible for a delicate person
to bathe too much, and imprudent bathing is sometimes
hurtful. But, practiced with discretion, it is of great ad-
vantage. True, very many people enjoy good health who
never bathe. But it seems unnecessary to argue, that to
keep the skin clean, the pores open, the glands active, and
the circulation free, by Water and rubbing combined, must
make the skin, and therefore the Whole body, more healthy.

T 8. Cold water is a natural stimulant of the skin. The
slight shock that it gives to the nervous system rouses the
Whole body to greater activity. Salt-water bathing is
more invigorating than fresh-Water bathing, because the
salt has a direct, stimulating effect of its own.

9. There is no other safeguard against colds so good as
a daily bath. We take cold because the skin is sensitive
and delicate, and will not bear exposure to the damp or
chilly air. By regular bathing, it is made vigorous, the
blood ﬂows freely through it, and its nerves are strength-
ened, so that We do not get chilled.

For that very common affection, catarrh, cold Water,
used freely and regularly on the skin, is an excellent
remedy. . .

THE SKIN. 167

10. Certain cautions are to be observed in bathing : —
1. Never bathe directly after a full meal. The blood

is then directed to the stomach, and active Work is

going on there. Other organs are relaxed. The bath

will hinder digestion, and sometimes cause an injurious  

shock. a T

2. Never bathe in cold Water when the system is greatly
exhausted. Very delicate persons should not bathe in
cold water at all.

3. Be very cautious about bathing in cold Water when
heated, especially if you are at the same time tired.

4. Never stay in the water until you are chilled, so
that you do not get Warm soon on coming out, or until
you -feel languid and Weak instead of feeling refreshed.

Great injury sometimes results
from neglect of these rules.

made chiefly of cartilage. There are three little muscles
attached to the external ear, and some people can move
it. Most people can not.

3. The tube is called the external auditory canal. It
is an inch long, and ends at the membrane of the tym-
panum.

4. The membraine of the tympanum, or drum-head, sepa~
rates the middle from the external ear. The cavity of
the middle ear is called the tympanum, or drum. It con-
tains the small bones of the ear. It is connected With
the back part of the throat by a tube, called the Eustachian
tube.

5. The internal ear is beyond the middle ear, deep in a

bone of the skull. In it are the endings of the nerve of

hearing.
HOW WE HEAR.

6. Sound is a vibration which can be perceived by
the ear. Commonly as it reaches the ear it is a vibra-

~ tion of the air. The Waves of
air enter the external auditory
canal, and strike the drum-
head. They make the drum-
head vibrate.

7. Across the cavity of the
drum, from the drum-head to
the opposite wall, the three
BONES or THE LEFT EAR, SEEN ‘ little bOI1€S Of the ear —‘the

 “ hammer,” the “ and
the “stirrup ” — are stretched
in a chain. The ‘hammer is joined to the drum-head

 

« and to the anvil, and the anvil to the stirrup.

8. VVhen the drum-membrane vibrates, these little bones

THE’ SKIN. ’ ‘ 169

are made to vibrate. The last one in the chain, the stirrup,
is joined to a small membrane in the inner Wall of the
drum, Which is like a little drum-head. On the other side
of this little drum-head is the inner ear, which is ﬁlled
with Water. As the stirrup vibrates, it sets the little
drum-head Vibrating; and that makes the Water in the
inner ear Vibrate, and the little Waves strike the ends of
the nerve of hearing, and by it the impression is carried

  in to the brain.

9. It is not the ear that hears. It is the brain that
hears by means of’ the ear.

7. b An ear-ache is commonly caused by inﬂammation of
the lining of the drum. It swells, and discharges a ﬂuid
that ﬁlls the cavity, and makes pain by pressure. Some-
times, as the inﬂammation subsides, the ﬂuid is absorbed.
Sometimes the drum-membrane bursts, and lets out the
ﬂuid; and the pain stops. A discharge from the ear com-

monly comes from an inﬂamed middle ear through a hole

in the drum-head. If the hole islsmall, it may heal up
when the discharge stops. If a large part of the drum-
membrane is gone, it Will not heal up.

8. The loss of the drum-head does not destroy the hear-
ing, but it impairs it.   p

9. Ear-wax is made by glands in the skin lining the
auditory canal. It is not a safe practice to dig it out with
hair-pins or other instruments. Ear-Wax is necessary to
keep the canal and drum-head soft and moist, and it will
take care of itself. If it forms hard lumps, and stops the
ear, as it sometimes does, itpmay be removed by syringing
with warm water. N oone but a physician should put in
any instrument.

 

170 ‘ THE HUMAN BODY.

THE EYE.

SECTION IV.-——1. The cavities in the skull which con-
tain the eyes are called the orbits. They are shaped like
pyramids, pointing inward,
and are about an inch and
a half deep. At the bottom
 of the orbits are holes,
‘A through which the nerves
of the eye —-— the optic nerves
—enter them. In the inner
side of the orbits are open-
ings into a canal, called the
lachrymal canal, Which runs
, straight down into the nose.
2. The orbit is lined with fat, which makes a soft
cushion (for the eyeball. The eyeball is nearly round,
and about an inch in diameter. It is attached to the
optic nerve behind, as to a stem.

. 3. The outer coat of the eyeball is White and tough.
It is called the sclerotic coat. A transparent circle, like a
Watch-glass, is set into this in front. It is called the
cornea.

4. The cavity of the eyeball is divided into two cham-

bers by the lens. The chamber behind the lens is ﬁlled
With a jelly-like ﬂuid, called the vitreous humor. The
chamber before the lens is ﬁlled with a Watery ﬂuid, called
the aqueous humor.

The optic nerve goes to the interior of the ball, and
spreads out, by dividing up into ﬁne threads, to line the
back part. This lining is the retina.

5. Looking through the transparent cornea, we see the
iris, the colored part. It is Very smooth and beautiful.
It is made partly of muscle ﬁbers, c
of the kind not subject to the will.
Some of them form circles around
its center: others run from center
to edge, like the spokes of a Wheel.
When these latter ﬁbers contract,
the hole in the center, called the
pupil, grows large. When the cir-
cular ﬁbers contract, the pupil
grows small. The iris is a cur-

6. The lids have each a thin  

plate of cartilage in them, to make them ﬁrm. The inside
of each lid. and the surface of the eye are covered with a
mucous membrane, called the conjunctiva. The hairs
(eyelashes) which grow from their edges help to protect the
eye from dust and perspiration. Little sebaceous glands,
called ]VIe'lb0m7Ia,n glands, lie under the lining of the lids,
and open on their edges. They oil the eyelashes and
the edges of the lids. Under the roof of the outer part
of the orbit, resting upon the eye—ball, is the tear-gland
(lachrymal gland). About a dozen little ducts from it open

172 THE HUM/1N...BOD Y.

on the surface of the eye. This gland furnishes the
moisture which the eye requires.
By winking, the moisture is
 spread over the surface.

7. Ordinarily moisture is sup-
plied only as fast as it is needed,
and it all evaporates. In strong
feelings of sorrow or joy, moist-
ure is poured out Very rapidly,
and gathers i11 tears. Near the

l\ inner angle of the eye, an open-
ing, apparently about as large
as a needle, can be seen on the

lens is like the glass lens in the end of the tube. The
lining of the cavity of the eye-ball is colored dark, like
the inside of the box of the camera. The retina is like
the sensitive -plate which the photographer puts in just
before he takes the picture. The brain behind the eye
is represented by the photographer himself looking
through from behind his instrument.

10. When We look at an object, a picture of it is made
on the retina. This picture can be seen by a skillful ob-
server looking into the eye with an instrument called an
ophthalmoscope. It may be seen by looking from behind
through an eye taken from an animal just killed, as the
photographer looks through his camera.

The retina, which is the ending of the optic nerve,
carries in to the brain the impression which makes the
picture. It is not the eye that sees. If the optic nerve is
cut off, we do not see; although a picture will still be
formed on the retina as before. It is the brain that sees.
The eye is its instrument.

CAUSES OF TROUBLE IN THE EYE.

11. The eye is sometimes weak, and gets very tired
and sore by use, simply because the whole body is Weak.
But generally when there is redness, swelling, or pain in
the eye, there is something Wrong in itself. It may be
that the delicate lining of the lids, the conjunctiva, is
inflamed, just as the lining, of the throat is inﬂamed at
times. The lids then feel rough, as if there were sand
under them. Q

Too LONG SIGHT.

12. One of the commonest causes of aching eyes and
head, after reading, is too long sight. When we look at a

174 THE II UMAN 1301);’.

near object, the shape of the lens is changed a little by
an effort of the eye. Too long-sighted eyes have to
make more effort to do this than eyes with natural sight.
The strain tires and irritates them, and may make them
very Weak. This trouble can be entirely relieved by

glasses.
TOO SHORT SIGHT.

13. Short-sighted persons do not commonly have ach-
ing and inﬂamed eyes. Their eyes do not have to make
the effort that those of long-sighted people do to see
near objects. Reading does not tire them. But short-

T sightedness is liable to increase. It makes the vision of
every thing more than a few feet away indistinct. It may

be remedied by glasses, but they are an inconvenient
necessity.

14. Too short sight is very commonamong students.
It is found, that, when children begin to goto school, few
of them are short—sighted. In each higher class, there are
more short-sighted pupils; and the number increases so
fast, that we infer that there is something in the habits
of school—childrcn that makes them short—sighted.

CAUSES OF TOO SHORT SIGHT.

15. If we inquire what this cause of short sight is, we
ﬁnd that it is not any one thing, but many things. Every
thing that tires and strains the eyes of scl1ool—children,
tends to make them sliort—sighted.

Causes of short sight are,——

1. Too 1nucl1 use of‘ the eyes.

2. Bad light.

3. *Wrong positions when reading.

THE SKIN. I75

CARE OF THE EYES.

16. 1. If the eyes are tired and hot, it is a sign that
they have been used too lo11g. Stop until they are rested.

2. Do not try to read when there is not light enough.
If the light is dim, the book will be held too near the eyes.
This tires them, and causes short sight. Reading by a
fading twiilzyht is particularly bad.

3. The light should not be too ylairiny. If it is, the
nerve is stimulated too much. This tires it. Besides,
when any nerve is over-stimulated, it loses its sensitiveness

after a time; and then the book will be held too near, and

short-sightedness may result.
For the same reason, the light should, if possible, fall
over the left shoulder on the page. Then it will not be

. all reﬂected into the eyes, as when it comes from in front.’

4. The light should be steady. A ﬂickeringlight keeps
the eye annoyed, and tires it with constant changes.

5. The book and the eye should be steady. It is as
Wearisome to the eye to have the page or the head in con-
stant motion as to have the light ﬂicker. Reading in the
cars is trying to the eyes.

6. The upright position is the natural and easy one for
the eyes. To read when lying down, or with the head
hanging over the book, tries the eyes, and tends to short-
sightedness.

7. Any serious trouble with the eyes should be attended

to at once. It is better never to open a book than to lose
the use of the eyes. If study can not be continued_with-
out ruining the eyes, abandon study.

176 THE HUMAN BODY.

COLOR-BLINDNESS.

17. Not a feW people are color—blind. Some can not
distinguish any colors. Others can not recognize a par-
ticular color, as red or blue, confounding it with other
colors. If a person is color-blind, it is very desirable to
know it. An engineer on a railroad, who could not tell a
red light from a green one, would be a dangerous person.

EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND NARCOTICS.

SECTION V.—1. A clear eye and a good complexion
are tokens of health. When the blood is impure, the
skin loses its fresh and delicate appearance. Indulgence
in" alcoholic drinks ﬂushes the face, and often marks it
with blotches and pimples. Narcotics give a sallow hue
to the skin.

A blear eye is a characteristic mark of a toper. ‘‘Who '

hath redness of eyes ? They that tarry long at the Wine.”

The structure of the eye and the ear illustrate the
delicacy and nice adaptation of our bodies. VVe are
Wonderfully made, and it is crime as Well as folly to blunt
our ﬁner perceptions, and abuse our variousorgans, by
narcotics or alcoholic stimulants. We should rather
cherish and cultivate them by obedience to every law
of health, that they may be, as they were designed to be,
the servants and instruments of our higher nature.

APPENDIX.

"WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF ACCIDENT.

  IT is natural to be alarmed when an accident occurs. Our
feelings of sympathy for the sufferer, and perhaps of fear

C that he will die, agitate us, and scatter our wits, and make us

helpless. The ﬁrst thing at such a time, is to think. “What

can I do?" is the question. To apply the mind vigorously V

to that question, is the best Way to control the feelings.

VV e can not anticipate all the particulars of accidents that
may happen, but we can ﬁx in the mind a few simple direc-
tions for each kind.

Fainting. — When a person faints, the heart almost stops
heating. The face is deadly pale. If we could  the brain,
we should see that pale too. Because the blood is not sent to
it in suﬁicient amount, it partly stops acting, and the person
is unconscious.

Place him on his back, with his head low. The blood will
flow to the brain more easily in the horizontal than in the
upright position.

Give him air. Perhaps he has fainted because the air is
bad. Fresh air will revive him.

Sprinkle cold water on the face. It stimulates and rouses

the nerves.
181

182 A PPENDIX.

Loosen the clothing about the neck and Waist, so that it may

be easy to breathe.

A fainting-ﬁt generally lasts only a short time.

Fits. —-In fainting, the face is pale, the pulse can hardly be
felt, the limbs are limp and still. In fits, the face may be pale
or red, the pulse can be felt easily, and the limbs often jerk
and draw up spasmodically. Frothing at the mouth is not
uncommon. If the ﬁt is a long one, or if several come in
succession, there will be time for the doctor to arrive. What
you can do, is,——-  

1. To keep the person from hurt~z'ng himself in his struggles.

2. To give him plenty of air.

3. To see that there is notlzing tight around his neck or chest.

4. Place him with his head ralsedsa little.

5. When he comes out of the fit, let him rest.

Sunstroke.--This happens to those who have been ex-
posed to great heat, either in the sunshine or in the shade.
The face is ﬂushed or pale, the pulse quick, and the skin dry
and hot.

Put the sufferer in  cool a place as possible, with his head
raised, and apply cold water or ‘ice to his head and chest. If
he seems extremely weak, and the skin becomes cool, stop
using ice, and put mustard and water on his feet and on the
back of his neck. ' T

Shock. —-Shock is the name given to the condition of pros-
tration which sometimes follows a severe injury. The person
is conscious, but extremely weak. The face is pale, the skin
cool, and perhaps moist, the pulse quick and small, and there
is restlessness. The powers may continue to fail until death
comes. More frequently they rally after atime.

A person in this condition must be handled very carefully.

-Any, roughness, may quench thecspark of life. He must be

laid down with his head low. Nature must be aided by

.A.PPENDIX. 183

gentle stimulants. Heat is one of the best stimulants. Put
hot-water bottles at his feet and sides. Give air, but avoid
chilling him. Do not move him until he is better.

Fractures and Dislocations. ——A broken or dislocated
limb is generally helpless. Even when there is no pain in
it, it can not be used. If there is reason for thinking that
such an accident has happened, the limb should be seen
immediately by a doctor. In the mean time keep it per-
fectly quiet. Do not allow the patient to attempt to use it.
Support it in the position in which it is most comfortable.
Bathe it in cold or hot water to relieve pain and keep down

swelling.

B1eeding.—-When blood is ﬂowing from a wound, it must

i be stopped. In most cases it is only necessary to press a

handkerchief on it. This will check the ﬂow so that the

blood can coagulate in the vessels. Sometimes it is neces- ,

sary to press hard upon the wound for a good while. Some-
times this will not be sufficient. The blood is ﬂowing, perhaps,
from a large artery. Then a bandage must be drawn tight
around the limb above the wound. If the bleeding stops, the
bandage may be taken off in half an hour. If the bleeding
does not stop, it is, perhaps, coming from a vein; and a band-
age must be tied around the limb below the wound. It may
be necessary to find the course of the bleeding vessel, and press
on it with the thumb. In some of these ways,external bleed-
ing can always be checked for the time.

Bleeding from the No.s*e.—I..et the person keep upright, and
hold his hands above his head. Apply cold to the back of
the neck and to the forehead. Press on the nostrils. Push a
little wad of cotton into the nostrils. .

Bleeding from the .Lu/ngs or Stomach or B0wels.—Keep the
patient perfectly quiet on his back. Do not let him talk‘.
Give him ice to swallow, and salt and water.

184 APPENDIX.

Poisoning.—~If the poison has not been in the stomach
more than an hour or two, try to make the patient vomit.
This can sometimes be done by tickling the throat with the
ﬁnger or a feather. If this is not sufficient, give a teaspoonful

‘of mustard in a tumbler of lukewarm water. Or give a
dose of ipecac. If the poison is causing pain in the stomach,

give the whites of two or three eggs. If the poison is an acid
(as sulphuric acid), give soapsuds or magnesia. If the poison
is a narcotic, like opium or belladonna or chloral, keep the
person from going to sleep.

Drowning. —VV hen a person, apparently drowned, is taken
out of the water, his lungs have water in them, and his throat
is stopped with water and mucus. Turn him on his face, and

_let the water run out of his mouth. Thrust your ﬁnger in

his mouth, and clear it, and draw his tongue forward. Then
lay him on his back, with a folded coat under his shoulders,
raising them a little higher than his head. Tickle his nostrils
with a feather. Give a little snuff, or a smell of smelling-
salts. This may start his breathing. If it does not, try to
make his chest expand and contract as it does naturally. A
good way to do this is to stand across his body, or above his
head, take hold of his arms, and bring his elbows up to the
sides of his head. This opens the chest and lungs, and imi-
tates the movement of inspiration.. Then bring his arms
down to his sides, and press them against the walls of the
chest. This contracts the chest and lungs, and imitates the
movement of expiration. Do this ﬁfteen or twenty times in
a minute for half’ an hour, if the chest does not begin to open
and contract of itself in less time. At the same time, let
others get off the wet clothing, and cover with dry. Let them
rub. the limbs vigorously, rubbing from the extremity toward
the center. If bottles of hot water, or hot bricks or hot _flan-
nels, can be had, put them at his feet and sides. The three
things to be aimed at, are,-— T

APPENDIX. 185

1. To start the movements of breathing.

2. To restore Warmth.

3. To quicken the current of blood.

Persevering and energetic efforts will often be rewarded by
a return of the signs of life when they seemed to have gone
forever.

Remember that “a little knowledge is a dangerous thing”
if it leads to undue self—conﬁdenee. In case of serious ac-
cident, never fail to get help if possible from some one more
experienced and capable than yourself.

GLOSSARY.

THE BONES AND JOINTS. 17

CHAPTER II.

THE BONES AND JOINTS.

SECTION I.—1. The bones are the framework of the
body. When joined, as in the living man, they constitute
the skeleton. They serve three purposes :—

1. They give the body shape and ﬁrmness of outline.
The soft parts which cover them add grace.

2. They act as levers by which the muscles attached

‘ to them move the body. "

3. They protect important organs.

, 2. There are two main cavities in the body formed
wholly or in part by the skeleton; viz., -—

SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.—-1. Every school in which anatomy and
physiology are taught ought, if possible, to have a human skeleton. Lack-
ing this, the next best thing is to have the skeleton of some quadruped.
The general resemblance will be suiﬁcient to make it a good illustration of
the text. If you have no complete skeleton, get dried bones,— beef-bones,
mutton-bones, vertebrze, long bones, jaw-bones. Have them sawed in dif-
ferent directions. Much can be learned from them. The differences be-
tween dried bone and fresh, living bone must, however, be borne in mind.
The experiments of softening a bone by maceration in wea.k hydrochloric
acid for a few weeks, and of removing the animal matter by burning, are
easily tried.

2. The different parts of a joint can be shown in a sheep’s leg.

SESSION OF 1885.

AN ACT _

Relating to the study of Physiology and Hygiene in the
public schools of the Commonwealth, and educational institutions re-
ceiving aid from the Commonwealth.

SECTION 1. Be it enacted, by the Senate and House of‘ Represent-
atives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in General Assembly met,
and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, that physiology
and hygiene, which, in each division of the subject so pursued, shall
include special reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks, stimulants,
and narcotics, upon the human system, shall be included in the branches
of study now required by law to be taught in the common schools, and
shall‘ be introduced and studied as a regular branch, by all pupils in all
the departments of the public schools of the Commonwealth, and ‘in all
educational institutions supported wholly or in part by money from the
Commonwealth. - .

SECTION 2. It shall -be; the duty of county, city and borough super-
intendents, and boards‘ of allgeducational institutions receiving aidfrom

- the Commonwealth, to reportiiftixq the Superintendent of Public Instruc-

tion, any failure or neglect onilthe part of boards of school directors,
boards of school controllers, boards of education, and boards of all edu-
cational institutions receiving aid from the Commonwealth, to make

proper provision in any and all of the schools or districts under their

jurisdiction, for instruction in physiology and hygiene, which, in
each division of the subject so pursued, gives special reference to the
effects of alcoholic drinks, stimulants, and narcotics, upon the human
system, as required by this act; and such failures on the part of direct-
ors, controllers, boards of education, and boards of educational insti-
tutions, receiving money from the Commonwealth, thus reported, or
otherwise satisfactorily proven, shall be deemed suﬂicient cause for with-
holding the warrant for State appropriation of school money, to which
such district or educational institution would otherwise be entitled.

SECTION 3. No certiﬁcate shall be granted any person to teach - in
the public schools of the Commonwealth, or in any of the educational
institutions receiving money from the Commonwealth, after the ﬁrst
Monday of June, Anno Domini one thousand eight hundred and eighty-

six, who has not passed a satisfactory examination in physiology and .

hygiene, with special reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks, stim-
ulants, and narcotics, upon the human system.

SECTION 4. All laws, or parts" of laws, inconsistent with the pro-
visions of this act, are hereby repealed. ’

out. The great opening at the base of the skull connects
its cavity with the spinal canal, and is fully a.n inch in
diameter. The other openings are very much smaller
than this. g _

The spinal canal is also well guarded by its walls, and
by bony projections. It contains the spinal cord.

2. The cavity of the trunk. This is divided by a
horizontal partition, called the diaphragm, into two parts.
The upper part is the thorax, or chest; and the lower, the
abdomen and pelvis.

The thorax is a bony cage formed by the backbone

y behind, the ribs at the side, and the breast-bone in front.

It contains the heart and lungs. These organs need to

"be guarded against blows or pressure, but they are not so

easily injured in this Way as the brain and spinal cord.
The thorax is, therefore, not so close a box as the skull.
Moreover, it is needful that the walls of the thorax should
be movable in order that we may breathe. The thorax
is so made that it gives suﬂicient protection to the organs
which it contains, and at the same time it can enlarge
and contract. .

The abdomen is not as well guarded as the thorax.
There is no bony wall in front; and the intestines are
easily wounded, though they bear pressure and displace-
ment much better than the heart and lungs. But if the
abdomen were walled in front, like the thorax, we could
not bend our bodies. For purposes of motion, and to
permit the expansion of the intestines after a full meal,
they are left partially unprotected.

The pelvis (Latin, pelm}s,a basin) is formed by the hip-
bones and the sacrum and coccyx. Its contents are Well
guarded by those thick bones.

joined in position, the arches to-
gether constitute the spinal canal,
and the bodies form a solid col-
umn for support. Between the
bodies are cushions of a tough and
elastic substance called ﬁbro-car-
tilage. Each is about one-fourth
of an inch thick, and is ﬁrmly
united to the bone above and
below. They serve as springs in
the column, and allow a twisting
motion.

The sacrum is a wedge-shaped

The coccyx is the end of the column, and is a small,
curved bone, commonly in two or more pieces, which are

united by joints.

3. The spine in a baby is perfectly straight, and his
back ﬂat. As he grows and walks the spine becomes
slightly curved backward in the region of the shoulder-
blades, and forward at the waist. This is natural. But
frequently the curve of the back becomes too great. The
shoulders are drawn forward, and the chest ﬂattened.
This makes a stoop. It is caused by weakness of the
muscles which sustain the back and head, or indolence
and carelessness. It makes an ungraceful shape, and is
injurious because it compresses the heart and lungs, and
checks their free action. An erect posture and a full
chest should be cultivated. To this end,-the muscles of
the chest and trunk must be kept Vigorous by exercise.

Fig. 5. THE THORAX.

The natural curves of the spine are forward and back-
ward. A curve to one side is unnatural and a deformity.
It comes from bodily weakness, lack of air and exercise,

22 THE HUMAN 1:01) Y.

and from standing on one foot habitually, or sitting much
of the time at a desk or table with one arm resting upon
it While the other hangs down.

4. The ribs and breast-bone with the backbone form the
thorax. The ribs are twenty-four in number, twelve on
each side. They are joined to the backbone behind. The
ﬁrst seven are called true ribs. They are connected with
the breast—bone by the costal cartilages. The last five are
called false ribs. They are not directly connected with the
breast-bone. The last two false ribs are called ﬂoating-ribs,
because their front ends are not joined to any bone.

The costal cartilages are contin uations of the ribs.

Cartilage is more elastic than bone, and the wall of the

thorax expands and contracts 1n_ore freely for being partly
cartilage. It is by this expansion and contraction that we
breathe. Whoever has harnessed horses has
noticed that they generally swell their chests,
and manifest displeasure, when the girths are
buckled tight. It interferes with their breath-
ing, and so with their comfort. If we are wise
we shall resist, as they do, any compression of
our chests or waists by tight clothing. The
elastic walls readily yield to pressure, and after
a time become permanently misshapen. The
heart and lungs are then crowded; and the
liver is displaced, and encroaches on the other
~ organs. Thus, a ﬁgure is acquired which is
neither beautiful nor healthful.

5. The sternum, or breast-bone, is a ﬂat, nar-
row bone, about ﬁve inches long, which is in the middle
line of the chest in front. The collar-bones and the car-
tilages of the ribs are joined to it.

6. The hyoid bone is a slender bone shaped like a
horseshoe. It is situated in the neck just above Adan1’s
apple, where it may easily be felt. The base of the tongue

4. The arm-bone is called the humerus. It is a strong
bone, about a foot long in a grown man. It
has a round head, which plays on the joint
surface in the shoulder-blade. Its lower end
is joined to the two bones of the fore—arm.

5. The bones of the fore—arm are called
the radius and the ulna. The
radius is on the thumb side,
'_.‘ and the ulna on the side of
l the little ﬁnger. The radius
T I is joined to the humerus and
 to the ulna in such a Way that

 turns the palm of the hand

  so joined to the humerus that

8. The ﬁ'Ve metacarpal bones are slightly curved, so as
to make a hollow in the palm. T

The phalanges are in three rows, and are so called be-
cause they are like rows of soldiers
(Greek, phalanx, a body of soldiers).

The thumb stands out from the
rest, and can be made to meet the
end of each of the ﬁngers. This
enables us to pick up and handle
small things with great delicacy.
None of the lower animals has a
thumb like man’s except a few of
the apes, and theirs is not so per-

more than any other part, except
the brain, that gives man his su-
periority over them. Its skill and ,

BONES OF THE LOWER LIMB.

SECTION IV.-1. The lower limb is divided into hip,
thigh, leg, and foot. In ordinary language, the word leg
means the lower limb from hip to foot. In anatomical
language, the part between the hip and knee is called the
thigh; the part between the knee and foot is the leg.

2. The hip-bone. is so irregular in shape, that the old
anatomists could not think of any name that suited it;
and so they called it the 03 imzominatum, nameless bone.

26 T [HE HUMAN BOD Y.

The two hip-bones come together in front. Behind
they are separated by the sacrum. The cavity inolosed
between them is the pelvis, or basin.

3. The femur, or thigh-bone, is the
longest bone in the body. 0
It has a round head, which
ﬁts into a socket in the hip-
bo11e. At its lower end it
spreads out to make a broad
surface for the knee-joint.
It is slightly curved.

4. In front of the knee is
a small bone, heart-shaped,

‘ 5. The leg has two bones,
the tibia (Latin, tibia, a flute) and the ﬁbula (Latin, ﬁbula,
a shawl-pin). The tibia is a strong bone. It has a sharp
ridge in front, which is called the shin. The tibia is
joined to the femur above. The ﬁbula is a long, slender
bone. It is joined to the tibia above and below. The
lower ends of these two bones are joined to the ankle-

row across the toes. Consequently the toes of most grown
people are squeezed together, frequently overlapping.
The great toe naturally rests a little separated from its
neighbor, and almost in a straight line with the inner
side of the foot. If We make it turn in, its principal joint
stands out prominent, and from the pressure becomes
inﬂamed. A bunion is formed there. A corn is another
painful result of pressure.

The foot is a much-enduring member, and is useful,
even though crippled. But grace and ease of movement
are constantly sacrificed, and numherless miseries in-
curred, for the sake of making the foot look small.

Athletes and pedestrians long ago discovered the neces-
sity of a shoe which gives freedom to the foot. Such a
shoe is never tight. The heel (if any) is low and broad,
and directly under the heel of the foot. The sole is as
broad as the foot itself, and at least half an inch longer.

STRUCTURE OF BONE.

SECTION V.——1. If we saw a long bone in two length-
wise two things are noticeable:——

1. Its shaft is hollow. During life the cavity is ﬁlled
with marrow. This consists largely of fat, and is a

store of nourishment which helps to sustain the body
when it is deprived of food. It has been proved by
experiment, that a hollow shaft is stronger than a
solid shaft of the same material and the same weight a11d
length.

2. The bony substance of the shaft is hard and com-
pact. The large ends, on the contrary, though they are
11ot hollow, are ﬁlled with cells, a11d present a honey-
combed appearance. It is desirable that the shaft should
be slender and strong. Its substance is, therefore, very
compact. It is desirable that the ends should be large,
to give a broad surface for the joints. Their substance is,
therefore, open. If it were compact, it would increase the
weight unnecessarily.

2. If we saw a ﬁat bone in two, as one of the bones of
the skull, or a short bone as one of the bones of the wrist,
we shall ﬁnd, that,
while its shell is of
compact tissue, its in-
side is of the same
honeycombed tissue
that we found in the
ends of the long bone.

3. Bones are well supplied with blood—vessels and
nerves. VV e can ﬁnd i11 every bone one or more holes
through which a small blood-vessel passes to the interior.
A living bone is covered with a membrane called the peri-
osteum. In this membrane is a ﬁne net—work of blood-
vessels, from which a countless number of little vessels
pass directly into canals iii the bone. These are called
Haversian canals. They run through every part of the
bone.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF BONE.

SECTION VI.———-1. Bone is about two-thirds mineral, and
one—third animal, matter. The mineral matter is chieﬂy
phosphateof lime. This substance makes more than half
of the bone. The mineral and animal matter are closely
combined, but they can be separated in two ways:—

1. If we put a bone in a moderate ﬁre, and burn it, it
will become porous and brittle, but will retain its shape.
The a11l111(‘¢'tlW__l11g_§L’Ll3€I’ is burned out, but the mineral remains.

rope, and can be tied in a knot. The acid has eaten out
all the mineral matter, but has left the animal matter.
If a bone has too much mineral matter, it is brittle.
This is the condition of the bones of old people, and some-
times of younger
persons. They
break Very easily.
In the bones of
children, on the
other hand, the
animal matter is
abundant; and
they will bend a

the disease of children called rickets, there is so little

mineral matter in the bones, that they are too soft. The

legs become bowed, the head enlarges, and the whole
frame gets out of shape.

ing the form which it is to keep through life. It is pliable,
and may be molded to healthfulness and grace, or to
deformity. Nature should be allowed to shape it in l1er
own Way, and all habits of dress or attitude or movement
that interfere with the natural outlines should be care-
fully avoided.

THE JOINTS.

SECTION Vll.—1. The joints of the body with which
We are most familiar are movable; but most of the joints
of the head-bones’ are like a
joint in a table or chair.
They are ﬁxed.

The joints between the
bodies of the vertebrae have
a little motion, but are not
freely movable like the joints
of the limbs.

There are, then, in the 
bO(ly, —-  

Immovclble joints. 

Slightly movable joints. "V xii“

Freely movable joints. i

2. The movable joints are
of various kinds. Sometimes JOINTS OF THE SKULL___L Emma]

little on each other, as in the bow‘

kind. ‘

Sometimes a round bone ﬁts into a round socket, and
moves in all directions. The hip—joint is of this kind.

PARTS WHICH COMPOSE A JOINT.

3. In a joint there are—

1. Two or more bones, each covered, where they come
in contact, with a thin,
smooth layer of cartilage
,,,/1,,‘  or gristle. Cartilage is
(!('/l'/,,,j//f’/ more elastic than bone,

/ and serves as a spring
in the joint.

2. Ligaments which
bind the ends of the
bones ﬁrmly together.
A ligament is a white,
glistening band, very
strong, and generally
not elastic. \Vl1en We
examine it with a mi-

Fig. 21. croscope, We ﬁnd that. it

THE H,P_,Om._ 1s made of ﬁne white

ﬁbers, lying side by side

like the threads of a ribbon, only there are no cross-
ﬁbers. They all ru11 lengthwise.

3. The cavity of the joint has a thin lining, called a
synomul membrane. This membrane gives out a ﬂuid
called synovia, or joint-Water. This serves the same pur-
pose that the oil we put in the joints of machinery serves.
But while these need constant attention, and soon wear
out, the living joint oils itself, and may be in constant
use for seventy years or more Without causing a thought
in the mind of its owner. ‘

If, however, joints become diseased, they are very

painful. They sometimes become enlarged and stiff and
misshapen.

4. The joints of young chil-
dren bend very freely: as they
grow older, they become less
ﬂexible. Some have “looser”
joints than others. Those pub-
lic performers who can twist
themselves into marvelous
shapes, are persons, who, by a
course of training begun early
in life, have gradually stretched
their ligaments.

5; Ligaments are tough, and
not easily hurt; but when we
do “sprain” a joint, which
means that we have torn or
overstretched its ligaments, they recover slowly.

GROWTH OF BONES.

SECTION VIII.—1. Bone, though it is so ﬁrm and
hard, is all the time wasting and being repaired, like the
soft parts. If madder, which is of a bright red color, is
mixed with the food of animals, their bones will soon
become dyed with it. This shows that the madder has
passed into the bones. After the madder is stopped, the
bones lose the red color. This shows that the madder
has passed out. It is reasonable to conclude that nour-
ishing matter passes in with the madder, and that waste
matter passes out as in other tissues.

It is therefore important for the growth of the bony
frame to keep the blood pure. '

34 THE HUMAN BODY.

2. The common belief that the growth of the frame of
an animal or of a child may be checked by alcohol or
tobacco is reasonable.

3. Drunkenness in parents is one of the causes of the
bone-diseases which deform scrofulous children.

CHAPTER III.

THE MUSCLES.

SECTION I.—1. The muscles are organs of motion.
They cover the bones, and constitute the “ﬂesh.” They
are found also in the walls of the alimentary canal, and
of the blood-vessels, and iii other inward parts. The heart
is chieﬂy muscle.

2. The muscles with which we are most familiar, act

I when we will that they shall act. VVe can walk, run, or

sit still; we can move our arms or our heads as we will;
but we can not stop the beating of our hearts in this way.
The movements of the intestines are also independent of
our will. i

3. Muscles are accordingly divided into two classes,-
voluntary, or those which are subject to the will; and
involuntary, or those which are not subject to the will.

4. The voluntary muscles constitute about two-ﬁfths of
the weight of the body. They are compactly arranged
over the skeleton, most of them being attached to a bone

SUGGESTIONS T0 TEACHERS.--1. A piece of fresh beef will illustrate to
the naked eye the gross structure of voluntary muscle. Witli a micra
scope magnifying four hundred times, a small fragment teased out with
a needle will show the structure of the fibers. The play of the muscles
and tendons in the fore-arm is easily seen in a thin person. The action of
involuntary muscle can be ‘seen in the iris, whose muscular ﬁbers contract
under the inﬂuence of light, but are not subject to the will.

2. Fibrous tissue is seen between the muscular bundles of beef. Ten-
dons show in the leg of a fowl.

-at each end. They are of various shapes, according to
their position and use. Some are long, some short: some
are round, and some ﬂat. In the living body, all the
muscles of a limb are bound together
and covered by ﬁbrous tissue.

5. Voluntary muscles are commonly
attached to a bone, at one or both ends,
by means of a tendon or aponeurosis.
A tendon is a glistening cord of ﬁbrous ‘
tissue. It is tough, and does not stretch.
An aponeurosis differs from a tendon
in being ﬂat. If the muscle is ﬂat, it
ends in an aponeurosis: if it is round,

6. There are more than ﬁve hun-
dred muscles in the body. Most of
them are in pairs, the two sides of the
body being alike. The smallest is the
stapedius, a muscle in the ear, which
is only one-sixth of an inch in length:
the longest is the sartorius, which ex-
tends from the hip to the leg below
the knee, and is over eighteen inches
in length. '

The biceps of the arm has two heads,
both arising from the shoulder-blade,
and is inserted into the radius just below the elbow.

The great muscles which pass from the breast-bone to p
the upper end of the arm are called’ pectorals. The
gastrocnemius constitutes a large part of thecalf of the

leg. Its tendon, called the tendon of Achilles, is inserted
into the heel, and is the largest tendon in the body.

PROPERTIES OF MUSCLE.

SECTION II.—1. Muscle has a peculiar power of short-
ening itself. There is a kind of elastic tissue in the body,
of which a few ligaments are made, which, like rubber,
will contract after it has been stretched; but muscle is
the only tissue that contracts without being stretched
first. When a muscle grows shorter, it grows thicker at
the same time, just as the body of a worm will shorten
and thicken. If, for example, I place my left hand on
the biceps of my right arm, and then bend my elbow, I
shall feel the biceps swelling, and growing hard: at the

Fig. 24.

the forearm is drawn up.

same time it has shortened, and thus drawn the bone
to which it is attached up toward the shoulder. , VVe do
not understand how it is that muscle contracts when We
will that it shall. We can only say that it does so.

2. Involuntary muscle has the same power of shorten-

THE M USCL 43

ring that voluntary muscle has. But it will not do this in

obedience to the Will. Cold contracts, and heat relaxes it.
The involuntary muscle in the walls of the intestine con-
tracts when food comes in contact with it. Many other
inﬂuences produce the same effect, but the will which
controls the Voluntary muscle has no authority over the
involuntary. Involuntary muscle never contracts as rap-
idly as voluntary muscle sometimes does. It moves in a
sluggish way.

STRUCTURE OF MUSCLE.

s SECTION III.—1. If we examine a little shred of vol-
untary muscle with a microscope which
i will magnify four hundred
times, we shall see that the
small ﬁbers which are Visi-
ble to the naked eye are
made up of still smaller
ﬁbers, and that these have
dark lines crossing them.
These microscopic ﬁbers are
gathered into bundles, and these again
into larger bundles. The muscle is
made up of many such bundles, sur-
rounded and bound together by ﬁbrous
membranes. \Ve ‘can readily see this
in a piece of beef. The ﬁbers con-

the ﬁbers of voluntary muscle; and they are broad in the
middle, and taper to each end. They have no cross-stripes,
and have a spot in the center called a nucleus.

MUSCULAR EXERCISE.

SECTION IV.—1. It is a law of Nature, that every liv-
ing thing, i11 order to remain in health, must do the thing
that it was made to do. A stone was made to lie inactive
and motionless. Men, as well as the lower animals, were
made for activity and motion. Every part of the body
must do the work that it was made to do. The muscles

a must move, the stomach must digest, the nerves must be

in use, the brain must think. The part which is allowed

to remain inactive becomes unhealthy and weak. This is

the great law of exercise.

2. This law applies especially to young persons. After
the body has got its growth, and has become ﬁrm and
strong, it can endure bad usage or neglect better than in
the growing period.

3. Some people are engaged in occupations which give

abundant exercise to all the organs of body and mind-

Such occupations tend to long life. Statistics kept in the
State of Massachusetts for thirty years, of the length of
life in different occupations, showed that the farmers lived
the longest.

4. Many employments require the use of the muscles
more than of the brain. Persons engaged in such em-
ployments should, during their hours of recreation, exer-
cise their minds. V

5. Other occupations engage the mind while the body
is inactive. Those who have such occupations should
seek recreation in muscular exercise.

THE’ M USCLES.’ 45

6. It is especially important that the muscles should be
exercised, for several reasons.

1. Because they are so large a part of the body. Nearly
one-half the weight of a man is muscle.

2. Because they are made capable of great activity.
They are abundantly supplied With blood-vessels, and the
current of blood should ﬂow freely through them. When
they are idle, its ﬂow is sluggish.

3. Because, when the muscles are exercised, all other
parts of the body are refreshed. We may exercise the
brain vigorously while the muscles are quite idle, and
the blood circulates no faster. But, when We exercise the
muscles, the heart beats more strongly, a11d the blood

. ﬂows more rapidly, not only through the muscles, but

also through the skin, the liver, the stomach, the brain.
The organs which remove waste matters from the blood
are more active, and the whole body is puriﬁed. Exercise
is Nature’s stimulant.

7. Muscular exercise is valuable, not only because it
promotes the general health, but also because it directly
improves the muscular system. A strong and well—shaped
body is to be desired. The ancient Greeks, who for their
physical beauty and vigor, and their intellectual power,
have been the admiration of all succeeding nations, made
very much of the cultivation of the muscles. Their
scholars and statesmen Were» proud if they could win
‘prizes in the great athletic games. Much of the work of
life is done by the muscles. It will be better done if they
are strong and well trained.

8. Three things are to be sought in the training of the
muscles, —— 1. Strength, 2. A.lertness, 3. Enduromce.

1. Strength. The muscles increase in size and power by

46 THE HUMAN anon}:

use. It is important that this increase should be uniform.
Exercises should be chosen with reference to the develop-
ment of arms, legs, and trunk. It is a common mistake,
to regard strength as the only end of muscular exercise.
A man is not required to do the Work of a horse. Great
strength does not always imply good health. Athletes
are sometimes overtrained, so that their health is impaired
while their muscles are large. Prize-ﬁghters frequently
die early.

2. Alertness. This is the power to obey quickly the
commands of the will or the impulse of the senses. In
many trades, and some professions, it is of the utmost
value. Games which require keen watching and rapid

T movements develop it.

3. En.dm°0m.ce. This is the power of continuing to make
efforts for a long time without tiring out. It is not always
the largest muscle that has the most of this quality. This,
with healthy action of other organs, constitutes what is
called “staying power,” and gives the victory in a long
race. It is acquired by regular exercise.

9. - Muscular exercises are valuable, also, because they
commonly train the eye and the ear to quickness of
perception.

10. The muscles are larger and ﬁrmer in men than in
women. Nevertheless, the need of muscular exercise is
just as real for one sex as for the other. It is as truly
requisite for their health and proper growth. Neither
unsuitable dress, nor false ideas of propriety, should be
allowed to deprive them of it.

11. Exercise, to be most useful, should be regular. To
take several hours of it to-day, and none to-morrow, is
less beneﬁcial than to take a moderate amount daily. It

TIIE -MUsoLEs. 47

should be taken, if possible, out of doors. Much of its
beneﬁt comes from breathing a great deal of pure air.
The more heartily the mind is interested and engaged,

‘ the more the beneﬁt.

12. Violent exercise should not be taken directly after a
full meal. ' At this time the stomach has Work to do. If
the blood is drawn away from it to the muscles, and all
the strength is engaged in muscular efforts, the digestion
will be checked. If such a practice be long continued,
the stomach will be weakened.

13. In muscular exercise, as in every thing else, it is
important to avoid excess. It is excess to exercise so long
or severely as to be unﬁt-ted for other occupations. It is
excess to exercise until a muscle or limb is painfully ex-
hausted, and does not soon rest. It is excess to attempt

through ambition exercises that are beyond the strength. ,

It is excess to engage in severe exercises when exhausted
by mental or other labor. '

Excessive exercise sometimes results in bleeding from
the lungs, sometimes in enlargement of the heart. That
organ, being compelled to overwork, becomes too large;
and this causes illness, and sometimes death.

14. There are many small muscles in the face, which

are attached by one end to the bone, by the other to the  

skin. By acting together, they give a great variety of
expression. The thoughts and feelings are indicated.
Grief causes one set of muscles to contract, joy another.
So naturally is the action of particular muscles associated
with certain emotions, that it is difﬁcult for mostpeople
to conceal their feelings from one W110 is steadfastly ob-
serving the countenance. The faces of the lower animals
are not as well supplied with muscles, nor are they as soft

PREFACE.

IN making this little book, I have tried to give to the
student a deﬁnite impression, in outline, of the structure
and functions of the human body. To this end I have
tried to omit all statements that would confuse the picture
by overloading it, and all statements that could not be
understood by those who will be its most numerous read-
ers. « I have not told them, “for example, that the re-action
of the saliva is alkaline, and that of the gastric juice acid,
because for many of them that statement would have no
meaning. I have not mentioned the names of many of
the muscles, because it is difficult and unnecessary to
remember them.

The laws of hygiene are given in connection with the
facts of anatomy and physiology from which they are
derived. Learned in this Way, they will remain i11 the
mind as guiding prvlnciples, and not simply as the dicta
of authority. p  

In treating of the effects of stimulants and narcotics, I
have endeavored to set forth facts which are susceptible
of abundant proof, and which are of the most importance,
practically, to those for whom this work is designed.

and movable as the human face. They express only a
limited number of thoughts and feelings. The face of
the lion expresses dignity; that of the tiger, cruelty; that
of the ox, patience. The expressions which are most fre-

_ quently on the face become after a time permanent: thus

the character is written on the countenance. A sullen or
bitter temper makes an unpleasing aspect. A genial and
kindly disposition will in time impart its own beauty to
the face.

EFFECT OF ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO.

SECTION V.—1. By the action of alcohol, muscle is
sometimes changed, in part, to fat. It thus becomes
ﬂabby and feeble.

Alcohol affects the muscles indirectly, by affecting
the digestion and the blood, and so spoiling their nour-
ishment.

The athlete training for a prize, knows Well, that, if he
indulges freely in alcoholic drinks, he Will surely fail to
bring his muscles to a hard and vigorous condition.
Total abstinence from alcohol and tobacco is important
for his success.

2. Firm and active muscles are desirable for every one.
The boy Who thinks it manly to smoke, is, by doing so,
lessening that muscular power which is an admirable and
manly possession. The pale faces, dull eyes, and ﬂabby
limbs which this practice tends to produce, give no sign
of manliness.   L

It is true that men distinguished for strength of body
are often users of intoxicating drinks or tobacco. But
it is also true that such men frequently become diseased,

CHAPTER IV.
WORK AND 'VVASTE.———TI-IE BLOOD.

SECTION I.—1. The body, like not-living machines,
tends to wear out by use. Even the enamel of the teeth,
which is the hardest substance found in it, at length gives
way.

2. The soft parts wear out very rapidly. In every
movement of a muscle, in every action of the brain, some

1 of their particles are worn away.

3. The body is always active. Even in sleep, the
breathing muscles, and the heart, and the muscles of the
digestive organs, are moving. The wear is, therefore,
constant.

4. But the body differs from a not-living machine in
being able to repair itself. In early life, it does more than
this. It builds itself up, and grows. VVhen it has got its
growth, it still repairs all waste, and may increase in
strength and endurance for many years. At length there
comes a period when it is not able to repair so much as it
once could; it can not, therefore, endure so much wear,-.-
the old can not be so active as the young; ﬁnally it is
unable even to supply the waste caused by the simplest
actions, such as breathing and digesting; then life must
cease.

SUGGESTION TO TEACHERS. ———The least stain of blood. on a glass slide,
under a microscope magnifying four hundred times, is sufficient to Show
the red globules. It is not always easy to ﬁnd white ones.

WORK AND WASTE. — THE BLOOD. 51

5. Few people die of old age. Generally, before the
time for such a death is reached, some disease attacks the
enfeebled body, and overcomes it. i

6. The process of repair is going on all the time: but,

during our waking-hours, waste is greater than repair;
hence, every one must sleep several hours in each twenty-
four. During sleep, the waste is very small; and the pro-
cess of repair restores to the system each night what it has
lost during the day.

7. The need of sleep is indicated by a feeling of fatigue
and drowsiness. These are the warnings that Nature
gives us to stop for repairs. \Vithout this feeling, we
would not be willing to lie inactive for so much of each

day. Since rest is very important, this feeling is made

so strong that it is almost impossible to resist it. Ex-
hausted men will fall asleep on horseback, or even
walking.

8. But Nature gives her warning in good time. If it is
necessary to continue working for a while after we begin
to feel tired, we can generally do so without injury; but
we must rest afterward. However tired we may be at
night, if we are rested by our night’s sleep we are safe;
but if the wear of the day is not fully repaired, and we
feel each morning more weary than on the morning be-
fore, we are in danger.

9. A very young infant sleeps most of the time. He
requires less sleep as he grows older. Grown persons
need from six to nine hours sleep every day. Indolent
people often take too much. On the other hand, it is
easy to injure the health, particularly in early life, by
taking hours which belong to sleep for work or pleasure
This is especially injurious when the weary body and

52 THE HUMAN 1201) Y.

mind are excited by stimulants, to make them forget the
need of rest.  

10. Sleep, though the most perfect, is not the only, way
of resting. When we have been using the muscles, we
may rest them while using the brain. After study, hearty
muscular exercise is rest. Entire change of occupation is

rest. ,
f MATERIALS FOR REPAIR.

SECTION II.—1. The materials by which the waste of
the system is repaired, are found in air, food, and water.
Air must be taken in constantly, food and water at fre-
quent intervals. We can live but a few minutes without
air: without water we should perish in a few days. Men
have lived without food for weeks, having air and Water;
but the body must at length be exhausted if these three
things are not regularly supplied in sufficient quantity,

2. We take oxygen from the air by the breathing
apparatus. We take food and water by the digestive
apparatus. Both are taken into the blood, and carried
through the body, to be used as needed in every part.

3. The blood not only carries the oxygen, food, and
water to every part of the body: it also carries away
from every part the waste matter which is formed there,
and delivers it to the organs which discharge it from the
body. It has been likened to an express-agent, who goes
about the streets of a city, leaving a parcel here, taking
one there, —— his wagon always loaded, though its contents
are consta11tly changing.

THE BLOOD.

SECTION III.——1. Blood is a red ﬂuid, not transparent,
having a salty taste. It is a little heavier and thicker

l'V0RI\7 ANI) W'ASTE.-—TlIE BLOOD. 53

than Water. If we look at a drop of it through a micro-
scope, we shall see in it many small round bodies, shaped
like a coin with a thick rim. These 4,

are only 3.3155. of an inch across, and

are all of the same size. They are Q@ ®®b @ <
called red-blood corpuscles, Or gl0I)- Q ®
ales. They make up nearly half the
blood.

2. Every animal that has a back-
bone has red globules in its blood, F113‘ 37-
but they differ in shape and size. “E§,‘;ff,‘j;jgL§fa,j’,‘;,:’,‘;j{*‘N
In birds a11d reptiles they are not
round, but oval, in shape, and have a spot in them called
a nucleus. In all animals that have round globules, they
are smaller in size than
those of a man’s blood,
with two exceptions, the
elephant and the sloth.

3. We know by careful
measurements the exact
size of these globules in
many animals. By ex-
amining a drop of blood

came from.

4. Such examinations are made of blood found on the
clothing of persons accused of murder, and aid in deter-
mining their guilt or innocence. But this evidence
should not be accepted as decisive. There are possibili-
ties of mistake.

5. Besides the red corpuscles, there are also white cor-

54 THE HUMAN BODY.

puscles, a little larger, and spherical in shape, in the pro-
portion of one white one to three or four hundred red.

6. The red globules have the property of attracting
oxygen to themselves. They take it from the air in the
lungs, and carry it to all parts of the body.

7. These globules give the blood its red color. If they
were all taken out, it Would be transparent and color-
less. VV hen there is a plenty of red blood in the blood-
vessels, there is a rosy hue in the cheeks, and the lips are
cherry red. This we call a healthy. color. It is healthy

, because it indicates that there is blood enough, and that

it is Well supplied with globules. As these are the car-

-riers of oxygen, a good number of them means plenty

of oxygen in the tissues; and that is necessary to good
health. On the other hand, colorless lips and skin. indi-
cate a lack of red globules, scanty oxygen, and ill health.

8. The watery part of the blood, in which the globules
ﬂoat, is called the plasma. This contains many sub-
stances dissolved in it, some of which are derived from
the food, and nourish the body; and some are Waste mat-
ters, which the blood is carrying away to be discharged.

9. VVhen blood flows out of the blood-vessels, it soon
thickens into a jelly. This is called the coagulation of
the blood.

10. Blood does not coagulate in the blood-vessels during,

life if they are sound. If the blood is ﬂowing very fast,
it will not coagulate until the flow is checked. If the air
is extremely cold, it does not coagulate quickly.

11. It is this coagulation of the blood that saves us
from bleeding to death when we are wounded. The clots
which form, stop up the mouths of the cut vessels. p L g

12. In case of a wound, the blood should be helped to

coagulate by pressing on the spot so as to check the flow.
Sometimes it is necessary to tie a handkerchief or a string
around the limb above, or sometimes below, the wound.
In this case the bandage should not be kept on too long,
as other parts of the limb may suffer from want of blood.

13. Loss of blood causes great Weakness, and at length

fainting. VVhen we faint, the heart almost stops its action,
and the ﬂow of blood becomes very slow. This gives it
an opportunity to coagulate, and stop up the bleeding
vessels. When the ﬂow of blood can not be stopped, a
fainting—ﬁt may save life.
. 14. The body of a man contains six or eight quarts of
blood. The loss of more than half of his blood would
be certainly fatal, and the loss of a very much smaller
portion might be so.

15. People near to death from loss of blood have some-
times been restored by throwing into their veins blood
drawn from another person. This is called transfusion.
It isia delicate and dangerous operation, and not often
useful.

16. Some causes of impure blood are,-

1. Bad air. a

2. Lack of exercise. This makes the flow sluggish. The
organs whose Work it is to purify it become inactive.
Waste matter accumulates.

3. Too much or too rich food. The blood becomes loaded
with matters which the system can not use and can not
easily get rid of.

4. Too little or too poor food. The blood becomes thin,
and unequal to the nourishment of the body.

5. Alcohol, which is itself an impurity, and unﬁts the
blood for its work.

56 THE HUMAN BODY.

17. Bad air is air that has lost its oxygen by being
breathed, or that has gases in it that do not belong to
fresh air. These gases commonly smell badly. They

come from decaying or other foul matters. Good air has’

no odor, and it is safe to follow our‘ noses when they
guide us out of any close place. But some of the Very
Worst air has no odor, and We must have other tests
than our noses.

18. The causes of impure blood, just mentioned, are
apt to go together, and help each other. The person Who
eats too much will not Want to exercise, While he needs the

.more to do so.

but little.

Moderate use of alcohol often excites the appetite for
rich food to excess. The inordinate drinker is apt to lose
his appetite, and take too little food. Often he can digest

EXPLANATION OF FIGURE.

THE ﬁgure on the opposite page shows the heart and the great blood-
vessels. The arteries are colored red, the veins are colored blue. ,

The right auricle and right ventricle of the heart are seen, and the
beginning of the pulmonary artery, coming from the right ventricle.
Arching from the heart, and passing down the back, is the aorta (red).
It divides, at its termination, into the two common iliac arteries. The
carotid arteries pass up on the sides of the neck. The subclavian arteries

pass off to the right and left, and are continued as the axillary arteries. ’

The venee cavee, ascending and descending, lie by the side of the aorta.
The internal jugular vein accompanies the carotid arteries. The external
jugular is just outside of the internal. The other veins have the same
names as the arteries which they accompany. The intercostal arteries
and veins run along the edges of the ribs on each side. The kidneys are
seen, one on each side of the aorta.

60   THE’ 11 UMAN BODY.

CHAPTER V.

THE‘. CIRCULATION.

‘SECTION I.—1. The blood is found in every part of the
body. But the body does not hold it as a sponge holds
Water. It is rather like a house which has a supplyof
water carried through it in pipes. The blood in the body
is all contained in pipes, called blood-vessels.

2. It is constantly in motion. Starting from the heart,

‘ it moves through the blood-vessels off to distant parts of

the body, and then back to the heart again, making a
circle. The heart and blood-vessels are, therefore, called
the organs of 'c2'rculatz'on. I

3. The blood-vessels are called arteries, capillaries, and
veins. Coming out of the heart is a very large artery,
called the aorta. This gives off branches as it passes on,
and these branches, again, other branches, growing smaller
as they divide, until at length the smallest branches are
called capillaries.

4. The capillaries are very numerous, very small, and
very close together. They form a net-Work in every inch
of bone and muscle and skin and brain,-—-a net-Work
ﬁner than the ﬁnest silk. We can not put a ﬁne needle-
point into the skin Without opening some of these capil-

laries, and drawing blood, so close together they are. If
we could take out from the body of a man all the ﬂesh

‘and bone, leaving the blood—vessels, there would still be

sufficient to form a perfect ﬁgure.
5. The arteries divide up into the capillaries, and the
capillaries unite to form the veins. The little veins thus

formed, unite to form larger veins, and so on, until at last .

they are all gathered into two large Vei11s which enter the
heart. These are called the vena cava superior, and the
vena cava. inferior. ~

6. The walls of the capillaries are very thin. Although
there are no openings in them, a portion of the blood
soaks through into the surrounding tissues; and, on the

. other hand, ﬂuids containing waste matter soak into them,

to be carried away.

THE HEART.

SECTION II.—1. The heart is made of muscle, and is
hollow. It is the pump which keeps the blood moving.

2. It is situated in the chest, resting on the diaphragm,
chieﬂy on the left side of the middle line. It is shaped
like a pear, with the small end pointing down, and to the
left.

3. It is inclosed in a sac called the pericardium. This
sac is also pear-shaped; but the large end is on the dia-
phragm‘, and the small end points up.

4. The pericardium is lined with a very’smooth mem-
brane. The heart is covered with a continuation of the
same membrane. This membrane is kept glossy and
moist by a ﬂuid that it gives out. \Vhen the heart moves
in its sac, these two smooth membranes rub together with-
out friction.

U2 TIIE HUMAN 1:01))’.

5. The apex, or point, of the heart is just beneath the
ﬁfth rib. Its base is a little to the right of the breast-
bone. It extends up as high as the third rib. It is held
in place by the diaphragm beneath it, and the large blood-
vessels which run into and out of it. It is about as large
as the ﬁst, weighing from eight to twelve ounces.

into four cavities. There is a division which runs across,

and one which runs lengthwise. This last divides it into
right and left sides, the other into auricles (Latin, awricula,
the external ear) and ventricles (Latin, 'uen.triculu,s, the
belly). These’ cavities are of nearly the same size, each
holding about three ounces. The walls of the auricles
are thin and loose. a The wall of the right ventricle is
about a sixth of an inch thick. That of the left ventricle
is half an inch thick.

7. The two large veins which bring the blood from the

THE CIRCULATION. 

body back to the heart, open into the right cmmlcle. Be-
tween the right auricle and the right ventricle, there is
an opening about an inch in diameter. This opening is
closed by the tricuspid (three—poin~ted) valve. This con-
sists of three thin ﬂaps, whose edges meet when the valve
is shut. This valve opens from the auricle, and shuts so as
to prevent the blood from passing back from the ventricle
to the sauricle. There are ﬁne cords attached to the edges

of these ﬂaps, and to the wall of the cavity below, to pre-

vent their shutting back too far.

8. Opening out of the right ventricle is the pulmonary
artery. This soon divides into two, one of which goes to
the right, the other to the left, lung. They there divide
into capillaries, and
the capillaries pass A  
into the pulmonary 
veins. These are 
two in number for
each lung. They
empty into the left
auricle.

9. At the begin- «
ning of the pulmo-
nary artery is a set of valves which prevent the blood
from ﬂowing back into the heart. These valves, called
semriltmar valves, are three pockets hung on the wall of
the artery, their edges meeting all around.‘ They open
away from the heart; and, when the blood is going in
that direction, they ﬂatten up against the wall, just as a
pair of doors will when a crowd is pushing through them.
VVhen the blood sets back toward the heart, it ﬁlls the
pockets; and theyrbulge out, and together ﬁll the tube,

and stop it up. These are very perfect valves. They are
ﬂexible, and ﬂoat open like thin veils when the blood
wishes to pass in the right direction; but they are strong;
and, the harder it presses back, the tighter they ﬁt.

10. The left auricle is similar to the right. The opening
between it and the left ventricle is an
inch in diameter, and is closed by the
mitral valve.

The mitral valve differs from the tri-
cuspid in having two ﬂaps instead of
three. When closed, it resembles a
miter, or bishop’s cap.

11. The left veintrvlcle differs from the

SEMILUNAR VALVES right only in having thicker walls.

PARRY CLOSED, 12. Out of the left ventricle opens

the great artery of the body, the aorta.

Its entrance is guarded by semilunar valves precisely like

those of the pulmonary artery described above. It gives

off numerous branches, which go to all parts of the body,

ﬁnally dividing into capillaries. From these capillaries
the blood is returned by the veins to the right auricle.

13. The muscle of which the heart is composed is pe-
culiar. It is striped, and yet not voluntary. As it must
act during sleep, it is made independent of will or thought.

The heart and the blood—vessels are lined by a mem-
brane as smooth as satin.

 

F1g. 31.

ACTION OF THE HEART.

SECTION III.—-1. The heart is, in the body, What the
mainspring is, in aiwatch. Like all other muscle, it has
the power of contracting. By constant and regular con-
tractions it keeps up the circulation, and thus sustains life.

'1‘IIE CIRCULA TION. 65

2. The heart-muscle is remarkable for its endurance.
No other muscle could do its work. Through a whole
lifetime, sometimes a hundred years, it never pauses for
one minute.

3. It might seem, therefore, to be a11 exception to the
general law, that rest is necessary for all organs; but, after
each contraction, it has a very short time of relaxation and
rest. This time is not more than two—ﬁfths of a second;
but, as it comes every second, its whole amount in twenty-
four hours would be eight or nine hours. Moreover, in
sleep the heart beats less rapidly, and is not obliged to
make the special efforts which are so often required of it

during the day by rapid movements or excitement.

4. The heart is, doubtless, tired after labor, and con-
tributes to the general sense of fatigue; but in health we
have no special feeling of the heart. Great and 1ong-con-
tinued care such as business men are often subjected to,
or protracted muscular exertion like that of soldiers on a
march, sometimes so exhausts the heart, that it acts irreg-
ularly, and feels distress. This condition, known to
physicians as “irritable heart,” may be brought on by
prolonged dissipation.

5. The number of heart-beats in a minute varies at dif-
ferent periods of life. In an infant it is one hundred and
twenty or more; in a child under fourteen, eighty or
more; in a grown person, about seventy-two. But it may
be ten beats more or less; and, in rare cases, there is a still
wider variation in health.

6. Many things cause a temporary variation. It is less
in sleep: it is greater in active exercise. One reason why
we soon become exhausted by running, is that the heart
is stimulated to such rapid action. It is greater after eat-

(56 THE HUMAN BOD Y.

ing in moderation. Excitement of any kind increases the
number and force of heart-beats so that they can be felt,
and sometimes heard. In the affection called palpitation,
the action of the heart is unnaturally rapid, and some-
times hard enough to shake the body.

7. The heart has been called a pump. It is really
a double pump. There are two streams ﬂowing out of
it with each contraction, and two streams ﬂowing into it
with each relaxation. The two sides
of the heart have no direct communi-
cation, and are often spoken of as the
right and left heart, as if they were
separate.

8. There are, accordingly, two dis-
tinct circles of blood. One begins at
the right ventricle, goes through the
pulmonary artery to the lungs, and
back through the pulmonary veins to
the left auricle. This is called the
pulmonary circulation, or the lesser
circulation. A

The other begins at the left ventricle,

‘\‘ -

GREATERAND LESSER tributed to all parts of the body, and,

CIRCULATION. . . .
passing through the capillaries and

veins, is poured into the right auricle by the vena cava
superior and the vena cava inferior. This is called the
systemic or greater circulation.

9. Let us observe .a contraction and its effect. Suppose
the auricles to be full. The blood has been pouring
into the right one from the venee cavae, and into the left
from the pulmonary veins. Now the auricles contract.

T THE CIRCULATION.   67

Their contents can not go back into the veins, for they
are full; but the ventricles have just emptied them-
selves, and are opening for a new supply. The blood is
therefore forced suddenly on through the passages, with
their open valves, into the ventricles. Directly the ven-
tricles, now full, begin to contract. The blood sets back
against the ‘valves it has passed, and shuts them tight,

just as a crowd trying to get through a door which  

opens towards them will often close it: but the passages
into the pulmonary artery and the aorta are clear,—
their valves (the semilunar) open out; into them the
blood pours, the ventricles still contracting until all is
squeezed out. Then the blood in the arteries sets back,

i and shuts the semilunar valves; and the ventricles re-

lax, and open for another supply.

SOUNDS OF THE HEART.

SECTION IV.—1. If the ear be placed upon the chest
over the heart, two sounds can be distinctly heard, re-
peated with each beat. One is quickly followed by the
other, and then there is an interval. The second is
shorter, and higher pitched than the ﬁrst. They may be

indicated by the signs i The ﬁrst sound is
lub - dub.

caused chieﬂy by the closing of the tricuspid and mitral
valves, as the ventricles contract. The second sound is
caused by the closing of the semilunar valves after the
blood has passed into the pulmonary artery and aorta.
When the heart is diseased, these sounds are changed;
and the changes in sound indicate to the ear of the
physician the particular changes in the heart.

THE ARTERIES, VEINS, AND CAPILLARIES.

SECTION V.—1. The aorta. arches from the base of
the heart across to the backbone, by the side of which

TH E CIR C ULA TI ON . 69

it descends. On a level with the top of the hip-bones, it
divides into two vessels, one of which supplies each of the
lower limbs. From the arch, branches are given off,
which supply the head and the arms.

2. In the thigh, the large vessel which carries the main T

stream is called the femoral artery. In the leg it is called
the tibial artery. ~ i

3. The carotid arteries carry the blood from the arch to
the head. They pass up on each side of the neck, and
their throbbing can often be seen. The subclavian ar-
teries lie behind the collar-bones. They extend to the
armpit, and in that situation receive the name axillary.
From the armpit to the elbow they are called brachial.

V At -the elbow they divide into the radial and ulnar. The
radial lies on the thumb-side of the fore-arm, and is the

one in which the pulse is commonly felt.

4. All the large arteries lie deep. They can be felt or
seen on the surface, only in a few places. But many large
veins lie just beneath the skin, and can be traced for some
distance. .

The deep veins run by the side of the arteries.

5. The veins frequently have the same names as the
arteries which they accompany. Sometimes they have
special names. The large veins of the neck are called
jugular veins. The superﬁcial jugular is the prominent
vein just beneath the skin on eachside.

6. The blood ﬂows in the large arteries much more
rapidly than in the small ones. Its ﬂow is slower in the
veins than in the arteries. It is slowest of all in the
capillaries. This is for the same reason for which a
stream ﬂows more slowly when its channel is wide than
when it is narrow. The capillaries are very small; but

7 0 THE HUMAN BODY.

there are so many of them, that their total blood-channel
is really wider. It is estimated that it is three hundred
times as Wide as the aorta.

7. Though many men of great minds gave much study
to the human body, it was not learned until less than
three hundred years ago that the blood circulated. VVil-

and gave it to the world.

8. The walls of the captllcmles
are a single layer of a thin mem-
brane. Through them nutritious
ﬂuids soak out, and waste ﬂuids
soak in.

9. Some points in which ar-
teries and veins differ :-

1. In the direction of thei'r cm"-
rent. In arteries it always runs from the heart: in veins
it always runs toward the heart.

be. In position. VVe do not ﬁnd
large arteries running just beneath
the skin, as veins do.

3. In color. The blue tint of their
blood shows through the walls of
the veins.

4. In thickness. The arterial Walls
are thicker and ﬁrmer.

5. The veins have valves at inter»
vals in their course, which allow the ,    »
blood to move forward, but not Fig, 35,

.._.

1. By its color. Venous blood is dark: arterial blood is
light.

2. By the manner of its flow. Venous blood ﬂows in a

steady stream, arterial blood in jets.

11. The flow of blood from a vein stops more readily
than that from an artery. A bandage is commonly suf-
ﬁcient, The arterial ﬂow is more forcible. When the
blood spurts, it must be checked by ﬁrm pressure on the
vessel until a physician arrives. It may be necessary to
tie the artery.  

The pulmonary artery is peculiar because it carries
blue venous blood. The pulmonary veins carry red ar-
terial blood. In these respects they are exceptions to the
general rule. .

12. Arteries and veins are very strong. In experiments
made, they have borne a pressure equal to a weight of a
hundred pounds Without bursting. But they sometimes
burst. In old age they become brittle. Certain diseases
make them brittle. ’

THE PULSE.

SECTION VI.—1. At a certain spot in the wrist, we can
feel a regular beat, which we call the pulse. A pulse may
be felt in several other places, but the wrist is the most
convenient. The pulse is a sudden rising-up of the wall
of the artery under the ﬁnger, and a slight stirring of the
whole artery in its bed.

2. Every time theheart contracts, about six ounces of
blood are thrown into the arteries. These, being elastic,
stretch to receive it.   Between the beats they contract,
forcing the blood along into the capillaries. c 

This stretching is greatest in the aorta, close by the

72 THE I1 UMAN 1201) Y.

heart, and diminishes as the Vessels grow smaller. By
the time the capillaries are reached, there is no stretching,
hence no pulse. The Veins have no pulse.

3. The pulse tells us,——

1. How fast the heart is beating.

2. How St’/'0'n..g its beat is.
. 3. How firm the coats of the arteries are. The last fact
is important. The arterial walls are sometimes ﬂabby,
and sometimes hard and resisting. Their condition indi-
cates the state of the system.

VARIATIONS IN BLOOD-SUPPLY.

SECTION VII.—1. You might suppose, from what has
been said of the circulatory apparatus, that the same
blood-vessels are always of the same size, and that the
blood-supply to the same part is at all times of the same
amount. This is not the case. Although there are no
stopcocks in the blood-Vessels, there is a contrivance of
Nature by which the size of the blood-Vessels and the
amount of blood in any part is increased or diminished
according to the need of the moment.

2. In this way the blood is partly shut oﬁ” from the
brain when we need sleep; it is turned on to the stomach
during digestion, and to the muscles in active exercise; it
is shutoff from the skin when it is cold, and sent there
to be cooled when We are Warm.

3. The Walls of the arteries consist partly of ﬁbers of
involuntary muscle running crosswise. When these mus-
cle—ﬁbers contract, they make the artery smaller: when
they are relaxed, it is larger. They are not under the
control of the Will, but are influenced by special causes.
For example, the arteries in the coats of the stomach will

THE C1.RCULATION. 73

grow larger when food touches it. The arteries of the

salivary glands will grow larger, and ﬁll witl1 blood for

the manufacture of saliva, when we smell food, thus “mak-
ing the mouth water.” The arteries of the skin will grow
larger, and ﬁll with red blood, when exposed to heat. The
arteries of the face will expand, and cause a blush, when
we feel shame.

4. The apparatus which regulates the size of the arte-
ries belongs to the nervous system.

EFFECT OF, ALCOHOL ON THE CIRCULATION.

SECTION VIII.—1. The heart of a grown person beats
about seventy-two times in a minute. The total number

of strokes in a day is over a hundred thousand. In mak-

ing this number of strokes, it exerts force enough to lift
over a hundred tons weight one foot from the ground.
Alcohol makes the heart of a well person beat faster.
Very careful experiments made by Drs. Parkes and Wol-
lowicz show that the drinking of a moderate amount of
alcohol —not more than two ounces in a day—will add
to the force exerted by the heart four per cent, enough to
lift four tons weight one foot. T

This extra effort of the heart is unnecessary; it is of no
use to the body; and, since it is made under an unnat-
ural stimulus, it is exhausting.

2. The smaller blood-Vessels are dilated by the inﬂu-
ence of alcohol. The face is flushed; and the internal
organs, if we could see them, would look redder. At ﬁrst,
the ﬂushing passes off after a certain time, and the blood-
vessels return to their natural size. But, after long use of
spirits, they remain dilated. The red nose is an index
of the state of many parts of the body. This is an unnat-
ural and unhealthy condition.

74 THE HUMAN BODY.

3. Alcohol has the power to change muscle gradually

‘into fat. The heart is particularly liable to this change.

As the ﬁbers soften down, it loses its strength. It can
not do the Work of pumping the blood through the body
with its; natural vigor. The ‘body, therefore, suffers in
every part. Such a fatty, soft heart is liable to break
suddenly.

  4. As old age comes on, the Walls of the arteries fre-
quently become changed in previously healthy persons.

They get fatty and soft, or chalky and brittle, in spots.‘

In this state they easily burst, if by excitement, or over-
eating, or some other cause, they are unusually full. This
is especially liable to occur in the blood-vessels of the

‘ head. The blood pours out; and, as the skull is a tight

box, the brain is pressed so hard that it can not act.
The person so affected becomes unconscious, and is very
likely to die. This takes place suddenly, and it is called

-apoplexy.

T5. Apoplexy is a disease of advanced life. These
changes do not take place in the arteries of the young
Without special causes. Alcohol is such a cause. It
makes the young man old before his time, and liable to

sudden death by the rupture of an artery in the brain.

we eat or drink to satisfy hunger and nourish the body.

2. If we have to repair any manufactured article, we

of. s We repair a harness with leather, a stove with iron,

a table with wood. So our food, which repairs the body,
must contain the same substances that the body contains.

but little in our food. S'u,lphu,r is one of these. Others
are abundant in the body, and are found in almost every

articleiof food. Carbon is one of these. If any of these '

elements is entirely wanting in our food, we suffer, and
would starve to death for lack of some of them. If we
should try to live on food which contained no phlosphomw,
for example, we should become diseased, and die. Almost
every thing that we eat contains phosphorus.

5. Other elements than the ﬁfteen given above, are not
required in our food. Silver, for example, does not form
part of the body, or of our food, but nitrate of silver is
sometimes used as a medicine.

6. All of these ﬁfteen elements are found in the arr, the
ea.i*th, and the water. But animals can not feed on earth
and air and water. Plants can, and that is one of the
great distinctions between plants and animals Four-
ﬁfths of the air is nitrogen. But men, and other animals,
would die for want of nitrogen, even while they were
drawing it into their lungs with every breath, if they
could not get food containing it.

7. It is the work of plants to take the elements, and make
them into food for animals. The plant feeds on earth,
air, and water. This earth, air, and water become a part
of itself. The animal feeds on the plant, or on other
animals.  

8. Probably every plant is food for some animal. But
there are very many which are not food for man. Some
are poisonous. A large number contain the necessary
elements, but can not be digested by the human organs of
digestion. A fertile prairie which would fatten a herd of
buffaloes would starve a man; because the grasses, though
not poisonous or distasteful, contain too much indigest-
ible matter for his stomach.

FOOD AND WATER, STIMULANTS, ETC. 79

9. Some animals live only on other animals. Their
teeth are not ﬁt for chewing vegetable food. Other
animals live wholly on plants. Their teeth are made for

' grinding, but not for tearing ﬂesh. The cow, for example,

has no cutti.ng—teeth in her upper jaw. She has broad
grinders. Man eats both animal and vegetable food.
His teeth are adapted to both. a

10. The infant, and the young of many of the lower
animals, live on milk. No other article of food so well
combines all the necessary elements as this. It is easily
digested, and, after infancy is passed, is still an excellent
article of diet. In sickness it is often used with advantage
as the sole nutriment.

11. Man’s ordinary diet consists of meats (including ﬁsh
and eggs), starchy foods, sugar, and fat.

MEATS.

12. Of meats, there are many kinds. The appetite is
gratiﬁed, and the body better nourished, by a variety.
Beef is the best. Pork is the staple meat-food of large
numbers of people. It is not so Wholesome as beef, for
two reasons r --

1. It commonly contains a great deal of fat,—too much
for constant use.

2. It is more likely than beef or mutton to contain the
young of the tapeworm, and other parasites.

Veal is tender and good, but not so easily digested as
beef, nor is it so nourishing. Lamb is very easily digested.
Mutton is more nourishing than either lamb or veal, and
is nearly as good food as beef. To some stomachs, how-
ever, it is not acceptable. Each of the various kinds of
game has its peculiar ﬂavor, but they do not differ much
in nutritive value.

80 THE HUMAN BODY.

All meat is better and more tender for being kept for a
time after killing.

13. Fish, on the other hand, is better when perfectly
fresh. It does not differ very muc.h from ﬂesh in its
che1nica.l composition; though it contains more water, and
less fat. It is lighter and less stimulating than ﬂesh.

14. Of s/tell-ﬁsh, oysters occupy the ﬁrst place. They
are palatable, light, and nourishing. They tempt the
appetite of an invalid Without distressing his stomach.
In spring and early sunnner, they should not be eaten.

15. Lobsters, crabs, and shrimps are less digestible.

1 Vinegar and stimulating spices are commonly added to

them, which spur up the stomach to its task. They should

be avoided by invalids.

16. Eggs contain much nourishment, solidly packed
away for the support of the young fowl before he breaks
out of his shell. They are palatable, and easily digested.

STARCHY FOODS.

17. The starchy foods include all the grains—- wheat,
oats, corn, etc.— and vegetables.

Dried wheat contains, in 100 parts, 66 parts of starch.

Dried oats contain, in 100 parts, 60 parts of starch.

Dried rice conta.ins, in 100 parts, 88 parts of starch.

When we remember that many millions of the human
family live chieﬂy on rice, Whose solid substance is almost
all starch, we have good proof of the importance of starchy
food.

18. Besides starch, the grains contain mineral matters,
fat, sugar, and a substance, similar i11 chemical composition
to meat, called gluten-.

- Wheat is, on the whole, the most valuable of the grains

‘FOOD AND WATER, S'l‘IMULANTS, ETC’. 81

as food; and men prefer it when they can get it. But each
grain has its own advantages. Corn is rich in oil. Oats
have much mineral matter, and much ﬁbrous, branny
substance, which make them indigestible for some delicate
stomachs. For the majority they are healthful. It has
been claimed that ground wheat is better food with the
bran in it,——in which condition it is called gI‘aha1n flour,
—- than when the bran has been separated from it, and it
has been made into ﬁne ﬂour. In sifting out the bran, we
take away a good deal of nutritive substance; and what is
left is chieﬂy the starch. The advocates of this View were
numerous a few years ago, and were called Grahamites, after
their leader Graham. Nevertheless, ﬁne white ﬂour is still
the choice of the majority. It is true that much nourish-
ment is lost in the bran. But it is so mingled with woody
matters, that it is not easily extracted by the stomach.

For healthy people, it is better to use white ﬂour, and’

to get, in other and more digestible foods, what is con-
tained in the bran. But a stomach that is sluggish in its
action, is stimulated and aided by the presence of the bran.
For such, graham ﬂour is excellent food.

19. The potato is the most popular of all vegetables,
though it has not been in common use more than three
hundred years. It has been estimated that it forms at
least three~ﬁfths of the food consumed in Ireland. Its
chief solid ingredient is starch. Much of the starch used
in the laundry is extracted from potatoes. It is superior
to other Vegetables in being drier, and containing less
ﬁbrous substance. V

20. Pease and beans contain Very little Water, and a
great deal of solid matter. They are Very nutritious, and
are most valuable for feeding armies, and other large

82 T1111? 11 UMAN B01) Y.

bodies of men, because they contain so much in small
bulk. But, because they are so solid, it is hard for the
stomach to digest them.  

21. Tzmzips, beets, cabbages, and other garden vegetables,
contain more Water and less nutritive matter than those
already referred to. They form a11 agreeable and health-
ful additionto more nutritious articles.

SUGAR.

22. There are many kinds of sugar, all sweet, but
differing in taste and solubility. Most of our vegetable

  food contains sugar, and a great deal of pure sugar is used

in addition to this. It is especially pleasing to the taste.
The fact that children are so fond of it, is a proof that it
has important uses in the growing period. But, if too
much is eaten, it spoils
the appetite and diges-
tion, and injures the
health.

°”""”‘°B‘”‘Es' T Butter is the oil of milk.

If we look at a drop of milk with a microscope, we see in-
numerable little particles of oil. Oil is lighter than water;

F001) AND WA TEH, s1'IMULAN7's, ETC. 83

and, therefore, if milk is allowed to stand, the oil will rise
to the surface, making the cream. After the cream is
taken off, the milk looks thinner and more transparent.
If all the cream could be removed from it, it would be
clear, like water. In making butter, the milk is churned
until all the oily particles are stuck together in a mass,
and the watery part is separated: this latter is called
buttermilk.

COOKING.

24. Animals eat their food raw. Men, even the most un-
civilized, cook much of it. Coolcing is useful in three ways.

1. It renders food more digestible.

2. It kills parasites in meats, and stops putrefaction.

3. It creates flavors which are attractive, and stimulating
to the digestion.

25. Raw meat is not unpalatable; a fondness for it is
often acquired. A disease called ti‘ichinosis is caused by
eating -pork, which contains a minute worm called a trich-
ina. This worm can not be recognized in pork without
a microscope. It is killed by cooking: smoking is not
sufﬁcient. The disease is, therefore,.found only among
those who have eaten raw pork. Tape-worms are also
acquired by eating raw pork andheef.

26. \V e can not digest starchy foods,such as the grains
and vegetables, in suﬂicient quantity, unless we cook them.
By cooking, we soften them so that they can be easily
separated into fragments, and dissolved by the digestive
juices. Besides, we add to them, in cooking, various
articles, such as salt, fat, sugar, and spices, which improve
their taste. Flour is, in this way, made into bread, and
cake, and pastry of many kinds.

84 TIIE II UMA N 1:01) Y.

27. The essential points for making good bread are,-—

. Good ﬂour. .

. Thorough kneading, to mix all the ingredients.

. Good yeast.

. Good judgme72.t exercised in keeping the rising mass
just warm enough, and letting it rise just long enough.

5. Having tl1e oven just hot enough, and taking out the
bread at just the right time.

28. Good bread is light and sweet. Bread is light when
the carbonic-acid gas formed in the fermentation caused
by the yeast has penetrated the whole loaf, making in-
numerable holes and pores in it. VVhen such bread is
eaten, the digestive juices easily enter these pores, and

~t~\¢.»sN~

‘ spread through and act upon every part.

Bread is heavy when carbonic-acid gas has not pene-
trated the mass, either because the yeast is poor, or the
flour is poor, or because it has not been thoroughly
kneaded. It makes a solid lump in the stomach, which
the digestive juices can not easily enter; and that organ
becomes weary and sore in struggling with it.

Bread may be sour, either because there is too much
yeast in it, or because fermentation has gone on too long.
In that case, acetic acid is formed in it.

29. Pastry and cake are not so wholesome as bread.
They please the taste, and in small amounts are not
injurious. Pie-crust is not commonly so light as bread.
Besides, it has a good deal of lard or butter thoroughly
mixed with it. This fatty matter, which is not acted upon
by the juices of the stomach, coats over the particles of the
ﬂour, and prevents the gastric juices from reaching them;
so they must pass out into the small intestine undigested.
This is the reason why all food fried in fat is less easily

FOOD AND WATER, STIMULANTS, ETC. 85

digested than food cooked in other Ways. In the process
of frying, the fat is so thoroughly mixed With the food, that
it renders it partly proof against the stomach-juices.

Cake contains too much sugar and butter, in proportion
to its other nutritive matters, to be Wholesome in large
quantities.

30. Cookery is an art which is very important to health
and comfort. It must be learned by practice. But those
who understand the principles of chemistry and physi-

ology, on which it rests, will acquire it more readily, and

be more completely masters of it.

MINERAL SUBSTANCES.

31. Mineral substances are mingled with all our food.
Salt is the only solid mineral matter that we take pure.

It enters into every part of the body, solid or ﬂuid, and

aids the processes of life.
Mineral matters are not commonly changed by digestion.

WATER.

32. Water forms about seventy of every hundred parts
in the body. It must be constantly supplied, therefore, to
make up for the Waste of the parts. Digestion, absorp-
tion, and circulation would stop Without Water. The
craving for it is stronger than for food.

33. Waters used for drinking always contain a small
portion of mineral salts, of gases, and of vegetable mat-
ter. Water which is absolutely pure—as only distilled
water is—is ﬂat and tasteless. The mineral matters in
drinking-waters are such as are not harmful to the sys-
tem, unless there is too much of them. In that case, they
are irritating to the bowels and kidneys. -When water is

86 THE HUMAN BOD Y.

carried through lead pipes, it sometimes dissolves enough
of the lead to become poisonous. Whether it Will do this,
or not, depends on What it already contains. Some
waters may be carried through lead pipes With perfect
safety, either because the Water does not act on the lead
at all, or because it contains certain mineral matters
which form a crust, lining the pipes, and protecting
them from further action. When lead pipes are used,
the question whether the Water acts upon them, should
be settled by a chemist if necessary. Tin pipes are safer.
Water that is constantly running through lead pipes is
less likely to contain much lead than that Which stands
still in the pipes for long periods Without change. Lead,

i when taken in small doses in this Way, produces its

effects very gradually; and the health is often seriously
affected before the cause is discovered. Among the symp-
toms of lead-poisoning are colic, and paralysis of certain
muscles.

134. Oﬁensioe and poisonous matters, animal and vege-
table, sometimes ﬁnd their Way into drinking-water, and,
being dissolved in it, give no sign of their presence.
Sewage, and the germs of disease, may thus be taken in.
It is necessary, therefore, to guard the Well, or water-pipes,
very carefully from all_ impurities. \Vells and reservoirs
are often placed where they catch the drainage from barn-
yards, or other receptacles for ﬁlth. Such drainage will
go through the soil much farther than is commonly sup-

- posed. The fact that Water is clear and sparkling and

odorless does not prove it pure. A well or reservoir
should not be located Within thirty feet of any ﬁlthy spot.
Even at that distance it is not safe if the ground is porous,
and slopes toward thewell. l

FOOD AND WATER, ‘STIMULANTS, ETC’. ‘S7
Aqueduct-pipes sometimes become leaky, and draw i11
ﬁlth. Constant watchfulness against the foes to ‘health,
which would enter in this Way, is necessary. N

EATING AND DRINKING HABITS.

35. The eating and’ drinking habits of mankind vary
greatly. They are modiﬁed by climate and by surround-
ings. T The Esquimaux drink ﬁsh-oil and eat candles
with a relish; the Hindoo lives upon rice; the Arab sup-
ports life, and performs great journeys, on a handful of
grain a day. The European or American requires more
and better food. The human body can adapt itself Won-
derfully to its circumstances. But those nations, Which,

by reason of their geographical situation and their Wealth,

have been able to obtain the best’ and most varied diet,
have the best and strongest bodies.

n 36. There is also a great variety in the habits and tastes
of members of the same race or community. Some pre-
fer one kind of food, and some another. Some eat two
meals, and some three. Constitutions, habits, and circum-
stances make great differences. One man may thrive on
food that would destroy another. A brain-worker may
accomplish most and feel best if he eats little until noon:
a day-laborer Would lose his vigor under such a practice.
One man is over-stimulated by a meat-diet: another ought
to live chieﬂy on meat.  

If Nature had not made mankind capable of such vari-
ations in habit, the Work of the World could not be done.

37. A healthy appetite is Nature’s guide to right habits
of eating and drinking, but Nature intended that appe-
tite should be controlled and regulated by reason. Each
man will thus adopt that course which is best for him.

88   THE HUMAN BODY.

38. When large bodies of men have to be fed, as in the
army or navy, it becomes necessary to ﬁnd out just how
much of each kind of food a man requires daily. By
combining physiological reasonings with experiment, Pro-
fessor Dalton found, that for a man in health, taking free
exercise in the open air, the following was a sufficient
daily ration: -

Meat . . . . . . . . 16 ounces.
Bread . . . . . . . 19 “
Butter . . . . . . . . 3.} “

Water . . . . . . . 52 “
Total, Water, 3}; lbs. ; solids, 2 lbs. 6% ounces.

‘ Men at hard labor require more, and those who are en-

tirely inactive, less.

STIMULANTS AND NARCOTICS.

SECTION II. — 1. Stimulants are substances which excite.
Narcotics are substances which benumb and stupefy. Some
substances are both stimulants and narcotics. Alcohol, if
taken in small quantity, is a stimulant: in large quantity
it is a narcotic.

2. Nature supplies us with certain food-stimulants which
are useful. Stimulant is from a Latin Word, stimulus, mean-
ing a goad. These substances afford little or no nourish-
ment, but they goad the appetite and the digestive organs
to greater activity. Such are pepper, spice, and mustard.
Though good in moderation, they may be used i11 such
quantities as to injure the stomach, and make the body
liable to various disorders.

FOOD AND WATER, STIMULANTS, ETC. 89

TEA AND COFFEE. "

3. Tea and coﬁee are used by all civilized nations. Their
immediate effect is cheering. They often aid digestioii.
They satisfy the cravings of the stomach, and enable men
to endure hardship better. But many persons are injured
by them,—some, because they drink too much; others, be-
cause they are too susceptible to their action. The morning
cup of coffee is often paid for by a daily headache. There
are intemperate tea-drinkers. Tea contains a good deal
of tannin, which has a tendency to check the action of
the stomach and bowels. Tea made as the Chinese make
it, by simply pouring boiling water on the leaves, and

not steeping long, contains more of the delicate ﬂavors,

and less of the tannin, than that Which is boiled for some
time. The fact that some healthy people can not go to
sleep at the usual time if they take a cup of tea in the
evening, shows that it has a decided effect on the nerves.
Fretfulness and irritability, and palpitation of the heart,
are results of its immoderate use.  

4. Ooﬂee, as ordinarily made, contains more solid mat-
ter than tea, and is, therefore, more nourishing. It has
less of the astringent principle, and is more soothing.

  Both tea and coffee will sometimes relieve headache.

It is necessary that the stomach should be very warm
in order to digest well. If food is taken cold, or if the
Whole body is in a chilly state, the cup of tea or coffee
awakens the stomach to activity by conveying heat in an
agreeable form. .

5. Growing children should drink neither tea nor cof-
fee. Their fresh and vigorous bodies need no other
stimulants than air, exercise, and simple food-.. They ‘are,

90 i TIIE II UMAN BODY.

besides, much more susceptible than grown persons to the
bad effects of these things.

TOBACCO.

6». Tobacco is a drug of very great power. A drop of
the oil extracted from it, placed on the tongue of a dog,
W.ill kill him almost as quickly as prussic acid. It is

occasionally used as a medicine, but with caution, because a

its effects are so severe.

Its odor and taste are disagreeable. When taken for
the ﬁrst time, it causes intense nausea and wretchedness.
By persisting in its use, the revolt of nature is commonly

_ o.vercome, anda liking for it is acquired. Its immediate

effect is then a feeling of tranquillity and comfort. Sol-
diers and sailors, and others Who have to endure great
physical labors, ﬁnd in it support and relief. Students
use it because it gives them a freer ﬂow of ideas; men of
pleasure, because it causes agreeable sensations. In some
cases it seems to do no harm: in others, its bad effects are
easily seen.    

7. It diminishes the appetite for food. It sometimes
causes disease of the mouth and throat. It weakens the
stomach. It becomes an absolute necessity: brain and
stomach demand it. Often the amount used must be
increased until it is hardly ever out of the mouth. At
ﬁrst soothing the nerves, it at last makes them irritable
and unsteady. .

.8. Its. effect on the heart is so marked, that the term
“smolcers’ heart” is Well known to physicians as indicating
irregular and weak action. The student whose brain. is
rendered more active. by it, may ﬁnd himself suffering at
length. from head-troubles, and failure of nerve-strength ;

FOOD AND WATER, STIMULANTS, ETC. 91

and he ends his Work before his time. The business-man
who has gone beyond his natural powers, with the aid of
tobacco, ﬁnally breaks down entirely.

9. It is evident that the effects of tobacco on the young
are especially evil. Boys who use it are dwarﬁng their
minds and bodies. They are so changing the system
from its natural healthy condition, that it is preparing
for disease, and acquiring tendencies that lead to dissi-
pation and worthlessness. They have no possible excuse
for its use.

10. Whatever satisfaction it may give, is purchased at
tl1e expense of slavery to it, often of personal neatness, and
at the constant risk of offending companions unused to it.

1 In some occupations it is a serious hinderance to success.

OPIUM.

  11. “Opium,” said the great physician Boerhaave, “is the
ﬁnger of God.” Whoever has seen or felt the cessation of
pain that seemed unendurable, under its power, can re-
spond to his sentiment. Rightly used, it is a boon: per-
verted to purposes of sensual gratiﬁcation, it is the cause
of untold misery. e W
12. Opium not only relieves pain, but, in small doses,
gently stimulates the brain and nerves, making the taker
able to endure and accomplish more than he otherwise
could. In larger doses, it induces a dreamy state, in
which he is released from the annoyances of life, and
wanders freely on the wings of imagination." In poison-
ous doses, a stupor comes on, in which the breathing
becomes slow, sometimes not more than two or three
breaths being taken in a minute. The pulse is also slow
and full. When this point is reached, the slumber is likely

92   THE HUMAN 1201) Y.

to become deeper until death ensues. To avoid this, it is
necessary to do every thing to keep the drowsy person
awake,-——to beat and pinch him, to keep him on his feet,
and walking, to throw cold water on him.

13. Those who acquire the opium habit become en-  

slaved to it. Its chains are even stronger than those of
alcohol. The misery which the attempt to go without
occasions, overcomes the strongest will. The victim be-
lieves that he will die, that he is dying, and that only
opium will save him; and, in these circumstances, those
apparently most conscientious will lie and deceive to obtain
it. The practice tends to kill truthfulness in the soul,

g and to undermine the whole character.

14. Opium has a paralyzing eﬁect on the digestive appara-
tus. It checks the flow of digestive juices, and the action
of the muscular walls of the bowels. It takes away the
appetite for food. In those not habituated to it, it com-
monly causes nausea. When not under its inﬂuence, the
opium-taker suffers from headache and depression. His
nerves are relaxed, his mind dull, and his will feeble. He
is unﬁttedfor the work of life, and his only object is to
gratify his craving.

15. Opium should never be taken, except under the direc-
tion of a phys/icz'a'n. Those who are suffering from pains
which are likely to return and visit them frequently,
should avoid it. It is better to endure pain than to
become a victim of the opium habit.

ALCOHOL.

16. Alcohol can be made out of any thing that contains
sugar. It is only necessary to add yeast, or to allow it to
stand uncovered in a warm place. In raising bread, the

FOOD AND WATER, STIMULANTS, ETC’. 93

sugar which is contained in the flour is changed into
alcohol and carbonic-acid gas. This is fermentation.
But the heat of the oven causes the small portion of
alcohol to evaporate. The carbonic-acid gas, after pufﬁng
up the loaf, and making it light, also disappears.

17. Wines are the fermented juice of grapes. They
contain from ﬁve to twenty-five per cent of alcohol.

Brandy, rum, whisky, and gin are distilled liquors, and

are about half alcohol. Beer, ale, and porter are made
from grain, and have from three to eight per cent of
alcohol. Cider is made of apple-juice, and has from
three to ten per cent of alcohol. The home-made Wines,
from currants, gooseberries, and elderberries, contain a

T small percentage of alcohol.

18. Wines and liquors are very commonly adulterated.

The pure article is costly. Some of the substances used ,

are cocculus indicus, alum, aloes, copperas, sulphuric acid,
nux vomica or strychnine, jalap, and lime. By adding
certain substances to an inferior Wine, or even to alcohol
and Water, the taste and effect of good Wine can be imi-
tated, and a large proﬁt made. Beer and porter are also
sometimes adulterated, to modify their ﬂavor, and cheapen
their manufacture.

19. Alcoholic drinks cause a ﬂushing of the skin and
a feeling of warmth. But they do not maintain the heat
of the body: they rather lessen it. This has been proved
by careful experiments, and by the experience of travelers
in the arctic regions.

They check the waste and repair that are naturally going
on. This may be at times an advantage, ——-in a Wasting
disease, for example. But in health it is much better
that the natural processes should be undisturbed.

O4   THE HUMAN BODY.

20. Athletes who are training for hard trials of their
bodily vigor, abstain from alcohol and tobacco. Disease,
early failure of strength, and premature. death, are the
results of drinking-habits. Physicians, insurance com-
panies, and all observing men, testify to this.

21. It is not always true that the strong liquors are
most pernicious, nor that the milder drinks are compara-
tively harmless. In some sections of this country, cider
is a worse evil than whisky. Its apparent harmlessness
attracts those who would refuse stronger liquors. When
the appetite for this drink is awakened, it requires for its

a satisfaction an amount of soaking that keeps the faculties

benumbed, and reduces the individual to Worthlessness

as surely as more ﬁery, but less abundant, potations.
22. It is a melancholy fact, that “the evil that men do,”

in this regard, “lives after them.” The iniquities of the
fathers are visited upon the children. By an inﬂexible
law of nature, the effects of alcohol are not expended upon
the user alone. Morbid cravings for drink, tendencies
to disease, weakness of body and mind and character,
are the heritage of misery which he bestows upon his
offspring.   s

23. Chloral is a drug of great value in the hands of the
physician. It gives sleep to those who can not sleep in
the natural way. But it is dangerous, It has caused
death. A habit of using it may be acquired which is
very injurious to body and mind, and very difﬁcult to
break.
