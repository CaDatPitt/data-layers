GEOGRAPHY OF AMERICA.
all lay together in one continent, mankind acquired a general, though
still imperfect, notion of their shape and extent. But America was
separated from Asia by the Pacific Ocean, almost ten thousand miles
across; and from Europe and Africa, by the Atlantic, about three
thousand miles across.  Of America, therefore, the people knew
nothing.
6. The ships in old times were small-, ill-built, and feeble, compared with the ships of the present day. The people did not know
the shape of the world; the art of navigation was in its infancy, and
even the mariner's compass, that mysterious but steadfast friend of
the mariner, was not invented till about the year 1242. The cross
ing of wide oceans was therefore a thing that could not be done
Navigators seldom dared to stretch forth upon the boundless sea;
they only ventured to creep carefully along the shores, always keeping the land in sight.
7. As navigation improved, mankind grew more adventurous upon
the sea; and, by degrees, their knowledge of the world -its seas
and oceans, its shores and continents- was so far increased, that the
Old World, or the eastern hemisphere, was tolerably well understood. The idea had also occurred to many individuals, that the
great oceans probably contained large masses of yet undiscovered
land.
8. It seems to be the course of Providence to make a gradual
development of that knowledge which is important to man; and
when any great revelation, or any great discovery, is needful, the
means of effecting the desired object are provided. The time had
at length arrived for dispelling the mystery which had hitherto
brooded over the mighty seas; and Christopher Columbus, the instrument of accomplishing this great work, was born and trained for his
career.
9. It was he who not only discovered America, but made it known
to the people of the Eastern Continent. The discovery was so new,
vast and surprising, that the land he had found seemed like another
world; and accordingly it was called the New World.
CHAPTER II.
A geographical sketch of America.
1. BEFORE we proceed to recount the history of America, it will
be well to fix definitely in our minds an outline of its geography.
As history details what things have happened, geography informs us
where they happened. It is impossible to have a clear idea of the
former, without a knowledge of the latter.

7. Captain Wadsworth was interrupted no more by Governor
Fletcher. The latter soon made the best of his way back to New
York, where he had more authority than he was soon likely to obtain
over the Connecticut militia.
CHAPTER LIV.
Religion in the colonzes.
A chuzrch in early times, and a Puritan preacher.
1. GOVERNOR FLETCHER was more successful in another direction
than he had been at the east. The king, in 1693, having taken the
government of Pennsylvania into his own hand, Fletcher was placed
over that colony as well as New York.  Here he met with no opposition.
2. Indeed, he was not without merit. For, to say nothing at present of what he did for the promotion of common education, he was at
great pains to introduce public worship into the provinces hlie governed,
especially New York. The Episcopal church was his favorite; and
he did much to introduce Episcopal ministers and build churches in
the province.
3. Religion, as we have seen, had been introduced into most of the
colonies from the very first. The colonies of New England, however, were greatly distinguished for their piety, and especially for a
pious and learned ministry.  As early as 1642, a number of ministers

had been sent for to go to Virginia.  Others were sent for, in l(/8,
to go to the West Indies.
4. The Dutch Reformed Church was introduced into New York
with its first settlers. The Mennonites came to Pennsylvania in 1692.
The Tunkers, or General Baptists, arrived in 1719. The Moravians
came over in 1741. Whitefield came over in 1742, and though he
did not found a sect, he exerted much influence. The Shakers first
reached America in 1774.
5. The progress and decline of infidelity will be mentioned in connection with the history of the country during the revolutionary war
and subsequently to that period. It revived again, soon after the close
of the second war, which ended in 1815, but in other and often less
odious forms.
6. The first Wesleyan Methodist society in the United States was
formed in New York, as late as 1766, by some Irish emigrants. They
soon irncereased rapidly; at present their number is very great. The
Methodists are not generally Calvinists, though we sometimes hear
of Calvinistic Methodists.
7. The Universalists made their appearance about the year 1760;
though John Murray, their principal leader, did not arrive till 1770.
They are most numerous in Massachusetts, Maine, and the other
eastern states.
8. The first church at Boston was built in the year 1632, by the
two congregations of Boston and Charlestown; neither of the two
being able to erect it alone. It had mud walls and a thatched roof,
and stood on the south side of State street.
9. In 1642, from thirty to forty churches had been erected, and a
greater number of ministers' houses built. The progress of these
things was not so great immediately after this period. The long and
tedious Indian wars made the people feel poor. In 1700 there were
only about one hundred and twenty ministers in all New England.
In 1760 they had increased to five hundred and thirty.
10. The Westminster Assembly of Divines, in 1642, sent an invitation to some of the ministers in the New England colonies, but they
did not attend their meeting. The next year an attempt was made
by the Assembly of Divines to establish the Presbyterian government
in New England, in place of the Congregational, but it did not succeed.
11. The Cambridge Platform, as it was called, was adopted by
the churches in 1648. The Saybrook Confession of Faith, sometimes
called the Saybrook Platform, was adopted in Connecticut in 1708.

1ClEDUCATION IN THE COLONIES.
CHAPTER LVT.
Education in the colonies.
1. ONE of the first acts passed by the Pennsylvania assembly, after
Governor Fletcher came into office, was an act requiring all parents
and guardians to have their children instructed in reading and writing,
and taught some useful trade.
2. The subject of education had not been forgotten in the other
colonies. As early as 1619, a college for Indian children had been
contemplated in Virginia, to be located at Henrico; and, in 1621,
measures were taken to connect with it a free school, and to extend
its benefits to the children of the settlers; and soon, fifteen hundred
pounds sterling, with large grants of land, had been appropriated to
each purpose.
3. Harvard College was founded in 1638, by Rev. John Harvard,
a minister; and something had been done for the encouragement of
reading and writing in the colony - not excepting the Indian children.
Catholic Maryland had even spread among the people books of devotion, and encouraged the formation of libraries.
4. The college of William and Mary, in Virginia, was founded in
1692. Maryland passed laws in favor of free schools in 1694 and ia
1696. Yale College was founded in 1701, and the college at Princeton, in New Jersey, in 1738. A grammar school was established in
New York in 1702, and a free school in Charleston, South Carolina,
in 1712. An Indian charity school, founded at Lebanon, Connecticut,
about the year 1760, was, in the year 1770, removed to Hanover, New
Hampshire; and, by a large grant of land and a charter of incorporation, became, in the end, Dartmouth College.
5. In 1740, George Whitefield laid the foundation of an Orphan
House, a few miles from   Savannah, in Georgia, and afterwards
finished it at great expense. It was designed to be an asylum for
poor children, who were to be clothed and fed, and educated in religious knowledge, free of expense. The institution, however, did not
flourish.
6. Something was early done in the colonies for libraries. A considerable library was given to the Free School, in Virginia, by Rev.
Thomas Bangave. Subscription libraries were, however, first set on
foot by Dr. Franklin, in the year 1731.

102THE WAR OF QUEEN ANNE.
CHAPTER LVI.
The WVar of Queen Anne.
1. BUT we must return to the wars of the colonies. The winter
before the close of King William's war had been unusually severe.
This, added to the expense and losses of a long and tedious war, produced a state of very great suffering. Everything, for man or beast,
was scarce and dear, and every day becoming still more so.
2. And yet only five years passed away, before another French
and Indian war broke out, little less dreadful than the former. It
began in 1702, and continued till 1713, a period of eleven years;
though for the first four or five years it was chiefly confined to skirmishing on the one part, and to plundering, burning, capturing and
murdering on the other.  
3. But, in 1707, another expedition was fitted out against Port
Royal. It consisted of one thousand men. They sailed from Nantucket  Little, however, was accomplished, except to exasperate
the enemy and increase the suffering on our frontiers. A land
expedition against Cannda, made with three thousand men, in 1708,
also failed.
4. But the idea of reducing Port Royal was not yet given up by
the colonists.  After repeated applications to Eng]and for help,
Colonel Nicholson was sent over with a fleet, who, with the aid of
a few regiments of troops, from New England, invaded and took it,
and changed the name of the place to Annapolis, in honor of the
queen.
5. Encouraged by this success, another attackc was planned against
Canada. A fleet came over from England, but they were without
provisions enough to last them a single mbnth. The colonies supplied them with every necessary- both provisions and men. Fifteen
ships of war, forty transports, and six store-ships, with seven thousand men, soon sailed from Boston.
6. But this mighty armament, in proceeding up the Bay of the St.
Lawrence, was misdirected by its pilots, and dispersed by storms. A
part of the transports, with seventeen hundred of the men, were cast
away, and one thousand were lost. A land force of four thousand
men, from Connecticut, New York and New Jersey, which was to
cross the country by way of Lake George, and unite with them, hearing the sad news, returned home again.
7. This last failure was charged by England on the colonies, but
the charge was unfounded. They had done their part, and much
more. They had not only furnished most of their own troops, at

their own expense, but they had done a great deal towards sustaining
the forces sent over by the mother country.
8. The French and the Indians, all this while, continued their
depredations. Along the extended frontiers of Maine and New
Hampshire, the attacks were so frequent and the murders so numerous, that one half the whole body of the militia were continually on
duty.
9. The reader may be anxious to know what half the militia, at
this early period, would amount to. Massachusetts, the most thickly
settled of the colonies, had a population, in 1710, of about eighty
thousand. The population of all the colonies was estimated at two
hundred and sixty thousand. From these data we may conjecture
the number of the militia, but have no exact statement of the number.
CHAPTER LVII.
The War at the South.
1. Tins war of Queen Anne had been declared against Spain as
well as France; and the colonies of the south, from their nearness to
the Spanish settlements in that region, had their full share of its
expenses, dangers, and sufferings. They, too, had Indians on their
borders, which fact, of itself, describes their condition.
2. An expedition had been fitted out by Governor Moore, of the
South Carolina settlement, almost before hostilities had begun elsewhere, against Florida. He had sailed, with twelve hundred colonists and Indians, to take St. Augustine. This, it was supposed,
would give him the key of the province, and, perhaps, unlock to him
treasures of gold and silver.
3. But he found greater difficulty in taking St. Augustine than had
been expected. The town was, indeed, soon conquered, but the fort
held out for some time. For want of a proper understanding between
the officers commanding the land and naval forces employed, he was
at length obliged to raise the siege and return.
4. This, to the colony, was not only a failure, but worse, if possible, than mere failure. It involved the infant settlement in an immense debt, to get rid of which, they resorted to a paper currency, as
Massachusetts had already done in circumstances somewhat similar;
and subjected themselves to all its evil consequences.
5. A more successful expedition was made, soon after, against the
Apalachian Indians. They had become quite hostile and troublesome, and Governor Moore, in order to chastise them, led his troops
into the very heart of their country, burnt their villages and towns,
mrnade six hundred or eight hundred of them prisoners, and compelled
the rest to submission.

6. In 1607, the tide of war, in this quarter, became turned, and
the Spaniards and French invaded Carolina, with a view to annex it
to Florida. Governor Johnson had succeeded Governor Moore, and
was a more efficient warrior. By his prompt and energetic movements, the assailants were defeated, and the Carolinas became able,
in their turn, to attack their invaders, and to make some captures.
7. About the year 1710, a body of six hundred and fifty German
emigrants settled on the Roanoke river, in North Carolina. They
were called Palatinates. They had been stripped of their property
by the ravages of war in Europe, and by the benevolence of their
countrymen had found their way to America. Three thousand of the
same class came at once to New York.
8. The settlers on the Roanoke were hleaded by one Baron Graffenried, a Swiss, who called the place where they settled New Bern,
in honor of his native city. These colonists were among the best and
most worthy citizens who had as yet made their appearance in the
United States.
9. But the savages, whenever their vengeance is aroused, do not
discriminate very nicely between good and bad citizens. They fell
upon the poor Palatinates in their houses, and butchered one hundred
and thirty-seven of them in a single night. The militia rallied, drove
them back, and kept them in check till they could send for help to
South Carolina.
10. Governor Craven, of the latter colony, soon despatched, for
their relief, a body of six hundred militia and three hundred and
seventy friendly Indians, who, attacking the enemy with great
energy, killed eight hundred, made one hundred prisoners, and pursued the rest to their own settlements, where, after destroying some
six hundred or seven hundred more of them, and burning their huts
they compelled them to make peace.
11. The colonies at the north were also relieved, in March, 1713
but the relief came from a distant quarter. A peace was concluded
between France and England. They were not, however, immediately delivered from the depredations of the Indians. They continued
their barbarities two years longer, and many hundreds of valuable
lives were sacrificed.

Yamasees. These Indians, becoming somehow or other excited,
devised a plot to destroy the colony. They had also drawn into their
scheme every other tribe of Indians, from Cape Fear to Florida.
2. On the 15th of April, 1715, about break of day, they came upon
the village of Pocotaligo and the plantations around, and murdered, in
a very short time, above ninety persons. The news soon reached
Port Royal, the nearest village of any considerable size, and a vessel
happening to be in the harbor, the inhabitants all went on board, and
sailed for Charleston.
3. The Indians came on, and, but for their timely escape, would,
no doubt, have massacred the whole of them. A few families on
scattered plantations, who had not time to get on board, were all
either killed or captured. The tribes in the north, towards North
Carolina, also began a work of destruction in that region.
4. So great was the danger that many began to fear for the safety
of Charleston. The governor ordered out every man in the city and
neighborhood who was able to bear arms, except the slaves, and even
some of the most trusty of these were enrolled; and the most vigorous efforts were made to defend the place, and successfully prosecute
the war.
5. Meanwhile, the Indians on the northern frontier had gained
some advantages over the colonists. Captain Barker, with a party
of ninety horsemen, had been drawn into an ambush, and many of
his men slain. Another party of seventy whites and forty negroes
had surrendered and been afterwards murdered.
6. The alarm increasing, Governor Craven sent to Virginia for aid,
and even to England.  He put the whole country under martial law,
and forbade any ships leaving the province. He also ordered bills of
credit to be issued to pay the troops, already amounting to twelve
hundred men.
7. But he did not act merely upon the defensive. He marched
slowly and cautiously against the Yamasees. Arriving at a place
called the Saltcatchers, he attacked them in their camp. Here was
fought, from behind trees and bushes, one of the most severe and
bloody battles which had ever been fought in the provinces, and the
issue was for a long time doubtful.
8. The Indians were several times repulsed; but they seemed
numerous as grasshoppers in the woods, and fresh bodies of them
continually came on to the attack. At last the governor was victorious. He drove them from their camp, and pursued them across the
Savannah river, and slew great numbers.  The few who survived
went to Florida, and joined the Spaniards.
9. What number of the colonial troops were killed, in this bloody
battle, history does not say. Four hundred were slain, in all, during
the war. But the defeat of the savages was decisive.  Several forts
were, indeed, erected on the frontiers against them, but they did not
return to molest the settlers any more.

106THE AMERICAN PIRATES.                   107
CHAPTER LIX.
The American Pirates.
Wreck of the Whidah.
1. IN the year 1717, a remarkable shipwreck took place on the
shores of Cape Cod. The vessel in question was the Whidah, a
ship of twenty-three guns and one hundred and thirty men, commanded by Samuel Bellamey. More than one hundred dead bodies
of the men floated on shore. Six escaped with their lives, but were
afterwards taken and executed.
2. This pirate vessel had long been troublesome on the coast of
New England. She had made many captures and was greatly feared,
and no one was sorry for her loss. But she was not the only piratical
vessel on the coast. The Atlantic Ocean had been infested with
sea robbers for many years.
3. Among the more distinguished of these lawless plunderers of
the ocean was William Kidd. The people of England, wishing to
suppress piracy, about the year 1696 sent out Captain Kidd for
this purpose. But he turned pirate himself, and after infesting the
seas three years, he returned to the eastern end of Long Island, and
anchored in Gardener's Bay.
4. Here and in other places he is said to have buried great quantities of treasure, which he had stolen on the ocean. But how many
of the stories concerning him are true, and how many fabulous, is
uncertain. Only twenty thousand dollars of his hidden treasure were
ever found. The most we know with certainty is, that there was

such a pirate as Kidd, and that he was taken in Boston, in 1699, sent
to England, tried, condemned, and in 1701 executed.
5. In 1700, the year that Kidd was sent to England, the coast of
Carolina was greatly disturbed by pirates. In a quarrel among themselves, nine were turned adrift in a long-boat, and, on getting ashore,
were taken, carried to Charleston, tried, and seven of them executed.
6. Still the pirates continued to be troublesome along the whole
Atlantic border. In the West Indies their depredations had been
checked by the English; but off the coast of North Carolina they
were still very numerous, and committed many acts of robbery.
7. One vessel, with thirty men, was taken and carried into Charlestonl, and the crew tried and condemned. Another vessel was taken,
but the pirates were all slain, except two, before they would surrender. The survivors of both vessels were executed. One historian says the whole number put to death at this period was fortytwo.
8. But the decisive blow against them was not struck till the year
1723. This year the Greyhound man-of-war took a crew of twentyfive, and carried them into Rhode Island, where, upon trial, they were
found guilty, and sentenced to be executed. Their execution took
place at Newport, July 19.
CHAPTER LX.
Settlement of Georgia.
1. IN 1732, the country between the Savannah and the Altamaha
rivers was granted by George II. to General Oglethorpe and a company of twenty-one others, as trustees for the establishment of a
colony in Georgia, in America.  The first colony which was sent
over consisted of one hundred and fourteen men, women and children:
and they arrived at Charleston in January, 1733.
2. The people of Charleston received them with great kindness,
and did all they could to aid them in getting forward to their new
residence. The legislature voted them one hundred and four head of
cattle, twenty-five hogs, and twenty barrels of rice. They also furnished them with a small body of troops to protect them while surveying the country and building habitations.

a few days after their arrival, to explore the country they intended
to settle in, and landed near Yamacraw Bluff. On this bluff Gen.

Oglethorpe marked out a town, and called it Savannah; and, by the
9th of February, they were ready to erect buildings.
4. For some time, however, the colony did not flourish. The
trustees had ordered that all lands bought or held by the settlers
should go back to the original owner, in case the settler had no male
heirs. Nor were they allowed to import rum, or trade with the
Indians, or make use of negroes.
5. Beneficial as a part of these prohibitions must undoubtedly
have been, it is highly probable that the condition in regard to the
descent of property did harm.    The people remained poor, and
seemed to lack enterprise. Other inducements were at last held out
to settlers, and not without success. In the course of three years
fourteen hundred planters joined the colony.
6. At length, the passion for conquest, or at least for power,
began to spring up. In 1740, only eight years after the settlemrnent
of the colony, General Oglethorpe, as commander-in-chief of the
forces of South Carolina and Georgia, at the head of two thousand
men, marched to Florida, and, having taken a few small forts,
besieged St. Augustine; but, after some time and much loss, he was
obliged to raise the siege.
7. In 1742, the Spaniards, in their turn, invaded Georgia with
thirty-two sail of vessels and three thousand men. They did not,
however, accomplish their object.   General Oglethorpe was too
skilful for them.  To rid himself of his invaders, he adopted a stratagem.

10GEOGRAPHY OF AMERICA.                       1  
2. On the succeeding page is a map of America, which, you
observe, lies between Europe and Africa on the east, and Asia on
the west. The Pacific Ocean is 10,000 miles across in the widest
part; and the Atlantic, about 3000 miles. Columbus had to cross
this latter ocean, to find America.
3. The continent of America consists of two great masses of land,
united by a narrow strip of land, called the Isthmus of Darien. The
southern p rtion is called South America; the northern, North
America. The West Indies, consisting of a great number of fine
and fruitful islands, lie almost between North and South America;
and it was these that Columbus first discovered.
4. The whole length of the American continent is about 9000
miles, or a little more than one third of the circumference of the
globe, which is about 25,000 miles. The figure below will show
this. The whole length of the eastern continent, from north to
south, is about 7000 miles.
5. The surface of the earth is supposed to contain nearly
200,000,000 of square miles: about three fourths, or 150,000,000,
are water; the rest, 50,000,000, are land. The following table
shows that America contains a little less than one third of all the land
on the globe.
The eastern continent has about 31,000,000 square miles of land.
The western continent hlas about 15,000,000 square miles.
The islands of the Pacific, about 4,000,000 square miles.
6. America is distinguished for the grand scale upon which its
natural features are formed: it has the largest masses of fresh water
lakes; the most extensive valleys; by far the largest rivers; the
knIow geography before history? 2. Between what oceans is America. How wide is

CAPTURE OF LOUISBURG.
them and gone to the Spaniards, Gen. O. feared he would inform
them how weak his forces were, and thus encourage them to prosecute
the war. To prevent this, he endeavored to make the Spanriards
think the deserter was a Georgian spy. He, therefore, wrote to him
as a spy, and bribed one of the captive Spaniards, whom he had in
his camp, to carry the letter.
9. In this letter he had directed the deserter to tell the Spanish
general that the Georgian forces were weak and feeble, and urge him
on to an immediate attack. But, if unsuccessful in this, he wished
him, if possible, to remain with the troops, where they were, three
days longer, as he expected within that time six British ships of war
and two thousand troops from Carolina.
10. This letter, as was intended, fell into the hands of the Spanish
general, and the deserter was put in irons. A council of war being
called, lo! three ships appeared in sight.  Believing them  the
British ships of war which were expected, they burnt the fortress
and fled in confusion, leaving behind them their cannon and stores.
11. Such glaring deception in an officer and magistrate, even in
time of war, may startle the conscientious reader -and so it ought.
But he must remember that almost all kinds of iniquity are tolerated
in war. People will do almost anything to save themselves or theiv
country. Hence the obvious and certain tendency of war to immorality.
CHAPTER LXI.
Capture of Louisburg.
1. By the treaty of 1713, the French had given up Nova Scotia
and Newfoundland to Great Britain. Finding by experience the
want of a fortress in this region, they had built Louisburg on the
island of Cape Breton. They had been twenty-five years at work
on it, and had made it so strong that it was regarded as a sort of
Gibraltar.
2. Another war having broken out, in 1744, between Great
Britain and France and Spain, the New England colonies soon found
that the French made use of this fortress as a hiding-place for the
privateers which annoyed or took their fishing vessels: they were,
therefore, anxious to get possession of it; and, in 1745, having
privately obtained the sanction of the British ministry, they set themselves at work.
3. A naval force was first got ready for sea. Next, four thousand three hundred and sixty-six men were raised from the various
colonies, and properly equipped.  These forces, aided by Comn.

Warren, a British officer from the West Indies, were soon before
Louisburg. The French were taken by surprise, but they made
every preparation to resist which was in their power.
4. Louisburg was in two divisions -the town and the batteries.
Both, however, were well fortified. The colonists found no great
difficulty in landing and talding possession of the batteries; but to get
possession of the town was quite another thing. It was the last hope
of the French, and was, therefore, resolutely defended.
5. But the assailants, having taken two months' provisions with
them, were determined on a siege. They had captutred the outposts,
and, with these, many implements convenient to them in carrying on
the siege; but there was yet a great work to do. " Rome was not
built in a day;" neither could Louisburg be taken in a day.
6. Between them and the town was a deep morass or swamp,
which horses and oxen could not pass. There had, indeed, been a
draw-bridge over it, but this was now destroyed. Over this morass
it took them fourteen days and nights to transport, their cannon.
But their end was at length gained, and a fire was openiied upon the
town.
7. The siege lasted forty-nine days. Com. Warren was of great
service to the assailants. He not only bqmbarded the town, and did
much in battering down the walls, but he captured one seventy-four
gun-ship with all its men and stores. The town and island surrendered June 17.
8. The capture of this important post was no sooner known in
France than a heavy naval force was despatched to Anierica to retake
it and punish the colonies for their insolence. A fleet of forty ships
of war, fifty-six transports, three thousand five hundred men, and
forty thousand stand of arms, under the direction of the Duke d'Anville, an excellent officer, sailed early in the spring of 1716.
9. When the colonies heard of this armament they were alarmed.
They had made the attack on Louisburg without the public approbation of the mother country; and, though they had gained their end,
they had incurred the displeasure of the French, and would Britain
now protect them from their vengeance?
10. But a Power unseen had already interposed in their behalf.
A violent storm had destroyed some of the vessels and injured others,
and one had returned to France. OnIly two or three of the ships,
and a few of the transports, ever reached Halifax; and the admiral
and vice-admiral both died soon after their arrival. And, though an
attempt was still made to. do something, violent storms prevented the
remnant of the fleet from acting in concert.
11. This expedition being frustrated, nothing of importance was
done except upon the Canadian frontiers, where the French and
Indians were, of course, troublesome. But negotiations, at last,

took place between England and France; a treaty of peace was made,
and the colonies relieved from their anxiety. This was signed at Aix
la Chapelle, in October, 1748.
CHAPTER        LXII.
Progress of Agriculture and Manufactures.
1. THE colonies had been so much involved in the long French
and Indian wars, that agriculture had been, as yet, but little attended
to. The forests were, indeed, cleared, and a large amount of produce was raised, and not a little of it exported to the West Indies
and England.   Still, the more enlightened modes of husbandry were
almost as little known among the English colonies as among the
Dutch.
2. Nor had the arts and manufactures made much greater progress, and for similar reasons. But there was another difficulty with
regard to manufactures. The regulations and prohibitions of the
mother country continually came in their way. It was not Sir Edmund Andros alone that had sought to throw obstacles in their path.
The parliament had done it continually.
3. In 1732, for example, they had passed an act prohibiting the
exportation of American hats, as well as limiting the number of
apprentices taken by hat-makers. Again, in 1750, an act was passed
to check the progress of the iron and steel manufacture, under a
penalty of two hundred pounds sterling.

4. Still, something had been done both in agriculture and manufactures. The introduction of tobacco into Virginia had been effected,
and had been cultivated to a very great extent. Virginia, in 1758, is
said to have exported seventy million pounds. Rye was first harvested in Massachusetts in 1633.
5. The cultivation of the grape, for the manufacture of wine, was
introduced into Virginia in 1622; into South Carolina in 1690; and
into Illinois, by the French settlers, in 1769.
6. Silk-making was introduced into Virginia quite early. In 1669,
the legislature passed an act for its encouragement. It was tried in
South Carolina in 1703. In 1759, the manufacture of silk had
become so common in Georgia, that ten thousand pounds of raw
silk were received in a single year at Savannah; and it brought
half a dollar more a pound, in London, than any other silk.
7. Hemp and flax must have been introduced into Maryland early,
for the legislature passed an act for their encouragement, in 1671.
Hemp was introduced, in 1701, into Massachusetts. Tea began to be
cultivated in Georgria in 1770, but it did not thrive very well. Rice
was introduced into Carolina in 1695.   The exports from   South
Carolina, in 1729, were two hundred and sixty-four thousand, four
hundred and eighty-eight barrels.
8. Cotton, the great staple of the southern Atlantic states, does
not appear to have been cultivated till after the war- viz., in 1788.
Indigo was brought to South Carolina, in 1743, by Miss Lucas.
The Spanish potato was introduced into New England in 1764, but
the Irish kind was here much earlier.
9. The introduction of the art of printing into the colonies has
been mentioned. The Boston News Letter -the first newspaper in
North America - was begun       in  1704, by Bartholomew   Green.
During the next fifty years four more newspapers were established
in New England, four in the Middle States, and two at the south.
Books, also, began to be published.
10. Little was it thought, in 1704, that in 1754 there would be
ten papers in the provinces. Still less was it thought; that, in 1844.
or ninety years later than 1754, the number of periodicals, in the
United States, would be more than twenty-five hundred.

SUFFERINGS OF THE COLONIES.
CHAPTER LXIII.
Sufferings of the colonies.
1. IT is impossible for us, at the present day, to understand the full
extent of the losses and sufferings of the colonies at this early period.
For, when we draw away a few thousand men from our present
population, or a few thousand dollars from a national or state treasury,
the loss is scarcely perceived; but it was far otherwise one hundred
and fifty, or even one hundred years ago.
2. The expenses of New England and New York, in the war of
1744, though it hardly lasted four years, were estimated at over one
million of pounds sterling. Massachusetts herself is said to have
expended four hundred thousand pounds in the expedition against
Louisburg.
3. Here, again, paper money was issued, which seemed to answer,
as it usually does, a very good purpose for the time. But it did
injury in the end. Two or three millions of it were hardly worth
half a million of gold or silver at the first; and, in the end, twenty
pounds in bank notes were only worth about one pound sterling in
good money.
4. The emission of paper money, while it seemed to afford relief,
and, in truth, did afford relief to particular individuals at the time,
was a loss to the whole community. It divided the losses of the
war, it is true, by compelling every man, whether soldier or laborer,
who held the money at the time of its depreciation, to bear his
share.
5. Losses had, moreover, been sustained by sea, as well as by
land, through the odious practice of privateering. Massachusetts
soon learned the art of trading, not only at home, but even with
England and the West Indies. A trade was begun with the West
Indies, as early as 1641,- and, in 1642, the colony had five ships,
already, at sea.  
6. Nor were the other colonies backward to engage in commercial
enterprise. It is mentioned as a great drawback upon the prosperity of the New Haven colony during the first years of its existence, especially about the year 1647, that the trade with the West
Indies was unfortunate and many vessels were lost at sea.
7. But we have other facts on this subject. In 1676, there were,
in the whole of New England, thirty shipwrights. In 1680, Connecticut had twenty-four vessels engaged in trade with Boston and
other places. In 1681, forty-nine trading vessels entered the single
harbor of Portsmouth. And, in 1731, Massachusetts alone had six

hundred sloops and vessels, with five thousand or six thousand men,
engaged in the fisheries.
8. It is easy, then, to see that the losses, by means of privateers,
during a war, to say nothing of the depredations of pirates, must be
very great. But the loss of property, by sea and by land, was not
all. Multitudes of the best of the citizens, of every age, especially
in the prime of life, had fallen in the wars.
9. What the loss of men, women and children, actually was, during
the long French and Indian wars, is not known. The loss of Massachusetts, including Maine and New Hampshire, between the years
1722 and 1749, when there was as little war as at any period of
twenty-seven years after the settlement of the country, has been supposed to be fifty thousand.
10. No wonder the colonies were glad to enjoy, when it came, the
blessing of peace. No wonder trade and commerce revived, agriculture flourished, and the arts and manufactures made progress.
What a pity the peace between the nations could not have been
permanent! How    strange that the early history of the United
States, like that of almost every nation, should be, as it were, but e
series of wars and sufferings!
CHAPTER LXIV.
Discoveries in the West.
1. IT is time, now, to attend to the history of the great West.
The travels of Ferdinand de Soto have been mentioned. He saw
and crossed the great Mississippi; but the French, under Joliet and
Marquette, two Canadians, first explored it, together with some of
its principal branches, such as the Fox, Wisconsin, Arkansas, and
Illinois. This was a little before the time of Philip's war.
2. In 1679, M. de La Salle, a French Canadian officer, equipped
a small vessel at the lower end of Lake Erie, nearly opposite where
Buffalo now stands, and, in company with Louis Hennepin, a friar,
and thirty-four other persons, explored the shores of several of the
northern lakes, and, having built a small fort, wintered near the
mouth of the Maumee river.
3. The next spring they set out again, and travelled among the
Illinois Indians. Their travels, the year before, had given them muck
knowledge of the Indian character. They crossed the wilderness to
the Illinois river, a journey of four days, with their canoes and provisions upon their shoulders, and then descended it.
4. In passing along, down the river, they came to an Indian village

NOTE. -In looking at a map of our country, representing it as it now is, we see that
the valley of the Mississippi and the region of the Great Lakes are occupied by several
large states and territories. These are as follows: the states of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana,
Illinois, and the territories of Iowa and Wisconsin, at the north.
South of these, are Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana
and Alabama. Between these territories and the Rocky Mountains, is a vast space,
occupied by the Indians; and west of the Rocky Mountains is the territory of Oregon,
which borders on the Pacific Ocean.
This whole region, occupying nearly three fourths of the present territory of the
United States, was almnost entirely unsettled until about the period of the Revolutionary
War

of five hundred huts, but without inhabitants. Going on about one
hundred miles further, they suddenly found themselves in the midst of
a host of Indian warriors, on both sides of the river, who offered them
battle. The company made signs of peace, howevpr, and soon quieted
their fears.
La Salle on his exploring expedition.
5. More than even this was accomplished. The curiosity of the
Indians was awakened and their friendship secured, and our travellers
concluded to remain among them for a time. Accordingly, they
built a small fort and made it their residence. But the men grew
tired of the place, and not only tired, but mutinous against La Salle.
They even tried to excite the prejudices of the Indians against
him.
6. La Salle found it easier to regain the confidence of the savages
than that of his own men. They were, still, uneasy, and at length
laid a plan to destroy him and some of his strongest friends, by
mixing poison with their food. The poisoned food, in fact, made
them sick, but they all recovered.
7. Early in the spring of 1680, La Salle set out again on his journey down the river. On reaching its mouth, they sailed up the Mississippi almost to its source.  The voyage occupied them    many
months.   On the 8th of November he set out for home.
8. In returning, however, they passed through the country where
they had seen the destitute Indian village.  While in this region they
mnet with new troubles, on account of the hostility of the Iroqnois tribe
of Indians, and Father Hennepin came near losing his life.  They
escaped, finally, without any injury.

time, and, also, down the Mississippi. Here he encountered many
dangers, and had many hair-breadth escapes, especially from the
Natchez tribe of Indians. They reached the mrouth of the river on
the 7th of April. La Salle is supposed to have been the first white
man who ever navigated the Mississippi for any considerable distance.
10. Here, standing together on the shore of the Gulf of Mexico,
at the end of a voyage of two thousand miles, in small open boats, on
an unknown stream, whose banks were lined with savages, the party
united in thanking God for their preservation, and in singing a hymn
together, after which they prepared for themselves a temporary
shelter.
11. On the 11th of April, they set out on their return up the river,
visiting the Indians as they passed along. They reached Michilimackinac in the month of September, soon after which La Salle sailed
for Quebec, and thence to France, to make a report of his discoveries
to the king.
12. He returned once more to America, but not to the north. He
undertook to explore the country about the mouth of the Mississippi,
where, after many curious adventures and not a few discoveries, he
was basely murdered, about the year 1686, by one of his companions.
CHAPTER LXV.
Settlements in the TWest.
1. FATHER HENNEPIN resumed his travels in the west after La
Salle's death, bult made no permanent settlements. La Salle and he
had, however, paved the way for other adventurers and fur-traders,
and ultimnately for emigrants. The French claimed the country on
both sides of the Mississippi, and, in fact, all the way from the Gulf
of Mexico to Canada.
2. The first permanent settlement in the great Mississippi valley,
as it is now called, was at Kaskaskia, in Illinois -perhaps about
1688 or 1690; for the year is not exactly known. There were,
indeed, military forts there as early as 1687; certainly one where St.
Louis now stands.
3. The second known white settlement - the first in the Louisiana
country -was made by D'Ibervi]le, of Canada, in May, 1699, with
forty or fifty,men, at the bay of Biloxi. It did not flourish, but paved
the way to better things. Pensacola, in Florida, was begun about

the same time. Detroit, in Michigan, was settled in June, 1701. A
settlement was made on the Mobile river, in 1702, and at New
Orleans in 1717.
Settlement at Kaskaskia.
4. The settlements in the Mississippi valley received a terrible
eneck in the year 1729. The warlike tribe of Indianiis, called the
Natchez, having become excited against the French, seized their
opportunity and murdered all the settlers they could find. Of seven
hundred or more, scarcely enough survived to carry the tidings to
New Orleans.
5. But, instead of giving up the country, the French troops, in
New Orleans and elsewhere, only meditated revenge. - They pursued
the Natchez, till they had driven them to their villages and forts,
where they fell upon them and cut them to pieces. The few who
survived were made slaves of, and the tribe perished.
6. By about the year 1730, the French had a line of forts and settlemnents all the way from New Orleans to Quebec. They had even
ascended the Ohio, and built a fort where Pittsburg now stands,
which they called Fort du Quesne. The English colonists were jealous of their movements, and their jealousy, at length, ripened into
hostility.
7. A trading company, called the Ohio Company, was formed in
the year 1749, consisting of English and Virginia merchants, whose
object it was to trade with the Indians for furs. They had obtained
a grant of six hundred thousand acres of land, near the river Ohio.
This, in turn, raised the jealousy of the governor of Canada, and he
ordered the traders to be seized.

as it was then called, on Lake Erie, where the town of Erie now

7. The climate of America, along the Atlantic coast, is colder than
that of the Eastern Hemisphere; the vegetation is nearly the same.
The original animals of America differ in species from those of the
eastern world. We have here no native elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, giraffe, tiger, leopard, or lion. Our domestic animals, with
the single exceptions of the dog and turkey, are wholly of European
origin.

stands, and Fort du Quesne, at the head of the Ohio, and stationed
troops and built fortifications along this line. His object, in short,
was to break up the trade of the Ohio Company, and hold the
country.
9. The company complained of the French to Governor Dinwiddie, of Virginia, who laid the subject before the general assem
bly. T'hey ordered a messenger to be sent to the French commander, to inquire into the cause of the severe measures which were
pursued, and to ask that the forts might be evacuated and the troops
removed.
CHAPTER LXVI.
George Washington begins his public career.
1. THE   messenger intrusted with this important errand was
George Washington, then scarcely twenty-one years of age. He
was a Virginian by birth, and had received no other education than
that of the family and the common school.  Yet his mind, at school,
had taken quite a mathematical turn; and he hlEad early become a
surveyor.

them. At the age of nineteen he had been made an adjutant general
of some troops, raised for the defence of the country against the Indians, and had the rank of major; but he had never been called into
service.
3. This was the individual selected by Governor Dinwiddie for
an expedition at once difficult and dangerous. Several young men,
to whom the commission had been offered, refused it, for want of
courage to engage in the undertaking. But Washington was born
to save his country, and not solely to seek his own ease and comfort.
4. He set out on his journey from Williamsburg, the capital of
Virginia, October 31, 1753.  He had with him an Indian interpreter,
a French interpreter, a guide, and four other persons, two of whom
were Indian traders; making, in all, a company of eight men, with
their horses, tents, baggage and provisions.
5. The distance from Williamsburg to the principal fort of the
French was about five hundred and fifty miles. They were to pass
high and rugged mountains and cross deep rivers. Half the distance,
moreover, was through a pathless wilderness, where no traces of civilization had yet appeared, and where, perhaps, none but savages and
wild beasts had ever trodden.
6. But danger did not move Washington where duty was concerned. He pursued his way and performed the services assigned
him; and if the mission did not prevent a war from breaking out,
it was, at least, satisfactory to him to know that he had done what he
could. He received the thanks of the governor and council of Virginia for his services.
7. Some few anecdotes of this journey are worth relating. On
their return homeward, Washington was shot at by a French Indian,
but, though the savage was not fifteen paces off, according to Washington's own statement, and probably meant to kill him, not the
slightest injury was done him.
8. Again, as they were obliged to cross the rivers on rafts, and in
such other ways as they could, and as it was winter, they sometimes
narrowly escaped being drowned. In one instance they were wrecked
on an island, and obliged to remain there all night; the cold, in the
mean time, being so intense that the hands and feet of the guide were
frozen.
9. In another instance, while descending a river in a canoe, perplexed by rocks, shallows, drifting trees and currents, they came to a
lace where the ice had lodged, which made it impassable by water.
They were, consequently, obliged to land and carry their canoe across
a neck of land for a quarter of a mile or more.

12113ITTLE AT THE GREAT MEADOWS
CHAPTER LXVII.
Battle at the Great Meadows.
1. THE French continuing their aggressions, the British ministry
encouraged the colonies, especially Virginia, to arm themselves and
resist them in the best way they could. This was in the beginning
of the year 1754, two years before the British and French camne to an
open rupture, by what has usually been called the "French and English war."
2. Virginia raised a regiment of two or three companies, of whom
Washington was made lieutenant-general. The case was thought an
urgent one, and, as the chief officers in command did not arrive, nor
any aid from the other colonies, though it had been promised, Washington, with his little army, boldly entered the wilderness.
3. On the 28th of May, at a place called the Red Stones, they came
up with a party of the French and Indians, whom they attacked and
defeated, killing ten or twelve, and taking twenty-two prisoners.
From the prisoners, he learned that the French forces on the Ohio
amounted to a thousand regular troops, besides Indians. Nothing
daunted, however, he continued his march.
4. At a place called the "Great Meadows" he halted and built a
fort, calling it Fort Necessity. Here he waited a long time for troops
from the other colonies; but none came, except a company of one
hundred independents from South Carolina. The forces now amounted
to four hundred men.
5. On the 3d of July, Washington received information that the
whole body of French and Indians were marching to attack him. At
eleven o'clock they arrived, and commenced their assault. They were
met, however, with a bravery that could hardly have been expected
from troops so inexperienced.
6. The battle lasted from eleven in the forenoon, to eight in the
evening. "Scarcely, since the days of Leonidas and his three hundred deathless Spartans," says Trumbull, in his "Indian Wars,"
"had the sun beheld its equal. With hideous whoops and yells, the
enemy came on like a host of tigers. The woods and rocks and tall
tree-tops, as the Indians climbed into them to pour down their
bullets into the fort, were in one continued blaze and crash of firearms.
7. Nor were the young Virginians idle. Animated by their chief,
they plied their rifles with so much spirit that their 1lttle fort seemed
a volcano in full blast, roaring and discharging its thick sheets of
liquid death. For full nine hours, salamander like, enveloped in
smoke and flame, they sustained the shock, and laid two hundred of
the enemy on the field.

8. Discouraged by such desperate resistance, Count de Villiers, the
French commander, sent in a flag of truce, extolling their gallantry,
and offering to treat with them on the most honorable terms. They
were to give up the fort, but the troops were to be permitted to march
away with all the honors of war, carrying with them their stores and
baggage. The terms were accepted, and, accordingly, they left the
fort early the next morning.
9. Although the French commander had promised that the Virginia troops should not be molested, they had not retreated far, before
a party of a hundred Indians came upon them and robbed them of a
part of their baggage. They soon arrived, however, without any further loss of life, at Williamsburg.
10. A vote of thanks was passed, by the legislature, to Colonel
Washington and his brave companions, and a pistole granted to each
of the soldiers; for, although defeated, they had conducted bravely,
Of the three hundred Virginians engaged in the defence of the fort,
only twelve had been killed.
CHAPTER LXVIII.
Defeat of Braddock, 4yc.
1. THE French and Indians continuing their depredations on the
frontiers of the colonies, the British ministry, without formally declaring war, encouraged the colonists to defend themselves, and to unite
for the purpose. They accordingly sent delegates, who met at Albany, in 1754, and a plan of union was adopted, not very unlike the
present federal constitution.
2. This plan, or system, was signed by Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland,
July 4, the very day of Washington's retreat from Fort Necessity.
Connecticut alone refused to sign it. It was also disliked, in some
of its features, by the colonial assemblies and the members of the
councils.
3. Early in 1755, the colonies proceeded to attack the French at
four different points -Nova Scotia, Crown Point, Niagara and Ohio
river. The expedition against Nova Scotia, under Generals Monckton and Winslow, was completely successful; the whole country was
subdued, with Ihe loss of only twenty men.
4. The expedition against Crown Point, on Lake Champlain, led
by General Johnson of New York, though a failure as to its main
object, was yet honorable to the officers and men who were employed
in it. In a great battle fought near Whitehall, seven hundred of the

French were killed and three hundred wounded, while the whole loss
of the colonies scarcely exceeded two hundred.
5. It was at this battle that a noble French officer, by the name of
Dieskau, was wounded and taken prisoner. He was shot in the leg,
and, being unable to retreat, was taken by an English soldier. Fearing for his safety, he was feeling for his watch to give it up to the
soldier, when the latter, supposing him to be feeling for his pistol,
inflicted a deep wound in his hips. He was treated with great kindness, but died soon afterwards.
6. The expedition against Niagara, with twenty-five hundred men,
under Governor Shirley, of Massachusetts, was begun too late in the
year. The troops proceeded no further than Oswego, on Lakle Ontario, when the proposed attack was abandoned. No more attempts
were made, in this quarter, till after the declaration of war, which
took place June 9, of the next year.
7. In the operations against the French, on the Ohio, there was
not only a want of success, but a signal failure in the memorable
defeat of General Braddock, whom the British had sent over, in February, with two thousand men, to the aid of the colonies. He was
an aged and experienced officer; one who not only thought well of
himself, but was thought well of by others.
8. No sooner had he arrived than the Virginian Assembly raised
a body of eight hundred men to join him, and Washington agreed
to serve as his aid de camp.  The army mnarched without being
molested till they were within seven miles of Fort du Quesne now

most important service. The troops being in want of a suitable number of wagons to transport their baggage, Franklin persuaded the
farmers of Pennsylvania to let them have both wagons and horses.
In the end, the wagons and horses were lost, and Franklin was
expected to pay for them. The damage was about one hundred thousand dollars.
10. Franklin would have paid the debt had he been able, but he
was not.   He had advanced considerable money already.     The
owners of the horses and wagons at last began to sue him. The
government, however, at length, interposed, as they ought, and paid
the debt.
11. But to return to General Braddock. On the morning of July
9, when within a few miles of Pittsburg, a large party of French
and Indians were discovered in ambush. Washington now, for the
first time, informed General Braddock what sort of an enemy he had
to deal with -an enemy who would fight chiefly from behind hedges
and rocks and trees, where they could not be easily seen.
12. General Braddock, instead of receiving the information with
gratitude, was only angry, and said it was high times when a young
Virginian could teach a British general how to fight. He would not
even grant the modest request of Washington to let him place himself at the head of the Virginian riflemen, and fight the savages in
their own way.
13. Washington bit his lips with anguish, for he knew, too well,
what would be the result. The troops were soon assailed on all sides,
not by an enemy whom they could see and meet in fair fight, but a foe
which, to them, was invisible. Slain by hundreds, and unable to
resist, they soon fell into confusion, and General Braddock himself
was mortally wounded.
14. Washington, however, was calm. As soon as Braddock'fell,
he placed himself at the head of the Virginian Blues, as they were
called, led them against the enemy, checked their fury, and enabled
the shattered British army to retreat. Braddock lived long enough
to see his folly and to applaud the bravery of the Virginians. But he
died; and Washington, to prevent the savages from disturbing his
remains, buried him in the road, and ordered the wagons, in their
retreat, to drive over his grave.
15. In this battle, the English and the colonists had seven hundred and seventy-seven men killed and wounded, while the enemy
scarcely lost fifty. Washington had four bullets sent through his
clothes, and two horses slain under him, and yet he escaped unhurt.
He again received the thanks of his country, though not in a formal
manner.
16. It was not long after this battle that, near Pittsburg, an Indian
warrior is reported to have said that Washington was not born to be

killed by a bullet; for he had seventeen fair fires at him with his
rifle, during the engagement, and yet, after all, he could not kill him.
Such a sentiment, whether uttered by a savage or invented for the
occasion, seems to have been almost prophetic.
CHAPTER LXIX.
The French and Indian Trar.
Lord Chatham.
I. IN May, 1756, war was declared by Great Britain against
France, in due form. In the full expectation of immediate aid from
the mother country, the colonies laid a plan to take Crown Point and
Niagara, and, for this purpose, raised seven thousand men, and
placed them under the command of General Winslow, of Massachusetts.
2. Governor Shirley had been, for some time past, the commander
of the Massachusetts forces. But now the British ministry appointed
the Earl of Loudon to this office; though, until his arrival, General
Abercrombie was to have the command of the troops of Massachusetts.
But General Abercrombie was an inefficient officer, and nothing decisive was done this year.
3. In the mean time, the Canadian and Indian forces, amounting
to eight thousand men, under General Montcalm, had attacked and
taken Oswego, the American key to Lake Ontario, with sixteen
hundred of our troops, and a large quantity of cannon and military

stores -as signal a disaster to the colonies as could have befallen
thern.
4. Lord Loudon at length arrived in America; and gareat preparation was made in England and America for the campaign of the next
year. In 1757, eleven ships of the line, fifty transports, and six
thousand troops arrived, destined to act against Louisburg, which had
again fallen into the hands of the French. But the attack was delayed till it was so well fortified that it was not thought advisable to
besiege it.
5. General Montcalm, the French commander, in pursuing his successes, had, by this time, besieged and taken Fort William Henry,
on Lake George. Nor did he meet with much resistance, although
General Webb, with four thousand men, lay at Fort Edward, only
fifteen miles off, and evidently knew what was going on.
6. It was a condition, in the surrender of the troops, at Fort
William Henry, that their lives should be spared after the surrender;
and yet the Indians butchered great multitudes -the French officers
pretending they could not restrain them.  Yet they had a regular
force of at least seven thousand men!
7. In 1758, the celebrated Mr. Pitt, or Lord Chatham, was placed
at the head of the British ministry. This event infused a new spirit
into all the affairs of the government, and what was done with regard
to the prosecution of the war in America, was done promptly and
efficiently.
8. He sent letters to all the American governors, requiring thilem
to raise as many troops as they could, at the same time promising to
send a large British force to their aid. The colonies complied with
the request, and Massachusetts, Connecticut and New TT;-nnsDhire,
alone, raised fifteen thousand men. They wYere to be ready for actio.-;'
in May.
9.; The first movement was against Louisburg, in the months of
Tune and July. This fortress, after a stout resistance, surrendered,
%nd, with it, five thousand seven hundred and thirty-seven men. A
-onsiderable amount of cannon also was taken. The whole country,
from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Nova Scotia, fell into the hands of
the English.
10. An attack was next made on Ticonderoga. As Lord London
had returned to England, the expedition was conducted by the inefficient, undecided Abercrombie. Though he had a force of seven
thousand British and nine thousand colonists, and though the garrison
consisted of but three thousand men, he was repulsed, with a loss, in
killed and wounded, of nearly two thousand men.
11. The passage of General Abercrombie over Lake George,
when going to Ticonderoga, is said to have been one of the most
splendid and imposing scenes ever witnessed. The morning was
bright and beautiful, the music fine; the ensigns glittered in the

sunbeams, and a fleet of one thousand and thirty five boats, with sixteen thousand men, moved along in the most exact order.  How
different must have been their return!
12. General Abercrombie, as if to atone for past remissness, now
sent out three thousand men against Fort Frontenac, near the outlet
of Lake Ontario, which, in two days, surrendered. An expedition
was also fitted out against Fort du Quesne, but the French had
evacuated it the evening before they arrived. It was now that it took
the name of Pittsburg.
13. A treaty was made this year at Easton, sixty miles from
Philadelphia, with the principal tribes of Indians between the At]antic and the Rocky Mountains.  No less than five hundred Indian
representatives, including women and children, were present, in their
national costume.
14. Among them were Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas,
Senecas, Tuscaroras, Nanticoques, Conays, Tuteloes, Chugnuts,
Delawares, Unamies, Minisinks, Mohicans and Wappingers. Such
an assembly had not been seen before, since the days of Penn.

mander of the colonial forces, and was a far more efficient officer.
Il July of this year, he led a part of his forces against Ticonderoga
and Crown Point, both of which were taken without much resistance.
2. Another division of the army went against Niagara. Here
was some hard fighting. A serious accident also occurred. General
Prideaux, the English commander, was killed by the bursting of a
gun. He was succeeded in the command by General Johnson, who,
in a few days, gained possession of the post.
3. It now became the great object of the English and American
forces to take Quebec.   It was quite an ancient place, as old,
within one year, as Jamestown, and was strongly fortified. It
was considered almost as difficult to be captured as Louisburg or
Gibraltar.
4. Quebec is on the north-west side of the St. Lawrence, and is
divided into the upper and lower town. The upper town consists of
a high limestone rock, two hundred feet higher than the river; but
the lower town is a plain, almost level with the water. Where the
upper town joins the river is an abrupt precipice, the summit of which
is called the heights of Abraham; around it, or near it, is the plain of
Abraham
5. General Wolfe, a brave and experienced British officer, sailed
from Louisburg, with eight thousand men, in the month of June, to
meet General Amherst there, and attack Quebec. He landed on the
island of Orleans, a little below the city. After many unsuccessful attempts to approach the city, which took up the time till
September, he conceived the bold plan of ascending the heights of
Abraham.
6. After waiting as long for General Amherst as the season would
admit, he resolved to proceed alone. Leaving the island of Orleans,
he first went up the river nine miles; which the French observing,
they immediately detached a part of their forces at Quebec to oppose
his landing in that direction.
7. But he did not mean to land there; he had another end in view.
He was about to attempt what no one before him had ever attempted,
and what the French did not suspect. During the night of September 12, the troops, in flat-bottomed boats, with some difficulty, succeeded in landing at the heights, and, by an hour or two before daylight, had begun to climb the precipice.  -
8. It was no light matter for eight thousand men to climb an
almost perpendicular precipice, of two hundred feet, and draw up
after them all their artillery, baggage, &amp;c. But they persevered,
General Wolfe himself leading the way. At day-break, the whole
army had fairly scaled the heights, and were on the plains of
Abraham.

which passes under the name of New Britain. The United States
contain nearly 2,400,000 square miles, and British America something more.
2. The United States, Mexico, and Guatimala, are independent
countries, with republican governments; the other portions are under
the control of European powers.
3. South America contains Peru, Equador, Venezuela, New Granada, Bolivia, Chili, the Argentine Republic, and Uruguay, all of
which are independent republics. Besides these, there are Brazil,
which is governed by an emperor; Paraguay, under the successors
of the dictator, Francia; Guiana, which belongs to several European powers; and Patagonia, which is only inhabited by tribes of
savages.
4. The West India islands are divided between various European
governments, only one of them, Hayti, being independent. The
principal islands are Cuba, belonging to Spain, and Jamaica, belonging to Great Britain.
5. The whole population of America may be estimated at about
45,000,000. Of these, the largest portion are white people, or the
descendants of Europeans. There are, however, a good many Indians, some partially civilized, and others still maintaining their wild
independence. There are also several millions of negroes, mostly
slaves, and many belonging to a mixture of the white and dark races
CHAPTER IV.
A bird's-eye view of the History of America.
1. THE discovery of Columbus, about 350 years ago, first made
the civilized part of manlind acquainted with America. The people
then occupying the country had no books, and possessed only very
imperfect modes of recording events. Of their history, prior to the
discovery of Columbus, we know but little.
2. The history of America chiefly lies within the compass of the
last 350 years. It shows us that this continent was discovered by
Columbus, under a commission from the king of Spain, who claimed,
as belonging to the Spanish crown, all lands discovered by ships
sailing under the flag of that country.

a stout defence. About the middle of the forenoon, the two armnies
met. A hard-fought battle followed, often contested at the point of
the bayonet, but the English were, at last, victorious.
10. The battle was not only severe, but exceedingly bloody. The
English lost six hundred in killed and wounded, and the French many
more - besides a thousand prisoners. But the loss was most striking
in valuable officers. The commanders of both armies were killed, as
well as the second in command. Two other principal generals of the
French army were also wounded.
11. General Wolfe, who had placed himself in the front of his
army to encourage the troops, received a wound in his wrist, early
in the action, but he wrapped his handkerchief around it, and continued at his post. Soon after, a ball pierced his groin, but he concealed the anguish and fought on. At length. a shot pierced his
breast, and he fell.
12. He did not expire, however, immediately, but lived long
enough to know the issue of the battle. "They fly! they fly!"
said the men, at a little distance, as he leaned, in the agonies of death,
on the shoulders of one of his lieutenants. "Who fly?" said he.
raising, for an instant, his drooping head. Being told it was the
French, "Then," said he, "I die happy."
13. The death of Montcalm; the French commander, was not less
striking. When told that his wound would be fatal in a short time,
he replied, "Then I shall not live to see Quebec surrendered."  He
spent his last moments in writing a letter to the English commander,
recommending the French prisoners to his care and attention.
14. The death of these generals has been the theme of frequent
eulogy - and we cannot deny to them the soldierly merit of courage
and devotion to their cause. But there is a courage occasionally met
with, in the hour of death, of a very different kind, and much more
worthy of being imitated; we mean that moral courage which arises
from the consciousness of being prepared to meet God and an assembled universe, in judgment. The field of battle, however, is not
well adapted to the display of this high quality; nor is the heroism
of the soldier the loftiest exhibition of human virtue.
15. Wolfe was a youngf man- scarcely thirty-three years of age,
and much beloved. Montcalm was something over forty-five. Both
were men of genius and worth. How much is it to be regretted, that
such men cannot spend their lives in deeds of charity and love, rather
than in war!

THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR CONCLUDED.
CHAPTER LXXI.
The French and Indian War concluded, 4c.
1. IMPORTANT to the colonies as were the events described in the
last chapter, they did not end the struggle. The French were still
in possession of a powerful army and many strongly fortified posts.
Indeed, they were not yet reconciled to the loss of Quebec.
2. In April of the ensuing spring, the French approached Quebec with a view to retake it, when General Murray, who had been
left in command of the garrison during the winter, marched out
to meet them. A bloody battle was fought, about three miles from
the city, in which the colonists were defeated with the loss of a thousand men.
3. Though the loss of the French in this battle was twice as great
as that of the English, yet, with their superior numbers, they were
still able to invest the city. Soon after the siege was begun, an
English squadron arrived in the river, which attacked and destroyed a
French fleet of six frigates, and compelled the invading army to raise
the siege.
4. The English and colonists now united all their strength to take
Montreal. They had assembled at its gates a force of more than ten
thousand men, and new troops were daily arriving, when the commander, believing resistance would be useless, surrendered the city.
Detroit and Michilimackinac, and all the fortified posts of Canada, surrendered a few days afterwards.
5. During the campaign of 1759, Major Rogers, with two hundred
men, was sent against the St. Francis Indians. Their principal
town was St. Francis, situated near the river St. Lawrence, about
half way between Montreal and Quebec. Major Rogers succeeded
in burning their town, killing two hundred of their people, and taking
twenty women and children; most of whom he, however, afterward
set free.
6. These St. Francis Indians had been the most barbarous enemies
with which New England had been obliged to contend. They had,
in six years, killed and taken four hundred of the colonists, and hundreds of scalps-were found hanging over the doors of their wigwams
when MAajor Rogers entered the village.
7. But the victory over them, though complete, was dearly bought.
" We marched nine days," says Major Rogers, "through wet,
sunken ground, the water, for most of the way, nearly a foot deep."
In going and returning, and in the battle, he lost about a quarter of
his men.
8. In 1760, there was much trouble with the Cherokee Indians at
the south. A quarrel between them and the Virginians had long

existed, but the French traders, it was supposed, inflamed the minds
of the Indians anew. A detachment of twelve hundred men was
sent out against them, but nothing effectual was accomplished.
9. In 1761, a body of twenty-six hundred mren, under Colone]
Granrt, met them in a great battle, in their own country, in which
the Cherokees were completely defeated. Their houses, magazines
and cornfields were burnt, and they were driven to the mountains. A
few days afterwards, the chiefs came in, however, and signed a treaty
of peace.
10. Although Canada was conquered, and the war ended in that
quarter, peace was not fully concluded between Great Britain and
France till the year 1763. In the year 1762, Great Britain and
Spain were at war, and a force being about to be sent against Martinico, in the West Indies, eleven battalions, consisting of four thousand
men, under the command of General Monckton, were ordered for New
York.
11. The French struggled hard, this year, to retake Newfoundland, but without success. This was their last effort. Peace was
made between the contending nations in 1763, by which all the possessions of the French to the northward of the United Colonies
were ceded to Great Britain, to which country they still belong.
Louisiana was also ceded by the French to Spain about the same
time.
CHAPTER LXXII.
Tacation of the colonies
1. As early as the year 1651, Great Britain had begun to pass
laws to restrain and direct the colonial trade. Similar attempts were
made in 1660; again in 1672, 1676, 1691, and 1692. In the year
1696, a pamphlet was published- not indeed by the ministry, but by
some person of distinction -in which it was recommended to lay a
tax on one of the colonies.
2. This pamphlet was answered by two others, which denied the
power to tax colonies which were not represented in parliament, and
which had never consented to such taxation. Indeed, the colonies
had always felt aggrieved by the British restrictions upon their trade
and commerce; and Massachusetts and New York had shown their
dissatisfaction by public acts of their assemblies.
3. It is true that the British had incurred a heavy expense on
account of the colonies, but then the trade of the latter was of
immense value to them. Still they seemed determined to impose
say of the march. 8. What happened in 1760? 9. In 1761? 10. When was peace

taxes in some foIm. In 1764, it was distinctly stated in the English
papers that they were about to defray the expenses of quartering a
body of troops among our countrymen, by requiring a duty on sugar,
molasses, indigo, coffee, &amp;c.
4. The sugar act, as it was called, was passed the 5th of April;
and it was at the same time determined that ten thousand soldiers
should be kept in America. The British had a large standing army,
and they must be quartered somewhere; and why not, they doubtless
thought, keep a part of them in America, where there is of late such
a frequent demand for their services  
5. But the colonists complained loudly of both these measures,
especially as they had not given their assent to them. The Massachusetts agent, in England, had indeed partially assented to them,
but the colonists had immediately protested against the concession,
as admitting a principle which they had never intended to yield. It
was all to no purpose, however; the parliament were determined to
make the experiment of taxation without representation.
6. How much the British were influenced, at this time, by a fear
of the rising power of the colonies, that had shown themselves able
to overcome, almost single-handed, the whole host of French and
Indians from Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico, cannot now be
known. Certain it is, however, that they began to entertain hostile
feelings towards our country on this account.
7. On the other hand, the determination of the mother country to
pay no regard to the complaints of the colonies, respecting taxation
without representation, had laid the foundation of much ill-will, on the
part of the colonies, toward her; and much was said and written on
the subject by their ablest statesmen and writers, especially by James
Otis, of Boston, and Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia.
8. The sugar act led to a great deal of smuggling, and finally to
an almost entire extinction of the colonial trade with the French and
Spanish West Indies. The colonies, as if to retaliate, resolved not
to purchase clothing of the English, but to use, as much as possible,
their own manufactures.
9. This resolution was so generally adhered to, that the consumption of British merchandise was greatly diminished in the colonies,
especially in the large and populous towns. In Boston, alone, it was
lessened, in the year 1764, more than ten thousand pounds sterling.*
But this, instead of inducing the parent country to relax the severity
of their measures, only induced them to persevere in their oppression.

12131                     THE STAMP ACT.
CHAPTER LXXIII.
The Stamnp Act.
1. IN 1765, the British parliament passed what has always been
known by the name of the Stamp Act. According to this act, no
colonial instruments, in writing, such as deeds, bonds and notes, were
to be binding, or of any force whatever, unless they were executed
on stamped paper, for which a duty was to be paid to the crown of
Great Britain.
2. As the result of this act, a ream of stamped bail-bonds would
come to one hundred pounds sterling, or nearly five hundred dollars,
and a ream of stamped policies of insurance to one hundred and ninety
pounds; whereas, before this, the former cost only fifteen pounds,
and the latter, twenty. It was only a tax of some eight or ten cents
on each sheet, and was not, in itself, aside from the principle on
which it was based, very oppressive.
3. Though the act passed the House of Lords, in Great Britain,
unanimously, it met with opposition in the House of Commons.
Colonel Barre, in particular, spoke against it with great warmth
and eloquence. And when the question was put, whether or not
it should be passed, fifty members out of three hundred were
against it.
4. It is also worthy of note that while the act was thus in debate,
Dr. Franklin, who was then in London, and much respected for his
good sense, was sent for and consulted. He told them, plainly, the
Americans would never submit to it. After the act passed, he wrote

to a friend: " The sun of liberty is set. The Americans must now
light the torches of industry and economy."
5. But the opposition the stamp act had met with in England was
as nothing to the resistance it was destined to meet with in the
colonies.* A general burst of indignation pervaded the country,
and most of the legislative assemblies passed resolves, and some of
them protests, against it. Nowhere, however, was more spirit manifested on the subject than in Virginia.
6. The assembly of this colony having met soon after the news of
the stamp act arrived, a series of resolutions, strongly expressive of
disapprobation, was introduced, which occasioned a warm debate
and some very hard words. It was on this occasion that Patrick
Henry, then quite a young man, by a bold remark of his, gave
an impulse that was felt from one end of the continent to the other.
7. He had been asserting that the British king had acted the part
of a tyrant. Then, alluding to the fate of other tyrants, he observed,
"Caesar had his Brutus, Charles I. his Cromwell, and George III."
Here he paused; upon which the cry of "Treason!
treason!" being raised in the house, he only added, "may profitfrom
their example! If that be treason, make the most of it."
8. A' congress of the colonies having been recommended by
Massachusetts, one was accordingly convened in New York, in
October. It consisted of three members from each of the colonies
of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and South Carolina.
They remonstrated against the stamp act, and drew up a declaration
of their rights, declaring taxation and representation to be inseparable.
9. But the public disapprobation was expressed in another way.
The people had burnt, or reshipped, or hid the stamped paper already
in the colonies, so that, on the day in which the paper went into
operation, little, if any, could be found. They would not even
receive the Canadian gazettes, because they were on stamped paper.
Such a course was indeed equivalent to the suspension of nearly all
business, but it was resolutely-persevered in.

greater. These continued to be published, though on inferior paper.
They were, as with one voice, clamorous against the stamp act,
and severe in their denunciations of those who were friendly to it.
2. Societies in great numbers were formed, during this year,
of those who were determined to unite in resisting parliamentary
oppression.  They called themselves "Sons of Liberty."    They
were particularly numerous in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Towards the close of the year, these associations, in the
several colonies, became united by a kind of national compact.
3. Societies of quite another kind were also formed. Dr. Franklin had advised the people to "light the lamps of industry and
economny."   These associations, just now referred to, embraced
persons of all ages and of both sexes, who were more willing to do
without luxuries, and live by their own industry, than to depend on
Great Britain.
4. Instead of wearing imported cloth, the more wealthy people
were soon seen in dresses of their own manufacture; and for fear
there might not be wool enough for their purpose, the use of sheep
for food was discouraged. The most fashionable people could now
card, spin, and weave their own cloth, and deny themselves the use
of all foreign luxuries.
5. Nor were these resolutions and changes in modes of living
confined to cities and towns, and to the more wealthy.    Close
economy became the order of the day. Multitudes of artists and
manufacturers, in England, were left withlout employment, as the
consequence of the diminished sale of their productions in the colonies; and Great Britain everywhere began to feel the consequences
of her folly.
6. Meanwhile, mobs began to be got up in the colonies. In
August, two images, called effigies, were found hanging on the
branch of an old elm tree, near the southern limits of Boston. One
represented a stamp officer. There was a great jack-boot, also, out
of which rose a horned head, which seemed to gaze around. Multitudes collected from all parts to witness the strange sight.
7. This, however, was but the beginning of mobs and mob law.
About dark the same day, the effigies in Boston were taken down,
placed on a bier, and carried about the city in solemn procession.
The mob followed, shouting aloud, "Liberty and property, forever;
and no stamps!"
8. After passing through several of the principal streets, they
halted at the house of one Oliver, which they supposed to be intended
for a stamp office, and having demolished it, carried off the wood
through the streets, with a tremendous noise, to the dwelling of Mr.
Oliver; where, having gone through the ceremony of cutting off his
head, in effigy, they finished by breaking his windows.
9. They then marched up Fort Hill, still following the two
figures, jack-boots, horns and all. Here they kindled a bonfire with

them -returned to Oliver's house with clubs and staves, and destroyed his gardens, fences and out-houses. Oliver fled. They then
broke open his doors and destroyed much of his furniture. The next
day, Mr. Oliver gave notice that he would not serve as a stamp
officer; upon which the farce ended.
10. These riotous acts, or those which were similar, were repeated
in Boston and elsewhere throughout New England, and even in
New York, Maryland, and the Carolinas. At Newport and New
York, the effigies of various persons, who were disliked, were
dragged about, hung, burned, &amp;c.; and, in a few instances, houses
were plundered.
CHAPTER LXXV.
Repeal of the Stamp Act.
1. THE king and parliament of Great Britain finally saw their
error, but they were too proud to retrace their steps by repealing
the offensive law. However, something must be done to quiet the
colonies; and this became, at the opening of the parliament in 1766,
a leading object of inquiry.
2. Dr. Franklin was again consulted on the subject. He did not
assume anr air of triumph and say, "I told you all this would happen."  He knew, too well, the weakness and folly of human nature,
even in members of parliament. He only repeated What he had

before said, "That, though the Americans were a reasonable people,
they would never submit to taxation of any kind without representation, unless compelled to do so by mere force of arms."
3. Fortunately for Great Britain, as well as America, there had
been, about this time, a change in the administration, and the repeal
of the stamp act had become, at length, a subject of earnest and deep
consideration. And though there was great and even obstinate opposition to its repeal, the measure was at length carried.
4. The repeal of the act was hailed with universal joy. The American merchants in London were among the first to testify their gratitude. The ships lying in the river Thames displayed their colors.
The houses of the city were lighted up, cannon fired, bonfires kindled,
and messengers sent to spread the news, as fast as possible, in England and America.MORE TAXATION.                       139
principle against which the colonists had been all along contending.
7. Well had it been, no doubt, for the mother country, had she
stopped here; and though the right to tax America had been asserted,
refrained from any other offensive or oppressive acts. But Providence
had not designed - so it would seem - that the colonies should
always remain the subjects of a monarch three thousand miles distant;
%nd the hour of separation was rapidly approaching.
CHAPTER LXXVI.
More taxation.
George III.-1766.
1. ON the 29th of June, 1767, the king signed another act, which
involved the principle of taxation without representation, and as
applied, in its worst features. It required a duty, to be paid by the
colonists, on all paper, glass, painters' colors, and tea, which were
imported into the country.
2. The people of America did not hesitate to pronounce this act
as unjust as the sugar and stamp act had been. It was not that they
were too poor to pay a small tax on such articles as these, but if the
crown could tax them without their consent in one way, it could in
another; and where was the matter to end!
3. The British, it is true, reasoned otherwise. Their finances,
they said, were exhausted by a war for the support of the colonies,
and which had cost them nearly four hundred millions of dollars. It
was, therefore, not only right that the Americans should contribute
to pay its expenses, but extremely ungrateful for them to refuse.
They had taxed themselves severely on cider, ale, beer, porter, tea,

3. Soon after Columbus had revealed his great discovery to Europe,
many adventurers came hither, chiefly in search of gold, siNler and
precious stones, which were very abundant in some parts of the country. Many of these adventurers had commissions from the king of
Spain, and several of them were supplied by him with ships, money
and soldiers, the purpose of which was to conquer and take possession
of differefit parts of America for Spain.
4. Thus Mexico was conquered by the bloody Cortez; Peru by
the cruel and remorseless Pizarro; and Chili by Almagro. Other
portions were seized by other leaders, until the southern part of North
America, two thirds of South America, and the finest of the West
India islands, were within the grasp of the king of Spain.
5. The Portuguese seized upon Brazil; the French upon Canada,
the mouth of the Mississippi, and some of the West Indies; and
England upon a portion of the Atlantic coast of North America.
Other European powers picked here and there in the scramble,
seizing upon such parts and pieces as they could get.
6. Thus America became the spoil of European kings, who seized
upon the lands, and conquered or destroyed the native inhabitants,
according to their interest or pleasure.  The whole proceeding took
place in a dark age, arid under one great and melancholy error, which
was this -that uncivilized people are heathen, and consequently enemies of God, and whom it is, therefore, right to subdue, enslave, or
kill, as may be deemed convenient by Christian men.
7. Thus it happened that the wars against the natives in America
were generally carried on under the sanction of the Christian religion;
the Indians were massacred by millions, in the name of Jesus Christ;
whole empires were devastated by those who went forth preaching
and praying and performing all the rites and ceremonies of the
church!
8. The chief elements of the history of America consist in six
general topics, which are as follows: 1st, its Discovery; 2d, its Participation between different European Powers; 3d, the Wars with
the Indians; 4th, the Wars among the European Powers, which involved the American colonies; 5th, the Struggles of the Colonies for
Independence; and, 6th, the General Progress of Wealth and Civilization.
9. In the following pages we shall endeavor to give a view of
these topics, devoting the largest space to the United States, which
present not only the most interesting, but by far the most instructivepassages of American history.

sugar, coffee, molasses, &amp;c, and why could not the colonies pay
something also?
4. And as to taxation without representation, the British said that
the colonies had taxed themselves, most heavily, and without being
represented in parliament. They were not represented when Massachusetts paid two millions of dollars for the support of one French
war, and also furnished twenty thousand to thirty thousand troops;
why did they not complain then  But this reasoning did not satisfy
the colonists.
5. But the tax on paper, glass, tea, &amp;c., was not alone. A law
was passed which obliged the several American legislatures to provide quarters for the British troops, and furnish them with fuel, lodging, candles, and other necessaries, at the expense of the colonies.
This act was little less odious than the former.
6. New York, it is true, so far yielded as to make partial provision
for the troops about to be quartered there. The assembly, at the
request of the governor, voted to furnish barracks, fire-wood, candles
and beds; but not salt, vinegar, cider and beer, as the law demanded.
They, however, finally furnished the whole.
7. Still more than all this,- an act passed the parliament, establishing a custom-house and board of commissioners in America. The
duties were to commence November 20; and early in that month three
of the commissioners arrived at Boston. The colonists, believing this
board was created to enforce payment of the new duties, were more
inflamed than ever.
8. Besides, the duties collected were to be applied in paying the
salaries of governors, judges and other officers; and it was easy to
see that if they were paid in this way, rather than by the general
assembly, they would not be so likely to regard the interest of the
people whom they served; and would be more apt to be the mere
tools of the king and parliament.
9. The consequences were, resolves, petitions, and remonstrances
from all parts of the country. In 1768, the legislature of Massachusetts voted a humble petition to the king on the subject. This was
followed by a circular letter to the representatives and burgesses of
the other colonies, requesting them to unite in some suitable measures
for obtaining a redress of their grievances.
10. This circular and the petition to the king, by Massachusetts,
gave great offence to the British administration, and they demanded
of the colonies that they should retrace the steps they had taken,
and crush in the bud the rising propensity among them to act in
concert. To this end, they, in their turn, sent a circular to the colonies. But all to no purpose.

which they specified; nor to purchase British articles of the same
kind from other colonies or nations which had procured them from
Britain.
12. But there was trouble springing up of another kind. The
laws of trade had been hitherto greatly eluded, but the board of commissioners now determined they should be executed. A sloop, laden
with wine, from Madeira, came into port. During the night, all the
wine, except a few pipes, was unladen and put into stores. The
custom-house officers seized the vessel and put her under a guard.
13. This last act roused the indignation of the Bostonians more
than ever. A mob collected and proceeded to the houses of the collector and controller of customs, broke the windows, dragged tihe collector's boat through the streets, and finally burnt it on the common;
and some of the custom-house officers narrowly escaped with their
lives.
CHAPTER LXXVII.
British troops in Boston.
1. THE existing excitement was much heightened by the arrival in
the harbor, a few days afterward, of two regiments of British troops,
sent to assist the governor and the other civil magistrates of Boston in
preserving peace, and to aid the custom-house officers in performing

their duty. What added still more to the public indignation was the
fact that the troops mrarched through the city, to the common, with
muskets charged and with fixed bayonets.
2. The selectmen of the town at first refused to give the soldiers
any quarters, though they finally consented to admit one regiment of
them into Faneuil Hall. The next day, as if in direct defiance of
the public feeling, the governor opened the state-house to them, and
they not only occupied it, but stationed a guard with two field-pieces
in front of it.
3. This was new to the Bostonians. It was quite as much as they
could bear, to have a royal governor and foreign collectors of customs
among them; but to have the king's soldiers and cannon about the
state-house, and fill the streets, even on Sunday, with the noise of
drums and fifes, was more than their independent spirits could calmly
endure.
4. It was not, however, till the beginning of the year 1769, that
an universal indignation was roused throughout the colonies. The
feeling of opposition had hitherto been somewhat local, but the spirit
of resistance had now extended to every part of the country.
5. The British parliament, in February, 1769, had requested the
king to give orders to the governor of Massachusetts, to take notice
of such persons, in his province, as might be guilty of treason, and
have them sent to England to be tried. These orders were, doubtless, to have been extended afterward to the governors of the other
colonies.
6. No measure could have been adopted, by the parent country,
more likely to alienate the feelings of her American subjects than this.
To be liable to be torn from their own country to be tried by a jury of
strangers, was as repugnant to their feelings as it was to the spirit of
the British constitution.
7. The house of burgesses of Virginia, and the general assembly
of North Carolina, having met a few days after the arrival of this
odious intelligence, passed a series of resolutions, which greatly
offended their governors, - who, like the governor of Massachusetts,
were royal favorites, -and they forthwith broke up their deliberations. But it was too late to gag the people, and especially the representatives of the people in general assembly.
8. Affairs proceeded no better in Massachusetts. When their
legislature met, in May, they refused to transact business as long as
the state-house was surrounded by an armed force. As the governor
was unwilling to remove the troops, they adjourned to Cambridge,
whlere, after passing some resolutionis which were offensive to the
governor, they were dismissed by him, and sent home, as their
southern brethren had been.

142~ THE BOSTON MASSACRE.
C-IAPTER LXXVIII.
The Boston Massacre.
1. DURING t,he session of the British parliament, in the spring of
1770, an act was passed for repealing all the duties which caused so
much complaint, except that on tea. This was continued, to show
that they had not yielded the right to imnpose taxes, if they chose to
do so. As might have been expected, however, the colonists were
still dissatisfied.
2. The British troops remained in Boston, and seemed determined
to remain there, notwithstanding the known disgust of the citizens at
the idea of having a foreign force stationed among them. There was,
it is true, for some time, no open quarrel, but the citizens and soldiers
were continually insulting each other.
3. Things could not remain thus, always. On the 2d of March,
1770, as a soldier was going by the shop of a rope-maker, he was
attacked and severely beaten. He ran off, but soon returned with a
number of his comrades, and attacked and beat some of the ropemakers.
4. The people were now more angry than ever. Between seven
and eight o'clock in the evening of March 5, a mob collected, armed
with clubs, and proceeded towards King street, now State street, crying, " Let us drive out these rascals -they have no business here -
drive them out! Drive out the rascals!"  Meanwhile, there was a
cry that the town had been set on fire.
5. The bells rang, and the crowd became greater still, and more
noisy. They rushed furiously to the custom-house, and seeing an
English sentinel there, shouted, "Kill him! kill him! "-at the same
time attacking him with pieces of ice and whatever they could find.
The sentinel called for the rest of the guard, and a few of them came
forward.
6. The guard marched out with their guns loaded. They met a
great crowd of people, led on by an immense giant of a negro, named
Attucks. They brandished their clubs and pelted the soldiers with
snow-balls, abusing them with harsh words, shouting in their faces,
and even challenging therm to fire. They even rushed upon the very
points of their bayonets.
7. The soldiers stood a while like statues, the bells ringing and the
mob pressing upon them. At last, Attucks, with twelve of his men,
began to strike upon their muskets with clubs, and to cry out to the
mob, "Don't be afraid - they dare not fire- the miserable cowards
- kill the rascals - crush themn under foot!"
8. Attucks now lifted his arm against the captain of the guard, and
seized hold of a bayonet. " They dare not fire!" shouted the mob
again. At this instant the firing began. Attucks dropped dead,

immediately. The soldiers fired twice more, and two more were
killed and others wounded. The mob dispersed, but soon returned
to carry off the bodies.
9. The whole town was now in an uproar. Thousands of men,
women and children, rushed through the streets. The sound of
drurris, and cries of "To arms! To arms!" were heard from all
quarters. The soldiers who had fired on the people were arrested,
and the governor at last persuaded the mob to disperse and go quietly
to their homes.
10 The next morning, the troops in the city were ordered off to
Castle William, one of the city fortifications. On the 8th of March,
the three slain citizens were buried. The shops were all closed
during the ceremony, and the bells in Boston and the adjoining towns
were all the while tolling. An immense procession followed to the
church-yard.
11. The soldiers were, soon afterwards, tried. Two of them were
condemned and imprisoned, and six of them were acquitted. John
Adams and Josiah Quincy, eminent lawyers, pleaded their cause.
The mob would have torn them in pieces if they could have had their
own way, for mobs are seldom just or reasonable.
CHAPTER LXXIX.
Burning of the Gaspee.
1. FOR a year or two, things went onI better than before, though
not by any means quietly. The merchants began again to buy
English goods, except tea, which they would have nothing to do
with. Associations were even formed in many parts of the country,
the parties pledging themselves not to use it.
2. The revenue officers continued to be despised, and, as much as
possible, treated with contempt. In the year 1771, one of them, in
Boston, had undertaken to seize a vessel for some violation of the
law, when he was taken by the mob, stripped naked, carted through
the city, and tarred and feathered.
3. There was, the same year, an insurrection in North Carolina.
A body of the inhabitants, to the number of fifteen hundred, under
the name of regulators, rose against law, order and government, and
against all lawyers and officers of government. Governor Tryon
marched against them, killed three hundred, and took some prisoners
A number of them were tried for high treason and executed.
4. But one of the most startling events of this period took place
at Rhode Island, in the year 1772. The Gaspee, a British armed
schooner, had been lying, for some time, at Providence, to sustain
townr?  What of the governor! 10. What was done the next day?     Describe the

the laws respecting trade. The Rhode Island people, many of them,
hated her, and only waited for a favorable opportunity for giving vent
to their indignatioIn.
5. Such an opportunity soon occurred. The Gaspee was accustomed to require the Providence vessels to take down their colors when
they came into port, and to fire on them and chase them into port, if
they refused. One day, as a packet was coming in with passengelrs,
she refused to lower her colors; upon which the Gaspee gave chase
to her, and in the chase ran aground.
6. This was just what the packet wanted, and she had manceuvred
for this purpose. On arriving at the city, a plan was laid to destroy
the schooner. A volunteer company of soldiers was soon enlisted,
under Captain Wipple, and several boats, with armed men, prepared
for the service.
7. About two o'clock, the next morning, the party found means to
get on board the Gaspee. After sending the lieutenant, with his more
valuable effects, together with the crew, on shore, they burnt the
schooner with all her stores. The lieutenant, in a conflict, while they
were boarding the Gaspee, was wounded, but no one was otherwise
injured.
8. Great pains were taken by the officers of the British government
to discover and punish these offenders against the royal authority.
Among other measures, a reward of five hundred pounds sterling was
offered. Commissioners were also appointed to hear and try the cause.
No discovery, however, was made.
9. At a town meeting in Boston, this year, a committee was appointed to lay before the several towns inr the provinces, as well as
before the world, the views of the people respecting their own rights
in relation to the parent country. Virginia came into the measure in
the year 1773, and recommended the plan to the other colonies.
Committees of correspondence were appointed, which kept up an
interchange of opinions between the colonies, and laid the basis of
their final union.
CHAPTER LXXX.
The tea thrown overboard.
1. A BILL was passed by the British parliamnent, in 1773, allowing
the East India Company to export their teas to America without the
duties paid in England. As this would make tea actually cheaper in
America than in Great Britain, it was thought that the colonies would
willingly pay the small duty thus demanded of them, it being only
thiree pence a pound.

2. Large ships were accordingly loaded with tea, and sent out to
America. When they arrived, however, not a man could be found to
receive the tea, or have anything to do with it. A few chests, which
some individual had brought to Philadelphia, were let down very qui
etly into the sea by a band of persons who went slily on board for that
purpose.
3. The East India Company, confident of finding a market for their
tea, reduced, as it now was, in its price, freighted several ships with it
to the colonies, and appointed agents for its disposal. Some cargoes
were sent to New York, some to Philadelphia, some to Charleston,
S. C., and three to Boston.
4. The inhabitants of New York and Philadelphia sent the tea,
which came to them, back to London. The people of Charleston
unloaded theirs and stored it in damp cellars, where it was soon
spoiled.  The Bostonians tried to send theirs back to London,
but could not succeed. They would not, however, suffer it to be
landed.
5. As a last resort, a town-meeting was summoned, and it was
agreed to call on the governor and make a formal request to him that
the ships might be sent off. But the governor paid no attention to the
request. This produced a great uproar, and a man in the gallery,
dressed like an Indian, shouted the cry of War; upon which the meeting was dissolved instantly.
6. The multitude then rushed towards the wharf where the tea
vessels lay. Here were seventeen sea captains, carpenters, &amp;c.,
dressed and painted like Indians. It was now night, and in the darkness they went on board the three vessels, and in less than two hours
three hundred and forty chests were staved and emptied into the
America. 3. What of the East India Company 1 4. What was done with the teai by

sea. When this was done, the crowd dispersed quietly to their
hiomes.
7. An account of these disturbances reached England early in
1774, but it only incensed the government so much the more against
the colonies, and made them so much the more resolute in the deterrnination to punish them for their insolence. Boston was the first to
feel their vengeance; and, in order to destroy the trade of that town,
they forbade the landing of any goods in it; thus virtually placing it
in a state of blockade.
8. This last act of parliament was called the port bill. It took
effect June 1st. Its passage was a most unpropitious event. Not
only in Boston, but throughout the country, there was a general
burst of indignation. Town meetings were held and fasts appointed;
and a "league and covenant," as it was called, not to trade any more
with England, was signed by immense numbers of the citizens.
9. General Gage, who had, in the spring of the year, been appointed governor of Massachusetts, issued his proclamation against
the league, declaring it to be treasonable; but the Bostonians only
said, in reply, that his proclamation was treason, and that all who
refused to sign the league were enemies to their country.
CHAPTER LXXXI.
The first Congress.
1. WHEN the legislature of Massachusetts met at Salem, in June
of this year, a meeting of committees, or delegates, from the several
colonies was proposed, and delegates, on the part of Massachusetts,
were selected. The other colonies fell in with the measure, and it
was gradually adopted, and delegates appointed, from New Hampshire
to Georgia.
2. This meeting of delegates, or First General Congress of the,olonies, was opened September 4, 1774, at Philadelphia. Committees, or delegates, were present from eleven of the colonies. Those
from North Carolina did not arrive till the 14th. They chose Peyton
Randolph president, and Charles Thompson secretary.   They also
determined that, in their proceedings, each colony should be entitled
to one vote only.
3. The proceedings of this congress were distinguished for great
boldness, decision and determination. A declaration of rights was
soon agreed on. It was also resolved that no goods should be carried
to Great Britain, nor any received from that country. They further

agreed to send a petition to the king, an address to the British people,
and a memorial to the inhabitants of Canada.
4. The congress was in session eight weeks.     Before it was
dissolved, another congress was proposed to be held at the same
place on the 10th of the following May, " unless a redress of their
grievances should be previously obtained;" to which meeting, or
congress, all the colonies were advised to appoint delegates as soon as
possible.
5. Concerning the proceedings of the first congress of the united
colonies, which have been alluded to as somewhat remarkable, we
have the testimony of Mr. Pitt himself, the British minister, who
had read their mnemorial, address and petition, and who would not be
apt to speak too highly of their character. It is as follows:
6. "I must declare and avow that in all my reading and studyand it has been my favorite study - I have read Thucydides and have
studied and admired the master states of the world -that for solidity
of reasoning, force of sagacity, and wisdom of conclusion, under such
complication of circumstances, no nation or body of men can stand in
preference to the general congress at Philadelphia."
CHAPTER LXXXII.
The dawn of Liberty.
1. WHILE the king's troops remained in Boston, it was curious to
watch the influence of their presence on the young. The boys of the
city soon caught the spirit of opposition which burned in the bosoms
of their fathers, as will appear in the following anecdote.
2. The boys of Boston were, in the winter, in the habit of building, for amusement, little hills of snow, and sliding them into the
pond on the common. The English soldiers, merely to provoke
them, beat down these snow hills. The boys rebuilt them. On
returning to them, after school, however, they found them beaten
down again.
3. Several of the boys now waited upon the British captain and
informed him of the conduct of his soldiers. But the captain only
made light of it; which the soldiers perceiving, only became more
troublesome to the boys than they were before.
4. At last they called a meeting of the largest boys, and sent
them to General Gage, the commander-in-chief. He asked why so
many children had called upon him.   "We come, sir," said the
tallest boy, "to demand satisfaction."  "What," said the general,

148DISCOVERIES OF TIHE NORTHIMEN.               15
CHAPTER V.
Discovery of America by the Northmen.
1. BEFORE we proceed to speak of Columbus, we must say a few,
words respecting the accounts of the discovery of America, previous
to his time. The Welsh have a tradition, of some celebrity, according to which, a chieftain of Wales, named Madoc, made several distant voyages to the west, about the year 1170.
2. In one of those expeditions, they say that he discovered "a
fair and large country;" and, returning to Wales, took with him a
number of his friends and relatives, and set forth to settle there.
From this period there was never anything heard of them. It has
been thought that the "fair and large country" was America, and
that these emigrants went thither. But there is no good reason to
believe this tradition.
3. The discovery of America by the Northmen, at an earlier
period, rests on a surer foundation. The inhabitants of Norway and
Denmark were by far the most adventurous seamen of Europe during
the middle ages. As early as the year 860, they had discovered
Iceland, and it was colonized by the Norwegians in 874.
4. Greenland was discovered not long after, and was settled by
two colonies, one from Denmark and one from Norway. Hence the
intercourse between this place and the home country became common. According to well authenticated accounts, in the year 1002,
Leif, a Norwegian, with a numnber of men, set sail from Greenland
and proceeded to the south-west.

"have your fathers been teaching you rebellion, and sent you to
exhibit it here?"
5. "Nobody sent us, sir," answered the boy, while his cheek
reddened and his eye flashed. " We have never injured or insulted
your troops; but they have trodden down our snow hills, and broken
the ice on our skating ground. We complained, and they called us
young rebels, and told us to help ourselves if we could. We told the
captain of this, and he laughed at us. Yesterday our works were
destroyed the third time, and we will bear it no longer."
6. General Gage looked at them a moment, in silent admiration,
and then said to an officer at his side, "The very children here
draw in a love of liberty with the air they breathe. You mnay go,
niy brave boys; and be assured if my troops trouble you again they
shall be punished."
CHAPTER LXXXIII.
Preparation for war.
1. THE symptoms of rebellion became so apparent in the progress of this year, 1774, that Governor Gage began to fortify Boston
neck, as the narrow portion of land which unites Boston with Roxbury and the back country was then called. This being done, he
sent out troops, and seized upon the powder magazine at Charlestown.
2. These measures produced much excitement in Boston; to add
to which, some evil-minded person raised a report that the British
vessels in the harbor had begun to fire upon the town. Such an
uproar existed, in and about Boston, that, in a few hours, from twenty
thousand to thirty thousand men were on their march to the city.
Finding their mistake, however, they went home again.
3. But the public excitement was not confined to the immediate
neighborhood of Boston.  In Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the
colonists seized upon the fort, though garrisoned with British troops,
and carried off every gun and every pound of powder. The people
of Newport, Rhode Island, also took possession of forty pieces of
cannon in the same way.
4. As Governor Gage had been unfriendly to the measures of the
colonial assembly, it was determined that the legislature should meet
in Concord. The meeting was resolved into a provincial congress,
and John Hancock was chosen its president. Here measures were
taken for arming the whole province; twelve thousand men were
X be raised, and to hold themselves ready to march at a moment's
varning.
LXXXIII. - 1. What did Governor Gage now do? 2. What excitement was raised
in Boston? 3. What can you say of the people in different places? 4. What was nowBATTLE OF LEXINGTON.
5. A request was also forwarded by this assembly to Connecticut,
New Hampshire and Rhode Island, to urge their cooperation in the
measures of the Massachusetts congress, and to increase the army
of " minute men" to twenty thousand.    A  committee was also
appointed to correspond with the inhabitants of Canada.
6. Another thing was done by the congress at Concord. A
circular letter was addressed to the ministers of the gospel in the
province, requesting their assistance in avoiding that "dreadful
slavery," as they called it, with which the country was threatened.
What effect this letter had, does not appear; but it is well known
that both the ministers and lawyers of the states were, almost to a
man, among the fiiends of liberty.
7. A provincial congress, which was held in Maryland, sustained,
by its resolutions and measures, both the doings of the general congress at Philadelphia and those of the provincial congress at Concord.
The same spirit was manifested by the resolutions and acts of some
of the other provinces, especially South Carolina.
8. It was at this juncture that Dr. Franklin was removed from
the office of postmaster general of the British colonies of North
America. The honest, but decided course he had taken, both while
residing in England and while at home in Philadelphia, had offended
the British government, and they were determined that he should
feel the effects of their displeasure.
CHAPTER LXXXIV.
Battle of Lexiqzgton.
1. LITTLE attention was paid by the British government to what
was going on in Boston and elsewhere. They thought the colonists
wrong-headed and rebellious, and that they must be forced into
obedience. Mr. Pitt, indeed, was wiser; but his opinion was disregarded. They passed an act, in February, 1775, declaring the
Massachusetts people to be rebels; and another to raise more troops
and seamen.
2. Meanwhile, the colonies were preparing for war.   Amongc
other munitions, they had a great amount of military stores in
Boston, and wished to remove them to the country. To deceive
the British guards, they carried out cannon and ball in carts, covered
with manure; powder in market-baskets; and cartridges in candleboxes.

too. One day he sent his soldiers for some cannon he had heard of
at Salem. As they were returning, the people had assembled and
taken up a drawbridge, and would not let the soldiers pass; and had
it not been for the interposition of Mr. Bernard, a clergyman, a battle
would probably have ensued.
Battle of Lexington.
4. Late in the evening of April 18, Governor Gage sent out eight
hundred grenadiers and light infantry to destroy some military stores
at Lexington and Concord. But, in spite of the lateness of the hour
and the secrecy of his movements, he was discovered, and a part of
the militia were on the green near the meeting-house in Lexington,
by two o'clock in the morning, ready to defend the stores, if necessary.
5. At five o'clock, on the morning of the 19th, the British troops,
with Major Pitcairn at their head, came marching into Lexington.
"Disperse, you rebels!" said Major P., with an oath, to the militia.
"Throw   down your arms and disperse!"      The order was not
obeyed. He then rode towards them, discharged his pistol, brandished his sword, and ordered his men to fire. They fired, and three
or four persons fell dead.
6. The militia, upon this, began to disperse; but the firing did
not cease. The British shouted and fired, while the Americans
were retreating; and the latter stopped occasionally to return the fire.
Several of the Americans were slain in their retreat, and several
others wounded. The whole number of the Americans who were
killed was eight.
7. The British now proceeded to Concord. There they destroyed
two large cannon, threw about five hundred pounds of ball into

wells, and staved sixty barrels of flour. The Concord militia had,
at first, assembled with hostile intentions; but finding the British too
strong for them, they had retired. They were soon reinforced, however, by Major Buttrick, and ordered on to the attack. The British
fired on them as they advanced, and killed two men.
8. A severe battle ensued, in which the British were forced to
Yetreat with some loss. They now began to make the best of their
way back to Boston, for the people were pouring in from all parts of
the country towards Lexington and Concord. There were-farmers
and mechanics, fathers and sons, side by side.
9. They came, it is true, with their own weapons -many of them
such as they had been accustomed to shoot squirrels with, and rather
rusty, but they were trained to the use of them. These they used
as well as they could, from behind barns, houses, sheds, stone walls
and trees; and their shot did execution.
10. When the British reached Lexington they met a reinforcement of nine hundred men from Boston. With this fresh aid, they
were able to check the Americans for a short time, but not long.
The road everywhere was beset by the patriots, and the British were
falling, here and there, as they proceeded back to Charlestown, which
they reached about sunset.
11. The results of this enterprise, though no pitched battle had
been fought, were very distressing to both parties, but especially to
the British. They had sixty-five killed, one hundred and eighty
wounded, and twenty-eight made prisoners. During the whole day,
the Americans had fifty killed, thirty-four wounded, and some four or
five taken prisoners.
12. The battle of Lexington was the signal of war. The forts,
magazines and arsenals, throughout the country, were instantly secured
by the colonists, that they might be ready for use; should they become
necessary. Twelve years of peace had not made them forget all the
lessons they had learned in the art of war. Regular forces were soon
raised, and money furnished for their support.
13. An army of twenty thousand men was collected in the neighborhood of Boston in a very short time. One considerable body of
them came from Connecticut, under Col. Putnam, an experienced
and valuable officer. These forces encamped around Boston in a
semicircle, as if to shut up the town on every side but the water.

1531b4     CAPTURE OF TICONDEROGA AND CROWN POINT.
CHAPTER LXXXV.
uapture of Ticonderoga and Crown Point.
1. No sooner was, it seen that a war with Great Britain was
inevitable, than the people of Connecticut set on foot a plan for the
capture of Crown Point and Ticonderoga, on the northern frontier.
The necessity of such a measure was so obvious that there was little
difficulty in raising both men and money; and this, too, with almost
absolute secrecy.
2. Colonel Ethan Allen, a brave man, who had emigrated from
Connecticut to the Green Mountains, a few years before, and was,
of course, well known there, was appointed as the conductor of the
enterprise. He was also expected to increase his forces by enlistments among the mountaineers. As soon as forty men were raised
in Connecticut, they were sent off to Colonel Allen.
3. They met him at Castleton, where he had already collected
two hundred and thirty men. Here they were unexpectedly joined
by Benedict Arnold, who, some time afterward, made such a strange
figure in American history. He had collected a company of volunteers in New Haven, and taken them on to Boston, where he had
been commissioned to raise four hundred men in Vermont, or elsewhere, and proceed against Ticonderoga.
4. Without waiting to raise more troops, they proceeded, with
their little band of two hundred and seventy, to Ticonderoga; Allen
being first in command and Arnold second. They reached Lake
Champlain, opposite Ticonderoga, May 9. They found some difficulty in obtaining boats. At length they procured enough of these to
carry eighty-three men, who landed near the garrison, just at dawn
of day, undiscovered.
5. After a short contention who should go in first, the two
colonels agreed to enter at the same time, abreast of each other. A
sentinel snapped his gun at them as they entered, and then retreated
to alarm his sleeping comrades. The American troops having followed their officers, they formed themselves into a hollow square and
gave three huzzas.
6. The garrison being now roused, a slight skirmish took place.
The British commander was required to surrender the fbrt. "By
what authority?" he asked.   " I demand it," said Allen, "in the
name of the Great Jehovah, and the Continental Congress." The
garrison was immediately given up, and with it forty-nine prisoners
and many valuable stores and cannon.
7. The fort at Crown Point was taken without difficulty; it

being garrisoned by only thirteen men. A sloop of war and several
pieces of cannon were also seized at the same time, together with
a schooner fitted out for service on the lake. All this was accom
plished, too, without the loss of a single man.
CHAPTER LXXXVI.
Vermont and Ethan Allen.
1. COLONEL ALLEN, though a brave man, was not always exemplary in his language. Like many more brave men, not only of the
American army, but of almost all armies, he had great defects of
character. His statement to the British officer savored strongly both
of profanity and untruth.
2. He had emigrated to Vermont, or the Green Mountains, as it
was then called, while quite young. This part of New England
did not begin to be settled till 1731, and, even for a long time after,
was considered as a part of New Hampshire. A contest arose at
length about it between New Hampshire and New York, which was
adjusted by the king, in a way which greatly displeased the settlers.
3. The consequence was that a quarrel arose between Vermont
and New York, or, more properly, between Vermont and the crown,
in which the Green Mountain boys, headed by Colonel Allen, resisted
the officers of justice, as well as the New York militia who were
called out to sustain them.
4. At the period of the capture of Ticonderoga, and even somewhat
later, Vermont had not so much as a territorial form of government.
In 1777, however, a convention of delegates met at Westminster, and
declared themselves an independent state, by the name of New Con
necticut, though it was afterwards changed to Vermont. They remained independent till some time after the end of the revolutionary
war.
5. Allen was employed for a time, after the capture of Ticonderoga, in Canada, in trying to persuade the people of that province
to join the colonies. Failing in this, he formed a plan, in the fall of
1775, in concert with Colonel Brown, to take Montreal, but was
himself taken prisoner, put in irons, and sent to England.
6. On the passage, both he and his companions experienced the
most cruel treatment. They were all, to the number of thirty-four,
handcuffed and crowded into a small place in the vessel, not more
than twenty-two feet long and twenty wide. After an imprisonment
of six months, in England and Halifax, he was sent to a prison-ship
in New York. He remained a prisoner at New York about a year
and a half.

7. Allen was a man of humane and tender feelings. While being
carried from Halifax to New York, a plan was laid to kill the captain, but when it was proposed to Allen, he refused to join in it. In
another instance, the British, knowing him to be a brave man,
attempted to bribe him to unite Vermont, an independent colony, with
Canada. But money could not buy him.
8. And yet it must be confessed that he was an open unbeliever in
Christianity. He not only wrote the first formal attack on the
Christian religion which was ever written in America, but he
adopted the notion that the soul of man, after death, would live again
in beasts, birds, fishes, &amp;c.; with many other notions still more singular.
9. It is said that though his wife was a pious woman, and taught
her children the truths of Christianity, one daughter inclined to the
same strange opinions with her father. When about to die, she sent
word to her father that she wished to converse withl him. The
father accordingly came to her bedside.
10. "I am about to die," said she; "shall I believe in the principles you have taught me, or shall I believe in what my mother
has taught me?"   The father became agitated, his chin quivered,
his whole frame shook, and, after waiting a few moments, he replied,
"Believe what your mother has taught you."  Allen died suddenly,
in 1789.
CHAPTER LXXXVII.
Battle of Bunker's Hill.
1. WE have seen that soon after the battle of Lexingrton and
Concord, Boston was, as it were, invested with American troops.
Their number, at one time, is said to have been about thirty thousand.
Their principal head-quarters were at Cambridge and Roxbury.
Colonel Putnam commanded at the former place, and General Thomas
at the latter.
2. Some time in May, Howe, Clinton and Burgoyne, three British
generals, arrived in Boston, with a reinforcement of British troops.
Governor Gage now offered a pardon to all the rebels, as he still
called them, except John Hancock and Samuel Adams, if they would
lay down their arms and be peaceable subjects. But as no attention
was paid to the offer, he prepared, more than ever, for war.

almost every day. The Americans concluded at length to fortify
Dorchester neck, now South Boston, and occupy Bunker's Hill, in
Charlestown. In order to effect the latter purpose, Colonel Prescott
was sent, on the 16th of June, to Charlestown, with one thousand
men. He left Cambridge with his troops about nine o'clock in the
evening.
4. His movements were so silent that the British did not discover
him. He, however, mistook Breed's Hill for Bunker's Hill, and,
with his troops, ascended and began to fortify it. At daybreak, on
the morning of the 17th, they had thrown up an embankment, or
redoubt, about eight rods square and four feet high, on a spot which
overlooked, and, as it were, commanded nearly the whole of Boston.
5. As soon as day dawned, the British saw what was going on,
and began to fire on them, both from their batteries in the town and
from their vessels. They also established and put in operation a formidable battery on Copp's Hill, on the northern part of the town,
which threw in among them whole showers of bomb-shells.
6. But all their ships and batteries combined could not batter down
the works of the Americans. They even worked all the forenoon in
the midst of the shot and the bomb-shells, and, by noon, had completed a breastwork from the redoubt to the bottom of the hill toward
Mystic river;- and, strange to relate, had lost, all this while, but
a single man!
7. Finding he could not dislodge the Americans in this way,
Governor Gage, about noon, sent over some of his best troops, under
Generals Howe and Pigot, to drive them from the hill. Having
landed, they waited for a reinforcement, to mature their plan: for
of Colonel Prescott! 4. What did he do? How large was the redoubt? 5. What was

they were not wholly without fears that the Americans might be
a little too strong for them. At length, they had collected together
about three thousand men.
8. The Americans, in the mean time, were also reinforced by a
body of troops, and by Generals Warren, Pomeroy, and Putnam.
The latter, who had just been made a brigadier-general, was commander-in-chief for the day. \ The Americans now amounted to about
fifteen hundred, though most of them were only armed with muskets
without bayonets.
9. At three o'clock, in the afternoon, the British began to ascend
the hill. The Charlestown militia opposed them at first, but soon
retreated. The British now set fire to Charlestown, containing from
four hundred to five hundred wooden buildings. As the wind was
high, the fire raged terribly; and the sight, though dreadful, was
sublime.
10. The British went slowly up the hill. It was a perilous hour.
Thousands of people, on the tops of the steeples and houses in Boston,
as well as on the hills round about, waited, in breathless silence, to
know the result. A battle there must be, as every one foresaw;
probably a bloody one; and the fate of the country depended, perhaps, on its issue.
11. But the British were now near the redoubt, and the Americans only withheld their fire in compliance with the orders of General
Putnam. "Do not fire a gun," said he, "till you can see the white
of their eyes." But even the strict letter of this command did not
require long delay. Such a tremendous volley was poured upon the
invaders, in an instant, as thinned their ranks and compelled them to
retreat.
12. They soon rallied, however, and came on as before, but were
repulsed a second time with great loss, and fled down the hill. The
green field was covered with dead bodies. General Howe had not an
officer left him on the field. General Clinton now came over from
Copp's Hill, with new troops, and the battle was renewed with more
spirit than ever.
13. At this critical moment, the powder of the Americans failed
them, and they began to retreat, fighting with their muskets, as if
they had been clubs, as they went along. They retired westward as
far as Prospect Hill. where they began to throw up new works.
The British were not disposed to pursue them -nor had the Americans the power to drive them from Bunker's Hill.
14. In this hard-fought battle, the British had two hundred and
twenty-six killed, and eight hundred and twenty-eight wounded. Of
the Americans one hundred and thirty-nine were killed, and three
hundred and fourteen wounded and missing. Among the slain of
the Americans was General Joseph Warren; among the British the

5. They soon came to land, and, continuing their voyage, discovered a country of grapes, which they named Vinland, or the Land
of Wine. The party returned to Greenland, but, soon after, Thorwald pursued the discovery in the same ship. Having landed on a
beautiful shore, he fell in with savages, and was killed by them.
His party escaped and returned to Greenland, whence still other
expeditions were sent to the newly discovered country.
6. Though the accounts of these voyag(es are somewhat vague,
there is no good reason to doubt that these Northmen actually discovered the coast of New England, and for some time were in the
habit of making voyages-thither. Cape Cod, Nantucket, Martha's
Vineyard, and other places, are described in their accounts too accurately to admit of serious doubt as to their identity.
7. The knowledge of Vinland, however, appears not to have been
generally communicated to Europe, and it was finally lost to the
Northmen themselves. After the year 1120, we hear nothinga of it
in their annals, and all traces of such a country were entirely obliterated from the minds of men. At the period of Columbus, the existence of America was as complete a secret as if the hardy Norwe
gians had never ploughed these northern seas.

15. The death of General Warren was greatly lamented by the
Americans. He was a physician, and greatly beloved both in his
profession and private life. He had received the commission of Major
General just three days before the battle, and was only thirty-five
years of age. He rushed into this battle as a mere volunteer. He
was killed almost instantly by a ball in the head, on or near the spot
where now stands Bunker Hill monument.
CHAPTER LXXXVIII.
General Putnam.
1. THis is a proper place to say something of the principal commander * of the army of Bunker's Hill,- Colonel Putnam, afterward
Major General Putnam. Till the French and Indian war broke out,
in 1754, he was a farmer in Connecticut, and nothing had occurred in
his life worthy of much notice, except his adventure with a wolf,
which is so familiar to every school-boy that it need not be related
here.
2. Throughout the whole of the French and Indian war, which
lasted about nine years, General Putnam was employed as an officer;
first as a captain, afterward as a major, and still later, as a colonel.

No ofleor wNas more bold or sliilful; few were more successful or
more beloved.
3. In August, 1757, while stationed in the northern part of New
York, he was engaged in a severe contest with the French and
Indians, in which he was taken prisoner and tied to a tree. The
battle went on, and, as it turned out, Putnam stood for some time in
the hottest fire of both parties. Many balls lodged in the tree near
him, and some pierced his clothes.
4. But he was reserved for further trials. Even before he was
loosed from this very tree, when the colonial troops had, in one
instance, retreated a little way, a young Indian amused himself by
throwinrg his tomahawk at the tree, apparently to see how near he
could thirow it without hitting Putnam. In several instances, it came
within a hair's breadth of him.
5. He was at length untied, but not till he had been cruelly treated
by a French officer, who struck him heavily on the cheek. Hie was
next deprived of his vest, stockings and shoes, and his hands tied
together; and then loaded with the packs of the wounded soldiers.
6. The cords were tied so tightly round his wrists, as to cause
much swelling and great pain, and the blood flowed-from his torn and
naked feet, till his sufferings became so great that he begged the
savages either to loosen the cord or kill him. A French officer
removed a part of the burden, and an Indian gave him a pair of
moccasins.
7. During the day, an Indian had also wounded him deeply in the
cheek with a tomahawk. But the arrival of night brought greater
trials than before. It was the plan of the savages to burn him. He
was bound to a tree, entirely naked, and the flames were kindled, and
the Indians had already begun their horrid dancing and singing around
him.
8. A sudden shower partly extinguished the flames, but they soon
raged again. Already was he beginning to writhe in torture, and
his case becoming hopeless, when a young French officer, rushing
through the throng, dashed away the fire-brands, and though he was
almost past feeling, liberated him from his sufferings.
9. Suffice it to say that he was sent as a prisoner, first to Ticonderoga, (then a British post,) and afterward to Montreal, where he was
exchanged, upon which he immediately reentered the army. He
served under General Amherst in the expedition to the West Indies,
in 1762; was out in an expedition against the Western Indians, in
1764; and after serving nearly ten years in the army, he returned to
his plough.
10. We hear no more of him, except that he was bitterly opposed
to the stamp act, till the news of the battle of Lexington reached him.
He was ploughing in his field; but he left the plough standing in the
furrow, and, without staying to change his clothes, rode to the scene
happened in 1757? 4, 5, 6. Describe the trials to which he was exposed. 7. What

of war. Subsequently to this he was, as will be seen, concerned in
many of the most important battles of the Revolution. He died May,
1790, aged seventy-two years. He was rough in speech and manner
but possessed sterling qualities of head and heart.
CHAPTER LXXXIX.
Washington at the head of the Army.
1. THE second continental congress met, according to the provisions of the first, at Philadelphia, May 20, 1775. At this meeting,
twelve of the colonies were fairly represented. Georgia, it seems,
did not send in her delegates till some time in July. Mr. Randolph
was again chosen their president.
2. At the opening of the congress, John Hancock presented the
most ample and conclusive evidence that, in the battle of Lexington,
the king's troops were the first aggressors. The delegates were
united in the opinion that it was necessary to put the colonies in a
state of defence, and, though they should continue to hope for the
best, to miake all possible preparation for the worst which could
happen.
3. For the purposes of defence they voted to raise and equip an
army of twenty thousand men, and to issue bills of credit to the
amount of three million of dollars to pay the expenses - the twelve
colonies being pledged for their redemption.  They next proceeded

to elect George Washington, one of the delegates from Virginia,
who was already favorably known, commander-in-chief of the
army.
4. The following anecdote will serve to show, in a striking maner, the modesty of Washington. The elder President Adams, then
a member of congress from Massachusetts, was the person who
first proposed to make the appointment.  Though he does not
appear to have called Washington by name, at first, yet his allusions
were so strong that no one could mistake his mbaning, upon which
Washington sprang from   his seat and retired to an adjoining
room.
5. One more fact, in this place, concerning him. Before his
appointment, five hundred dollars a month had been voted to the
chief commander of the army. After Washington's appointment,
he most respectfully assured congress that he did not wish to receive
any profit from the office. " I will keep an accoLnt," said he, "of
my expenses; -these, I doubt not, they will discharge; and that is
all I desire."
0. Four major-generals and eight brigadier-generals, to serve under
Washington, were also appointed.  The names of the first were
Artemas Ward, Charles Lee, Philip Schuyler, and Israel Putnam.
Those of the second were Seth Pomeroy, Richard Montgomery,
David Wooster, William Heath, Joseph Spencer, John Thomas,
John Sullivan and Nathaniel Greene.
7. At this critical period in the history of the colonies, congress
appointed a general or national fast -the first of the kind ever kept
in this country. The season, as it appears, was religiously observed.
[t was the 20th of July.
8. The appointment of Washington, as commander-in-chief of the
army, was made on the 15th of June. He received his commission
four days afterwards. In company with Generals Lee and Schuyler,
he left Philadelphia for the north on the 21st of June, and after a little
delay in New York - where he left General Schuyler- he arrived
at Cambridge, near Boston, on the 2d of July.

Attack on Quebec.

Boston amounted to eleven thousand five hundred. The American

forces were nominally about seventeen thousand; though, exclusively
of the sick and absent, really but fourteen thousand five hundred.
As they were arranged, however, in a semi-circle of about twelve
miles in length, they were thought insufficient for besieging closely
the city.
2. Washington, as soon as he had taken a survey of the whole
ground, called a council of war. This council, without a dissenting
voice, gave it as their opinion that the posts around Boston, though
numerous, must be occupied and sustained; and that, for this purpose, a force of at least twenty-two thousand men was necessary.
They also recommended to the colonies of New England to make up
the deficiency.
3. One great difficulty which stared them in the face was the want
of ammunition. Washington had found, to his surprise, that there
was not powder enough in the whole American army to furnish nine
cartridges to each man. This was a most trying fact, and perplexed
even the commander himself.
4. While he was employed in organizing the army near Boston, so
as to render it available, Generals Schuyler and Montgomery had
taken fort Chamblee, in the north, and besieged St. John's. The
latter was also at length taken, with six hundred prisoners and five
hundred stands of arms. It was during the siege of St. John's that
Colonel Allen was taken prisoner.
5. After the capture of St. John's, General Montgomery went
against Montreal, which surrendered without resistance. He next
marched against Quebec; but, in the mean time, Washington had
despatched General Benedict Arnold, with eleven hundred men, by

way of the Kennebec river, seven hundred of whose troops had arrived late in the autumn, scaled the heights of Abraham, and placed
themselves before the city.
6. Arnold had, however, been so slow in his operations, after his
arrival in the river near the city, that the enemy was better prepared
for a defence than had been supposed. Besides, he had no artillery,
and only six charges of powder to each man. In these circumstances,
he was obliged to.fall back twenty miles up the river, with his troops,
and wait the arrival of General Montgomery.
7. He was joined by the latter and three hundred men, December
1st, and they proceeded forthwith to the siege of Quebec. After
continuing the- siege till December 31st, they made a desperate
attempt to scale the walls, in which General Mbontgomery and
several of his most valuable officers were slain, and General Arnold
wounded.
8. Being thus defeated in his purpose, Arnold ordered the army
to retire about three miles, where they spent the winter. He had
lost about one hundred men who were killed, and three hundred who
were taken prisoners. In the spring, finding his force too small to
accomplish any important purpose, he left the country; and the posts
which had been taken in this quarter gradually returned into the hands
of the British.
9. The death of General Montgomery was deeply lamented, both
in Europe and America. He was born in Irelaid, and was a most
excellent officer and valuable citizen. His two aids de camps and he
fell at the samne instant. Montgomery was only thirty-eight years of
age. Congress ordered a monument to be erected in New York to
his memory.
10. There were internal troubles, about this time, in Virginia. Lord
D)unmore, the governor, like most of the colonial governors, was no
friend to the colonies. Fearing the colonial troops would seize the
powder of the public magazines, he ordered it to be carried on board
a vessel. He also proceeded to arm and equip several vessels for the
crown; and, when the people would not furnish them with provisions,
he went and burnt Norfolk, a town of about six thousand inhabitants

of him hereafter. For the present it is only necessary to say that he
was more rash than judicious, and that his strange expedition to Quebec proved him to be so.
2. It is true that Washington liked the plan well enough, and
encouraged it; but this does not show that it was not both rash and
hazardous. Washington did not know what a rough and dangerous
route it was, and depended for his information on others, who probably
misrepresented the facts.
a. General Arnold set out in September. He had with him, as
was stated in the preceding chapter, eleven hundred men. Hie had
also a few volunteers, besides, among whom was Aaron Burr, afterwards vice-president of the United States, then on] y twenty years of
age. They went by water to the mouth of the Kennebec river, in tho
usual manner.
Arnold's expedition to Canada.
4. There they procured two hundred batteaux.  These were long,
light flat-boats, for shallow water. The current of the river was
rapid, the bottom rocky, and the navigation often interrupted by falls.
Sometimes they had to transport the baggage by land a while, at others
they were obliged to carry their boats on their shoulders, or drag
them up the rapids with ropes.
5. They had steep precipices to climb, vast shady forests to pass
under, and quagmires to wade through.  They had also deep valleys
to traverse, where the pine-trees were tossing over their heads in the
stormy wind, and where the river was rushing and foaming over the
rocks with a noise like that of the ocean.
6. They were sometimes a whole day in l ravelling four or five
miles, with their baggage laced on their backs, and axes in their
hands to hew a road through the wilderness.  Some of them died at
ington.2 3. What troops had Arnlold? 4. How did the Lroops proceed upon the waLei XTHIE BRITISH DRIVEN FROM BOSTON.
last from mere fatigue; many others became sick and perished, and
all suffered greatly for want of food,
7. Many a young soldier, as he lay down at night on his pillow
of green boughs, hungry and fatigued, and perhaps cold, too, for
the frosty nights had come, thought of the parental home and
fireside, where, perhaps, a mother and sister were weeping for him.
But these thoughts were driven away by the next morning's march.
8. By the time they reached the source of Dead river, a branch
of the Kennebec, their provisions were almost exhausted; and what
remained were damaged, as well as their ammunition, by water which
had got into the batteaux during their passage. The soldiers, it is
said, began to kill anid eat the lean dogs they had with them; and
even this food was esteemed a luxury.
9. The sick had now become so numerous that one of the colonels
was ordered back with them to Boston. He not only obeyed the
orders, but went futrther, and took back his whole regiment of three
hundred or four hundred men. He was tried afterwards for deserting
General Arnold; but the court-martial acquitted him on the ground
that the men must have starved had they remained.
10. But Arnold marched on. For thirty-two days not a human
dwelling was seen.   They arrived, at last, on the mountains,
between the Kennebec and Chaudiere, and found their way down the
latter to Point Levy, opposite Quebec, where they arrived November
9. rThe people were as much amazed, at their arrival, as if so many
ghosts had come among them- which, inldeed, many of themn more
resembled than living beings.
CHAPTER XCII.
The British driven from Boston.
1. TiEi British, all this while, had possession of Boston, Roxbury
neck, and Bunker's Hill, and the command of the harbor and shipping. They, therefore, had free access to such supplies as camie to
them over the water. But it happened, in one instance, in the winter
of 1775-6, that the supply of fuel and food fell short, and the army
were put on very scanty allowance.
2. In this extremity, they sent eleven armed vessels to Georgia,
to bring rice; but only two of them could get any, on account
of the hostile state of the public feeling toward them. For fuel, they
used the timber of dwelling-houses and other buildings which they
pulled down for that purpose, and even of some of the churches.
3. In the spring of 1776, efforts were made in England to raise
troops for the American war, but they were not very successful.

167THE BRITISH DRIVEN FROM BOSTON.
The war was not popular among the common people there, and only a
few thousand soldiers were enlisted. At length a bargain was made
by the government for seventeen thousand German troops, called
Hessians, because they carne from the small state of Hesse. These
were all sent over to America.
4. General Howe had succeeded General Gage in the command
at Boston, some time in the year 1775. About the end of December,
Washington had discovered that a plan was on foot for making an
attack on some part of the coast- perhaps New York. To prevent
this, as well as to gain possession of Boston, he began to meditate an
attack on the town.
5. It had been his purpose to make the attack in February, when
both Charles river and the harbor were firmly frozen over; but in a
council of. war the plan was opposed, and he yielded his opinion,
though he did it reluctantly. It was now determined to get possession of the Dorchester (South Boston) Heights, which commanded
the harbor.
6. On the 2d of March the movement was begun. To conceal his
real design from the enemy, Washington first made an attack on
the town from Cambridge and Lechmere's Point with bomib-shells.
This was continued for two or three days, especially at evening.
The object was to divert the attention of the British from Dorchester
Heights.
7. During the night of March 4, 1776, immediately after the
firing began ftom Cambridge and elsewhere, General Thomas, with
eight hundred men, and a working party of twelve hundred, with
the necessary tools, passed over from Roxbury, as silently as possible, to the heights, and went to work. The ground was very hard,
but by daylight they were able so far to complete an entrenchment,
that it served to shield them, in a good degree, from the shot of the
enemy.
8. When the British saw these works in the morning, they were
greatly astonished. They perceived, in a moment, what an advantage they gave to the Americans, and that they must either dislodge
them or give up the town. They sent out two thousand troops
against them in boats, but a storm prevented them from landing so as
to act in concert.
9. At a council of war, held next morning, it was determined to
quit the town. But as they did not depart at once, the Americans
continued to strengthen and extend their works, till, on the 17th of
March, they had made such progress that the British dared not
remain longer; and by ten o'clock in the forenoon they were all
under sail.
10. Great was the joy of the Boston people when they saw the
last of the British troops embark, and a division of Washington's
army, under General Putnam, marching triumphantly over the neck

into the town.  Washington himself, with the rest of his army,
entered next day amid general acclamations.
11. Boston must have presented a dismal spectacle at this time.
For sixteen months it had been subjected to all the distresses of a
close siege, and to all the multiplied abuses of a foreign soldiery.
Churches had been used for quarters for the soldiers, and their furniture and benches destroyed, and shops and houses, in many instances,
pillaged of goods and clothing.
12. The suffering of the citizens, for want of food and fuel, had
become extreme. Wood could not be had for less than ten dollars a
cord; fish was twenty-two cents a pound; ham forty-five cents; ducks
a dollar apiece; turkeys three dollars; sheep eight dollars, and
vegetables could scarcely be had. Apples were seven or eight dollars a barrel. Some, in the scarcity of food, were glad to eat horseflesh.
13. Yet there were some who did not share in the general joy at
seeing the British depart. They believed America was wrong in
resisting the parent country, and could not conscientiously afford their
aid. They were called tories or refugees. More than a thousand
such - some say fifteen hundred - left the town with the British
fleet for Halifax; and many never returned.
14. The Boston people, after the battle of Lexington, had been
permitted to leave the town with their effects, provided they lodged
their arms in Faneuil Hall; and nearly two thousand fire-arms and
six hundred and thirty-four pistols, &amp;c., had been deposited there.
They now began to return. These and the army of Washington,
consisting of twenty-one thousand eight hundred regular troops and
six thousand eight hundred militia, gave quite a new appearance to
the face of things.
CHAPTER XCIII.
Battle at Sullivan's Island.
i. DRIVEN from Boston, the British now turned their thoughts
toward New York and Charleston. The attack on Charleston was
to be attempted first. For this-purpose the British Admiral Sir Peter
Parker and General Clinton, having met at Cape Fear, sailed to the
south, and, on the 4th of June, anchored about six miles from the
city.

twenty-eight guns, and several smaller vessels. The land forces of

changes which have taken place in this comparatively short "period!
Instead of a mere wilderness, or at best an abode of savages, much
of the continent is now peopled by civilized men, and thickly studded
with cities, towns, and villages.
2. Columbus was a native of Genoa, in Italy, and was born A. D.
1435. He was chiefly employed, till he was fourteen years of age,
with his father, in combihg wool. He was exceedingly fond of
books, but the circumstances of his father did not allow him to indulge
his natural fondness for them. He was particularly pleased with
books of voyages and travels, and early manifested a desire to see
foreign countries.
3. At length he was allowed to go to sea. His first voyages were
in the Mediterranean. Of these history tells but little. We know
that he was employed, for a time, in a war between the Venetians
and the Mohammedans, and that, in one instance, when the vessel to
which he belonged had taken fire, he saved his life by swimming.
4. But Columbus was too active and enterprising to be always
confined to the narrow limits of the Mediterranean. He travelled to
almost every part of the world which was then known; and his practical mind at length led him to contemplate a voyage to parts which,
as yet, had not been even thought of, by most persons.
5. The mariners of the fifteenth century knew little of foreign
countries. Their knowledge was chiefly confined to the coasts and
islands of Europe. They had never ventured so far along the shores
of Africa as to cross the equator. The trade with the East Indies
was at that time carried on by land, and the West Indies were of
course undiscovered.
6. The strong desire which was felt by commercial men to find out
a path to the East Indies by water, led to much conversation on the
subject; and some persons began to think and speak of the probability
of reaching that part of the world by sailing round the southern point
of Africa. But Columbus had a plan which extended still further.
7. Having learned, from books of geography and astronomy, that
the earth was round, it very naturally occurred to him that there
might be more land somewhere to counterpoise what was already
known on one side of the globe; and that it was at least quite possible to find the East Indies by sailing westward.
8. But what was to be done? He and his friends were poor, and
it would require much money to fit out an expedition like that which
the prosecution of his schemes woulld demand. He was therefore
compelled to seek the patronage and pecuniary aid of others.
9. He first explained his views and stated his plans to the senate
of his native country, Genoa; and subsequently to the king of Portugal and the king and queen of Spain. They heard him with patience, but, believing him to be somewhat visionary, were not disposed
to afford him the necessary aid. Still he was not discouraged.

General Clinton were twenty-eight hundred. Their anchorage was
only three miles from Sullivan's Island, which the Americans had
fortified, and which was defended by three hundred and seventy-five
regular soldiers and a few militia.
3. Before proceeding against Charleston itself, it was thought
advisable to destroy the works on Sullivan's Island. An attack was
therefore made on the 28th of June, a little before noon. The fort
on the island was built of palmetto wood, so spongy that the shot
buried themselves in it, without shivering it to pieces. It was
defended, moreover, by sixty pieces of cannon.
4. For ten long hours, the contest was terrible. Ship after ship
poured in upon the fort its tremendous broadsides. The Americans
also fought with great energy and effect. The whole harbor seemed
to be in a flame. Two of the vessels were soon disabled, and a
third almost destroyed, while great numbers of their men were slain.
5. In one instance the fire of the fort completely ceased. Their
powder was exhausted. The British now thought themselves sure
of victory. But a new supply of powder came, and the battle went
on hotter than ever for a considerable time longer.
6. In another instance, the flag-staff of the fort being shot away,
a sergeant, by the name of Jasper, leaped down upon the beach, took
up the flag, and, in spite of the incessant firing of the shipping,
mounted and placed it again upon the rampart. This sergeant was
afterwards presented with a sword and a commission; but the latter
he refused to accept.
7. The firing ceased between nine and ten in the evening, and
the ships hauled off. They were exceedingly shattered, and two
hundred of their men were killed or wounded.  The Americans had
but ten killed and twenty-two wounded; though the damage done
to the island was immense- every hut and even every tree being
destroyed.
8. This defence of Sullivan's Island was considered as one of the
nmost brilliant events of the revolutionary war. Great credit was
given to the commanding officer, Colonel Moultrie, in honor of whom
the fort was afterwards called Fort Moultrie.

of among the people; but here it became an early topic of discussion
by their delegates.
2. The first resolution of this body, on the subject, was introduced
June 7, by Richard Henry Lee, one of the delegates from Virginia.
It was, " that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be,
free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance
to the British crown; and that all political connection between
them and the state of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved."
3. His speech, on introducing that resolution, was one of the most
eloquent ever heard in the councils of America, and drew forth able
remarks from others. On the 11th of June, it was still further discussed, and again on the 1st of July. On the 2d of July, a committee
was elected to draft a declaration according to the spirit of Mr. Lee's
resolution.
4. This committee, consisting of Thomas Jefferson, of Vir,,inia,
John Adams, of Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin, of Pennsylvania
Roger Sherman, of Connecticut, and Robert R. Livingston, of New
York, reported a Declaration of Independence, which, on the 4th of
July, was adopted and ordered to be handsomely engrossed onr parchment, to be signed.
5. By this instrument the thirteen American colonies declared
themselves Free and Independent, under the name of the Thirteen
United States of America. It was signed, on the 2d of August, by
all the members of the congress then present, and by some who had
not been present on the 4th of July. Their number was fiftysix.
6. To sign such an instrument as this, in such circumstances,
required no little firmness. It would be regarded by Great Britain as
treason, and might bring a person to the most violent or ignominious
death. Yet the hand-writing of the signers, as may be seen by the
copies of the declaration which are preserved, is firm, except in the
case of Stephen Hopkins, an aged man, who had the palsy.
7. None of these signers of the Declaration of Independence are
now living, though most of them lasted to a good old age. Four
lived beyond the age of ninety; fourteen exceeded eighty; and
twenty-three exceeded seventy. Their average age was about sixtyfive. The average age of the delegates from New England was
seventy-five.
8. This fact of their great age has been sometimes adduced as a
proof of the Divine approbation and blessing on the cause they
espoused. To a truly philosophic mind, however, it only proves that
life is prolonged and health promoted by living for such purposes as
develop all our powers, instead of spending ourselves in the depths of
ignorance, listlessness or selfishness.

great moral revolution, on the eve of which we live, by rousing the
whole being -the moral and religious, no less than the intellectual
powers -will be still more so  
10. The Declaration of Independence was received, everywhere
throughout the Union, with tokens of approbation. Processions were
formed, bells rang, cannon fired, and patriotic addresses made, accom
panied by all the usual demonstrations of public joy. Such was the
spirit, at least, of the majority; though it must be admitted, there
were those who viewed the whole matter in a very different
ight.
CHAPTER XCV.
Defence of New York.
I  TH.E British began to collect, about this time, on Staten Island,
near New York, in order to make preparation to attack the city.
General Clinton, after the battle at Sullivan's Island, had gone there
with his troops, and General Howe had come there from Halifax,
early in July. Some of the refugee colonists, of New York, had also

BATTLE OF LONG ISLAND.174                 DEFENCE OF NEW YORK.
2. As it had early occurred to General Washington that the
British would aim at New York, he had left Boston, where his
presence was no longer absolutely necessary, and repaired to that
city, accompanied by General Lee; to which place the troops soon
followed him. When collected together, in the city and its vicinity,
they were found to amount to seventeen thousand two hundred and
twenty-four men.
3. About fifteen thousand of the American troops, under Generals
Sullivan and Putnam, were stationed at Brooklyn, on Long Island.
A-part of the British army crossed over from Staten Island to Long
Island, to make a descent upon the Americans. They landed on
Long Island, August 22.
4. On the 27th of August they began an attack, and a battle
ensued, which lasted the whole day, and ceased only with the darkness of the night. The British had the advantage; though it was
procured at the expense of from three hundred to five hundred
men.
5. But the American loss was still greater. More than a thousand
of their number were taken prisoners; and among the rest General
Sullivan and Lord Sterling. From one to two hundred were slain.
About five thousand of the American troops were actively engaged,
who were obliged to sustain the shock of fifteen thousand of the
enemy.
6. One cause of the misfortunes of the Americans this day was,
no doubt, the inexperience of the troops. Another was the want of
suitable officers. One of the generals was sick, and General PutWashington done? What troops had he at New York! 3. What troops were sent to

nam, though as brave a man as there was in the army, had but
recently arrived, and was unacquainted with the ground.
7. The British army encamped within half a mile of the American
lines, and on the following day began to make preparations to renew
the attack, confidently expecting that they should speedily be able to
cut off the whole army. In this, however, they were disappointed;
for, when they were ready for the attack, not an American was to be
found on the island.
8. Under the personal care and inspection of Washington, who
had crossed from New York and joined the army the day before the
battle, the American troops recrossed to the city, on the morning of
the 30th, just in time to save themselves. They had moved chiefly
in the night and under cover of a fog. Indeed, the British were so
near the last troops who embarked, that they distinctly heard their
movements.
9. Upon the. retreat of the American army from Long Island,
Washington gave vent to his feelings in a manner which was not at
all usual with him. He had been on horseback, continually, two or
three days and nights, and had not closed his eyes in sleep for the
whole time, and was, therefore, but poorly prepared to endure the
mortification of a defeat.
10. As it was expected that the British would forthwith attack
New York, a council of war was called, in which it was at length
determined to evacuate the city. After removing the military stores
and baggage to Kingsbridge, fifteen miles from the city, about nine
thousand of the troops followed, and the remainder soon afterwards
The British took possession of New York, September 15.
CHAPTER XCVI.
Battle of White Plains. - Retreat of Washington.
1. AFTER leaving three thousand troops to garrison Fort Lee, on
the Hudson, Washington had retreated from Kingsbridge, and entrenched himself at White Plains, thirty miles from New York.
The British, after gaining some advantages in a skirmish at Harlem
Heights, near the city, slowly pursued the retreating army, and
overtook them at their encampment at White Plains.
2. Here, October 28, a considerable action took place, and several
hundreds fell on both sides. It would not be easy, however, to say
which party was victorious. Washington did not leave his position,
and the British did not immediately advance. Finding, however,
that the enemy had received a reinforcement, soon after the battle,
Washington retreated five miles to North Castle.

3. Here he left seven thousand five hundred men under General
Lee, anid then crossed the Iludson with the rest of his troops, and
stationed himself in the neighborhood of Fort Lee, on the New
Jersey shore. Forts Lee and Washington were on the banks of the
Hudson, ten miles above New York, and commanded the navigation
of the river.
4. On the 15th of November, the British went against Fort Washingtox. A summons was sent to Colonel Magaw, the commander,
to surrender, on pain of being- put to the sword. As he refused to
comply, an attack was made the next morning with such fuiry that
when a second summons was sent, the colonel was glad to capitulate.
All his men, amounting now to about two thousand six hundred,
were made prisoners.
5. The British army sustained a heavy loss in the conflict -from
eight hundred to one thousand men. But, being determined to follow up the victory, they soon proceeded, under Lord Cornwallis, to
attack Fort Lee, on the other side of the river. This was commanded by General Greene. As the British forces were evidently
too strong for him, he evacuated it before he lost the opportunity.
6. General Greene was a humane man, as is evident from his
unwillingness on this and other occasions to expose, to no good purpose, the lives of his men. He was the son of a Quaker preacher
in Rhode Island, and was fond of learning, though he had but few
opportunities for study.
7. He had first signalized himself in the battle of Lexington,
before which he had been engaged either in studying or school teaching. Law was the profession at which he aimed, and in which his
natural inclination and great perseverance would have made him successful, had he not been called away in early life to share the fortunes
of war.
8. The whole American army now retreated through New Jersey
towards Philadelphia,- the British closely following them. The
pursuit was so very close that the hindmost forces of the Americans
were sometimes in sight of the bridges they had passed over
and pulled down after them, when the British were building them up
again.
9. This was a calamitous hour to the Americans. When the
retreat commenced, the American forces scarcely exceeded four
thousand; and when they crossed the Delaware, at Trenton, the
number of effective men was reduced to three thousand. Even
this force, poorly fed and sustained, was daily and hourly diminishing.
10. Washington, however, in the midst of all this discouragrement, did not allow himself to be depressed. While all else wore
the appearance of gloom - even the countenances of the soldiers -
he then station himself? 4. Describe the engagement. 5. What was next done by the

Washington was serene and cheerful. Trusting to the justice of the
cause he had espoused, and to Heaven, he persevered, in the midst
of difficulties which would at least have shaken the constancy of many
who have deserved the name of very brave men.
11. On the very day of Washington's retreat over the Delaware,
the British forces took possession of Rhode Island, and blocked
up a squadron of American vessels there, and a number of privateers
at Providence. The island was held by the king's forces two or
three years.
CHAPTER XCVII.
Battle at Trenton.
1. PHILADELPHIA being every day in danger of becoming the seat
of war, congress, in December, 1776, adjourned to Baltimore;
not, however, till they had drawn up and adopted certain articles
of Confederation, in spirit not unlike the Federal Constitution adopted
many years afterward. These they sent to the respective assemblies
of each state for approbation.  They also gave nearly absolute
power to General Washington to conduct the military affairs of the
country.
2. After crossing the Delaware river into Pennsylvania, Washington very fortunately received a reinforcement of about fifteen hundred men, besides a considerable body of militia; so that he had
now with him an army of seven thousand. But, as the term of
enlistment with a large proportion of his older troops would expire
at the end of the year, Washington was anxious to effect something
immediately.
3. The British army was yet at Trenton. Washington's plan
was to recross the Delaware and attack them in their quarters. It
was late in the season, being December 25; and, to use a wellknown phrase, "as cold as Christmas."  Yet, neither Washington
nor his troops were to be deterred by this.
4. At night, the army, in three divisions, attempted to cross the
river in as many different places. It was not only cold, but dark and
stormy. The river was crowded with broken ice, rushing together
and sweeping down its rapid current. The division commanded by
Washington in person was alone successful. This got safely over,
and, at eight in the morning, they were before Trenton.
5. They first attacked a body of Hessians, who, after a most
determined resistance, at length surrendered. From nine hundred
to one thousand of them were made prisoners, with some cannon

Five hundred cavalry alone made their escape.    This brilliant
achievement, at a moment of great despondency, roused the spirits
of our army, and kindled anew the flagging hopes of the country.
6. As Washington did not think it prudent to hazard anything
more at present, he immediately returned to the Pennsylvania side of
the Delaware with his prisoners. But having refreshed his troops
and secured his prisoners, he crossed once more to Trenton, and took
up his head quarters there.
7. Their success at Trenton had infused new courage into the
American troops, and Washington was determined to make the most
of it. It was soon found that the British were concentrating their
forces at Princeton and preparing for battle. On the 2d of January,
1777, they came on to Trenton. On their approach, Washington
retired with his forces and posted himself on the opposite bank
of a rivulet, from which he kept up a firing upon the eiamy till
night.
8. At dark, the firing ceased on both sides. Cornwallis encamped
with his troops near the village, expecting to receive a reinforcement
early the next morning, when he should be well prepared to renew
the attack. The fires kindled by the two armies were in full view of
each other.
9. The situation of the Americans was exceedingly critical. The
forces of Cornwallis, if they were concentrated at Trenton, as there
was reason to expect, were greatly superior to those of Washington. If a battle should be hazarded in the morning it was with
almost a certainty of being defeated. But the Delaware could not
now be crossed with safety, on account of the broken ice.
10. But there was another difficulty in the way of recrossing the
river. It would leave New Jersey wholly to the enemy, depress the
public mind, check the enlistment of recruits, of which the army stood
in great need, and leave open the door to an attack on Philadelphia.
CHAPTER XCVIII.
Battle near Princeton.
1. THE final determination was to march by a circuitous route, as
quickly as possible, to Princeton, and, if possible, proceed to Brunswick, where Lord Cornwallis had stores. In order, however, to
secure the baggage, Washington had it removed, as secretly as possible, to Burlington.

10. Hie had by this time drawn into his service his two younger
brothers, Bartholomew and Diego. Bartholomew had even been sent
to England, to solicit aid from Henry VII.; but the vessel in which
he went was taken by pirates, and nothing more was heard, for some
time, either of him or his undertaking.
11. In the mean time, the appeal to the king and queen of Spain
had been renewed, and after the lapse of about eight years, it succeeded. Ferdinand and Isabella agreed to furnish three small vessels
and ninety men, and provisions for one year. Such an outfit was
thought exceedingly liberal; and queen Isabella even parted with her
jewels to aid in paying the expenses.
12. The names of the three vessels that thus set out for America,
were the Santa Maria, the Pinta, and the Nina. The two latter
were mere barks, but the Santa Maria, Columbus' own vessel, was
of considerable size. In addition to a crew of ninety men, about
th;rty other persons went out with them as mere adventurers.

to deceive the British, the fires were left unextinguished, and the
guards even remained to keep them burning brightly, and also to
watch the bridge and fords of the rivulet till daylight, when they
were to follow the army.  The project succeeded to a charm, and a
little after sunrise, next morning, Washington's army was seen
approaching Princeton.
3. Here he met with some British: regiments on the march, and
one of the hottest battles ensued which was fought during' the whole
war. At first, the British,  fixed bayonets, compelled the Americans to retreat, with considerable loss, and, among the rest that' of
General Mercer of Virginia.
4. Washington, with the main body of' the army, now came on,
and renewed the attack with great spirit.  Contrary to' his usual
policy, and the policy of war generally, he exposed himself, for a
time, to the hottest fire of the enemy. At length, victory was declared in favor of the Americans.
5. But it was dearly bought. In addition to the brave General
Mercer, two colonels from Pennsylvania, and several other valuable
officers, were among the slain. The total loss of the Americans was
not stated.  It was only said that while the British lost one hundred
killed and three hundred prisoners, the American loss was somewhat
less.
6. Lord Cornwallis discovered, at daylight, that the Americans
had escaped, upon which he followed on to Princeton. But he
arrived a little too late to engage in the conflict; Washington having
retired, in his uisual prudent manner, toward Morristown. Hiere the
army took up their quarters for the winter.
7. It was time for them to do so, for it was not only January, but
the troops needed repose, as well as almost everything else. During
their late marches many of them had been without shoes, and their
naked feet, in passing over the frozen ground, were so gashed as to
mark every step with blood. Moreover, there was scarcely a tent in
the whole army.
8. Though the main body of the army was at Morristown, a small
body of troops, under General Putnam, wintered at Princeton. These,
with the volunteers and militia, completely overran New Jersey.
One party surprised Elizabethtown, and took one hundred prisoners.
Another took sixty refugees, on British pay. Another, still, besides
some prisoners, took forty wagons, one hundred horses, &amp;c. General
Putnam, alone, with his small army, captured, during the winter,
about one thousand prisoners!

of arms and one thousand barrels of powder. At the same time, also,
ten thousand stands of arms arrived in another quarter.
10. It is also worthy of remark that the small-pox having appeared
among the regular troops at Morristown, during the winter, Washington had his soldiers, nearly all, inoculated. The disease was light,
except in a very few instances; not a day passing in which they could
not, had they been called upon, have encountered ti enemv
CHAPTER XCIX.
Attack on Danbury, in Connecticut.
1. IN the spring of 1777, the British commander in New York
amused himself by sending out detachments of troops to ravage the
country.  One of these was sent against some military stores at
Peekskill, on the east side of the Hudson, about fifty miles above
New York. On its approach, the Americans fired the store-houses
and retired.
2. On the 26th of April, General Tryon, with a detachment of two
thousand men, made an expedition to Connecticut for a similar purpose. He landed near Fairfield, and marched through the country,
with the greatest possible speed, and almost without opposition, to
Danbury.
3. The few militia who were at Danbury fled to a neighboring
height, and waited for a reinforcement. The British, in the mean
time, destroyed eighteen houses, eight hundred barrels of pork and
beef, eight hundred barrels of flour, and two thousand bushels of
grain. Seventeen hundred tents were also either destroyed or carried
away. Nothing was spared but the houses of the tories.
4. On their return through Ridgefield, they found the road blocked
up by General Arnold with five hundred men. They also soon found
themselves attacked in the rear by Generals Wooster and Silliman,
with a force of three hundred. A skirmish ensued, in which General
Wooster was slain and his troops driven back. They then proceeded
and were met by General Arnold.
5. A sharp conflict ensued. A whole platoon fired at Arnold
when he was not over thirty yards distant, but they only killed his
horse. A soldier advanced towards him with his bayonet, but Arnold
shot him dead with his pistol, and escaped. But two thousand regular troops were too strong for eight hundred raw militia, and the latter
were dispersed.
6. Arnold returned to the attack next day, at eleven o'clock, and

opposed the British till five in the afternoon, when they reached their
ships. Here they even charged upon them, but were repulsed. The
British, upon this, embarked for New York; not, however, without
the loss of nearly two hundred of their men.
7. Arnold behaved, on this occasion, with great bravery; as,
indeed, up to this hour, he always had done. On account of his
good conduct, congress presented him with a fine, nobly dressed
war horse. To the memory of General Wooster, they ordered a
monument to be erected.
CHAPTER C.
Battle of the Brandywine.
1. DURING the spring of this year, Washington remained entrenched among the hills of New Jersey - the army daily and
hourly gaining strength by new recruits. His forces, at length,
amounted to fifteen thousand men, and the British were becoming
afraid of him. In the latter part of the spring, his camp was at Middlebrook.
2. News was received about this time that General Burgoyne,
with a large force, was approaching Ticonderoga; and there was
room for at least a suspicion that he aimed at New England, and it
was thought that the British were likely to pass up the Hudson to
meet and join him, instead of making the long-threatened attack on
Philadelphia
3. This question was settled by the arrival, in the Chesapeake,* in
the month of July, of the British fleet from New York, with sixteen
thousand men, under General Howe. By the 3d of September they
were rapidly approaching Philadelphia. Washington, who had kept
his eye on all their movements, was on the road to meet them. The
two armies met at a place called Chadd's Ford, on the river Brandywine, about thirty miles from Philadelphia.
4. Here, on the 11th of September, a severe battle took place,
which lasted nearly all day. The Americans were, at length, defeated with very great loss. They then made the best of their way
to Chester, where they arrived that night, and the next day they proceeded to Philadelphia.

Woodford and the Marquis de La Fayette. The latter had only just

arrived from France; his commission in the army was dated July
31st. He fought for the Americans (except when absent on their account in France) till the end of the war; and always without pay.
The Polish Count Pulaski also fought for us, for the first time, in this
battle.
6. Washington was very much mortified by this defeat. But
neither the public mind nor congress itself would have been satisfied
without, at least, an attempt to prevent the British from entering
Philadelphia. Indeed, congress advised him to hazard a second battle,
and he was, on the 16th of September, about to do so; but an unexpected shower wet the powder in the cartridge-boxes of the troops,
and he was obliged to give it up.
7. The British also gained some other advantages about this time;
among which may be mentioned the surprise and defeat of General
Wayne. He had been sent with fifteen hundred men to harass the
British, and cut off straggling parties. The enemy, having found out
his position, came suddenly upon him, and killed and wounded about
three hundred of his men.
8. It was at length concluded to quit the city and neighborhood of
Philadelphia, and repair to a strong position on the Schuylkill, twenty
miles northward. The British, on the 26th of September, entered
Philadelphia, and posted the main body of their forces at Germantown,
seven miles to the north.
CHAPTER CI.
Capture of General Prescott.
1. ON the 10th of July, of this year, 1777, while the British, under
General Prescott, had complete possession of the island of Rhode
Island, and lay encamped on the western side of it, one Barton, a
militia colonel, of Warwick, having learned, from a deserter, their
exact position, planned and executed an attack upon them as singular
as it was successful.
2. He first collected together his regiment, and then asked which
of them would hazard their lives in an expedition he was about to undertake. Such, he said, as were willing, might signify it by stepping
two paces forward. As he was known to be worthy of their confidence, every man of them stepped forward.
3. Having made a selection of forty of the boldest and stoutest of
them, and procured five whale-boats, they started off at nine o'clock
in the evening. He directed them to sit perfectly still, like statues,
and merely attend to and obey his orders. His own boat went forCount Pulaski? 6. What mortified Washington? What of congress? 7. What of

ward, and to distinguish it, had a long pole extended from the fore
part, with a handkerchief tied to it.
4. As they rowed by Prudence Island, they heard the English
guard cry, "All's well." A noise was heard on the main land,
like the trampling of horses, but, as it was very dark, nothing could
be seen, and not a whisper was uttered.  At length they landed,
and set off for General Prescott's lodgings, about a mile from the
shore.
5. In going along, they were obliged to pass a house occupied by a
company of cavalry. "Who comes there?" said the sentinel. They
said nothing and moved on. "Who comes there?" said thle sentinel
again. "Friends," said Barton.   "Advance, then, and give the
countersign," said the sentinel.  "We have none," said Barton;
"but have you seen any deserters to-night?"
6. In an instant, the sentinel found himself seized, his musket
wrested from him, and himself pinioned. "Say not a single word,"
said Barton, "on penalty of instant death."  Terribly frightened, and
unable to make any resistance, he yielded to the command, and they
took him along with them.
7. They soon reached a house, burst the door, and rushed in. A
British soldier, in his shirt, ran to awake and rouse the cavalry; but
the men would not believe a word he said, and only laughed at him.
He confessed that the creature he had seen, who it happened was
Colonel Barton, was dressed in white, which only increased the laugh,
and so it ended.
8. "Is General Prescott here?" said Bartont, in a resolute tone,
to the master of the house.   "No, sir," said the poor fellow,
frightened almost to death. Having secured him as a prisoner, they
roceeded to search, but could not find Prescott. At this instant,
Barton, from the head of the stairs, called to his men to fire the house
at the four corners, as he would have General Prescott, either dead
or alive.
9. Fire-brands were already in motion, when somebody in the
next room  asked, "What is the matter?"   Barton burst open the
door, and found an elderly gentleman sitting up in bed. "Are you
General Prescott?" said he. "Yes, sir," was the reply. "You
are my prisoner then," said Barton, clapping him on the shoulder.
He begged the favor of putting on his clothes, but they only wrapped a cloak about him, and a stout negro man carried him to the
boats.
10. Major Barrington had leaped from the window while they were
seizing General Prescott, but he too was taken and hurried away to
the boats. They had scarcely rowed through the British fleet, when
a discharge of cannon convinced them that they were discovered, and
fifty boats were on the pursuit.

his prisoners, soon landed at Warwick Point. "You have made a
bold push, colonel," said General Prescott, as he stepped ashore.
"Thank you," said Barton, with a bow, "we have done as well as
we could."
CHAPTER CII.
The War in the North.
1. THE movements of Burgoyne, at the north, have been alluded
to. He had arrived at Quebec in May of this year, 1777, and while
the British troops in the Middle States had been advancing to Philadelphia, he had begun his march, by way of the river Sorel and Lakes
Champlain and George, to Albany, where he hoped to meet Colonel
St. Leger, who was to come from Lake Ontario, by way of the Mohawk.
2. General Burgoyne was an ambitious, enterprising, and able
officer. Fifteen years before, he had been engaged in the wars of
Great Britain with the Portuguese and Spaniards, and, during the
siege of Boston, he had been, for a short time, employed there. He
set out from Canada with more than seven thousand men, besides
a considerable body of artillery, and a thousand Canadian volunteers.
3. On the 20th of May, he proceeded up Lake Champlain, and
landed near Crown Point, where he met some Indians, to whom he
made a war speech and gave the hand of friendship. Accompanied
by a considerable body of the Indians, he advanced to Crown Point,
and soon afterward to Ticonderoga.
4. This place was defended by three thousand men, under General
St. Clair. At a council of war, it was concluded to leave the fort at
once; but the British came up with the rear of their army, at Hubbardton, as they were leaving it, and a battle ensued, in which two
hundred Americans were killed, six hundred wounded, and two hundred taken prisoners.
5. The invading army reached Fort Edward, on the Hudson, July
30, having destroyed much American property on the road. Here
they made a halt, while the troops, especially the Indian allies, ravaged the country. It was while these soldiers were quartered here
that the famous murder of Miss McRea, a beautiful and accomplished
American lady, took place.
6. She was to have been married, soon, to a young Englishman,
and he had sent two Indians, whom he considered trusty, to guide
her across the woods to the place where he was stationed. On

their way, the Indians fell into a quarrel whi h should have the
offered reward for transporting her, when, to end the dispute, one of
them killed her with his tomahawk.
7. General Schuyler, who had commanded Fort Edward previous
to the arrival of Burgoyne, had with him a force of about four thousand four hundred men. On the approach of the enemy, he had
annoyed them greatly by felling trees in the roads and destroying
bridges; but finding them too strong for him, he had abandoned the
fort, and retreated across the Hudson to Saratoga.
8. Colonel St. Leger, with an army of regulars, New York
tories and Indians, had by this time approached Fort Schuyler, at
the head of the Mohawk river, where Rome now stands, and laid
siege to it. A body of militia, on their way to act in its defence, was
ambushed by the Indians, and four hundred of them killed, mortally
wounded, or taken.
9. After much skirmishing, and some hotly contested battles, in
the neighborhood of the fort, in which victory was alternately on the
side of the British and the Americans, General Arnold, who had been
sent to the relief of the fort, and who was not wanting in ingenuity,
devised a stratagem for drawing off the Indians from St. Leger's
army, which so weakened it that he was compelled to raise the siege.
CHAPTER CIII.
Battle of Bennington.
1. WHILE Burgoyne, with his army, was at Fort Edward, ne
learned that the Americans had a considerable amount of military
stores and provisions at Bennington. With a view to secure them,
he sent out Colonel Baum, a brave German officer, with five hundred
German troops and one hundred Indians.
2. According to a manuscript order of General Burgoyne's, the
number of these Germans was three times as great as has just been
stated. But whether there was fifteen hundred or only five hundred, they were not only very clumsy, but very inefficient troops.
Their hats and swords, alone, weighed nearly as much as the whole
equipment of a common soldier; and they could scarcely march under
their weight.
3. When Colonel Baum, with his troops, was within seven miles of
Bennington, he learned that the Americans were strongly entrenched,
and were hourly expecting a reinforcement. He, therefore, halted,
sent back information to Burgoyne, and waited for further orders.
Burgoyne immediately sent five hundred more German troops to his
assistance.

187BATTLE OF BENNINGTON.
4. But before the arrival of these last, General Stark, with a body
of New Hampshire and Massachusetts militia, had determined to
attack Colonel Baum in his position. The battle began about three
o'clock in the afternoon, Auguist 16, whlen the Germans were defeated and dispersed, and Colonel Baum mortally wounded.
5. The pursuit of the Americans was checked, for the moment,
by the arrival of the reinforcement which Burgoyne had sent; but
the latter soon expended their ammunition, and were obliged to
retreat with their companions, with a loss of six hundred in killed
and prisoners, besides one thousand stands of arms and nine hundred
swords.
6. It is said that in order to animate his soldiers, who were unused
to war, General Stark, before the opening of the battle, appealed
thus to their sympathies: "My fellow-soldiers," said he, " we
conquer to-day, or to-night Mary Stark is a widow." The appeal
had effect; the soldiers fought as if in full view of their homes and
firesides.
7. General Stark had been in the old French and Indian war,
and was once taken prisoner by the Indians.    He was also at
Bunker Hill and Trenton. He was a brave man and good citizen;
was the last surviving general of the American revolution. He died
at Manchester, in New Hampshire, in 1822, aged ninety-four
years.
8. After St. Leger abandoned the siege of Fort Schuyler, he
returned to Montreal. Both he and Burgoyne had done their utmost
to effect a junction of their troops at Albany, but had been hindered
more by the Americans than they expected. The condition of Burgoyne, moreover, was now becoming, every day, less and less agreeable, as well as safe.
9. On the 21st of August, General Gates arrived at the American
camp; congress, on the 4th, having given to him the command of the
northern army. General Arnold also joined them about the same
time. Burgoyne, however, continued to advance; it being easier for
him to get forward than backward.
10. The two armies mret, on the 19th of September, near Stillwater, only twenty-two miles from Albany. A severe battle was
fought for four hours, which was only checked by night and darkness. Both armies, however, had suffered so much that they did not
choose to renew the battle next morning. They were in sight of each
other till October 7, when a second battle was fought, in which Burgoyne was defeated.

of August 13th, 1492. Their course was south-westward till they
reached the Canary islands, after which they proceeded exactly west.
They had a good deal of unfavorable weather, and were forty days in
reaching the West Indies.
3. The seamen grew tired of the voyage, and once became mutinous. Columbus, though an old commander, was greatly troubled with
them; but he contrived in one way or another to keep them from open
rebellion. At length, on the 21st of October, they faintly discovered
land; and on the 22d, they were alongside of a beautiful green island.
4. This proved to be what was called by the natives, Guanahaui,
one of the Bahamas; but Columbus named it St. Salvador. It was
several leagues in extent, and had inhabitants upon it. Columbus,
who had been the first to discover land the night before, was the first
to go onI shore in the morning.
5. As soon as hie had landed, he knelt and kissed the new earth, at
the same time thanking God, who had prospered their enterprise.
His men, impatient and mutinous as they had been during the voyage,
now crowded around him and begged his forgiveness. The scene
must have been truly affecting.
6. The native inhabitants of the island- naked, copper-colored,
with long black hair, and without beards -gathered around the new
comers, not knowing what to make of them. They looked at the ships
with even greater amazement than at the men; regarding them, as
some gigantic species of animal; and when some guns were discharged, they thought they had eyes of fire and voices of thunder.
7. When Columbus had spent a little time in examining the new
island, he proceeded to make further discoveries. Cuba was seen,
November 7th, and Ilispaniola or St. Domingo not long afterwards.
These, however, were all the lands which were discovered during
this first voyage. As Columbus supposed these to be a part of the
Indies, they afterwards acquired the name of the West Indies.
Columbus set out on his return to Spain, January 14th, 1493.
8. On their passage homeward, the adventurers encountered terrible storms, in one of which they were near being lost. In the moment
of the greatest danger, Columbus had presence of mind enough to
write, on parchment, a short account of his voyage, enclose it in a
cake of wax, and commit it to the sea in a cask, in hopes that if all
else should be lost, this might survive, and give information of his discoveries to the world. After seventy days, however, they arrived safe
in Spain.
9. A second voyage was made in the fall of 1493, during which,
Columbus discovered Jamaica and a few other islands. But now
unexpected difficulties occurred. Enemies thickened around him and
retarded his progress. It was not till the summer of 1498, that he
made his third voyage, during which he discovered the continent, to

CAPTURE OF BURIGOYNE.
CHAPTER CIV.
Capture of Burgoyne.
Surrender of Burgoyne.
1. AFTER the second battle of Stillwater, Burgoyne, with nis
troops, retreated to Saratoga. His army was exceedingly crippled,
having lost, in both engagements, from twelve hundred to fifteen
hundred men, and at least one valuable officer, General Frazer.
The Americans too had suffered, but not so severely; among others,
General Arnold had been wounded.
2. The object of Burgoyne, in retreating to Saratoga, was, most
clearly, to make his escape. To prevent this, General Gates posted
fourteen hundred men on the heights opposite the ford and at Saratoga, fifteen hundred at a ford higher up, and two thousand in the
rear, to prevent his retreat to Fort Edward.
3. His first attempt was to escape to Fort George, by way of Fort
Edward. Finding his path obstructed more than he had expected,
he set off in the night, but still found his way intercepted. About
the same time, moreover, news was received that Fort Edward had
fallen into the hands of the Americans.
4. Every door of escape now seemed closed, and hope fled.
Incessant toil and sickness, with much hard fighting, had worn down
his army to three thousand five hundred effective men, and even these
were almost destitute of provisions; while the American army was
daily increasing in numbers and courage. It is said that Burgoyne
had two thousand five hundred on the sick list.

5. In these circumstances, he called a council of war, at which it
was decided to surrender the army to General Gates. The preliminaries were soon settled, and the whole army, amounting to
five thousand seven hundred and fifty-two men, with five thousand
stands of arms, was given up to the Americans, on the 18th of October.
6. The capture of an entire army was, of course, a matter of much
exultation with the American people, as it more than compensated
for the reverses at and near Philadelphia. The thanks of congress
were voted to General Gates, and a gold medal was struck and presented to him by the president, in the name of the United States.
7. The surrender of Burgoyne was followed by the reduction of
several British posts in the north. Mount Defiance and Mount Hope
had even surrendered to General Lincoln, as early as September 13.
But Mount Independence and Ticonderoga gave up soon afterward.
An armed sloop was also taken, and two hundred and ninety prisoners.
8. Although Sir Henry Clinton, with his troops, had not been
able to proceed up the Hudson, to meet Bugoyne, yet he had done
that which might have encouraged the latter, had it been irn time.
He had taken several forts on and near the river above New York,
among which were Forts Clinton and Montgomery.
CHAPTER CV.
The War on the Ocean.
1. BEFORE the war of the revolution, the colonies had no navy
worthy of being mentioned. A few vessels fitted out to cruise for
pirates or to transport troops were all which could fairly be entitled
to the name. But as soon as the war was fairly begun, a navy began
to be thought of.
2. In October, 1775, congress ordered one vessel of ten guns and
another of fourteen to be equipped as national cruisers, and to be sent
to the eastward on a cruise of three months, to intercept supplies
designed for the royal troops. On the 30th of the same month, two
more vessels, one of thirty-six and the other of twenty guns, were
ordered.
3. In October, 1776, the Americans had five frigates of thirty-two
guns, five vessels of twenty-eight guns, and three of twenty-four, in
a course of building, and several were ready for sea. One twentyfour, one twenty, two sixteens, three fourteens, one twelve, two
tens, and two or three smaller vessels, were actually in the service.
Congress, at this time, ordered three seventy-fours, five frigates, and
two smaller vessels, to be built.

4. The Alfred, a twenty-four gun ship, was, as we have seen,
the largest in service. Of this vessel, Dudley Saltonstall was captain, and John Paul Jones first lieutenant. The first ensign ever
shown by a regular American man-of-war was hoisted on board the
Alfred, by Lieutenant Jones, in December, 1775.
Flag of the United States. -The stars and stripes.
5. What this ensign was, is not now known with certainty. The
present national colors were not adopted by congress till the year
1777. It is said, however, to have been a device representing a pine
tree, with a rattlesnake, about to strike, coiled at its root, with the
mnotto, " Don't tread on me."
6. The first regular cruisers ever got to sea under the new government, were the Hornet, of ten guns, and the Wasp, of eight.  The
first battle fought was off the Bermudas, April 6, 1776, between the
Alfred and Cabot on the American side, and the British ship Glasgow, of twenty guns. The Americans fought well, but the enemy
escaped them.
7. On the 17th of the same month, the Lexington, of sixteen guns,
commanded by Captain Barry, fell in with the Edward, an armed
tender of the ship Liverpool, and, after a close and spirited action, of
near an hour, captured her. The Lexington had four men killed and
wounded, while the Edward was nearly cut to pieces. These battles
gave the people great hope.

CHAPTER CVI.
Exploits of Paul Jones.
1. JOHN PAUL JONES, or, as he was commonly called, Paul Jones,
was transferred, in May, 1776, from the Alfred to the commnand of
the Providence, a vessel mounting twelve guns, and having on board
seventy men. In this, he made sixteen prizes in little more than
three weeks. He was also twice chased by British men-of-war, but
escaped by stratagem and superior sailing.
2. In 1777, while the British were taking possession of Philadelphia, and Gates was spreading a net for Burgoyne, Paul Jones was
in France, endeavoring, through the influence of the American commissioners, Franklin, Deane, and Lee, to get the command of a
larger and better vessel than any the Americans had in the service.
3. Unwilling, however, to be long idle, he sailed on a cruise, in
April, 1778, in the Ranger, of eighteen guns. With this single little
vessel he kept the whole coast of Scotland, and part of that of
England, for some time, in a state of alarm. He even made a
descent, in one instance, upon Whitehaven, and surprised and took
two forts with thirty pieces of cannon, and set fire to the shipping.
4. In the vicinity of Whitehaven, an act was committed which
Jones very much regretted, and did all he could afterward to atone
for. The house of the Earl of Selkirk, in whose service Jones'

father had been gardener, was robbed of its family plate. It was
returned to Lady Selkirk, with a letter of apology and regret.
5. In May, not long after the descent on Whitehaven, he was
engaged with the British sloop of war Drakle, a vessel equal in size
and strength and the number of its men to the Ranger, which, after
a smart action of about an hour, was captured. Soon after this event,
he sailed for Brest, in France, carrying in with him, it is said, two
hundred prisoners.
6. But the most remarkable exploit of Jones remains to be mentioned. In the spring of 1779, with the aid of Dr. Franklin, who
was then in France, he got the command of a little squadron of five
vessels, of which the Bon Homme Richard, his own vessel of fortytwo guns, was the largest.
7. With this little fleet, he set sail, June 19, and, after a cruise of
a few weeks, returned. Two more small vessels were now added to
his squadron, and he sailed again on the 14th of August. On the
23d of September, after a most desperate battle, he captured the
British ship of war, Serapis, of forty-four guns and a full complement
of men; but not without the loss of nearly a hundred men in killed
and wounded.
8. This was considered as one of the most remarkable feats of the
revolutionary war. It raised the reputation of Jones, as a naval
commander, to the highest pitch, both in Europe and America.
The king of France presented him with a gold sword. Congress
also praised his zeal, prudence and intrepidity, and voted him a gold
medal.
9. But, though a bold commander, and as skilful and successful as
bold, Jones never knew how to command himself, nor to submit to
the command of others. He was irritable, impatient and impetuous,
and harsh in his mode of government. So true is it that they only
know how to govern well, who have first learned to obey.
10. Jones continued in the war till near its close, and was afterwards in the service of the Empress of Russia. But he did not succeed well, and he finally became indigent, neglected and diseasedthe consequence of his own want of moral and religious principles,nd good physical habits. He died at Paris in 1792.

of the city and the adjacent places till some time in October, when
a part of their troops were detached to assist General Howe and the
fleet in reducing some forts on the Delaware below the city-the
remainder continuing in Germantown.
2. Washington, who well knew that the eyes of the country were
upon him, seized this very opportunity for attacking them. His
forces could not have amounted to more than ten thousand men, and
many of them were poorly armed and equipped, one thousand of them
actually barefooted, and not a few actually sick. Yet, under all these
disadvantageous circumstances, it was thought necessary to hazard a
battle.
3. At seven o'clock in the evening of October 3, the troops set out
for Germantown. The distance was fourteen miles. They marched
as rapidly as possible, in order, if possible, to take the enemy by surprise. The plan was well contrived and well executed, and the
surprise of the British was complete. The attack was made between
daybreak and sunrise on the morning of the 4th.
4. At first the British were repulsed at several points, and from
one hundred to one hundred and twenty prisoners taken. But after
the battle had lasted about three hours, the ammunition of the Americans in part failed. Nor was this the worst. A thick fog came on,
and it was so dark that they could hardly distinguish friend from foe,
and while the British were retreating in disorder, the Americans
also, by some means, took to flight, and were in the end completely
routed.
5. Several amusing anecdotes are related of this bloody battle.
One division of the army was commanded, it seems, by General
Greene, whose aid-de-camp, Major Burnet, wore his hair in a cue.
In the heat of the battle, this cue was shorn off by a musket ball,
which General Greene perceiving, said, "Don't be in haste, major;
just dismount and get that long cue." The major dismounted and
recovered the hair.
6. Not many minutes afterward, another shot came whizzing so
close to General Greene, as to take from his head a large powdered
curl. The British, at this moment, were hotly pursuing them.
"Don't be in a hurry, general," said Major Burnet; "dismount and
get your curl." The general, however, did not venture to follow his
advice.,. After the battle, Washington resumed his former position, but
in a few days removed to Whitemarsh, a few miles nearer Philadelphia. The British, on their part, left Germantown and retired to
the city. Both armies appeared to have gained confidence by this
engagement, notwithstanding the well known fact, that both were
most severely injured.

Donop, to attack a small fort which the Americans had erected on

retire from the attack, with the loss of their brave commander and
four hundred men.
CHAPTER CVIII.
Treaty with France.
1. DURING the session of congress for the year 1777, the confederation of the colonies, which had been attempted the year before, was
again under discussion, but it had not yet been ratified by the states.
By one of the articles the name given to the confederacy was "The
United States of America."
2. One prominent article of the confederation fixed a line of distinction between the powers of the several states and congress, in
order to prevent collisions. To this end, the articles were very
specific, and they appear to have been, in many respects, adapted to
the existing condition of the country.
3. This year, also, congress adopted a national flag. The resolution was in these words: "Resolved, that the flag of the thirteen
United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the
union be thirteen stars, in a blue field, representing a new constellation."
4. For nearly a year before the surrender of Burgoyne, three cornCVIII.-1. What was done by congress in 1777? 2. What was a prominent article

missioners from congress, Dr. Franklin, Silas Dean and Arthur Lee,
had been urging France to acknowledge the independence of the
United Colonies. When intelligence was received in Paris of that
important event, the solicitations of the commissioners were renewed,
anid finally with success.
5. A treaty of alliance and commerce, between the two nations,
was signed February 6, 1778. By the treaty, neither of the two
powers was to make war or peace without the formal consent of the
other. This alliance with France, with the previous and subsequent
assistance of La Fayette, proved, in the end, of the highest importance to the United States.
6. A treaty of peace was also made during the year 1777, between
the states of South Carolina and Georgia and the Cherokee Indians.
This was another highly important measure to both parties. By this
treaty, the Cherokees ceded to South Carolina more than three millions of acres of their lands.
7. At the close of this eventful year, Washington and his army
retired, for winter quarters, to Valley Forge, twenty miles from Philadelphia. On the 18th of December, they began to build huts.
These were sixteen by fourteen feet, and were made to accommodate
twelve men each. They were so numerous that when the encampment was completed, it had the appearance of a town, with streets
and avenues.
8. Troops from each particular state had their quarters together,
in this temporary village of log huts, and here they suffered together.
For though their situation was more comfortable than it might have
been, yet thousands had no blankets, and were obliged to spend the
most severe nights in trying to get warm, rather than in sleeping.
They also suffered greatly, at times, for want of food.
CHAPTER CIX.
Evacuation of Philadelphia and Battle of Monmouth.
1. THE British kept possession of Philadelphia this winter and the
following spring; and, although Washington's camp was within three
or four hours' march of the city, no attempt was made to molest him.
Foraging parties went up, it is true, and committed depredations, but
they sometimes suffered severely for their temerity.
2. The British troops in the United States were now about thirtythree thousand, of whom nineteen thousand five hundred were at
Philadelphia, ten thousand five hundred in New York, and three
thousand in Rhode Island. The American army did not exceed
fifteen thousand; of whom more than eleven thousand were at Valley
commissioners? 5. What treaty of alliance wvas signed in 1778? 6. What other treaty

Forge. Congress had, indeed, resolved on raising forty thousand
new troops  but the resolution had not yet been carried into effect.
3. About the first of May, Washington called a council of war, on
the subject of attacking the British in Philadelphia. Such a measure
was at length decided to be inexpedient.  The wisdom of this decision
was soon evident; for it was found that they had not only greatly
underrated the numbers of the British, but that they were about to
leave the city of their own accord.
4. On the 18th of June, 1778, the British evacuated Philadelphia,
and marched through New Jersey towards New York. On the 28th,
when they had advanced as far as Monmouth court-house, sixty-four
miles from Philadelphia, they found themselves attacked by the army,
under the command of Generals Charles Lee, Greene, La Fayette,
Scott, Wayne, and Washington himself.
5. In the beginning of the attack, the American army was thrown
into confusion by the sudden, unexpected and unnecessary retreat of
General Lee, from a post which had been assigned him. But, by
the exertions of Washington and his able coadjutors, order was again
restored, and the battle vigorously sustained till dark, when it was
resolved by the Americans to suspend their operationg till next
morning.
6. They lay on their arms all night, in the field of battle. Even
Washington slept in his cloak, under a tree, in the midst of his
soldiers, determined to renew the battle at the returning dawn of day.
In the mean time, however, the British disappeared, and with so much
silence, that their departure had not been suspected.
7. In this battle of Monmouth, both parties, as they had often done
before, claimed the victory; yet both were very great sufferers. The
American had about seventy killed and one hundred and sixty wounded.
The British lost, in killed, wounded, and prisoners, three hundred
and fifty-eight. During this day, and on their previous march, one
thousand more had also deserted them.
8. Among the slain, of the British, was Colonel Monckton, a most
valuable officer, and one greatly beloved. It is said by the British
historians, that, in the- midst of the confusion and danger of the battle,
the troops dug a grave for him with their bayonets, and "placed over
him, with their hands, the earth they had first moistened with their
tears."
9. The day of the battle was excessively hot-one of the hottest
ever known in the month of June. Fifty-nine of the British soldiers,

loading and firing a cannon, the husband was suddenly killed before
her eyes. An officer came along and ordered the vacant cannon to be
put out of the way. To his great astonishment, however, Molly took

as a rewvrard, gave her half-pay for life.
11. This is not the only instance of female patriotism which
occurred during the war of the revolution. Not long after the battle
of Lexington, the females of Bristol county, Pennsylvania, resolved
to raise and equip a whole regiment of soldiers at their own expense,
and even to arm such as were unable to arm themselves. One of
their number presented the colors their own hands had wrought, and
made an eloquent address.
CHAPTER CX.
Character of General Charles Lee.
1. GENERAL LEE was very much blamed by Washington, for his
conduct in the battle of MAonmouth, not only at the time, but afterward. Indeed, he was tried by a court martial, who found him gulilty
of disobeying orders, misbehaving before the enemy, and treating
Washington, his commander-in-chief, with disrespect. His sentence
was suspension from the army for one year.
2. General Charles Lee was born in North Wales, and became

which he had been the first to open a pathway. Even then, being
charged with misconduct, he was carried home in irons.
10. Columbus was, however, liberated, and made a fourth voyage
to America, in 1502, with his brother Bartholomew and his son Ferdinand; but it was his last. The same enmity which had caused him
to be sent home from his third voyage in fetters still raged, and he
at last became its victim. After languishing in obscurity and poverty
for a time, he died at Valladolid, in Spain, May 30th, 1507, in the
seventieth year of his age.
11. The new continent, on every just principle, should have been
called Columbia, after its first discoverer. But Americus Vespucius,
a Florentine, who visited the continent in 1499, and published a map
of the coast, contrived to have it called by his own name.
CHAPTER VIII.
Otzer discoveries in America.
1. THE fame of what Columbus had done was soon spread through
Europe, and adventurers flocked to the New World - some for honor,
some for enterprise, and others for gain. In general, however, the
great object of pursuit was gold and other precious commodities, as
will become more evident in the progress of our history.
2. Two Englishmen, John Cabot, and Sebastian, his son, were the
first discoverers of the continent of America. They sailed in May,
1497, under the patronage of Henry VII., of England. They saw
the continent a year sooner than Columbus, and two years before
Americus Vespucius. In this and subsequent voyages, they also discovered the islands of Newfoundland and St. John, and coasted as far
south as Virginia, claiming the country in behalf of the king of
England, by virtue of these discoveries.
3. In 1501, the king of Portugal sent out a fleet of discovery under
the command of Gaspar Cortereal. He sailed along the shores of
North America six or seven hundred miles; but he appears to have
thought more of money than anything else; and not findiffng gold, he
seized on fifty of the native Indians, carried them home, and sold them
as,slaves.
4. Emboldened by his success, he made a second voyage, but did
not live to return. The general belief is that he lost his life in
attempting to secure another cargo of slaves; and that Labrador was
the theatre of his crime and its punishment. This, however, is not
quite certain.

an officer, as it is said, at the age of eleven years. He served early
in America, and was with General Abercrombie, at his unsuccessful
assault on Ticonderoga, where he was wounded. At a period
still later than this, he served under General Burgoyne, in Por.
tugal.
3. When the quarrel began to arise between Great Britain and
America, Lee was on the side of the colonies, and wrote in their
favor. After this, he spent several years wandering over Europe,
until about the year 1774, when, having killed an Italian officer in a
duel, he was obliged to fly. Coming to New York, congress made
him at once a major general.
4. In December, 1776, while marching through New Jersey to
join Washington, as he lay carelessly at a considerable distance from
the main body of the army, he was seized by the British, put on
horseback, and carried to New York. He was kept a prisoner by the
British, and sometimes very ill-treated, till the surrender of Burgoyne,
when he was exchanged.
5. His suspension from the army, for a year, for his misconduct at
Monmouth, finished his career as a military man. He might indeed
have again engaged in the war at the end of the time, had he been a
trune patriot, but such he seems not to have been. He wrote a pamphlet, in which, besides defending his own conduct, he took it upon
himself to abuse Washington.
6. There is little doubt that Lee, who was proud, selfish and
ambitious, envied Washington, and secretly sought to diminish his
influence, in order to elevate himself. Yet he was, for the most part,
a good military officer, as well as a fine scholar, and few men in the
army had more capacity than he.
7. His abuse of Washington led to a duel with Colonel Laurens,
in which he received a wound. After this he retired to his estate in
Virginia, where he lived alone, in a miserable hovel, without windows
or plastering, amusing himself with his books and his dogs. He died
at a public house, in Philadelphia, in the year 1782.
CHAPTER CXI.
The War in Rhode Island.
1. ON the first of July, 1778, the very day on which the British
troops, in their retreat from Philadelphia, reached New York, Count
D'Estaing, from France, with twelve ships of the line, six frigates,
and four thousand men, arrived off the coast of the United States, in
the hope of attacking the British fleet in the Delaware river, or the
Chesapeake Bay.
4. What happened to him in 1776? 5. How did he behave on his suspension from the
army? 6. What is supposed to have actuated him in abusing Washington? 7. What

CXLi 1. What of Count D'Estaing  2. Where did he sail, and for what purpose?
200TEHE WAR IN RHODE ISLAND.
2. But he was a little too late to engage them at the south, for
they had just gone to New York. By the advice of Washington, he
sailed to the north, to assist in a plan which had been formed for
expelling the British from Rhode Island. He arrived, with his fleet,
at Newport, July 25.
3. In the mean time, the American army, to the number of ten
thousand men, under Generals Sullivan and Greene, had been collected together at or near Providence. Here General Sullivan and
Count D'Estaing laid a plan together, to take Newport; but, just
before they were ready for the onset, a British fleet appeared in
sight, and D'Estaing sailed out to make an attack.
4. A violent storm came on, which scattered both fleets, and so
crippled the French as to prevent an engagement. Meanwhile,
General Sullivan, in expectation of the arrival of the French
fleet, and unable to wait longer, crossed, on the 9th of August,
to Rhode Island, with nine thousand men, and, on the 14th, besieged
Newport.
5. The French fleet at length made its appearance, but, instead
of coming to the aid of General Sullivan, sailed to Boston, to refit.
This was a sad disappointment to the Americans, and General
Sullivan found it expedient, on the 28th of August, to raise the
siege, and retire to his first position, at the north end of the
island.
6. The British troops, about six thousand strong, taking advantage of his retreat, went out against him the next day, and a long
and severe battle ensued. The British, after having lost about two
hundred and sixty men, retreated. The American loss was considerable, but not so great as that of the British.
7. The next day, a brisk cannonading was kept up on both sides,
but there was no sharp conflict. At this juncture, General Sullivan
received a letter from Washington, informing him that a large
body of troops had just set out from New York, probably for the
relief of Newport; upon which, it was determined to retreat from the
island.
8. The retreat was conducted with great skill, and was accomplished during the night of the 30th of August. It was, most
undoubtedly, a lucky escape; for Sir Henry Clinton, with four
thousand men, arrived next day, and a little longer stay on the
island would probably have been fatal. General Sullivan's troops
were chiefly raw recruits and militia, not yet inured to the business
of war.
9. The British troops from New York, not being wanted at
Rhode Island, proceeded along the coast of Massachusetts to New
Bedford and Martha's Vineyard. Their avowed object was to seize
the American privateers, which were known to be in the habit of

resorting to New Bedford; but they did not scruple to burn stores,
houses, mills, barns, &amp;c. At Fair Haven they received a repulse
and were glad to retreat.
CHAPTER CXII.
Trumbull, the Painter.
1. ONE excellent young officer, who was very active in the American army, under General Sullivan, during this period of the war in
Rhode Island, deserves something more than a mere passing notice.
The person referred to was Major John Trumbull, of Connecticut;
afterwards Colonel Trumbull, the celebrated painter.
2. Colonel Trumbull was first introduced to the army as an adjutant of militia, under General Spencer, of Connecticut, a relation of
Governor Trumbull, his father. It was soon after the battle of
Lexington. The regiment to which he belonged, being attached
to General Thomas' division of the army, was stationed at Roxbury.
3. Here they were sometimes annoyed by the fire of the enemy,
especially on the day of the battle of Bunker's Hill. Hearing the
firing that day, General Spencer's regiment was drawn up in full
view of the British troops, posted on the "Neck;" upon which the
latter opened a fire on them. Most of the balls passed over their
heads; one of them, however, came so near a soldier, standing by
Trumbull, that, without being touched by it, he fell.
CXII.- 1. What of John Trumbull? 2. How was he first introduced? Where was
he staLioned? 3. Describe the situation of the troops on the neck. 4. What of theTRUMBULL, THE PAINTER.
4. Trumbull thought the soldier was only frightented, and bade
tnim get up; but he said he was not able, and that he should die. The
soldiers took him to the surgeon, but there was no wound, nor the
slightest bruise. But he died. The heart and large vessels near it
were full of thick, dark blood. He was evidently killed by the force
-the wind, as it is called- of the ball.
5. Soon after this, Washington was desirous of obtaining a correct plan of the enemy's works about the "Neck."    As Colonel
Trumbull was known to be apt at drawing, a brother of his, in the
army, advised him to take this opportunity of introducing himself to
the favorable notice of the American commander; and he profited by
the suggestion.
6. By creeping along, under cover of the fences and high grass, he
could approach so near as to sketch their works with a good deal of
accuracy. A British deserter came into camp about this time, and
gave Washington the desired information; but Trumbull's drawings
were also consulted, and found to agree with the soldier's story.
Colonel Trumbull was, soon after this, made Washington's second
aid-de-camp.
7. On going to New    York with Washington, soon after the
British left Boston, he accepted the office of adjutant, with the rank
of colonel, to General Gates, at the north, and was with him till
after the surrender of Burgoyne. His services in the army were
greatly enhanced by his skill in drawing, and were appreciated by the
officers and the public.
8. After this he was a short time with Washington again, not
long after his success at Trenton; but was soon sent out with General
Arnold to Rhode Island. He was there till March, 1777, when he
left the army, and returned to his father's, at Lebanon, Connecticut,
Some time in the course of the year, he went to Boston, to perfect
himself in the art of painting.
9. When the Americans began to plan an attack on Newport,
Colonel Trumbull left Boston, and again entered the army as a volunteer aid to General Sullivan. After the army had crossed over to the
north end of Rhode Island, and was skirmishing with the enemy, he
was employed more than once in the most dangerous services;
which, however, he performed with the greatest boldness and faithfulness.
10. One day, when the skirmishing had begun early in the morning, and Trumbull, in the discharge of his duty, was carrying an
order to one of the officers, the wind blew off his hat. As he did not
think it safe to dismount for the sake of a hat, he tied a white handkerchief round his head, and wore it all day.
11. "Being moun-ted," says he, "on a superb bay horse, in a
summer dress of nankeen, with this head-dress, never was aid-decamnp exposed more to danger than I was, during that entire day,

from daylight to dusk." Yet he escaped without the slightest
injury. "I thank thee," he adds, " O, thou, Most High, for thou
hast covered mny head in the day of battle!"
12. This interesting young man left the army again, immediately
after General Sullivan's retreat, and returned to Connecticut. One
more anecdote concerning hirn will be given in connection with the
account of the capture and execution of Major Andre.
CHAPTER CXIII.
Massacre at Wyoming.
1. THE savages on the frontier, during the year 1778, were exceedingly troublesome. There was a beautiful settlement on the
eastern branch of the Susquehannah river, comprising four townships,
each five miles square, and so thickly peopled that, according to some
statements, it had already furnished one thousand men to the continental army.
2. This district of Wyoming was settled by Connecticut people,
who carried with them their industrious habits, and were very prosperous and happy. They lived in the shade of their own forest trees
in summer; and in winter, by their own brighlt and warm firesides.
Their barns were filled with grain and corn, and their green pastures,
by the river banks, were spotted with sheep.
3. Excited, as it is supposed, by the tories, the Indians fixed an
evil eye on these settlers; but, to prevent suspicion, first sent messages of peace and friendship. Suspicion, however, was now raised,
and the settlers applied to Washington for an armed force, to protect
them; but it was too late. Early in July, four hundred Indians, with
more than twice that number of tories and half-blood Englishmen,
came upon the settlement and destroyed it.
4. They were headed by Brandt, a cruel half-breed Indian, and
John Butler, a tory. The officers only were dressed in British uniform; the rest were all painted and dressed like the Indians. The
colonists, in their apprehension of what might happen, had built a few
small forts, and gathered their families and some of their effects into
them.
5. The savages and savage-looking whites now appeared before
one of the forts, which was commanded by a cousin of Butler, and
demanded its surrender. They persuaded its commander to come out
to a spot agreed upon, in the woods, for the purpose, as they said, of
making peace. He accordingly marched to the spot with four hundred men; but not an Indian or a tory was to be found there.
6. They pressed on through the dark paths of the forest, but still

no one was to be found. At last they saw themselves suddenly
surrounded by the enemy. The savages were in every bush, and
sprang out upon them with terrible yells. All but sixty of these four
hundred men were murdered in the most cruel manner.
7. The enemy now went back to Kingston, the village, and, to
strike the people with as much horror as they could, hurled over the
gates to them the reeking scalps of their brothers, husbands and
fathers. The distressed people now inquired of Butler, the leader
of the tories, what terms he would give them. He answered only
- " the hatchet."
8. They fought as long as possible, but the enemy soon enclosed
the fort with dry wood, and set it on fire. The unhappy people
within-men, women, and children - all perished in the fearful
blaze. The whole country was then ravaged, and all the inhabitants
who could be found were scalped; the houses, crops, and orchards
were burned; and even the tongues of the domestic animals were
cut out, and the poor creatures left to perish.
9. This was one of those bloody deeds which the Indians are so
apt to perpetrate, especially when led on by designing white men.
The same company of Wyoming murderers committed other acts of
violence than those above related. They were, however, at length
invaded and humbled, and made willing to remain at peace on almost
any terms.
10. After the treaty, the petty chiefs of the New York and Penn.
sylvania Indians occasionally came to the camp to see Washington,
whom they called their Great Father. Washington, in showing them
his army, rode before them on his own fine gray war-horse, while
they followed on miserable horses, without saddles and almost without bridles, and wore nothing but dirty blankets.
CHAPTER CXIV.
The War in Georgia.
1. THERE was little hard fighting, this year, between the regulal
troops of the two great contending armies, except what has been
mentioned. The only additional movements, worthy of notice, were
the invasion of Georgia from two very different points -Florida and
New York.
2. During the summer, two parties of British regulars and American refugees made a sudden and rapid incursion from Florida into
Georgia. One of the parties, advancing to a fort in Sunbury, summoned it to surrender; but, on receiving from the commander the
laconic answer, "Come and take it," they abandoned the enterprise.

205THE WAR IN GEORGIA.
3. The other party went towards Savannah, but, after meeting
with many attacks from the militia as they passed along, and hearing
of the failure of the other party, they returned. In their return, they
burned the church and nearly every house in the village of Medway,
and carried off the slaves, cattle and other property.
4. This was followed by an expedition from Georgia and South
Carolina, of two thousand men, chiefly militia, into Florida. They
proceeded to a fort on the river St. Mary's, which they destroyed,
and then, after some skirmishing, advanced towards St. Augustine.
But a mortal sickness having attacked the troops and swept away one
fourth of them, the survivors returned.
5. The second invasion of Georgia was undertaken much later
in the season than the former. On the 27th of November, Colonel
Campbell, with two thousand British troops, left New York, and,
in three weeks, landed at the mouth of the Savannah river. Near
Savannah, were six hundred regular American troops and a few militia.
6. The British, being about to make an attack, were shown, by a
negro, a private path leading to the rear of the American forces, of
which they availed themselves. The latter, finding the enemy both
in their front and rear, attempted to fly, but were mostly taken or
slain, and the fort and town of Savannah fell into British hands.
7. The victory at Savannah was followed up as closely as possible
by the British troops, and the fort at Sunbury soon surrendered to
them and the Florida forces. The combined troops of New York and
St. Augustine now held, and for some time continued to hold, possession of the state.
8. Such of the Americans as had been taken prisoners, during the
war between Britain and the United States, and had not yet been
exchanged, were kept in prison-ships, in New York and elsewhlere,
and in jails in England. Those in prison-ships often suffered extremely, and many died of their sufferings and by disease. Great and
just complaint, in regard to their treatment, was made both at home
and abroad.
9. Just at the close of the year 1778, a meeting was held in London
for the relief of the American prisoners confined in British jails, of
which there were about one thousand. Subscriptions were opened,
both in London and the country. By January 10, 1779, the subscriptions amounted to three thousand eight hundred and fifteen pounds
seventeen shillings and sixpence, or nearly nineteen thousand dollars.
These proceedings, on the part of the people of the hostile country,
are sufficient evidences of the inhumanity suffered by the American
prisoners.

CHAPTER CXV.
The British at Charleston.
1. NEAR the close of 1778, General Lincoln had been appointed to
take the command of the army at the south. He was an excellent
officcr; and having been next in command to General Gates, in the
movements against Burgoyne in the north, was there active, faithful
and successful in all his operations.
2. Very early in the year 1779, he proceeded to the post assigned
him. As Georgia was now overrun by the British troops, he took
his stand on the northern side of the Savannah river. Soon after
his arrival, a detachment of fifteen hundred North Carolina militia
and sixty regular troops, under General Ash, having crossed the
river, were defeated by General Prevost with great loss.
3. But General Lincoln, nothing daunted, marched his army
towards Augusta, the head quarters of General Prevost. His whole
forces now amounted to five thousand. General Prevost, withl twentyfour hundred men, left Augusta, about the same time, for Charleston.
As Lincoln supposed this to be a feint to draw him from his design,
he continued his march.
4. When the British were about half way from Augusta to
Charleston they halted two or three days, which gave time for
putting the latter in a state of defence. All the houses in the
suburbs were burnt, cannon were placed around the city at proper

intervals, and a force of three thousand three hundred men were
assembled for its defence.
5. The enemy reached the city and summoned it to surrender on
the 12th of May. The inhabitants contrived to spend the day in
parleying, before they gave an answer, that they might gain time.
When, however, they were told that if they surrendered, it must be
as prisoners of war, the negotiation terminated, and they prepared
for an assault.
6. To their surprise, however, no attack was made, and the British,
during the following night, withdrew their forces, and, crossing
Ashley Ferry, encamped near the sea. General Lincoln soon arrived,
and stationed his forces near Charleston, unwilling to risk a general
battle if he could help it.
7. However, he was not disposed to be idle, and learning the weak
state of a British fort at Stone Ferry, he advanced against it with
twelve hundred men. The Americans had the advantage in the fight,
though they thought it necessary to retreat soon afterward. General
Prevost, about the same time, left the vicinity of Charleston, and
his main army retreated to Savannah.
CHAPTER CXVI.
American Attack on Savannah.
1. COUNT D'ESTAING, after his fleet had refitted in Boston, sailed
for the West Indies, where he remained till the next summer. He
arrived on the coast of Georgia so unexpectedly to the British, that,
before they were ready to meet him, he had captured one man of war
of fifty guns, and three frigates.
2. General Lincoln had long expected him, and when it was
known that he had arrived, he marched with his regular troops and
a considerable body of Carolina and Georgia militia to Savannah.
Before he arrived, however, D'Estaing was there, and had summoned
the place to surrender.
3. General Prevost, on receiving the summons, asked for a day
to consider it, which was granted. In the mean time, however,
receiviniig a reinforcement of eight hundred men, his courage was so
much increased that he determined to defend himself to the last.
4. On the morning of October 4, the American and French forces
laid siege to the place, and, on the 9th, a direct assault was made,
which was repulsed. The invaders rallied, and a desperate battle
was kept up for some time, when the French and Americans were
obliged to retire with a very heavy loss. Of the former, six hundred

and thirty-seven were killed or wounded; of the latteI, two hundred
and forty-one.
5. Count Pulaski, the Polish nobleman, was wounded in the battle,
and soon afterward died. He was a brave man. He was one of
those who carried off King Stanislaus from his capital, and who, in
consequence of this act, after the king made his escape, were proscribed as outlaws. Congress ordered a monument to be erected to
his memory.
6. The attack on Savannah was doubtless ill-judged and premature.
It was hastened on by D'Estaing. Had the siege been conducted
more slowly it might have been successful. After the siege was
raised, nearly all the American troops went to their homes, and D'Estaing reembarked and sailed for Europe.
CHAPTER CXVII.
The War in Connecticut. - General Putnam.
1. THE northern department of the American army had chiefly
wintered near the Hudson- some on the New Jersey side, and some
on the other. Two brigades were as high up as West Point.
Three brigades were also quartered near Danbury, in Connecticut.
2. Thus arranged with regard to New York, they could not only
watch the movements of the enemy, but keep up a communication
with each other, and be able to act in concert, should it be necessary.
General McDougall commanded in the Highlands, and General Putnam
at Danbury. The British forces in New York were commanded by
General Clinton.
3. In the spring of 1779, a British force was sent to ravage the
coasts of Virginia. They destroyed everything in their wayvillages, shipping, and stores. They also seized on large quantities
of tobacco. Being asked by the Virginians what sort of a war this
was, their general replied, that "all rebels must be so treated."
4. Indeed, it seemed to be a leading object with the British, this
year, to distress and impoverish the Americans as much as they could,
in order, as they themselves said, "to render the colonies of as little
use as possible to each other in their new connections."  They plundered, consumed, and destroyed as much as they could, both at the
north and at the south.
5. A month or two after the foregoing ravages were committed
in Virginia, General Tryon was sent out to make similar ravages on
the coast of Connecticut. In expectation of an attack, the militia of

the St. Lawrence, and the islands of Newfoundland and Cape Breton.
By the year 1505 or 1506, they were quite familiar with this region,
and Denys, of Honfleur, had drawn a map of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
6. As early as 1508, the French had become much engaged in the
fisheries on the north-east coast of the present United States, and, as
if to follow up the wicked example of the Portuguese, and involve the
first settlers in cruel wars, had forcibly carried away to France some
of the natives. They appear also to have meditated the establishment
of colonies in the New World.
CHAPTER IX.
Discoveries in North America.
Death of Ponce de Leon.
1. ONE of the most remarkable voyages of discovery was made in
1524. Francis I., king of France, sent oult to America one Verrazani, a Florentine, who, with a singie vessel, the Dolhbin, a~ftr a
long voyage of fiftvy Jlays, in whic}i  U' ecountered a terrible storm,
reached North Carolina; thence, sai,ing1 northward, he explored the
coasts of New  Jersey, Rhode Island l?iassachusetts,  Maine, and
Nova Scotia, and returned to France. He also paid some attention to
the coasts of Florida.
2. In 1534, the samie king sent James Cartier to the Gulf of St.
Lawrence and Newfoundland. In a second voyage, this navigator
sailed up the St. Lawrence as far as Montreal, to which he gave its
present name. He learned from the Indians something of northern

Fairfield were mustered and in arms. Tryon came to the spot,
ordered them to surrender, and gave them an hour to consider his
proposal; but, in the mean time, laid most of the town in ashes.
6. At New Haven, all possible damage was done. The harbor
was covered with feathers poured out from beds. Desks, trunks,
chests and closets were broken open; the women were robbed of
their buckles, rings, bonnets and aprons. East Haven was afterwards
burnt, and Norwalk shared a similar fate.
7. Near Stamford, the British, with some fifteen hundred men,
came suddenly upon General Putnam, who had no other means of
defence than one hundred and fifty militia and two pieces of cannon.
But with these alone, this brave officer was almost a match for them
for some time. At last, however, he ordered his men to retreat to a
neighboring swamp.
8. For himself, being hard pressed, he rode at filll gallop down a
steep rock. Nearly one hundred steps had been hewn in it, like a
flight of stairs, for the people to ascend in going to church. The
cavalry, who were pursuing him, stopped at the brink and discharged
their pistols, but dared not follow him. He escaped with a bullethole through his hat.
9. This year, also, in July, a fleet of thirty-seven small vessels and
fifteen hundred militia, under Generals Wadsworth and Lowell, was
fitted out from Boston to drive the British from the Penobscot river,
in Maine, where they had collected and built a fort. It was at a
place called Bagaduce, now Castinre. The expedition did not succeed.
CHAPTER CXVIII.
Anecdote of La Fayette.
1. AN anecdote of La Fayette, which belongs to this year, deserves
to be preserved in connection with the history of the United States.
He had intended to make a visit to France towards the close of the
year 1778, but had been detained several months by sickness. Again
he was detained a while longer at Boston, to wait for the frigate
Alliance to be got ready, in which he was to sail.
2. The government of Massachusetts offered to complete the numnber of men which was necessary to man the Alliance, by impressment - a measure that had been sometimes resorted to during the
war; but La Fayette was too benevolent to permit this. At last, the
crew was made up by other and more merciful means.

3. The Somnerset, a sixty-four gun ship, had been wrecked on the
coast of New England, and part of her men had found their way to
Boston. Some of these men offered to go in the Alliance. There
were volunteers, also, from among the prisoners. Added to these
were a few French seamen.
La Fayette.
4. Wit,t this motley crew, English, French and American, and
strangers in great part to each other and to the ship, La Fayette, in
simple but unwise confidence, trusted himself, and the vessel sailed
the 11th of January. They had a tempestuous passage, but nothing
happened worth relating till they were within two days' sail of the
English coast.
5. Here a conspiracy was formed by the English part of the crew,
amounting to seventy or eighty men, to kill the officers, seize the
vessel, and take it into an English port. The British government had
in fact passed a law, some time before this, to encourage acts of mutiny, by the offer of a reward to all such crews as would run away
with American ships.
6. The intentions of the conspirators appear to have been as bloody
as they could be. The work of death was to have been begun precisely at four o'clock of the afternoon of February 2. The signal to
begin the work was the cry of " Sail-ho!" which it was well known
would bring the officers and passengers upon the quarter deck, where
they could be seized in a body.
7. The captain was to have been put into a boat, without food,
water, oars or sails, heavily ironed, and turned loose upon the ocean.

spot. The marine officer and surgeon were to have been hanged and
quartered, and their bodies cast into the sea.
8. The sailing master was to have been cut into morsels and
thrown overboard. The lieutenants were to have had their choice,
either to navigate the vessel to the nearest British port, or to walk
overboard. The passengers were to have been confined and carried
into England as prisoners of war.
9. Among the crew was an- excellent young man, whom the
mutineers took, from his accent, to be an Irishman, but who had
become, in fact, an American.  They had proposed their plan to
him, and he had learned their whole secret. About an hour before
the massacre was to have taken place, he revealed the plot to
La Fayette and the captain, who immediately took measures to prevent it.
10. The officers and passengers were informed what was going
on, as well as such other men as could be trusted. A few minutes
before four o'clock, the officers, passengers, and American seamen
rushed on deck, with drawn swords and other weapons, and thirty or
forty of the mutineers were seized and put in irons. The crime was
confessed, the mutineers were secured, and the ship soon arrived at
Brest, in France. It was proposed to punish them; but the nobleminded La Fayette insisted on exchanging them as mere prisoners of
war.
CHAPTER CXIX.
The Continental Money.
1. THE year 1779 was less distinguished for splendid or brilliant
achievements by either of the two great contending nations, than any
year had been since the commencement of the war; and this, too,
notwithistanding the alliance of the United States with France. One
cause of this, among many others, was the troubles which now began
to be experienced this year about paper money.
2. The history of money, in connection with these states, is quite
curious. Going back to 1643, we find the general court of Massachusetts ordering that wampumpeog, or the Indian wampum, should
pass current in the payment of debts, to the amount of forty shillings,
except taxes; the white wampumpeog at eight for a penny, the black
at four.
3. The first mint for coining money in New England was erected
in 1652. The money coined was shillings, sixpences and threewas to have been done with the officers of the ship? What was to have been the fate

pences. The law ordered that they should have Massachusetts and a
tree on one side, and New England and the value of the coin on the
other. This currency continued not only to be used but to be coined,
for thirty years or more.
4. Bills of credit, or paper money, appear to have been issued
by Carolina, in the year 1706. Soon after the emission, the value
of the money fell one third; one hundred and fifty pounds of Carolina currency being worth only one hundred pounds in English
coin. Happily, the emission was only eight thousand pounds. However, in 1712, the South Carolina legislature issued forty-eight thousand pounds, in these bills of credit, to defray the expenses of their
Indian wars.
5. About the year 1691, during the progress of King William's
war, Massachusetts issued bills of credit to pay the troops. Connecticut, New York and New Jersey followed in train, in 1709, and issued
their paper money, and for the same reason, viz., to pay the expenses
of their Indian wars. The legislature of Georgia issued paper bills
of credit to the amount of seven thousand four hundred and ten pounds
sterling, in 1760. There were also some other instances in the colonies of the same sort.
6. The first emission of bills of credit by congress was in June,
1775. The amount was two millions of dollars. Eighteen months
afterward, twenty millions of dollars more were issued; and still later,
a larger quantity; in all, three hundred and seventy-five millions.
The states also issued many millions.  In 1780, at leasttwo hundred
millions of continental money were in circulation.

7. The confederation was indeed pledged to redeem these bills, and
each colony its proportion of them, by the year 1779. Nevertheless,
they began to lose their value in 1777, and by the year 1778, the
period to which, in the progress of our history, we have now arrived,
five or six dollars of it would only pass for one.
8. But this was only the beginning of its depreciation. In 1779,
twenty-seven or twenty-eight dollars of it were only worth one of hard
monley, and in 1780 it was fifty or sixty for one. By the middle of
this year, the bills almost ceased to circulate; and when they did
circulate, it was at less than a hundredth part of their nominal value,
sometimes less than the five hundredth.
9. Yet congress had ordered that they should be a lawful tender
for the payment of debts, at their full nominal value, and the soldiers
were to be paid in them. Why should not a war be poorly sustained
with such a miserable public currency?
10. How could men be raised to fight, even for their homes and
firesides, when the money in which they were to be paid would not
support their families  Six months' pay of a soldier, in 1779, would
not provide bread for his family for a month; nor the pay of a colonel
"purchase oats for his horse."
11. There were many causes which operated to produce this unheard-of depreciation of a currency which the nation was bound to
redeem. 1. Too much of it was issued. 2. The quantity was greatly
increased by counterfeits and forgeries. 3. It was for the pecuniary
advantage of public agents - since they received a commission proportioned to the amount of their purchases for the army- to pay high
prices. 4. There was a doubt of the ability of the states to pay these
notes, as well as a distrust of the faith of the states, in respect to their
redemption.
12. But whatever the causes may have been, and however promis
ing its first effects, no measure of congress produced more mischief,
in the end, by weakening and destroying public confidence, than this
same continental money. It may be difficult, however, to say by
what other means the war could have been sustained.
CHAPTER CXX.
Capture of Stony Point and Paulus Hook.
1. THERE were two brilliant and somewhat decisive actions in the
vicinity of New York, during the year 1779. One of these was the
capture of Stony Point, a strong military post on the west bank of the
Hudson, guarded by about six hundred British troops. Anxious to

regain this post, Washington deputed General Wayne, with twelve
hundred men, chiefly New Englanders, to make the attempt.
2. General Wayne set out on the 15th of July, and, at evening,
halted a mile or two from the fort to make his arrangements. One
hundred and fifty volunteers, guarded by twenty picked men, were to
ularch in front of the rest. They were ordered to proceed in perfect
silence, with unloaded guns and fixed bayonets.
3. The attempt was perilous. One disorderly fellow persisted in a
determination to load his gun, for which he was killed by his captain
on the spot. The fort was defended by a deep swamp, covered with
water. The troops marched through it, waist deep. The British
opened upon them a tremendous fire of musketry and artillery; still,
thile Americans were not allowed to fire a gun.
4. But their success was complete. The fort was carried at the
point of the bayonet, and its surviving defenders all takenll.  The
Americans lost about a hundred men, in the onset, of whom seventeen were of the twenty picked guards who went in front of the rest.
The British had sixty-eight killed - the rest surrendering at discretion.
5. General Wayne was among the wounded of the Americans.
As they were entering the fort, a musket-ball cut a gash in his forehead. He fell, but rose upon one knee, and said, "Forward, my
brave fellows, forward." Then, in a low voice, he said to one of his
aids, "Assist me; if I die, I will die in the fort!"  But the wound
proved less severe than was at first expected.
6. General Wayne was a truly brave man. He was at this time
about thirty-five years of age; but, though young, he was old in war
-having been continually employed in the most active services of his
country, for four years. He had been in Canada, at Ticonderoga, at
Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and several other points of
great hazard and danger.
7. For this brilliant attack on Stony Point, congress gave thanks
to Washington who contrived it, and a gold medal to Wayne who
executed it. But the army gained, with the fort, something besides
mere honor. A large quantity of military stores, of which they stood
in great and almost perishing need, fell into their hands.
8. This successful adventure was followed, in a few days, by
another. Major Lee, with three hundred men, made a descent upon
Paulus Hook, a British post, on the New Jersey shore, opposite New
York, which he completely surprised and carried, with but two men
killed and three wounded.

THE WAR WITH THE INDIANS.
CHAPTER CXXI.
The War with the Indians.
1. THa, history of events in the United States, for the year 1779,
would be incomplete without some further accounts of the war with
the Indians. Trhese, except in the vicinity of Wyoming, were yet
very troublesome.
2. In April and May of this year, a small body of men from Fort
Schuyler marched against the Onondaga Indians, and burnt their
village, consisting of about fifty houses, with a large quantity of provisions, without the loss of a single man. They also took thirty-four
prisoners.
3. Detached parties of men were also sent out against the Indians
on the borders of South Carolina, and in the neighborhood of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.  On the frontier of South Carolina, eight
Indian towns were destroyed; and in the neighborhood of Pittsburg, a number of Indian huts and about five hundred acres of
corn.
4. The " Six Nations," as they were called, had promised to be
neutral in the war; but, except the Oneidas, they became at length
quite troublesome - plundering, burning, and murdering. They were
instigated, no doubt, by the British agents. General Sullivan, with a
part of the American army, was at length sent out against them. He
arrived in their country in August.
5. The Indians, aware of his approach, had fortified themselves
after the English fashion. They defended themselves most manfully
against the attack of General Sullivan for more than two hours.
They were, however, finally driven from the position, and their villages, gardens, corn and firuits, were destroyed.
6. Still it was in the power of detached parties of the Indians to do
much mischief. In July, about the time of the Wyominiiig massacre,
Brandt, the half-blood chief, with a body of Indians and tories, burnt
ten houses and killed forty-four men at Minisink settlement, near the
Hudson. The bones of those who fell there, after whitening in the
sun forty-three years, were, in 1823, collected and buried, with much
ceremony.

CHAPTER CXXII.
Surrender of Charleston.
1. THE greater part of the American army at the north had wintered in Morristown, New Jersey. There were, it is true, strong
detachments at West Point, and other posts about the Hudson, and a
body of cavalry in Connecticut. Little was done on either side during
the winter, which was one of unusual severity. In truth, the sufferhugs of the army were so great that Washington, at times, thought of
disbanding them.
2. The army, for the campaign of 1780, was fixed by congress at
thirty-five thousand two hundred and eleven; of which each state was
to furnish its proportion by the first day of April. But it was easier
to collect an army on paper than actually to procure the enlistments.
Only ten thousand four hundred men could be mustered in April;
while the British force, at New York, was seventeen thousand three
hundred.
3. Nor was the condition of the American army at all encouraging.
Their wages were five months in arrears; their food was scanty, and
sometimes bad; they had no sugar, tea, wine, spirits, or medicine;
and, worst of all, no prospect before them of anything better.
4. Bad as the circumstances were, however, the spring was spent
in preparation for war. In April, La Fayette returned from France,
with the cheeringf intelligence that a large land and naval force might
soon be expected from that country. They did not arrive till July;,nd, until their arrival, the war at the north was confined to a little
skirmishing.
5. But not so at the south. Sir Henry Clinton, with seven thousand or eight thousand men, had landed at Savannah, early this year,
and sailed from that place to attack Charleston, which, at the time,
was defended by the commander-in-chief of the army of the south,
General Lincoln, and Governor Rutledge. He opened his batteries
upon the city April 2.
6. The American forces amounted to about five thousand men;
and they had four hundred pieces of artillery. But the forces of the
enemy were much greater, and the siege was carried on with spirit.
On the eleventh of May, the Americans concluded to surrender;not, however, till near one hundred of their number had been slain,
and one hundred and forty wounded.
7. On the 14th of April, while the siege of Charleston was going
on, a body of American cavalry and militia was surprised by the
British at Monk's Corner, thirty-two miles from Charleston, and

dispersed. Fort Moultrie, also, on Sullivan's Island, had surrendered
the same day to the British naval forces.
8. Another misfortune befel the American army at the south, on
the 29th of May. Lord Cornwallis, who commanded a division of
the British troops, near the Santee river, detached a body of his men
to a place in North Carolina, called the Waxhaws, and completely
cut off a corps of four hundred men, under Colonel Bufford; only one
hundred effecting their escape.
9. The southern American army being now greatly reduced, the
British found it easy to post garrisons in various parts of Carolina,
and to regard it as, in effect, conquered. Only four thousand men
were deemed necessary to complete what they had so well begun,
and, with the rest of the army Sir Henry Clinton returned to New
York.
10. Meanwhile, the state, though overrun, was very far from being
conquered. A partisan war was long kept up, sometimes with much
spirit. Many gallant exploits were performed, and many petty victories obtained, by Generals Sumpter, Marion, and others; so that
the British could hardly fail to learn that to gain a few victories and
to conquer a country were very different thinrgs.
CHAPTER CXXIII.
Battle near Camden.
1. ABOUT this period, General Lincoln was superseded in the command of the American army at the south, by General Gates. The
Baron D'Kalb, a brave German officer, was second in the command.
Their troops amounted to one thousand regular soldiers and three
thousand militia.
2. General Horatio Gates was an Englishman by birth, but had
been often sent over to America, in the progress of the colonial wars.
Somewhere between the years 1763 and 1770, he removed to America and settled in Virginia. In 1775, he was made a brigadier general.
He continued in the army - chiefly at the north- till the year 1780,
when he was transferred to the south.
3. At the time of the capture of Burgoyne, Gates was about fifty
years of age. This event made him extremely popular, while Washington, less fortunate, was at this juncture rather unpopular. Efforts
were made to remove Washington from the command of the army and
supply his place by Gates, but they were as unsuccessful as they
were unreasonable.

Virginia militia joined him. When near Camden, he was met by
Lord Cornwallis and two thousand regular troops, who gave himi
battle. The Virginia militia and part of the others fled at the beginning of the fight. The regular soldiers behaved well, but were finally
overpowered by numbers.
5. The battle was fought August 16, and was exceedingly severe.
Not only the battle-ground itself, but the fields, roads and swamps,
for many miles round, were covered, as it were, with the slain. Of
the Americans, seven hundred and thirty-two were killed or captured;
and of the British, about half as many. Among the slain was the
Baron D'Kalb, to whose memory congress ordered a monument to be
erected.
6. Another defeat soon followed. General Sumpter, having taken
a small fort, with about three hundred prisoners, and a large quantity
of stores intended for the British army at Camden, was retreating
with his booty up the Wateree river, when Colonel Tarleton, with a
part of the British army, surprised him, rescued the prisoners, and
killed, wounded or dispersed his whole force.
7. But, after this long series of reverses, the tide of the southern
war began to turn. At a place called King's Mountain, the British
were defeated, with but little loss on the part of the Americans. No
less than eight hundred of their best troops were taken prisoners, with
fifteen hundred stands of arms.
8. The British were also defeated, on the 12th of November, in a
partial engagement.at Broad river; and, again, eight days afterward,
on Tiger river. The losses, however, in either of these two last
engagements, were but trifling; nor were the advantages gained of
very great consequence.
9. It has been seen in another place that little was done at the
north during the early part of the year 1780. In June, about five
thousand British soldiers, under General Kniphausen, plundered and
burnt several villages in New Jersey, and, in a few instances, committed the grossest acts of barbarity.
10. The arrival of the French at Newport, July 10, 1780, with
seven sail of the line, five frigates, five smaller vessels and several
transports, and about six thousand men, under Count Rochambeau, a
spirited officer, infused new courage into the whole country, and perhaps gave a turn to the war.

New York and Vermont; and he claimed possession of Canada in
behalf of the French.
3. Though. the French were early attracted to Florida, the Spaniards were before them. Ponce de Leon, a voyager with Columbus,
having become disaffected towards him, proceeded from Porto Rico,
in March, 1512, to make discoveries by himself. He found a new
region, on the 6th of April, to which he gave the name of Florida,
on account of its florid or blooming appearance.
4. The king of Spain, in whose name Leon claimed the country,
appointed him the governor of it, on condition of his establishing a
colony there. In attempting to effect a settlement, he met with many
remarkable adventures; finally his people were attacked by the Indians
and driven away, and he was himself mortally wounded.
5. In 1520, two slave ships were fitted out at St. Domingo, which
proceeded to the coast of South Carolina, and having decoyed the
native Indians on board, suddenly set sail and carried them to St. Domingo. It is not surprising, from this and similar outrages, that the
savages of the continent, from one end of it to the other, became suspicious of white men.
6. In 1540, Ferdinand de Soto made a tour through Florida, northward, to Georgia, and thence westward, across the Cherokee country
and Alabama, to the country of the Chicklasaws, where he spent the
winter. In the spring of 1541, he discovered and crossed the Mississippi, and travelled in Arkansas and Missouri. He died in 1542, and
his companions passed through Louisiana to Mexico.
7. The details of this expedition are full of interest. The Indians
of these regions, at this period, were numerous; and their manners
and customs present much that is curious.

CHAPTER CXXIV.
Slavery in the United States.
1. ONE victory was achieved this year, in the state of Pennsylvania, of a very different kind from most of the victories which were
gained about this period. Grateful for their own deliverance from
slavery to Great Britain, the legislature passed an act for the abolition
of African slavery.
2. The history of slavery in these states is at once curious and
instructive. The royal ordinances of Spain, according to Bancroft,
authorized negro slavery in America as early as 1501. In 1503,
there were such numbers of Africans in the island of Hispaniola, that
Ovando, the Spanish governor, entreated the king that their importation might be niio longer permitted.
3. The first slaves brought to the United States were landed from
a Dutch vessel at Jamestown, about the year 1619. They were
twenty in number. In 1645, a ship, belonging to John Keyser and
James Smith, sailed for Guinea, to trade for negroes; but a cry was
raised against them that they were malefactors and murderers.
4. It is true that the articles of the early New England confederacy class persons among the spoils of war. The remnant of the
Pequod Indians in Connecticut; the captive Indians made by Waldron
in New Hampshire; a remnant of the tribe of Annawon, and even
the orphan children of King Philip, were all enslaved. In Virginia
and Carolina, for one hundred years, the Indian tribes were not secure
against the kidnapper.
5. But however ready the public mind was to connive at the
slavery of the Indian tribes, the importation of African slaves to
Massachusetts was early regarded as an offence against God and man,
and the slave trade was at length forbidden under the penalty of
death. In 1645, a negro, who had been enslaved near Portsmouth,
was demanded, by the general court of Massachusetts, that he might
be sent back to Africa.
- 6. For many years, the Dutch were the principal means of bringing slaves to Virginia; but, at length, others became involved in the
traffic, and they were introduced, in spite of the laws, into all the
colonies. The assembly of Maryland even passed an act, in 1671,
for" encouraging the importation of negroes and slaves."
7. In 1701, the " Guinea Company," for transporting slaves into
the Spanish settlements of America, was established. But the same

period to negro slavery. Ill 1703, in addition to former laws, Massa
chusetts imposed a heavy duty on every negro imported.
8. Attempts were also made in Virginia, as early as 1699, to checl
the slave trade, by the imposition of heavy duties.  It was not, how
ever, till 1778, that Virginia abolished the traffie in slaves by positive
enactment.  Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and the othei
states followed the example soonI afterward.
9. But, though the traffic was prohibited, the slaves increased
rapidly, not only by a natural progress, but in various other ways
In 1723, the slaves in South Carolina, consisting chiefly of negroes
amounted to eighteen thousand -the whites being only fourteel
thousand. In 1784, the whole number in the Union was six hundree
thousand; and, though the third congress prohibited the slave trade
altogether, they have continued to increase, till the whole number is
but little short of three millions.
10. In 1740, the legislature of South Carolina passed an act,
"that whosoever shall teach or cause any slave or slaves to write, or
shall use or employ any slave as a scribe, in any manner of writing
whatsoever, shall, for every such offence, forfeit the sum of one hundred pounds sterling," in "current money."  Laws of a similar kind
were subsequently passed in other colonies.
11. In less than nine months, ending July 21, 1773, no less than
six thousand four hundred and seventy-one African slaves were
imported into South Carolina, and nearly all of them directly firom
Africa. But there was a current setting the other way shortly afterward. When the British evacuated Charleston, in 1782, eight hundred slaves were shipped to the West Indies, and it is computed that
the state lost, during the whole war, in this and other ways, about
twenty-five thousand.
12. Since the beginning of the present century, attempts have been
made, both by legislation and benevolent effort, to open a door to the
general manumission of slaves in the United States, by establishing
colonies in distant parts, especially on the western shore of Africa.
Others, however, have opposed such efforts, and labored with much
zeal in behalf of immediate and universal emancipation.

the treason of General Arnold, and the capture and execution of
Major Andre, an excellent British officer, as a spy.
2. General Benedict Arnold was a native of Norwich, in Connecticut. His father was a man of doubtful integrity; though he had a
good mother. His education was such merely as the common schools
of the place could give. While yet a lad, he was apprenticed to a
firm of druggists, in Norwich; but he ran away several times during
his apprenticeship, besides being, in other ways, a source of perpetual
trouble to his friends.
3. Everything pertaining to this early period of his life indicated a
want, in him, of conscientiousness; - cruelty, ill-temper, and recklessness with regard to the good or ill opinion of others. Robbing
birds' nests, maiming and mangling young birds, to draw forth cries
from the old ones, vexing children, and calling them hard names, and
even beating them, were among his frequent, if not daily, pastimes.
4. He was also fond of daring, not to say dangerous, feats. For
example, he sometimes took grain to a grist mill in the neighborhood,
and, while waiting for the meal, he would amuse himself and astonish
his playmates, by clinging to the arms of the large water-wheel and
passing with it beneath and above the water.
5. At the close of his apprenticeship, he commenced business as a
druggist in New Haven. His enterprise and activity ensured success
for a time; but his speculations ended in bankruptcy. He returned,
it is true, to his business; but he was never esteemed for honesty or
solid integrity, either before or afterward.

Lexington came, Arnold, who had become a captain of what were
called the governor's guard, took occasion to harangue the people,
and call for volunteers. Sixty men joined him, and they set out for
Cambridge, His subsequent movemenrts have been alluded to in
other chapters.
7. The fall of 1780 found him in the command of West Point, on
the Hudson. Here he entered into an arrangement with Sir Henry
Clinton, the British commander in New York, to give up the men,
arms, stores, &amp;c., at West Point, to the British. Such a result, had
it not been for a timely discovery of the plot, would doubtless have
been effected.
8. What adds greatly to the wickedness of Arnold, in this matter,
is the fact that he had the entire confidence of Washington, by whom
he had always been well treated, and also that he had solicited the
command of West Point with a special view to the commission of
this act of treachery. Had lie betrayed Washington and his country
in a moment of angry excitement, the case would have been far different.

was an accomplished young man, about twenty-nine years of age.
To favor his communications with Arnold, the Vulture, a British
sloop of war, had been previously stationed in the Hudson, as neai
West Point as it could be without exciting suspicion.
2. On the night of September 21st, a boat was sent from the shore
to bring Maj. Andre. When it returned, Arnold met him at the beach,
outside of the forts of both armies. Their business not being finished
till it was too near morning for Andre to return to the Vulture, he
was obliged to conceal himself for the day within the American lines
3. During his absence, the Vulture had changed her positioni, and
Andre, unable to get on board, was compelled to set out for New
York by land. After exchanging his uniform for a plain dress, and
receiving a passport from Arnold, under the name of John Anderson,
hle set out on horseback, and made the best of his way down the river.
4. He had the address, with the aid of his passport, to escape the
suspicions of the guards and outposts of the army. But when he came
to Tarrytown, a small village about thirty miles north of New York,
on the east side of the river, he was mnet by three New York militia
belonging to a scouting party, who, after examinining his papers,
allowed him to pass on.
5. One of thenm, however, suspecting from his appearance that all
was not right, called him back. Andre asked them where they were
from. "From down below," they replied. "So am I," said he.
They then arrested him; upon which he owned he was a British

needy. They conducted him to Colonel Jameson, their commander,
who, while he secured him, incautiously allowed him to drop a line to
Arnold, who, on receiving the letter, went at once on board the Vulture, and thus escaped the punishment which would otherwise have
been inflicted.
7. Washington, at this moment, was on his way from Connecticut,
where he had been to confer with Count Rochamibeau. He arrived
at West Point just in time to save it from being delivered up to the
British, but not in time to take Arnold.
8. Andre, in the mean time, was tried by a board of fourteen
military officers, who, after hearing his confession- for he was too
noble a man to deny any part of the truth- unanimously pronounced
him to be a spy; and declared that, "agreeably to the laws and
usages of nations, he should suffer death."
9. He was unwilling to die on a gibbet or gallows; but requested
to be shot. Washington, moved by his appeals, presented his request
to his officers; but it was refused. He expired on a gallows, Octo
ber 2, 1780, at Tappan, in New Jersey, twenty-eight miles above
New York.
10. The three brave young men who took him, whose names
were Paulding, Williams, and Van Wert, were rewarded by congress, in an annual pension of two hundred dollars each for life, and
a silver medal, on one side of which was a shield, inscribed, "Fidelity;" and on the other the motto, Vincit amor patritc, or "the love
of country conquers."
11. Washington concerted a plan for seizing Arnold, and saving
Andre, but it did not succeed. Champe, a bold and persevering
soldier, was to desert to the British army, in New York, watch his
opportunity, and bring off Arnold to the American camp. After
seizing Arnold, he was to have been met at the lines of the two armies
and assisted in securing him. Champe entered upon the project, and
had nearly succeeded, when Arnold suddenly changed his quarters,
and the scheme failed.

at least one more; it is the dreadful system of retaliation. If one
opposing party burns a village, or plunders private property, or hangs
deserters, the other is apt to do so, in order to avenge itself or retaliate.

year 1776, Capt. Nathan Hale passed over to the island in disguise,
and examined carefully every part of the British army, and found out
its general plan of movement; but just as he was ready to return, he
was taken, found guilty, and executed. The presence of a clergy
man, and even the use of a Bible, were denied him, and the letters
which he wrote to his friends were destroyed.
3. The Americans never forgot this. While the war was going
on with Burgoyne in the north, and General Clinton was trying to
force a passage up the Hudson, spies and scouts were constantly
passing between the two armies. One Palmer was at last caught
by the army under General Putnam, and executed. He had been an
American tory, but had deserted to the British, and received a lieutenant's commission.
4. The British general in New York, having heard of the arrest
of Palmer, wrote to General Putnam, entreating that he might be
spared, and threatening vengeance in case of a refusal. But neither
his entreaties nor his threats moved Putnam, and Palmer was conIdemned as a spy and executed.
5. The brave Colonel Trumbull has been mentioned. He was in
London when the news of Andre's death arrived, and though he had
been entirely disconnected from the army for several years, he was
now carefully watched, and at length taken and subjected to a rigid
examination. Their rough method of examination not pleasing him,
he soon brought it to a close by a voluntary confession.
6. "I will put an end to all this insolent folly," said he, "by telling you who and what I am. I am an American -my name is
Trumbull; I am son of him whom you call the rebel governor of
Connecticut; I have served in the rebel American army; I have had
the honor of being aid-de-camp to him whom you call the rebel General Washington."
7. He was respected for his frankness and his spirit, but not released. After further examination, he was committed to prison, and
would probably have been executed but for the kind interference of
West, the painter, then in London and on good terms with the king,
who persuaded the latter to spare his life. He was, however, kept
in close confinement seven months.

explains the secret of his fall His vanity and extravagance had involved him in debt, and he sold himself and his country for the means
of replenishing his purse.
2. Soon after his arrival in New York, he published an "Address
to the inhabitants of America," explaining the course he had pursued,
and endeavoring to justify himself in it. It was of little force, however. It was rather a tirade against congress and the alliance with
the French, than an address to the Americans, or an apology for his
own conduct.
3. In about two months after he joined the British, he was appointed to the command of an expedition against Virginia, consisting
of sixteen hundred men. A violent gale separated the fleet in which
he and his men had embarked, but they all arrived at Hampton Roads
about December 30, except four hundred of the troops, who were a
week later.
4. Not waiting for those who were missing, Arnold proceeded up
the James river, burning and plundering, without regard to any distinction between public and private property. After doing all the
mischief he could, he descended the river, and stationed himself at
Portsmouth; and in a few weeks returned to New York.
5. Washington and La Fayette exerted themselves to the utmost
to take him, but without success. A French fleet had been even sent
to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, chiefly for this service, and ten
of the vessels, with a British forty-four gun ship, were captured; but
Arnold took care to secure his own person.
6. We hear no more of Arnold, except that he endeavored, without success, to make an attack upon West Point, till the autumn of
1781, when he made a descent, with fifteen hundred men, upon the
mouth of the Connecticut river, took Forts Trumbull and Griswold,
committed a most merciless slaughter after the troops had partly surrendered, and burnt New London.
7. Not long after these last events, he sailed for England. He
lived till the year 1801, but he was almost unnoticed. A small part
of his time was spent at St. John's in the province of New Brunswick, and in the West Indies; but the greater portion of it was spent
in London, where he died at the age of sixty-one years.
CHAPTER CXXIX.
The War at the South.

227228                 THE WAR AT THE SOUTH.
2. The troops wintered, for the most part, in New Jersey, as they
had done the year before. In the spring of 1781, the Pennsylvania
troops, to the number of thirteen hundred, revolted and rebelled for
want of pay. It was found, on examination, that their complaints
were well founded. Their claims being met, the rebellion ceased.
3. Little was done at the north, during the year 1781, except what
nas been mentioned in connection with the story of Arnold. The
war was principally at the south. General Greene had succeeded to
General Gates, as the commander in chief of the army there, and
things were beginning to wear an aspect much more favorable.
4. A brilliant victory was obtained, January 17, of this year, by a
part of General Greene's army, under General Morgan, at a place
called the Cowpens, in the western part of South Carolina, over a
detachment of British troops under Colonel Tarleton. The latter had
one thousand of the best men of the army; the former about five
hundred regulars and a few raw militia, only half clothed and half
fed.
5. The Americans, with a loss of only twelve in killed and sixty
wounded, took five hundred prisoners, besides twelve standards, two
pieces of artillery, eight hundred muskets, thirty-five baggage wagons,
and one hundred horses, and killed one hundred and wounded two
hundred men. So disastrous an event gave a permanent check to the
progress of the British troops in the southern states.
6. At the time of the defeat of Tarleton, Lord Cornwallis was on
the point of invading North Carolina, but he now went in pursuit of
General Morgan. General Greene, suspecting his intentions, set out
with his troops to reinforce Morgan, and came up with Cornwallis at

Guilford court-house. He had still but a miserable army of about
two thousand men, half' of whom were militia.
7. Here, on the 8th of May, a severe engagement tbok place, in
which, though the British lost in killed and wounded about five hundred men, they were at last victorious. The Americans lost about
four hundred men, mostly regular troops - the militia having fled at
the beginning of the battle.
8. Another battle was fought, on the 25th of May, at Camden.
The British had fortified the place, and left Lord Rawdon and nine
hundred men to guard it. General Greene, with twelve hundred
men, attacked them, but was at length obliged to retreat without
accomplishing his purpose.
9. But all these victories of the British were dearly bought, and
were fast reducing their strength. The defence of Camden alone,
though successful, had cost them nearly three hundred out of nine
hundred men. It was therefore concluded, not only to evacuate
Camden, but also all their other posts in Carolina, except Ninety-Six
and Charleston. Here they still had strong forces.
10. The former place was attacked by General Greene, but he was
again unsuccessful, though the British some time afterward evacuated
the place and retired to the Eutaw Springs, forty miles from Charleston. A close engagement took place at these Springs, June 8, in
which both sides claimed the victory. The British lost, in killed,
wounded, and missing, eleven hundred men; the Americans half as
many.
11. This finished the war, for a time, in South Carolina. The
British retired to Charleston, and General Greene, satisfied with
driving them out of the country, did not molest them further. For
his good conduct at the Eutaw Springs and elsewhere, congress presented him with a British standard and a gold medal.

1. THE naval operations of the war have been in part alluded to in
connection with the story of Paul Jones. A few other engagements,
of the years 1779, 1780, and 1781, remain to be mentioned.
2. Some time in the spring of the year 1779, the Hampden, a
twenty-two gun ship, that sailed for Massachusetts, engaged an English vessel, five hundred miles north of the Azores. In this action,
though the Hampden was obliged to haul off, as the sea phrase is,
the British were not disposed to triumph. This is said to have been
one of the mnost closely contested actions of the war.

Elizabeth sent out the celebrated and accomplished Sir Walter
Raleigh, on a voyage of discovery. He entered Pamlico Sound, and
explored the coast northward. The queen bestowed upon this region
the name of Virginia.
9. Among the discoveries of minor importance, made towards the
close of the sixteenth century, were those of Bartholomew Gosnold,
an Englishman. In a voyage to Virginia, as the whole coast was
then called, he discovered and named Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard,
and Elizabeth Island; he attempted to form a settlement on the
latter, but without success.
CHAPTER X.
Settlement at Jamestown.
1. WE must now leave the general current of events in America
and turnr our attention, particularly, to the settlement and progress
of our own country, the United States.    While the Spaniards
Portuguese, French, and other nations, were carving out the New
World to suit themselves, we must now consider the operations of the
English in North America.
2. But, as our attention will first be directed to the southern
section of our country, let us study the map at p. 24. This presents us with a view of the Southern States, as they now appear.
We shall here see divisions of states and locations of towns, which
did not exist at the time at which our history commences. The
mountains, rivers, shores and waters, were, however, the same.
3. One hundred and fifteen years passed away, after the disco:very
of America by Columbus, and one hundred and ten after the discovery of the continent by the Cabots, and no permanent settlement had
yet been effected within the limits of what are now called the United
States.
4. But a new era in the history of this western world was at hand.
A company had been formned in England, under the patronage of king
James I., whose object was to make settlements anywhere in America between the 34th and 38th degrees of north latitude; or in what
was then called South Virginia. For this purpose they obtained a
royal grant or patent.
5. In May, 1607, a colony of one hundred and five persons, under
the direction of this company, arrived off the coast of South Virginia.
Their first intention had been to form a settlement on Roanoke island;
but, being driven further to the north in a violent storm, they discovered and entered the mouth of Chesapeake Bay.

3. During the summer of 1779, Colonel Nicholson, with the
Drane, of thirty-two guns, and the Boston, of twenty-four, made a
cruise, in which he took many prizes, but fought no important battle.
The Providence, of twelve guns, this year took the Diligent, a British
vessel of equal size; and the Hazard, of fourteen guns, took the
British vessel Active, of eighteen guns, after a bloody battle of thirty
minutes.
4. During the early part of the year 1780, while the French fleet,
under Count D'Estaing, was in the East Indies, the British, by means
of their superior force, were able to capture or destroy a considerable
part of the little navy of the United States. The Providence, twentyeight guns, the Queen of France, twenty-eight, the Boston, twentyfour, the Ranger, eighteen, and several others, successively fell into
their hands.
5. On the 2d of June, a most severely contested action was fought,
some five hundred miles eastward of the coast of Virginia, between
the Trumbull, of twenty-eight guns, Com. Nicholson, and the Watt,
Capt. Coulthard, of thirty-two or thirty-six guns. The Trumbull
had thirty-nine men killed and wounded;:the Watt nearly a hundred.
The latter however escaped.
6. In October, of the same year, the Saratoga, of sixteen guns,
Capt. Young, captured a British ship of war and two brigs, after a
short but very spirited action. The Saratoga was run alongside of
the enemy's vessel at once, and her men boarded her and fought for
victory on the deck of the enemy's ship, and against a force double
their own.
7. During the year 1781, the Alliance, of thirty-two guns, Capt.
Barry, had several engagements with vessels nearly her own size, in
all of which she was victorious. The principal of these was on the
28th of May. On this occasion she fought two ships, one of sixteen
guns and another of fourteen. Both were taken.
8. The Trumbull, still under the command of Comn. Nicholson, had
a most sanguinary engagement, on the 8th of August of this year, off
the Capes of Delaware, with the British frigate Iris, of thirty-two
guns, and the Shark, of eighteen, in which the Trumbull was finally
captured; but not till she had first almost disabled the Iris.
9. Some other engagements took place on the ocean, both in 1781
and 1782, but they were chiefly of the same general character with
those described above. Let us now return to the war in the southern
states, between Greene and Cornwallis.

230SURRENDER OF LORD CORNWALLIS.                 231
CHAPTER CXXXI.
Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.
1. SOON after the battle at Guilford court-house, Cornwallis left
South Carolina to the care of Lord Rawdon, and marched into Virginia. This was just after the French fleet, with a land force of
three thousand men, under La Fayette, which had been sent against
Arnold, had returned toward the north. On reaching Elkton, in
Maryland, La Fayette heard of the arrival of Lord Cornwallis at
Petersburg, and hastened with his troops to meet him.
2. As La Fayette approached Petersburg, Cornwallis offered him
battle; but finding his forces greatly inferior to those of the British,
he chose to retreat and wait for reinforcements. Meanwhile, Washington and other officers at the north were making every possible preparation for an attack upon New York; and were already concentrating their forces at Kingsbridge.
3. About this time, Cornwallis received a reilnforcement of troops,
upon which he marched to Yorktown, near the head of York river,
on its southern banks, and forthwith began to fortify the place, as
well as Gloucester, on the opposite side of the river. His whole force
now amounted to about seven thousand men.
4. Just at this time, Washington learned that the French fleet,
which was expected to unite with him in the siege of New York, was
about to sail for the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. This changed
his determination, though he did not suffer the change to be known;
and he hastened his forces at oince to Yorktown.

5. On the 30th of September, the combined armies of the north
and south, amounting to twelve thousand men, were fairly encamped
round about Yorktown and Gloucester, while the French fleet, under
Count de Grasse, blockaded the mouth of the river, to prevent Cornwallis from receiving any assistance from New York or elsewhere,
and from making his escape.
6. Washington arrived in person on the 6th of October, and the
siege was carried on with so much vigor, that, on the 19th of October, 1781, Lord Cornwallis found himnself obliged to surrender -an
event which two months before was as unexpected by the Americans
as it was by the British government.
7. At the capture of Charleston, eighteen months before, by the
British, much pains had been taken to render the manner of the surrender as humiliating to the Americans as possible. This was remembered by the victorious army at Yorktown, and retaliated. So humiliating indeed was it, that Lord Cornwallis would not appear in person
to give up his sword, but sent it by Gen. O'Hara.
8. So rapid, and, at the same time, so recent had been the move
ments of Washington and his army to the south, that the British did
not for some time suspect his departure from the neighborhood of
New York. When they learned what was goingr on, they sailed for
the south, but Cornwallis had surrendered several days before their
arrival.
9. This important event revived the dying hopes of the country,
and diffused universal joy, of which the strongest public testimonials
were everywhere given. Nothing was to be heard, for some time,
but the praises of Washington, La Fayette, Rochambeau and De
Grasse. The war was now thought to be chiefly over. The 30th
of the December following was appointed by congress as a day of
national thanksgiving.
10. The British still occupied New York, Charleston, Savannah,
and a few other posts; but they no longer, as before, overran New
Jersey and the Carolinas. Nor was there, in truth, much more hard
fighting. The fall of Cornwallis may therefore be justly said to
have decided the war; and to have decided it in favor of the Americans.
11. Among the more considerable events of the year 1781, in
addition to a few which have already been noticed, was an expedition, late in the autumn, against the Cherokee Indians, who had
recently been troublesome.  In this expedition, thirteen of their
towns and villages were burnt, and many of the Indians were
slain.
12. Soon after the capture of Cornwallis, the northern division of
the American army returned to their old position on the Hudson,
while the French troops and the southern division of the army remained in and about Virginia. Count de Grasse sailed with his fleet
to the West Indies, where they spent the winter.

which congress had prepared and signed, and sent to the several
states for adoption, were finally signed by them all, this year. Till
this time there had been objections, of one sort or another, made, and
amendments proposed; but it was at length seen necessary to unite,
in order to_ sustain the contest with Great Britain.

T'reaty of Peace.
Sir Guy Carleton.
1. AFTER the surrender of Lord Cornwallis, the war with America
began to be quite unpopular in England; but nothing decisive was
done to put an end to it till March, 1782, when the house of commons
passed a resolution against prosecuting, or attempting to prosecute,
the American war any further. Still the troops were not withdrawn
immediately.
2. The first truly pacific public measure adopted by Great Britain
was that of appointing Sir Guy Carleton to the command of the forces
in America, and directing him to settle the differences between the
two countries. This officer endeavored to open a correspondence
with congress for this purpose; but they refused to do anything
except in concert with the French allies.
3. It was not till late in the year 1782, that anything effectual was
done towards making peace between the two countries. At length,
did the Americans and French now station themselves? 13. What of the articles of confederation.

however, by the advice and request of the French court, two commissioners on the part of Great Britain, Messrs. Fitzherbert and Oswald, and four on the part of the United States, John Adams, Benj.
Franklin, John Jay and Henry Laurens, met at Paris.
4. Here, after consulting long on the subject, they formed what
were called provisional articles of peace. These were signed on the
30th of November. On the 20th of January, 1783, it was agreed by
the-commissioners that all hostilities between the two countries should
cease. The news of this was received in the United States on the
24th of the March following.
5. On the 19th of April, precisely eight years after the battle of
Lexington, Washington issued a proclamation of peace. There had
been no blood shed, however, or almost none, for nearly eight months.
A definitive treaty of peace was made and signed at Paris, September
3, 1783, by which Great Britain acknowledged the independence of
the United States.
6. This acknowledgment had been already made by several of the
countries of Europe. Sweden had acknowledged it Feb. 5; Denmark, Feb. 25; Spain, March 24th; and Russia in July. Treaties
of amity and peace were also made between the United States and
these several nations.
7. The United States army was kept together till the third day of
November. On that day, after due preparation had been made, it was
disbanded in due form. Washington, in an affectionate address, first
bade farewell to his soldiers, and subsequently to his officers. These
last, at parting, he took by the hand, separately. The formalities of
bidding adieu took place at New York.
8. The British do not appear to have left New York till the 25th
of the same month, though Charleston and Savannah had been evacuated long before. It may seem a little surprising that the British
should remain at New York so long. One reason for the delay was
the want of transports for carrying away their military stores and
supplies, as well as for conducting to Nova Scotia the refugees who
had fled to them from all parts of the country for protection.
9. On the 23d of December, Washington appeared in the hall of
congress at Annapolis, and resigned his commission. The act of
resignation was accompanied by a short but affecting speech, in
which, after recounting briefly the events of the war, he commended
his country, and all concerned in the administration of its affairs, to
the special protection of Heaven.
10. Congress, in accepting his commission, replied to him, through
Gen. Mifflin, their president, in a manner expressive of their confidence in his wisdom, and their gratitude for his services. He then
left them at Annapolis, and hastened to his family and farm at Mount
Vernon, where he hoped to spend the remainder of his days.

235EFFECTS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.
CHAPTER CXXXlII.
Effects of the American Revolution.
1. THus ended a war of almost eight years' duration, in which a
hundred thousand lives were lost, and hundreds of thousands suffered
greatly from wounds, sickness, poverty, or from the losses or sufferings of their friends; and in which, also, hundreds of millions of
property were expended. Let us recount the losses and gains.
2. Great Britain, of course, gained nothing by the war. Hers
was wholly loss. The United States gained their political independence, -"a name and a place among the nations of the earth."
This was indeed a great boon, but the war brought with it a long
train of evils. Dr. Ramsay, of South Carolina, who wrote a history
of the revolution, soon after its occurrence, says as follows:
3. " On the whole, the literary, political, and military talents of
the United States have been improved by the revolution; but their
moral character is inferior to what it was. So great is the change
for the worse, that the friends of good order are loudly called upon to
exert their utmost abilities in extirpating the vicious principles and
habits which have taken deep root during the convulsion."
4. Voltaire had said, long before this time: "Put together all the
vices of ages, and they will not come up to the mischiefs and enormities of a single campaign." But if this is true of a single campaign,
-and who will doubt it?- how much more is it true of a series of
campaigns, like that of the American revolutionary war!
5. Before the revolution, and especially before the long and disastrous Indian wars, the people of the United States were an industrious,
sober, honest and religious people. A large proportion of them were
engaged in husbandry or mechanics. There was comparatively little
of merchandising or manufacture, and still less of useless speculating
and downright idleness.
6. An army always corrupts, not only its members, but the society
which holds it in its bosom. If this effect was less visible in the case
of the American army, made up as it was, for the most part, of its
own citizens, rather than hireling Hessians, yet let us remember
that even the American army contained many useless and viciotus
citizens, and that not all who enlisted virtuous, were discharged so.
7. The cause of education suffered greatly during the war. Colnmon schools, instead of being fostered by the government, the church,
or the family, as they always had been before, were not only neglected, but, in a great many instances, absolutely overlooked and suf.
fered to perish. The course of instruction in our colleges was sometimes suspended. Many a student became a soldier.

tion of irreligion. The revolution opened the door to infidelity in
two ways. First, by introducing foreign fashions, habits, and modes
of feeling, thinking, and acting; a practical infidelity. Secondly, by
introducing from England and France, but especially the latter, an
open opposition to Christianity.
9. The atheistical philosophy of Godwin, Rousseau, Voltaire and
others, was spread in the United States, during the revolution, with
a fearful rapidity. But there were infidel writers in our own country.
Ethan Allen's "Oracles of Reason" had already appeared. Thomas
Paine's "Common Sense," written to aid the revolution, with much
truth, had inculcated some error, and paved the way for his other and
more objectionable writings. The effect of all these evil influences is
yet felt in the country.
CHAPTER CXXXIV.
Debts of the United States.
1. THE war had involved the United States in a debt of forty millions of dollars.  Of this sum, eight millions of dollars were borrowed
of foreign powers. The rules of the confederation of 1777 empowered congress to carry on the war; but they had no power to provide
for its expenses. They could only recommend to the several states to
raise money for that purpose.
2. Accordingly, on the 30th of May, 1781, congress passed a
resolution requesting the several states to furnish their proportion
respectively of the eight millions of dollars of borrowed money.
They also appointed a committee to determine what proportion of
the money ought to be paid by each state.
3. It was proposed to the states that a duty of four per cent. on
all foreign goods imported into the United States should be paid,
and that the revenue arising therefirom should be applied to the payCXXXVI. - 1. What dclebt did the United States owe? Could congress provide for the

ment of the national debt, both foreign and domestic. The latter
was principally due to the officers and soldiers of the army.
4. All the states, except Rhode Island and New York, assented to
this proposal. But as these two states had a large share of the
public trade, their refusal to contribute to pay the public debt
defeated the whole plan; and the consequence was, that even the
interest of the national debt remained unpaid. The government
was exceedingly perplexed, and knew not, in such a case, what
to do.
5. Certain measures of Great Britain added to the embarrassment.
Instead of permitting a free trade with the colonies in the West
Irdies, she shut her ports there against our vessels; and congress,
of course, had no power to compel them to open them. And what
congress could not do, the different states were not disposed to
attempt, had they possessed the power.
6. Under these embarrassing circumstances, it was perfectly natural for those states which felt desirous of discharging their debts in an
honorable manner, to make the utmost exertion to do their part.
Massachusetts, in particular, resolved to bear her portion of the public.
burden, and proceeded to act accordingly.
7. The country was not, however, in a perfectly settled state.
There were some men in Massachusetts, who, though they had
been willing, in 1776, to go to war with Great Britain, rather
than submit to taxation without representation, were willing, in
1786, to go to war with the government; rather than pay their share
of the expenses which the contest with Great Britain had occasioned.
8. On the 22d of August, 1786, delegates from fifty towns, in the
county of Hampshire, met at Hatfield, and set on foot an opposition
to the burdens, as they called them, which were lying on the people.
The excitement soon spread to Worcester, Middlesex, Bristol and
Berkshire counties. Indeed, it did not stop in Massachusetts - it
extended to New Hampshire.
9. In some parts of Massachusetts, tumultuous assemblies, under
the specious namnes of conventions, were assembled, which obstructed
the proceedings of courts and other bodies. Daniel Shays, who
had been a captain in the revolutionary war, was considered as
the head of the insurgents; -hence the name "Shays' Insurrection."
10. In August, no less than fifteen hundred of these insurgents
assembled in Northampton. They took possession of the courthouse, and would not allow the courts to sit. In December, three
hundred of them, under Shays himself, acted a similar farce in
Springfield. In truth, the spirit of opposition to taxation was rife
everywhere in the states, and seemed to be on the increase.

thousand men was raised to sustain the courts and suppress the insurrection, and General Lincoln - the same man who had so much distinguished himself in the army of the United States -was appointed
to the chief command. The troops were raised for a service of only
thirty days.
12. One of the first directions to the new army, was to go to Worcester, and defend the courts there. In this they succeeded. Another
)bject was to defend the arsenal at Springfield. For this last purpose, twelve hundred mnen, under General Shepard, assembled at
Springfield; and, on the 24th of January, Shays, with eleven hundred
men, marched against them.
13. When the insurgents were within two hundred and fifty yards
of the arsenal, word was sent them not to come any nearer, for if
they did they would be fired on. Disregarding this, they advanced
one hundred yards further, upon which General Shepard ordered
his men to fire, but to direct the first shot over their heads. This
only quickened their approach. The artillery was then levelled
against them, and three of their number were killed and one
wounded.
14. Shays endeavored to rally his men, but in vain.   They
retreated first to Ludlow, and afterward to Peiham, where they again
assembled. General Lincoln, hearing of this at Hadley, marched
against them, in the midst of deep snow, and took one hundred and
fifty of them prisoners, and dispersed the rest.
15. Conditional pardon was now offered by the legislature of Massachusetts to all the rebels; of which seven hundred and ninety availed
themselves. Fourteen were tried and received sentence of death;
but were, one after another, finally pardoned. The rebellion was
at length suppressed, and the peace of the commonwealth restored
CHAPTER CXXXV.
Constitution of the United States.
1. WE have seen that a confederacy of the states was proposed,
during the first years of the revolutionary war, and signed by the thirteen states, in 1781. But experience at length seemed to show
that, how wisely soever it hlad been framed for a time of war,
it was not adequate to all the wants of the country in a time of
peace.
2. In January, 1786, a proposal was made by the legislature of
Virginia, for a convention of commissioners from the several states,
whose duty it should be to take into consideration the trade and
insurrection.  12. What did the army first attempt? What was antother object?  13.

commerce of the country, and either devise some plan for their regulation, or delegate to congress the power to legislate upon it; -in
other words, to revise the federal system.
3. Provision was made for holding such a convention in Annapolis
in the following September; but as there were delegates present at
that time from only five of the states, the subject was deferred to the
following May. In the mean time, new efforts were made to procure
a general attendance at that meeting.
4. In May, 1787, commissioners from all the states but Rhode
Island met at Philadelphia, and having chosen General Washington,
who was one of the delegates from Virginia, their president, they proceeded to the important business assigned them. Their whole number was fifty-five.
5. The question which first engaged their attention was, whether
to revise the old federal system, or formn a new one. The object for
which the convention had been originally appointed, was that of mere
revision. And yet the defects of the old system were such that it
was finally determined by the majority to form a new system.
6. The next thing was to agree upon the principles which should
form the basis of the new confederation. Here, in general, there was
much harmony of opinion at first. But when they came to the practical application of those principles, there was more of disagreement.
One point, in particular, upon which they could not soon agree, was
the formation of a national legislature.
7. It was a long time before all the members of the convention
were willing to have the members of the house of representatives be

in proportion to the whole number of free citizens in the states, and
three fifths of the others. And as to the senate, there was still
greater difficulty. The small states wished to be on an equal footing
with the larger ones; to which the latter were, of course, strongly
opposed.
8. When this last point had been agitated for a long time, and the
convention seemed about to adjourn without accomplishing its object,
Dr. Franklin, a member from Pennsylvania, then over eighty years of
age, in a speech which abounded in good sense, and was not wanting
in eloquence, proposed daily morning prayer.
9. This hint being well received, prayer was henceforth offered,
every day, before proceeding to business. From this time, there was
more and more of harmony in their deliberations, till at length a constitution was matured and signed by the members, and presented to
congress, who, forthwith, presented it to the several states for them
to consider and ratify.
10. It had been resolved by the convention, that state conventions
should be called to discuss the merits of the new constitution, and to
accept or reject it, as might seem to them best; and that congress
should carry it into effect as soon as it should be signed orratified by
nine of the states.
11. For a time, it was quite doubtful whether it would ever go
into operation. At length, however, it was ratified by eleven of the
states; North Carolina and Rhode Island alone, of the thirteen, refusing to accept it. They finally consented to receive it -the former in
1789, the latter in 1790.
12. All classes of people, whether federalists or not, -for by this
name the friends of the federal government were called,- now turned
their eyes toward Washington as their first president. On opening
the votes for chief magistrate of the United States, at New York,
March 3, 1789, it was found that George Washington was unanimously elected; anld that John Adams was chosen vice-president.
CHAPTER CXXXVI.
Proceedings of the First Congress.
1. WASHINGTON was inducted into his new office April 30, 1789,
in the presence of the first congress of the United States which convened under the new constitution. As soon as the ceremonies of the
inauguration were over, he entered the senate chamber and delivered

more remarkable than its frequent reference to a Supreme Being as
the Ruler of the universe, and Controller of human actions and human
destiny, whether individual or national. Then, "suiting the action
to the word," he and the members of both houses of congress attended
divine service almost immediately afterward.
3. Never was the business of a legislative body more pressing or
more important than that of this first congress of the United States.
Four prominent measures could not be delayed. There must be a
revenue; the various departments of government must be arranged
and filled; a judiciary department and its officers were needed; and
the public credit was, if possible, to be maintained.
4. To create a revenue and pay the public debt, foreign and domestic, and support the present government, it was decided that duties
should be laid on imported goods and merchandise, and on the tonnage
of vessels. A department of state, a treasury department and a war
departinent were created, and Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and Henry Knox placed at their heads respectively.

5. The power of removal from office, in the executive department, occasioned a good deal of discussion; but it was at length
decided that it should be left with the president alone.  Congress
adjourned September 29; but not till they had requested the president to recommend to the people a day of public thanksgiving and
prayer.
6. During the recess of congress, President Washington made a
tour through New England as far as Portsmouth, in New Hampshire,
with a view to observe the character, habits, &amp;c., of the people. He
was received, everywhere, with those marks of attention which indicated an entire confidence in his administration.
7. The second session of the first congress commenced January
8, 1790.  From   the report of Mr. Hamilton, secretary of the
treasury, it was found that the United States' debt was fifty-four million dollars, for the payment of all which he recommended adequate
provision.
8. No objection was felt, in congress, to paying the foreign
debt which had been incurred, now amounting, including interest,
to eleven million five hundred thousand dollars; but the question
of the full assumption, by congress, of all the rest of the debts,
including those contracted by the states, caused a long and anxious
debate
9. Congress, however, by a small majority, finally concluded to
pay the whole debt. In order to this, the money derived from the
sale of western lands was to be applied, together with what remained
of the revenue after paying the current expenses of the government.
It was also decided to borrow, at five per cent. interest, two million
dollars.
10. During the session, the state of Vermont, by consent of both
houses of congress, was received into the Union. The seat of general
government was fixed for ten years at Philadelphia, after which it was
to be removed to Washington. A tax was laid, after a long and angry
debate, on domestic spirits. A national bank was also established,
with a capital of ten million dollars, and a charter was granted to
extend to May, 1811.

CHAPTER CXXXVII.
Wars with the Indians.
1. THE discussion of so many great and important subjects at the
two sessions of the first congress had already formed a line of demarkation between the two great political parties, whose frequent
subsequent conflicts for power have more than once shaken the very
confederacy itself to its centre.
2. But while these things were going on at Philadelphia, a war
was preparing with the Indians of the north-west. By an ordinance
of congress, in 1787, a territorial government had been formed
north-west of the river Ohio; and, by another ordinance, power had
been given to commissioners to treat with the Indians. In spite,
however, of governments and treaties, an Indian war broke out in
1790.
3. On the 30th of September, General Harmar, with fourteen hundred and fifty men, three fourths of whom were Pennsylvania and
Kentucky militia, marched against the Indians at their villages, on the
Scioto and Miami rivers. The Indians, after setting fire to their huts
with their own hands, fled to the woods.
4. After burning and plundering and some skirmishing for several
days, a general and decisive battle was fought near the spot where

Chillicothe now stands, in which the army of the United States was
defeated, with the loss of nearly two hundred men. The loss of the
Indians, however, was considerable. They had lost also, during the
whole time, about three hundred huts and wigwams.
5. The success of the United States was greater, this year, in
making treaties with the Indians, than in fighting them. By the persevering exertions of General Knox, the secretary of war, a treaty
was made with the Creek Indians, in which a large territory, hitherto
claimed by that tribe, was ceded to Georgia.
6. After the failure of the expedition under General Harmar, General St. Clair was appointed to the command of the north-western
army, and additional troops were raised. He was also appointed governor of the north-western territory. He was instructed to carry on
the war against the Indians, by destroying their villages about the
Miami, and driving them wholly away from the Ohio country.
7. In the spring of 1791, he took the field with about fifteen hundred men. The Indians in that region had, as it was supposed, about
an equal number of warriors. Generals Wilkinson and Scott were
sent out with eight hundred and fifty men, but did not effect much.
Early in November, General St. Clair himself went against them with
his whole force.
8. On the 4th of November, a great battle was fought on the
Miami, in which the army of St. Clair was entirely defeated, with tlhe
loss of more than six hundred men - nearly half his army. This was
the most signally destructive battle which had been fought with the
Indians since the memorable defeat of Braddock.
9. But, instead of relinquishing the war, on account of a few
disasters, congress, after a good deal of discussion  and much
opposition to the measure, passed a bill to raise several new regiments of troops, to be employed in the service, if necessary, three
years.  
10. During the year 1791, Washington made a tour of observation through the southern states, as he had done through the
northern, two years before, and for similar purposes.  The day,
and in many instances the hour, of his appearance at each place,
was fixed long before his arrival, from which, except in a single
instance, he never deviated.  He was received everywhere with
demonstrations of great joy.

the fourteenth. It may be useful to trace the history of this state
from the earliest known periods, as well as the character of the individual who began its settlement.
2. The revolutionary war, though it retarded the progress of the
settlements in the west, did not wholly prevent emigration. In 1773,
no less than four hundred families passed down the Ohio river in six
weeks, most of whom settled at or near Natchez. The same year
three hundred families of Germans emigrated from  Maine to the
south-western parts of South Carolina.
3. But the most remarkable of all the attempts to people the
western country at this period was made by Colonel Daniel Boone,
of North Carolina. He was a great hunter, and had rambled in the
forests of the "mighty west" several years before he ventured, in
defiance of wild beasts and still wilder men, to take up his residence
there.
4. He first left home, in company with six other adventurers, in
1769. Kentucky was found to be a fine place for hunting the buffalo.
At length he and a companion, by the name of Stuart, were taken
prisoners by the Indians. They escaped from them and found their
way back to their camp, but it had been plundered, and the rest of
the company were dispersed.
5. Soon after this, his brother and another man joined him, so that
the company was again increased to four. Stuart was, soon after,
killed by the Indians, and the other man by wolves, so that Boone and
his brother alone rernmained. They, however, built themselves a cottage with poles and bark, and wintered there.

6. In May, 1770, the brother of Boone returned to North Carolina, in order to procure a recruit of horses and ammunition, leaving
him entirely alone, and, as hlie himself says, "without bread, salt or
sugar, or even a horse or a dog." This winter, in one of his
rambles, he narrowly escaped the savages. But he was one of
those men who, like Washington, seemed reserved for special purposes.
7. His brother returned to him late in July, and they spent the
rest of the year there, and the following winter. During this time,
besides hunting, they discovered and gave name to the principal
rivers of the country. The whole region seemed to them a paradise,
and, in March, 1771, they returned home to bring their families
there.
8. In September, 1773, they set out for Kentucky. Five other
families had been induced, by their representations, to join them.
Forty men also joined them at Powell's Valley, on the road. Soon
after this they were attacked by the Indians, and six of the party
slain, among whom was Boone's eldest son. Their cattle also were
scattered.
9. They retreated forty miles to a settlement on Clinch river,
where they left their families. From this time forth, for nearly two
years, Boone was employed in surveying the country and in building
roads and forts. Among the rest, they built a fort at a place which
they called Boonsborough.  He removed his family to the fort, in
June, 1775, about the timne of the battle at Lexington.
10. This is supposed to have been the first permanent settlement
in that state,- at that time a part of Virginia, -though two others
were made not far from the same time.   The wife and daughter of
Colonel Boone were, as he says, "the first white women that ever
stood upon the banks of Kentucky river."
11. But this settlement was not effected without great peril.
Several times did the Indians attack Boone's party during the journey from Clinch river to Boonsborough. Five of the company were
killed, and as many wounded. Others were slain after their arrival.
The daughter of Boone was even carried off by the savages, in 1776
but her father recovered her.
12. The whole life of this father of Kentucky is eventful and
interesting, but we must only add, here, that he remained in his
favorite state, though often much exposed and once taken a prisoner,
till 1798, when he removed, with a large train of relatives and friends,
to Missouri, where he spent his days in hunting and trapping. He
died in 1822, aged eighty-five years.

247SOCIETIES IN THE UTNITED STATES.
CHAPTER CXXXIX.
Societies in the United States.
1. THE year 1792 is distinguished for the formation of the Massachusetts Agricultural Society; an association which, by itself and its
auxiliaries, has, in the progress of half a century, done much for the
advancement of the United States in that which constitutes the real
wealth and happiness and greatness of a nation.
2. Up to this period, societies for the promotion of improvement,
physical or moral, had been little known among us. But an interval
of rest from war had led many at length to turn their thoughts to
mechanics, manufactures, agriculture, education, morals and religion.
3. It is worthy of remark that the rearing of mulberry trees and
silk-worms had succeeded so far, in Connecticut, that the Rev. Jason
Atwater, a minister in Branford, had a silk gown made for him
this year, at his own home. This was the first clergyman's sill
gown made in America. Silk stockings had been fabricated a little
before, and also silk handkerchiefs.
4. One of the first anld most curious societies, ever formed in this
country, was the Boston Society for encouraging Industry and employing the Poor. It was established about the year 1750, though it
continued but a few years. A large and handsome brick building
was erected in Boston, in connection with this society, for the linien
manufacture; the expense of which was paid by a tax on carriages
and other articles of luxury.
5. This society held its first anniversary in 1753, when a public
discourse was delivered by Rev. Mr. Cooper. In the afternoon,
about three hundred young female spinsters, decently dressed, appeared on the common, at their spinning wheels. The wheels were
placed regularly in three rows, of one hundred each, and a female was
seated at each wheel.
6. The weavers, also, of the city and its vicinity, appeared on the
common, cleanly dressed, in garments of their own weaving. One
of them, with his loom, was carried on the shoulders of the people,
attended by music; the music of the shuttle continuing along with.he rest. The crowd that attended to witness these novel but interesting spectacles was immense.
7. An association of Tradesmen and Manufacturers, of the town of
Boston, was formed in 1785. The Boston Mechanics' Association
was formed in 1795. The Delaware Society, for promoting American Manufactures, was instituted at Wilmington, in 1817; and the
Scotch loom came into Rhode Island the same year. The Maryland
Economical Association was formed at Baltimore, in 1819.

8. The American Bible Society was formed at New York, in
1816.  Delegates were present from thirty-two societies. It is,
moreover, a curious fact, that, in view of the want of Bibles in the
country, congress, in 1777, had ordered twenty thousand Bibles to be
imported.
9. But there had been societies for other purposes, in considerable
numbers, formed long before the year 1792 -the period to which we
are now arrived. There was a Society for propagating the Gospel in
New England, incorporated in 1649- for propagating the Gospel
among the Indians, in New England and elsewhere, in 1661, and the
Society for propagating Christian Knowledge among the Indians, in
1762.
CHAPTER CXL.
Washington's second Election and Admistration.
1. SooN after the opening of congress in 1792, an attempt was
made to show that Hamilton, the secretary of the treasury, was a dangerous man, aiming at the destruction of the liberties and rights of his
country; and hints to the same effect were even thrown out against
President Washington himself.
2. But, notwithstanding all these insinuations, in March, 1793,
Washington was unanimously reelected to the presidency, and Mr.
Adams was again chosen vice-president. Washington had at first
decided not to be again a candidate for this high office, but had at
length yielded his own wishes to those of the people.
3. A treaty was, this year, made with the Indians on the Wabash,
and the promise of a conference the next spring obtained of several of
the other tribes. In the mean time, however, the business of enlisting
soldiers for an exigency, which might, after all, require them, was
perseveriugly though slowly carried on, and the troops already in the
service were kept in a proper state of discipline.
4. Early in 1793, news reached America of a declaration of war,
by Great Britain, against France and Holland; and caused much
excitement. From the nature of the relation which had subsisted
between the United States and France during the late war, a majority
of the people sympathized stronuly with the French, and were as
obviously opposed to Great Britain.
5. The question, therefore, arose whether the United States should
espouse the cause of either party in the contest. This question was
finally decided by Washington and his council in the negative.
7. What other associations were formed? 8. What of Bible societies! 9. What
societies were there prior to this time?

chanics. There were only twelve laborers and a few mechanics in
the company-" forty-eight gentlemen and four mechanics," as the
historian informs us. All, moreover, were single men; not an organized family being among them.
8. They were commanded by Captain Christopher Newport, an
old and experienced navigator. After smoking the calumet, or pipe
of peace, with the natives, on the spot where Hampton now stands,
they proceeded slowly up a river, which, in honor of their king, they
called James River.
9. But although they began by smoking the pipe of peace, it
appears that some of the savage tribes, as they ascended the river,
showed signs of hostility. They had doubtless heard of the treatment of their brethren at the Roanoke river, twenty years before, as
will appear in the history of North Carolina; or perhaps they remembered the kidnappers of 1520.
10. At length the colonists came to a peninsula, some fifty miles
up the river, on its northern side, which they selected as a suitable
place on which to establish themselves. Here they landed and went
to work. The place was called Jamestown. It was now about the
middle of May.
Building houses at Jamestown.
11. The plan of government for the little colony had been prepared for the emigrants before they left England.    One of their first
etfbrts was to ratify, as it were, this constitution or form  of governmoent. The officers consisted of a council or board of seven persons,
firom whom they were to select a president, who was to act as chief
magistrate.

3DIFFICULTIES WITH GREAT BRITAIN.
Accordingly, on the 22d of April, President Washington issued a
proclamation, enjoining entire neutrality on the part of the United
States.
6. The revolution in France had commenced about the year 1789.
It seemed to have been brought on, or at least hastened, by the revolution in the United States. The new republic now recalled the
French minister to the United States, who had been appointed under
the king, and sent over Mr. Genet, in his stead. The United States,
moreover, had consented to receive a minister from the new republic,
should one be appointed.
7. The object for which Mr. Genet was sent over was to persuade
the United States to aid France in the war. He landed at Charleston,
South Carolina, and being kindly received by the constituted authorities, both on account of the dignity of his office, and the gratitude
which was felt towards the French nation, he boldly proceeded to do
that which he was not authorized to do.
8. He did not hesitate to enlist men, and to arm and fit out privateers, to cruise and commit hostilities against nations with whom the
United States were at peace. When any captures were made, he
allowed the French consul at Charleston to hold courts of admiralty
on them, and to try and condemn them, and authorize their sale.
9. All this was done, too, by Mr. Genet, before the American
government had recognized him as a minister. He had presumed on
a disposition to aid France without regard to consequences. Finding
that the Americans disapproved of his conduct, he endeavoredpartly, no doubt, in self-defence- to excite them to opposition against
their own government.
10. When congress met, in 1793, they approved of Washington's
proclamation, as well as of all his conduct in relation to France.
They also encouraged the president and his cabinet to urge the
French to recall Mr. Genet, and appoint a successor. Mr. Genet
was therefore recalled, and Mr. Fauchet appointed in his stead.
11. The last important event of the year 1793 was the resignation
of Mr. Jefferson, secretary of state, and the appointment of Edmund
Randolph as his successor. Mr. Randolph had been, for some time,
attorney-general of the United States, and had sustained the office
with singular ability.

in January, 1793, forbidding the exportation of corn to France, and
authorizing the seizure of neutral vessels found carrying it there. As
a consequence, many American vessels had been captured.
2. Additional instructions had also been given, in the November
following, to British ships of war and privateers, to take all such
vessels as were carrying provisions or other supplies to France or her
colonies. Great Britain, moreover, had failed to deliver up the western posts, according to the provisions of the treaty.
3. In view of these difficulties between the two countries, and the
uncertainty to what they might lead, congress, in 1794, passed bills
for laying an embargo for thirty days, for increasing the standing
army, and for organizing the militia and erecting fortifications. At
the same time that these precautionary measures were taken, Mr.
Jay was appointed an envoy extraordinary to the court of Great
Britain.
4. Mr. Jay succeeded, during this and the following year, in settling the difficulties between the two countries. This, while it met
the approbation of a majority of the people of the United States, only
increased the complaints of those who were opposed to the existing
administration, and widened the gulf which separated the two great
political parties.
5. The conference which had been promised by the Indians of the
north-west having failed, General Wayne, the successQr of General
St. Clair, was sent out against them, in August, 1794, who succeeded
in gaining a complete victory on the banks of the Miami, and in laying
waste their whole country.

who had been for some time meditating a great war against the people
of the United States, were discouraged by the sucecess of General
Wayne, and gave up their scheme, and hopes were now entertained
of a permanent peace with them.
CHAPTER CXLII.
The TWhiskey Insurrection.
1. CONGRESS, in 1791, had enacted laws imposing duties on spirits
distilled within the United States, and upon stills. To these laws
four or five counties in western Pennsylvania had, from the first, been
strongly opposed, but it was not till 1794 that their hostility broke
out in angry action.
2. But in July of this year, about a hundred persons, armed with
guns and other weapons, attacked the house of an inspector of the
revenue, and wounded some of the occupants. They also seized the
district marshal, and compelled him to agree not to persevere in the
duties of his office. Both the inspector and the marshal found it
necessary to leave the county for safety.
3. These and other similar outrages called forth a proclamation, on
the 7th of August, from President Washington, commanding the
insurgents to disperse, and warning all persons against aiding them
in any way whatever in their opposition. All officers and other citizens were also required to exert themselves to the utmost, to prevent
and suppress such dangerous proceedings.
4. On the 25th of September, a second proclamation was issued,
the object of which was to admonish the insurgents, and induce them,
if possible, to desist from their opposition. At the same time, however, the president declared his fixed determination, in obedience to
the duty assigned him by the constitution, "to take care that the laws
be faithfully executed," to compel the refractory to obedience.
5. Meanwhile, the insurgents, nothing daunted, proceeded to almost
every form of outrage. They first robbed the western mail. Next,
several thousands of them collected at Braddock's field, on the Monongahela. Still later, a convention of two hundred delegates, from
the disaffected counties of Pennsylvania and Virginia, met at Parkinson's Ferry, and by adjournment at other places.
6. Some were for returning to obedience, others adhered to their
opposition. At length, Washington ordered out fifteen thousand
militia, under Gov. Lee, of Virginia, on the approach of whom the
insurgents laid down their arms. Eighteen were tried for treason,

but not convicted. Only three men were killed during the whole
progress of the insurrection.
7. The only historical events of the year 1795, worthy of note,
were the ratification, by the senate of the United States, of Mr. Jay's
treaty with Great Britain, and the conclusion of treaties with the Dey
of Algiers, Spain and the Miami Indians. By the treaty with Algiers
a number of American citizens were liberated from a most painful
bondage.
CHAPTER CXLIII.
Tennessee- the sixteenth State.
1. IN 1796, Tennessee was admitted into the Union as the sixteenth state. It had been made a territorial government in 1790,
but the number of inhabitants which was necessary to entitle it to be
received into the confederacy was not sufficienlt till six years afterward.
2. What is now the great state of Tennessee, with almost a million of inhabitants, was, till about fifty years ago, a part of North
Carolina. The first settlement attempted to be made in the province
was in 1754. At that time, about fifty families settled on Cumberland river, where Nashville now stands, but were broken up soon
after by the Indians.
3. The first permanent inhabitants of Tennessee went there in
1757. They built Fort Loudon, now in Blount county. They were
attacked, in 1760, by the savages, and two hundred men, women
and children, were massacred. In 1761, the savages were humbled
by Col. Grant, and a treaty made with them, which encouraged
emigration.
4. In 1765, settlements began on the Holston river, and gradually
increased.  Still the Indians were troublesome, but were often
promptly repulsed, especially by Col. John Sevier, who was the Tennesseean hero of those times. In June, 1776, Col. Sevier, with the
militia of Tennessee, and a few soldiers from Virginia, gained a decisive victory over the savages.
5. Where Nashville now stands was a wilderness till 1780. During
that year, about forty families, under the direction of James Robertson, crossed the mountains, and founded Nashville. From this time
forward, though more or less harassed by the Indians, the progress of
the state, in population and improvement, was rapid.

state by the name of Franklin; but the scheme was at length abandoned. In 1789, North Carolina gave up the territory, and in 1790
congress recognized it as a separate province, and made provision for
its government accordingly.
CHAPTER CXLIV.
Washington's Resignation.
1. THE time for electing a chief magistrate was again approaching,
and Washington having signified his determination to retire to private
life, it became necessary to bring into the field a new candidate.
The most popular individual was John Adams, and, on opening and
counting the votes, in February, 1797, he was found to be elected.
Thomas Jefferson was, at the same time, chosen vice-president.
2. Two years before this time, there had been a considerable
change in the cabinet. Gen. Hamilton had resigned the office of
secretary of the treasury, and had been succeeded by Oliver Wolcott,
of Connecticut. Gen. Knox had also been succeeded, in the war
department, by Timothy Pickering, of Massachusetts.
3. No considerable change had taken place in the morals and religion of the community, during the administration of Washington,
notwithstanding his own manifestations of regard for good things.
The country was still flooded with vice and infidelity. The writings
of Paine and Godwin were circulated in great numbers -sometimes
gratuitously.
4. Trade and commerce, however, flourished, during this period,
beyond any former example.    In 1797, the exports of the United(
States amounted to nearly fifty-seven millions of dollars, and the
imports to seventy-five millions of dollars. Great progress was made
in agriculture, anid some in manufactures. The population of the
United States had risen to about five millions.
5. The national credit, moreover. had become established; an
ample revenue had been provided; a considerable part of the national
debt had been paid; and such measures had been put in operation as
bade fair to extinguish the debt in a reasonable time. Treaties had
been made with most of the Indian tribes, and peace with most foreign
nations.
6. A prodigious impulse had been given, during this period, to the
cause of education. Among the literary institutions which had their
origin during the short period of Washington's administration, were
Williams, Union, Greenville and Bowdoin colleges, and the University
of Vermont. The Historical Society of Massachusetts had its origin,
also, during the same period.

7. It was in the year 1795 that the remarkable school fund of
Connecticut was formed. The Connecticut reserve lands -now a
part of northern Ohio - were sold for one million two hundred thousand dollars, and devoted to this purpose. The fund now amounts
to two millions of dollars. In 1796, an act for establishing schools
throughout the state was passed in Pennsylvania.
8. No man ever had such unbounded influence inr the United States
as Washington- perhaps it is not too much to say, no man ever will
have. Several other chief magistrates have indeed been extremely
popular and influential, especially when they had been distinguished
in military life. Yet even these had not the hearts of the whole nation at their disposal like Washington.
9. Had he been as ambitious as Napoleon, or even as Bolivar, or
Francia, he might have been dictator for life, as well as they. Such
a course was even proposed to him, in 1782, when it was believed
that the country was not yet ready for anything but a qualified monarchy; but he turned from it with disdain. As the leader of a
republic, in a time which "tried mnen's souls," no one ever exceeded
him in judgment or patriotism.

encouraging, yet there was one drawback from the public felicity.
This was the perplexing character of our relations, as a government,
with France.
2. For a long time before this, France had been committing depredations on our West India commerce. In the hope of being able to
adjust, in an amicable way, the existing difference, Washington, just
before his retirement from office, had recalled Mr. Monroe, our minister at Paris, and appointed Gen. C. C. Pinckney in his stead.
3. The French republic refused to receive a new minister, till
after the "redress of grievances" of which they complained.  On
learning the fact, President Adams, in June, 1797, convened congress,
and in his address or message, though he spoke of preserving peace
if possible, yet, as a last resort, he alluded to war.
4. The result was that three envoys extraordinary to France were
appointed, to attempt a settlement of the existing difficulties.  They
were, Gen. Pinckney, Elbridge Gerry, and John Marshall. Their
mission finally proved an entire failure; and the spring of 1798
opened with every prospect of war.
5. Indeed, in a practical point of view, war was already begun.
The treaty existing between the two countries had, in July, 1797,
been declared by the United States as no longer binding on their part.
The French cruisers were continually making depredations upon our
commerce, and every opportunity was taken to insult the United
States government.
6. In these circumstances, the first step taken by congress was to
increase the regular army. Twelve regiments of infantry, one of
artillery, and one of cavalry, were ordered to be added to the existing
establishment; and the president was authorized to appoint such officers as might be necessary to render the army efficient.
7. For commander-in-chief. all eyes were once more turned towards Washington; and notwithstanding his love of retirement and
of domestic and agricultural life, he consented once more to comply
with the wishes of his country. But, by the merciful appointment
of Divine Providence, the danger of war suddenly disappeared.
8. The French government having expressed a willingness to settle
the difficulties which existed on reasonable terms, President Adams
appointed Oliver Ellsworth. Wm. R. Davies, and Wm. Vans Murray
envoys extraordinary to meet the commissioners of the French
They sailed for France in the summer of 1799.
9. On their arrival in France, they found a change in the government. All power was now in the hands of Napoleon, who had not
been concerned in the transactions about which so much difficulty
existed. A treaty of peace was made, Sept. 30, 1800; anid the army
of the United States was, by direction of congress, soon after dis
banded.

THE PUBLIC HEALTH.
10. Before the treaty was made, however, the commander-in-chief
of the newly raised American army was no more! He expired suddenly, at his seat at Mount Vernon, in Virginia, December 14, 1799,
in the sixty-eighth year of his age; and left a whole nation to mourn
his loss.
CHAPTER CXLVI.
The public Health.
1.!THE introduction of the kine-pox, or, as it was at that time
called, the cow-pox -or, in more fashionable language still, vaccination-into the United States, in the year 1800, is an event which
deserves to be remembered in our history. The individual to whom
the country is indebted for this act of benevolence is I)r. Benjamin
Waterhouse, of Cambridge.
2. Small-pox was first known in Europe about the time of the
discovery of America by Columbus; and, as might have been expected
on its first appearance in a country, was exceedingly fatal. From
Europe it was soon scattered among the inhabitants of the western
world, where it was also very fatal, especially among the Indians,
owing, in part, no doubt, to their wretched mode of treating it.
3. As early in the settlement of Massachusetts as the year 1631,
this terrible destroyer appeared among the natives at Saugus, and
swept away whole towns or villages. The colonists assisted, it is
said, in burying entire families of the Indians at once. In one of
their wigwams a living infant was found at the breast of its deceased
mother, every other Indian of the place being dead.
4. Again, in 1633 and 1634, the disease raged in the same fearful
manner. Holnes, in his "American Annals,'l says, that "thirty
of John Sagamore's people were buried by Mr. Maverick, of Winesemet, in one day." In 1692, it raged greatly in New Hampshire
among the colonists, having been brought there in bags of cotton from
the West Indies. Again, in 1700, it was fearfully prevalent in
Charleston, South Carolina.
5. The first notice we find of its appearance among the white
population of Boston is in the year/1689. In 1702, it was still more
prevalent and fatal. and swept off more than three hundred of the
inhabitants. Again it made great havoc in Boston and some of the
adjacent towns, in 1721. Inoculation for the disease was now for the
first time introduced.
6. The opposition which was manifested to the practice of inoculation is, at this day, hardly credible, were it not well attested.
Many thought that if a person who had been inoculated should die,

his physician ought to be treated as a murderer. Dr. Cotton Mather,
though not a little superstitious himself, labored in vain to remove the
vulgar prejudices on this subject.
7. Dr. Zabdiel Boylston was the first physician whom Dr. Mather
could persuade to stem the torrent of prejudice. He began by
inoculating his own family. The populace were so enraged, that his
family was hardly safe in his house, and he was often insulted in the
streets. And yet it was obvious that the inoculated disease was comparatively mild, and that but few died of it.
8. But the crowning discovery of all, as a preventive of this fearful
disease, was that of vaccination, by Dr. Jenner, of England, late in
the eighteenth century, and first made publicly known in 1796. Much
praise shlould be accorded to Dr. Waterhouse for his successful efforts
to introduce it in this country.
9. The yellow fever first prevailed within the present limits of the
United States at Philadelphia, about the year 1698, and swept off
great numbers of the people. It had, however. previously appeared
in the West Indies. In 1728, it was still more fatal in Charleston,
South Carolina. The physicians knew not how to treat it. Again
it raged in Charleston most fearfully in 1732.
10. In the year 1746, it prevailed among the Mohegan Indians, in
Connecticut, and about one hundred of them died of it. In 1793, it
was very fatal in Philadelphia, and again in 1797 and 1798. In the
latter year it raged also in New York, and, for the first time, in Boston. It prevailed in New Haven in 1794.
11. The cholera, a new and destructive disease, after having raged
greatly in the East, at length, in 1832, crossed to Canada, and advanrced, by way of Albany and New York, into the United States,
where it became, for several years, the principal epidemic disease.
It was much more suddenly fatal, as well as more severe, than common cholera morbus.
12. But the scourge of the United States, in every period of their
history, especially for a century past, has been the consumption.
With the progress of civilization and refinement, this disease has
increased, and is likely to continue to increase till the community can
be generally enlightened with regard to its numerous causes.

to a resolution of congress, ten years before, the seat of government
was this year transferred to Washington, in the District of Columbia.
A law was indeed passed, this year, establishing a national system of
bankruptcy, but it was repealed three years afterward.
2. There were also some changes made in the western territories
this year. A part of the north-western territory was separated from
the rest, to be called the Indiana Territory. The MAississippi Territory was also erected into a separate government. By the second
census, taken this year, the population of the United States was
found to be five million, three hundred and five thousand, four hundred and eighty-two.
3. On the 4th of March, 1801, Mr. Adams' term of office, as
president, having expired, and the measures of the federal party having become somewhat unpopular, Thomas Jefferson was elected in his
stead; and Aaron Burr was chosen vice-president. The contest was
long and severe; and, as there was no election by the people, the
choice for the first time devolved upon congress.
4. The method of election, in such cases, was first to be settled,
and was fixed upon as follows. The representatives of each state
were to be seated by themselves, and to ballot by themselves; each
state being entitled to only one vote. The doors were to be closed
against every person but the officers of the house; and, the balloting
having once commenced. the house was not to adjourn till a choice
was effected.
5. In the present instance, the representatives of the states were

12. We must not omit to notice the method of forming this irst
United States government. The London Company had selected the
council before the emigrants set out, but the names were carefully
put up in a box and concealed till the party should arrive in Virginia;
they were then to open it and organize themselves. A code of laws,
which had also been prepared by the Company, was to be at the same
time promulgated.
13. The names of the seven councillors were Bartholomew Gosnold, the navigator, John Smith, Edward Wingfield, Christopher
Newport, John Ratcliff, John Martin, and George Kendall. They
made choice of Mr. Wingfield for their president.
CHAPTER XI.
Weakness of the Colony.
1. WmHILE a part of the colonists were busy in clearing the soil
and building suitable huts and fortifications, Captain Newport, in
company with Captain John Smith, ascended the James rives to the
falls, and visited Powhatan, the chief of the Indians in those parts,
at his principal seat, just below where Richmond now stands. It was
a village of only twelve wigwams.
2. Captain Newport left the colony, about the middle of June, for
England. No settlemnent was ever left in a more pitiable condition
To say nothing of the danger from savage foes, their provisions were
poor and insufficient, the water was unwholesome, and the summer
heat intolerable to those who had been accustomed to a cooler climate;
many of them were sick, and those who were not sick were discouraged.
3. In less than a fortnight after the departure of the fleet, hardly
ten of them were able to stand up; nor so many as five were fit to
guard the fort, or plant crops for future sustenance. The sickness
increased, till, in some instances, three or four died in a night. Fifty
of them, or about half the colony, perished before autumn came on.
4. To complete the catalogue of evils, they quarrelled among.hemselves. They first excluded from the council Captain Smith,; (ofessedly on account of sedition, but really and truly from motives
l4 envy. Next they deposed Mr. Wingfield, the president, and appointed Mr. Rateliff in his stead, who was no better, and thus things,
for some time, went on.
5. They discovered, at last, that Captain Smith, whom they had so
much hated, was the best man among them, and their chief dependence.
In truth they could not do without him in peace or in war. Money,
with him, was not as with most men, and especially those of this colony, a main object: the good of his fellow-men was the higher motive
in his breast.

obliged to ballot thirty-six times before they could effect a choice.
At the first ballot, eight states had voted for Mr. Jefferson, six
for Mr. Burr, and two were divided. Of course, neither candidate
had a majority of the votes. At the thirty-sixth ballot, Mr. Jefferson had the votes of ten states, Mr. Blrr four, and there were two
blanks.
6. During the administration of Mr. Adams, agriculture, trade
and commerce, had continued to flourish, and religion had begun
to revive. Infidelity still stalked abroad, but had greatly altered
its tone. The good influence of religion upon society had begun
to be admitted, even by those who did not believe in its divine
origin.
CHAPTER CXLVIII.
The Settlement of Ohio.
1. IN 1802, the eastern part of the northwestern territory was
admitted to the Union as an independentstate, by the name of
Ohio. There were now seventeen states in the Union. At the
time of its reception, Ohio contained seventy-two thousand inhabitants.
2. It was first permanently settled at Marietta, in the year 1788.
This was a year famous in the history of western emigration; for
no less than twenty thousand persons- men, women and children-passed the mouth of the Muskingum      river, during the
season, on their journey down the Ohio. The party which stopped
at Marietta consisted of forty-seven persons, under General Rufus
Putnam.
3. Their first business was to build a stockade fort, of sufficient
strength to resist the ordinary attacks of the savages. They killed
the standing trees by cutting the bark, taking care, however. to
hew down enough of them to admit of their planting fifty acres of
corn. In the autumn, twenty more families joined them. Both of
these companies were New England people.
4. The Indians, for many years, gave the settlers of Marietta but
little trouble. Nor did the latter make war upon or molest the
Indians, except in one or two instances. Twice, some of the more
thoughtless of the settlers fired upon the Indians, when they came
too near them, by which means one Indian was killed and another
wounded.

acres of corn were soonI planted, and, for food, they shot down game
and caught fish. They ground their corn in hand-mills. Their garments were chiefly of their own manufacture.

verted Indians, from Pennsylvania, formed on the Muskingum river
about fifteen years earlier; but after the lapse of a few years, they
were gradually broken up, and the remnant were massacred, some
time after.
7. Until the year 1795, there was much difficulty in settling this
state, on account of the Indian wars. But after the victory over
the Indians, by General Wayne, during the administration of Washington, the population increased very rapidly, and continued to
increase, till, in 1840, it contained about a million and a half of
inhabitants.
CHAPTER CXLIX.
Burr and Hamilton.
1. AT the first session of congress after the election of Jefferson,
the system of internal taxation, which had been introduced during
Adams' administration, was repealed, as well as several other
laws which the new administration did not approve. Many public
officers, who were strongly attached to'the old order of things,
were removed to make way for those who were of a different political
character.

of Indian lands were also ceded to the United States this year.

Hamilton.
3. In July, 1804, a duel was fought by Aaron Burr, vice-president of the United States, with Alexander Hamilton, late secretary
of the treasury, and a distinguished officer of the revolutionary war,
in which the latter was killed at the first fire. The duel took place
on the New Jersey shore, opposite New York.
4. The death of Hamilton produced a very strong sensation in
the United States. He was unquestionably one of the ablest men
of his political party in the country. But, like many otherwise good
men, he was misled by a false notion of honor; and, in an evil hour,
consented to take a step which he was too proud to retrace. Few
men have been more lamented.
5. Jefferson was reelected, and again took the oath of president
of the United States, March 4, 1805. George Clinton, of New York,
was chosen vice-president. This office he held by reelection till his
death, which happened in April, 1812.
6. The following anecdote will show the character of Vice-President Clinton. At the close of the revolutionary war, a British
officer, in New York, for no crime worthy of notice, was about to
the death of Hamilton 1 5. Who were elected president and vice-president 7 6. Relate

be tarred and feathered. With a drawn sword in his hand, Clinton
rushed in among the mob, and, at the hazard of his own life, rescued
the officer.
CHAPTER CL.
War with Tripoli
1. DURING the year 1805 - the first of President Jefferson's second
term - a war broke out between the United States and Tripoli,
which, more than almost any other historical event of that period,
deserves a particular notice.
2. For many years the inhabitants of the northern states of
Africa had been known as pirates, and the United States, as well as
other nations, had suffered greatly from their depredations. The
Tripolitans, in particular, had been very troublesome. Many of our
vessels had been boarded and plundered; and the crews, in some
instances, had been carried into a captivity worse, if possible, than
death.
3. To protect our commerce, as well as to humble the pirates, an
armed naval force, under Commodore Preble, had been sent out to
the Mediterranean as early as 1803. In the same year the Philadelphia frigate, under Captain Bainbridge, had joined him, but, in
ohasing a piratical vessel, had run aground and surrendered, and the
captain and his crew had been reduced to captivity.

4. After the surrender of the Philadelphia, the Tripolitans got the
vessel afloat, and moored her in the harbor. While lying there, Commrnodore Decatur, then only a lieutenant under Commodore Preble,
formed a plan to destroy her, to which, as it required but twenty men
and a single officer, the commodore consented.
5. To accomplish his purpose, Decatur sailed, under cover of the
night, in a Tripolitan vessel he had captured, for the Philadelphia,
taking with him an old pilot, who understood perfectly the Tripolitan language. On approaching the Philadelphia, they were hailed;
upon which the pilot answered that he had lost his cable and
anchor, and only wished to fasten his vessel to the frigate till
morning.
6. The request was refused, but they were permitted to remain
near the Philadelphia till the Tripolitans could be sent ashore to ask
permission of the admiral. As soon as the boat had put off, Decatur
and his men leaped on board, and in a few minutes cleared the deck
of fifty Tripolitans. They then set the frigate on fire, and returned,
in the light of it, to their squadron.
7. The plan was as successful as bold. Not a man was lost,
and only one injured. This individual was wounded in defending
Decatur. The latter, in a struggle with a Tripolitan, had been disarmed, and was about to have his head smitten off with a sabre, when
the seaman reached out his arm and received the blow, and thus
saved him.

23Bainbridge and his crew, and their companions in bondage, were
represented, at home, as great beyond endurance, and the public sentiment was in favor of continuing the war.
9. At this juncture, General Eaton, who had been consul of the
United States up the Mediterranean, and was at Egypt on his
return homeward, heard of the situation of his countrymen at Tripoli. He also fell in, at this time, with Hamet, the rightful heir to
the throne of Tripoli.   Jussuf, the third son of the reigning
bashaw, to gain the throne, had just murdered his father and
elder brother, and sought to destroy Hamet, the only surviving heir
in his way.
10. General Eaton was much interested in the story of Hamet, as
well as affected by the sufferings of his enslaved countrymen. The
beys of Egypt, too, were in favor of Hamet. A league was therefore
made between Eaton and Hamet, by virtue of which Hamet was to be
restored to his throne, and the American captives were to be released
from their bondage.
11. Having procured a small number of Americans and a few
soldiers from Egypt, General Eaton and Hamet crossed the desert
of Barca and took Derne, the capital of a large province of Tripoli.
The cause of Hamet had, by this time, become so popular, and their
force so stronIg, that they were about to attack Tripoli; which Jussuf
erceiving, was glad to make peace with the American consul, Mr.
ear.
12. This treaty, while it released the captive Americans, did not
restore Hamet to his throne. The latter visited the United States, in
1805, to solicit some remuneration for the services he had rendered
Genieral Eaton, and for the losses he had sustained by the premature
treaty of peace, as he deemed it, made by Mr. Lear; but conrgress
did not see fit to grant his request.
CHAPTER CLI.
Burr's Conspiracy.
1. ONE of the most remarkable events of the year 1806 was the
conspiracy, as it was called, of the late Vice-President Burr. After
the death of General Hamilton, he had retired to a small island in the
Ohio river, about two hundred miles below Pittsburg, since called
Blainerhasset's island.
2  Here he had set on foot a project for forming an independent
empire, west of the Allegany Mountains, of which he was to be
the chief or emperor. New Orleans was to be the capital. The
government of the United States, apprized of his plan, arrested
of Captain Bainbridge and his men? 9. What of General Eaton? Who was Hamet

him, brought him to Richmond, in Virginia, and put him on trial for
treason; but he was released for want of proof against him.
3. He found, moreover, that, beside the danger of being taken ana
convicted before he could get his scheme fairly "under way," the
attachment of the western states to the general government was
stronger than he had before supposed, and that his cunning and intrigue would not avail him.
4. It had been Burr's purpose, in case of the failure of his main
plan, to proceed, with such forces as he could raise, to Mexico, and
establish an empire there. But this restless man died, after all, without accomplishing the objects to which his ambition had prompted
him; and all the kingdoms which his imagination had reared descended to the grave with him.
5. In point of talent, Burr was certainly a remarkable man. It
was his unbounded ambition and unrestrained selfishness that ruined
him. Had he aimed, like Washington, at the general good of his
country, rather than his own aggrandizement, his memory might
as well have been associated with the latter, as with Benedict
Arnold.
6. It was about this period that President Jefferson directed Lewis
and Clark to explore the Missouri river, who, with a company of
forty-five men, proceeded to its source, and then descended on the
Columbia to. the Pacific Ocean, and returned the same way, - traversCLI.-1. Where had Burr retired? 2. What was his plan? What of his trial?

ing a distance of some ten or twelve thousand miles of wilderness in
little more than two years and four months. About the year 1806,
General Pike also explored the Mississippi.
CHAPTER CLII.
Troubles with Great Britain.
1. iN 1807, Great Britain and France being at war with each
other, the controversy drew to one side or the other most of the European powers; and there were not a few who would gladly have
involved the United States in the quarrel. As yet, however, the government was determined, if possible, to remain neutral.
2. One serious difficulty, indeed, had arisen. Great Britain, having
at her command a powerful navy, claimed the right of taliing her own
native-born subjects wherever she could find them. In pursuance of
her purpose, many vessels belonging to the United States had been
searched, and many individuals on board of them were seized and
retained as British subjects.
3. As it was not always easy to distinguish American from British
subjects, this custom of impressment gave great offence to the Americans. Thousands of our seamen, it was said, were claimed by the
British, and, in this way, forced into their service; and, as if to continue and aggravate, instead of trying to remove the grievance, Great
Britain would not so much as attempt any measures of redress.
4. Worse than even this difficulty took place; for, by an order in
council of the British government, issued May 16, 1806, declaring all
the ports and rivers, from the Elbe in Germany, to Brest in France,
in a state of blockade, American vessels trading to any of these ports
were liable to be seized and condemned..5. This decree of Great Britain was followed, in November, by
one from Bonaparte, at Berlin, in which all the British islands were
declared to be blockaded, and all intercourse with them was thus
broken up. This decree stood directly opposed to the existing treaty
between France and the United States, and also to the laws and
usages of nations.
6. Again, the British government, in January, 1807, issued another
order in council, forbidding all the coasting trade with France, on
penalty of capture and condemnation. Nothing could have been better
calculated than these proceedings to awaken every latent feeling of
resentment in the Americans against the two nations, if not to involve
them in all the horrors of war itself.

~CSATTACK ON THE CHESAPEAKE.
CHAPTER CLIII.
Attack on the Chesapeake.
I. SOME time in the beginning of the year 1807, five men had deserted from the British frigate Melampus, lying in Hampton Roads;
and three of them had subsequently enlisted on board the United
States' frigate Chesapeake, then at Norfolk, preparing for sea. The
British consul at Norfolk, on being acquainted with the facts, wrote
to Commodore Barron, of the Chesapeake, requesting that the men
might be returned.
2. This request being refused, the British consul applied to the
secretary of the navy to surrender them. The secretary ordered an
examination of the facts, from which it appeared that the men were
natives of America, of Which two of them had official certificates.
They were not, therefore, given up.
3. The Chesapeake had been ordered to cruise in the Mediterranean, and, on June 22, she proceeded on her voyage thither. In
going out of Hampton Roads, she passed the British frigates Bellona
and Melampus. As she was passing Cape Henry, the Leopard,
another British frigate, of fifty guns, came up with her, and an officer
was sent on board with a note.
4. This note enclosed a copy of an order from the British admiral,
Berkley, requesting them to search for deserters on board all our
ships found out of the limits of the United States. At the same time
a demand was made to be permitted to search the Chesapeake for the
deserters from the Melampus.
5. Commodore Barron, in reply, said, that he did not know of any
deserters on board; that the recruiting officers for the Chesapeake
had been particularly instructed not to receive any deserters from his
Britannic majesty's ships, and that he was directed never to permit
the crew of a ship under his command to be mustered by any officers
but her own.
6. Upon receiving this answer, the officer returned to the Leopard,
when she immediately commenced a heavy firing upon the Chesapeake. The latter, being unprepared for an action, could make no
resistance, but, after remaining in the fire of the Leopard about thirty
minutes, and having three men killed and eighteen wounded - the
commodore among the rest - she surrendered.
7. The British captain refused to accept the surrender of the
Chesapeake, but commenced a search, and finding the three men on
board whom they claimed to have been deserters, together withl a
fourth, whom they also claimed on the same ground, they took them
along with them. The Chesapeake, being much injured, returned to
Norfolk.

give a more particular account of him- his birth, education, ard

Captain John Smith making treaties w7vith the Indians
1. THIS most remarkable man of all the first settlers of Jamestown,
was born in Lincolnshire, England, in 1579. He was put as an apprentice to a merchant, at the age of fifteen, but, dislikling the business, he
left his master, proceeded to Holland, enlisted for a time as a soldier,
and at length found his way to Austria.
2. Here he entered the Austrian army, then engaged in a war with
the Turkls. After many singular adventures, and not a few hazardous
exploits in single combat- having, in three several instances, cut off
the heads of his antagonists -he was at length wounded, taken prisoner, and, on his recovery, sold as a slave.
3. In this situation he conducted so well as speedily to win the
confidence of his new mistress, who, with a view to restore to him his
freedom, sent him to her brother, an officer at the Crimea in Russia.
Here, contrary to her expectations, he was put to the severest drudgery, and his life made a burden.
4. Determined to escape from his new master, he at length found
a convenient opportunity.  He was emnployed at threshing, about
three miles from the house. Here his master visited him once a day.

8. On receiving information of this outrage, the president, by a
proclamation, ordered all armed British vessels to leave the waters of
the United States, and not to enter them more until satisfaction was
given by the British governmnent for the assault on the Chesapeake.
An armed force was also ordered out, sufficient for the defence of
Norfolk, should it become necessary.
CHAPTER CLIV.
Embargo laid.
1. THE next thing done by the United States government was to
forward instructions to Mr. Monroe, the minister at Lonldon, to denland
of the British government that satisfaction which the particular case
of the Chesapeake required, as well as security against further impressment of seamen from American ships.
2. The British were ready to enter upon negotiations respecting
the attack on the Chesapeake, but were unwilling to relinquish the
right of search. The result was that the discussion of the subject
was delayed. In the mean time, congress came together, when the
capture of the Chesapeake was one of the fifst subjects which occupied their attention.
3. Several measures were adopted at this session of congress;
among which were preparations and appropriations for the support of a large land and naval force. On the 22d of December,
1807, an embargo was laid on all vessels within the jurisdiction of
the United States. Meanwhile, the difficulties with both the British
and French governments were increasing, and a speedy war seemed
inevitable.
4. At length, Mr. Rose, a special minister from the British government, arrived in the country, and negotiations were once more
attempted. But they did not succeed: nor was the controversy,
which grew out of the attack on the Chesapeake, finally settled till
some time in the year 1811. In the mean time, Thomas Jefferson
had been succeeded in his office by James Madison.
5. The prospects of the country, when Mr. Madison came into
office, were gloomy indeed. The two great nations of England and
France were still at war, and, in the progress of that war, by their
orders and decrees and impressments and seizures, were breaking in
upon all former treaties, especially those with the United States.

readiness to settle the existing differences between the two countries,
the embargo had been repealed on the first of March. Finding, however, that there was still a disposition to delay, the embargo was, on
the 10th of August, renewed.
7. Thus affairs proceeded for some time. Decrees and prohibitions
and proclamations became quite the order of the day. Sometimes,
indeed, there was a gleam of hope. The probability that the United
States could long remain neutral, in the existing state of things, was,
however, every day and every hour diminishing.
8. On the 16th of May, 1811, the British sloop of war, Little Belt,
commanded by Captain Bingham, made an unprovoked attack upon
the United States' frigate President, commanded by Commodore
Rodgers; in the conflict which followed, the Little Belt had eleven
men killed, and twenty-one wounded, and her rigging much damrnaged,
while the President had only a single man wounded.
9. On the 12th of November, the British envoy, Mr. Foster, acknowledged the attack on the Chesapeake to be unauthorized, and
offered, in the name of the British government, to make reparation
for the injury whichl had been sustained. The whole affair was soon
adjusted to the satisfaiction of both parties.
CHAPTER CLV.
Steamboat Navigation in the United States.
1. STEAMBOATS were first used on the Hudson in the year 1807.
An event so closely connected with the prosperity of the United States
must not be excluded from their history.
2. An experiment had been made, with the steam-engine, on the
Seine, near Paris, in 1803; but no vessel was set in motion by steam,
in the United States, till four years afterward. The two individuals
most concerned in the work of introducing steamboats, were Fulton
and Stevens. They were not introduced into Great Britain till 1812
-five years afterward.
3. The first steamboat on the western waters was launched at
Pittsburg, in 1813. She was of four hundred tons burthen, and was
called the Vesuvius. She was built to run as a regular trader between the falls of the Ohio and New Orleans. A steamboat first
ascended the Arkansas river in 1820.
4. Such was the popularity and such the success of these boats,
especially in the western waters, that, in 1822, nine years after the
building of the Vesuvius, no less than eighty-nine steamboats were

enrolled at the port of New Orleans, forming, in the aggregate, something more than eighteen thousand tons. The Arkansas river had
even been ascended by steamboats five hundred miles.
5. The first steam-ship sailed for Europe in May, 1819. In 1840,
there were two regular lines of steam-packets plying between the
United States and Europe; one from Boston, and the other from New
York. At first, ten or twelve miles an hour was thought to be sufficiently rapid; now, the Atlantic is crossed in twelve days.
6. The whole number of steamboats, in the different states of the
Union, in 1840, was estimated at about eight hundred, with a capacity
of one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred and sixty tons.
Of these eight hundred boats, one hundred and thirty-seven were built
in the year 1837. The number of steam-engines, of all kinds, in use,
was estimated at about three thousand.
7. It should not be forgotten that, among the foregoing steam-vessels, some twelve or fourteen belong to the navy. The first steamfrigate for the navy was built many years since, but it is only within
a very few years that the number has been much increased.

CHAPTER CLVI.
Battle of Tippecanoe.
1. IN the year 1811, congrress assembled on the 5th of November
Not only the president's message, but all the proceedings, indicated
the expectation of a rupture with Great Britain at no distant period.
For though reparation had been made in the case of the Chesapeake,
the orders in council remained in full force.
2. During this year, the Shawanese and other Indians about the
Wabash river, in the territory of Indiana, became troublesome. Governor Harrison, with twelve hundred men, three hundred and fifty of
whom were regular troops, proceeded from the neighborhood of Vin
cennes to the Prophet's town, as the residence of their chief was
called, to demand satisfaction of the Indians.
3. The troops commenced their march September 26, and nothing
of importance occurred until their arrival on the line of the enemy's
country. Here they built a fort, which, in honor of their commander,
they called Fort Harrison.  At this place they remained about a
month, during which time the Indians very frequently came into the
camp and held councils with Governor Harrison, but would not accede
to his terms.
4. UJnder the circumstances, it was resolved to attack them; and,
with this view, the troops left Fort Harrison, October 29, and arrived
at the Prophet's town November 6. When they were within half
a mile of the town, they formed the line of battle, which the Indians
perceiving, sent in a flag of truce, saying that if their lives might
be spared till next morning, they would come to the governor's
terms.
5. This was a device of the savages to gain time, and put their
enemies off their guard. It was butt too successful; and, unsuspiciotus
of danger, our troops encamped where they were. Many of them,
strange as it may seem, slept as quietly all night as if they had been
at home in the midst of their families.
6. A little before five o'clock, next morning, the savages came
upon them with such fury that the sentinels could only fire a single
gun before they were in the very midst of the camp. Some of the soldiers were prepared, but others had to struggle with them at their very
tent doors.
7. The battle soon became severe, and the Indians, encouraged(
by the surprise into which they had thrown the troops at the first
onset, pressed forward in great numbers. The result of the contest,
for a long time, was doubtful. The bravery and skill of our troops,
however, prevailed, and the Indians began to give way; shortly

after this, they fled to a swamp, where they could not be followed.
8. The victory over them was dearly bought.  Sixty of the United
States' troops were killed, and one hundred and twenty-eight
wounded. Among the slain were several able and valuable officers.
The loss of the savages was great, but the number could not be exactly ascertained.
9. The next day, the troops set fire to the Prophet's town, and,
having destroyed everything valuable they could find, they returned
to Vincennes, after a fatiguing campaign of about two months. The
defeat of the Indians, however, was decisive. They gave the settlers
in that vicinity no more trouble for some time.
CHAPTER CLVII.
War declared with Great Britain.
1. THE difficulties with Great Britain were not removed. That
government still insisted on the right of impressment, as it was called;
the blockade of her enemies' ports incommoded us; and though the
French decrees of Berlin and Milan were repealed, the British had not
as yet annulled their orders in council.
2. An embargo was laid, on the 3d of April, by the president, at
the recommendation of congress, to continue ninety days, on all vessels within the jurisdiction of the United States. This was the prelude to war with Great Britain, which was declared on the 18th of
June following.
3. The bill for the declaration of war did not pass, however, without opposition. Forty-nine, out of one hundred and twenty-eight of
the representatives, entered their solemn protests, in which they denied
the war to be either necessary or just. Indeed, it only passed the
senate by a small majority.
4. Nor was the measure very well received by the people after the
bill passed. The editors of several newspapers, in different parts of
the country, were very decided in their expressions of disapprobation;
so much so as to provoke the violence of the war party and cause mobs
and riots.
5. The most remarkable of these mobs was at Baltimore. The
rioters first tore down the printing-office of the paper which had
offended them. The editor and others undertook to defend themselves with arms. The military force of the city was finally called
out. The conflict was severe, and was continued for two or three
nights; General Lingan was killed and several were wounded.

274GENERAL HULL'S SURRENDER.
6. So poorly prepared was the country for war, and so difficult
was it found io enlist soldiers, that a demand was made by the president on the governors of the states to furnish men from the militia of
their several states, to guard their ownI seaboard. But this, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island refused to do.
7. The grounds of this refutsal were, that the militia, if sent under
the call of the president, would be subject to the officers of the regular
army, and might be marched into Canada, or to any other part of the
country; and this, it was contended, was not agreeable to the constitution.
8. This refusal produced a great sensation throughout the United
States, but was fully justified by a large majority of the people of the
several states which thus withheld their militia from the demand of
the general government. It was generally condemned, however, by
the other portions of the country.
CH-IAPTER      CLVIII.
General Hull's Surrender.
1. WE have seen that a part of the states refused to call out their
militia at the request of the president. Connecticut, however, proceeded to raise troops for her own defence, and to organize and station
them, at various points along the coast, in her own way.
2. It was also found difficullt to enlist regular troops, and, still
more so, to find suitable officers for them. The few already in the
service, and such as could be readily enlisted, amounting to two thousand, were sent away to the north-west, and placed under General
Hull, an aged man who had served in the war of the revolution, and
who was at this time governor of Michigan Territory.
3. General Hull, with his troops, was ordered to Detroit, to garrison the fort there, and protect the country from the incursions of the
British and Indians. He arrived early in July, and having put everything in a posture of defence, he crossed the river Detroit, July 12,
and made preparations to invade Upper Canada.
4. But, instead of invading Canada, or even attacking a single
post, he remained there till the 7th of August, and then returned,
with his army, in the.light, to Detroit. After a few slight battles
and a good deal of skirmishing, he surrendered his army, August 16,
with the fort of Detroit, and all the neighboring forts and garrisons,
to the British, under General Brock.

cast a gloom over the whole country. General Hull was everywhere regarded, whether justly or unjustly, as either a coward or
a traitor.  Having been exchanged, soon afterward, for thirty
British prisoners, he was subsequently tried by a court-martial
and sentenced to death; but, on account of his age, he was recommended to the mercy of the president, who finally pardoned
him.
6. Genera] Hull was tried for three things, treason, cowardice,
and unofficer like conduct. On the first charge, the court-martial
which tried him did not give an opinion; but he was found guilty on
the other two. He was, most evidently, unfit to commnand an army,
whether by reason of age alone, or from other causes, and ought never
to have been charged with so important a trust
CHAPTER CLIX.
Capture of the Guerriere and the Alert.
1. WHILE the war was commenced so unhappily on land, it was
far otherwise on the sea. For, though Lord Nelson and others, by
their skill, had rendered Great Britain the mistress of the ocean, she
was yet to be humbled by a power whose naval force she could no'
help despising for its insignificancy.

2. The United States, at the opening of the war of 1812, had
three frigates of forty-four guns each, three of thirty-eight, five of
from twenty-eight to thirty-six, and nine sloops, varying from twelve
to eighteen guns. These twenty vessels constituted her whole naval
armament; and even of these, one was on Lake Ontario, and two
were unfit for sea. The British fleet consisted of from eight hundred
to one thousand ships.  
3. Commodore Rodgers, with his little fleet, the President, the
Essex, and the Hornet, lay at New York when war was declared.
Within an hour after he heard the news, he and the Hornet were
under way. On the 23d of June, only five days after the war was
declared, he fell in with and attacked the British frigate Belvidera, of
thirty-six guns, but she escaped.
4. This, however, was only a beginning. The Constitution, of
forty-four guns, commanded by Captain Isaac Hull, sailed from the
Chesapeake Bay about the middle of July. She was soon chased by
the British, and the chase continued, with some firing, for several
days; but the Constitution succeeded in escaping.
5. Meanwhile, the Essex, commanded by Captain, afterwards
Comrriodore Porter, which was not ready for sea when Commodore
Rodgers attacked the Belvidera, having made the necessary repairs,
sailed, and, after having taken several prizes, on the 13th of August
fell in with the British sloop of war Alert, of twenty guns, which she
took, after an action of only eight minutes.

6. This was the first armed vessel.which was taken by the Americans during this war.  It was not surprising that a frigate of
thirty-two guns should vanquish a sloop of twenty; and yet it was
not expected by our sailors that a vessel of the size of the Alert
would make so feeble a resistance. The Essex was not injured, nor
a man hurt; while the Alert was greatly crippled, and had three men
wounded.
7. This naval battle was fought three days before General Hull's
surrender. Three days after the surrender, another event took place
which was still more remarkable, both with respect to its character
and the final results, than the former. It was the capture of the
British fiigate Guerriere.
8. On the 19th of August, the Constitution came up with this
frigate, commanded by Captain Dacres, of thirty-eight guns, about a
thousand miles eastward of New England, and in two hours made her
a complete wreck; so much so, that it was thought best to destroy
her.
9. The loss of the Constitution, in this contest, was seven killed
and seven wounded; while the Guerriere had fifteen killed and sixtythree wounded. The Constitution was not at all injured; but was
ready for another action the very next day. Yet the force of the
American frigate was but little more than that of the enemy.
10. These brilliant events at sea had some effect to make up for
the losses on land. Besides, they encouraged our navy. It had been
thoutght, for some time, that nothing could vanquish the British -
force for force; but it now began to be thought otherwise
CHAPTER CLX.
Attack on Queenstown.
1. As early as the 1st of October, 1812, eight or ten thousandc
men, with military stores, were collected at various points along the
Canadian line, chiefly, however, in three great divisions - the northwestern, the eastern and the northern armies. Measures had also
been taken for arming vessels on the three lakes, Erie, Ontario aind
Champlain.
2. The north-western army was commanded by General Harrison,
and was stationed in the neighborhood of Detroit. The central division was directed by General Stephen Van Rensselaer, and stationed
at Lewiston, just below Niagara Falls. The army of the north, under
Major General Henry Dearborn, who was also commander-in-chief,
was at Greenbush and Plattsburg.

at Lewist(n succeeded in crossing the Niagara to Queenstown, and in
taking possession of the battery on the heights. But they were not
able to maintain their position, for they were only a few hundreds,
and most of the men at Lewiston were militia, and refused to follow
them, as they had promised to do.
4. The commander of the heights, Colonel Van Rensselaer, was
now in a most perilous situation. He had indeed already repelled one
attack from six hundred British regulars, and killed General Brock,
their commander. But General Sheafe, his success6r, renewed the
attack with an increased force, and the Americans were at length
compelled to surrender.
5. Nothing could have been more unexpected than the refusal
of the American militia to cross the Niagara. They had but just
before been urgent for the battle, andnow they utterly refused to embark.
6. General Brock was much lamented by the inhabitants of Canada, and a beautiful monument was erected to his memory, on the
heights of Queenstown, where he fell. An attempt was made, a few
years since, to destroy this monument; and, though it was not quite
successful, the monument was seriously injured. The villains were
never discovered.
7. The attack on Queenstown was followed, in November, by a
few bullying efforts, above the falls, on the part of General Smyth.
He was the successor of General Van Rensselaer - the latter having
resigned. He sent two detachments across, in the night, to Black
Rock; but they accomplished very little. The troops soon went to
winter quarters, and Smyth, being hissed from the army, went home
to Virginia.
8. Thus ended the war against Canada for that year. Never,
perhaps, was less accomplished, under circumstances so favorable,
than was done by the Americans, in this campaign of 1812. On the
26th of September, they had a force of thirteen thousand men on
the frontier. more than six thousand of whom were regulars; while
the British could scarcely muster three thousand troops on their whole
line, from west to east.

Watching his opportunity, Smith despatched him with the flail, hid
his body in the straw, and, mounting his horse, fled to the woods.
5. After wandering several days, uncertain of his fate, he came to
a guide-post. By means of the marks on this, he found his way.
Thus he returned, through Russia, Poland, Germany, and France,
to his native country; not, however, till he had turned aside through
Spain, to visit the kingdom of Morocco, and spent a short time there.
6. He reached England just as companies were forming for settling
the new continent of America. As he had lost none of his courage or
bravery, he was admirably adapted to the hazardous undertaking.
He was immediately attached to the expedition under Captain Newport, and made, as we have seen, one of the members of the Virginia
council.
7. Small bodies of men, when exposed to great danger, are, for the
most part, united among themselves. But it was not so, as we have
seen, with the Jamestown colony. There was no bond of union,
even in the hour of danger. To restore harmnony, then, was the first
object at which Smith aimed.
8. Peace and order, by his efforts, being at length restored, he
found leisure to do something towards defending the colony from foes
without. The Indians threatened them. By his ingenuity, he succeeded in quieting them for the present, as well as in removing the
fears which had agitated the colony.
CHAPTER XIII.
Smith taken prisoner.
1. As soon as the colony became secure and was well supplied
with provisions, Smith undertook a short voyage of discovery. An
opinion prevailed among the first voyagers to America, into which
Smith had fallen among the rest, that it was only a little way across
the country to the South Sea - the ocean path to every sort of wealth.
They supposed that by ascending almost any river which came fromin
the northwest, they could soon find a passage by water, thither.
2. The Chickahominy is a branch of the James, uniting with it a
little above Jamestown. With a handful of associates, Smith ascended it in a barge as far as it was boatable, and then, leaving the
barge with a part of the men, who were to remain aboard, ascended
in a canoe still higher up the stream.
3. He had no soonelr left the boat, than the crew went ashore at
the very spot where a brother of Powhatan, withl some Indians, lay
in ambush. They seized one of the men, and, after having compelled

28MORE NAVAL VICTORIES.
CHAPTER CLX1.
More Naval Victories.
1. THE success of the naval forces of the United States, for this
year, was, throughout, as brilliant as the conduct of the land forces
was disgracefill. Where least was expected, and where there was
least reason to expect anything, there the most heroic bravery-inot
to say the most unprecedented skill- was manifested.
2. On the 18th of October, the United States' sloop Wasp, of
eighteen guns, commanded by Captain Jones, came up with and
captured the British sloop Frolic, Captain Wynyates, of about the
same size and force, about eight hundred miles eastward of Norfolk, in Virginia. The action lasted about three quarters of an
hour.
3. Both vessels were much injured in the engagement, but the
Wasp suffered most in her rigging.  She had only five men killed
and five wounded. The fire of the Wasp evidently fell below the
rigging of the Frolic; for the latter had at least seventy or eighty
killed or wounded. Indeed, it was said that not twenty of her men
escaped wholly unhurt.
4. The Frolic had scarcely submitted to the Wasp, when a British
seventy-four gun ship hove in sight- the Poictiers- and immediately
bore down upon them. As they were in no situation either to escape
or make a defence, they were forthwith taken and carried into Bermuda.
5. One week later than this, viz., October 25, a still more remarkable victory was obtained by our little navy. The United States,
another forty-four gun ship, commanded by Commodore Decatur, who
had distinguished himself so much at Tripoli, fell in with and encountered the British frigate Macedonian, Captain Carden, rated at thirtyeight guns, but really carrying forty-nine.
6. This action took place in the Atlantic Ocean, about seven hundred miles southward of the Azores. It lasted an hour and a half,
and was very fatal to the crew of the Macedonian. Out of her complement of three hundred men, she had more than a hundred killed
and wounded, while the United States had but seven killed and five
wounded.
7. One of those killed on board the Macedonian was the carpenter.
As he was known to be in destitute circumstances, and to have left a
family of helpless children with a worthless mother, his brave companions immediately held a contribution, and raised eight hundred
dollars, to be put in safe hands, for the education of the unhappy
orphans.

that they make so wise an application of their charities as in this
case.
9. Another victory was achieved by our brave tars before the year
closed. Captain Hull had retired from the service, and had been
succeeded in the command of the Constitution by Commodore Bainbridge. On the 29th of December, while off the coast of Brazil, the
British frigate Java, of forty-nine guns, came in sight, and a battle
ensued.
10. The engagement was severe from the first. It had continued
nearly two hours, and nearly two hundred men had been killed or
wounded on board the Java, when she was compelled to strike her
colors. She was so much injured that it was concluded, a few days
afterward, to burn her. The loss of the Constitution was hardly one
sixth as great as that of the Java.
11. On board the Java, during the battle, was an American prisoner, in confinement.  Anxious to know the issue, he often asked a
Chinese, who was stationed near him, how the battle was going on.
" Oh, a glorious victory," was the reply always. Not satisfied with
this, especially as he saw so many wounded men brought below, he
asked which side was about to gain the victory.  "Why," said the
Chinese, "one or t' other."
CHAPTER CLXII.
Events of 181.2 and 1813.
1. SEVERAL interesting events of our national history took place
during the years 1812 and 1813, which deserve a place in our history.
2. One of these was the admission, some time in 1812, of Louisiana to the federal union. She was the eighteenth pillar of the great
national fabric, and a most important one, as she holds the keys of
entrance, through the mouth of a mighty river, to the richest, if not
the most extensive valley in the world.
3. The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions
was also incorporated in 1812; and five missionaries were ordained at
Salem to preach the gospel at Bombay, in Asia. They were the first
foreign missionaries ever ordained here. Yet the same board, in
1842, thirty years later, sustained no less than one hundred and thirty-four of these foreign missionaries.
4. Very early in the year 1813, the Emperor of Russia kindly
offered to try to make peace between Great Britain and the United
States; and Albert Gallatin, James A. Bayard, and John Quincy
Adams were appointed as commissioners, and sent to Russia to meet

such commissioners as the British might appoint, and, if practicable,
to make a treaty between the two countries.
5. The term for which Mr. Madison had been elected president
expired on the 4th of March, 1813, and a-strong effort was made, by
the party opposed to the war, to elect De Witt Clinton in his stead;
but they did not succeed. Mr. Madison was reelected, and George
Clinton was also reelected vice-president; he died soon after, and was
succeeded by Elbridge Gerry.
6. Cotton manufactories began to flourish this year. In the neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island, one hundred and twenty thousand spindles were in operation, consuming six million pounds of
cotton yearly. About the end of this year, twenty thousand or thirty
thousand spindles were running at Baltimore. Yet, in 1809, not a
thread of cotton was spun by machinery in this country.
7. This year, 1813, moreover, was remarkable for two more events.
the birth of the Massachusetts Society for the Suppression of Intemperance, which led the way to so much good in the United States,
and the death of him who may be justly considered as the father of
temperance societies here, Dr. Benjamin Rush.

CHAPTER CLXIII.
The Massacre at Frenchtown.
1. WE have seen that the north-western division of the United
States' army was stationed in the neighborhood of Detroit, and was
under the command of General Harrison. There, too, they wintered. General Harrison's plan was to collect a sufficient force in
that neighborhood, and, as soon as he could, retake Detroit and
the other forts and places which General Hull had so unwisely surrendered.
2. Early in January, news came fom     Frenchtown, a place
twenty-six miles from Detroit, that the British and Indians were
coming against them; praying, at the same time, for assistance.
General Winchester, with eioht hundred men, marched thither,
and succeeded in driving away the British and Indians, who had
already arrived, but was, in his turn, driven away by the British,
on the 23d inst., and himself and five hundred men taken prisoners.
3. Their surrender was followed by a scene almost too shocking to
describe. General Proctor, the British commander, had pledged his
honor that the lives and private property of the American soldiers
should be respected after the surrender. But, instead of this, the
dead were stripped and scalped -the wounded, such as were unable
to rise, butchered, and the living stripped and plundered, and many
of them tomahawked, or only reserved to be roasted at the stake.
Few of them lived to be exchanged.
4. It is maintained by some that General Proctor could not have
prevented these barbarities. It is difficult, however, to believe this.
The bare thought of such a massacre is shocking, whether it could
have been avoided or not. It exhibits, in a most striking manner, the
horrors of war, especially of Indian warfare.
5. What rendered this massacre at Frenchtown more afflictive
was the fact that most of the troops were the flower of Kentucky.
They were, many of them, young men who had a large circle of
respectable relatives. Their bodies lay in the fields till autumn,
when their friends ventured to collect their bleaching bones and bury
them.
6. The news of General Winchester's defeat reached General
Harrison while on his march to Frenchtown with reinforcements.
Finding himself too late, he stopped at the rapids of the river
Maumee and built a fort, which, in honor of the governor of Ohio, he
called Fort Meigs. This he made, for the present, the head quarters
of his army.

CHAPTER CLXIV.
Capture of York, and Death of General Pike.
1. LITTLE, if anything, was done, durinig the year 1812, to in
crease the naval force of the United States, either on the ocean or
the lakes. Commodore Chauncey had indeed been sent to Lalcke
Ontario, about the 1st of September, to fit up the Oneida, a vessel
of sixteen guns, and to arm half a dozen schooners, and thus form
a little squadron. There had also been some skirmishing upon the
lake.
2. The next spring, General Dearborn laid a plan to attack York,
in Upper Canada, the great depository of the British military stores.
His troops, amounting to seventeen hundred men, embarked, about
the middle of April, on board Commodore Chauncey's vessels, and,
on the 25th, they set sail for York.
3. The army was directed by General Pike, a young man of
great promise, who had requested the command as a favor. They
landed at York on the 27th. As they were moving towards the gar
rison, a magazine exploded, which the British had prepared for the
purpose, and which killed General Pike and about a hundred of his
men.
4. General Pike did not die, however, though his head was literally crushed by the heavy stone which fell on it, till he had seen the

town and all the barracks, and fortifications, and stores, and seven
hundred and fifty of the enemy, in the possession of his victorious
troops. The loss, in killed and wounded, was great on both sides,
but greatest on the side of the Americans.
5. Zebulon M. Pike, who lost his life in this engagement, was a
native of New Jersey, and was not only well instructed, but made
healthy and robust by active exercise. As his father had been an
officer in the revolutionary army, the son was trained to military life,
and was early made a lieutenant on the western frontiers.
6. - About the time when Lewis and Clarke were sent on an exploring tour up the Missouri, Lieutenant Pike, with twenty men,
and provisions for four months, was sent up the Mississippi. The
company set out August 5, 1805. Instead of four monthF however,
hey were absent almost nine months, exposed to nearly ev,ry danger
and hardship.
7. Sometimes they were wholly without food for several days
together. At other times, they slept, without any covering, upon
the bare ground, or upon the snow; for they were out all winter, and
the winter was unusually severe. Sometimes they were obliged to
leave their boat and build canoes; and sometimes they carried their
canoes, from place to place, on their backs.
8. Though sent to acquire information, they had no surveyor or
clerk with them but Pike. He was, as he justly says of himself, at
once the commanding officer, clerk, astronomer, surveyor, spy, guide,
and hunter of the party. He kept his journal and drew all his
sketches by the fire at night in the openl air.
9. In two months after his return, he was sent out by General
Wilkinson to obtain geographical and other information on the borders
of New Mexico. Again he was out all winter, unprotected. All the
horses belonging to the party(died, and all the men, but Pike himself,
were more or less frozen.
10. But these were not all the trials to which he was exposed.
Unexpectedly, they found themselves upon the banks of the Rio del
Norte river, within the Spanish territory. Here they were seized by
a band of Spanish cavalry, and, what was worst of all, Pike's instruments and papers, except his private journal, were taken from him.
The party were, however, at length, all liberated, and, in July, 1807,
reached Natchitoches.
11. Such was the education, properly so called, of this most interesting young man, who, at the age of thirty-three, became a brigadier
general in the American army, and, at thirty-four, begged the favor
of leading the American troops in an attack on Little York, to die,
like Wolfe before Quebec, in the moment of victory.

York, was assailed by General Bond and Colonel Miller, on the 27th
of May, and, after a sharp and bloody conflict, was taken, and with

attacked by the British, about this time, but the effort was unsuccessful.
CHAPTER CLXV.
Siege of Fort Mfeigs, and General Harrison.
HIlarrison.
1. ON the first day of May, 1713, General Proctor, with one
thousand British regulars and militia, and more than a thousand'Indians, laid siege to Fort Meigs, the head quarters of the army
under General Harrison, and continued the siege, with great vigor,
for nine days.
2. During the third day of the siege, General Proctor sent an
officer to demand the surrender of the fort. The forces in it were
probably about two thousand. General Harrison's reply was not
quite as laconic as the very ancient one, "Come and take it," but
nearly so. "Not, sir," says he to General Proctor, "while I have
the honor to command."
3. A reinforcement was received, on the fifth day of the siege,
from Kentucky. It was a body of troops under the command of
General Clay. Aided by these, an attack was made on the British,
in which both parties suffered so much that they did not choose to
renew the hostilities for several days. On the ninth day, the British
gave up the siege.

4. Fort Meigs was besieged again, on the 22d of May, by General
Proctor, but not for a long period. The attention of the troops was
soon turned to Fort Stephenson. This was assailed by the united
forces of the British and Indians in that quarter, but was promptly
and successfully defended by Major Croghan, a young and accomplished oficer. General Proctor, at his retreat from Fort Stephenson, returned to Malden.
CHAPTER CLXVI.
The War onz the Ocean.
1. ON the ocean, in the year 1813, the United States were less fortunate, especially during the first six months of the year, than they
had been in 1812. The Chesapeake frigate, and the Argus sloop of
war, fell into the hands of the enemy, and a portion of the navy was
blockaded at New London.
2. The loss of the Chesapeake, of thirty-eight guns, commanded
by Captain Lawrence, was an event which excited intense interest
throughout the country. He had put to sea expecting that he should
be obliged to contend with the Shannon; which fact added greatly to
the mortification of defeat.
3. He left the port of Boston, in pursuit of the Shannon, about
noon on the 1st of June. The contest began about half-past five,
in the afternoon, and lasted about fifteen minutes. The battle was
attack on the British! 4. Who defended Fort Stephenson? What of General Proctor

uncommonly bloody.    Both ships, it is said, were like charnel
houses.
4. Captain Lawrence was first wounded in the leg, and afterward
shot through the body. Yet even then he was unwilling to yield the
palm to the British, but, as he was being carried below, said, sternrly,
" Don't give up the ship."  Yet it was unavoidable. The British
had already boarded the Chesapeake, and the resistance made to them
was momentary.
5. In this terrible conflict, the Americans had sixty-two killed and
eighty-four wounded, and the British twenty-eight killed and fiftyeight wounded. When the battle was over, both vessels sailed for
Halifax, where Captain Lawrence, after suffering the most intense
anguish for five or six days, expired.
6. Captain Lawrence was thirty-two years of age, and much
beloved. As a proof of the attachment of his younger officers to him,
the following anecdote is related. The midshipmen of one of our
squadrons gave a dinner to Commodore Rodgers one day, at which it
was proposed not to ask any lieutenant.  "What, not Mr. Lawrence?" said one. It was decided immediately to have Lawrence
present; but no other lieutenant was there.
7. The unexpected issue of this battle may have been owing,
in part, to the neglect of those whose duty it was to pay the
men their prize money. The Chesapeake had been cruising and had
taken prizes, and the men had not been paid their share; and,
though some sort of an apology had been made, many were not satisfied.
8. Among the disaffected ones was the boatswain's mate. When
the British boarded the Chesapeake, this man quitted his post and ran
below, leaving the gratings open, so that the men readily followed his
examnple. When the officers attempted to rally their men to repel the
enemy, they could not find them. The boatswain's mate was heard
to say, as he retreated," So much for not having paid men their prize
money. "
9. A battle was fought, on the 22d of June of this year, at Craney
Island, in the Chesapeake Bay, between a large British fleet, which
was cruising there, under Sir Sidney Beckwith and Admiral Warren,
and some officers and sailors of the navy and a body of Virginia
militia. The British were defeated, with the loss of more than twelve
hundred men.
10. In less than two months after the capture of the Chesapeake,
the American navy experienced another reverse of fortune in the loss
the Argus, of eighteen guns.  She was captured by the Pelican, of
twenty guns, after a hard-fought battle, in which her first officer and
five men fell and sixteen were wounded.
11. The Argus had been out to France, to carry Mr. Crawford,
our minister, and was on her return. She had taken quite a number

tff prizes on the very coast of Great Britain, and so much annoyed
thie enemy that several vessels had been sent out in search of her.
Among these was the successful Pelican.
12. But the tide of victory at length began to turn. On the 5th
of September, the Enterprise took the British brig Boxer, after a
hard-fought battle of half an hour, in which she lost but one man,
her commander, Lieutenant Burrows; while the loss of the British
was considerable, including, also, her commander, Captain Blythe.
Both these officers were young, active and promising.
CHAPTER CLXVII.
Battle on Lake Erie.
1. A SMALL fleet had, during the year 1813, been collected on
l,ake Erie, consisting of nine vessels, carrying, in the whole, fiftyfive guns, and placed in the care of Commodore Oliver H. Perry.
Following our example, as they had also done on Lake Ontario, the
British had their little fleet to oppose it, consisting of six vessels and
sixty-three guns.
2. These small fleets, after some skirmishing, came at length to
close action.  It was the tenth of September.        The battle was

4. Having proceeded about twenty miles, they overtook and killed
the companions of Smith, and wounded him. They then surrounded
and attempted to take him; but, though wounded, he defended himself until he had killed three of his assailants, when he sunk deep in a
marsh and was captured.
5. Smith knew the character of the Indians, and set about devising
expedients to prolong his life. He took from his pocket a compass,
and amused his guards by showing them the vibrations of the needle.
He also endeavored to give them some feeble notions of the earth and
of the visible heavenly bodies. He also made use of other little
devices to gain time.
6. But what most excited the wonder of the savages was the fact
that he could make a few marks on paper, from which the colonists
of Jamestown could understand him and comply with his requestfor, as he was some time among the Indians, they permitted him to
make the experiment. For a while, they regarded him as a sort of
magician, whom it might not be safe to destroy.
7. They concluded, at length, however, to conduct him to Powhatan. He was therefore bound for this purpose and brought before
the king, whom he found seated on a wooden throne, with two girls,
his daughters, at his side. After a consultation with his principal
men, it was determined to put him to death, and they proceeded to
make the preparation.

length the British seemed to have the advantage. The Lawrence,
the American commodore's own vessel, became so crippled as to be
almost unmanageable.
3. At this critical moment, Commodore Perry abandoned his own
vessel, and went, in a boat, on board the Niagara, his second ship,
commanded by Captain Elliot. Before this, the firing had almost
ceased, and the British commander, Captain Barclay, counting on
certain victory, though himself wounded, would not have given; as
he said afterward, a sixpence for the whole American fleet.
4. But the scene now changed. The battle waxed hot again, and,
in about four hours after its first commencement, the British fleet
surrendered to the American. The loss of the Americans was
twenty-seven killed and ninety-six wounded; that of the British was
somewhat greater, besides prisoners.
5. Commodore Perry wrote to General Harrison immediately
after the battle, and also to the war department. In both instances
he was as modest as he was laconic. To (General Harrison he oiily
said, "We have met the enemy, and they are ours. Two ships,
two brigs, one schooner, and one sloop."  To the secretary of war
he said little more, except to refer to the good providence of
God.
6. The commodore has been much censured for hazarding his
life, in going from the Lawrence to the Niagara, in a small boat, in
the midst of shot thick as hail. But we must remember that the
Lawrence was useless; that there was danger everywhere; and
that it was thought better to act, than to stand still and be shot down
without an effort.
7. Had he been killed in the attempt, and had the battle been lost,
he would, no doubt, have been as much blamed by the world as he
now has been commended. Honors are not always apportioned to
true desert. The fortunate are very apt to be regarded as the truly
brave, and the unfortunate, whatever may be their real merit, are
often overlooked or forgotten.
CHAPTER CLXVIII
Battle at the Moravian Towns.
1. THOuGH the Americans had now the command of Lake Erie,
and the whole British coast below, as far down as Fort George, yet
General Proctor was in possession of most of the forts and places
above, which had been relinquished by Hull.  But he was at length
growing fearful of his opponents, and, as the result seems to have
shown, not without good reason.

2. Governor Shelby, of Kentucky, with four thousand militia,
having joined the army under General Harrison, it was thought
best to maklie an attack on Detroit and the other posts in that neighborhood. With this view, the troops, on the 27th of September,
went on board the American fleet, and the same day were landed at
Malden.
3. This place was on the British side, opposite Detroit, but rather
below. Here they expected to find troops and store-houses. To
their surprise, however, the British had burnt the fort and all their
stores, and made good their retreat into the interior, before their
arrival.
4. The next day, the army crossed the river, and, on the 29th,
took possession of Detroit without opposition. On the 2d of October, Harrison and Shelby, with three thousand five hundred picked
men, recrossed the river and pursued General Proctor. They found
him encamped at the Moravian Towns, as they were called, on the
river T'hames, eighty-six miles north-eastward of Detroit.
5. Here, on the 5th of October, was fought a most severe battle.
But the British force, though large, was not equal to ours, and the
Indians did not persevere. Their chief, Tecumseh, having fallen,
they fled. They were soon followed by General Proctor and about
two hundred men; and the rest of the army, with all their cannon
fell into the hands of the Americans.
6. The British army lost, in killed, wounded and prisoners, about
seven hundred men. About one hundred and twenty Indians were
slain. The American loss, in killed and wounded, was fifty. Our

army took six brass cannon which Hull had surrendered, on two
of which were inscribed the following words: "Surrendered by Burgoyne, at Saratoga."
7. Tecumseh, the chief who fell, was of the Shawanese tribe, andi
was a remarkable man. In early life, it is said, he was not distinguished as a warrior, but was rather cowardly. At the age of
twenty-five he had not only retrieved his character, but had become
the boldest of his tribe.
8. He was brother to the Shawanese chief, called the Prophet,
whose men General Harrison defeated in the battle of Tippecanoe;
but, at the time of that conflict, he was absent. When the war of
1812 commenced, he was made a brigadier general in the British
army, and he continued to fight for his royal masters till his death.
9. Tecumseh was distinguished; through life, for truth, temperance and chastity; as well as for his disregard of all external marks
of office or rank. When he was made a general, a sash was given
him, but he returned it with every manifestation of contempt. He
was truly a savage; he neither gave nor accepted any quarter in
wa;r; though elsewhere he was generous, disinterested, hospitable
and humane.
10. He was greatly distinguished for his eloquence. His speeches,
it is said, might bear a comparison with those of the most celebrated
orators of Greece and Rome. He was about five feet and ten inches
in height, and beautifully formed. Tecumseh was, in truth, a man
of remarkable endowments, and, with the advantages of civilization,
might have attained an enviable fame.
CHAPTER CLXIX.
Progress of the War in Canada.
1. THE war being ended in the north-west, General Harrison left
General Cass at Detroit, with one thousand men, and repaired to
Buffalo, to join General Wilkinson, who had, just before this time,
succeeded in the chief command to General Dearborn. The great
object of the army now was to take Kingston and Montreal.
2. The army consisted of five thousand troops at Fort George,
two thousand at Sacket's Harbor, and four thousand at Lake Champlain; making, in all, eleven thousand men: in addition to which, a
considerable body was every day expected to arrive under General
Harrison. In addition to all this, the fleet, under Commodore Chauncey, held itself in readiness to co6perate with the army.

given up, and the army was ordered to proceed at once to Montreal,
chiefly by marching a distance of one hundred and eighty miles.
They left Sacket's Harbor September 30.
4. They were delayed as they passed along, in various ways,
especially by the attacks of small parties of the British on the Canada
shore; and, at Williamsburg, a severe contest ensued. General
Boyd commanded in this battle, General Wilkinson being indisposed.
Both parties may be said to have been beaten, for both retreated with
great loss.
5. Difficulties arose, about this time, among the American officers,
especially between General Wilkinson and General Hampton. The
troops of General Harrison, moreover, from some cause or other, did
not arrive. A council of war was held, at the request of General
Wilkinson, at which it was decided to give up the expedition for
that season, and go to winter quarters.
6. The place selected for this purpose was called French Mills,
a hundred miles or more fromn Sacket's Harbor, and fifty or sixty
from Plattsburg. Here they remained till February, when, two
thousand of them having been detached and sent to the Niagara
frontier, the remainder, after having destroyed their barracks, proceeded to Plattsburg.
CHAPTER CLXX.
War with the Creek Indians.
1. SCARCELY had the northern army gone to winter quarters at
French Mills, when the public mind became directed to a war which
had broken out with the Creek Indians. The Creeks appear to have
led the way in this strife, by their seizure of Fort Mimms, and the
massacre of three hundred men and women, who had fled to it for
safety. This sad event occurred August 30.
2. News of this murder having been received, two thousand men
from Tennessee, under the command of Major General Jackson, and
five hundred under General Coffee, were ordered out against them.
The Creeks were defeated at Tallushatches, Talladega, Autosse,
Emucfau, and several other places, though not without severe loss on
the part of the Americans.
3. Still they were by no means subdued. They erected a breast
work at a place called the Horse-Shoe Bend, on the Tallapoose
river, and posted a hundred men there. Here they held out for
some time. At last it was determined to dislodge them. The

scattered forces of the country, with General Jackson at their head,
were at length before their fort.'4. The attack was made on the 27th of March, 1814. General
Jackson assailed the fort, while General Coffee attacked a village
near by, to drive the inhabitants to the fortifications. As soon as
they were all fairly within them, General Jackson led his forces on,
with fixed bayonets, to the breast-work, where they fought the
Indians, for some time, through the port-holes.
5. At length, however, the soldiers scaled the breast-work, and
pursued the work of death within the fort. The contest here became
terrible. The Indians who survived escaped, but not till the ground
was covered with dead bodies. Three hundred women and children
were taken prisoners. The number who perished did not fall much
short of six hundred.
6. Thus terminated the struggle. A treaty was made with the
Creeks by General Jackson, on the 9th of August, by which they
agreed to give up a portion of their territory to the whites, to pay the
expenses of the war, to allow roads to be cut through their lands, to
permit the free navigation of their rivers, and to take no more bribes
of the British.
7. The following is the speech of Weatherford, their leader, at
the treaty. "I am in your power. Do with me what you please.
I have done the white people all the harm I could. I have fought
them, and fought them bravely. There was a time when I had a
choice; I have none now; even hope is ended. Once I could animate my warriors; but I cannot animate the dead. They can no
longer hear my voice; their bones are at Tallushatches, Talladega,
Einucfau and Tohopeka."
CHAPTER CLXXI.
Progress of the War.
1. THE proposal of the Emperor of Russia, to mediate between
the United States and Great Britain, had not been accepted by the
latter, but it was proposed to negotiate without any foreign interference. This proposal was at once approved by the government of
the United States, and commissioners were appointed, on both sides,
to meet at Gottenburg. The place of meeting, however, was afterwards changed to Ghent, in Flanders.
2. They did not assemble till August, and, in the mean time, the
war, which has been mentioned, with the Creeks, had been prosecuted, and many more battles fought by land and by sea. Congress
had also held two sessions-the regular session of the winter and

an extra session, which commenced in May, 1814, and continued to
A ug ust.
3. At these meetings of congress, provision had been made for
raising, men and money, and especially for strengthening the navy,
securing our commerce, and regulating the revenue. The treasury
was rather empty, and an expensive war could not be conducted, on
a frontier thousands of miles in extent, and on the ocean too, without
much monley.
4. Among the measures which had been adopted, in the winter of
1813-14, was the laying of an embargo. This, however, was repealed
the next April. The extra session of 1814 was chiefly spent in devising means for replenishing the treasury; for, though the offer of a
bounty of one hundred and twenty-fou'r dollars to every soldier who
would enlist for five years, or during the war, had procured men, yet
these men must be paid.
5. A system of internal or domestic taxation was at length resolved
on, and laws were passed laying taxes on lands, houses, carriages,'distilled liquors, refined sugars, retailers' licenses, &amp;c. In addition
to the five millions and a half of dollars which it was expected would
be raised in this way, it was decided to borrow seven millions and a
half more.
6..One additional measure was adopted, which met with some
opposition on account of the expense. This was the construction of
one or more steam batteries, to be employed in the defence of our
ports, rather than in carrying on the war at sea. For this object,
half a million of dollars was appropriated.
7. It should not be forgotten that the party, in the United States,
who had always been opposed to the war, continued their opposition.
They even charged the government party with being influenced by an
undue attachment to the French; in proof of which they cited the
fact that war was declared just at the time when the forces of Britain
were most needed in Europe to repel the ambitious projects of
Napoleon.
CHAPTER CLXXII.
The War on the Ocean.
1. THE spring of 1814 opened with the loss of the United States'
frigate Essex, of thirty-two guns, Commodore Porter, in the bay of
Valparaiso, in Chili. The Essex had been cruising in the Pacific
Ocean a long time, and had taken many prizes, and, though she had
run into a neutral port, the British were determined not to spare her.

2. She was attacked, on the 28th of March, by a force greatly
superior to her own, consisting of the British frigate Phebe, of thirtysix guns, and a sloop of war, by the name of Cherub, of eighteen
guns. The contest was long and severe, and the loss of the Essex
was very great, amounting to above one hundred and fifty in killed
and wounded. Both vessels were much injured; the Pheebe could
hardly be kept from sinking immediately.
3. On the 29th of April, the United States' sloop of war Peacock,
commanded by Captain, now Commodore Warrington, while off the
coast of Florida, fell in with and captured the British brig Epervier,
of eighteen guns. The battle lasted forty-five minutes. The British
had eighteen killed and thirteen wounded; the Americans had only
two wounded.
4. The United States' sloop Wasp, also of eighteen guns, took the
British sloop of war Reindeer, of eighteen. The loss was considerable on both sides. The action lasted twenty-eight minutes. It was
fought near the coast of Great Britain, and the Reindeer was destroyed
to prevent a recapture.
5. But the Wasp had not yet completed her work. Besides making a number of prizes on the coast of Great Britain and France, she
fell in with the British sloop Avon, on the 1st of September, and,
after a running fight of several hours. captured her. She was sent
to America, but was lost on her passage.
6. Important additions having been made, early-this year, to the
fleet on Lake Ontario, Commodore Chauncey was able to render very
efficient aid to the army on the frontier, in its operations, and to watch
the movements of the British forces, both on the land and on the
lake. There was, however, no considerable action between the two
fleets.
7. The British had, for some time past, held the port of New
London, in Connecticut, in a state of blockade, having chased two of
our ships of war, the United States and the Macedonian, up the river.
On the 11th of August, the British, under Commodore Hardy, proceeded to bombard Stonington, but were gallantly repulsed with considerable loss.
CHAPTER CLXXIII.
Defeat of General Wilkinson.
1. EARLY in the spring of 1814, a detachment of two thousand
British soldiers had been ordered to post theniselves near the river
Sorel, to prevent General Wilkinson, who was still at Plattsburg,

from advancing on Canada. The spot which they fortified was within
the British lines.
2. When General Wilkinson heard of this movement, he marched,
at the head of four thousand men, and, on the 31st of March, attacked
their works. Finding their fortifications much stronger than he
expected, he at length retreated; but not till he had lost, in killed
and wounded, about one hundred and forty men.
3. General Wilkinson was tried, some time afterward, for his conduct on this and other occasions, by a court-martial, which convened
at Troy, in the state of New York. He was at length acquitted,
though not till facts had been developed, in regard to his character,
which are not easily or readily forgotten.
4. One conspicuous fault in his character appears to have existed;
a fault of which many a brave man has been found guilty. In one
action at the north, when he was unable to command, and pleaded
illness as an excuse, it turned out he was at a house in the neighborhood, in a state of intoxication.
5. Many a battle has been lost, not only in the wars of the United
States, but elsewhere, because the chiefofficer in command was
unnerved by liquor. But the worst of this evil of intemperate officers
and soldiers is that they remain so when the war is over, and not only
carry with them to the grave their bad habits, but spread them by
their example.
6. During the months of April, May and June, there was little
fighting either on the sea-coast or the Canadian frontier. One reason
for this, doubtless, was that Great Britain had about as much as she
could do at home, or near home, in combatting Napoleon.'
7. But no sooner had Napoleon fallen, than the British were at
liberty to pour their thousands in upon America. No less than fourteen thousand of the troops which had fought under Wellington were
let loose upon our frontier through Canada.
CHAPTER CLXXIV.
The War at the NVorth-west.
1. ABOUT the 1st of July, General Brown crossed the Niagara
river, near Buffalo, and took possession of Fort Erie without opposition. Meanwhile, a large number of the British forces had advanced
as far up the river as Chippewa, a few miles lower down than Fort
Erie, where they were strongly entrenched, under General Riall.

Amierican army, and amounted to about three thousand five hundred.
The British army was nearly equal in point of numbers, and was
equally well selected. On the 4th of July, General Brown advanced
to Chippewa, and made an attack on the enemy.
3. This battle at Chippewa was exceedingly obstinate and bloody.
The Americans were, it is true, the victors, but they paid dearly for
the victory. They lost more than three hundred men. The loss of
the British exceeded five hundred. They were, moreover, obliged to
quit the field, and retreat down the river to Burlington Heights.
4. Here they were reinforced by General Drummond, who took,he command, and led the army back towards the American camp.
On the 25th of July, they met at Bridgewater, nearly opposite the
falls of the Niagara, and one of the most obstinate battles took place
which was ever fought in America.
5. The contest lasted from four o'clock in the afternoon, until midnight, when the British retreated. As soon as they had departed,
the Americans retired to their encampment, but not being able to.
remove the artillery they had taken from the enemy, the latter
returned and seized it, and claimed the victory.
6. Neither side, however, had much reason to be proud of the
results of the day. The Americans, with only three thousand to four
thousand men, had lost, in killed and wounded, eight hundred and
sixty, and the British, with about five thousand men, eight hundred
and seventy-eight.  Besides, the principal generals on each side were
among the wounded, and General Riall was taken prisoner.

7. The American forces were now greatly reduced, and, as there
was no prospect of an immediate reinforcement, they retreated up the
river to Fort Erie, where they made a stand. General Drummond
followed them, and, on the 4th of August, commenced a siege. The
fort was, at first, commanded by General Ripley, but subsequently by
General Gaines.
8. The siege continued to be prosecuted with great vigor. On the
15th of August, a large British force advanced against the fort in
three columns. They were, however, repulsed, with the loss of fiftyseven killed, three hundred and nineteen wounded, and five hundred
and thirty-nine missing. All this while, the American forces did not
exceed fifteen hundred efficient men.
9. At length, General Izard arrived from Plattsburg with a reinforcement of five thousand men. Just before his arrival, General
Brown, who had recovered of his wounds and taken the command of
the troops, ordered a body of his men to sally forth and attack the
invaders. In this sortie, the British lost a thousand men; the Americans comparatively few.
10. The siege of the fort lasted forty-nine days, when the British
retreated, and the Americans pursued them. A second battle was
fought near Chippewa, on the 20th of October, in which the Americans were victorious, though the triumph was dearly bought.
CHAPTER CLXXV.
City of Washington burnt.
1. WE have already seen that the downfall of Napoleon had been
the means of bringing over to America a large force, to act both by
sea and land, on the coast and the frontiers. It is thought that the
whole number which came over, this season. could not have been less
than thirty thousand.
2. One portion of these troops was destined to the Chesapeake
Bay. They arrived in a squadron of fifty or sixty sail, and, having
entered the bay, proceeded slowly up the Potomac river. At a con
siderable distance below Washington, five thousand men, under
General Ross, were put on shore, who marched, as rapidly as circumstances permitted, towards the capital; a part of the fleet following
thenm.
3. They met with little resistance till they came to B3ladensburg,
six miles from Washington. Here General Winder had collected
together a body of militia, and Commodore Barney of the navy had
the command of a few cannon and about four hundred men. The

CHAPTER XIV.
Story of Pocahontas.
1. Two large stones were brought in, and laid at the feet of the
savage king, and Smith's head was placed on one of them, while the
~avages gathered around to witness the execution. Powhatan's club
was raised, and every one was waiting in silent suspense to see it fall
on the victim.
2. At this critical instant, Pocahontas, the eldest of the girls, and
the most beloved by the king, now scarcely twelve years of age,
rushed forward and threw herself with a shriek on Smith. Her hair
was loose, and her eyes wild and streaming with tears. She raised
her hands to her father, and besought him, with all the power of In
dian eloquence, to spare his captive.
3. Powhatan, thoug-h little used to pity, could not resist her entreaties and tears.'He dropped his uplifted club, and looked round
upon his warriors, as if to gather new courage. They too were
touched with pity, though they were savages. At last he raised his
daughter, and promised her to spare the prisoner's life.
4. He was accordingly spared, and the very next day conducted by
a guard of twelve men to Jamestown. He had been a prisoner about
seven weeks. He was to send back by the guard two cannon and a
grindstone, for which Powhatan was to let him have a large tract of
country; and forever regard him as his son.
5. He reached Jamestown in safety, but not wishing to send guns

latter behaved with great courage, but, being deserted by the militia,
who fled at the first approach of the foe, they were soon obliged to
surrender.
4. The British proceeded to the capital. They reached it on the
23d of August, in the evening. The main body of the army, meeting with little resistance, halted a mile and a half out of the city.
General Ross, with only seven hundred men, entered the place and
burnt the capitol, the president's house, the public offices, the arsenal,
and the navy-yard.
5. In burning the capitol, they destroyed its valuable library and
furniture. Private property was respected but little more than public.
One hotel, with several private buildings, was destroyed. The bridge,
west of the city, across the Potomac, was also burnt.
6. The British boasted much of their success in taking the seat of
governminent of the United States, and some of them seemed to think
the whole country would be soon ready to submit to the British yoke.
However, it was discovered that to conquer a single city is not to
enslave a whole country.
7. After the capture and destruction of Washington, the British
reembarked on board their fleet'and returned down the river. On
their way, however, they halted at Alexandria long enough to demand
and receive the surrender of the city. This took place August 29
CHAPTER CLXXVI.
Battle near Baltimore.
1. THE British went as rapidly as possible from Washington to
Baltimore. They reached the mouth of the Patapsco, fourteen miles
below the city, on the 11th of September. The next day, six thousand men were landed from the fleet. at North Point. and, under the
command of General Ross, they proceeded toward the city.
2. But they found more opposition here than in the neighborhood
of Washington. An army of three thousand two hundred men had
been collected and placed under the command of General Stricker. to
annoy the British and keep them in check as much as possible, in
order, at least, to give more time for putting the forts and batteries,
about the city, in a proper condition for defence. A severe battle was
fought, and the Americans were obliged to retire with considerable
loss. The killed and wounded amounted to one hundred and three,
among whom were many of the first inhabitants of Baltimore.

3. Next morning, the British advanced to the entrenchments,
about two miles from the city. At the same time, a vigorous attack
had been made on Fort McIIenry from the fleet. Great numbers of
bombs were thrown towards the fort for a whole day and night, but
they produced very little effect. All this while, preparation was
making in the city to give the enemy a warm reception if they should
determine on an attack.
4. After remaining before the city, at a somewhat respectful distance, till the evening of the 13th, they retired to their shipping, and
abandoned the enterprise. They had lost, in the battle of the 12th,
their commander, General Ross, which doubtless had its effect in discouraging them from carrying out their plan.
5. During these events, the enemy ravaged the coasts of the
Chesapeake, which reflected little credit on the British character, and
only served to exasperate the Americans, and to unite them in the
attempt to repel a foe that paid so little regard either to the law of
nations or to that of honor.

been ordered to'other stations. On the 1st of September, the whole
effective force at Plattsburg, the head-quarters of the army, did not
exceed fifteen hundred men.
2. About this time, intelligence was received that the British,
under General Provost, the governor-general of Canada, with a force
of fourteen thousand men, were on their way to Plattsburg. These
forces, for the most part, were of a character calculated to intimidate
-they were the conquerors of the conquerors of Europe.
3. But, though the land forces of this division of our army were
inconsiderable, the naval force had been raised during the war so as
to be at this time quite respectable. It consisted of a brig, a ship,
a schooner, and a sloop, and ten gun-boats, mounting, in all, about
ninety guns, and manned by eight hundred and fifty men; the whole
under the direction of Commodore Thomas McDonough.
4. The British, too, had a navy on the lake, equal, if not somewhat superior to that of the United States. Of men, it contained
at least two hundred more.   One of the vessels was, moreover,
equal, in force, to an ordinary frigate of thirty-two or thirty-six
guns.
5. General Prevost and his army arrived in the neighborhood of
Plattsburg about the time expected, and General Macomb, the commander at that place, had ordered out a body of militia, and made
every preparation which the nature of the case and the time admitted.
The fleet was lying near, ready to aid him if necessary.
6. While the two armies were thus before each other, the British
fleet appeared in sight and gave battle to the American. The contest
was a fearful one, and lasted two hours and twenty minutes; terminating in the surrender of the fleet to Commodore McDonough. A
few of the smaller vessels only escaped.
7. While the battle was going on by water, the British general
began his attack on Plattsburg- pouring upon it a shower of bombshells, balls and rockets. The Americans answered them by a
destructive fire from the fort. Before sunset, however, the attack
ceased, and the British retreated, with the loss, in killed, wounded
and missing, of about twenty-five hundred men.
8. This was a most signally fortunate day to the Americans.
The British were so completely defeated that they did not attempt to
renew the war in that quarter. They hastened down the shore of the
lake as fast as they could, niot even taking with them their wounded
or their military stores.
9. The loss, in the engagement on the lake, was great on both
sides, but greatest, by far, on the side o the British. They had
eighty-four killed and one hundred and ten wounded; the Americans
had only fifty-two killed and fifty-four wounded. So, at least, it was
reported. And yet it is stated by Cooper, in his Naval History, that
nearly every soldier on board of the Saratoga, Commodore McDonough's vessel, was more or less injured.

502CONVENTION AT HARTFORD.
10. Commodore McDonough was twice supposed to- be killed
during the action. In the first instance, a broken boom was thrown
against him with such violence as to leave him, for a few moments,
senseless. A little while afterward, he was knocked down, and
besmeared with blood, by the head of one of the seamen, which had
been shot off and thrown against him.
11. However, he survived, and was not even reckoned among the
wounded. It seems to have been agreed, beforehand, to call no person wounded as long as he could keep out of the sick room. One
man, like the commodore, was knocked down by the head of a seaman, and yet returned to his post and said nothing, though he did not
immediately recover from the shock.
12. One venerable old sailor had his clothes actually stripped off,
by a splinter, without breaking, or, so far as could be perceived, so
much as injuring the skin. He tied his pocket handkerchief around
him and went to work again, and continued at his post till the contest
was over; though he died, a few months afterward, as it was thought
of some internal injury.
13. Another anecdote of the battle of Lake Champlain is commonly reported, and is doubtless true. Some hens, confined on board
Commodore McDonough's vessel at the commencement of the battle,
got loose during the tumult, upon which a cock, who was amnong
them, flew to an elevated part of the vessel, and crowed vigorously.
Not a few of the seamen regarded this as foretelling victory, and were
encouraged by it to fight on, despite of the danger.
CHAPTER CLXXVIII.
Convention at Hartford.
1. THE refusal of three of the New England states to order out
their militia, to be subject to other officers, at the opening of the war,
has been mentioned. Demands were subsequently made, by the governors of the several states respectively, on the militia, to repel the
attacks of the enemy, especially at Saybrook, New London, Stonington, Castine, &amp;c.
2. But the opposition to the war had been increasing, rather than
diminishing. In October, 1814, it was proposed by the Massachusetts
legislature to call a convention of delegates, from the several states of
New England, to meet at some convenient place, and inquire what
ought to be done.

and a partial delegation from Vermont and New Hampshire. As a
state, Vermont had refused to have any concern in the measure.
4. These delegates, thus assembled in convention, proceeded to
canvass, with much freedom, the motives and measures which had
led to the war, and to set forth the evils which the country was suffering, in consequence of its continuance. They remainied in session
about three weeks.
5. This convention was denounced by the friends of the administration in the severest terms. It was said to be not only impolitic, as
giving encouragement to the enemy, but absolutely traitorous to the
general government. It was branded, in every possible way, with
odium; and the Hartford Convention, to this day, is, with many, but
a title of contempt. There are others, however, who maintain that it
was a patriotic and useful measure.
6. But, whatever may have been its general tendency, the convention broke up without adopting any treasonable resolutions, or attempting any dangerous movements. A few amendments of the constitution of the United States were proposed; such as, it was thought,
would hereafter prevent a recurrence of the evils under which the
country then groaned.
7. These amendments of the constitution were proposed, in the
usual form and manner, to the states, but were rejected. Meanwhile,
as we shall see presently, the war was brought to an end. Indeed, a
treaty was actually signed before the convention at Hartford broke
up, but the news had not reached this country.
CHAPTER CLXXIX.
Battle of New Orleans.
1. SEVERAL battles were fought by the two contending nations of
Great Britain and America after a treaty of peace was signed, but
before the news had reached this country. The most important of
these, however, was at New Orleans on the 8th of January, 1815.
2. A large British fleet had arrived on the coast, east of the Mississippi river, as early as December. This fleet had on board fifteen
thousand troops, under the command of Sir Edward Packenham.
General Jackson, who had so distinguished himself in the war with
the Creek Indians, now had the command of the troops of the United
States, in this quarter.
3. As there was good reason to believe that the enemy were
meditating a blow at New Orleans, General Jackson proceeded to
fortify the place as fast and as strongly as the time and the circum2. What was proposed in 1814? 3. Of what did the convention consist? 4. What was

stances would permit. Batteries were extended frem the river, eastward, in such a manner as to form a strong line of defence, fronted by
a deep ditch.
4. The enemy came to the attack in solid columns, to the number
of twelve thousand; they were well-tried and thoroughly disciplined
troops. The forces under General Jackson scarcely amounted to
half their number, and were chiefly militia. They were not, how-,
ever, all of them raw troops. A part of them had seen fighting
before.
5. No opposition was made to the British till they came fairly
within reach of the American batteries, when some twenty-five or
thirty cannon began the work of death at once. The British, however, continued to advance till they came within reach of the muskets
and rifles, when their destruction became so great that their progress
was slow.
6. From the nature of the ground, the British seemed obliged tc
advance in solid columns; but this made the destruction only so mluch
the more dreadful. The cannon of the Americans were mowing
down whole rows of them at every discharge. Unable to stand the
shock, they at last began to fly.
7. But the officers rallied them again, and led them on as far as the
very entrenchments of the Americans, where they found a ditch with
five feet of water and a steep and slippery bank beyond it. At the
moment of this desperate approach, the two principal British generals,
Packenham and Gibbs, were killed, and their third, General Kean,
was wounded.

and unable to stand the shower of liquid death which was poured upon
them, they retreated down the river. They did not embark immediately on board their shipping, but they made no more attempts against
New Orleans.
9. The results of this battle were as singular as they were dreadful. No less than seven hundred men, out of the five thousand who
were near enough to the batteries to be actually engaged, slept the
sleep of death, and fourteen hundred were wounded. Five hundred
more were prisoners. Yet all this destruction was effected with the
loss, on our part, of only seven men killed and six wounded.
CHAPTER CLXXX.
Closing Events of the War.
1. Oun little navy continued its operations, as well as the army on
shore, ignorant, of course, of what had been done at Ghent. Many
prizes were taken, and not a few severe battles fought after the commencement of the year 1815. Among the last mentioned were the
following.
2. The British ship Levant, of eighteen guns, and the frigate
Cyane, of thirty-four, were takenr by the American frigate Constitution, while on a cruise, in the Mediterranean Sea, about the 20th of
February. The battle lasted, with some intermission, three hours
and a half, but was not very severe.
3. Again, on the 23d of March, the Hornet, of the United States,
commanded by Captain Biddle, fell in with and took the British brig
Penguin, of eighteen guns. The battle lasted abc.:; twenty-two
minutes, and was warmly contested -the forces of the two vessels
being nearly equal.
4. There was an event of an adverse nature occurred about the
beginning of this year. The United States' frigate President, commanded by Commodore Decatur, in attempting to put to sea, from
New York, was pursued by the Endymion, a frigate of forty guns,
and a battle ensued, during which other vessels came to the aid of the
Endymion, and the President was captured.
5. But the war was now over. The treaty signed at Ghent had
been ratified by the United States on the 17th of February. By certain provisions of the treaty, with regard to captures which should be
made after it was ratified, the President was a lawful prize to the
British as much as if she had been taken earlier; and the Cyane and
Levant also belonged to the United States.
6. The return of peace, in the United States, was hailed with

great joy by both political parties. Much as people love war, they
become at lengthl tired of it; even when it happens, as in the present
instance, that they do not appear to have gained the ends for which
they fight. If the soldiers were not glad to exchange the sword
for the ploughshare, the nation at least were glad to have them
do it.
7. One sad story coniected with the war, which was just now
brought to a close, remains to be mentioned. It is the story of the
massacre of American prisoners, which took place at Dartmoor, in
Devonshire, England, April 6, 1815. The war was, of course, over,
and known to be over, at this time, but the prisoners had not all been
exchanged.
8. These prisoners at Dartmoor were fired upon by the guard of
the prison, at the order of the agent. Seven of them were killed and
sixty more or less wounded. TI'he British did not defend the act; it
was an act of cruelty that could not be justified. On the contrary,
much sympathy was expressed, even by the monarch on the throne,
for the widows and families of the sufferers.
9. Peace was established in the manner we have mentioned, and it
was this very year that the Massachusetts Peace Society was formed.
This institution, by itself, its numerous auxiliaries and its peliodicals,
has done much, both in this country and in Europe, to sow the seeds
of a far different spirit from that which has long prevailed even in the
far greater part of the Christian world.
CHAPTER CLXXXI.
Difficulties with Algiers.
1. THE difficulties between the United States and Algiers had
proceeded to such an extent, that, in 1812, the American consul was
suddenly ordered by the Dey to leave the capital. The immediate
excuse for a command so unexpected and so singular, was that a cargo
of naval and mnilitary stores, which our government had sent them,
were not satisfactory.
2. Whether the stores were really such as the Dey pretended, or
whether he made them the pretext for commencing anew his system
of piracy, is uncertain. One thing is, indeed, well known, which is

The subject was agitated in congress; and at length, some time in
March, they declared war against the Dey.
4. Soon after this, an American squadron, under the gallant Decatur, sailed for the Mediterranean, to make a descent upon the Algerines. On the 18th of June, 1815, they captured a frigate of forty-four
guns and six hundred men, and a brig. The victorious squadron then
sailed for Algiers, to humble the Dey, if possible, still further.
5. Such was the terror inspired by the American arms, that it was
not difficult to procure a treaty on our own terms. The Dey not only
agreed to give up the property and men he had taken from us, and
exempt us from tribute in time to come, but actually to pay six million dollars for previous damages. This treaty was signed July 4.
6. In the treaty of peace, made with Great Britain, one highly important subject hlad been left unfinished -the principles upon which
the commercial intercourse of the two nations should be based. A
meeting of plenipotentiaries, from the two countries, was therefore
held at London, in the summer of 1815, who, on the 3d of July, entered into an agreement on this subject.
7. This agreement, though it was made to be binding for four
years only, and was therefore to be considered only in the light of an
experiment, did not satisfy the American people. It was feared it
would interfere, in some of its provisions, with the commerce of the
country, already greatly crippled by war and embargoes. This fear,
however, appears to have been unfounded.

CHAPTER CLXXXII.
State of Indiana.
1. THE two principal events belonging to the history of the United
States, for the year 1816, were the establishment of the second Bank
of the United States, and the admission of Indiana to the Union, as
the nineteenth of its pillars.
2. The bill for the incorporation of a bank passed April 10th. Its
capital was thirty-five million dollars; of which seven millioni dollars
were to be subscribed by the United States, and twenty-eight million
dollars by individuals.  Its affairs were to be managed by iwenty-five
directors, five of whom were to be appointed by the president and senate, and twenty elected by the stockholders. The charter was limited
to twenty years.
3. With regard to the history of Indiana, little can be said, except
that it had been, for a long time prior to its settlement, the residence
of various Indian tribes, and the theatre of Indian wars. It was here
that the Shawanese resided, and that the bloody affray of Tippecanoe
took place.
4. How early the first white settlement was made, which is fairly
within the limits of Indiana, cannot now be determined. It was a
part of the great territory claimed by the French and traversed by
their traders.  It is quite certain that Vincennes, if not some other
posts, was settled at least one hundred and fifty years ago.
5. At the peace of 1763, Indiana, with the rest of the great northwestern territory, was given up by France to England. Still it was
claimed by the Indians, but, by the various treaties made with them
from time to time, extensive tracts were obtained for settlement. But
the Indian title to many parts of the state was retained till the year
1812, and even longer.
6. It was erected into a territorial government in 1809. In December, 1815, its inhabitants being found to amount to sixty thousand, a
petition was sent to congress to be made a separate state, which was
granted, as we have already seen. A constitution for the state was
formed, in the following December.

309to the savages, he determined to frighten them. However, he brought
forward the two cannon and a grindstone, but they thought thernm too
heavy to carry. He then discharged the cannon, loaded with stones,
among the trees, which so affected them that they were glad to return
to Powhatan with a quantity of toys and trinkets in their stead.
6. Powhatan was greatly pleased with the presents, but Indian
friendships are not always permanent. Some time afterward, his
savage feelings became again excited against the English, and a plan
was laid for cutting them all off at a blow, which, but for the interference of Pocahontas, would probably have succeeded. The day
and the hour were set, and Pocahontas was informed of both.
7. The very night before the deed was to be done, in the midst of
a terrible storm, which, with the thick darkness, kept the savages in
their huts, Pocahontas proceeded to Jamestown and revealed the plot.
The colonists were therefore on their guard, and a part of them saved.
This first plot to massacre the English took place in 1609.
8. It does not appear that the savages ever found out who revealed
their plan, for Pocahoniitas remained at her father's house for some
time afterward. In the mean time, with the aid of Captain Smith,
peace was once more established between the two nations.
9. Pocahontas, having now become the warm friend of the English, came every few days to the fort at Jamestown, with her basket
of corn for the garrison, which proved of great service to them. At
length, howvever, she was stolen by a foraging party of the white
people, and a large sum was demanded of her father for her ransom.
10. Powhatan was unwilling to comply with the terms proposed,
and began to prepare for a war on the English; and had it not been
for an event, as singular as it was unforeseen, a most exterminating
war would doubtless have arisen. A young man, by the name of
Rolfe, proposed to marry Pocahontas, and the proposal met the approbation of the king.
11. She'professed the faith of the Christian religion, and was baptized from a font hewn from the trunk of a tree, in the little rugged
church at Jamestown; and soon after was married. She became a
faithful wife and an exemplary and pious mothler. Some of the principal families in Virginia descended from this union of a young planter
with an Indian princess.
12. In 1616, Pocahontas went with her husband to Englrand, but
she was very unhappy there. Captain Smnith, who was in London at
the time of her arrival, called to see her, but, on account of her color,
was a little reserved in his manner of treatment. This added to the
intensity of her feelings, and she wept like a child.
13. Captain Smith inquired the cause of her grief. "Did I not
save thy life," said she, "in America t When I was torn from the
arms of my father, and conducted among thy friends, didst thou not
promise to be a father to me? Didst thou not say that if I went into

31310                    PRESIDENT MONROE.
CHAPTER CLXXXI[1.
President Monroe.
1. Tim year 1817 is chiefly distinguished, in the history of the
United States, as the beginning of Monroe's administration, and for
the admission of Mississippi to be the twentieth pillar of the American
Union.
2. Mr. Monroe was a very different man from Mr. Madison, his
predecessor in office. The latter was a man of great learning, as
well as of high talents as a statesman. He was a very active member
of the Continental Congress, and it is to him we are indebted, more
than any other man, for the adoption of the constitution under which
we live. Yet Mr. Madison was no warrior.
3. Mr. Monroe, on the contrary, though he entered upon his
administration in a time of peace and comparative prosperity, had
been a soldier. He was engaged in the revolutionary war from the
year 1776 to its close; and, though he held no other commission than
that of a captain of infantry, was in a number of severe battles, and,
at that of Trenton, was wounded. Yet he was a statesman, as well
as a warrior.
4. He came into office March 4, 1817. Daniel D. Tompkins was,
at the same time, elected vice-president. Though the prosperity of
the country was returning, yet it takes a long time for a nation tG
recover from a war, even in its commercial and financial concerns.

Manufactures were broken down, agriculture was far from being as
flourishing as it had been, and there was a great scarcity of money
especially of specie.
5. During the summer and autumn of this year, Mr. Monroe made
a tour through the northern and eastern states, to observe the condition of the fortifications along the sea-coast, as well as to make himself acquainted with the state of the country in other respects. A
similar tour was made, two years afterward, through the southern and
western states, and another still later about the shores of the Chesapeake Bay.
6. Mississippi was admitted to the Union on the 11th of December, 1817. This state was only the part of the great territory, south
of Tennessee and west of Georgia and contiguous to the Mississippi
river, which had hitherto gone by the general name of the Mississippi
Territory, and which, in 1800, had been incorporated by the government.
7. The early history of this country has been mentioned, in giving
a brief account of the travels of Ferdinando de Soto and La Salle. It
suffered greatly during the wars of the Natchez Indians. The Choctaws for a long time retained and occupied the northern part of this
state, and were in a good measure civilized.
8. There was also some trouble, this year, respecting Amelia
Island, which was a Spanish possession, and had become the resort of
a set of outlaws. The United States, though at peace with Spain, at
length determined to take possession of it. This was done by a naval
force. sent out for the purpose, and without bloodshed.
CHAPTER CLXXXIV.
War with the Seminole Indians.
1. BETWEEN the United States and Florida, or rather partIy
within the limits of both, there was a tribe of Indians called Seminoles. The nation also included, at this time, many of the Creek
Indians, who, dissatisfied with the treaty their brethren had mrnade
with the United States, in August, 1813, had fled to the Seminoles.
2. They also had among them    another set of runaways, much
worse than the vagabond Creeks. These were white traders from
various nations, who, for the most part, dissatisfied with the slow,
honest earnings of home, had come hither to gain money by trading
with, and often by taking advantage of, the Indians.

feelings against their white neighbors, and being also urged on by

the Creeks among them, began, about the close of the year 1817, to
commit outrages, after the usual Indian fashion, upon the families on
or near their borders.
4. Upon hearing of these outrages, the secretary of war ordered
General Jackson and General Gaines, with eight hundred regular
troops and one thousand militia, to proceed against them, and to call
upon the governors of the several adjacent states for more men, if
necessary. General Jackson, however, addressed a circular to the
patriots, as he called them, of West Tennessee, one thousand of
whom immediately joined him.
5. The war was immediately and vigorously prosecuted, but in a
way somewhat peculiar. St. Marks, a Spanish post, was first seized,
and afterward Pensacola, the capital of West Florida. These places
were taken because they favored, or were supposed to favor, the cause
of the Indians. There was very little resistance on the part of the
Spanish authorities.
6. The taking and occupying of these places, with somrne little
skirmishing elsewhere, occupied the time till late in the spring of
1818, when General Jackson announced that the Seminole war was
closed, and he returned to Nashville. General Jackson was much
censured for the manner of his proceeding in this war, notwithstanding his success. His appeal to the Tennesseans, and his seizing and
occupying St. Marks and Pensacola, were deemed exceedingly objectionable. His conduct was even brought before congress, and by
the senate partially condemned.
7. Illinois was admrnitted to the Union in 1818. Its early history
has been sufficiently given in connection with the travels of La Salle.
It was a part of Indiana till 1809, when it became a separate territory, in which condition it remained till it was received into the confederacy.
8. A treaty of peace, friendship, liberty of commerce, equalization
of duties, &amp;c., was concluded at Stockholm, in May of this year,
by Mr. Russel, the United States minister at the court of Sweden,
and signed by the respective governments during the summer and
autumn of the same year.

tmpressment. A   treaty with Spain was also made, settling the
boundary between this country and Mexico. At the same time, the
United States became bound to pay the Spanish government five
mnillion dollars, on account of injuries and losses which they had sustained from us.
2. On the 2d of March of this year, Alabama was admitted to tlie
Union. This was the twenty-second member of the confederacy.
Arkansas was made a territorial government the same year, but was
not formed into a state till nearly twenty years afterward.
3. Alabama, with its deep, rich soil, and, in many places, healthfil
and happy climate, remained, till after the revolutionary war, a mere
hunting-ground of the savages. From the peace of 1783, till 1802,
this territory was claimed by Georgia; and the lands were sold to
settlers and speculators accordingly.  
4. Among other sales was one of twenty-five million of acres for
five hundred thousand dollars; and the money was received and put
in the treasury.  But, at a subsequent meeting of the legislature, the
validity of the sale was called in question; and, finally, the records
respecting it were ordered to be burnt, and the money restored to the
purchasers.
5. In the year 1802, the state of Georgia ceded all her western
territory to the United States for twelve hundred and fifty thousand
dollars. This and the act by which the records were destroyed
occasioned law suits, which cost the parties great trouble and much
money. In 1800, as we have seen elsewhere, the present state of
Alabama became a part of the Mississippi Territory, -from which it
was separated when Mississippi became a state.
CHAPTER CLXXXVI.
States of Maine and Missouri.
1. IN the year 1638- the same year in which New Haven was
settled -Ferdinando Gorges obtained a charter from-the kingr, of all
the lands from the borders of New Hampshire, on the south-west, to
Sagadahoc, on Kennebec river, on the north-east, under the name of
the Province of Maine. It remained a separate province till the year
1652, when it became a part of Massachusetts.
2. The history of the settlement of this province has been alluded
to in connection with the history of the colony of Massachusetts.
Various attempts were made, during the progress of the eighteenth
century, to form it into an independent state, but none of them succeeded.

27STATES OF MAINE AND MLSOURI.
3. The most important of these attempts was made in 1785. A
convention met for the purpose at Portland.  The next year, the
question of a separation was submitted to the people in their town
meetings, on which it appeared that a majority of the freemrnen were
opposed to the measure. A similar attempt was made in 1802, and
with similar results.
4. In 1819, a large majority were found to be in favor of a separation. A convention was called, and a constitution prepared and
adopted, and, in 1820, Maine became the twenty-third pillar of the
American Union. At present, Maine has half a million, or more, of
inhabitants, and is not only large and populous, but flourishing.
5. Toward the end of the year 1820, when congress had come
together, the question was brought before them whether Missouri
should be admitted to the Union. The discussion of the question
involved another inquiry- that of the extension of slavery- and
occupied much of the session. Provision was, however, at length
made for its admission upon certain conditions  and these having
been complied with, Missouri, in August, 1821, became the twentyfourth state.
6. This state, together with all the territory belonging to the
United States west of the Mississippi river, was included in the purchase of Louisiana from the French, in the year 1803. Louisiana
was afterwards divided into the "Territory of Orleans," or Louisiana
proper, and the territory of Missouri.
7. In 1819, Missouri was divided into Arkansas, in the south, and
Missouri, in the north; and a portion of the northern or Missouri
division made application to congress to form a state constitution.
Since its admission, in 1821, its progress, in population and improvement, has been exceedingly rapid.
8. This state has been little disturbed by civil or internal divisions,
or by Indian wars. The worst trouble which has befallen it has
arisen from the appearance of a new sect there, in the year 1838,
called the Mormons, and from the attempts to crush their irregularities.
9. This singular people, believing themselves ill-treated, had
assembled, to the number of seven hundred. under their leaders. in a

CHAPTER CLXXXVII.
Florida.
1. DURING the session of congress which closed in the spring of
1823, a territorial government was established for Florida; and
William Duvall, of Kentucky, appointed by the president, with the
concurrence of the senate, to be the governor.
2. The unsuccessful attempt of Ponce de Leon to settle this
country has been mentioned in its place. The first permanent settlement here was made on the river May, in 1664. Even this came near
being broken up by starvation the next year. The settlers had been
at war with the natives -had lost many of their number; and those
who were alive had been obliged to live on acorns and roots.
3. Spain held the possession of Florida from the time of its discovery till 1763, when it was ceded to Great Britain. In 1781,
West Florida again fell into the hands of the Spanish; and, in a
treaty made in 1783, both provinces were given up to Spain, in
whose hands they remained, with the temporary interruption occasioned by the movements of General Jackson, till 1819.
4. In the progress of the year 1819, a transfer of the whole province was made, by treaty, to the United States. This treaty, aftelr
much delay, was finally ratified by Spain, and still more tardily
by the United States. This act, on the part of the United States,
took place in February, 1821; and possession was given in the following July.
5. This territory, at the census in 1840, contained fifty-four thousand four hundred and seventy-seven inhabitants, and in 1845 became
a state. Tallahassee, the seat of government, contained, in 1842,
about two thousand inhabitants; and is, probably, the largest town in
the state, except St. Augustine, which is about one fourth larger.
6. Slight changes were made, during the session of congress for
1822--3, with regard to the representation of the several states. At
first only one representative had been sent for every thirty thousand
inhabitants; the fractions, in each state, going for nothing. The
constitutionr had not, indeed, limnited the representation to this number.
but had only said that no more than one representative should be
sent for each thirty thousand people.
7. After the first census, it was fixed at one representative to
every thiirty-three thousand.  The same apportionment continued
under the second census, but at the third it was made one in thirtyfive thousand. In 1822-3, it was fixed, for the next ten years, at

1850 is one for seventy thousand six hunrdred and eighty.
CHAPTER CLXXXVIII.
La Fayettes tn the United States.
1. LA FAYETTE, having received an invitation from congress.
arrived at New York, August 13, 1824, and proceeded to the residence of Vice-President Tompkins, on Staten Island. He was soon
after escorted to New York by a splendid array of steamboats, decorated by the flags of almost every nation in the world, and bearing
thousands of citizens.
2. After remaining a few days in New York, he went to Boston,
where he met with the same cordial and joyful reception. He soon
after returned to New York, and visited Albany and the other towns
on the Hudson, after which he proceeded to Virginia, but returned to
Washington during the sitting of the next congress.
3. The next spring, after having passed through the southern and
western states, he again went to Boston. There, on the 17th of June,
two days after he arrived, he attended the fiftieth anniversary of the
battle of Bunker Hill; at which time, besides many demonstrations of
public joy, the corner-stone was laid of a monument. This monument was not finished, however, till 1842.
4. The excursions of La Fayette in this country occupied, in all,

about a year. In this time, he visited every one of the twventy-four
states. He was everywhere reeeived as a father to the country, and
his presence hailed with unmingled joy. The 7th of September was
the day appointed for his departure; and the frigate Brandywine was
appointed to convey him to his native country.
5. The parting scene was one of the most affecting which was ever
witnessed in this country. He was to sail fromrn Washington. All
business was suspended on that day, and all the officers of government, from the president downward, assembled to bid him farewell.
He was attended to the vessel by the whole population of Washington.
6. In passing Mount Vernon, he landed to pay a farewell visit to
the tomb of Washington, but immediately re/mbarked, and, by a
prosperous voyage, was soon once more in his native country. While
here, congress gave hlm two hundred thousand dollars and a township of land, as a partial compensation for his services during the
revolutionary struggle.
7. Nothing could have been more gratifying to the people of the
United States than' this visit of the illustrious stranger, whom, nrext
to Washington, they delighted to honor.
CHAPTER CLXXXIX.
Di/'cuZties with Georgia.
1. ON the 9th of February, 1825, John Q. Adams was chosen
president of the United States, and John C. Calhoun, of South Carolina, vice-president. In the case of Mr. Adams, there was no election
by the people. The choice, therefore, devolved, as at the first election of Jefferson, on the representatives.
2. About the time Mr. Adams' administration began, a controversy arose between Georgia and the national government, which
continued for some time. It had relation to certain lands, within the
state of Georgia, held by the Creek Indians, which Georgia claimed
as belonging to herself.
3. This controversy grew out of an agreement between the general government and Georgia, in 1802. In 1825, the Creeks became
excited, and a war seemed inevitable.
4. After a long negotiation at Washington, and much effort on the
part of the president and both houses of congress, the matter was
finally settled without a resort to arms, but not to the entire satisfaction of Georgia. This state long retained unpleasant feelings against
the president and his friends, though no man could deserve higher
praise for his conduct during the whole affair than he did.

5. This year, 1825, was remarkable for a spirit of speculation,
which prevailed in England and this country, especially in regard to
cotton. The price of this article rose from sixpence to sixteen pence
sterling, in the course of a few weeks. Many kinds of West India
goods also advanced with similar rapidity.

6. The price soon receded, and extensive bankruptcies were the
immediate consequence. The fictitious wealth, which the high prices
of goods had created, suddenly disappeared, and involved thousands
arnd tens of thousands in distress, and not a few in utter pecuniary
ruin.
CHAPTER CXC.
Death of Adams and Jefferson, 4/c.
1. THE most remarkable event of the year 1826 was the death of
the two ex-presidents, on the 4th of July, and within a very few
hours of each other. They had long been ill; but it was hardly to
be expected that they would both terminate their existence on this
particular day.

son, was a native of Virginia. He was born in the year 1743; and,
of course, was eighty-three years old when he died. He was bred a
lawyer, and his life was one of great activity, though he was much
less a warrior, or a civilian, than a statesman.
3. When the time came for preparing a declaration of independence, Jefferson was chairmani of the committee of five appointed for
this purpose. He drew the instrument with his own hand; nor was
it very materially altered by congress.
4. Besides being a member of congress for many years, he was
many years abroad as minister to France and Great Britain. After
the close of his second term as president, he retired to Monticello,
in Virginia, where he spent the remainder of his days, chiefly employed in study.
5. Adams was a native of Quincy, ilear Boston, but was eight
years older than Jefferson. He, too, was bred a lawyer, but, like
Jefferson, did not long practise his profession. T'rhe war of the revolution soon called him into such scenes of bustling activity as gave
him little time for legal practice.
6. He was early a member of the colonial congresses, and among
the first to resist the high-handed measures of Great Britain. He
nominated Washington as the commander-in-chief of the army. He
was second on the committee, already alluded to, appointed to draft a
declaration of independence; and, like Jefferson, was one of the first
to sign it.
7. In regard to his character, the best eulogium has been given by
Jefferson. He always said that "the great pillar of support to the
Declaration of Independence, and its ablest advocate and champion on
the floor of the house, was John Adams;" and no mnan knew him

8. Though feeble at the arzival of the fiftieth anniversary of independence, he had expressed, like Jefferson, a strong desire to live to
see that day, though he hardly expected it. But he kInew enoug.h,
on the fourth, to know it had arrived; and said, "It is a great and
glorious day."  His last words were, "Jefferson survives."
9. Madison and Monroe lived several years longer. Monroe died
in New York, July 4, 1831, aged seventy-three; this making the
third president who had died on the anniversary of our independence.
Madison died June 28, 1837, aged eighty-six years.

14. Captain Smith could not resist such eloquence. He introduced her to many families of respectability, and did all he could,
while she remained in England, to make her happy, except that he
never ventured to bring her before the king. She fell a victim to the
united influence of grief and the climate, and died at the age of twenty-two, as she was about to embark for America
CHAPTER XV.
Captain Smith's voyage of discovery.
1. DURING the captivity of Captain Smith, he had been carried in
triumph, by the Indians, from the Chickahominy river, to their villages on the Rappahannoc and Potomac, and thence through their
other settlements to the Pamunkey river, and finally to the lower residence of Powhatan, in what is now called Gloucester county.
3. "It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good," says an old,
but current and just maxim; and the captivity of Smith, though an
evil in itself, had its advantages. It gave him such a knowledge of
the country, and of the character and condition of the native inhabitants, as proved to be of the highest importance afterward, botn to him
and the colony.
3. We have seen already that the number of the settlers at Jamestown had been much diminished before the massacre of the men who
went out with Smith. Some had also died during his absence.
From one hundred and five, who came over, he found them reduced,
on his return, to forty, and of these a part were just contriving to
desert the colony.
4. Attempts had been made at desertion twice before. Captain
Smith resolved to put a stop to this, even if it cost him his life; and
he succeeded in doing so. But the state of things in Jamestown was
exceedingly discouraging; the government was of no force whatever,
and everything would have gone to ruin, but for his courage and
determination.
5. At this critical period in the history of the colony, Captain Newport arrived from England, with 120 emigrants. The news of his
arrival in James river raised the drooping courage of the people and
diffused general joy. It is not improbable that the point on the James
river, which is known by the name of "Newport's News," is the
point from which his vessel was first discovered.

CHAPTER CXCI.
President Jackson.
General Jackson.
1. FEw events worthy of note occurred in the year 1827. During
the session of congress, which commenced December 4th of that
year, a bill was passed for the revision of the tariff of the United
States; but it did not give universal satisfaction. Some thought it
encouraged domestic manufactures, &amp;c., too much; others, too little.
2. The year 1828 was distinguished for party strife in the election of a president. The two opposing candidates were Adams, the
incumbent, and General Jackson.   The result of the contest was
the election of General Jackson by a large majority  one hundred
and seventy-eight of the votes of the people being given for him, and
only eighty-three for Adams. It was a majority which even the
friends of General Jackson himself hardly expected.  His administration was begun by the appointment of a new cabinet, and by the
removal from office of a great numiber of individuals in the country
known to be unfriendly to his election.
3. During the year 1829, John Jay, of Bedford, New York, died,
at the age of eighty-four. Hie was one of the presidents of the old
continental congress; and, without a doubt, was one of the greatest
men of his day. He was a good man as well as a great one.

her, 1830, a rupture took place between the president and vice-president, which produced other animosities and divisions; and, on the
20th of April, 1831, the cabinet officers of the president all resigned.
During the summer, however, a new cabinet was organized.
5. A treaty of peace and commerce was made, in the year 1830,
between the United States and the government of Turkey; a commercial treaty was also concluded with Mexico. Just before President Jackson came into office, General Harrison, afterwards President
Harrison, was made the United States' minister plenipotentiary to
Colombia.
6. On the 10th of December, 1832, Jackson issued his celebrated
proclamnation against the nullifiers of South Carolina. These persons
maintained that any one of the states might set aside, or nullify, any
act of congress which they deemed unconstitutional and oppressive.
They called themselves the "state rights party," inasmuch as they
asserted the rights of the states to be supreme.
7. These views had been entertained from the adoption of the
constitution by a few individuals; but, until the period of which we
are now speaking, they had not produced any serious results. The
chief occasion of the proceedings in South Carolina, already adverted
to, was the existing tariff laws. Conventions of that state passed
resolutions declaring these to be null and void; and formidable preparations were made to resist their execution.
8. President Jackson's proclamation was aimed at these proceedings. Great anxiety and alarm prevailed in the country, and an
apprehension was entertained that the union was soon to be severed
by the open rebellion of the state of South Carolina. In this state of
things, parties and contests were momentarily forgotten, and even
the opposers of the president rallied on the side of his proclamation.
Few were found, except those of the state rights party of South Carolina, to sustain the movements of the nullifiers.
9. The difficulty was at length pacified by the Compromise Act,
brought forward by Mr. Clay, in the senate of the United States, and
passed in 1833. This act provided for a gradual reduction of duties
until the year 1843, when they should sink to the generallevel of
twenty per cent.
10. This compromise act went into operation, and continued till
1842, when it was superseded by a new tariff system, as will be hereafter related.

CHAPTER CXCII.
President Jackson's Second Term.
1. ON counting the votes for president and vice-president of the
United States, in the early part of the year 1833, President Jackson
was found to be reelected by an overwhelming majority; and Martin
Van Buren was chosen vice-president.
2. One of the early acts of the president, during his second administration, was to pay a visit, May 6, in company with the members of
his cabinet and others, to Fredericksburg, to witness the ceremony of
laying a corner-stone of a monument to the mother of Washington.
3. While the steamboat which conveyed them was on the way
from Washington to Alexandria, as the president and others were
sitting at dinner, a dastardly assault was made, by one Randolph,
late a lieutenant in the navy, on the president. The company, however, interfered, so that Randolph only inflicted a single blow in the
face.
4. It may not be out of place to say here that the centennial birthday of Washington was celebrated with great pomp and rejoicing
throughout the United States, on the 22d of February, 1832, or a
little more than a year before the corner-stone was laid of a monument to his mother's memory.
5. On the 6th of June, 1833, the president, with most of his cabinet, set oult on a tour through the New England states. The objects
of this tour were similar to those of his predecessors, Washington
and Monroe; and he was received everywhere with similar demonstrations of respect.

6. In the autumn of this year, the president came to the conclusion that the public deposits ought to be removed from the Bank of
the United States to the state banks. He deemed this change necessary, as he said, in order " to preserve the morals of the people, the
freedom of the press, and the purity of the elective franchise."'
7. This was the beginning of a contest in congress, respecting the
deposits, which continued a long time, and created much excitement
throughout the country. The deposits were, however, at length removed. In January, 1835, an attempt was made by an insane man,
named Lawrence, to assassinate the president, which, however, proved
unsuccessful.
8. General Jackson having been president two terms, died at his
residence, called the Hermitage, near Nashville, Tennessee, June 8,
1845, aged 78. His parents were Irish, who settled in South Carolina, where he was born in 1767
CHAPTER CXCIII.
State of Arkansas. -Inbzdian Territory.
1. ARXANSAS was admitted to the Union, as a separate, independent state, in the year 1836. This state lies southward of Missouri,
and was originally, as we have elsewhere seen, a part of it. From
its natural character, it is destined to be, at no distant day, a verv important member of the confederacy.

was made at the Indian village of Arkansas, on the river of that

name, in the year 1685. The first inhabitants, and the emigrants
who joined them for many years, were French. The progress of
the colony was very slow. It is scarcely twenty years since the tide
of emigration from the Atlantic states began to flow in that direction.
3.'Little Rock, the early seat of government for Arkansas, was
laid out in 1820. The first steamboat ascended the river that year.
It was eight days in going from New Orleans to the village of Arkansas, which is scarcely one hundred miles above the mouth of the Arkansas river.
4. Already does this infant state contain more inhabitants than
Rhode Island or Delaware. The number, in 1840, was ninety-seven
thousand five hundred and seventy-four. The state is divided into
forty counties. The population of Little Rock, the capital, is about
six thousand.
5. Arkansas formerly contained within its bosom the remnants of
several once numerous and powerful tribes of Indians. By a treaty
made between the United States and the Cherokees, in 1833, the latter agreed to give up to the United States, for a sum equal to five
millions of dollars, or more, all their lands east of the Mississippi,
and to retire to a region, to be guaranteed to them. in the present
state of Arkansas.
6. Since this time, most of the Indian tribes, including, beside the
Cherokees, the Chickasaws, Choctaws, Creeks, Seminoles, Senecas,
and many others, have been removed to a tract between the states of
Missouri and Arkansas on the east, and the Rocky Mountains on
the west. This is called the Indian Territory.
7. The soil is excellent here, and some of the tribes are making
advances in civilization. The land is guaranteed to them by the
United States. The Choctaws and Cherokees have written constitutions, laws, books, churches, and well-cultivated farms. Other tribes
have made similar, though not equal progress. The whole number
of Indians in this territory is probably 70,000.
CHAPTER CXCIV.
The Florida War, 4.c.
1. NEAR the close of the year 1835, a war broke out in Florida,
the residence of the Seminole and Creek Indians. One of the first
conflicts was near Fort Crum, between a party of fifty or sixty Seminoles and a somewhat smaller number of United States militia- of
the latter, eight were killed and seven wounded.

and men, belonging to the United States army, were attacked near

Tampa Bay by an overwhelming body of Seminole Indians, and all,
except three, were slain. These three.were wounded, but escaped.
The dead bodies of the rest were found, fifty-three days afterward,,nmutilated, and were duly buried.
3. Another battle was fought at Withlacoochie, between nearly
three hundred United States' troops and three hundred Indians. The
Indians had forty killed; the other party a much smaller number.
4. The war continued to rage in 1836. On the 27th of April, in
a battle near Fort Brooke, in Florida, two hundred Indians were
killed and wounded. On the 15th of May, the village of Roanoke,
on the Chattahoochee river, was attacked and stormed by three hundred or four hundred Indians, and burnt to ashes, and a few were
slain. On the 26th, the Creeks were defeated by the Alabama troops,
with the loss of four hundred of their men.
5. On the 17th of July, General Jessup addressed an official letter
to the adjutant general of the United States' army, announcing that
the Florida war was termiiiated. He even made a treaty with the
Indians, in March, 1837.
6. In the autumn of. the same year, however, the latter resumed
hostilities. On the 20th of November, Osceola and another Seminole
chief and fifty warriors were taken prisoners. In December, another
battle was fought, in which twenty-eight of the United States' troops
were killed and one hvundred and eleven wounded. Again, January
24, 1838, the Indians were defeated by General Jessup.

war. The Indians, by an agreement with General Macomb, were to
retire into a particular district in Florida, and there remain unmolested.
Yet, on the 23d July, the same year, we find them making an attack
on Colonel Harney, of the United States' troops.
8. The United States also sent out to the West Indies for bloodhounds to aid in expelling the savages from the swamps, in which
they were wont to hide. These, however, were ineffectual. The
war was continued till 1842, when it was finally terminated. In this
conflict the Seminoles displayed great talent and perseverance, and
subjected the United States to an immense loss of blood and treasure.
9. In the autumn of 1836, about thirty Indian chiefs and warriors, of the Sacs and Foxes, were carried, on a visit, through
some of the principal cities of the United States, and at length arrived
in Boston, where they were received with much ceremony. They
were exhibited at the State House and Faneuil Hall. The celebrated
Black Hawk was among thernm.

Michigan.

Union as a state, passed the house-of representatives by a large
majority; and, on the 26th, received the sanction of the president.
2. Michigan had contained sixty thousand inhabitants, the usual
number required of a new state as one of the qualifications for admission, long before this time, but difficulties had presented themselves
which were not adjusted till now. The population, in 1837, was
nearly two hundred thousand; in 1840, it was two hundred and
twelve thousand two hundred and sixty-seven.
3. The Michigan territory, when first discovered by the white people, was inhabited by a tribe of Indians called Hurons. Many of these
were converted to Christianity by the Jesuits, as early as 1648. It
was not, however, till 1670, that the French took possession of the
territory, and built two forts, one at Detroit and another at Michilimackinac; nor was it really settled till thirty years after.
4. The progress of the settlements, under the French, was exceedingly slow. It was not till the year 1763,;when, by a treaty between
Great Britain and France, it was ceded to the former, that much was
done in the way of civilization and improvement. Little was done till
after the peace of 1783, when the territory was given up by Great
Britain to the United States.
5. Until about the year 1800, this territory, for the purposes of
government, was considered a part of the great north-western territory.
After Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois had been severally detached, the
remainder, in 1805, became a distinct territory, of which President
Jefferson made General Hull the first governor.
6. Michigan was still doomed to much suffering, especially from
the war of 1812. For almost two years, nearly the whole territory
was the theatre of war, and was exposed to the barbarity of two
nationis. Michigan is now in a fair way to become one of the most
respectable members of the confederacy.
CHAPTER CXCVI.
President Van Buren.
1. ON the 4th of March, 1837, Martin Van Buren was inaugurated
as the eighth president of the United States. As there was no choice
of a vice-president by the people, the senate proceeded according to
the manner prescribed by the constitution, and elected Richard M.
Johlnson vice-president.
2. On the 15th of May, the president issued a proclamation requiring. the congress of the United States to meet on the first Monday of

September, "on account of great and weighty matters claiming their
consideration."
3. These had relation to the financial condition of the country.
During the months of March and April, 1837, the most unprecedented
embarrassments were experienced among the mercantile people of the
United States; especially in the large cities and towvns. Suspensions
and failures in business became of every-day occurrence. In May,
the number of heavy failures, in New York, to say nothing of smaller
ones, had risen to two hundred and sixty.
4. In New Orleans, the difficulties were also equally great. In
two days, houses stopped payment there, the aggregate of whose
debts was more than twenty-seven million dollars. In Boston, the
suffering was severe, but not so great as in many other places. From
November, 1836, to May, 1837, there were seventy-eight large failures
and ninety small ones- in all, one hundred and sixty-eight. In
addition to these evils the national treasury was itself suddenly
plunged into a state of bankruptcy.
5. These distresses were, to a very great extent, charged upon the
government and its measures, and upon the then present and preceding administration. Especially was it attempted to trace the difficulties to the war which had been made upon the United States' Bank,
and the passing of certain laws which had drained the country too
suddenly of its specie.
6. About the middle of May, 1837, nearly all the banks, from
Boston to Baltimore, suspended specie payments; and their example

was soon followed by the moneyed institutions throughout the country.
The state of New York passed a law to make the suspension of specie
payments, by its banks, for one year, valid.
7. The extra session of congress, which had been called in view
of the state of the country, continued till the fourth Monday of
December. The people, who had attributed the existing evils to the
action of government, looked to that source for a remedy. Congress,
however, did little more than to adopt measures for replenishing the
treasury of the United States.
8. The financial evils of the country continued rather to increase
than diminish. A general panic prevailed, and as the bank notes
were, to a great extent, withdrawn from circulation, and as the currency of the country was diminished, commodities fell in due proportion. Under the influence of distrust, property of all kinds lost its
value, and a general state of depression and paralysis continued till
the year 1842.
9. A species of insurrection having, during the year 1837, broken
out in Canada, and some of our restless and lawless citizens on the
frontier having taken part in it, President Van Buren, on the 5th of
January, 1838, issued a proclamation to such persons to return peaceably to their homes, on penalty of being punished according to the
existing laws of the United States.
10. On the 14th of the same month, a body of about five hundred
American and Canadian troops, on Navy Island, near Niagara Falls,
evacuated the island, surrendered the arms belonging to the United
States and-the cannon belonging to the state of New York, and disMay, 18377 7. What xvas done by congress? 8. What was the state of the country

men," -as the settlers called them - and goldsmiths. The latter,
no doubt, came over, filled with the idea of obtaining gold. None of
them, however, expected to earn their living by hard work. All
they thought or talked of, was about digging, washing, refining and
carrying away the most precious of metals.
7. Even Martin, one of the council, and Captain Newport himself,
became absorbed -if indeed their brains were not actually turnedwith the idea of finding gold. Martin claimed, no doubt sincerely,
that he had discovered a gold mine, and Newport, after loading his
vessel with what proved to be worthless yellow earth, believed himself to be rich, and returned to England.
8. Worn out with fruitless endeavors to direct the attention of his
people to something more important than searching for gold, Captain
Smith undertook to explore the inlets, rivers and shores of the Chesapeake Bay. This he accomplished, in the course of two voyages, in
an open boat, and with only fourteen men.
9. These voyages were undertaken and completed in about three
months. He ascended the Potomac, above where Washington now
stands, discovered and explored the Patapsco, and, it is thought,
entered the harbor of Baltimore. The whole distance travelled was
estimated at about 3000 miles.
10. But to explore, merely, was not all that Captain Smith accomplished. He journeyed into the interior, and made treaties of
peace and friendship with many tribes of the natives. He also prepared and sent over to the London Company, a map of the country,
which is still to be seen, and is very correct. This expedition, considering all the circumstances, is one of the most wonderful on record;
and displays not only skill and perseverance in Smith, but far-sighted
and statesman-like wisdom.
CHAPTER XVI.
Smith's administration of the government.
1. IN three days after his return from his second voyage up the
Chesapeake Bay, Captain Smith - not yet thirty years of age - was
made president of the Virginia council. It is worthy of remark that
of the seven members of the council who came over about a year
before, all but Smith and Kendall were now dead, or degraded, or
devoted to the gold business.
2. Not long after the appointment of Smith as president, Captain
Newport came out from England with seventy more emigrants, two
of whom were females. Of nearly 300 emigrants, who had now
come over, these appear to have been the only females who had as
yet ventured to join the colony.

banded. They, however, took a hostile position, soon afterward, at
Bois Blanc, near Detroit, and continued their hostile designs.
11. On the 1st of March following, about six hundred more of the
patriots, as they called themselves, under the command of Dr. Robert
Nelson and Colonel Cote, surrendered themselves to General Wool,
of the United States army, near the Canada line, in Vermont; and
the border war seemed at length to be over.
12. But the troubles were not yet at an end. An attempt was
made, November 13, by about three hundred Canadians and inhabitants of the United States, to take Prescott, in Upper Canada.
Between the 13th and 16th, one hundred and two of them were killed
and sixty taken prisoners. On the 16th, one hundred more surrendered near Prescott. The rest fled to the woods.
13. President Van Buren now issued a second proclamation, the
object of which was to warn all who should persist in the scheme of
invading Canada, that, to whatever miseries or sufferings they might
reduce themselves, or become reduced, the government of the United
States would never interfere in their behalf; but they must be left to
the consequences of their folly. This course appears to have had its
due effect.
CHAPTER CXCVII.
Public Improvements.-     Progress of Events.
1. THE pecuniary difficulties of the country did not wholly prevent
the diffusion of intelligence or the spread of a zeal for public improvement. Indeed, a zeal for literary and moral culture seems to have
pervaded, unusually, all ranks and classes of the community. Several
national measures, for literary and scientific improvement, were agitated.
2. On the 17th of December, 1835, the president of the United
States communicated to congress a report of the secretary of state
relating to a bequest of one hundred thousand pounds sterling, or
about five hundred thousand dollars, from James Smithson, of London,
to the United States, for the purpose of founding at Washington an
establishment to be called "The Smithsonian Institution, for the
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men."
3. This bequest created, at first, quite a sensation in the United
States, and a good deal of interest was manifested with regard to its
proper application. The subject was permitted to rest till the year
1846, when an act was passed for establishing the Smithsonian Institution, at Washington. It is devoted to scientific purposes, and an
amnple building is erected for its use.

1836, during which the patent-office and post-office were burnt.
Among the contents of the patent-office were seven thousand models
of patents, out of ten thousand which had been granted by congress;
one hundred and sixty-three large folio volumes of records; twentysix large port-folios, containing nine thousand valuable drawings, and
ten thousand original descriptions of inventions.
5. It was a most severe calamity to the country, and calculated to
damp, in no small degree, the rising spirit of public improvement.
The misfortune was the more to be regretted, as it was believed to be
the work of incendiaries. It is gratifying to know, however, that,
through the activity of Mr. Ellsworth, the superintendent, the loss by
the fire was, in a great measure, repaired.
6. On the 18th of August, 1838, the Vincennes, a sloop of war,
of twenty guns, the Peacock, of eighteen guns, the Porpoise, of ten
guns, and three smaller vessels, set out on an exploring expedition,
having on board a number of distinguished and learned men, in the
various departments of natural science. The fleet set sail from
Hampton Roads, in Virginia.
7. The squadron returned in June, 1842, after an absence of nearly
four years, having circumnavigated the globe, and visited and actually
surveyed many parts before nearly unknown. It accomplished fully
the object for which it was designed. The various vessels of the
squadron sailed, duhing their absence, about four hundred thousand
miles.  Only eight of the men died of disease during the whole term
of absence.
8. Among other things, the squadron brought home a large and
valuable collection of live plants, bulbs, &amp;c., collected in the islands
of the Pacific, at the Cape of Good Hope, and elsewhere, which were
placed in a garden at Washington. They brought a valuable collection of prepared specimens of plants and animals, which are now
deposited in the patent-office at Washington.  They also brought
with them a chief of the Figi Islands: who, with others, had massacred and eaten the crew of a brig from Salem, Massachusetts. Thev
also discovered, January 19, 1840, the coasts of an Antarctic continent.
9. The proceedings against the Bank of the United States, with the
removal of the public deposits, and the discussioni which grew out of
it, led to the introduction of a bill into congress, called the SubTreasury or Independent Treasury bill; which, during the session of
1839-40, underwent a thorough final discussion.
10. The object of this bill was to provide for the collection, safekeeping, transfer, and disbursement of the public revenue of the
Uniited States, without any connection with, or dependence on,
banks. A part of the plan was to have the revenue, after a reasoinable time, wholly paid in gold and silver of the United States currency.

of January, 1840, but did not pass the house of representatives till the
30th of June following. It was so radical a change that it created a
very strong sensation throughout the United States, and was repealed
immediately after the accession of General Harrison to the presidency.
It was, however, restored on the accession of Mr. Polk, in 1845.
CHAPTER CXCVIII.
Harrison.- Tyler.    Polk.-   Taylor.
1. THE events of Mr. Van Buren's administration had produced
a strong excitement throughout the United States, and, consequently,
during the canvass for the presidency in 1840, an extraordinary
interest was displayed by the people. The opponents of the administration party nominated General William Henry INarrison against Van
Buren, and he was elected by a very large majority of the votes of the
people.  Mr. John Tyler, of Virginia, was, at the same time, chosen
vice-president
2. A new cabinet was immediately organized, and, in view of the
state of public sentiment and the condition of the country, an extra
session of congress was ordered; but, in the midst of his career, General Harrison was seized with sickness, and died in about one montkl
after his inauguration.

3. The constitution of the United States provides that, in case of
the death of the chief magistrate, the vice-president shall be his successor. Mr. Tyler was, therefore, the constitutional successor of
President Harrison, and early entered upon the discharge of his duties
4. The extra session of congress called by General Harlrison com
inenced on the 31st day of May, 1841, and continued to the 13th day
of September. Several important measures were brought forward,
and either adopted or defeated. The sub-treasury was repealed, and,
after much discussion, a general bankrupt law was passed. Two
several bills passed both houses of congress, chartering a new bank
of the United States, but they were vetoed by President Tyler.
5. This course, on the part of the chief magistrate, was regarded
by the party who had elected him as a violation of his pledges; and,
consequently, a state of complete alienation grew up between him and
those to whom he was indebted for his election. His entire cabinet,
with one exception, resigned, and the president was generally denounced by his late supporters.
6 In 1842, several important events occurred. A treaty was
negotiated at Washington between Mr. Webster, on the part of the
United States, and Lord Ashburton, on the part of Great Britain,
which has since been ratified by the two countries. The treaty happily adjusted the dispute in relation to the north-eastern boundary of
the United States, which had existed for almost thirty years, and had
actually produced hostilities between the state of M/aine and the province of New Brunswick.

7. It also settled several other difficulties existing between the two
countries, and dissipated the prospects of war, which had long been
threatened. The negotiations were conducted with great frankness
and fairness on the part of the two diplomatists, and bear a singular
contrast to the artifice and trick which have generally marked national
diplomacy. We may, at least, hope that an example, so consonant
to the enlightened age in which we live, shall become the guide of all
fuLture statesmen.
8. At the close of the session of congress, in 1842, a new tariff act
was passed, after an elaborate discussion, designed to give encouragement to the various industrial pursuits of our own country, as well as
to supply the treasury of the general government.     This act was followed by a speedy revival of trade -a restoration of commercial coIifidence, and a return of prosperity throughout the land.*
9. The year 1842 was signalized by a rebellion in Rhode Island,
headed by Thomas W. Dorr, a lawyer of that state.        The design of
this mnovement was to set aside the ancient charter of that state, which
still continued to be its constitution, and this was to be done by spontaneous and unauthorized acts of the people, and not according to legal
forms.
10. The opposers of this movement, called the charter party, were
willing to adopt a new and more liberal constitution, but they main1842. What has been the effect of the treaty negotiated between Great Britain and the

tained that this should be done in a legal and authentic manner.
Upon the mode of forming a new constitution, parties were formed,
and a violent state of excitement followed.
11. The revolutionary party actually proceeded to the formation
and adoption of a constitution, and elected Dorr as governor, with a
legislature. These met at Providence, in 1843, passed various acts,
and adjourned.
12. Matters soon came to a crisis. The existing government
caused several persons, engaged in this movement, to be arrested,
and Dorr resorted to arms. With a small band of followers, he
threatened to attack the arsenal at Providence, but being deserted by
a part of his adherents, he fled; on the borders of the state he collected a number of persons, most of them from the city of New York
and the states adjacent to Rhode Island, and, proceeding to the village
of Chepachet, began to entrench himself there.
13. IHe had, it is supposed, about fifteen hundred men, but the
government of the state had now assembled a large force, and these
began their march upon the rebels. Perceiving the hopelessness of
his enterprise, and now finding that a large majority of the people of
the state were opposed to his proceedings, Dorr took flight, and his
men were speedily dispersed. Subsequent to this, the friends of law
and order in the state have succeeded in forming and establishing a new
constitution, according to the prescribed forms, and this has quietly
gone into full operation, by the sanction of a large majority of the
people. Dorr was tried and imprisoned, but afterwards released.  
14. The summer of 1843 was marked by one of the most brilliant
spectacles that has ever been witnessed in the United States. On
the 17th of June, an immense concourse of people was assembled at
the foot of Bunker Hill to celebrate the completion of the noble monument, erected in commemoration of the battle that was fought there
sixty-eight years before, and which marks the very spot where the
patriotic Warren fell.
15. In the presence of nearly thirty thousand spectators, among
whom were the president of the United States and his cabinet, Mr.
Webster pronounced one of the most impressive orations that ever fell
from human lips.
16. This interesting ceremonial drew to the city of Boston an immense concourse of people, and it was remarked, as a grateful tribute
to the high state of civilization which characterizes the people, that
though one hundred and fifty thousand strangers were that day in the
city, not an instance of riot occurred, nor was a solitary individual
sent to the watch-house during the ensuing night. We may at least
hope and believe that, in spite of the various convulsions which have
occurred for the last few years, the standard of morals is higher than
at any former period of our history.

ported by the democrats. The latter was elected, and was duly inaugurated March 4, 1845.
18. During this year, bills for the admission of two new states into
the Union, Iowa and Florida, were passed by Congress. The first
was rejected by the people of that territory; the latter was accepted,
and Florida, as already stated, became one of the United States.
19. A bill was also passed in 1845 for the annexation of Texas to
the Union, and the act has since been consummated, though strenuously opposed by the whig party throughout the country. Texas was
soon admitted into the Union, and, at the time, formed the twentyeighth member of the confederacy. Iowa was admitted in 1846, and
Wisconsin in 1848. Thus the present number of states in the Union
is thirty.
20. At the time Texas was annexed to the United States, Mexico
was making war upon it, as a revolted province. By command of the
president of the United States, Colonel Taylor took post near the Rio
Grande, with a small army. Hostilities commenced between the
Americans and Mexicans, in April, 1846, and in May following, two
battles were fought, in which the former were victorious.
21. War was declared by congress, May 12, and the American forces
under Taylor entered the Mexican territory, captured the important
town of Monterey, and with four thousand seven hundred men, beat
the Mexicans, under Santa Anna, with twenty-two thousand. This
extraordinary battle took place at Buena Vista, February 22, 1847.
22. The fortress and town of Vera Cruz were captured under General Scott, March 29; and soon after, at Cerra Gordo, the Americans,
under the same leader, vanquished Santa Anna. The latter had
twelve thousand men, in a strong position, and Scott eight thousand
five hundred. The contest was severe and bloody on both sides.
23. Scott pushed on toward the city of Mexico, which was captured, after several severe engagements, September 12, 1847. In all
these battles the Americans displayed extraordinary courage and skill,
often contending with thrice their numbers. and in every important
case being victorious.
24.'The chief towns as well as the capital of Mexico were now in
the hands of the Americans. Further resistance was vain, and negotiations for peace being commenced, a treaty was finally ratified, May
30, 1848. One of the conditions of this transferred to the United
States a large tract of territory, extending from the western boundary
of Texas to the Pacific, and including New Mexico and the northern
portion of California.
25. On the 23d of February, 1848, John Quincy Adams, former
president of the United States, died in the capitol at Washington, he
being a member of the house of representatives, from Massachusetts.
This event caused a great sensation throughout the United States.
26. In the autumn of 1848, (Nov. 7,) the election for presideiit and
vice-president of the United States took place, under a new law of

congress. The democratic candidates were Lewis Cass, of Michigan,
and W. O. Butler, of Kentucky. The whig candidates were General
Taylor, of Louisiana, and Millard Fillmore, of New York.    The
latter were chosen by a considerable majority.
27. About this time it was discovered that immense quantities of
gold existed along the banks of the Sacramento, in California; and
during the year 1849, thousands of people flocked thither, from all
quarters of the globe, to gather this precious metal.
CHAPTER       CXCIX.-Pzblic Improvements, &amp;c.
1. IN pursuing the thread of our nairative, we have omitted various occurrences of interest and imiportance, having direct connection
with the peace and happiness of the country.  The last forty years
have been distinguished, throughout the civilized world, for an immense improvement in useful knowledge, and the United States have
not been tardy in this great march of mind.
2. The present century is remarkable for the advances it has made
in science. This has resulted from a wiser philosophy, which has led
men of learning to throw aside theory, and seek truth through experiment and the accumulation of facts. But the most remarkable characteristic of the age is the application of science to the arts of life.
3. In the United States, this topic is to be considered in two points
of view- the results of science are diffused, by means of the press,
through all classes of the people; and hundreds of thousands of our
farmers, mechanics and men of business, are well acquainted with the
useful parts of chemistry, mrnineralogy, geology and zoology.
4. It is in consequence of this diffusion, that we see so many useful
inventions devised by our ingenious countrymen. Philosophy is no
longer a mysterious power, holding itself aloof from mankind, but it is
like a strong man, with sleeve rolled up and brawny arm, on the railroad track, in the smithy, the factory and the workshop, ministering
to the daily comfort of the million.
S. Am.ong the particular improvements which claim our notice, we
must mention the avilic.ation of steam to navigation.  This, as we
have already stated, was first accomplished, in 1i07, by our countryman, Robert Fulton, and has since been diffused throughout the world.
This was one of the greatest achievements of human ingenuity, and
has perhaps increased the power of man at least three-fold. Even the
oceans are now traversed by steam vessels. and the Atlantic, before so
formidable a barrier between the two continents, is now regularly
traversed in fourteen days.
6. In 1817, an enterprise was commenced by the state of New
York, of great importance in itself, and still more useful by the impulse its successful completion gave to internal improvements. This
was the great canal from Albany to Buffalo, a distance of three hun

dred and sixty-three miles, and which was designed to connect the
waters of the Hudson with the great north-western lakes.
7. Under the auspices of De Witt Clinton, a man of patriotic and
expansive views, this mighty enterprise was accomplished, and is now
the channel by which the products of the west find their way, in lavish
abundance, from the distant interior to a thousand markets along the
borders of the Atlantic Ocean.  Other canals of the greatest utility
have been executed in various parts of the country.
8. In the year 1831, railroads were established in England for the
purposes of public transportation. They were soon adopted in this
country, and have now become familiar to every traveller. The
average speed of these conveyances is twenty-five miles the hour.
Thus, remote cities are practically drawn near together, an another
mighty stride is taken in increasing the pm-"er of man. Without
wings, he still flie _ *p6n his journey, almost with the speed of the
bira_.
9. There have been other improvements in the country, less striking to the eye, but not less important to the welfare of society. A
great movement has been made in behalf of common school education,
and there is now hardly a state in the Union that has not adopted a
plan for the education of all class'es at the public expense. In many
parts of the country, the free schools, open to all, are the best that
can be found.
10. We may notice one topic more, and that is, the progress of
Temperance. The aim of this great movement is to extinguish the
use of intoxicating liquors, and thus annihilate one of the most pro6. Describe the great Erie canal. What is its length? 7. Under whose auspices was it

lific sources of human misery, vice, and crime. It is a cause which
has advanced with an irresistible impulse; yet, aided by rio force
of law, its strength has been derived wholly from the moral sense
of society- a fact which proves the elevated standard of morals, and
shows that the cause of truth is best served by appeals to the reason
and conscience of mankind.
11. The most wonderful triumph of art is yet to be noticed - the
mrnagnetic telegraph. This consists of lines of wires, attached to tall
posts, and extending from one place to another. At given points
there is machinery forworking the telegraph. The lines now extend
from Boston to Buffalo and Canada, and also from Boston to New
York, and the principal cities southward to New Orleans.
12. By means of this admirable device, for which we are indebted
to Mr. Morse, of New York, intelligence may be carried with the
speed of lightning. A man at Boston may, in the space of a few
minutes, send information to a friend a thousand miles off, and, in the
same space, get an answer. No human invention rivals this in its
vonderful results.

3. From the complaints of Smith to the London company, it
appears that the character of this third set of emigrants was no better
than the former. "I entreat you," says he, "rather send but thirty
carpenters, husbandmen, gardeners, fishermen, blacksmiths, masons,
and diggers-up of tree-roots, well provided, than a thousand of such
as we have."
4. Smith was indefatigable in his endeavors to establish among
the colonists habits of order and industry.  His maxim was, " He
who will not work should not eat."    And he had some success.
Several of the " gentlemern" colonists became wood-cutters.  They
were required to labor six hours a day, for the commoni good; the
rest of the time they had to themselves.
5. At length, Jamrestown began to have the appearance of a regular and comfortable abode. It is true that they had as yet scarcely
fifty acres of soil under cultivation, and were obliged to get their food,
in part, from the Indians and from England; yet they were now improving in their condition. They were also healthier, only seven
having died during the year 1608.
6. Towards the close of this year, a fleet of seven vessels arrived,
with about 300 emigrants. Nine vessels had set out, but two of
them had been wrecked at the West Indies. But Smith could hardly
rejoice at the arrival of" rakes and libertines," and people who were
"packed off," as many of them were, "to escape worse destinies at
home. "
7. Something, however, must be done with them. One plan of his
was to form new colonies. More than one hundred went up to the
falls of the James river, and began a settlement: one hundred more

ttlement at Jamestown in 1607; we have given the progress of
~vents through a long period, in which we have seen the feeble colo-ies striking root in a strange country, and, after contending with hostile tribes of savage men, triumphing at last over the still more fatal
obstacles of poverty, disease and climate.
2. We have seen the thirteen united colonies, with about three
millions of inhabitants, throwing off their allegiance to Great Britain,
and, after a bloody and cruel struggle of eight years, successful in
asserting their independence, and taking their rank among the nations
of the civilized world.
3. We have seen the United States engaged in a-second struggle
with Great Britain, and coming out of the contest with honor. We
have seen the thirteen states increased to twenty-six.  We have seen
orLr territory extended until it stretches from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. We have seen our population increase until it reaches
nearly eighteen millions of inhabitants.
4. We have seen our government tried by factions, rebellion, and
insurrection - by internal commotion and external war - by the strife
of party, the vicissitudes of prosperity and adversity, and we have
seen it come strengthened and established from these threatening
evils.
5. Under the benign influence of liberty, guaranteed to us by our
government, we have seen our country advancing with unparalleled
rapidity in the march of civilization. We have seen the arts spring
up, as if developed by powers of enchantment. We have seen innu
merable inventions, ingenious and useful, brought to light.  We have
seen manufactures, of vast extent and wonderful ingenuity, spread
over our land.
6. We have seen the very elements chained to the car of human
art, and made subservient, in a thousand forms, to the comfort, coInvenience, and luxury of society. We have seen, amid all this, that
religion has acquired additional force over the minds of men - that
the scale of morality is exalted- that the means of education are diffused, and a higher value set upon -its benefits. As members of a
nation thus blessed of Heaven, let us cherish the sentiment of love to
our country, and a feeling of profound gratitude to Heaven for all that
has been done to exalt our native land.

CHAPTER CCI.
Mexico, Guatemala, and Texas.
1. As we have now completed our view of the United States, we
shall proceed to take a hasty view of the other portions of the New
World. Mexico first claims our attention. At the time of the discovery of America, this was the seat of a vast empire called Anahuac.
The people were considerably advanced in civilization. They had
large cities, splendid edifices, vast monuments, numerous arts, and a
regular government.
2. The Spaniards soon became acquainted with the existence of
this country, and an enterprise was accordingly set on foot for its
conquest. This consisted of six hundred soldiers, and was led by a
daring and determined officer, named Hernando Cortez. He landed
on the coast in 1518, and mnarched toward the capital, which bore the
name of Tenuchtitlan, now Mexico.
3. Montezuma was then upon the throne. By a series of measures
displayinig the utmost intrepidity, duplicity, and injustice, Cortez conquered tile entire empire, which became subject to the Spanish crown,
under the title of New Spain.
4. This country continued for more than two centuries to be an
appendage to the Spanish crown. The natives, for the most part,
submitted to the Spanish yoke, and, though their numbers were
thinned by the early wars, and further reduced by the impoverishment
of their country, they still amount to several millions. Most of them

have partially adopted the Spanish customs and the Cathlolic religion.
They are generally occupied in laborious pursuits, and few instances
have occurred in which they have risen above a menial condition in
society.
5. In the year 1808, the people of Mexico rebelled against the government of Spain, and determined to throw off their foreign yoke. In
1813, a national congress declared Mexico to be independent. Spain
made great efforts to subdue the rebellion, but without effect. The
struggle continued with various success until 1821, when the Spanish
army left the country.
6. The independence of Mexico has since been recognized by Spain
and the other leading governments of Christendom. It has been subject, however, to internal convulsions, and can hardly be considered
as yet in a settled state. The government is republican, but several
constitutions have been adopted and repudiated since the year of its
independence. Mexico now contains eight millions of inhabitants,
nearly half of whom are Indians. The present title of the country is
the United States of Mexico.
7. Texas formerly belonged to Mexico, and was one of the states
of that confederacy. The emigration from the United States to this
territory commenced in 1821, and increased so rapidly that, in the
space of a few years, they amounted to several thousands. In 1834,
the federal constitution of Mexico was overthrown by violence, and a
new government established. The people of Texas refused to acknowledge this, and, therefore, adopted a provisional government for
themselves.
8. In the spring of 1836, Santa Anna, the president of the Mexican republic, invaded the province in person, and captured the fortress
of Bexar; but he was afterward defeated and made prisoner by General Houston, in the battle of St. Jacinto. Meanwhile, a convention,
composed of delegates fromin all the districts, assembled, and declared
Texas to be a free, sovereign and independent state, and a constitution
was adopted on the 17th of March.
9. Mexico strenuously endeavored to recover her authority, but
without avail. The government of Texas, which was republican,
became established, and the independence of the country was recognized by Mexico, as well as by the United States. Great Britain, &amp;c.
In 1845, it was annexed to the United States, and war with the United
States followed, as already related. Mexico is now in a distracted
state, arising from the struggles of rival leaders.
10. Guatemala occupies the greater portion of the isthmus that
connects North and South America. At the time of the invasion of
Cortez, it was thickly peopled with Indians called Quiches. These
had considerable cities, and presented nearly the same state of civilizationi as the Mexicans.

that purpose by Cortez, and the country became a Spanish province.
It remained in this condition till the struggle for independence commenced in Mexico, when a similar effort was made by the inhabitants
of this territory, which resulted in their independence. The present
title of the country is the United States of Central America.

British Possessions in Northi Amereica.-  Polar Regions.
1. THE British possessions, superior in extent to the Unitea
States, occupy nearly the whole of North America which lies north
of the river St. Lawrence and the great lakes. The chief divisions
are Nova Scotia, Prince Edward's Island, New Brnnswick, Newfoundland, Upper and Lower Canada, and New Britain, or the Hudson's Bay Company's territories.
2. Nova Scotia was seen by John Cabot, in 1497, and was the
first land discovered on the continent of North America. It was
originally settled by the French, and called Acadie, but. after changing hands several times, it became the permanent possession of Great
Britain. New Brunswick was separated from it, and became a distinct province,, in 1784.

discoveries of Cabot. Early in the 16th century, several French
vessels sailed to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and various attempts at
colonization, in this quarter, were afterwards made. In 1608, the
city of Quebec was founded, and thus the first permanent settlement
in Canada was formed.
4. We have already stated that all the French possessions in this
quarter were confirmed to the British by the' peace of 1763. In 1791,
Canada was divided into Upper and Lower Canada, but they have
recently been again united as one province, though bearing the titles
of Canada East and Canada West.
5. At various periods Canada has been the theatre of important
military events. This was especially the case during the French and
Indian war, the war of the revolution, and the war with Great Britain,
from 1812 to 1815. We have, therefore, already given sufficient
accounts of these proceedings.
6. In 1837, an insurrection broke out in Canada, the object of
which was to throw off the British yoke, and establish the independence of the country. The movement was, however, speedily checked,
and most of the leaders escaped by flight.
7. Hudson's Bay was discovered by Cabot,' in 1512. After many
years the French carried on a considerable fur trade with the countries lying to the westward of this bay. In 1670, the Hudson's Bay
Company was established, and soon rose to prosperity. They have
now several stations, some on Hudson's Bay, others on the coast of
Labrador, and others still far to the north and west. The most
numerous establishments are in the vicinity of James' Bay. The
acquisition of furs is the chief object of these settlers.
8. To the north of the British settlements are a tribe of Indians,
of short stature and squalid appearance, who pass under the general
name of Esquimaux.    They live chiefly by fishing, and in winter
ride over the frozen snows in sledges drawn by dogs. They have no
records, and afford us no history. They resemble the Samoides of
the eastern continent, and are doubtless of the same stock.
9. Still further to the north is Greenland, formerly esteemed a
part of the American continent, but now ascertained to be an island.
It was discovered, in 981, by an Icelander, and was soon after colonized by a number of families from Iceland.  The colony increased
rapidly, but, after a short space, it disappeared from the pages of history, and no trace of the inhabitants has since been found.
10. Greenland was re-discovered by Davis, in 1585, and, in 1721,
a colony was established on the western coast by a Norwegian clergyman, named Hans Egede. This settlement still exists, and is subject to the Danish government.

11. TI'he seas in the vicinity of Greenland have long been resorted
to by ships in search of whales, and here many strange adventures
have taken place in the pursuit of these monsters of the deep.
12. The polar regions have acquired new interest, within the last
twenty years, from the various expeditions of Parry, Ross, and Back,
who were sent out by the British government for the purpose of
exploration. It is through the discoveries of these navigators that
we are assured of the fact that the waters of the Pacific and Atlantic
unite and separate Greenland from the continent.
CHAPTER CCIII.
The West Indies.
1. ST. SALVADOR, the land first discovered by Columbus, and
now called Cat Island, was one of a numerous group called the Bahamas.   These belong to the English government, and have been, in
former times, subject to acts of violence and pillage from pirates, who
infested these regions somewhat more than a century ago. Their
history presents nothing of peculiar interest or importance.
2. Cuba was first discovered by Columbus in 1492. It is the
largest of the West India islands; and, possessing a charming climate,
with a prolific soil, it is one of the finest islands in the world. The
you say of its colonists! 10. What of another colony? 11. What of the Greenland

Indians were conquered, in 1511, by Velasquez, a Spanish general,
and the island was rapidly settled by the Spaniards.
3. Under the cruelties of these new possessors, the aborigines were
speedily exterminated, and Spain has continued in quiet possession of
the island for more than three hundred years, excepting that it was
captured by the British in 1762, being, however, soon relinquished.
4. Hayti, called Hispaniola by Columbus, was discovered by that
voyager soon after he had visited Cuba. The present town of St.
Domingo was founded by him, in 1496, and is, therefore, the oldest
town in this western world. This island was divided between France
and Spain, in 1722, but, in 1789, a revolution broke out, and both
the Spaniards and French were eventually driven out by the negroes.
The latter declared themselves independent in 1801, and have since
maintained themselves as an independent nation.
5. Porto Rico, a beautiful and populous island at the time of its
discovery by Columbus, in 1493, has, since its first subjugation, belonged to Spain. Jamaica was originally settled by the Spaniards, but,
in 1655, it was taken by the English, and has since remained in their
hands. This island, distinguished for its prolific soil and gentle climate,
has been the scene of several terrible earthquakes and hurricanes.
6. To the southeast of Cuba are a group of islands known under
the name of the Caribbees. The principal are Antigua, Barbadoes,
Tobago, and Trinidad, which belong to Great Britain, and Guadaloupe and Martinico, which belong to France. The natives of these
islands, called Caribs, were different from those of Cuba, Porto Rico
and Jamaica. The latter were gentle, soft and effeminate; but the
Caribs were fierce, enterprising and warlike.  To each other they
were mild and affectionate, but they regarded all strangers as foes,
and made war upon them without scruple.
7. They seemed to have made some advances in civilization when
Columbus discovered their islands. They were fond of liberty, and
chose rather to die than submit to the slavery imposed upon them by
their European conquerors. Their numbers gradually diminished, and
nothing remains of this formidable race, except a few scattered remnants.
8. There are several other West India islands, belonging to different European powers, but their history cannot be detailed here. We
can only remark, generally, that the West Indies, lying beneath a tropical sun and abounding in the choicest vegetable productions, have still
been the theatre of frequent scenes of rapine, plunder and bloodshed.
9. In the greedy scramble which followed the discovery of the New
World, they were seized without scruple, and the inhabitants subjugated, enslaved, or butchered, as suited the humor of the invaders.
During the contests of their European possessors, they have been often
taken and retaken, thus sharing in all the calamities of war.

most formidable band of pirates that the world has ever known.
About two centuries ago, a small band of these lawless men inhabited
the island of Tortuga, and lived either by the chase, or by plundering
such vessels as they found upon the adjacent seas.
11. They increased in numbers, and, at length, became the terror
of all the inhabitants in those regions. Their feats of skill, enterprise and daring seemed to be almost miraculous. They even captured the city of Havana, plundered Port au Prince, and, extending
their depredations to the Spanish main, carried off immense sums of
gold, silver, and other valuable commodities.
12. They flourished for more than half a century. The lives of
some of these freebooters present a variety of curious and wonderful
details.  Their career, however, generally terminated in misery, and
the whole band was at last extirpated.
CHAPTER CCIV.
South America.
1. WE have already seen that Columbus discovered the main land
of South America in 1498. Other discoveries, in this quarter, soon
followed. The coast was visited by Vespucius, in 1499, and, the
same year, the shores of Brazil were visited by Pinzon, a Spanish
navigator.
2. In 1513, Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama, and was the
first European whose eyes rested upon the Pacific Ocean, then called
the South Sea. What a mighty discovery! for this was the largest
ocean on the globe, and occupies nearly one fourth part of its surface.
3. It is not easy, at this day, for us to conceive of the state of
excitement in which these European navigators came to America.
They not only looked upon it as a new world, but as one abounding
in wonders. They had found here a strange people, and they had
discovered, amid the tropical regions, a multitude of new and interesting productions.
4. Flowers of the greatest beauty, spices of the rarest fragrance,
valuable gums, rich fruits, birds of magnificent plumage, and all new
to them, crowded upon their attention. Nature, indeed, seemed to
have realized here the enchantments of the fairy tales; yet, thus far,
the avarice of the discoverers was not satisfied. Gold, silver, and

6. There were indeed two exceptions; Cortez had found spoils of
immense value in Mexico, but his success was to be surpassed by
another adventurer. In 1515, Peru had been discovered, and Pizarro,
an illiterate but daring Spanish soldier, soonI after determined upon its
conquest. In 1531, he led thither a small band of soldiers, thirty
horse and one hundred and fifty foot.
7. He found Peru to be an immense empire, united under a race
of sovereigns, called Incas, or Children of the Sun. The people
were pacific, living in large and handsome cities, and subsisting
chiefly by agriculture. They had a mild government, a gentle
religion, and many useful arts. The reigning prince was Atahualpa.
8. Pizarro invited him to a conference, but, when the unsuspecting monarch, with thousands of his attendants, came, the daring and
perfidious Spaniard rushed upon him and dragged him away fromla
the midst of his nobles. At the same time, the artillery and muskets
played upon the masses of the Indians, and cut them to pieces by
thousands. It was one of the most brutal, bloody and dastardly acts
in all the sad tragedies of human warfare.
9. The captive Inca offered to fill the room, in which he was confined, with gold and silver, for his ransom. This was accepted by
Pizarro, and it was affecting to see with what devotion the people, in
all parts of the country, parted with their treasures to release their
captive chief. At length, a mass of gold and silver, to the value of
two millions of dollars, was accumulated, and Atahualpa claimed his
liberty.

Indians, and were either destroyed or driven away.
8. A great misfortune now befel the colony of Jamestown. Captain Smith, being severely wounded by an accident, and almost worn
out with his sufferings and the ingratitude of his employers, departed
for England, leaving the government, for the time, to one Percy
9. Captain Smith was, indeed, a most remarkable man. Few
men are better calculated to be pioneers in settling a wilderness than
he. Few could have seen more clearly in what the true interest of a
rising settlement consisted; and still fewer would have been equally
energetic and disinterested.
10. Feelings -deep and painful- no doubt he had, for who has
them not, in situations so trying as his? - Yet the historian well remarks, "that he was the father of Virginia; the true leader who first
planted the Saxon race within the borders of the United States."
We shall have occasion to mention him again, in the history of New
England. He died in London, in 1631, aged fifty-two years.
- CHAPTER        XVII.
The colony on the verge of ruin.
1. THE departure of Captain Smith for England was like the last
setting of the sun to the colony at Jamestown, at least for a time.
No place ever went more rapidly on towards ruin. Order and industry disappeared, and the Indians not only became less friendly, but

less murderer proceeded to take possession of his empire. Having
conquered the country, and now being gorged with plunder, Pizarro
founded the city of Lima, and became governor of the country.
11. But his ill-gotten wealth and power were vain to the possessor. Hostility and strife sprung up among the band of robbers.
Pizarro was slain by his associates, and the rest of the leaders fell,
one after another, by violence. Let it be remembered that the most
splendid and successful robbery on record was followed by the swiftest
retribution.
12. We may pause here a moment to reflect upon the fate which
attended the three greatest names connected with the early history of
America. Columbus discovered a new world, but he was once carried home in chains, and at last died in poverty and neglect. Cortez
conquered an empire, but the crown did not rest upon his brow.
Pizarro also conquered an empire, and acquired gold beyond the
dreams of avarice, but he, soon after, expired by the assassin's blade.
13. Time, with its solemn jury, has judged the actions of these
three famous men. To Columbus a wreath of immortal fame is
awarded; to the others, the malefactor's infamy. The way of the
transgressor is indeed hard.
14. Peru continued for centuries to be a Spanish province, with
Lima for its capital. To this city, the manners, customs and refinements of Spain were transferred, and thus diffused to several portions
of the province. The country became independent, threw off the yoke
of Spain in 1821, and, after a protracted struggle, it became an independent republic.
CHAPTER CCV.
South America, continued.
1. BOLIVIA, now an independent state, and lying between Peru and
Chili, was originally a part of Peru, and continued so until 1824.
After a battle between the patriot army and the royalists, in which
the latter were defeated, the people declared themselves independent.
This occurred July, 1825. The celebrated Bolivar furnished them a
scheme of a constitution, which was adopted, and the name of the
liberator was given to the republic.
2. Chili was discovered by Almagro, one of the associates of
Pizarro, in 1537. He penetrated into the country with a small force,
and was, at first, well received by the natives; but he was soon forced
to return. In 1540, another army was sent thither, under Valdivia,

who was fiercely opposed, especially by the Araucanians, led by the
renowned Caupolican. In a great battle, Valdivia was defeated, taken
prisoner, and afterwards executed.
3. The country, however, along the coast, was conquered by the
Spaniards, though the Araucanians have ever continued to maintain
their independence. Chili remained as one of the Spanish provinces
till the movement for independence, in 1810, which resulted in the
establishment of a republican government, about the year 1817.
I
4. From Chili, southward, to Cape Horn, the country called Patagonia is for the most part cold, sterile and desolate. There is no
nation with fixed abodes or an established government here. The
country is occupied by various tribes of savages, among whom the
Patagonians, famed for their large size, are the most noted. Along
the gloomy shores of Cape Horn, there is a race, of diminutive size
and squalid aspect, who shiver amid the sleety tempests of these
regions, living chiefly upon the productions of the sea. These bear
the name of Fuegians.
5. The Argentine Republic, bounded on the west by Chili, and on
the east by the Atlantic, Paraguay and Brazil, formnerly bore the title
of Buenos Ayres. This, too, was one of the early possessions of
Spain, and continued subject to that country till 1810, when the people formed a government for themselves. From that period, a constant
succession of convulsions has followed, and, though the country has
been separated from Spain, it must yet be considered in an unsettled
state.
6. Paraguay, one of the finest regions on the face of the globe,
was early occupied by the Spaniards, and became subject to their
of Valdivia. 3. Have the Araucanians ever been conquered? What further of Chili?

sway. The Jesuit missionaries took great pains to introduce civilization and Christianity among the Indians in this quarter, and, it is
believed, with some success. They had schools, and introduced
music among the youth, who became proficients in singing. The
Jesuits, however, were expelled in 1767.
7. When the provinces of Buenos Ayres threw off the Spanish
yoke in 1810, the people of Paraguay refused to acknowledge their
authority, and established a government for themselves. About the
year 1820, Dr. Francia assumed all the powers of government, and
became dictator of the country. He continued to exercise unlimited
sway till the year 1842, when he died. His government was harsh,
but it secured that tranquillity which the independent states of South
America have not enjoyed. The government has since been in the
hands of several persons, who administer it much in the manner of
the dictator. Uruguay, formerly a part of Buenos Ayres, became independent in 1828, and is the smallest of the South American republics.
8. Brazil, occupying nearly one third part of the South American
continent, and a space nearly equal to the surface of Europe, fell to
the lot of Portugal. It was settled about the year 1500, and rapidly
advanced in population. It was ruled by provincial governors till
1806, when the King of Portugal fled thither to escape from the
French, who had invaded his kingdom. He retuLrned, in 1821, leaving his son upon the throne. In 1823, Brazil became an independent
empire.

9. Guiana, lying on the northern coast, is divided between the
Dutch, French and English. Its early history is distinguished by the
expedition of Sir Walter Raleigh, who visited the country in 1595, in
search of El Dorado. This was a kingdom, said to exist in the
interior of South America, which surpassed all other countries in
gold, silver and precious stones. But this tale proved to be a fable,
and the name of the imaginary kingdom is a modern byword significant of idle and extravagant expectations of wealth. The history of
Guiana presents little beside either interesting or instructive.
10. To the north of Peru and Brazil are the three republics of
Equador, New Grenada and Venzuela. This whole country belonged to Spain and constituted several Spanish provinces. They
participated in the desire for independence which pervaded the other
countries in this quarter, and, consequently, threw off the Spaniish
yoke.
11. In the struggles which followed, the celebrated Simon Bolivar
obtained great distinction; the three republics were united under one
government, with the title of Colombia, in 1819, and Bolivar, honored
with the title of Liberator, was entrusted with the supreme authority.
This connection has since been dissolved, the title of Colombia is
erased from the maps, and the three republics that we have named
now exist under three distinct governments.
CHAPTER CCVI.
Conclusion. -Tlze Indian Race.
1. WE have now completed our history of the Western WVorld,
since its discovery by Columbus. This lies within the compass of
three centuries and a half, and presents many topics for profound
reflection. We have already adverted to the fate of the three extraordiniary men who figure in the foreground of the early history of the
continent.
2. We may add here that Spain, the greedy spoiler, who obtained
possession of nearly the whole of South America and the finest portions of North America, has not now an inch of territory upon either.
When she discovered the New World, she was a great, powerfil and
energetic nation, taking a lead in arts and arms. Glutted with conquest and treasure, she became feeble and effeminate, and sunk into a
state of indolence, ignorance and indifference.

and parts of North and South America, the free Indian has given

place to the African slave. There is, however, a rapid tendency tt
the annihilation of the aborigines of America, and the substitution of
the white race in their stead. Many centuries will not pass before
the only remains of the Anmerican Indian will exist in the pages of
history.
4. The question then, as now, will be asked, "Whence came
these people t" It will be easy to tell their fate, for it will be
recorded to the everlasting shame of civilized man; but their origin
must continue to rest in obscurity.
5. The Indians of Mexico and Peru had reached an advanced state
of civilization. Though essentially distinct, they had many things in
common, and many things, also, which bore a strict analogy to the
manners, customs and opinions of the eastern continent.  They
placed a high value upon gold, silver and precious stones; they employed these for ornaments, and wrought them into various forms.
6. Whence this striking analogy with eastern nations, unless by
some means of communication? The Mexicans had computations of
time similar to our own. The Peruvians worshipped the sun, like the
Egyptians and Persians. They both had styles of architecture resembling those of the East. They had sculptures, images and hieroglyphics, reminding every beholder of the antiquities which lie scattered along the Nile.
7. Whence these remarkable resemblances and coincidences?
Man is a being of free and boundless fancy-not a creature of definite
and slavish instincts. The bee will build his cell in hexagons by the
law of his nature, but man has no grooves in his intellect which guide
him into particular trains of thought, and particular forms of fancy.
8. We can, therefore, only account for many things visible among
the Indians of America, by supposing, that, at some period, doubtless
very remote, they had communication with the nations of the eastern
continent. The geography of the country, as well as the credible traditions of the Mexicans, lead us to believe that America was peopled
by emigrants from Asia, by way of Bhering's Straits.

actually began to assume a hostile attitude, and to reniew their outrages.
2. Nor was this all. The indolence and bad conduct of the settlers
brought on a famine in the colony. Their want of food became so
distressing that they devoured the skins of horses, as well as the dead
bodlies of those persons who died or were slain, whether of their own
party, or that of the Indians. To add to the distress, thirty of them
escaped and became pirates.
3. In the short period of six months after Captain Smith's depalture, the number of the colonists was, in one way or another, reduced
from 500 to 60. These, moreover, were so feeble and discouraged
that they were wholly unfit to defend themselves against the Indians;
so that the colony was daily and hourly in actual danger of perishing.
4. In this dreadful condition, little short of despair, they resolved
to return to England. But the decision was scarcely made, when one
of the vessels which had been shipwrecked in the West Indies six
months before, and whose crew and passengers had wintered there,
arrived in the river, and landed at Jamestown.
h5. The wretched, despairing colonists were now urged to remain.
They were now about 200 in numnber. But no pleadings of Sir
Thomas Gates, who was to be their presiding officer till the arrival
of Lord Delaware, could prevail with them. Their plan was to sail
for Newfoundland and scatter themselves among the vessels engaged
in fishing there, and thus find their way back to England.
6. They had four pinnaces remaining in the river, into which they
entered, though almost without provisions, even for the voyage to
Newfoundland. They had resolved - strange to say - on burning
the town when they left it, and the energy of Gates, who, to the last
moment, endeavored to persuade them to remain, was barely sufficient to prevent it.
7. They actually set sail on their voyage. But just as they
reached the mouth of the river - such was the ordination of Providence-Lord Delaware, with provisions and more emio,rants, arrived
from England. This inspired them with a little courage; and, as
there was a favorable wind, the whole company bore up the river,
and slept that night at the fort in Jamestown.
8. Lord Delaware began his wise administration next morning,
with religious exercises, after which he caused his commission to be
read; upon which a consultation was held, and a new government
organized, in accordance with the wishes of the London Company
and their commissioners.
9. Much is said by historians in praise of the wisdom, firmness,
and piety of Lord Delaware. It is recorded that the first business of
each day was to assemble early in the morning in their " little church,
which was kept trimmed with the wild flowers of the country," and

there to invoke the presence and blessing of God, after which they
repaired to their daily labors.
CHAPTER XVIII.
Progress of the colony at Jamestotwn.
1. EVERYTHING now wore a better appearance.     Famine no
longer stared the colonists in the face; their health was improved
considerably; and the Indians were less troublesome than they had
been. Under the administration of Lord Delaware, the people began
to enjoy not only safety, but comfort. Their wretched cabins were
even exchanged for boarded houses.
2. Unifortunately for the colony, Lord Delaware's health failed, and
he returned to England. He was succeeded, however, soon after his
departure, by Sir Thomas Dale. This governor made an important
change in the condition of the colony. Hitherto they had held their
property and labored in common. Governor Dale assigned to each
settler a rot of three acres to cultivate as his own. The quantity was
afterwards increased to fifty acres.
The landing of the first Negroes.
3. In September, 1611, six ships and 300 new emigrants arrived.
Other arrivals there must also have been during the year, for it is the
coincurrent testimony of historians that the population was at this
time about 700. Among other things which arrived, were 112 cows,'0 goats, 200 swinle, and a large stock of provisions. It must be

remembered that none of these domestic animals were natives of
America.
4. A new colony was formed this year, further up the river, and
enclosed with a palisade; it was named Henrico, in honor of the
king's son. Another settlement, five miles from Henrico, was called
New Bermudas. There was peace, now, with the Indians, and this
peace was prolonged by the marriage, in 1613, of Rolfe with Pocahontas- an event which has already been mentioned.
5. Tobacco, which had been discovered by Columbus in his first
voyage, and had now come into use, was first introduced into Virginia in the year 1614. In 1615, the fields, the garden!, and even
the streets and squares, of Jamestown were planted with it, and its
culture was found highly profitable.
6. It does not appear that more than two females came over, till
1611, when 20 arrived. In 1620, when the number of the colonists
was suddenly raised from 600 to 1860 there was a reinforcement of
90 "respectable young women."      They were procured by the
planters as wives, by paying from 100 to 150 pounds of tobacco each,
to defray the expenses of their passage.
7. A number of unfortunate measures were adopted, about this
time. One was the sending over to the colony, as laborers, by order
of king James, 100 criminals; another, the introduction of the silk
manufacture, for which the colony was not yet prepared.  A  still
more serious mistake was the purchase of 20 African slaves from a
Dutch vessel -these being the first introduced into the English settlements.
8. There were frequent and numerous changes in the officers of
the government, especially that of the chief magistrate, near this
period, and some changes, also, in the mode of administration.  Still
the colony was more flourishing, in 1620, than at any former period.
Within three years 50 patents of land were granted, and 3500 new
emigrants received.  There were now, in the commonwealth, 11
parishes and 5 ministers.
CHAPTER XIX.
Settlement of New York.
1. WHILE the colony of Virginia was thus advancing, another set
tlement, to the north, had been established. The island of Manhattan
on which the city of New York was afterwards built, was first discovered, by Captain Henry Hudson, in 1609. This Hudson was the
distinguished navigator who made discoveries to the northward of
Canada and Labrador, and explored the large bay which is called by
his name.

in a northwestern direction. Unable to proceed, on account of tllhe
ice, he returned to Newfoundland, and coasted along the shores of the
United States, discovering Manhattan Island, where New York now  
stands, and at the same time sailing up and giving name to Hudson's
river.
3. As he was in the service of the Dutch when he made his discoveries, the latter claimed the country. The English, however, set
up an earlier claim to it, as being a part of North Virginia. They
also said that as Hudson was a British subject, the countries he discovered were theirs.
4. But the Dutch were determined to hold the territory, if possible.
They, therefore, in 1610, opened a trade withi the natives at Manhattan Island, on the spot where New York now stands, and erected
a fort on or near the present site of Albany. To the country in general they gave the name of New Netherlands; and to the station on
Manhattan Island, when it afterward came to be settled, that of New
Amsterdam.
5. In 1613, Captain Argale, of Virginia, who had sailed to the
north to break up a settlement the French were forming on the Penobscot river, stopped at New York on his return, and demanded the
surrender of the island of Manhattan, and indeed of the whole country,
to the British king.
6. But though the Dutch yielded their claim at this time, it was
simply because they were unable to defend it; for the Dutch traders
continued to occupy it, and a new Dutch governor, in 1614, threw
covery of the Hudson's river, &amp;c.? 3. Whiy were his discoveries for the benefit of the
Dutch? Why did the English claim the country?' 4. What did the Dtitch do? 5.

off the yoke, and put the fort at New Amsterdam in a position of
defence. The desire of the Dutch to hold the place is not surprising
Dutch trading with the Indians.
when we learn that the beaver and other skins procured there, in
1624, were thought to be worth over ten thousand dollars.
7. The Dutch continued to resist the claims of the British to the
country till the year 1664, and, in the mean time, kept up a profitable
trade with the natives. The progress of the settlement was, however,
exceedingly slow, as long as it remained in the hands of the Duttch.
CHAPTER XX.
New England.
1. WE now turn our attention to New England. Nothing had
been known as to the interior of this region till the year 1605. Captain Gosnold had, indeed, explored the coasts, and attempted a settlement on Elizabeth Island, in 1602, but without success. The country
went by the general name of North Virginia - South Virginia extending only so far north as to include the country near Hudson's
river.
2. About the year 1605, Captain Weymouth, an Englishman,
while searching for a northwest passage to the East Indies, discovered the Penobscot river, in Maine, and carried home five of the native
Indians with him, to be educated. These Indians excited great curiosity in England; and their accounts of the country led other navigators to the samre coast.

and make settlements along the coast of North Virginia, as the Lon
don Company were then about to do with regard to the coast of South
Virginia.
4. In 1606 the Plymouth Company sent out two ships of discovery,
under Captains Chalong and Prynne. Captain Chalong took with
him two of the five Indians brought over by Captain Weymouth.
Butt he did not reach America, for his vessel was taken by the Spaniards, and he himself carried as a prisoner to Spain.
5. Captain Prynne, more successful, surveyed the coasts of the
country very extensively, and carried with him to England such a
glowing account of its excellent harbors, rivers, forests and fisheries,
that, in 1607, a hundred adventurers, in two ships, went out to seek
their fortune in America. Eveni in the depths of the green woods,
they expected to find " mines of gold and silver and diamonds."
6. They first fell in with the island of Monhegan, on the coast of
Maine, but landed at the mouth of the Kennebec river, then called the
Sagadahoc. They settled at Parker's Island, and built a fort on it,
which was named Fort George. They brought with them two more
of the five Indians taken away by Captain Weymouth; and this procured them a welcome from all the Indian tribes.
7. The Penobscot Indians were, at this time, the ruling tribe from
Salem to Acadia, or Nova Scotia. Pleased with the new settlers,
their chief acknowledged subjection to the English king, and sent his
son to visit the colony, and opened a trade with them for furs. Happy
had it proved, if the friendly intercourse thus begun on our coast had
been continued.
8. In December, of this year, the ships returned to England; fortypany? 4. What was done in 1606? 5. What of Captain Prynne? 6. Whatt of the

five of the adventurers remained behind. These, however, were soont
discouraged. The winter was excessively severe, and not havirng
brought over a very liberal supply of provisions, they were reduced to
the necessity of living upon fish and very lean game, and finally upon
dogs' flesh. They returned to England with the next vessel, and
gave up the colony.
9. A strange story used to be told of these settlers by one of the
Indian tribes residing on the Kennebec; but it does not comport very
well with other accounts of their pacific disposition. However, as it
is quite possible the deed described may have been done to the Indians
by sormebody, it may be well to relate it. If true, we cannot wonder
at'their subsequent hatred and revenge.
10. The English, it is said, employed the Indians, on one occa
sion, to draw one of their cannons into the fort, by taking hold, unitedly, of a long rope fastened to it. As soon as they were formed in
a straight line, delighted with the sport, the cannon was discharged,
and a great part of the Indians were killed or wounded.
11. In 1614, Captain John Smith, the South Virginia adventurer,
sailed from England, with two ships, on a voyage of discovery, to the
coasts of North Virginia. Arriving at Monhegan Island, in Maine,
he built several boats, such as would better answer his purposes than
larger vessels; and, in one of these boats, with eight men, he traversed the whole coast from Penobscot to Cape Cod, and made many
discoveries.

coast, from Maine to Long Island Sound, most of which he had seen
and observed during his journey.    To many of the capes, points,

islands, &amp;c., of this region, he gave the names they now bear. Tle
map was presented to the king's son, afterwards Charles I., who
named the country, in general, NEW ENGLAND.
13. Captain Smith, on leaving the coast, had left one of his vessels
to procure a cargo of fish for the Spanish market. But Hunt, the
clummander, decoyed on board twenty-seven Indians, which he carried
oway and sold for slaves. This crime, no doubt, afterwards caused
al death of thousands of unoffending men, women and children.
CHAPTER XXI.
The first settlers of New England.
1. THE first permanent settlement in New England was made min
1620, by a company of men, women and children, called Puritans.
They were a pious and excellent people, but somewhat peculiar in
their religious opinions and habits.
2. The Puritans were desirous of a more pure worship of God than
that of the national church of England, and, on this account, had separated themselves from that church, and thus became exposed to a
religious persecution, which, in 1607, drove them, with their pastor,
to Amsterdam, in Holland.
3. This pastor was the Rev. John Robinson. Under his pious care
they remained a year in Amsterdam, when they found it desirable to
remove to Leyden. The flames of persecution continuing to rage in

Lngland, they were joined by many of their countrymen, and the congregation became, in a few years, large and respectable.
4. Yet they never felt themselves at home in Holland. They
were strangers and sojourners there, and likely to remain so. Many
were the reasons - some of them weighty -for refusing to settle
down permanently among the Dutch. They were on the look-out,
therefore, for a resting-place.
5. Just at this time, in the good providence of God, an asylum was
opened to them in the wilds of America. In that untrodden country
they could be free, as they imagined, from persecution and tyranny.
There they could read their Bibles by their own firesides, undisturbed,
and worship God as their own conscience told them was right. They
could also transmit to their children and grandchildren the same privileges.
6. Having procured a vessel, the Speedwell, of sixty tons, they
made preparations to depart for America. Before leaving Holland,
however, they kept a day of fasting and prayer. They then went to
Delfthaven, about twenty miles from Leyden, and thence to Southampton, in England, where they were joined by a company of their Puritan friends from London, in a vessel of one hundred and eighty tons,
called the Mayflower.
7. Their little fleet being in readiness, they set out, August 15th,
for America; not, however, till they had spent a parting hour with
their friends, whose faces they were to see no more, in religious services. A little way out of port, the Speedwell sprung a leak, and

they were obliged to return for repairs. They sailed again, but again
the vessel failed; and it was at length condemned as unseaworthy.

8. One hundred and two of the Puritans now crowded themselves
into one vessel, the Mayflower, and made a final embarkation. This
was September 16, 1620. The weather, as might have been feared
at this season, proved unfavorable, and they were miore than two
months in reaching the shores of Cape Cod.
9. It had been their intention to settle further south, near the Hudson; and with this view, they had procured a patent of the London
Company. But winter was now nigh, Hudson's river far off, and
perilous shoals and breakers between. They therefore gave up their
original plan, and sought a landing-place near where they were.
10. On the 21st of November, sixty-six days after they left Southampton, they found themselves at anchor in Cape Cod harbor, near
the present town of Truro; having lost, during their long and perilous passage, but one man.
11. Before landing, they formed, in the cabin of the Mayflower, a
solemn compact for their future safety and government, which was
signed by forty-one of the number -the rest being women and children -and John Carver was immediately chosen governor of the
colony for one year.

try. The prospect was not very inviting, especially at such a season,
but it was their only resource; and sixteen men were deputed for the
purpose.
2. In their first attempts to go ashore, the water was so shallow
they were obliged to wade a considerable distance, and many of them
took severe colds, which, in some instances, appeared to lay the foundation of what we usually term quick-consumption. They found
nothing, moreover, on shore, but woods and sand-hills. They had
gone out armed, but had not been molested.
3. The next day, November 22, was the Sabbath. On this day
they rested, "according to the commandment" and their uniform custom. On Monday, the men went on shore to refresh themselves and
make further discoveries; the women went also, attended by a guard,
to wash some of the clothing.
4. This same day, they also began to repair their shallop for the
purpose of coasting, the Mayflower being too large and unwieldy for
convenience. It was a slow task, however, for the carpenter did not
complete the necessary repairs till sixteen or seventeen days had
elapsed, and winter was now at hand.
5. On Wednesday, November 25, a party of sixteen men, comn-iatided by Captain Miles Standish, and well armed, went out to rmale
discoveries. When about a mile from the sea they saw five Indians,
who, at sight of their new visitors, immediately fled. The latter pursued them ten miles, but did not overtake them. They had gone so
far, however, that they were obliged to kindle a fire and sleep in the
woods.
6. The next day they found several heaps of sand, one of which

was covered with mats, and an earthen pot lay at one end of it. Oil
digging, they found a box and arrows, upon which they concluded it
was an Indian grave, and accordingly replaced everything as they had
found it.
7. In another place they found a large kettle, and near it another
pile of sand, in which, on a close examination, was found a basket
containing three or four bushels of Indian corn. "This providential
discovery," says Holmes, in his Annals, "gave them seed for a future
hliarvest, and preserved the infant colony fronm famine."
8. One fact should be mentioned, which shows what sort of men
these were. Though they took away the kettle and a part of the
corn, it was with the firm intention to return the kettle if ever they
found an owner, and pay for the corn; and to their honor be it recorded that they actually found the owners afterwards, and liberally
paid them.
9. In the course of the same day, they found more graves, and the
ruins of an Indian hut or house; and in one place a number of palisadoes, or stakes and posts, framed together like a wall. They also
saw a trap for deer, in which one of the party was caught, though
without much injury.
10. After sleeping a second night in the woods, they returned to
their companions, who received them with great joy. It was about
this time that the first white New England child was born. His name
was Peregrine White, and hlie lived to be eighty-four years old.
CHAPTER XXI1.
Landing at Plymouth.
1. IT was the 16th of December, when the shallop was ready.
Four of the principal men, with eight or ten seamen, immediately set
out on a tour of discovery.  Snow had already fallen, and the weather
was so severe that the spray of the sea, falling upon their coats, and
freezing, made them look like coats of mail. They slept the first night
on board the boat; but the next morning the company divided, and a
part travelled by land.
2. As they went on, they found an Indian burying-ground, surrounded by palisadoes, and many graves with stakes around them.
But they saw no living person, nor any place suitable to be the habitation of living men. They met at night with their friends of the shallop; and the whole party slept on shore by a fire.

as they had never before heard. They were struck with surprise, but
recovered in a moment; and now the Indians were as much terrified
by the report of their guns as the emigrants had been by the war
whoop. They thought the explosions were thunder and lightning,
anid fled.
4. The arrows were preserved as curiosities by the English, for
they were the first they had seen. They were pointed with deer's
horn and eagle's claws. Their assailants were of a tribe who remembered Hunt, the kidnapper of their people, and it was no wonder they
sought revenge for the past, or defence against future molestation.
5. The exploring party now went on board the shallop, which pursued its course along the northern shore of the Cape, towards Plymouth. They sought for a convenient harbor, but no harbor was to
be found. At last the pilot, who had some knowledge of lhe coast,
assured them that he knew of a good one far ahead, but which, with
much exertion, might possibly be reached that night.
6. "They follow his guidance. After sailing some hours, a storm
of snow and rain begins. The sea swells; the rudder breaks; and
the shallop must now be steered with oars. The storm increases, and
night is at hand. To reach the harbor before dark, as much sail as
possible is borne- the mast breaks into three pieces - the sail falls
overboard. But the tide is favorable.
7. "The pilot," says Bancroft, "in dismay, would have run the
vessel on shore in a cove full of breakers.'About with her,' exclaimed a sailor,' or we are cast away.' They get her about irnmediately; and, passing over the surf, they enter a fair sound, and shelter
themlselves under the lee of a small rise of land.
8. " It is darkli, and the rain beats furiously; yet the men are so

wet, and cold, and weak, that they slight the danger to be apprehended from the savages, and, after great difficulty, kindle a fire on
shore. Morning, as it dawned, showed the place to be a small island
within the entrance of the harbor."
9. The day which had dawned was Saturday. They not only spent
this in quiet rest, but also the following day. It is wonderful to think
what pious regard these Puritans had for the Sabbath. Though theii
friends on board the Mayflower were waiting in suspense, and everything required the utmost haste, they would not proceed on Sunday if
they could help it.
10. When the Sabbath was over, and they had examined the country, they determined to make it the place of their settlement. They
were particularly pleased with its pleasant brooks and woods, and the
excellent land. The soil of both the main land and two islands adja
cent was covered with walnut, beech, pine and sassafras; and numerous corn-fields were also to be seen. It was December 21, when they
made the landing; and this is the day which should be kept as the
anniversary of the interesting event.
11. They proceeded to convey the intelligence of these things to
their friends on board the ship, which forthwith came to the shore, at
the point fixed upon. On the 30th of December, after landing and
viewing the place again, they concluded to settle upon the main land
in the high ground, amid the corn-fields.
CHAPTER XXIV.
Settlement of Plymouth. -Two mnen get lost in the woods.
1. THE next day after the Puritans landed, they began to cut timber for building, and in a few days to erect cottages, or, as we should
say, log-houses. They continued at this work, whenever the weather
would admit, till about the first of Maich. by which time they had
formed quite a village.
2. The colony consisted of nineteen families. Each family, for the
sake of expedition, had built its own cottage; but they all united in
the erection of a store-house, twenty feet square, for general use and
convenience. They called the place Plymouth, after the place of the
same name they had left behind them in their native country.
3. The first Sabbath after they landed was observed with unusual
solemnity. Some kept it on board the Mayflower, and others in their
new houses- which being made, as has already been said, of logs,
very soon afforded them a partial shelter.
4. On the 12th of January, 1621, three weeks after the arrival,
two persons, named Goodman and Brown, walked into the woods to
Saturday, Sunday, and Monday following? 10. Why did they return to settle in the

collect something for stopping the crevices between the logs of their
houses. They lost their way, and were obliged to sleep in the forest,
although it snowed furiously and was very cold.
5. But this was not all. About midnight they heard a strange
howling in the woods around them. At first it appeared to be a good
way off, but it gradually came nearer. They imagined it to proceed
from lions, and were excessively frightened.
6. In their alarm they sought a tree which they could ascend in a
moment, should the danger become imminent. They then continued
to walk round it, but were ready to leap upon it. It would have been
a cold lodging-place in the middle of winter, and in a severe snowstorm; and though it niight have saved them from the wolves, which
caused their fright, they would, probably, have frozen to death.
7. Fortunately, however, they did not perish, though the morning
found them faint with hunger and cold, and Goodman's feet were so
frozen that his fiiends were obliged to cut off his shoes. Their being
compelled to walk round the tree all night, tedious and distressingi as
it had been to them, doubtless saved their lives.

Sufferings of the co/onists.

1. THE: winter of 1620-21, as we have already seen, was severe,
even for a severe climate. The beginning of March - brought a south

most merrily. The green grass also began to appear, hastened by the
vernal sun and warm showers.
2. But the colonists did not all live to see the return of spring and
summer. Their sufferings had been so great, especially after their
arrival on the coast, that, as one historian testifies, about half of them
were wasting away with consumptions and lung fevers. Besides this,
their labor in erecting their cottages was very great.
3. Of the one hundred and one persons who landed, by the first of
April all but forty-six were dead, including among them Mr. Carver,
the governor, his wife, and a son. The living had hardly been able
to bury the dead. Nor had the healthy been able, at all times, to
take care of the sick; for at one period there were only seven persons
who called themselves well, in the whole colony.
4. Happy for them was it, that, in the arrangements of Divine
Providence, spring came on thus early and favorably, and with it, to
those who survived, returning health and vigor. It is worthy of remark, that of those who survived the sorrows and dangers of this
terrible winter, the far greater part lived to an extreme old age.
5. But new distresses were in reserve for them. The provisions,hey had brought out from England, together with what they could
raise and procure afterward, were but just sufficient to sustain them
through the next winter and until a second crop of corn could be had.
Yet, in November, 1621, a ship, with thirty-five emigrants, arrived,
wholly out of provisions, and dependent on the colonists.
6. This reduced them to half allowance for six months, and a part
of the time to still greater extremities; for it is said that for two months
they went without bread.  "I have seen men stagger," says Winslow, who was one of their number, "by reason of faintness for want
of food."  Sometimes they depended on fish; at others they bought
provisions, at enormous prices, of ships that came upon the coast.
7. Nor did their sufferings very soon end. As late as 1623, their
provisionrs were at times so nearly exhausted that they knew not at
night what they should eat next morning. It is said that in one instance they had only a pint of corn in the whole settlement, which, on
being divided, gave them but five kernels each. It appears, indeed,
that for months together they had no corn or grain at all.
8. Milk, as yet, they had not, for neat cattle were not introduced
among them till the fourth year of their settlement. When any of
their old friends, fiom England, arrived to join them, a lobster or a
piece of fish, with a cup of water, was often the best meal which the
richest of them could furnish.
9. Yet, during all these trials -fi-om hunger, fatigue, sickness,
loss of friends and many other sources, their confidence in God never
once forsook them. Their sufferings even bound them together as by
a closer chain, and while they loved one another better than before,
their love of God was increased in the same proportion.

CHAPTER XXVI.
Treaty with the Indians.
1. IN March, 1621, just before Governor Carver's death, an Indian
chief, by the name of Samoset, arrived at the village. He had seen
some of the English fishermen at Penobscot, and learned a little
broken English, and his first words to those he met with, on entering
the town, were, "Welcome, Englishmen!"     This dispelled their
fears, and gave them courage to enter into conversation with him.
2. Samoset was naked, except a leathern belt about his waist, with
a wide fringe. He was tall, straight, and strong; his hair long behind and short before, and he had no beard. He had with him a bow
and arrows -the usual weapons of war used by his countrymen.
3  The settlers received him kindly, entertained him as well as they
were able, and lodged him for the night. In the morning they gave
him a horseman's coat, a knife, a bracelet, and a ring. Upon this he
departed, promising to make them another visit in a few days. He was
a kind of under sachem or chief of the great tribe of the Wampanoags.
4. lHe came to them again, in a few days, according to his promise,
and brought five more Indians with him. They sang and danced
before the settlers, in the most familiar and friendly manner, and
parted in an amicable way.
5. Shortly afterward other Tndians came to the village, and said
that Massasoit, the great chief of all the tribes in the south easte
part of Massachusetts, was near by.      He soon made his appe.~a:t,.
on the top of a hill, with sixty of his men.   The Englishmen wm       a:

first afraid of such a body of savages; for their whole number, men,
women, and children, did not exceed fifty.
6. Mr. Winslow was sent out to make a treaty with them. He
carried Massasoit two knives, and a copper chain with a jewel in it;
and to his brother, Quadapina, he gave a knife, a jewel for his ear,
some biscuit and butter, and a pot of " strong water," or ardent spirits. Mr. Winslow satisfied the two chiefs, and invited them to the
village.
7. They accepted the invitation, and, with twenty of their men,
came to the town to see Governor Carver. To convince the villagers
that they were friendly, they left their bows and arrows behind them
on the hill. Mr. Winslow, on the other hand, to assure the Indians
that their companions. should not be hlurt by the "thunder and lightning" of the villagers, staid with the party on the hill.
8. A great deal of parade was made by the governor, in receiving
them. His soldiers met them at the foot of'the hill, and, with drums
and trumpets sounding, conducted them to his house, where, after
Governor Carver and Massasoit had kissed each other's hands, they
sat down on a green rug which was spread for them.
9. The Indians, like all ignorant or savage people, were greatly
delighted with these attentions. Food was set before them, and
"strong water" was given to the king; of which, it is said, he drank
so freely that it made him "sweat all the while." A treaty was made,
which was kept faithfully fifty years.
10. It was this same Massasoit that taught the English to cultivate
maize or Indian corn; the first of which was planted in the May
following. Through his influence, moreover, nine smaller chiefs, who
had before been suspicious of the English -partly, no doubt, because
they had stolen their countrymen - subscribed, as he had dorne, a
treaty of peace.
11. The English had an opportunity, soon after this, of returning
the favors of Massasoit and Samoset. The Narragansets, a powerful
tribe of Rhode Island Indians, made war upon Massasoit. After there
had been a good deal of hard fighting, the English interfered in behalf
of Massasoit, and the Narragansets were glad to make peace.
12. It was not long after this time that the first duel was fought
in New England. It was between two servants, with sword and
dagger. They were tried for their crime by the whole colony, and
sentenced to be tied together, neck and heels, for twenty-four hours,
without food or drink. A part of the punishment, however, was, in
the end, remitted.

CHAPTER XXVII.
Drought in the Colony.
1. GOVERNOR CARVER had died about the end of March, 1621,
and Mr. Bradford, afterward the historian of the province, had sticceeded-him. Governor Bradford was much loved and revered for his
public spirit, wisdom, and piety, and was continued in his office nearly
the whole time till his death, about forty years in all.
2. The corn this year proved to be abundant and excellent. The
summer grain was not so good. But the settlers found plenty of
ducks and other wild fowl, as well as fish, and these were of great
service to them in the way of food. Still, they sometimes suffered
from scarcity.
3. About this time, Canonicus, sachem of the Narragansets, forgetting or disregarding the treaty he had made, sent to the Plymouth
people a bundle of arrows tied up with a serpent's skin, which was
the sign of war. Governor Bradford returned the skin, wrapped
round some powder and ball. The Indians were so frightened that
they dared not touch it. They sent it back again, and gave up the
meditated hostilities.

4. The English, however, from the circumstance, took the hint,
and began to fortify their settlement. It had, from the first, been laid
out into streets and lots.   They now    surrounded the whole with a
wall, called a stockade. Their guns were mounted on a kind of

tower, built on the top of the town hill, with a flat roof- the lower
story serving them for a church.
5. As a further preparation to defend themselves, should there be
an invasion, the men and boys of the settlement were divided into
four squadrons, which alternately kept guard night and day. Captain
Miles Standish, an excellent young man, distinguished for his bravery,
was made the commander-in-chief.
6. The harvest of 1622, owing to a drought, was scanty, and the
colonists were obliged to buy food of the Indians. Governor Bradford
travelled among them for this purpose, and Squanto, a friendly Indian,
accompanied him. They procured twenty-eight hogsheads of corn,
for which they paid in knives, blankets, beads, &amp;c. Squanto sickened
and died while on this tour. Whlen dying, he asked Governor Bradford to pray that he "might go to the Englishman's heaven."
7. But Squanto, anxious as he was to "die the death of the righteous," was, in life, more artful and cunning than honest. Still, it
is not to be denied that he employed his cunning in favor of the English. The Indians dreaded him as a sort of conjurer; and he took
advantage of their fear to impose upon them, by relating to them great
stories about the military skill arnd powver of the English.
8. Up to the spring of 1623, the Plymouth colonists had labored in
common. But some of them, as it had been at Jamestown, would in
this way be idle. It was at length ordered that every family should
work by itself, and should be furnished with land in proportion to its
numbers. Under this system the idlers soon disappeared. Even the
women and children went to work in the field.
9. The next year land was assigned to the people to be theirs forever. From this time forth there was no instance in the colony of a
general scarcity of food. Indeed, before many summers had passed
away, they had corn to sell to the Indians, in greater abundance than
the latter had ever sold to thernm.
10. In the progress of the year 1624, new emigrants came over,
and brought with them cattle, with a few swine and some poultry,
also clothing and provisions. The colony now contained thirty-two
houses, and one hundred and eighty inhabitants. The fields and gardens began to assume a pleasing and rather a cheerful appearance.
CHAPTER XXVIII.
The Virginia Massacre.
1. WE must now return to Virginia, of which Sir Thomas NV yatt
had, in 1621, become the governor. He pursued the same general
course in regard to the savages which his predecessors had done- a
course by no means fortunate. Still the country was beginning to be

somewhat prosperous. There were already some 80 settlements, including a population of about 3000.
2. After the marriage of Rolfe and Pocahontas, the Indians had
lived at peace with the English for some time. But Powhatan, already a very old man, had survived his daughter but one year, and
Opechancanough, his brother, who mortally hated the English, had,
in 1618, succeeded him. A plan was therefore laid, in 1622, to destroy them.
Indians plotting the massacre.
3. This plan required a good deal of contrivance on the part of the
indians, for the settlers were scattered along both sides of the James
river, for nearly 150 miles, and the lndians were also much scattered.
It is thought that, in the more thickly settled parts of the country, the
Indian population did not average more than one to a square mile.
4. But Opechancanough took time enough for his plot, and persevered till he had brought all his people to unite with him in executing
it. And though years may have elapsed from the time the plot began, the most entire secrecy was maintained among them to the very
night before they struck the blow.
5. Indeed, on the very morning of the day appointed for the execution of the bloody deed, some of the Indians were " in the houses and
at the tables of those whose death they were plotting." " Sooner,"
said they, " shall the sky fall than peace be violated on our part."
But their deceit in war was not so well understood two hundred year,
ago as now.
6. The night before the massacre took place, however, the plot
was revealed by a converted Indian to a part of the English, so that

the people of Jamestown and a few of the adjacent settlements were
on their guard, and a large part of them was thereby saved.
7. The attack was made precisely at noon, April 1st, and was
made upon all, without regard to age, character or sex. The feeble
and sickly no less than the healthy; the child at the breast as well as
its mother; the devoted missionary as well as the fraudulent dealer in
trinkets and furs-were alike victims.
8. It is not a little singular that the savages should have selected
such an hour of the day, in preference to the darkness of the night,
for their work of butchery, and still that the blow should have been
struck so suddenly. Yet thus it was so unexpectedly was the tomahawk turned against them, that many, it is said, never knew what
killed them.
9. Thus, in one short but awful hour, 347 persons, in a population
of 3000 or 4000, were butchered, and a group of eighty settlements reduced to eight. The rest were so frightened that they dared not pursue
their usual avocations. Even the public works, in most places, were
abandoned. And to add to the general distress, famine and sickness
followed the massacre, as well as a general war with the Indians.
10. The savages, however, were but poorly provided with firearms, and a dozen, or even half a dozen white men, well armed, were
able to cope with a hundred of them. When Smith was captured, he
was defending himself, single-handed, till he stuck fast in the mire,
against from one to two hundred Indians.
11. Peace, it is true, was finally made; but it was only a peace
of compulsion, so far as the Indians were concerned. They gave tup
open war, because the colonists came over too fast, and were too
strong for them. But they still meditated revenge, as is obvious from
the fact that only twenty-two years elapsed before they attempted
another outrage.
12. The 28th of April, 1644, was the time appointed for this
second massacre, in which not only the settlers were aimed at, but
their cattle and other property. The attack was sudden and unexpected, like the former. Providentially the savages took fright, from
some unknown cause, and fled in the midst of their cruelties, not however till they had slain 300 persons and destroyed much property.
13. This second massacre, as well as the first, was succeeded by
sickness and suffering, and both of them by emigration to New England and the return of some to the mother country.  Not long after
the second massacre, the aged chief, Opechancanough, died of a
wound inflicted by a soldier, after he had fairly and honorably given
himself up as a prisoner.

CHAPTER XXIX.
Settlements on Massachusetts Bay.
1. WE must again return to the history of New England. A settlement was begun at Weymouth, Massachusetts, in 1622, hby Thomas
Weston, a merchant of London, and fifty or sixty more. The next
year a plot was laid by the Indians to destroy it, which would no doubt
have succeeded, had not Massasoit, the friendly chief, who supposed
himself to be about to die, revealed it.
2. As soon as the plot was known, it was decided to break it up,
if possible, lest the conspirators, if successful, should carry their work
of butchery into the rest of the settlements. Captain Standish, with
eight men, was therefore sent out to destroy the leaders in the conspiracy, and put the rest in fear.
3. This was a most singular expedition, and one which to us, at
the present day, seems almost incredible. What could nine men do
in the way of chastising a whole tribe of Indians. Yet Captain Standish and his men ventured boldly among them, slew the conspirators,
and several others who opposed them, and drove the rest into the
swamps, where many, it is said, perished from disease.
4. A settlement was beogun at Braintree, in 1625, on a hill not far
from the seat of the late President Adams, and was called, in honor
of Mr. Wollaston, the principal settler, Mount Wollaston. But the
colonists consisted of fifty servants, and it did not thrive. The following year a part of them were transported to Virginia. A settlement
was begun, in 1624, at or near Gloucester, on Cape Ann.
5. The same individuals who settled Gloucester proceeded soon
after to settle Salem, Charlestown, Dorchester, Watertown, Roxbury
and Boston. Among the number were several ministers of the gospel,
and a Mr. John Endicot, afterwards Governor Endicot.
6. Salem, called by the Indians Naumkeag, was begun in 1628,
by Mr. Endicot and about one hnndred emigrants. They were reinforced the next year by three hundred or four hundred other emigrants,
who brought with them one hundred and forty head of cattle, and a
few horses, sheep and goats. Two hundred of the Salem settlers
proceeded, soon afterward, to Charlestown, and others to Dorchester
and elsewhere.
7. These various settlements were incorporated, in 1629, under the
nanie of "The Colony of Massachusetts Bay," and extended as far
north as the present boundary of New Hampshire. A formt of government was projected by their friends in England, and Mathew Cradock appointed governor; but he was succeeded, soon after, by John
Endicot.

corded and remembered. One Morton, a man greedy of gain, who
came over to Weymouth with Captain Wollaston, sold guns, powder
and shot to the Indians, and taught them how to use them. He was
rebuked by Governor Endicot and others, but to no purpose. At last
he was seized and sent to England, but not till he had done a work
of mischief for which a long life could not atone.
CHAPTER XXX.
NVew Hampshire.
First settlement in New Hampshire.
1. THE first permanent settlement in New Hampshire was made
in the year 1623, on the Piscataqua river, not far from the place
where Portsmouth now stands. The first house built was called
Mason Hall, in honor of John Mason, who, with Ferdinando Gorges,
set on foot the enterprise, and afterward procured a patent of the territory. It was soon after granted to Mason alone, and then first
received the name of New Hampshire.
2. The place where they established themselves was called Little
Harbor. It has often been mistaken for Portsmouth; but this town
was not settled till eight years afterward, and was two miles further
up the river, at a place called Strawberry Bank. Some parts of the
wall and chimney of Mason Hall were starding till about half a century ago.
3. Other places in New Hampshire were settled the same year,
including Cocheco, afterward called Dover. But the progress of

the colony was slow. It was not separated from Massachusetts till
1680, and, as late as 1742, only contained six thousand persons liable
to taxation. It suffered much from the Indian wars.
4. The first legislative assembly was convened in New Hampshire
in 1680; and John Mason was the first governor. A constitution
was formed for the state in 1783, and went into operation the next
year. This year is remarkable for an earthquake, which shook even
the granite mountains of New Hampshire itself. It was felt as far
south as Pennsylvania.
5. There was an insurrection here in 1786, excited and led or by
the insurrection in Massachusetts of the same period. On the tw-antieth of September, a body of two hundred men surrounded the courthouse at Exeter, in which the general assembly were sitting, aad
held them prisoners for several hours. Other acts of violence were
also committed. There was, for a time, every appearance of a
civil war. The insurrection was only quieted by calling out the
militia.
6. New Hampshire has been in general a peaceable and quiet
state; it is distinguished for its excellent pastures, and towering
hills, and fine cattle. The White Mountains lift their lofty peaks in
this state, and they may be seen at sea at a vast distance. They are
the highest mountains in New England.
CHAPTER XXXI.
Government of the colonies.
1. THE agreement of the settlers at Plymouth, just before they
landed, has been nmentioned, as well as the names of some of theii
early governors. For four years, the governor of the colony had no
other counsellors or assistance in his office than what was afforded
by one individual. In 1624, the nuimber of assistants was increased
to five.
2. The lands had at first belonged to the Plymouth Company, but,
in 1627, the colony purchased them for eighteen hundred pounds,
and received a patent for the same, with ample powers of government.
Seven assistants with the governor constituted the government. This
system was continued till 1639, when deputies or representatives of
the people began, for the first time, to have a voice in the government.

high privilege of worshipping God according to the dictates of their
own consciences. The settlers of both colonies were, for the most
part, Puritans.
4. At first the affairs of government for the colony of Massachusetts Bay had been, to all intents and purposes, transacted in London. But in August, 1629, the Company very wisely concllded to
transfer the government from London to Massachusetts; and for this
purpose proceeded to the choice of a new board of officers.
/
Board of London.
5. In virtue of this arrangement John Winthrop was chosen
gov ernor, and Thomas Dudley deputy governor. They came over
in Tune, 1630, with a fleet of eleven ships, and more than eigfht
hiL idred emigrants, at an expense of one hundred thousand dollars.
Se ren hundred more emigrants are said to have come over the same
ye Lr.
6. Governor Winthrop and his associates brought with them a
charter for the colony, which, among other things, empowered them
to elect their own officers. They held this charter about sixty years,
or till the union of the colonies of Massachusetts and Plymouth- an
event which took place in the year 1691.
7. Under the charter which has just been mentioned, the legislature of the colony consisted of a governor, deputy governor, and
eighteen assistants, to be elected annually by the freemen, and to constitute, as it were, an upper house or senate; and of the general
body of the freemen themselves. They met four times a year, and
oftener if found necessary.

met at Boston, in October, 1630. Upwards of one hundred persons
were made freemen. At the general court, in May, 1631, the number of freemen had increased to about one hundred and fifty.
9. The population did not increase at this time so rapidly as i'
had a short time before. Only three hundred and forty persons came
over in the space of two whole years. Emigrants were probably
deterred by sickness; for during the single winter of 1629 more than
two hundred of the Massachusetts settlers died. Such was the terror
inspired by sickness and other causes that about one hundred returned
to England.
10. Nor was this all. The dwellings, and perhaps the clothing, of
the settlers were insufficient for the climate. The winter of 1631 was
one of unusual severity, even for New England, and some were actually
frozen to death. Famine followed on sickness. Not a few were
compelled to live on shell-fish, ground-nuts and acorns. The governor himself, at one time, had "his last corn in the oven."
11. A day of fasting and prayer for the colony was appointed
February 6, 1632; but on the 5th, a ship arrived from England, well
laden with provisions. The day of fasting was changed to a day of
thanksgiving -the first of the kind ever kept in the present territory
of the United States.
12. It is worthy of being remembered that the custom of drinking
healths at ordinary meals, which prevailed at this time in England,
and had found its way to America, was early abolished in the colonies; Governor Winthrop setting the example of self-denial at his
own table, and urging it among his people.
13. The first churches in Boston and Charlestown were founded
in the summer of 1630, after a solemn fast. At the close of another
fast, in August of the same year, a minister was installed. For two
or three of the first years of the colony, none but members of the
church were allowed to vote in the general court or assembly.
CHAPTER XXXII.
Settlement of Maryland.
1. TIlE settlement of Maryland had its origin in the exertions of Sir
George Calvert, a Catholic, afterwards called Lord Baltimore. He
had been a secretary of state under King James I., and was made a
lord on account of his services to the crown -one of which services,
it is said, consisted in bringing about a marriage between the king's
son and a Spanish princess.

a tract of country lying on the Chesapeake Bay, belonging to what

was then called South Virginia, he returned to England to procure
a patent of it from the king. Before the patent was made out, he
died, and it was given to his son Cecil.
3. The province was named Maryland, by King Charles I., in the
patent, in honor of his queen, Henrietta Maria, daughter of the king
of France. A part of the province appears to have been included in
the grant made some time afterward to William Penn, and to have
given rise to much contention between the successors of Penn and
Baltimore.
4. In March, 1634, Leonard Calvert, the brother of Cecil, with 200
emnigrants, most of them Roman Catholic gentlemen, with their servants, arrived at the mouth of the Potomac river, and leaving the
vessel, ascended in a pinnace as far as Piscataqua, an Indian village,
nearly opposite Mount Vernon.
5. The sachem of Piscataqua gave Calvert full liberty to settle
there if he chose; bitt, not deeming it on the whole safe, he began a
settlement lower dovn, on a branch of the Potomac, at the Indian
town of Yoacomoco. The settlement was called St. Mary's.
6. To gain the good will of the Indians, Calvert made them presents of clothes, axes, hoes, and knives. Their friendship was easily
secured; and their women, in return for the kindnesses of the English,
taught them how to make corn bread. This, perhaps, was the first
knowledge which the settlers had of" hoe-cake," or johnny-cake.
7. The colony of Maryland met with few of the troubles which
had been experienced by its sister colonies. They arrived in season
to cultivate the soil for that year, and the seasons for several of the
succeeding years were all favorable.  They had the Virginians,
moreover, for near neighbors, who furnished them with cattle and

mnany other necessaries, as well as, in effect, protected them from the
Indians. In addition to all which, they enjoyed good health.
8. In February, 1635, in less than one year from the date of the
settlement, the freemen of the colony assembled to make the necessary
laws. The charter which had been granted them was exceedingly
liberal. They were allowed the full power of legislation, without the
reserved privilege, on the part of the crown, to revoke or alter their
acts. The government underwent some changes in 1639; and, in
1650, they had an upper and lower house in the legislature, like their
nei,ghbors.
9. Ten or twelve years of peace having passed away, a rebellion
broke out in Maryland, headed by one Clayborne. Having formed a
little colony before the arrival of Calvert, he refused to submit to his
authority. Convicted, at length, of murder and other crimes, he fled
from the province, but returned with a large mob and broke up the
government. Order, however, was in a little time restored, and
things again went on prosperously.
CHAPTER XXXIII.
Settlement of Connecticut.
People going to settle in Connectiezt.
1. WE now come to the settlement of Connecticut. As early as
1621, an Indian sachem came from the valley of the Connecticut
river to Boston and Plymouth, and urged the two governors to make
settlements there. The soil, he said, was exceeding rich; in addition
have advantage over the other colonists? 8, What of the governmnent of the colony?

to which he offered them a yearly supply of corn, and eighty beaver
skins. He was treated with great kindness, but no steps were imrnediately taken to form a settlement.
2. Sometime afterward, Governor Winslow, of Plymouth, made a
tour to the valley of the Connecticut, and came back so well pleased
with the country that preparations were soon made for establishing
a trading-house there. But the Dutch of Manhattanl, having heard
of the plan, immediately proceeded to erect a fort there. This was
in 1633.
3. The movements of the Dutch did not at all intimidate the Plymouth people. Having got ready the frame of a house, they sailed for
the Connecticut river. When they came opposite the Dutch fortthe spot where Hartford now stands-the Dutch forbade their proceeding any further, on penalty of being fired upon. They did not
regard this, however, but proceeded up the river.
4. They landed on the west side of the stream, where Farmingtoi
river empties in, and laid the foundation of Windsor. The Dutch,
with a band of 70 men, attempted to drive them away in 1634, but
did not succeed. Thus was a foot-hold gained in Connecticut.
5. Wethersfield and Hartford were settled in 1635, by a company of
emigrants from Newton and Watertown, near Boston. It consisted
of men, women and children, to the number of 60, with their cattle
and horses. They left home on the 25th of October, and were a
fortnight on the road, wading through rivers and swamps, and traversing hills and mountains.
6. But they had begun the journey too late in the season. The
winter came upon them in their new residence, before they were prepared for it, and the snow fell very deep. They had sent their goods
and provisions by water, but the vessel did not arrive, and was supposed to be cast away. Thus a famine was at once produced among
them.
7. In this dreadful condition, they became quite discouraged, and
some of them desperate. Fourteen of the number set out to return
to Boston by the way they came. One was drowned in crossing the
river, and the rest would have perished on the road, had they not
been relieved by the Indians. A great many emigrants returned by
water.
8. It is difficult to say which suffered most, those who went away
or those who remained. They received a little of the promised aid
from the Indians, but their fare was at times scanty - consisting
chiefly of acorns and grain. A part of their cattle subsisted by
browsing on what they could find in the woods and meadows.
9. The Plymouth Company in England had, in 1631, given to
Lords Say and Seal, and Lord Brook, a patent of the lands lying about
the mouth of the Connecticut river. In 1635, a son of Governor
Winthrop, of Massachusetts, with 20 men, built a fort there, which

he called Saybrook, and became the governor of it. The D)utch tried
to drive him away, but without effect.
10. In June, 1636, 100 emigrants from Dorchester and Watertown, accompanied by two ministers of the gospel, Mr. Hooker and
Mr. Stone, crossed the mountains, swamps, and rivers, to Connecticutt.
They journeyed on foot, and drove 160 head of cattle; subsisting
chiefly during the journey on milk. They were a fortnight on the
road. They settled at Hartford, which they called Newtown.
11. As they passed along, the woods resounded with their songs
and hymns and prayers, and with the lowing of their kine. They
had no guide but a cornpass, and Him who guarded the host of Israel
in their travels from Egypt to Canaan. They had no pillows but
heaps of stones. None saw them but here and there a group of wan
dering savages, and the Eye which sees arnd observes all secrets.
CHAPTER XXXIV.
Rhode Island and Roger TWilliams.
Roger Williams banished.
1. IN February, 1621, a Puritan minister arrived in New England,
by the name of Roger Williams. He was as yet scarcely thirty years
of age.  He was a man of some enlightened views, but his temper was
not properly disciplined. He was, however, an ardent friend of religious liberty, and a foe to every form of legal intolerance.
2. He was, at first, pastor of a church in Salem.    Here, having

dentominations of Christians, rather more boldly than was acceptable
to the Massachusetts government, and having also announced some
strange opinions, with an overbearing spirit, he was tried for heresy,
arid was sentenced to leave the province.
3. He first repaired to Seekonk, now in Rhode Island; but having
learned, soon after, that the place was within the jurisdiction of the
Plymouth colony, he removed, June, 1636, to the place where Providence now stands, and laid the foundation of a colony, of which he
was, at one and the same time, minister, instructor and father.
4. But the labors of Roger Williams were not by any means confined to his own countrymnen. Though his manners had been harsh,
hlie had a good heart. Like Eliot, he did much for the conversion and
improvement of the savages. He even took pains, like him, to learn
their language, that he might the better conciliate, instruct, improve
and elevate them; and at the same time, preserve his colony from
destructive and bloody wars.
5. Providence was within the territory of the Narraganset Indians,
but Mr. Williams very soon obtained a deed of it; not for himself or
his friends, for though it was his own property as much as the clothes
he wore, yet he gave away every foot of it. Nor did he love power
more than property, for, instead of making himself the magistrate, the
colonists had none till the year 1640.
6. The Providence settlement soon became the asylum of all who
were persecuted in the other colonies on account of their religious
opinions, especially the Baptists, to which sect Mr. Williams adhered.
In 1639 a Baptist church was formed there; the first in the United
States. Twelve years later, the General Court of Massachusetts, by
their severe laws, drove a greater number to Rhode Island than ever
before.
7. Rhode Island, properly so called-that is, the beautiful island
which goes by this name, was first settled in the spring of 1638, by
William Coddington and seventeen others. In the following November, Mr. Coddinlgton was chosen governor. These last were the followers of one Anne Hutchinson, a fanatic in religion, but in many
respects a wise and virtuous woman.
8. Until 1640, the citizens of Providence had made their own rules
and laws in a general convention. They now thought it best to adopt
a more permanent form of government, and, in 1644, Roger Williams,
with the aid of Governor Vane, of Massachusetts, procured a charter
for the two settlements, under the name of the Rhode Island and
Providence plantations.

6768              WAR WITH THE PEQUOD INDIAN.
CHAPTER XXXV.
War with the Pequod Indians.
1. CONNECTICUT was first organized as a government separate from
Massachusetts and Plymouth, in 1636. Its inhabitants held their first
general court or assembly at Hartford, in the sprinlg of that year.
The first law they passed was that arms and ammunition should not
be sold to the Indians.
2. Enough, however, had been done, long before, by unprincipled
men, like Hunt and Morton, to excite that savage jealousy, which,
when once roused, makes little discrimination, but vents itself with
nearly equal readiness on all who are white, without regard to age or
sex. The period was at hand when the colonists of Connecticut were
to feel the full force of savage vengeance.
3. The Pequods, or Pequots, were a very formidable tribe, having
at least 700 warriors. Their principal settlement was on a hill in
Groton, near New London, in Connecticut, though they had forts elsewhere. They were the terror of many other tribes of Indians, and
they soon became a serious annoyance to the Connecticut and Massachusetts settlers.
Burning of the fort.
4. They had, in the first place, murdered some of the traders fromrn
Massachusetts, especially one Oldham, at Block Island, and Governox
Endicot had been sent to treat with them, or bring them to submis

5. In March, 1637, they became so bold as to attack the fort at
Saybrook, and kill three of the soldiers. In April, they murdered
several men and women at Wethersfield, carried away two girls into
captivity, and destroyed twenty cows.  The inhabitants could no
longer consider themselves safe, by night or by day, in their houses or
in their fields.
6. The General Assembly, whichl convened at Hartford, May 11,
resolved to make war upon them; and ninety men -about half the
colony who were able to bear arms- -with Captain Mason at their
head, accompanied by seventy friendly Mohegan Indians, and Rev. Mr.
Stone as their chaplain, were sent out to attack the Pequods in their
own country.
7. Sailing down the river, and thence to Narraganset Bay, they
were joined at the latter place by 200 Narraganset Indians, and, after
landing and proceeding toward the Pequod country, by 500 Nianticks.
The Pequods had two forts, one at Mystic, in the present town of
Groton, and another further on. They resolved to attack the former.
8. They arrived at Mystic river, near the fort, late in the eveninrg,
and pitched their camp by two large rocks, now called Porter's rocks.
About day-break the next morning, they were ready to advance and
attack the fort. The first signal of their arrival was the barking of
a dog, upon which an Indian in the fort cried out, " Owanux! Owanux!" which meant Englishmen! Englishmen!
9. The battle soon began, and for a long time was severe. The
fate of Connecticut, and perhaps of all New England, was to be determined by seventy-seven men.@  Every soldier, therefore, fought
for his own life and the lives of his countrymen. With the Indians,
too, everything was at stake; and their arrows descended among the
English like a shower of hail.
10. At last, seeing his men begin to tire, Captain Mason cried out,
"We must burn them!" -and, seizing a fire-brand firom one of the
wigwams, he applied it to the combustible material of which it was
composed, and in a few minutes the whole fort was in flames. The
fire and sword together made terrible havoc; and soon victory decided
in favor of tlhe colonists.
11. But the contest was not yet over. Three hundred Pequods
from the other fort came now to the assistance of their brethren, but
these too were gallantly repulsed, and the colonists retired leisurely
to go on board their vessels at the Pequod harbor. When the battle
ended, their vessels were not yet in sight, but, as if guided by a Di
vine Hand, they came in sight soon afterward.
12. The colonists had but two men killed and sixteen wounded ir
the contest; while the Indians lost seventy wigwams, and, as it was
thought, from 500 to 600 men. But the blow was decisive. The

Indians looked at the smoking ruins, stamped on the ground, tore
their hair, and rushed on the colonists; but to no purpose.
13. The battle was scarcely ended, when a body of 200 troops
from Massachusetts and Plymouth arrived. They renewed the war,
burniing wigwams, destroying cornfields, and killing men, women, and
children. The survivors were driven to a swamp, where they finally
surrendered, except Sassacus, their chief, and a few of his men, who
fled to the Mohawks, by whom Sassacus was afterwards murdered.
CHAPTER XXXVI.
Anecdotes of the Pequod War.
1. ONE of the early laws of New England was,-" Some minister
is to be sent forth to go along with the army, for their instruction and
encouragement." Moreover, they sometimes began their wars by a
season of fasting and prayer. We may smile at this strange attempt
to intermingle religion and bloodshed; but it exhibits the Puritan
character.
2. The whole night before Captain Mason set out from Hartford to
attack the Pequods, was spent by Mr. Stone, at the request of the soldiers, in earnest prayer. Again; having arrived at Narraganset Bay
on Saturday, instead of proceeding on their journey the next day, they
kept it as the Sabbath, with the most scrupulous exactness.
3. War is horrible at best, but it is always delightful to find its
horrors in any degree mitigated.  While the soldiers of Captain
Mason were slaughtering the Indians at Fort Mystic by hundreds, and
actually piling the dead bodies in heaps, they spared the women.
Many of the Indian warriors, observing this, cried out, "I squaw! I
squaw!" But it did not save them.
4. The friendly Indians, under Uncas, sachem of the Mohegans,
and Miantonomoh, sachem of the Narragansets, were terribly afraid
of the Pequods, and especially of Sassacus, their chief. When Captain Mason inquired of Miantonomoh, why the Narragansets did not
come forward and help him, he replied, "Sassacus is in the fort.
Sassacus is all one God; nobody can kill him."
5. The two hundred Pequods- men, women, and children - who
surrendered to the colonists, were either enslaved by the English or
incorporated with the Mohegans or the Narragansets. There did not
remain "a sannup or a squaw, a warrior or a child, of the Pequod
name. A nation had disappeared in a day!"
6. Still, this war would have been more dreadful than it was, but
for the benevolent and pious labors of Roger Williams. When the
Pequods found they had provoked the colonists to make war upon

them, they tried to enlist on their side the Mohegans and Narragansets. They hoped that by their united exertions they might be able
entirely to sweep the colonists from the hunting ground of their
fathers.
7. There was no white man in New England that dared, at this
critical time, to expose himself to Indian fury, but Roger Williams.
Aware of the danger to the colonists, this good man, amid storm and
wind, and at the most imminent hazard of his life, embarked in a
canoe, and hastened to the wigwam of the Narraganset sachem, even
while the Pequod ambassadors were there, still reeking with the blood
of Oldham and others.
8. Here, for three days and nights, he ate and drank and slept in
their midst, in danger of being shot, or having his throat cut, every
moment. The Narragansets for some timne wavered, but he, at length
succeeded in preventing them from entering into a league with the
Pequods, and thus, probably, saved the colonies from extinction.
CHAPTER XXXVII.
Settlement of Newz Haven.
1. THE Indian name of New Haven was Quinnipiaclk. The people
of the Connecticut colony had become acquainted with it during the
war with the Pequods. About this time Rev. Mr. Davenport, and
two merchants of London, by the name of Eaton and Hopkins, and a

company of emigrants, came over to America; and Mr. Eaton and a
few others went to Quinnipiack and built a hut, and remained there
during the winter.
2. In the spring of 1638, Mr. Davenport and his whole company
went there to reside permanently. At two different purchases, they
bought of the Indians nearly the whole of what now constitutes the
county of New Haven.   For the first and smallest portion, they gave
a dozen, each, of coats, hoes, hatchets, spoons and porringers, two
dozen knives, and four cases of Frenrch knives and scissors; and, for
the largest, thirteen coats, only.
3. Some may think the Indians were defrauded by these purchases;
or, at least, would be likely to think themselves so afterward. But
such persons forget that these articles were worth more then than they
now are; and, besides that, the land was really worth nothing to the
Indians, nor much to anybody else. Besides, the Indians retained the
right to hunt on the land, and, if they pleased, to plant a certain portion.
4. On the first Sabbath, which the colonists kept regularly at New
Haven, April 28, Mr. Davenport preached to the people under a large
spreading oak. Mr. Davenport was a most excellent man, and with
his coadjutors gave a tone to the character of New Haven that has
never been wholly lost. The laying of the city into squares, and the
beautiful green, or common, are memorials of their efforts.
5. The three towns, Windsor, Hartford and Wethersfield, early
in the year 1639, formed themselves into a distinct government, and
adopted a constitution, and John Haynes was elected their first governor. Their constitution has been much admired. It lasted, with
little alteration, till 1818, or about one hundred and eighty years; and
was in substance as follows.
6. The general court, or legislative assembly, was to be held twice
a year, viz., in spring and autumn; but the officers of the government
- the governor, deputy governor, and five or six assistants - with
the representatives from the several towns, were to be elected on the
first Monday of April annually. The settlement at Saybrook soon
became united with that at Hartford.
7. Until the year 1665, New Haven was a colony by itself, separate from Hartford, under the name of the Colony of New Haven.
A constitution was formed and adopted by the colony essentially like
that of Connecticut, in the autumn of the same year, 1639; and TI'heophilus Eaton was chosen the first governor, and reelected every year
till his death, which happened about twenty years afterward.
8. The first inhabitants of New Haven, almost without exception,
were men of learning and piety. They paid great attention both to
education and religion. At first they had all their property in common, as at Jamestown and Plymouth. Not a few of their first governors, moreover, as well as several other officers, refutised to receive
any salary or special compensation for their public services.

time to time, to molest the Connecticut colony, but no serious or at
least bloody engagement ever took place between them. Their greatest trouble was with the Indians. With this exception, and a continual series of disasters at sea, their first years were quite prosperous.
10. The first great earthquake in New England, after its settlement, took place in June, 1638. The earth shook with such violence
that in some places people could not stand without difficulty, and the
furniture in the houses was thrown down. Similar shocks were felt
in 1663, 1727, 1761, and 1783.

1. THE conduct of the Puritans in New England did not fail to
keep up the spirit of persecution   in those whose high-handed
measures had driven them there. The forms of the English church
discipline were seen to be disregarded, and marriage to be celebrated
even by the civil magistrate. And in spite of all this, good and loyal
subjects of the king were continually emigrating.
2. What could be done     In the first place, ships freighted with
passengers and bound for New England were forbidden to sail. in
the next place, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and others, obtained
power to legislate for the colonies; to revoke their charters if thought
necessary; to regulate and govern their church, and to inflict punishmenit for refriactory conduct.

hundred pounds sterling among them, and applied it immediately to
the erection of fortifications.  But this only so much the more
offended their enemies in England, and increased their disposition to
stand in'the way of their liberties.
5. Whole squadrons, ready to sail for America with passengers,
were stopped. It is even said that Cromwell and Hampden, who
afterwards became so conspicuous in the measures which led to the
death of the king, were on board of one of the vessels, and would
have sailed for America had not the king himself prevented it. Little
did he know what he was doing.
6. It was impossible, however, to check the tide of emigration,
except for a short time. Persecution, for religious opinions, had
awakened a spirit of emigration in Europe, which had not been known
before. One hundred and ninety-eight ships had already crossed the
Atlantic to New England, carrying with them twenty thousand passengers; and the plantations there had cost nearly a million of dollars.
7. It was just at this period of the colonial history, when they were
in danger, not only from foes at home but from enemies of their libe-ty abroad, that a union of the colonies, for mutual preservation and
defence, began to be discussed. Nor did their victory over the Pequods, nor the temporary suspension of Dutch hostilities, lull them
into security. The measure was not only talked of, but, at last, executed.
8. The articles of confederation were signed May 29, 1643. The
union which was formed took the name of "The United Colonies of
New England."    It embraced Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut
and New Haven, and should have included Rhode Island and Providence plantations. This colony petitioned for admittance, but was
refused, because it would not be merged in the colony of Plymouth.
9. This union lasted forty years or more, and was of great service
while it lasted. If it did not prevent that foreign interference which
was threatened, it defended the coloniies, at least, from the Indians and
Dutch, and other enemies at home, both by leading them to feel more
strongly tihe ties of sympathy and brotherhood, and by enabling them
to mnake treaties on a more certain and permanent basis.

CHAPTER XXXIX.
The Indians of New England.
1. OuR New England ancestors had so much to do with the Indians, whom they found here at the time of their arrival, that a history of the country will hardly be intelligible without a brief notice of
this singular people.
2. They were, principally, the Penobscots in Maine; the Pawtuckets between Maine and Salem; the Massachusetts around the
Massachusetts Bay; the Pokanokets in south-eastern Massachusetts;
the Narragansets about Rhode Island; and the Pequods in the southern or south-eastern part of Connecticut.
3. There were indeed other tribes and divisions of tribes, such as
the Mohegans, the Nipmucks, the Wampanoags, &amp;c.; but they were
not numerous, and were generally tributary to the larger tribes. Nor
were the larger tribes so numerous as somre have hastily supposed.
Judicious authors on the subject have estimated the whole number at
only one hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand for the easterii.
middle, and southern states.
Indians and village.
4. The Indians had no houses, but lived chiefly in rude huts, or,
as tney were called, wigwarns.   These were built in the shape of
tents.  They were usually arranged in small clusters, or villages; one
wigwam often serving for several families.  Like the wandering Tartars, they often removed their villages.  A village contained, usually,
from fifty to two hundred inhabitants.
5. They knew little of agriculture, though in some places they
raised corn and beans, and a few peas, melons, &amp;e.     The emp]oyXXXIX.- 1, 2. What of the tribes of Indians in New England? 3. Other tribes

ments of the men were chiefly hunting, fishing and war. Of arts aind
manufactures they barely knew enough to make their wigwams, weapons of war and hunting, articles of dress and ornaments, and a few
domestic utensils and agricultural implements.
6. Their food was simple, coarse, plainly cooked, and, from their
natural indolence, sometimes scanty. At times they subsisted chiefly
on flesh - raw, roasted, or boiled, according to convenience. At
other times, when not too lazy to procure it, they subsisted on parched
corn, hommony, or a mixture of corn and beans, which they called
succotash. The.females usually prepared the food and cultivated the
vegetables.
7. Their dress, except in winter, consisted chiefly of a slight covering about the waist, with ornaments for the face, wrists or ankles.
In winter they dressed in untanned skins and in furs. They were
little affected by external beauty, even personal beauty, notwithstanding their fondness for ornament. In war, they painted their faces.
For amusements, they danced around a fire, or sung songs, or recited
stories of their victories.
8. Their hatchets, knives, and other implements, whether culinary
or warlike, were chiefly shells or sharp stones; more frequently the
latter. They pounded their corn in large stones, scooped or hollowed
out. The ground served them for chairs tables, and beds. Their
thread for nets, &amp;c., was made of the tendons of animals, or of coarse
bark, and their fish-hooks of bones. For money, they used wampum,
or beads made of shells.
9. The Indians had no books, or schools, or churches. They had,
it is true, some ideas of good and evil spirits, and perhaps of a future
existence beyond the grave; but their notions on this subject were
very crude, not to say confused; and their religion and religious worand manufactures? 6. Food? The women? 7. Dress? Amusements! 8. Utensils?

ship, when they had any, exerted but little influence on their general
conduct.
10. Polygamy was allowed among them; and though they conlid
hardly be said to be distinguished for licentiousness, there was not
among them that tender and respectful regard for the female sex
which is not only a principal element of human happiness, but one of
the strongest bonds of society. Their government and customs of
war will be seen in the progress of our history.
11. Diseases among the savages of America were fewer in number
than in civilized society; but they were sometimes very fatal, as in the
case of the small-pox. Their medical treatment was simple, consisting, for the most part, of a little herb tea, and warm or cold bathing;
sometimnes, however, they resorted to powows or sorcerers, who pretended to charm away diseases.
12. When an Indian died, the survivors dug a hole in the ground,
and, having wrapped the corpse in skins and mats, laid it therein.
Whatever was deemed most useful to the individual while living, as
his implements of war or hunting, were buried with him; probably
in the vague belief that they might be useful to him in a future state.
Some corpses were buried sitting, with their faces to the east.
CHAPTER XL.
Eliot, the Indian apostle.
1. ONE of the more important as well as more interesting results
of the union of the colonists was the civilization and improvement of

the Indians. During the peace with them, between the Pequod war
and the war with Philip, it pleased God to put it into the hearts of
many to do them good. Among these benefactors were several
persons of the name of Mayhew, and John Eliot.
2. One of the Mayhews had a church of one hundred communicants, at Martha's Vineyard. His son, Experience Mayhew, besides
having the charge of five or six congregations of Indians, learned
their language, and translated portions of the Bible into it. He also
wrote the lives of thirty native Indian preachers, and eighty pious
Indian mrnen, women and children. He spent sixty-three years of his
life in the ministry, chiefly among the Indians.
3. But no mlan was so greatly distinguished for his labors of love
among the Indians as John Eliot. He was born in England, in 1604.
In early life he was an usher in a grammar-school, under the Rev.
Thomnas Hooker, the celebrated individual who led sixty men, women
and children across the woods from Boston to Hartford, to settle Connecticut.
4. Mr. Eliot came to Boston in 1631, and was settled as a minister in Roxbury the next year, where he remained about sixty years,
or till his death. He had not been in Roxbury long before he began
to take a deep interest ish, the Indians, whom he believed to be the
descendants of the lost tribes of Israel.
5. The first thing he did for them was to learn their language.
This took him several years. The translation of the Bible into the
Indian language took up two years more. At the age of forty-two
he found himself sufficiently acquainted with their language to converse with them and teach them both publicly and in private.
6. Soon he was found in their wigwams teaching them and their
children to read, praying with them, telling them about God, preaching short and plain sermons to them, discouraging the use of strong
drinks, as well as all their favorite vices, instructing them in farming
and gardening, and endeavoring in every possible way to make them
wiser and better.
7. Mr. Eliot not only told them what to do, but he actually set
them to work, and sometimes worked with them. He furnished the men
with spades, shovels, crow-bars, &amp;c., and the women with spinningwheels. He set up schools and churches among them, and prepared
ministers and schoolmasters. So faithful and numerous were his
labors, that he hlas obtained the name of the Indian Apostle.
8. The following anecdote will serve to show the nature of Mr.
Eliot's influence. One Sabbath evening, at coming in from church,
a converted Indian found his fire gone out, and, in order to kindle it,
he split a little dry wood with his hatchet. This was thought by
many of the Indians a breach of the Sabbath, and was, at their next
meeting, taken up and discussed.
9. Mr. Eliot labored more particularly around Boston -in Roxbury, Dorchester, Newton, Watertown and Natick. He was especially employed at a place called Nonantum, now in Newton, and at

Natick. But he also went abroad, and labored in the region about
Lowell, Lancaster, Brookfield, Yarmouth and elsewhere. He nol
only translated the Bible, but other books. into the Indian language.
10. In short, the good he did was incalculable. In 1660, there
were tesi towns near Boston in which the Indians were, for the most
part, professedly pious, and were, till Philip's war, fast adopting the
customs, &amp;c., of civilization. Even in 1686, after Mr. E.'s death, the
number of "Praying Indians," as they were called, was estimated at
five thousand; and, in 1696, thirty Indian churches existed.
11. Mr. Eliot was regarded, in his day, as somewhat eccentric; but
it was chiefly because he was good. lie hated personal ornaments
and useless expenditures. He was opposed to wigs, wine and tobacco!
He wished to have everything so managed that it might accomplish
the greatest good to mankind, and the greatest glory to God
CHAPTER; XLI.
Witchcraft in New England.
1. IT was during the long period of peace which has been alluded
to in the foregoing chapter, that the troubles arose in Massachusetts
about witchcraft, of which so much has been said in history, and on
account of which such heavy charges have been made against oni
forefathers.
2. The first case of the kind occurred in Springfield, in 1645. In
June, 1648, the charge of witchcraft was brought against Margaret
Jones, of Charlestown, and she was executed. Ann Hibbins of,
Boston, came next; she was executed in 1656. Here the subject
rested for about thirty years, when it was again revived; and there
was one more execution in Boston.
3. Four years afterward, viz., in 1692, the supposed witchcraft
broke out in Salem and Danvers. Here the first subjects of it were
children. The disorder, whatever its character may have been,
spread to the neighboring country towns, particularly Andover, Ipswich and Gloucester. At first it affected the lower classes only; but
at length it pervaded all ranks and conditions.
4. Two daughters of a minister, in Salem, were strangely affected.
Before this, they had been quiet, happy children, but now they began
to look wild, shriek, tell strange stories, sit barefoot among the ashes,
or go abroad with their clothes and hair in great disorder, looking
like insane people. Sometimes they were dumb; at others they
would complain of being pricked severely with pins.
5. The madness continuing to spread, the charge of witchcraft
was at length brought against one poor minister himself. All sorts
of strange stories were told about him. It was especially said that
of Eliot? 9. Where did Eliot chiefly bestow his efforts? 10. What effect did Eliot's

he had intercourse with the devil; and the fact that he was an
uncommonly athletic and strong man, with many favored this idea.
He would not confess guilt, and was hanged. Those who confessed
the crime of witchcraft were not executed.
6. It was, indeed, a fearful time. Multitudes were suspected
and accused, and, at one period, no less that one hundred and fifty
were in prison for witchcraft. What number were actually executed
while " the fever lasted," is not quite certain. It is generally said
that two hundred were accused, one hundred and fifty imprisoned,
twenty-eight condemned, nineteen hanged, and one pressed to death.
7. But the excitement at length passed away; and the more
rapidly in proportion as the criminals were treated with clemency.
Multitudes owned, at length, that they confessed their guilt to save
their lives! For a century past little has been said of witchcraft in
the United States, and few believe in its existence. The events we
have narrated are supposed to have been the result of delusion.
8. Nor was this disease, or delusion, much known in this country,
even in its day, out of New England. One old woman was indeed
accused of the crime in Pennsylvania. Penn, himself, happened to
be the judge, and gave the charge to the jury. They brought in a
verdict that her friends should be bound for her to keep the peace;
which put an end to witchcraft in that province.
9. Supposed cases of witchcraft had been common in Europe for
centuries, and, about the time of the excitement in New England,
thousands were executed in England and othler countries there.
CHAPTER XLII.
New York, New Jersey and Delaware.
L NEW JERSEY began to be settled in 1624, at Bergen. A few
Dutch families crossed from New York about the same time, and
settled at Jersey city. The English began a settlemenit on the Delaware, in 1640, but it was soon broken up by the Swedes, who had
settled on the opposite side of the river, and who retained the country
fifteen years, till it was taken by the Dutch and held till 1664, when
it passed into the hands of the English.
2. In 1674 the province was divided into East and West Jersey;
and it continued thus till the year 1702, when the two provinces
were again united in one, though they were still considered as forming
a part of the state of New York. They were not finally separated
from New York till the year 1738.
3. The first settlement effected in the present state of Delaware
was in the year 1627, by the Swedes and Finns. The Dutch
claimed the country, and a quarrel was kept up a long time between

them and the Swedes. When the former gave up New York and
New Jersey, Delaware was given up with them, but was still considered a part of New York. From 1682 to 1703, it was a part of Pennsylvania.
4. The Dutch at New York with some difficulty held out against
the Indians and other nations till 1664, when Stuyvesant, the governor,
surrendered all their possessions on or about the Hudson to the
English. The Dutch, it is true, retook the town of New York,
during a war with the English, in 1673; but they restored it again
the next year.
5. Colonel Richard Nichols, the officer to whom the Dutch surrendered, was the first English governor of New York. He was
succeeded, three years afterward, by Colonel Lovelace. It was not,
however, till 1683, that the people had any voice in the election of
their rulers. Some changes were made, at this time, but they gave
only partial satisfaction.
6. Bad or defective, however, as the government may have been
at the first, more real progress was made, not only in agriculture,
but in almost everything else, in one year under the English, than
infive years under the Dutch rulers. The Duttch, in the United
States, with the best soil, accomplished less than the emigrants of any
other nation.
CHAPTER XLIII.
Settlement of the Carolinas.
1. THE coast of Carolina was explored in 1563, and named after
Charles IX., of France. The first attempt at a settlement, and
indeed one of the first ever made within the present limits of the
United States, was by Sir Walter Raleigh, in 1585, twenty-two
years before Jamestown was settled. and thirty-five years before the
landing at Plymouth.
2. The fleet which brought out the first colonists to Carolina
anchored off the island of Wocokon, the southern point of the chain
of islands and sand-bars which form Ocracoke inlet. From this
island, the chief officer of the fleet went to the continent, and, during
an absence of eight days, discovered several Indian towns.
3. He next sailed to the Roanoke river, where he landed with
one hundred and seven persons, designed to form a colony. After
remaining with them a short time, he left them under the care of a
Mr. Lane, and returned to England.
4. The selection of a governor for the colonists could not have
been more unfortunate. After remaining at the spot about a year,
and acomplishing nothing, except to manifest a high degree of selfishness and shake the faith of the natives in all white men, Sir

Francis Drake, who had touched there with a fleet, took them back
to England.
5. No fuirther attempts were made to settle the country till sometime between the years 1640 and 1650, when a few planters from
Virginia, under the direction of Governor Berlley, of that province,
began a colony in Albemarle county, within the present limits of
North Carolina.
6. In 16(i3, the whole country, from the 30th to the 36th degree of
north latitude, and, in the extravagant language of those times, from
the Atlantic to the South Sea, was conveyed by Charles II. to Lord
Clarendon and his associates, with full power to settle and govern it.
In 1665, a settlement was made near the mouth of the Clarendon or
Cape Fear river, by emigrants from Barbadoes; and Sir James
Yeomans was appointed governor.
7. A settlement was made, in 1670, at Port Royal, in South Carolina, by Governor Sayle; and, in 1671, a few persons located themselves at Old Charleston, as it was called, on Ashley river. In 1680,
the latter spot was abaMdoned, and the foundation laid of the present
city of Charleston, several miles nearer the sea.
8. Up to that year, 1671, all the various settlements which have
here been mentioned went by the general name of Carolina. At this
time, however, a division took place, and the northern and southern
provinces began to be known by the distinctive names of North and
South Carolina.
9. It was not far from this time, during the administration of
Governor Sayle, that an attempt was made in South Carolina to
reduce to practice the notions, respecting government, of John Locke,
the philosopher. But the plan was opposed with a degree of bitterness which led to its speedy abandonment, and a return to the old
form of government.
CHAPTER XLIV.
The war with Philip.
1. WE have elsewhere seen that Massasoit, the sachem  of the
Wampanoags, remained a true friend of the English to the time of
his death. He left two sons, whom, in his zeal to show his affection
for the English, he had called Alexander and Philip. The early
death of Alexander left the kingdom to Philip.
2. Philip resided at Mount Hopo, now Bristol, R. I. Though
at first friendly to the whites, he soon proved to be their most powerful and deadly foe. No doubt he had reasons for his conduct, which
satisfied himself; for the English, in their dealings, were not always

either prudent or just. Bancroft says he was "hurried into his
rebellion."
3. A conspiracy appears to have been got up among the Indians,
about the year 1675, of which Philip was supposed to be the leader,
to destroy the English, or at least to drive them out of the country.
Sassamon, a native Indian preacher, revealed the secret, and Philip
murdered him; he then, perhaps to cover his own crimes, rushed
into a war.
Philip stirring up the Indians.
4. The first attack which the Indians made, under Philip, was at
Swanzey, in Plymouth colony, June 24, 1675. In the fear of war, a
day of fasting and prayer had been appointed, and the people were
going home from church, when the savages fell upon them and
killed eight or nine of their number. They had, however, begun to
rob houses and kill cattle some time before.
5. Massachusetts, on hearing thc news, immediately sent troops
to aid Plymouth in opposing Philip. On the 29th of June, the united
forces made an attack on the chief, and killed six of his men; and
compelled him to flee to a swamp now in Tiverton. Here, for some
time, he was able to defend himself, and even to gain some advantages over his assailants.
6. It was at length determined to surround the swamp and starve
out the Indians, as the only method of conquering them; but Philip,
suspecting the design, found means to escape to the Nipmucks, a
small tribe in Worcester county, and induce them to join him. The
English sent ambassadors and troops to make a treaty with the Nipmucks, but they were ambushed, and eight of them killed and as
many wounded.
7. Those of the colonists who escaped, fled to Brookfield. The

Indians pursued them and burnt the village, excepting only the house
they occupied. To this also they laid seige, and for two days poured
their musket balls upon it, though to little purpose, except to destroy
one man.
8. Unable to gain their point by force, the Indians attempted a
stratagem. They dipped rags and other comnbustibles in brimstone,
and, by means of these and other things, they set fire to the house,
guarding the doors at the same time, in order to destroy any who
should attempt to escape. A sudden shower of rain, as if designed
for this purpose, extinguished the flames and saved its inmates.
9. It was August 14; - that very day, and, according to historians,
at the critical moment when the Indians, seeing the fire extinguished,
were about to renew the attempt to burn it, a reinforcement of fifty
men arrived. The Indians were dispersed, and some of them slain.
10. But this did not put an end to hostilities. In truth, the storm
of war was but now gathering - a most fearful war, too. It was the
season of harvest, and every hour of time and every sheaf of grain
were needed to meet the wants of the coming winter. This period is
thus described by the historian:
11. " The laborer in the field, the reapers as they went forth to
harvest, men as they went to mill, the shepherd boy among the sheep,
were shot down by skulking foes, whose approach was invisible.
Who can tell the heavy hours of woman  The mother, if left alone
in the house, feared the tomahawk for herself and children. On the
sudden attack, the husband would fly with one child, the wife with
another, and perhaps only one escape.
12. "The village cavalcade making its way to meeting, on Sundays, in files on horseback, the farmer holding the bridle in one hand
and a child in the other, his wife seated on a pillion behind him -it
may be with a child in her lap -as was the custom of those days,
could not proceed safely-bullets would come whizzing by them.
The Indians hung upon the skirts of the English villages, like the
lightning upon the edge of the clouds."
CHAPTER XLV.
Events of the war with Philip.
1. BUT Philip, with his warriors well armed, and the Nipmucks,
were not alone. He had drawn to his alliance most of the tribes
throughout New England, and was prosecuting the war with new
vigor. During the summer and autumn, Hadley, Deerfield, Northampton and Springfield, in the west, and Dover, Exeter, Saco, Scar7, 8, 9. What of the colonists who fled to Brookfield? 9. What happened August 147

borough and Kittery, in the north and east, were made to feel the
force of his vengeance.
2. The fate of Captain Lathrop was most melancholy. With
eighty young men - the flower of Essex county- he was escorting
some teams, with grain, from Deerfield to Hadley. In passing
through a thick wood, soon after leaving Deerfield, they stopped to
pick a few grapes. Suddenly they were attacked by several hundred
Indians, and seventy young men were slain, with twenty of the teamsters.
3. On hearing the noise of the guns, troops were sent from Deerfield to their assistance, who arrived in time to kill or wound one hundred and fifty of the Indians, and disperse the rest, with the loss of
only two men. The battle-ground was long known by the name of
Bloody-Brook, now near the village of Muddy Brook.
4. Another anecdote of this war is curious. Goffe, one of the
judges who had doomed Charles I. to death, was in New England
at this time, and one of his hiding-places was at Hadley.  The
Indians' attacked that place in September. On their arrival, Goffe, in
a strange dress, suddenly placed himself at the head of the citizens,
drove off the Indians, and disappeared. The wondering inhabitants
believed, for some time, that an angel had been sent for their relief.
5. The Narraganset Indians, though they would not fight the English, were known to afford shelter to their enemies, and thus act against
them indirectly. It was, therefore, resolved to wage war against
them; and the united colonies sent out a body of eighteen hundred
men, with one hundred and fifty friendly Indians, to attack them in
their quarters, amid the deep snows of December.
6. They found them in a great swamp in Kingston, Rhode Island.
On a rising ground, in the swamp, was their fort. After a severe
battle of three hours, the fort was taken and burnt. The Indians lost
about one thousand of their number, including women and children,
and five hundred or six hundred wigwams.  Only a few of them
escaped. The English had about two hundred and thirty killed and
wounded.
7. The few remaining Indians were greatly distressed by this
defeat. Without food or shelter, many perished; and, of those who
survived, the most were compelled to subsist on anything they could
find- acorns, ground-nuts, horse-flesh, &amp;c.  But they would not
yield. "We will fight," said Canonchet, their chief, "to the last
man. "
8. Relics of the great Narraganset fight were to be seen within
the memory of some persons now living. It is not long since an
Indian pipe and various Indian utensils were dug up on the battleground. Nor is it yet half a century since charred corn was found,
having lain there about one hundred and thirty years.

8.6DEATH OF PHILIP.
CHAPTER XLV1.
Death of Philip.
1. WE have seen that the Indians, though greatly reduced, were
not yet destroyed. Philip had at first fled to the far west, to induce
the Mohawks to join him, but his countrymen of the various tribes
in New England had been roused to the work of burning and
murdering; and, in the spring of 1676, Philip returned and joined
them.
2. The depredations of the savages, during the winter of 1675
and the spring of 1676, were almost innumerable.  Among the
bands who were murdered were Captains Wadsworth and Pierce,
with fifty men each. The latter had also twenty friendly Indians,
who were killed. Among the towns burnt, either partly or wholly,
were Lancaster, Medfield, Weymouth, Groton, Springfield, Sudbury
and Marlborough in Massachusetts, and Providence and Warwick in
Rhode Island.
3. Philip, at his return from the west, attempted to hide himself near Mount Hope. Concealment, however, was impossible.
All New England was in arms against him, as he. was in arms
against all New England. Even his own followers- perhaps to
make better' terms for themselves with the English-began to plbt
against hiimi.
4. One cannot help pitying the poor man; for, though a savage,
he had a soul. He could, perhaps, have borne tihe mere destruction
of his nation, but'-he met with a loss, soon after his return, which
affected him more than anything else, and severed the last ties which
bound him to the land of his-fathers.
5. The loss referred to was that of his wife and only son, then a
mere boy, but the king, in prospect, of the ancient tribe of the Wampanoags. The mother and the child were taken prisoners by the
English. The youth was transported to Bermuda and sold as a slave.
"My heart breaks," said the despairing chief, when he heard this;
"now I am ready to die."
6. Nor did he survive long. His hiding-place, in the swamp, was
soon found out, and Captain Church, with a body of troops, was sent
against him. On his arrival at the swamp he placed his men around
it in such a way that Philip might be discovered, should he try to
escape. They then commenced firing.
7. The soldiers had scarcely begun the attack when Philip seized
his gun and attempted to escape; but, in doing so, he ran towards an
English soldier and an Indian acting with his enemies. The Englishman snapped his gun, but it missed fire. The Indian then fired, and
Philip received the contents of the gun in his heart.
8. The war continued, for a time, in the province of Maine, but at

length it ceased. The chiefs came and submitted themselves k the
English, and a permanent treaty was concluded. The war, however,
had bednate/ frrille one for feeble coloties to sustain. They lost, at
least, six hundred men, six hundred dwelling-houses, and from twelve
to twenty villages. The whole of New England scarcely contained,
at the time, one hundred and twenty-five thousand white inhabitants,
or twenty-five thousand figlhting men.
CHAPTER XLVII.
Bacon's Rebellion.
1. BETWEEN the years 1624 and 1639, serious difficulties had
arisen among the colonists in Virginia about their government. The
king had taken away their charter, and was ruling them in his own
way, and by means of such governors as he was pleased to send out.
In one instance, so much dissatisfaction existed with regard to the
royal governor, that the people sent him home to England. The king,
however, sent him back.
2. In 1639, Governor Berkley was appointed in his stead, and
the people were, once more, permitted to choose their representatives.  Grateful for the privilege, they remained attached to the
cause of the king, even after Cromwell had taken the reins of government. For this the parliament was offended, and Governor Berkley
was removed; at the death of Cromwell, he was, however, restored
to them.
3. But, by this time, either he or the Virginians were somewhat
changed. They grew dissatisfied with his conduct, and sent in petitions to the crown against him; but these were disregarded.  At
length, in 1676, the year of Philip's death, the difficulties which
existed ripened into an open rebellion.
4. Nathaniel Bacon, a bold, enterprising, eloquent, but ambitious
young man, a member of the governor's council, was at the head of
the rebel party. The colony had just engaged in a war with the
Susquehannah Indians. Bacon demanded of the governor a commission in the army, but being refused, a contention ensued between
them, which ended in Bacon's suspension from the council.
5. He was, however, soon afterward restored to his office, upon
which he renewed his request for a commission; but, being again
refused, he collected a band of six hundred men, and marched at once
to Jamestown. The genera] assembly was in session, and, being
unarmed, was forced to submit to his terms, and give him a commission.
6. But he was no sooner gone, than the governor denounced him
as a rebel; upon which, instead of marching against the SusquehanXLVII. - 1. What of the governmnent of Virginia between 1624 and 1639? 2. What

nah Indians, according to the intention of his commission, he returned
in great wrath to Jamestown. The aged governor fled to the eastern
shore, and, having collected a small force, recrossed the bay to oppose
him.
7. The colony was thus involved in all the horrors of a civil war
The rebel party burnt Jamestown, many houses in the country were
pillaged, and whole districts laid waste. Trhe wives of some of the
governor's party were even taken from their homes, and carried to the
rebel camp.
8. But, in the midst of these calamities, Bacon suddenly sickened
and died. His followers, left without a leader, and without a definite
object in view, began to disperse. His generals surrendered and were
pardoned. And thus expired the flames of a war that had already
cost the colony about half a million of dollars.
9. Governor Berkley now reentered upon the duties of his office.
But, though peace was restored, the progress of the colony had been
retarded in various ways. Husbandry, in particular, had been greatly
neglected, and the people were once more threatened with famine.
About this time Governlor Berkley returned to England, and soon
after died.
10. The colony had other difficulties, in the years 1679 and 1680,
in regard to raising a revenue; and much dissatisfaction prevailed
with Lord Culpepper, the successor of Berkley. The truth is, the
great question of liberty and independence was already germinating
in the colonies- to shoot forth, a century afterward, into full growth.
CHAPTER XLVIH.
Religious Persecution.
1. WE have seen that it was persecution for the sake of religious
opinion that drove our ancestors, the Puritans, to seek a home in the
woods of New England; but we have not yet shown, except, perhaps, in the case of Roger Williams, that they brought with them
a measure of the same intolerance from which they had attempted
to fly.
2. The spirit of persecution appeared, in the greatest violence, in
their proceedings against the Friends or Quakers. These people were
the followers of George Fox, who believed and taught that we must
obey a divine light within as superior to all other guides, and that we
must not think too much of external forms. He began to spread his
doctrines in England in 1647.
3. In 1656, twelve of his followers appeared in Massachusetts.

CHAPTER I.
The progress of History.
I IN the fbllowing pages we propose to give a history of the
United States, with some account of other portions of America.
History is a recital of what has happened, respecting nations and
countries; and our history of America will be an account of the most
interesting events that have occurred in the new world.
2. All our readers know that the history of mankind begins with
Adam and Eve, almost 6000 years ago; that their descendants spread
over Asia first, then over Africa, and then over Europe.
3. At what time mankind began to settle in Europe we cannot
precisely tell: we only know that about 1856 years B. C., or about
3700 years ago, a man by the name of Inachus led a company of
emigrants from Egypt into Greece.
4. These found the country inhabited by savages, who, no doubt,
were the descendants of those who had wandered there from Asia.
Inachus and his companions established themselves in Greece, and
from that point of time, Europe gradually became occupied by civilized people.
5. Thus the three quarters of the globe were settled; and as they

The general court, believing their doctrine to be hostile to good
order and pure religion, banished them from the colony, and passed
laws to prevent the coming of any more. The penalty of bringing a
Quaker into the province was one hundred pounds sterling, and the
Quaker himself was to be whipped twenty lashes, and sentenced to
hard labor.
A Quaker on trial.
4. Still worse than even this afterwards happened. In 1657 it was
decreed that Quakers coming into the province should have their
tongues bored with a hot iron, and banished. In short, no severities
were deemed too great for a people so heretical.
5. Their books even were prohibited. Any person who spread
or secreted such books was to be fined five pounds. For defending
their doctrines in any way, there was a fine of two pounds for the
first offence, four for the second, and confinement and banishment for
the third.
6. The persecution against the Quakers continuing, the king wroto
a letter to the governor of Massachusetts, requesting him to send
them to England for trial. The governor and the court were so fat
moved to toleration by this letter, that twenty-eight Quakers, then in
prison- some of them under sentence of death - were released, and
only banished from the province.
7. But, though the king was unwilling the colonists should proceed so violently against the Quakers, he suffered them to be fined
because they would not take oaths, and for the third offence to be
banished. Similar persecutions also took place in Virginia, or those
rather which were worse; for laws were there made against every
sect but the prevailing one -the Episcopal or English church.

8. The truth is, that the spirit of persecution has generally been in
the world, and is not confined to age, country or religion. Mr. Jefferson, in"speaking of the persecution of the Quakers in Virginia, observes, that if no execution took place there, as there did in New England, "it was not owing to the moderation of the church or spirit of
the legislature."
9. There seems to be one exception to the general truth of the
sentiment that the spirit of persecution has always prevailed. The
government of Rhode Island, having passed an act to outlaw Quakers
and seize their estates, because they would not bear arms, the people
were so opposed to it that the law could not be carried into effect.
For this, however, the world is probably indebted to Roger Williams.
10. Even in Massachusetts the persecution was carried so far that
the colony lost many friends by it. A law, passed in 1677, for apprehending and punishing, by fine and correction, every person found at
a Quaker's meeting, had this effect. As a consequence, we hear little
more afterwards of laws against the Quakers.
11. It may be true- it no doubt is true- that the heretics, as they
were called, were sometimes in fault. Ann Hutchinson certainly
uttered some foolish things; and the Quakers did that which it was not
wise for them to do; and so, perhaps, of the Baptists and Jesuits.
This, however, did not justify violent persecutions against them.
12. But persecution began in this country even before 1656, the
time of proceeding against the Quakers. John Wheelwright was
banished, in 1637, for preaching sedition - and, also, Ann Hutchinson.
The Anabaptists or Baptists were persecuted in 1644; though no
prosecution was actually brought against them till 1666. One of the
charges against Roger Williams was that he was a Baptist.
13. in 1647, moreover, an act was passed in Massachusetts against
the Jesuits. Again, in 1700, the assembly of New York passed an
act against Jesuits and Popish priests, which was followed by a similar law in Massachusetts the same year. These were, accordingly,
compelled to leave the province.

land; and to impress upon the mind their forms and relative position.

2. In March, 1681, William   Penn received the territory of Pennsylvania, comprising 26,000,000 acres, on account of a claim of his
father on the British government for sixteen thousand pounds sterlinfg - or less-than one third of a cent an acre.  At first the grant
interfered with prior grants to the founders of Maryland and Virginia, and caused long and angry contentions; but they were finally
adjusted.

3. The lands were offered for sale in lots of one thousand acres
each, at about a penny an acre; and many of the persecuted Quakers
in England were induced to purchase. In the autumn of 1681, two
ships, with passengers, arrived in the Delaware, and began a settlement just above the entrance of the Schuylkill.
4. Swedish settlements, along the western bank of the Delaware,
had existed, at the arrival of the Quakers, for about fifty years, but
they had been considered as belonging to New Jersey; nor were
they, in fact, very flourishing. Penn may, therefore, be justly considered as the founder and father of Pennsylvania.
5. With the emigrants who were to occupy his lands, Penn had
transmitted fiull instructions how to proceed. They were early to lay
the foundation of a new city, but, instead of having it resemble the
crowded cities of the old world, it was to be so planted with gardens around each house, as to form a "greene country towne."
This was the origin of the beautiful squares and commons of Philadelphia.
6. He also wrote to the Indians, at the same time, assuring them
of his disposition to treat them kindly as brethren, and to deal with
them justly; entreating them, as they were all children of the Great
Spirit, to receive and treat his people in the same kind manner.
7. In October, 1682, Penn took leave of his family and came over
to America himself. He was accompanied by a hundred emigrants;
or, according to some authorities, by many more. These were followed, soon, by others, so that the whole Quaker population of the
province amounted to two thousand. Of the Swedes and Finns there
were, at this time, about three thousand.
8. Penn had planned a form of government before he set out, but
found it necessary to modify it after his arrival. It provided for a
governor, a council of three, and a house of delegates to be chosen
by the freemen. Every person was to be a freeman who professed
faith in Christ, and sustained a good moral character; and all who
believed in one God were to worship according to the dictates of their
consciences.
9. He had not been long in the country before he made an effort to
bring together the Indians from various parts, to form a treaty of
peace and friendship. They met at Philadelphia, and made the
treaty at what is now called Kensington, under a large elm tree.
This treaty, unlike most Indian treaties, was never broken. " Not a
drop of Quaker blood was ever shed by an Indian."
10. Penn was, for some time, the governor of the colony; and,
under his wise and excellent management, both of the white people
and the Indians, the colony wvas peaceful, prosperous and happy,
almost beyond example. It is true it had a fine climate and soil, in

11. But Penn did something more than merely to act as the
executive officer of the colony. He was, at once, governor, magistrate, preacher, teacher and laborer. He was, in truth, all things to
all men, and acceptable to all. He obeyed the golden rule of the
Divine law, and taught everybody else to obey it.
12. In 1684, he returned to England, leaving the colony in the
care of five commissioners. Here he was imprisoned several times
for disloyalty, and the government of Pennsylvania, in one instance,
was taken away from him. But it was afterwards restored to him;
and, in 1699, he came once more to America.
13. Delaware, as we have seen, was, at first, included in the
province of Pennsylvania. But, about the time of which we are now
speaking, Delaware became a distinct colony, with its own government and officers. This was the result of a new charter by Penn, in
which the rights and limits of Pennsylvania were distinctly defined.
14. For more than seventy years all things went on prosperously
in Pennsylvania, especially in all their transactions with the Indians.
It was not till the year 1754, when Penn and his pacific principles
had begun to be forgotten, that the colony became involved in an Indian war.
CHAPTER L.
Character of Penn.
1. WILLIAM PENN, the founder of Pennsylvania, and one of the
truly great men of the earth, was the son of Admiral Penn, of London. He was early placed at the University of Oxford, but having,
while there, become inclined to the doctrinles of the Quakers. he was
expelled.
2. His expulsion from college was a sore trial to his father, who
aimed at his preferment; and he resorted to every measure in his
power to reclaim him. Sometimrnes, for this purpose, he kept him in
his own family; at others, he sent him abroad. But he was so
firmly attached to the Quaker principles, that nothing could shake
him. He would not even uncover his head in the presence of great
or distinguished men.
3. His father consented to indulge him in all his peculiarities
except the last. His hat, he insisted, must be pulled off, at least in
the presence of the king and the Duke of York. He begged his son
to consider the matter and give him an answer. The latter, after
much fasting and prayer, decided lnot to comply with his father's
wishes.

4. Admiral Penn, enraged at this, turned his son out of doors, and
would not, for a considerable time, be reconciled to him. During a
long exile from the paternal roof, he was supported by his mother and
other relatives. At length the father, finding him immovable, restored him to his family.
Portrait of Penn.
5. Many a time was he persecuted, out of the precincts of the
family, and many a time was he imprisoned. All, however, did not
avail to change him. What he regarded as right, he was determined
to do, even though his conduct were to lead him to the stake or the
gibbet.
6. Yet, strongly resolved as he was to do right, he seems to have
been but rarely, if ever, vindictive; on the contrary, he was one of
the mildest, most forbearing men in the world. Even in the heat and
rashness of youth, he would not injure anybody -not so much as an
enemy. While in the streets of Paris, one day, a man drew his
sword upon him, but Penn only disarmed him, without attempting to
hurt him.

endure. How strange it is, that while Alexander and Cesar and
Napoleon find thousands to celebrate their bravery, those who conquer and govern in the spirit of the Prince of peace live comparatively
unnoticed and die almost unknown! Penn died in England about the
year 1718, aged seventy-four years.
CHAPTER LI.
Governor Andros and the Charter Oak.
1. ABOUT the year 1685, King James, of England, took away the
charters of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Plymouth, resolving to
govern them in his own way. Joseph Dudley was, by his direction,
made president of all the provinces except Plymouth.  He came over
early the following year. He was, however, succeeded, the next
December, by Edmund Andros.
2. The short administration of Dudley had been comparatively tolerable; but Andros was a complete tyrant.  He glittered in scarlet
and lace, but these had beneath them a little soul. He vainly sought to
please his king and immortalize his own name, by retarding the prosperity of a few petty settlements in the wilds of America.
3. He was instructed to restrain the printing press as much as he
could. Printing had been introduced in 1639, and the freeman's oath,
an almanac, and some other things had been printed.  The press had
been watched all this while; still it had been free. But Andros
would not allow so much as an almanac to be printed without his
consent.
4. The schools of learning, hitherto so well attended to, he suffered to go to decay. The usual support was withheld from religious
institutions. Obstacles were thrown in the way of freedom in civil
elections. The customs of the country were made light of and ridiculed, and even personal liberty was enidangered.
5. As Connecticut seemed disinclined to give up her charter, An
dros attempted compulsion.  While the general assembly was in ses
sion at Hartford, in 1687, he went there, entered the hall, and denmanded their charter. The governor objected to giving it up, and the
discussion was intentionally continued till it was quite dark.
6. As evening came on, and the candles were lighted, the charter
was brought in and laid on the table, as if it was about to be given
up. At a concerted signal every light was extinguished, and a guard
of men seized the charter, and under cover of the darkness, carried it
to the south part of the city, and hid it in a hollow oak, which, to this
day, goes by the name of the Charter Oak.

7. The candles were relighted, but nothing was to be found of tlhe
charter. Andros did not give up his purpose, however. He still
insisted on holding the reins of the government, and the people submitted to the haughty dictator. Though they retained the charter,
Andros selected his counsellors, and proceeded to manage the government of the colony in his own way.
CHAPTER LII.
King William's War.
1. WHILE Andros was pursuing his course of tyranny over the
colonies, an unseen hand was preparing for their relief  What is usually called the Revolution in England, had taken place. King James
had fled, and William, prince of Orange, had succeeded him. This
gave great joy throughout England and America.
2. In the moment of exultation, and in remembrance of past abuses,
the people of Boston seized Governor Andros and fifty of his most
active supporters, and sent them away to England, to answer for their
misdeeds. Connecticut and Rhode Island resumed their charters, and
Massachusetts obtained a new one; and thus tb~ey returned to the old
order of things.
3. But, though relieved in one way, by the Revolution, they were
burdened by it in another. King James had fled to France, and stirred
up the French to a war with England, in which the northern American colonies were most deeply concerned; and, on account of which
they became, in the end, very great sufferers.
4. The governor of Canada, as a good and loyal subject of the
king of France, not only prepared to annoy the English colonies, but
also to set the Indians at work. Still worse than all this, he not only
set them to work, but encouraged them to plunder, burn and put to
death, without regarding age or sex.
5. It needed but little to excite the Indians to deeds of cruelty.
Accordingly, we find that, on the night of Feb. 8, 1690, one division
of the French Canadian and Indian army attacked Schenectady, while
the inhabitants were asleep, with the gates open, suspecting no danger, and completely depopulated the village.
6. The scene was ohe of the most terrible which can be imagined.
In a very few minutes only, after the attack, the whole village, or
nearly the whole of it, was in a blaze. The unoffending citizens,
sick or well, old or young, male or female, were dragged from their
beds and murdered. Sixty were killed, thirty made prisoners, and
the rest fled - most of them naked - through deep snow, to Albany.
Of those who fled, twenty-five lost their limbs merely by the cold.

97STORY OF GOVERNOR FLETCHER.
7. Another party of the enemy fell upon the village of Salmon
Falls, in New Hampshire, which, after killing thirty of its inhabitants, they burnt. Fifty-four were carried into captivity, to suffer
tortures more dreadful than death. And thus it was, in a greater or
less degree, all along the northern frontier of the colonies.
8. rThe spirit of the colonists was roused by these atrocities, and
they were determined on a stern resistance. A fleet of eight small
vessels, with seven hundred or eight hundred men, under the command of Sir William Phipps, was sent against Port Royal, in Nova
Scotia, which surrendered with little or no resistance; and the
invading army took possession of the whole coast from Port Royal to
Maine.
9. Sir William Phipps was also to sail up the St. Lawrence, with
his fleet, while two thousand men from New York and New England
were to march by way of Lake Champlain, and meet him before
Quebec. The land forces arrived in October, but, owing to adverse
winds and other causes, the fleet did not arrive, and the troops were
obliged to return.
10. Instead, therefore, of endinrg the war by a heavy blow at
Canada, it seems to have been but little more than begun. The Indians, on the northern and western frontier, became more and more
troublesome, and the French more and more warlike. An attempt
against them, by Major Schuyler, in 1692, was little more successful
than that of the preceding year.
11. At last, the war became one of continual attack on our frontiers, and of feeble attempts of the colonies at defence. Thus matters
went on about seven years, during which period the sufferings of oui
countrymen were severe, almost beyond description; and their condi
tion seemed almost without hope.
12. Tired themselves of this sort of war, the French, in 1697, sent
out a large fleet, to be aided by fifteen hundred men from  Canada,
with orders to burn Boston and New York and ravage the country.
The fleet arrived on the coast too late to meet the land army, and thus
the colonies were saved. A treaty of peace was concluded in the
month of Decemnber following.

2. Connecticut and New Haven had been united long before this,
and the general assembly met alternately at Hartford and New Haven.
It was now sitting at Hartford. They refused to obey the request of
Governor Fletcher. At this refusal the governor went to Hartford
himnself, to compel them to obey.

and review. When Governor Fletcher rode up, Captain Wadsworth,
the senior officer of the company, was walkinrg in front of his men and
giving the word of command in the usual way, and appeared to take
no notice of any one else.

he called his commission for commanding the troops. "Beat the
drums," said Captain Wadsworth, as soon as he perceived what was
coming; and forthwith there was such a rattling of half a dozen kettle

was there a moment of silence, than Wadsworth, who was a very stout

his troops to drum, and turniing to Fletcher, said, "If I am interrupted
again, I will make daylight shine through you."
