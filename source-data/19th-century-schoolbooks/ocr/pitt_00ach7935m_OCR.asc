o “ They are searching for lyou. There is a half bat-
talion there.”
“ Well,” said the Marquis, “ letus go on.”
And he took a step in the direction of the farm.
5 The man seized him by the arm.
“Do not go there.” '
“And where would you have me go?”
“ Home with me.”
The Marquis looked at the beggar.  
10 “ Listen, Marquis, my home is notﬁne ; but it is safe.
A hut lower than a cave. For a ﬂoor, a bed of sea-
weed ; . for a ceiling, a roof of branches and grass.

‘ ’ Come. You would be shot at the farm. With me

you will go to sleep. You must be tired; and to-
15 morrow morning the Blues will march away, and you
can go wherever you please.”
The Marquis studied the man.
“And you wish to save me?”
“ Yes.”

20” “Why?” .
“Because I said: ‘There is another poorer than I.

I have the right to breathe, he has not.’ ”
“ But do you know that a price has been put on my
head?”
25 “ Yes.”
“ How did you know ?”
“ I read the placard.”  
“ Then, since you have read the placard, you know that

the man who betrays me will win sixty thousand francs.”

« I know it.”  

“ Do you know that sixty thousand francs is a
fortune ? ”

“ Yes.”

“ And that the one who will deliver me up will make
his fortune ? ”

— “ That is just what I thought. When I saw you I
said to myself: ‘ Only think of it, the one Who betrays
this very man will win sixty thousand francs and
make his fortune! ‘Let us hasten to conceal him.’ ”

The Marquis followed the poor man. They entered
a thicket. Here was the beggar’s den. It was a sort of

They stooped, crept along a little way, entered the

room cut up into odd compartments by the great

tree-roots, and sat down on a heap of seaweed, which  

served as a bed. The space between two roots, where;

they entered, and which served as a doorway, let in
some light. A reﬂection from the moon threw a dim
light over the entrance. In a corner there was a
jug of water, a loaf of buckwheat bread, and some
chestnuts. I I ‘

They shared the chestnuts; the Marquis added his 25

piece of biscuit; they bit the same loaf of buckwheat

and drank from the jug one after the other.
“ You belong tothis country?” asked the Marquis.
“ I have never been out of it.” I

“Have  ever met you before?” .
“ Often, for I am your own beggar. I Was the poor
man at the foot of the road to your castle. You used to

give me alms. I held out my hand, you saw the hand

the morning to keep me from dying of hunger at night.
» Sometimes a sou saved my life. I owe you my life. I
pay the debt.”
His Voice grew serious. “ On one condition.”
10 “ What is that?”
“ That you do not come here to Work evil.”
“ I come here to do good,” said the Marquis.
" “ Let us sleep,” said the beggar. *

They lay down side by side on the bed of seaweed.

15 The beggar fell asleep immediately. The Marquis, al-
though very tired, remained absorbed-in thought for a
‘time, then he looked at the poor man in the darkness
and lay down again. Lying on this pallet was like
lying on the ground; he took advantage of it to put
20 his ear to the earth and listen. p Therewas a dull hum-
ming underground 5 he heard the noise of the bells.
~ The tocsin was still sounding. a
The Marquis fell asleep.
When he awoke it Was day.

25 Tellmarch, the beggar, was outside near the entrance.

He was leaning on his stick. The sun shone on his
face. i I ’ I

“Monseigneur,” said Tellmarch, “it has just struck
four from the belfry of Tanis. -I heard the four strokes.

+>gs3e<+

So the wind has changed, it is blowing offshore; I
hear no other sound, so the tocsin has ceased. Every-
thing is quiet at the farm and in the hamlet. The
worst of the danger- is over; it will be wise for us to
separate. It is my hour for setting out.” 5
He indicated a point on the horizon.
‘ “ I am going that way.”
He pointed in the opposite direction.
“You must go this way.”

The beggar saluted the Marquis solemnly, 1.0.

A moment later he had disappeared among the trees.
The Marquis rose and went in the direction Tellmarch

9 had pointed out to him. a

It was the charming morning hour, called in the old
Normanpeasant tongue “the song sparrow of the day.” 15

The ﬁnches and hedge sparrows were chirping. The

Marquis followed the path by which they had come the
night before.  
At the foot of the crossroad where he was stealing
along, he could see only the roofs of the farms which 20
lay to the left. He was skirting a steep height. At
the foot of the height the View was abruptly lost in
the trees. The foliage seemed bathed in light. All
nature was ﬁlled with the deep joy of the morning.
Suddenly the landscape became terrible. It was like 25
the bursting forth of an ambuscade. A strange deluge.
of wild cries and gunshots fell over the ﬁelds and
woods full of sunlight, and in the direction of the farm
a great smoke pierced by bright ﬂames arose, as if the q

-‘>884-8+’

hamlet and the farm were nothing but a bundle of

burning straw. It was sudden and fearful, an abrupt
change from peace to madness, a horror without warn-
ing. The Marquis stopped.

There is no one who, under similar circumstances,
would not have felt that curiosity is stronger than

danger; one must know, if he has to die in con-

10

sequence. He climbed up the height, at the foot of
which passed the hollow path. From there he could
see, but he might also be seen. He looked about
him.  

‘To be sure, there was ﬁring and a ﬁre. The noise
could be heard, the ﬁre could be seen. The farm was

the center of some terrible calamity. What was it? .

Was the farm attacked? And by whom? Was it a

battle? The Blues, as they had been ordered, very ,
often punished refractory farms and villages by setting a

them on ﬁre; to make an example of them they burned

every farm and every hamlet which had not felled the A

trees prescribed by law, and which had not opened pas-
sages through the thickets for the republican cavalry.
It was evident that none of the openings ordered by the

decree had been made in the thickets and hedges of  

Tanis. Was this the punishment?

While the Marquis, hesitating to go down, hesitating
to remain, was listening and watching, this din ceased.
The Marquis was aware of something in the thicket
like the scattering of a wild and joyous troop. There

was a frightful swarming under the trees. They were

+>8858<‘-

rushing from the farm into the woods. Drums were
beating. No more ﬁring was heard. They seemed to
be hunting about, pursuing, tracking; it was evident

that they were in search of some one; the noise was ’

scattered and deep; it was a medley of words of anger
and of triumph, a clamorous uproar; suddenly, as an
outline becomes visible in a cloud of smoke, something
became articulate and distinct in this tumult. It was

a name—a name repeated by a thousand voices, and    

the Marquis heard clearly this cry : —
“ Lantenac! Lantenac! the Marquis deLantenac I”
It was he for whom they were hunting.
Suddenly, all around him and on every side at once,
the thicket was ﬁlled with guns, bayonets, and swords,

i p a tricolored ﬂag arose in the shade, the cry of “Lante-

nac ! ” burst on his ear, and at his feet through the
brambles and branches passionate faces appeared.

The Marquis was alone, standing on a summit which
could be seen from every point of the wood. He could
scarcely see those who were crying his name, but he
was seen by all. If there were a thousand guns in
the woods, he was a target for them. He could dis-

10

tinguish nothing in the thicket but eager eyes ﬁxed»

upon him. a  
He took off his hat, turned up the rim, broke a long,
dry thorn from a furze bush, drew a white cockade from
his pocket, fastened the brim and the cockade back to
the crown of the hat with the thorn, and putting the

25

hat on his head again, so that the raised rim showed ,

-*>88.63<*«

his forehead and his cockade, he said in a loud voice,
speaking to the whole forest at once : —
“ I a1n the man you are seeking. I am the Marquis
de Lantenac, Prince of Brittany, Lieutenant-General of
5 the armies of the king. Make an end of it. Aim!
Fire!” M i
And, tearing open his goatskin vest, he bared his
naked breast.

He looked down, expecting to meet loaded guns, and

10 saw himself surrounded with kneeling men.
A great shout arose: “Long live Lantenac! Long.
. live the general!”
At the same time hats were thrown in the air, swords
ﬂourished joyfully, and throughout the whole thicket
15 sticks were seen rising, on whose points Whirled brown
woolen caps.   o   i e
‘ He was surrounded by a_Vendean band. This troop
fell on their knees when they saw him.  
All these eyes, full of a terrible ﬁre, were ﬁxed o
20 the Marquis with a sort of savage love. a

A young, noble-looking, man made his way through  

the kneeling soldiers, and with long strides Went up
towards the Marquis. Like the peasants, he wore a
felt hat with turned-up rim and a white cockade, and

25 was wrapped in a fur jacket, but his hands were.  

white and his linen ﬁne, and he wore over his vest

a white silk scarf, from which hung a sword with a
gold hilt. a

When he reached the height he threw down his hat,

~>8878<‘-

unfastened his scarf, knelt on one knee, and presented
scarf and sword to the Marquis, saying :—

“ We Were searching for you, and We have found you.
Accept the sword of command. These men are now
yours. I was their commander; I am promoted to a 5
higher rank, for I become your soldier. Accept our
homage, my lord. General, give me your orders.”

RALPH WALDO EMERSON.

RALPH WALDO EMERSON was born in Boston on the
25th of May, 1803. His father, William Emerson, was
aminister. The parsonage was on Summer Street, Where
at that time Were many pretty homes With gardens.
5 Mr. Emerson took great interest in the education of

his children, and Ralph was sent to a private school
before he was three years
old. His father died dur-
ing his early boyhood, and
his mother Worked hard
to support and educate
her ﬁve sons.

The boys were very
fond of their books and
were manly and helpful,
 doing all they could for
their mother. Their aunt,
Mary Emerson, lived with

» ,» them, and she guided their
20 choice of reading and led them to think. “Lift your
aims”; “Always do What you are afraid to do”;

“Scorn triﬂes” were the maxims Which she gave to

her nephews.

Ralph entered the Latin School when he Was ten

25 years old, remaining there until he entered college. His
books Were his chief source of happiness, and the scenes
in them were so real to him and his brothers that when

.»as9»3<~ 

they visited their grandmother at Concord, they imag-
ihed in their play that the barns, garret,or woods were
battleﬁelds or mountain-tops.

Many were the poems which they could repeat, and
a clerk in one of the Concord stores used to stand little
Ralph on a barrel so that he might entertain the cus-
tomers with his recitations.

Each of the boys was ﬁtted for college, and helped
pay his own expenses by teaching and acting as usher
or waiter. Ralph entered Harvard College when he was
but fourteen. He occupied a room at the President’s

_ house, and paid for it by carrying ofﬁcial messages.

He won ﬁve dollars at the prize declamations and sent
the money home, hoping that it would enable his mother
to purchase a new shawl, but it was needed to pay a
debt.

‘ Ralph was graduated when he was eighteen, and was
chosen class poet. He and his brother William, two
years his senior, opened a school for young ladies in
Mrs. Emerson’s house. It was fairly successful, but as
soon as they were well established, William went to
Germany and left Ralph in charge. . He taught during
more than a year, and then entered the Divinity School
at Harvard College.

Within a month his health failed, and he was obliged
to give up his studies. He went to visit an uncle at
Newton, spending much of his time out of doors.

He remained there three months, and then left on account

of ill—health. In the spring he took a school at Cam-
bridge, in order to be where he might gain some benefit
from the Divinity School, and in October of this year,
1826, he was “ approbated to preach.”

5 His health, however, had so failed that his physician  

ordered him to go south. He traveled as far as St.

.Augustine, and the next summer returned home, im-
proved in health, but not fully recovered.

He was married, soon after his return, to Ellen

10 Tucker, a very beautiful young lady, but of delicate

health. She died a year and a half after her marriage.

Mr. Emerson was for a time the pastor of a church E

in Boston. He then sailed for Europe, desiring to see
the ancient cities and to make the acquaintance of
15 some of the men whose works had inﬂuenced him,
among them being Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Carlyle.

He found the latter among the lonely hills of Niths—'

dale, and the two philosophers formed a friendship
which lasted throughout their lives.

 20 On Emerson’s return to this country he engaged in

lecturing, and preached at Plymouth during that winter.
There he met Lydia Jackson, to whom he was married
the following September. Mr. Emerson tookhis bride
to their new home in Concord, where he lived the rest
25 of his life, and which is still occupied by thefamily.
He spent much of his time out of doors; and the grove

near by, rather than his library, was“ used by him as a .

study. He believed that his thoughts were clearer and
t‘ru_er in thigs solitude, with only the winds and the voices

*>891B<+

of birds to distract him. He found inspiration in the
stars at night and even braved the w_i__nd storms, revel-

  ing intheir grandeur.

Friends gathered in Concord, among them Hawthorne,
Thoreau, Alcott, and the Curtis boys, while near by were
Longfellow, Holmes, and _Lowell. Their society afforded
him much pleas-
ure. Emerson was
also a favorite
among the village
farmers, and the
little children 
loved him dearly.  

Much of his time  
was Spent in lectur-    ‘
ing. He received
but little from his
books of “Essays,” “Poems,” “Representative Men,”
and other works until the latter years of his life. In
his seventieth year he went abroad for the third time,
revisiting his old friend Carlyle. On his return to
Concord the whole village Welcomed him, and his
friends and neighbors accompanied him to his home,
under a triumphal arch.

His last few years were quiet and peaceful. He
died on the 27th of April, 1882, and was buried under
a great pine tree in Sleepy Hollow cemetery. "

EACH AND ALL.
RALPH WALDO EMERSON.

LITTLE thinks, in the ﬁeld, yon red-cloaked clown,
Of thee, from the hilltop looking down 3

The heifer that lows in the upland farm,
Far—heard, lows not thine ear to charm ;

The sexton, tolling his bell at noon

Deems not that great Napoleon

Stops his horse, and lists with delight

Whilst his ﬁles sweep round yon Alpine height ;
Nor knowest thou what argument ‘
Thy life to thy neighbor’s creed has lent.

All are needed by each one —

_ Nothing is fair or good alone.

I thought the sparrow’s note from heaven,
Singing at dawn on the alder-bough ;

I brought him.home, in his nest, at even;
He sings the song, but it pleases not now;
For I did not bring home the river andsky;
He sang to my ear——they sang to my eye.

The delicate shells lay on the shore;
The bubbles ofthe latest wave
Fresh pearls to their enamel gave,
And the bellowing of the savage sea
Greeted their safe escape to me.

-—>8933<*

I wiped away the Weeds and foam -

I fetched my sea—born treasures home;
But the poor, unsightly, noisome things
Had left their beauty on the /shore,

With the sun, and the sand, and the Wild uproar.

Then I said : “ I covet truth;

Beauty is unripe childhood’s cheat;

I leave it behind with the games of youth.”-—
As I spoke, beneath my feet L
The ground-pine curled its pretty wreath,
Running over the club-moss burrs;

I inhaled the Violet’s breath;

Around me stood the oaks and ﬁrs;
Pine—cones and acorns lay on the ground;
Over me scared the eternal sky,

Full of light and of deity;

Again I saw, again I heard

The rolling river, the morning bird ;—
Beauty through my senses stole——-

I yielded myself to the perfect Whole.

EYES.
RALPH WALDO EMERSON.

MAN cannot ﬁx his eye on the sun, and sofar seems
imperfect. In Siberia a late traveler found men who

" could see the satellites of Jupiter with their unaided eye.

In some respects the animals excel us. The birds have
a longer sight, besides the advantage by their wings of
a higher observatory. A cow canbid her calf, by secret

signal, probably of the eye, to run away, or to lie down  

and hide itself. The jockeys say of certain horses, that
“they look over the whole ground.” The outdoor life
and hunting and labor give equal vigor to the human
eye. A farmer looks out at you as strong as the horse ;
his eye—beam is like the stroke of a staff. An eye can

‘threaten like a loaded and leveled gun, or can insult

like hissing or kicking ; or, in its altered mood, by beams
of kindness, it can make the heart dance with joy.

The eye obeys exactly the action of the mind.
When a thought strikes us, the eyes ﬁx, and remain
gazing at a distance; in enumerating the names of
persons or. of countries, as France, Germany, Spain,
Turkey, the eyes wink at each new name. There is
no nicety of learning sought by the mind, which the
eyes do not vie in acquiring. “An artist,” says
Michael Angelo, “ must have his measuring tools, not
in the hand, but in the eye”; and there is no end to
the catalogue of its performances.

‘ dissembled by the lips!

-98953“

Eyes are bold as lions——roving, running, leaping,
here and there, far and near. They speak all languages.
They wait for no introduction; . . . ask no leave of age
or rank; they respect neither poverty nor riches, nei-
ther learning nor power, . .i . but intrude, and come
again, and go through and through you, in a moment
of time. . . . The glance is natural magic. The myste-
rious communication established across a house between
two entire strangers moves all the springs of wonder.

The communication by the glance is in the greatest

part not subject to the control of the will. It is the
bodily symbol of identity of nature. We look into
the eyes to know if this other form is another self, and
the eyes will not lie, but make a faithful confession
what inhabitant is there. . . .

The eyes of umen converse as much as their tongues,

 with the advantage that the ocular dialect needs no

dictionary, but is understood all the world over.
When the eyes say one thing, and the tongue another,
a practised man relies on the language of the ﬁrst.
If the man is off his centre, the eyes show it. You
canread in the eyes of your companion whether your

. argument hits him, though his tongue will not confess

it. i There is a look by which a man shows he is going
to say a good thing, and a look when he has saidit.
Vain and forgotten are all the ﬁne offers and oﬂices of
hospitality if there is nolholiday in the eye. How
many furtive inclinations avowed by the eye, though

pany in which it may easily happen he has said
nothing, and no important remark has been addressed
to him, and yet, if in sympathy with the society, he
shall not have a sense of this fact, such a stream of life
has been ﬂowing into him, and out from him, through
the eyes. There are eyes, to be sure, that give no

.more admission into the man than blueberries. Others

are liquid and deep —-— wells that a man may fall into ;
others are aggressive and devouring, seem to call out
the police, take all too much notice, and require

crowded Broadways, and the security of millions, to

protect individuals against them. i. . . There are asking
eyes, asserting eyes, prowling eyes; and eyes full of
fate—some of good and some of sinister omen. The
alleged power to charm down insanity, or ferocity in
beasts, is a power behind the eye. It must be a
victory achieved in the will, before it -can be signiﬁed
in the eye. i

THE PERCEPTION OF BEAUTY.
WILLIAM ELLERY C-HANNING.

BEAUTY is an all-pervading presence. It unfolds in
the numberless ﬂowers of thespring. It waves in the
branches of the trees and the green blades of grass. It
haunts the depths of the earth and sea, and gleams out
in the hues of the shell and the precious stone. And

not only these minute objects, but the ocean, the moun-

tains, the clouds, the heavens, the stars, the rising and
setting sun, all overﬂow with beauty. The universe is

’ its temple, and those men who are alive to it cannot

lift their eyes without feeling themselves encompassed
with it on every side. i ,

_Now this beauty is so precious, the enjoyments it
gives are so reﬁned and pure, so congenial with our
tenderest feelings, and so akin to worship, that it is
painful to think of the multitude of men as living in
the midst of it, and living almost as blind to it as if
they were tenants of a dungeon. An inﬁnite joy is lost
to the world by the want of culture of this spiritual
endowment.
linked with beauty, and they win their way most surely
and deeply into the soul when arrayed in this their
natural and ﬁt attire. Now no man receives the true
culture of a man,’ in whom the sensibility to the beau-
tiful is not cherished; and I know of no condition _of
life from which it should be excluded. '

LOST ON THE MOUNTAIN.
BERN ARDIN DE ST. PIERRE.

BERNARDIN DE ST. PIERRE was born at.Havre, lllrance, in
1737. .
He was very fond of nature, books, and animals, but cared lit-

‘ . tle for other companionship. At twelve years of age he became

absorbed in the adventures of “Robinson Crusoe.” To ‘please
the boy his parents allowed him to take a sea voyage with his
uncle. . i

T On his return he studied at Caen, where he made great prog-
ress. He completed his studies at Rome, and soon after was
granted a commission as an engineer. He was then sent to
Dusseldorf, and might have attained honor and a fortune, but he

had a faulty temper and was unwilling to obey orders, so that in‘

spite of his bravery and talents he was sent back to France.

After years of changes and trouble he went to Paris and
devoted himself to literature.

His “Paul and Virginia” is one of the most beautiful stories
ever written, and has been translated into many languages. It
is said that Napoleon slept with "a copy of this book beneath
his pillow during his Italian campaign, and Joseph Bonaparte
awarded a pension of six thousand francs tothe author.

St. Pierre was elected a member of the French Academy as a
mark of honor, and his last years were happier than his youth
had ever been. He died at the age of seventy-seven.

ONE Sunday, at daybreak, the children perceived a
negro Woman beneath the plantains which surrounded

their habitation- She threw herself at the feet of

Virginia and said: ,“ My good young lady, have pity
on a poor runaway slave. For a whole month I have
wandered among these mountains, half dead with hun-

ger and often pursued by the hunters and their dogs.

I ﬂed from my master, a rich planter of the Black,

River, who has used me as you see”; and she showed
her body marked with scars from the lashes she had
received. She added: “I was going to drown myself,
but hearing you lived here, I said to myself: Since
there are still some good White people in this country,
I need not die yet.” S

Virginia answered with emotion: “ Take courage,  

unfortunate creature! here is something to eat”; and
she gave her the breakfast she had been preparing,
When
her hunger was appeased, Virginia said to her: “ Poor
woman! I should like to go and ask forgiveness for
you of your master. Surely the sight of you’ will
Will you show me the way ? ”

 “ Angel of heaven ! ” answered the poor negro woman,
“ I will follow you where you please I ” Virginia called
her brother and begged himto accompany her. The

«slave led the way, by winding and difﬁcult paths, until,

about the middle of the day, they reached the borders
of the Black River.
house, surrounded by extensive plantations, and a num-
ber of slaves employed in their Various labors. Their
master was walking among them with a pipe in his

There they perceived a well-built r

mouth and a switch in his hand. Virginia, holding  

Paul by the hand, drew near, and with much emotion
begged him, for the love of God, to pardon his poor
slave, who stood trembling, a few paces behind.

10

»>a1oo8<~

The planter at ﬁrst paid little attentionto the chil-
dren, but when he observed the elegance of Virginia’s
form and the profusion of her beautiful light tresses
which had escaped from beneath her blue cap; when
he heard the soft tone of her voice which trembled,

as well as her whole frame,.while she implored his V
‘compassion,——he took his pipe from his mouth, and,

lifting up his stick, said that he pardoned his slave,
for the love of her who asked his forgiveness. Vir-
ginia made a sign to the slave to approach her master,
and instantly sprang away, followed by Paul.

They climbed up the steep they had descended, and,

‘ having gained the summit, seated themselves at the

20

25

foot of a tree, overcome with fatigue, hunger, and thirst.
Paul said to Virginia: “My dear sister, it is past’ noon,
and I am sure you are thirsty and hungry; we shall
ﬁnd no dinner here; let us go down themountain
again and ask the master of the poor slave for some
food.”—“ Oh, no,” answered Virginia, “he frightens
me too much. Remember wha_t mamma sometimes
says, ‘The bread of thewicked is like stones in the
mouth.’

food?’ .
Scarcely had she pronounced these words when they
heard the noise of water falling from a neighboring

‘ rock. Theyvran thither, and having quenched their

thirst at this crystal spring, they gathered and ate a

few cresses which grew on the border of the stream.

Soon afterwards, while they were wandering backwards
and forwards in search of more solid nourishment, Vir-
ginia perceived in the thickest part of the forest a
young palm tree. The kind of cabbage which is found
at the top of “the palm, enfolded within its leaves, is
well adapted for food; but although the stock of the
tree is not thicker than a man’s leg, it grows to above
sixty feet in height. The wood of the tree, indeed, is

composed only of very ﬁne ﬁlaments; but the bark is u

so hard that it turns the edge of the hatchet, and Paul
was not furnished even with a knife.

At length he thought of setting ﬁre to the palm tree,
but a new difﬁculty occurred; he had no steel with

i which to strike ﬁre; and although the whole island is

covered with rocks, I do not believe it is possible to
ﬁnd a single ﬂint. Paul determined to kindle a ﬁre
after the manner of the negroes. With thesharp end
of a stone he made a small hole in the branch of a tree
that was quite dry, and which he held between his
feet; he then, with the edge of the same stone, brought
to a point another dry branch of a different sort of
wood, placing the piece of pointed wood in the small
hole of the branch which he held with his feet and
turning it rapidly between his hands. In a few minutes
smoke and sparks of ﬁre issued from the point of
Paul then heaped together dried grass and
branches, and set ﬁre to the foot of the palm tree,

and to rest himself by her side. Virginia then said to
him: “My dear brother, the sun is going down; you
have still some strength left, but mine has quite failed;
do leave me here and return home alone to ease the
fears of our mothers.” —“ Oh, no,” said Paul, “I will
not leave you; if night overtakes us in this Wood, I
will light a ﬁre and bring down another palm tree;

you shall eat the cabbage, and I will form a covering p
‘ of the leaves to shelter you.” s

10

In the mean time Virginia being a little rested, she _

_ gathered from the trunk of an old tree, which overhung

the bank of the river, some long leaves of the plant
called hart’s—tongue, which grew near its root. Of
these leaves she made a sort of buskin, "with which she
covered her feet which were bleeding from the sharp-

ness of the stony paths; for in her eager desire to do

good she had forgotten to put on her shoes. Feeling
her feet cooled by the freshness of the leaves, she

‘broke off a branch of bamboo and continued her walk,
leaning with one hand on the staff, and with the other

on Paul. _
They walked slowly through the woods; but from

i the height of the trees, and the thickness of their

foliage, they soon lost sight of the mountain by which
they hadhitherto directed their course, and also of the
sun, which was, now setting. At length they wan-
dered from the beaten path in which they had hitherto

15

25.

Walked, and found themselves in a labyrinth of trees,

——>810‘l-84+

underwood, and rocks, whence there appeared to be no
outlet.

Paul made Virginia sit down, while he ran back-
wards and forwards, half frantic, in search of a path

3 which might lead them out of this thick wood; but

he fatigued himself to no purpose. He then climbed

to the top of_a lofty tree, whence he hoped at least to

perceive the mountain; but he could discern nothing

around him but the tops of trees, some of which were '

gilded with the last beams of the setting sun. The
most profound silence reigned in those awful solitudes,
which was only interrupted by the cry of the deer
which came to their lairs in that unfrequented spot.
Paul, in the hope that some hunter would hear his voice,
called out as loud as he was able: “Come, come to
the help of Virginia!” But the echoes of the forest
alone answered his call, and repeated again and again,
“ Virginia — Virginia I ” «

Paul at length descended from the tree, overcome by
fatigue and vexation. He looked around in order to

make some arrangement for passing the night in that  

desert; but he could ﬁnd neither fountain, nor palm

tree, nor even a branch of dry wood ﬁt for kindling a

ﬁre. He was then impressed, by experience, with the
sense of his own weakness and began to weep. Vir-
ginia said to him: “Do not weep, my dear brother,
or I shall be overwhelmed with grief. I am the cause
of all your sorrow and of all that our mothers are suf-

fering at this moment. I ﬁnd we ought to do nothing,

not even good, without consulting our parents. Oh, I
have been veryimprudent! ”—and she began to shed
tears. ‘f Let us‘ pray to ‘God, my sV:..dega,r brother,” she
again said, “ and he will hear us.” They had scarcely
ﬁnished their prayer when they heard the barking of
a dog. “It must be the dog of some hunter,” said

 Paul, “ who comes here at night, to lie in wait forthe
”jd,eer.” Soon after, the dog began barking again with

increased violence. ,
“ Surely,” said Virginia, “it is Fidele, our own dog.
Yes; now I know his bark.” A moment after Fidele

_ was at their feet, barking, howling, moaning, and

devouring them with caresses. Before they could
recover from their surprise, they saw Domingo running
towards them. At the sight of the good old negro
who wept for joy, they began to weep too.

I When Domingo" had recovered himself a little, “ Oh,
my dear children,” said be, “how miserable have you

wards and forwards.inthe plantation, not knowing where
to look for you. At last I took some of your old clothes,
and showingthem to Fidele, the poor animal, as if he
understood me, immediately began to scent your path,
and conducted me, wagging his tail all the while, to
the Black River. ,

“ I there saw a planter who told me. you had brought
back a Maroon negro woman, his slave, and that he

still on the scent, led me up the steep bank of the Black
River, where he again stopped and barked with all his
might. At last he led me to this very spot. We
are now at the foot of the mountain and still four

5 good leagues from home. Come, eat and recover your
strength.” i '

Domingo then presented them With a cake, some
fruit, and a largegourd full of beverage. But when
they prepared to continue their journey a new diﬂiculty

10 occurred; Paul and Virginia could no longer walk,
their feet being swollen and inﬂamed. Domingo knew
f not what to do; whether to leave them and go in search
of help,.or remain and pass the night with them on
that spot. “There was a time,” said he, “when I

15 could carry you both together in my arms! . But now

you are grown big, and I am old.”   ,  
‘ While he was in this perplexity, a troop of Maroon
negroes appeared at a short distance from them. The
chief of the band, approaching Paul and Virginia, said
20 to them: “Good little white people, do not be afraid.
We saw you pass this morning with a negro woman of
the Black River. You went to ask pardon for her of
her wicked master; and we, in return for this, will
carry you home upon our shoulders.” He then made
25 a sign, and four of the strongest negroes immediately

formeda sort of litter with the branches of trees and V

lianas, and having ‘seated Paul and Virginia on it, car-
ried them upon their shoulders. Domingo marched in

front withehis lighted torch, and they proceeded amidst

-—>81078<-

the rejoicings of the whole troop, who overwhelmed
them with their benedictions. i y _

It was midnight when they arrived at the foot of
their mountain, on the ridges of which several ﬁres
were lighted. As soon as they began to ascend, they
heard voices exclaimingz “Is it you, my children?”
They answered immediately, and the negroes also:
“Yes, yes, it is.” A moment after they could distin-
guish their mothers coming towards them with lighted
torches in their hands.” “Unhappy children!” cried
Madame de la Tour, “where have you been? what
agonies you have made us suffer! ”—“We have been,”
said Virginia, “ to the Black River, where we went to

T ask pardon for a poor Maroon slave, to whom I gave

our breakfast this morning, because she seemed dying
of hunger ; and these Maroon negroes have brought us
home.” Madame de la Tour embraced her daughter,
without being able to speak 3 and Virginia, who felt
her face wet with her mother’s tears, exclaimed: “ Now
I am repaid for all the hardships I have suffered.”   Mar-
garet, in a transport of delight, pressed Paul in her arms,
exclaiming: “And you also, my dear child, you have done
a good action.” When they reached the cottages with
their children,they entertained all the negroes with a
plentiful repast, after which the latter returned to the

OLIVER GOLDSMITH.

OLIVER GOLDSMITH was born in 1728, in a little Irish

hamlet called Pallas. A His father was a clergyman, who
found it hard to provide for his large family of eight
children. When Oliver was two years old, his father
s   was offered a place
as curate at Lis-
soy, and the fam-
ily moved to a
large house near
that village.

A s e r v a n t,
named Elizabeth
Delop, taught the
alphabet to little
Oliver, and he was
afterwards sent to

His teacher was an

old quartermaster
' named Thomas
Byrne, who used to shoulder a crutch and show the boys
“how ﬁelds" were won.” He told the children Irish folk-
stories and wild legends and sang them many a song.

the village school. L

While at this school, Oliver was taken ill with

25 smallpox, and was sent, on recovering, to the Griffin
school at Roscommon. The pale-faced little fellow
learned very slowly and was looked upon as a dunce.

+>g109§<«

  ‘The boys laughed at him and imposed upon him,  
‘although they all regarded him as kind-hearted and
T affectionate. T

Oliver was no dunce, though he seemed so stupid‘

and awkward. After he became famous, these very

5 .

playmates remembered bright answers he had given -

when they had roused him beyond endurance. While
attending school at Roscommon, Oliver stayed with his
Uncle John.
house. The gay music led Oliver to forget his shyness,
and he began to dance the hornpipe. The ﬁddler
laughed and called him “ Ugly Alsop.” Oliver quickly
turned to him and said :— 1

“ Heralds, proclaim aloud! all saying,
See Esop dancing and his monkey playing.”

In spite of these ﬂashes of wit, his playmates continued
to laugh at him and cheat him into buying their worth-
less toys, and he was thought to be the dullest boy in
the village.

At the age of eleven he was sent to a school at Athlone,

about ﬁve miles away, and two years later attended a
school at Edgeworthstown. The master, Rev. Patrick
Hughes, took an interest in the lad, and was the only
teacher who recognized his good qualities.   T

The story is told that Oliver was returningto school
after a holiday, riding a horse and carrying a guinea in his
pocket. He loitered alongthe way, enjoying the scenes,
and at nightfall found himself several miles from school.

THE importance of learning to love what is best to read is
hardly second to the art of reading. During childhood the
imagination is most active, and this is the period when the
mind should become familiar with the choicest gems of thought
and expression.

The seeds sown in early life must bear fruit in later years.

Long before the child can deﬁne an author’s meaning the spirit

of the thought has reached his heart.
. It is With this ﬁrm conviction, based upon schoolroom experi-
ence, that the author of this series has gradually led her readers

The guinea gave him such a sense of Wealth that he
inquired the way to the best house in the village, mean-
ing the best inn. The man of Whom he inquired Was
amused at the boy’s importance, and directed him to the
home of Squire Featherstone. Oliver rang at the gate,
gave his orders to the servant,and called for a supper
‘ The squire, seeing
his mistake, carried on the joke, and it was not until
Oliver produced the guinea to settle his account that
he learned the truth. T T

He afterwards Wrote a play, which has such an inci-

-dent for its foundation.

In his seventeenth year Oliver Went   to Trinity Col-
lege, Dublin, entering as a “sizar,” a name given to
those students Who were educated at little expense but
Were obligedto act as servants. Heswept the courts

and after he became famous it Was found that he had
scrawled his name upon one of the windows.

The unhappy sizar little thought that some day this
pane of glass would be given a place of honor in the
College Library._

Poor Oliver led an unhappy life. He cared little for
study and had a brutal tutor. A year and a half after
he entered college his father died and he was in Want.

Music afforded him his only delight, and he loved
to play upon his ﬂute and sing. Iie Wrote street bal-

the singing of these ballads by the street beggars.

He was so kind-hearted that he seldom reached home

Would touch his tender heart,and he often robbed him-
self of his clothing that he might cover some shivering
form. p  
When he was twenty—one, Goldsmith received the
degree of Bachelor of Arts and returned to his home.
There he spent a happy period of two years, helping
his brother, who taught the village school, and assisting
his widowed mother.

After trying a number of professions without success,
Goldsmith decided to emigrate to America. He started
with thirty pounds and mounted on a good horse, In
six weeks he returned, riding a forlorn-looking beast.
He said that he had reached a seaport and paid his pas-
sage to America, but that the winds were unfavorable,
and while waiting he had taken a little trip into the
country. During his absence a fair wind had arisen

and the ship had sailed without him.

Goldsmith thendecided to study law. Mr. Contarine,
an uncle, lent him ﬁfty pounds, and he set out for Lon-
don.
who persuaded him to try his luck at doubling his
money at a card table, and he lost it-all.

Mr. Contarine did not entirely lose faith in his way-

chemistry, gave him the means to start the study of

reduced to a life among the beggars.

tried to open apractice in London, but had few patients,

grew in favor. He made the acquaintance of Dr. John-
son, one of the greatest English Writers; Reynolds, a
famous English painter; and Edmund Burke, a dis-
tinguished orator.   E
Goldsmith left the garret at the top of “ Breakneck
Steps” and took rooms in a better locality; but he
Was constantly in debt. At one time hewas arrested

for help. The good doctor sent him a guinea and soon
followed the messenger. He found that Goldsmith

had changed the guinea, bought a bottle of wine, and A

was upbraiding the landlady. Dr. Johnson put the cork
5 into the bottle, and told Goldsmith to think of some
way out of his difﬁculty. r .

’ G Goldsmith told him that he had a novel all ready for
the press. Johnson read it, saw that it was good, and
carrying it to a bookseller, sold it for sixty pounds.

10 The debt was paid and the sheriff’sofﬁcer withdrew.
The novel that acted as rescuer was “The Vicar of
Wakeﬁeld.” Before it was published, however, “The
Traveler ” appeared. This ‘poem, which was the first
work to which Goldsmith had signed his name, received

a 15 highest praise from the critics.

“ The Vicar of Wakeﬁeld” was published when

. ‘Goldsmith was thirty—eight years of age. Few books
have been more popular. The story sparkles with wit,
and the fresh home life appeals to every one.

20 “ The Deserted Village,” a picture of simple, village
life, was published four years‘ later. Even Goldsmith’s
enemies had nothing to say to the praise which greeted
this poem. , G

He wrote a play called “She Stoops to Conquer,”-

25 and after some difficulty found a manager who was
willing to put it upon the stage. It was received with
enthusiasm, and is still popular. . .

The last years of his life were attended with success,

but his extravagant way of living, and readiness to

respond to the call of every needy person, kept him

always in debt. , ’, .  

Goldsmith died in 1774, in his forty-sixth year. His l
grave has been forgotten, but he has been honored
with a monument in VVestminster Abbey, bearing an 5
inscription written by his friend, Dr. Johnson.

MOSES AT THE FAIR.
[ABRIDGED.]

OLIVER GOLDSMITH.

As we were now to hold up our heads a little higher

i in the world, it would beproper to sell the colt, which

was grown old," at a neighboring fair, andbuy us a.
horse that would carry single or double upon an occa- 10
sion and make a pretty appearance at church or upon

a Visit.

As the fair happened on the following day, I had
intentions of going myself; but my wife persuaded me
that I had a cold, and nothing could prevail upon her 15
to permit me from home. “ No, my dear,” said she,

“ our son Moses is a discreet boy and can buy and“
sell to very good ‘advantage ; you know all our great
bargains are of his purchasing. He always stands

out and higgles, and actually tires them till he gets 20 _

a bargain." .

10

->31163<<—

As I had some opinion of my son’s prudence, I was
willing enough to intrust him with this commission;
and the next morning I perceived his sisters busy in
ﬁtting out Moses for the fair, trimming his hair, brush-
ing his buckles, and cooking his hat with pins... The
business of the toilet being over, we had at last the

satisfaction of seeing him mounted upon the colt, with

a deal box before him to bring home groceries in. He
had on a coat made of that cloth they call thunder and
lightning, Which, though grown too short, was much

too good to be thrown away. His waistcoat was of

gosling green, and his sisters had tied his hair with
a broad, black ribbon. We all followed him several
paces from the door, bawling after him,“ Good luck!
good luck‘! ” till we could see him no longer.

He was scarce gone when Mr. Thornhill’s butler came
to congratulate us upon our good fortune, saying that

he overheard his young master mention our names with

great commendation. a

Good fortune seemed resolved not to come alone.
Another footman from the same family followed, with
a card for my daughters, importing that the two
ladies had received such pleasing accounts from Mr.
Thornhill of us all, that after a few previous inquiries
they hoped tobe perfectly satisﬁed. “ Ay,” cried my
wife, “I now see it is no easy matter to get into the
families of the great; but when one once gets in, then,
as Moses says, one may go to sleep.” To this piece

‘of’ humor, for she intended it for wit, my daughters

.,g117g<.—

assented with a loud laugh of pleasure. In short, such

was her satisfaction at this message that a she actually

put her hand in her pocket and gave the messenger
sevenpence halfpenny. .

This was to be our visiting day. The next that
came was Mr. Burchell, who had been at the fair. He
brought my little ones a pennyworth of gingerbread
each, which my wife undertook to keep for them and

give themby little at a time. He brought my daughters  

also a couple of boxes, in which they might keep wafers,
snuff, patches, or even money, when they got it.
wife was unusually fond of a weasel-skin purse, as being
the most lucky; but this by the by.

I wondered what could keep our son so long at the
fair, as it was -now almost nightfall. “ Never mind

  our son,” cried my wife; “ depend upon it ‘he knows

what he is about. .I’l1 warrant we ’l1 never see him

such bargains as would amaze one. But, as I live,
yonder comes Moses, without a horse, and the box at
his back.” .

As she spoke, Moses came slowly on foot, and sweat-
ing under the deal box, which he had strapped round
his shoulders like a peddler.
Moses; well, my boy, what have you brought us from
the fair? ”— “ I have brought you myself,” cried Moses
with a sly look and resting the box on the dresser.-—
“Ah, Moses,” cried my wife, “that we know, but

where is the horse?” —“I have sold him,” cried

—“ Well done, my good boy,” returned she; “ I knew‘
.you would touch them off. Between ourselves, three

pounds ﬁve shillings and twopence is no «bad day’s
work. Come, let us have it, then.” — “ I have brought
back no money,” cried Moses again. “I have laid it

all out in a bargain, and here it is,” pulling out abun-

dle from his breast; “here they are, a gross of green
spectacles with silver rims and shagreen cases.” —-g
“A gross of green spectacles!” repeated my wife in a
faint voice. “ And you have parted with the colt and
brought us back nothing but a gross of paltry, green
spectacles!”——“ Dear mother,” cried the boy, “why
won’t you listen to reason?
gain or I should not have bought them. p Thesilver
rimsalone will sell for double the money.”—“A ﬁg
for the silver rims I ” cried my wife. “ I dare say they
won’t sell for above half the money at the rate of
broken silver, ﬁve shillings an ounce.”—“ You need
be under no uneasiness,” cried I, “about selling the
rims. They are not worth sixpence, for I perceive
they are only copper varnished over.”—“ What!”
cried my wife, “not silver! the rims not silver!”

“No,” cried I, “no more silver than your saucepan.”
4“ And so,” returned she, “ we have parted with the

colt, and have only a gross of green spectacles with _
copper rims and shagreen cases! The blockhead has ‘

been imposed upon, and should have known his com-

pany better.”e——“ There, my dear,”cried I, “you are

wrong; he should not have known them at all.”+-
“The idiot!” returned she, “to bring me such stuff!
If I had them I would throw them into the ﬁre.” —’

J “There again you are wrong, my dear,” said I, “for
. though they be copper we will keep them by us, as 5

copper spectacles, you know, are better than nothing.”
By this time the unfortunate Moses was undeceived.
He now saw that he had indeed been imposedupon
by a prowling sharper, who had marked him for an
easy prey. I, therefore, asked the circumstances of 10
hisdeception. He sold the horse, it seems, and walked p
the fair in search of another. A reverend looking man
brought him to a tent under pretense of having one to
sell. “ Here,” continued Moses, “ we met another man,
Very well dressed, who desired to borrow twenty pounds 15
upon these, saying that he wanted money, and would
dispose of them for a third of the value. The ﬁrst

“gentleman, who pretended to be my friend’, whispered

to me to buy them, and cautioned me not to let so good
an offer pass. I sent for Mr. Flamborough, and they 20

THE VILLAGE PREACHER.
OLIVER GOLDSMITH.

SWEET was the sound, when oft, at evening’s close,
Up yonder hill the village murmur rose;

There, as I pass’d with careless steps and slow,

The mingling notbs came soften’d from below;
The swain respondive as the milkmaid sung, , -
The sober herd thalt low’d to meet their young;
The noisy geese that gabbled o’er the pool,
The playful children just let loose from school;

The watch-dog’s voice that bay’d the whispering wind,

And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind;
These all in sweet confusion sought thewshade,
And ﬁl1’d each pause the nightingale had made.

But now the sounds of population fail,
N o cheerful murmurs ﬂuct1;_a_te in the gale,
No busy steps the grass-grown foot—way tread,
But all the bloomy ﬂush of life is ﬂed,—
All but yon widow’d, solitary thing,

That feebly bends beside the plashy spring:

She, wretched matron, forced in age, for bread,
To strip the brook with mantling cresses spread,
To pick her wintry fagot from the thorn,

To seek her nightly shed, and weep till morn;
She only left of all the harmless train,

The sad historian of the pensive plain.

Near yonder copse, where once the garden smiled,
And still where many a garden-ﬂower grows wild;
There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,
The village preacher’s modest mansion rose.

A man he wasto allthe country dear,

And passing rich with forty pounds a year ;

Remote from townshe ran his godly race, .
Nor e’er had changed, nor wish’d to change his place;
Unskilful he to fawn, or seek for power

4 By doctrines fashion’d to the Varying hour;

Far other aims his heart had learn’d to prize,
More bent to raise the wretched than to rise.

His house was known to all the Vagrant train,
He chid their wanderings, but relievedbtheir pain;
The long re1ne1nber’d beggar was his guest,
Whose beard descending swept his aged breast.
The ruin’d spendthrift, now no longer proud,
Claim’d kindred there, and had his claims allow’d;
The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,

Sat by his ﬁre, and talk’d the night away;
Wept e’er his wounds, or tales of sorrow done,

Shoulder’d his crutch, and show’d how ﬁelds were won.

Pleased with his guests, the good; man 1earn’d to
glow, 1* 4
And quite forgotitheir Vices in their woe;  
Carelesstheir merits or their faults to scan,
His pity gave ere charity began.

4.3122 34;

Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,
And e’en his failings lean’d to Virtue’s side:
But in his duty prompt at every call,

He watch’d and wept, he pray’d and felt for all,
And, as a bird each fond endearment tries,

To tempt its new-ﬂedged offspring to the skies,
He tried each art, reproved each dull delay,
Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way.

At church, with meek and unaffected grace,
His looks adorn’d the venerable place ;   H

Truth from his lipsrpreviailldi with double sway,

And fools, who came to scoff, remain’d to pray.

The service past, around the pious man,

With steady zeal, each honest rustic ran;

E’en children follow’d with endearing wile,

And pluck’d his gown, to share the good man’s smile.

His ready smile a parent’s warmth eXpress’d, i
Their welfare pleased him, and their cares distress’d;
To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,
But all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven.

As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,  
Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread
Eternal sunshine settles on its head.

.;CASTLES IN SPAIN.
GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS.—

GEORGE VVILLIAM CURTIS was born at Providence, R. I., on
the 24thof February, 1824. He received his early education at
Jamaica Plain, Mass. C ~

The Curtis family went to New York City when George was
ﬁfteen years old, and he spent a year in the counting oﬁice of a
merchant.   1 V

Three years later George and his brother went to Brook
Farm, in West Roxbury, l\/.[ass., where some literary men had
formed a community. They spent
two years there, studying, and en-
joying the Outdoor life.

After a winter at home they went
to Concord, working on a farm half
the day, and spending the remaining
hoursin study. Mr. Curtis recalled

“The soft, sunny spring in the
silent Concord meadows, where I sat
in the great, cool barn through the
long, still, golden afternoons and

He had already become acquainted with Mr. Emerson, and
became a member of a club where he met Hawthorne, Thoreau,
and Alcott. It was at this time that Thoreau built his hut, and
the Curtis brothers helped to raise it. 4

Mr. Curtis sailed for Europe in 1846, and spent four years in
traveling about Italy, France, Germany, and Palestine. On his
return hisﬁrst book, “ Nile Notes of a Howadji,” was published,
and he began to deliver lectures. He became connected with
the publishing house of Harper & Brothers, and also wrote for
the “ New York Tribune” and “Putna1n’s Monthly.” In this

They were afterward published in book form and met
with success. The charm of the latter book is as fresh to-day as
when it was ﬁrst written. .

For many years, Curtis held the position of editor of “ Harper’ s

I AM the owner of great estates. Many of them lie
in the west, but the greater part are in Spain. You
may see my western possessions any evening at sun-
set, when their spires and battlements ﬂash against the
horizon. T ' ‘s

It gives me a feeling of pardonable importance, as a
proprietor, that they are visible, to my eyes at least,
from any part of the world in which I chance to be.
In my long voyage around the Cape of Good Hope to
India (the only voyage I ever made, when I was a boy
and a supercargo), if I fell homesick, or sank into a rev-

ery of all the pleasant homes I had left behind, I had

but to wait until sunset, and then looking toward the
west, I beheld my clustering pinnacles and towers,
brightly burnished, as if to salute and welcome me.

. So, in the city, if I get vexed and wearied, and can-
not find my wonted solace in sallying forth at dinner-
time to contemplate the gay world of youth and beauty,
I go quietly up to the house-top, toward evening, and

refresh myself with a distant prospect of my estates-

And” if I sometimes wonder at such moments whether
I shall ﬁnd those realms as fair as they appear, I am

and, descending, I enter the little parlor whereniy
wife, Prue, sits stitching, and surprise that precious
woman by exclaiming with the poet’s enthusiasm: c

“ Thought would destroy their Paradise
No more ; 4—Where ignorance is bliss
’T is folly to be wise.”

Columbus also had possessions in the west ; and as I
read aloud the romantic story of his life, my Voice

quivers when I come to the point in which it is related I

that sweet odors of the land mingled with the sea air,

T as the admiral’s ﬂeet approached the shores; that trop-

ical birds ﬂew out and ﬂuttered around the ships, glit- ‘

tering in the sun, the gorgeous promises of the new
country; that boughs, perhaps with blossoms not all

  decayed, ﬂoated out to welcome the strange wood from

which the craft was hollowed. Then I cannot restrain
myself. I think of the gorgeous Visions I have seen
before I have even undertaken the journey to the West,
and I cry aloud to Prue : — I I

“ What sun-bright birds and gorgeous blossoms and
celestial odors will ﬂoat out to us, my Prue, as we
approach our western possessions!”

 The placid Prue raises her eyes to mine with a

reproof so delicate that it could not be trusted to
words; and after a moment she resumes herknitting
and I proceed. ' , , 

c These are my western estates, but my ﬁnest castles
are in Spain. It is a country famously romantic, and

my castles are all of perfect proportions and appro-
priately set in the most picturesque situations. I have
never been to Spain myself, but I have naturally con-
versed much with travelers to that country. _ The wisest
of them told me that there Were more holders of real
estate in Spain than in any other region he had ever

said, I veriﬁed it by discovering that all my immediate
neighbors inthe city were great Spanish proprietors.

One day, as I raised my head from entering some
long and tedious accounts in  books, and began to
reﬂect that the quarter Was expiring, and that I must
‘begin to prepare the balance sheet, I observed my sub-
ordinate in office, but not in years (for the poor old
clerk will never see sixty again!) leaning on his hand,
and much abstracted. I '

“Are you not Well ? ” asked I.

“ Perfectly, but I Was justsbuilding a castle in Spain,”
said he. ,  

I looked at his rusty coat, his faded hands, his sad
eye, and White hair for a moment in great surprise, an
then inquired : —e .  

“ Is it possible that you own property there too ? ’.’

He shook his head‘ silently; and still leaning on his I
hand, and with an expression in his eye as if he were

looking upon the most fertile estate of Andalusia, he
went on making his plans: laying out his gardens, I
suppose, building terraces for the vines, determining a
library with a southern exposure, and resolving which
should be the tapestried chamber. s
"I??I3E'hat a singular whim!” thought I as I watched
him and ﬁlled up a check for four hundred dollars, my
quarterly salary, “ that a man who owns castles in Spain
should be a bookkeeper at nine hundred dollars a year ! ”

It is not easy for me to say how I know so much,

They command a noble view of the Alps; so ﬁne,
indeed, that I‘ should be quite content with the pros-

not care to go to Switzerland. -

The neighboring ruins, too, are as picturesque as those
of Italy. The rich gloom of my orange groves isgilded
by fruit as brilliant of complexion and exquisite of

The Nile ﬂows through my grounds. The desert lies
upon their edge, and Damascus stands in  garden.
From the windows of those castles look the beautiful
women whom I have never seen, whose portraits the

5 poets have painted. They wait for me there, and chieﬂy
the fair-haired child, lost to my eyes so long ago‘,-now
bloomed into an impossible beauty. In the long, sum-
mer mornings the children that I never had, play in the
gardens that I never planted. I hear their sweet voices

10 sounding low and far away, calling, “Father! father!”
I see the lost, fair-haired girl, grown now into a woman,

' descending the stately stairs of my castle in Spain,
stepping out upon the lawn, and playing with those
children. They bound away together down the garden;

15 but those voices linger, this time airily calling, “ Mother!
mother! ”
» But there is a stranger magic than this in my Spanish
estates. The lawny slopes on which, when a child, I
played in my father’s old country place, which was sold
20 when he failed, are all there, and not a ‘ﬂower faded,
nor ablade of grass sere. The green leaves have not
fallen from the spring woods of half a century ago, and
a gorgeous autumn has blazed undimmed for ﬁfty years
among the trees I remember.
25 Chestnutsare not especially sweet to my palate now,
but those with which I used to prick my ﬁngers when
. gathering them in New Hampshire woods are exquisite
as: ever to my taste when I think of eating them in

Spain. I never ride horseback now at home, but in

Spain, when I think of it, I bound over all the fences
in the country, bareback upon the wildest horses.
  Yes; and in those castles in Spain, Prue is not the
placid helpmate with whom you are acquainted, but
her face has as bloom which we both remember, and
her movement a grace which my Spanish swans emu-
late, and her voice a music sweeter than orchestras dis-
course. She isialways there what she seemed to me
when I fell in love with her many and many years ago.
So,‘ when I meditate my Spanish castles, I see Prue
in them as my heart saw her standing by her father’s
“Age cannot wither her.” There is a magic in
the Spanish air that paralyzes Time. He glides by
unnoticed and unnoticing. I greatly admire the Alps,

which .I see so distinctly from my Spanish windows ;.
  I delight in the taste of the southern fruit that ripens

upon my terraces; I enjoy the pensive shade of the
Italian ruins in my gardens; I like to shoot crocodiles,

10

and talk with the Sphinx upon the shores of the Nile  
ﬂowing through my domain; but I would resign all 20
these forever rather than part with that Spanish por- .

trait of Prue for a day.

THREE HEROINES.
  AGNES REPPLIER.

. To Spain belongs Augustina, the Maid of Saragossa;

to England, brave Mary Ambree; and to America,
. Molly Pitcher, the stout-he_arted heroine of Monmouth;

and these three Women Won for themselves honor and
5 renown by the same valorous exploits.

Augustina is the most to be envied, for her praises
have been sung by a great poet; Mary Ambree has
a noble ballad to perpetuate her fame; Molly Pitcher
is still Without the tribute of a verse to remind her

10 countrymen occasionally of her splendid courage in
the ﬁeld.   “~\ S . ‘

The Spanish girl Was‘: of humble birth, young, poor,
and very handsome. When Saragossa was besieged by
the French, during the Peninsular War, she carried

15 food every afternoon to the soldiers Who Were defend-
ing the batteries. One day theattack Was so ﬁerce,

and the ﬁre so deadly, that by the gate of Portillo

not a single man was left alive to repulse the terrible
enemy. »

20  When Augustina reached the spotwith her basket
of coarse and scanty provisions, she saw the last gunner
fall bleeding on the Walls. Not for an instant did she
hesitate ; but springing over a pile of dead bodies, she
snatched the match from his stiffening ‘ﬁngers and

25 ﬁred the gun herself.

'**81313<*-

Then calling on her countrymen to rally their

A broken ranks, she led them back so unﬂinchingly to

the charge that the French were driven from the gate
they had so nearly captured, and the honor of Spain
was saved.  

For the story of Mary Ambree we must leave the
chroniclers, who to their own loss and shame never
mention her at all, and take refuge -with the poets.
From them we learn all we need to know; and it is
quickly told.

Her lover was slain treacherously in the war between
Spain and Holland, the English being then allies of the

F Dutch; and, vowing to avenge his death, she put on

his armor and marched to the siege of Ghent, where
she fought with reckless courage on its walls.

Fortune favors the brave, and wherever the maiden

turned her arms the enemy was repulsed, until at last
the Spanish soldiers vied with the English in admira-
tion of this valorous foe. . . .

And now for Molly Pitcher, who, unsung and almost
unremembered, should nevertheless share in the honors
heaped so liberally upon the English and Spanish hero-
ines. “A red-haired, freckle-faced young Irish woman,”
without beauty and without distinction, she was the
newly wedded wife of an artilleryman in Washington’s
little army. On June 28, 1778, was fought the battle
of Monmouth, famous for the admirable tactics by
which Washington regained the advantages lost through
the negligence of General Charles Lee.

It was a Sunday morning, close and sultry. As the
day advanced, the soldiers on both sides suffered terri-
bly from that ﬁerce, unrelenting heat in which America
rivals India.. The thermometer stood at 96° in the
shade. Men fell dead in their ranks without a wound,
smitten by sunstroke; and the sight of them ﬁlled

Molly Pitcher, regardless of everything save the an-
guish of the sweltering, thirsty troops, carried buckets

of water from a neighboring spring and passed them‘

along the line. Backward and forward she trudged,
this strong, brave, patient young woman, while the
sweat poured down her freckled face, and her bare
arms blistered in the sun. '
She was a long time in reaching her husband,—so
many soldiers begged for drink as she toiled by, — but

at last she saw him, parched, grimy, and spent with

heat, and she quickened her lagging steps. Then sud-

denly a ball whizzed past, and he fell dead by the side i

of his gun before ever the coveted water had touched
his blackened lips. i s

Molly dropped her bucket and for one dazed moment
stood staring at the bleeding corpse. Only for a mo-
ment, for, amid the turmoil of battle, she heard the
order given to drag her husband’s cannon from the
ﬁeld.  

The words roused her to life and purpose. She
seized the . rammer from the grass and hurried to the
gunner’s post. There was nothing strange in the work

i~>e1sse<~

to her. She was too well versed in the ways of war
for either ignorance or alarm. S

Strong, skilful, and fearless, she stood by the weapon
and directed its deadly ﬁre until the fall of Monckton
turned the tide of victory. The British troops "under

  Clinton were beaten back after a desperate struggle,

the Americans took possession of the ﬁeld, and the
battle of Monmouth waswon.

On the following day poor Molly, no longer a fi1ri-  

ous Amazon, but sad-faced, with swollen eyes and a
scanty bit of crape pinned on her bosom, was presented

. to Washington, and received a sergeant’s commission
‘with half pay for life.

It is said that the French ofﬁcers,_then ﬁghting for
the freedom of the colonies, that is, against the English,
were so delighted with her courage that they added to

this reward a cocked hat full of gold pieces, and chris-

tened her “ La Capitaine.”

What befell her in after years has never been told.
She lived and died obscurely, and her name has well-
nigh been forgotten in the land she served. But the
memory of brave deeds can never wholly perish, and
Molly Pitcher has won for herself a niche in the Temple
of Fame, where her companions are fair Mary Ambree

and the dauntless Maid of Saragossa.

ENSIGN EPPS, THE COLOR-BEARER.
JOHN BOYLE O’REILLY.

JOHN BOYLE O’RE1LLY Was born in Ireland, June 28, 1844.
He began life as a type-setter, and -later went to England and
became a reporter for various newspapers. Returning to Ireland,

he joined the 10th Hussars, with the secret intention of spread-

ing the Irish cause among the soldiers. ‘His purpose was dis-
covered, and he Was sentenced to be shot. This sentence was
commuted, and he Was sent to the English prisoncolony in Aus-
tralia. From there" he escaped in an open boat andwas picked
up at sea by Captain Gifford of the American ship, “Gazelle,”
and brought to America. He Wrote and lectured in this country,
and became the editor of the “ Boston Pilot.”

Among his Works are “Songs of the Southern Seas,” ‘~’ Songs,

Legends, and Ballads,” and “ In Bohemia.” He died in Hull,

Mass., Aug. 10, 1890.

ENSIGN EPPS, at the battle of Flanders,
Sowed a seed of glory. and duty, g. ,
That ﬂowers and flames in height and beauty
, Like a crimson lily With heart of gold,

To-day, when the Wars of Ghent are old,

And buried as deep as their dead commanders.

Ensign Epps was the color-bearer—  
No matter on Which side, Philip or Earl ;

Their cause was the shell— his deed was the pearl. M

Scarce more than a lad, he had been a sharer

That day in the wildest Work of the ﬁeld.

He Was Wounded and spent, and the ﬁght was lost;
His comrades Were slain, or a scattered host.

But stainless and scathless out of the strife

He had carried his colors, safer than life.

By the riVer’s brink, Without weapon or shield,
He faced the victors. The thick heart-mist

He dashed from his eyes, and the silk he kissed
Ere he held it aloft in the setting sun,

, . As proudly as if the ﬁght had been Won,

And he smiled when they ordered him to yield.

Ensign Epps, with his broken blade,

Cut the silk from the gilded staff,  L
Which he poised like -a spear till the charge Was made,
And hurled at the leader with a laugh. p

Then round his breast, like the scarf of his love,

He tied the colors his heartabove,

And plunged in his armor into the tide,

' And there, in his dress of honor, died.

Where are the lessons ye kinglings teach?

And What is the text of your proud commanders?
Out of the centuries, heroes reach

With the scroll of a deed, with the word of a story,
Of one man’s truth and of all men’s glory,

Like Ensign Epps at the battle of Flanders. f

THE BATTLE OF LANDEN.

[ABR1DGED.]

THOMAS BABINGTON MACAULAY.

r THOMAS BABINGTON MACAULAY was born in England on the
25th of October, 1800.

He gave proof of a decided taste for literature when a lit-

tle child. From the time he was three years old he spent the

5 greater part of his time in reading, and liked to lie on a rug

before the ﬁre with his book before

him. He was a quaint little fellow.
and talked in the language of the
books which he read.

Before he was eight years old he
had written a history and a romance.
His early education was received
in private schools, and he entered
Trinity College, Cambridge, when
he was eighteen years old. He en-
joyed his college life, and succeeded
in gaining a fellowship of three
hundred pounds and a prize for
an essay.

20 After his graduation he began to practice law in London, but
had little business, and spent more time at the House of Com-
mons than in the court.

When he was twenty-four he made a speech which surprised
the audience by its eloquence and was praised in the F‘ Edinburgh

25 Review}? The next year this magazine published an essay on
Milton written by Macaulay, which made the young man famous.

He was invited to dinners and honored by the most distin-
guished persons in London. His gift as a brilliant and entertain-
ing talker increased his popularity.

+>81378<*

In 1830 he became a member of the House of Commons and
distinguished himself by his eloquent speeches. He continued
to contribute to the “Edinburgh Review,” and took an active part
in the question of slavery in India.

A few years later he was sent by the Government to India,
where his services proved of great value. One of his sisters
accompanied him, and he remained there four years.

On his return he became a member of Parliament, and for two
years was Secretary of War. His duties were light, and he en-
gaged in literary work. He became deeply interested in writing
a history of England, and retired to private life in order to devote

10

his time to this work. He worked slowly and carefully, sparing  

no pains in searching for material.

The ﬁrst two volumes, published in 1849, had an enormous
sale, both in England and America. Three more volumes were
completed seven years later. This history has been published
in a dozen different languages, and Macaulay received many
ﬂattering marks of admiration and respect.

After resigning his seat in Parliament he went to Holly Lodge,
Kensington. It was a delightful house, with a large library and
a. garden. Macaulay was very happy there. On his return to
Holly Lodge, after a trip through Germany and Italy, he writes:
“ My garden is really charming. The ﬂowers are less brilliant
than when I went away, but the turf is perfect emerald. All the
countries through which I have been traveling could not show
such a carpet of soft, rich, green herbage as mine.” He died on
the 28th of December, 1859, and was buried in the Poets’ Corner
at Westminster Abbey. '

THOUGH the French army in the Netherlands had
been weakened by the departure of forces,and though
the allied army was daily strengthened by the arrival

of fresh troops,LuXembourg still had a superiority of

force; and that superiority he increased by an adroit
stratagem,

15

—->8138B*‘-

He marched towards Liege, and made as if he were
about‘ -b0._form the siege of that city. William was
uneasy, and the. more uneasy because he knew there
was a French party among the inhabitants. He quitted

5 his position near Louvairl',‘advanced~ to Nether Hespen,
and encamped ‘there, with the r1‘ve.LGrette in his rear.

This was exactly what General Luxembourg had ex-
pected and desired. He turned his back on‘ the 
tress, which had hitherto seemed to be his object, and

10 hastened toward the Grette. .  

William, Prince of Orange, who had but ﬁfty thou-
sand left in his camp, was alarmed by learning from
his scouts that the French general, with near eighty
thousand, was close at hand.  

15 It was still in the king’s power, by a hasty retreat,
to put the narrow but deep waters of the Gette be-
tween his army and the enemy. But the site which
he occupied was strong; and it could easily be made
still stronger. He set all his troops to work. Ditches

20 were dug, mounds thrown up, palisades ﬁxed in the

‘ earth, and the king trusted that he should be able to
repel the attack even of a force greatly outnumbering
his own. . H

Luxembourg, however, was determined to try

25 whether even this positioncould be maintained against;
the superior numbers and the impetuous valor of his
soldiers. Soon after sunrise the roar of the cannon
began to be heard. Wi1liam’s batteries did much exe-
cution before the French artillery could be so placed

->8l398<-

as to return ﬁre. It was eight o’clock before the close
ﬁghting began. The village of Neerwinden was re-
garded by both commanders as the point on which
everything depended.

There an attack was made by the French left wing,
commanded by Montchevreuil, a veteran officer of high
reputation, and by Berwick, who, though young, was fast
rising to a high place among the captains of his time.

Berwick led the onset and forced his way into the
village, but was soon driven out again with a terrible
carnage. His followers ﬂed or perished; he, while
trying to rally them, was surrounded by foes. He con-
cealed his white cockade and ‘hoped to be able, by the
help of his native tongue, to pass himself oﬁ as an
oﬂicer of the English army. But his face was recog-
nized by one of his mother’s brothers, who held on that
day the command of a brigade. A hurried embrace
was exchanged between the kinsmen, and the uncle
conducted the nephew to William.

By this time, the French, who had been driven in

10

20

confusion out of Neerwinden, had been reinforced by a  

division and came gallantly back to the attack. This!

second conﬂict was long and bloody. The assailants
again forced entrance into the village.
driven out with tremendous slaughter, and showed
little inclination to return to the charge.

Meanwhile» the battle had been raging all along the
intrenchments of the allied army. Again and again

At length Luxembourg formed ‘his decision. A last
attempt must be made to carry Neerwinden; and the
invincible household troops, the conquerors of Stein-
kirk, must lead the way. A A s

The household troops came on in a manner Worthy
A third time N eer-
winden was taken. is A third time William tried to
retake it. At the head of some English regiments he
charged the guards of Louis, the French king, with
such fury that, for the ﬁrst time in the memory of the
oldest warrior, that far-famed band gave way. It was
only by strenuous exertions that the broken ranks
Were rallied. p

A little after four in the afternoon the whole line
All was havoc and confusion. The Duke
of Ormond was struck down in the press; and in an-
other moment he would have been a corpse, had not
a rich, diamond on his ﬁnger caught the eye of one of
the French guards, who justly thought ‘that the owner

of such a jewel would be a valuable prisoner. The  
duke’s life was saved; and he was speedily exchanged k

for Berwick.
It was only on such occasions as this that the whole

greatness of William’s character appeared. Amidst

the rout and uproar, while arms and standards were
ﬂung away, while multitudes of fugitives were choking
up the bridges and fords of the Gette, or perishing in

its waters, the king put himself at the head of a few . 4

brave regiments and by desperate efforts arrested the
progress of the enemy. H

His risk was greater than that which others ran, for
he could not be persuaded to encumber his feeble frame
with a cuirass, or to hide the ensigns of the garter.
He thought his star a good rallying point for his own
troops, and only smiled when he was told that it was
a good mark for the enemy.

Many fell at his right hand and at his left. Two  

led horses, which in the ﬁeld always followed his per-
son, were struck dead by cannon shots. One musket
ball passed through the curls of his wig, another

' through his coat, a third bruised his side and tore his

blue riband to tatters. ‘

Many years later, gray-headed old pensioners, who
crept about the arcades and alleys of Chelsea Hospital,
used to relate how he charged at the head of Galway’s
horse, how he dismounted four times to put heart into
the infantry, how he rallied one corps which seemed to
be shrinking: F‘ That is not the way to ﬁght, gentle-
You must stand close up to them. Thus, gentle-
men, thus.” “ You might have seen him,” an eyewitness

Wrote only four days after the battle, “with his sword H

in his hand, fhrowing himself upon the enemy. It is
certain that one time, among the rest, he was seen at
the head of two English regiments, and that he fought
seven with these two in sight of the whole army, driv-
ing them before him above a quarter of an hour.
Thanks be to God who preserved him!”

The enemy pressed on him so close that it was with
difficulty that he at length made his way over the
Grette. A small body of brave men who shared his
peril to the last, could hardly keep off the pursuers as

which the progress of civilization has produced in the
art of war more strikingly illustrated than on that day.

THE PLANTING cir THE APPLE TREE.  A

 

JIVILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT. 

For an account of the life of Bryant, see “ Cyr’s Third Reader.”

  
 
   
 

COME, let us plant the apple tree. 
Cleave the toug greensward with the spad  
Wide let its hollo bed be made;

Sift the dark mould with kindly care,
And press it o’er them tenderly,

As round the sleeping infant’s feet,

We softly fold the cradle—sheet;   r ‘ . 
So plant we the apple tree.  > _  * 

  

What plant we in thisiéapple tree?    I ‘ j it 
Buds, Which_the breath of summer days ,  “‘ *
Shall lengthen into leafy sprays; A
Boughs where the thrush with crimson breast,
Shall haunt, and sing, and hide her nest;

We plant upon the sunny lea,

A shadow for the noontide hour,
A shelter from the summer shower,
  When We plant the apple tree.

, What plant we in this apple tree?
Sweets for a hundred ﬂowery springs

. To load the May-Wind’s restless Wings, .

When, from the orchard-row, he pours

Its fragrance through our open doors; A A

->814-4 3+

A world of blossoms for the bee,
Flowers for the sick girl’s silent room,
For the glad infant sprigs of bloom,

We plant With the apple tree.

What plant We in this apple tree?
Fruits that shall swell in sunny June,
And redden in the August noon,

And drop When gentle airs come by, i
That fan the blue September sky,

While children come, With cries of glee,
And seek them Where the fragrant grass
Betrays their bed to those who pass,

At the foot of the apple tree.

And when, above this apple tree,
The Winter stars are quivering bright,

_ S ./And Winds go howling through the night,

Girls, Whose young eyes o’erﬂoW with mirth,
Shall peel its fruit by the cottage hearth,
And guests in prouder homes shall see,
Heaped with the grape of Cintra’s Vine
And golden orange of the line
The fruit of the apple tree.

Thefruitage of this apple tree
Winds and our ﬂag of stripe and star
Shall bearto coasts that lie afar,
Where men shall Wonder at the View
And ask in What fair groves they grew;

..>514-53+

And sojourners beyond the sea
Shall think of childhood’s careless day
And long, long hours of summer play,
‘In the shade of the apple tree.  

Each year shall give this apple tree
A broader ﬂush of roseate bloom,
A deeper maze of Verdurous gloom,
And loosen, when the frost—clouds lower,
The crisp brown leavesin thicker shower.

And time shall waste this apple tree.
Oh, when its aged branches throw
Thin shadows on the ground below,
Shall fraud and force and iron will
Oppress the weak and helpless still?

What shall the tasks of mercy be,
Amid the toils, the strifes, the tears
Of those who live when length of years

Is wasting this apple tree?

“Who planted this old apple tree?”

The children of that distant day

Thus to some aged man shall say;

And, gazing on its mossy stem,

The gray-haired man shall answer them :‘
“ A poet of the land was he,

, Born in the rude but good old times;

’T is said"he made some quaint old rhymes
On planting the apple tree.” A

A C HIGHLAND SNOWSTORM. .1  
[ABRIDGED.] p

JOHN WILSON.

JOHN WILSON, better known as “ Christopher North,’,’l was born

at Paisley, Scotland, in 1785, and died in Edinburgh in 1854.
He entered the University at Glasgow when he was twelve
years old and completed his education at Oxford. r
5 After leaving college he went to live on his estate, which was
delightfully situated on Lake Windermere, near the homes of
Wordsworth and Coleridge. He spent four yearerthere in boating,
ﬁshing, and hunting. ‘ He was married when he was twenty-six,
and soon afterwards published a volume of poems. He continued

' 10 to live an idle, out-of-door life until the loss of a large share of his

fortune, when he went to Edinburgh and began to study law.

He decided, however, to devote himself to literature,‘ and
wrote many articles for “ Blackwood’s Magazine,” signing him-
self “Christopher North.” '

  

15 —. ‘When he was thirty—ﬁve years old, Mr. ilson was elected C

professor in the University at Edinburgh, and» eld this position
for thirty years.‘ n ~ v , ‘

1 O E family lived in Glencreran, and another in
. Glencoe —the families oftwo, brothers. Each had an:

20 only child — a son and a daughter —— born on the same

day”? Thus had these cousins grown up before their

parent’s eyes—Flora Macdonald, a name hallowed of

yore, the fairest, and Ronald Cameron, the boldest of

  i  the living ﬂowers in Grlenmcoe and Glencreran.
 It was now their seventeenth" birthday, and Flora
C was to pass the day in Grlencreran. g Ronald was to

meet her in the mountains, that he might bring a her,

»>g1478<~

down the precipitous passes to his father’s hut; and
soon they met at the trysting place, a bank of birch
trees beneath a cliff that takes its name from the
eagles. .

On their meeting, seemed not to them the whole of
nature suddenly inspired with joy and beauty? From
tree roots, where the snow was thin, little ﬂowers, or
herbs ﬂower-like, now for the ﬁrst time, were seen look-
ing out as if alive; the trees seemed budding, as if it
were already spring; and rare as in that rocky region
are the birds of song, a faint trill for a moment touched
their ears, and the ﬂutter of a wing. Deep downbe-
neath the snow they listened to the tinkle of rills

lg unreached by the frost, and merry, thought they, was

the ‘music of these contented prisoners.

The boy starts to his feet, and his keen eye looks‘

along the ready riﬂe; for his sires had all been famous
deer-stalkers, and the passion of the chase was in his
blood. Lo! a deer from Dalness, hound-driven, or sul-
lenly astray, ‘slowly bearing’ his antlers up the glen,

p then stopping for a moment to snuff the air, then

away — away! The riﬂe-shot rings dully from the

15‘

20

scarce echoing snow cliffs, and the animal leaps aloft, 1

1 struck by a certain death wound. Laboring and lum-
bering heavily along, the huge animal at last disappears
' around some rocks .at the head of the glen. r

“Follow me, Flora ! ” the boy-hunter cries; and

‘ ﬂinging downtheir plaids they turn their bright faces
. to the mountain, and away up the glen after the

+>a1488<+

stricken deer. Redder and redder grew the snow, and
cmore heavily trampled, as they winded around the
rocks. ”
Yonder is the deer, staggering up the mountain, not
5 half a mile off-—now standing at bay,‘as if before his
swimming eyes came Fingal, the terror of the forest,
» whose howl was known to all the echoes, and quailed
the herd while their antlers were yet afar off. “ Rest,
Flora, rest! while I ﬂy to him with my riﬂe and shoot
10 him.” '

The boy, maddened by the chase, pressed forward, ,

now alone, and thus he was hurried on for miles, till
at last he struck the noble quarry, and down sank the
antlers in the snow, while the air was spurned by the
15 convulsive beatings of feet. Then leaped Ronald upon
the red deer and lifted a look of ‘triumph to the moun-
i ‘tain-tops.  

Where is Flora? Ronald has forgotten her, and he
is alone ——he and the deer—an enormous animal, fast

20 stiffening in the frost of death.
Some large ﬂakes of snoware in the air, and they

seem to waver and whirl, though an hour ago there ,

was not a breath. Faster they fall and faster; the
ﬂakes are as large as leaves; and overhead whence so

25 suddenly has come that huge, yellow cloud? ‘;‘ Flora,
where are you? whereare you, Flora?” and from the
huge animal the boy leaps up and sees that no'Flora
is at hand.

" But yonder  a moving speck, far off upon the snow.

A5149 3<~

’T is she! ’tis she! Shrill as the eagle’s cry he sends  

a shout down the glen, and Flora is at last by his side.
Painting and speechless she stands, and then dizzily
sinks upon his breast. Her hair is ruffled by the
wind, and her face moistened "by the snowﬂakes, now 5
not falling but driven. Her shivering frame misses
the warmth of the plaid, which almost no cold can
penetrate.   .

What would the miserable boy give now for the

coverings lying far away, which in his foolish passion 10

he had ﬂung down to chase that fatal deer? “Oh,
Flora, if you would not fear to stay here by yourself,

. ‘under the protection of God, soon would I go and come

from the place where our plaids are lying; and under
the shelter of the deer we may be able to outlive the 15
hurricane.” '  
‘ “ I will go with you down the glen, Ronald”; but,
weak as a day-old lamb, she tottered and fell down in
the snow. The cold had chilled her very heart, after ,  
the heat of that long race; and it was manifest that 20
here she must be for the night, to live or to die. r
“I will go and leave you with God,” said Ronald;
and he went and came as if he had been endowed with
eagles’ wings.  
All at once Ronald lifted Flora in his arms, and 25
walked up the glen. Some Walls of what had once,
been a house, he had suddenly remembered, were but
a short way off. There it was—a snowdjiift at the
opening that had been once a door ;, the wood of the

were falling in, as if they would soon ﬁll the inside
of the ruin. The snow in front was all trampled, as
if by sheep; and carrying in his burden, Ronald saw

together, looked on him as on a shepherd come to see

breath seemed to be gone; and yet something convinced
his heart that she was yet alive. The ruined hut was
rooﬂess, but across an_ angle of the walls some pine
branches had been ﬂung, as a sort of shelter for the
sheep or cattle that might repair thither in stormy
weather. a '

Into that corner the snowdrift had not yet forced

its waywand he sat down there with Flora. The chill

air was somewhat softened by the breath of the had-
dled ﬂock, and the edge of the cutting wind blunted
by the stones. ’

Bright was the peat ﬁre in the hut of Flora’s parents T

in Grlencoe, and they were among the happiest of the
humble happy, blessing this the birthday of their
blameless child. They thought of her singing her
sweet songs by the ﬁreside of the hut in Glencreran,
and tender thoughts of her cousin
them in their prayers.  

So was it now with the dwellers in the hut at the

head of Glencreran. Their Ronald had left them in

the morning; night had come, and he and Flora were

‘not there; but they never doubted that the happy

creatures had changed their minds, and that Ronald J

had returned .with Flora to Glencoe.

But the inland storm had been seen brewing among
the mountains, and down through the long cliff-pass
went a band of shepherds, trampling their way across
a hundred frozen stre tms. Away over the drift-bridged
chasms toiled that gathering, with their sheep-dogs
scouring the loose snows in the van, Fingal, the Red
Beaver, with his head aloft on the lookout for deer.
Following the dogs, who know their duties, the band
are now close to the ruined hut.

Why bark the sheep-dogs so? and why howls Fin-
gal, as if some spirit passed athwart the night ?, He
scents the body of the boy who so often had shouted
him on in the forest when the antlers went by. Not
dead—nor dead she who is on his bosom. Yet will
the red blood in their veins ever again be thawed

Almost pitch dark is the rooﬂess ruin; and the

frightened sheep know not what is that terrible shape a n

that is howling» there. But a man enters and lifts up

one of the bodies, giving it into the arms of those at:

the doorway, and then lifts the other; and by theﬂash
of a riﬂe they see it is Ronald Cameron and Flora
Macdonald, seemingly both frozen to death. But the

noble dog knows that death is not there, and licks the ‘ F

face of Ronald, as if he would restore life to his eyes.
The storm, was with them all the way down the

glen; nor could they have heard each other’s voices;
but mutely they shifted the burden from strong hand
to hand, thinking of the hut at Glencoe, and of what
would be felt there on their arrival.

Instinct, reason, and faith conducted the saving
band along; and now they are at Glencoe, and at the

j door of the hut.

 To life were brought the dead and there, at mid-
night, sat they up like ghosts. Then, as if in holy
fear, they gazed in each other’s faces, thinking that
they had awakened in heaven. “ Flora I ” said Ronald ;
and that word, the first he had been able to speak,
reminded him of all that had passed, and he knew that
the God in whom they had put their trust had sent
them deliverance.

LEARNING BY HEART..
VERNON LUSHINGTON.

TILL he has fairly tried it, I suspect a reader does
not know how much he would gain from committing to
memory passages of real excellence ; precisely because
he does not know how much he overlooks in merely
reading. Learn one true poem by heart, and see if
you do not ﬁnd it so. Beauty after» beauty will reveal
itself, in vchosen phrase, or happy music, or noble sug-
gestion otherwise undreamed of. It is like looking at
one of nature’s wonders through a microscope.

»>a1538<—

Again, how much in suchia poem that you really did

feel admirable and lovely on a ﬁrst reading passes away “

if you do not give it a further and much better reading!
—passes away utterly, like a sweet sound, or an image
on the lake, which the ﬁrst breath of wind dispels. If
you could only ﬁx that image, as the photographers do
theirs, so beautifully, so perfectly! And you can do
so ! Learnit by heart, and it is yours forever!

Poems and noble extracts, whether of verse or prose,

once so reduced into possession and rendered truly our

own, may be to us a daily pleasure——better far than
a whole library unused. They may come to us in our
dull moments, to refresh us as with spring ﬂowers; in
our selﬁsh musings, to win us by pure delight from
the tyranny of foolish castle-building, self-congratula-
tions, and mean anxieties. They may be with us in
the workshop, in the crowded streets, by the ﬁreside;
sometimes, perhaps, on pleasant hillsides, or by sound-
ing shores—noble friends and companions, our own!
never intrusive, ever at hand, coming at our call!

memory and by memory. I can imagine a chance

renewal, chance visitation of the words long remem-

bered, long garnered in the heart, and I think I see a
gleam of rare joy in the eyes of the old man-

+>8154-8¢-

For those, in particular, whose leisure time is short,
and precious as scant rations to beleaguered men, I
believe there could not be a better expenditure of time

than deliberately giving an occasional hour—it re- -
5 quires no more ——to committing to memory chosen pas- ,

sages from great authors. If the mind were thus daily
nourished with a few choice words of the best English

poets and writers; if the habit of learning by heart

were to become so general that, as a matter of course,
10 any person presuming to be educated amongst us might
be expected to be equipped with a few good pieces,—
I believe it would lead, far more than the mere sound
of it ‘suggests, to the diffusion of the best kind of litera-
ture and the right appreciation of it, and men would
15 not long rest satisﬁed with having a few stock pieces.
The only objection I can conceive to what I have
been saying is, that it may be said that a relish for
higher literature belongs only to the few; that it is the
result of cultivation ; and that there is no use in try-
2o ing to create what must be in general only a ﬁctitious
interest. But I do not admit that literature, even the
higher literature, must belong to the few.“ Poetry is,
in the main, addressed to all men; and_ though some
poetry requires particular knowledge and superior
25 culture, much, and that the noblest, needs only natural
feelingand the light of common experience.
. To abandon all recitation is to give up a custom which
has given delight and instruction to all the races of artic-
ulately speaking men. If our faces are set against vain

—~>81558<"

display, and set towards rational enjoyment of one an-
other, each freely giving his best, and freely receiving
what his neighbor offers, we need not fear that our so-
cial evenings will be marred by an occasional recitation,
or that the ﬁne passages will wither. And, moreover,

it is not for reciting’s sake that I chieﬂy recommend

this most faithful form of reading—learning by heart.

I come back, therefore, to this, that learning by heart
is a good thing, and is neglected amongst us. Why is it
neglected? Partly because of our indolence, but partly,
I take it, because we do not sufficiently consider that it
is a good thing, and needs to be taken in hand. We need
to be reminded of it ; I here remind you. Like a town-
crier, ringing my bell, I would say to you, “ O-yes,
o-yes !o Lost, stolen, or strayed, a good ancient prac-
tice—the good ancient practice of learning by heart.
Every ﬁnder should be handsomely rewarded.” . . .   a

If any ask, I“ What shall I learn ?” the answer is,
“ Do as you do with tunes ; begin with what you sin-
cerely like best, what you would most wish to remem-
ber, what you would most enjoy saying to yourself or
repeating to another.” You will soon ﬁnd the list in-
exhaustible. Every one has spare ten minutes; one of
the problems of life is how to employ them usefully.
You may well spend some in looking after and securing
this good property you have won.

A COURT LADY.
ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.

ELIZABETH BARRETT was born in England on the 6th of
March, 1806. Her father was a wealthy Englishman, and
shortly after the birth of this daughter he built a country
house in Herefordshire—“a luxurious home standing in a
park, among trees, and sloping
hills all sprinkled with sheep.”

Elizabeth, a slender little maiden
with dark eyes, soft curls, and a
smile like a sunbeam, occupied a
room in the upper part of the
house, where she could look out
upon the tree-tops and listen to
the soft notes of the birds.

Each of the children of the
family had a garden of his own,
and Elizabeth was so fond of
white roses that she had a bower
  overgrown with them.

Her tutor found in her a remarkable pupil, and at eight years

20 of age the little girl was reading Greek, often holding her book
in one hand while she nursed her doll on her arm.

sHer father was very proud of his little daughter, and when

she was between eleven and twelve he had one of her poems,

“ The Battle of Marathon,” published for his own library.

25 But her time was not all spent in study. She loved to play

with her brothers and sisters, and ride her black pony, Moses,
about the country. One day in trying to saddle him in the
ﬁeld, she fell and injured her back, so that for years she was a
helpless invalid. This trial did not prevent her from living" as
30 she had dreamed and hoped to live, and she continued to read

and write in her seclusion.
Her mother died. when Elizabeth was twenty, and her father

—~>81578«-

was unfortunate in business, so that he was obliged to sell his
beautiful home, and the family went to London.

Elizabeth was seldom able to leave her room, but continued
to write. Her name soon became known to the world. One of
her ﬁrst works to attract attention was “Prometheus,” which
was published when she was twenty-six years old.

Many a sweet and tender poem came from her pen, and she
always wrote on the side of truth and freedom.

1 She became acquainted with Robert Browning, another of
England’s great poets, and they were married in 1846. Mr.

Browning took his wife to Florence, Italy, and the sunny skies

of that country partially restored her health.

“ Casa Guidi Windows,” one of Mrs. Browning’s strongest
poems, was written during her life in Florence, as she looked from
her windows upon the Italian people struggling for freedom.

10

15

“Aurora Leigh” is Mrs. Browning’s most famous work. .

Every page is filled with beauty. This most gifted of women-
poets died at Florence in 1861.

HER hair was tawny with gold, her eyes with purple
’ were dark, F _ "
Her cheeks’ pale opal burnt with a red and restless spark.

Never was lady of Milan nobler in name and in race ;.
Never was lady of Italy fairer to see in the face.

Never was lady on earth more true as woman and wife,

Larger in judgment and instinct, prouder in manners

and life.

THE~ STAG OF CLANRUADH.
GEORGE MACDONALD.

For a sketch of the life of George MacDonald see “ Cyr’s Fourth Reader.”

AMONG the peasantry assembled at the feast were

‘two that had neither danced nor seated themselves at

the long table where all were welcome. The elder was
a man about ﬁve and ﬁfty, tall and lean, with a wiry
frame, dark grizzled hair, and a shaven face. His eyes
were remarkably clear and keen, and the way he used
them could hardly fail to attract attention. Although
everybody spoke to him, he never spoke in reply — only
made signs, sometimes with his lips, oftener with hand
or head; the man was deaf and dumb. '

His companion was a youth whose age it would have
He looked a lad, and was not
far from thirty. The relation between the two was
strangely interesting. Day, and night they were insep-
arable. Because the father was deaf, the son gave all
his attention to the sounds of the world ; his soul sat in
his ears, ever awake, ever listening.

What his people thought of him came out in the
name they gave him: “ Rob of the Angels.” Some
said he always looked cold; but l”think that came of
the wonderful peace on his face, like the quiet of a
lake over which lies a thin mist. Never was stronger
nor fuller devotion manifestedby son to father than by
Rob of the Angels to Hector of the Stags.

The father trusted his son’s hearing as implicitly as  

his own sight. When he saw a certain look come on
his face he would drop on the instant and crouch as
still as if he had ears, watching Rob’s face for news of
some sound wandering through the vast of night.

He had the keenest eyes in Clanruadh and was a
dead shot. Even the Chief was not his equal. Yet he
never stalked a deer, never killed anything for mere
sport. What the two wanted for food they would kill ;
but it was not much they needed, for seldom can two
men have lived on less.

Two young men of wealth, named Sercombe and
Palmer, had come to the country to hunt. They had
neither experience nor trustworthy attendants; none
of the Chief’s men would hunt with them. Neither
had shot a single stag and the time was drawing near
when they should return. To have no proof of prowess
to display was humbling to Sercombe ; he must show

a stag’s head or hide his own! He resolved, by him- a

self, one of the next moonlit nights, to stalk a certain
great, wide-horn stag of whose habits he had received
information. o C ’ '

His sole attendant when shooting was a clever vaga-
bond lad, called Christian. From him he heard of the
great stag and the spots in the valley which he fre-

quented, often scraping away the snow with his feet to _

get the grass. The lad did not inform him that the
animal was a special favorite with the Chief of Clan-

—>>81638<"

ruadh, or that the clan looked upon him as their live.
symbol, the very stag represented upon. their coat of

arms.
Christian and Sercombe had stalked him day after
day, but without success. And now, with one poor

by night. To despoil him of his life, his glorious rush
over the mountain-side, to see that ideal of strength,
suppleness, and joyous ﬂight lie nerveless and placid
at his feet, was for the time the ambition of Halary
Sercombe. .

There was, however, a reason for the failure of the
young hunters beyond lack of skill and what they called
their ill luck. Hector of the Stags Was awake; his keen
eye was upon them, seconded by the ,all-hearing ears of

Rob of the Angels. They had discovered that the two

men had set their hearts on the big stag, and every time
they were out after him Hector, too, was out with his
spyglass, the gift of an old seafaring friend, searching
the billowy hills. s f "

While the hunters would be toiling along toget wind
of him unseen, for the old stag’s eyes were as keen as
his velvety nose, the father and son would be lying,

remaining hope, the latter had determined to stalk him ,

10

perhaps close at hand, perhaps far away, on some hill- .

side of another valley, watching now the hunters, now
the stag.   v

For love of the Chief and for love of the stag they  

had constituted themselves his guardians. Again and

again, when one of the hunters had him within range, .

quietly feeding, naught between the great pumping of

his big joyous heart and the hot bullet but the brown’

‘skin, a distant shot would forestall the nigh one, a shot

for life, not death; and the stag, knowing instantly, by
wondrous combination of sense and judgment, in what

quarter lay the danger, Would, without once looking
around him, measure a hundred yards of hillock and
rock between the sight-taking and the pulling of the
trigger. .
Another time it would be no shot, but the bark of a
dog, the cry of a moor fowl, or a signal from some

. watching hind that started him.

The sounds that warned the stag were by no means
always uttered by other animals. They were often but
imitations by Rob of the Angels. Not‘ a moment did
the stag neglect any warning, but from peaceful feeder
was changed to wind-like ﬂeer, his great horns thrown
back upon his shoulders, and his four legs just touching
the ground with elastic hoof. .

learned that Rob was not by his side. He, too, had
been unable to sleep, and at last discovered that he was
uneasy about something; what, he could not tell. He
rose and went out. The moon was shining, and, as

there was much snow, the night was brighter than

many a day. Hector soon joined his son. He had
brought his telescope and immediately began to sweep

and then he would stop to snuff and search for a mouth-
ful, but was evidently making for one of his feeding
places—most likely that on the Chief’s land. They
did not stop for more than a glance, however, but made
for thevalley as fast as they could walk; the noise of

running feet would be heard too far on such a clear

night. The whole way, without sound uttered, father
and son kept interchanging ideas on the matter.

From thorough acquaintance with the habits of the
animal, they were quite certain he was on his way to
his favorite haunt. If he reached there, he would be
safe; it was the Chief’s ground and no one would dare
to touch him. But he was not yet upon it and was in
danger. If they found him at his usual feed, and dan-
ger threatening, they must scare him eastward; if no
peril was at hand, they would watch him awhile, that

i he might feed in safety.

They approached the castle; immediately beyond that
they would be in sight of the feeding ground. But they
were still behind it when Rob of the Angels bounded
forward in terror at the sound of a gun. His father,

however, who was in front, was off before him. Neither.
, hearing anything, nor seeing Rob, he knew that a shot

had been ﬁred, and, caution being now useless, was in
a moment at full speed. s s

The smoke of the shot hung white in the moonlight
No red bulk shadowed the
green pasture, no thicket of horns went shaking over

‘ stood regarding his work, a tumbled heap of death, yet

saying to himself, “ It is good.”

Rob of the Angels caught it ere it reached his shoulder.

He yielded, and with another roar like a lion bounded

bare-handed upon the enemy. _ A
It was not merely that the enemy had killed the

great stag of their love ; he had killed him on the

Chiefs own ground, under the eyes of the man whose
business it was to watch over him. Itiwas an insult
as well as a wrong to his Chief. In the ﬁerce’ majesty
Ser-
combe met him with a blow straight from the shoulder,

Rob of the Angels, close behindhim, dropped his gun,

his knife ﬂashed pale in the moonlight, and he darted

upon the enemy. It would have gone ill with the bigger
man, for Rob was as lithe as a snake— not only swift
to parry and dodge, but to strike. Sercombe’s arm
would have had at least one terrible gash, had not at
that moment, from the top of the ridge, come the stern
voice of the Chief. Rob’s knife “made lightnings in
the splendor of the moon,” as he threw it from him
and sank down byhis father. Then Hector came to

He;

-->8167B<~-i

.' himself and rose, trembling with excitement, for he saw

the stalwart form of his Chief on the ridge above him.
The Chief had been wakened by the gun, and, at the
roar of his friend Hector, sprang from his bed. But

when he saw his beloved stag dead on his pasture, he

came down the ridge like an avalanche. He gazed

speechless for a moment on the slaughtered stag and
‘ heaved a great sigh.

“ Mr. Sercombe,” he said, “I
would rather you had shot my best horse. Are you
aware, sir, that you are a poacher ?” ' H
“ Ihad supposed the ‘term inapplicable to a gentle-
man,” answered Sercombe with entire coolness. “ I will
pay whatever you choose to set on the brute.” It would
be hard to say which was less agreeable to the Chief, to
have his stag called a brute, or be offered blood money.
“Stag Ruadh priced like a bullock,” he said with as
slow smile, full of sadness; “the pride of every child in
the glen! Not a gentleman in the county would have
shot Clanruadh’s deer.”_  who  
Sercombe was by this time feeling uncomfortable,
and it made him~ angry. He muttered something
about superstition. p I H
"“ He was taken when a calf,” the Chief went‘ on,
"’ and given to a great—aunt of mine ; but when he grew

  up he took to the hills again, and was known by his

silver collar till he managed to rid himself of it. He
shall be buried where he lies, and his monument shall
tell how the stranger served the stag of Clanruadh.” i

PINE TREES.
JOHN RUSKIN.

JOHN RUSKIN was born in London in 1819. He was a bright,
active boy and learned to read when he was four years old. He
amused himself by making little books, printing them by hand,
and illustrating them with his own drawings.  

His parents spent several sum-
mers in driving about England en-
joying the sights and historical
places. John went with them, and
as soon as he could write he kept a
journal. i

Several years later he traveled
with his father through Germany,
sailed across the Italian lakes, and
saw the Alps.

Ruskin was educated at Oxford.
When he was graduated he had
already become well ‘known as a
writer, gained the most popular

university prize, and was considered a clever artist. H
20 ' He became deeply interested in the artists of his time, and

published a number of volumes entitled “Modern Painters.” He

has also written many other works, each containing common
sense and truth, as well as beauty and imagination.
Mr. Ruskin is still living in his delightful home at Brantwood.

charities of fruitfulness. We builders with the sword
have harder work to do for man, and must do it in
close-set troops.     

To stay the sliding of the mountain snows, which
would bury him; to hold in divided drops, at our
sword points, the rain, which would sweep away him

and his treasure ﬁelds ; to nurse in shade among our

brown, fallen leaves the tricklings that feed the brooks

in drought; to give massive shield against the winter

wind, which shrieks through the bare branches of the

. plain, — such service must we do him steadfastly while

we live. p

Our bodies also are at his service; softer than the
bodies of other trees, though our service is harder than
theirs. Let him take them as he pleases for his houses
and ships. , So also it may be well for these timid,’ low-
land trees to tremble with all their leaves, or turn their
paleness to the sky, if but a rush of rain passes by
them; or to let fall their leavesat last, sick and sere.
But we pines must live amidst the wrath of clouds.

We only wave our branches to and fro when the
storm pleads with us, as men toss their arms in a
dream.  

And, ﬁnally, these weak, lowland trees may struggle
fondly for the last remnant of life, and send up feeble
saplings again from their roots when they are   cut
down. But we builders with the sword perish boldly;
our-dying shall be perfect and solemn, as our warring ;
we give up our lives without reluctance, and forever. i

% OYR’S FIFTH. READER  

*>81708<~

I wish the reader to ﬁx his attention for ajmoment

_ on these two great characters of the pine, its straight-

10

ness and rounded perfectness; both wonderful, and in ‘

their issue lovely. I say ﬁrst its straightness. . Because

we see it in the wildest scenery, we are apt to remem- ”

ber only as examples of it those which have been dis-
turbed by violent accident or disease.

Of course such instances are frequent. The_soil of

the pine is subject to continual change; perhaps‘ the

rock in which it is rooted splits in frost and falls for-
ward, throwing the young stems aslope, or the whole
mass of earth around it is undermined by rain, or a

huge boulder falls on its stem from above, and forces if

it for twenty years to grow with weight of several tons
leaning on its side. W _
Nevertheless this is not the truest or universal

expression of the ,pine’s character. The pine rises in
‘serene resistance, self-contained ; nor can I ever with-

out awe stay long under a great ‘Alpine cliff, looking
up to its great companies of pine.

You cannot reach them; those trees never heard
human voice; they are far above all sound but that of
the winds. N 0 foot ever stirred fallen leaf of theirs. .

V Then note, farther, their perfectness. The pine

T stands compact, like one of its own cones, slightly

curved on its sides, and instead of being wild in its
expression, forms the softest of all forest scenery. For
other trees show their trunks and twisting boughs;
but the pine, growing either in luxuriant mass or in

->81718<"

happy isolation, allows no bough -to be seen. Lowland
forests arch overhead and schequer the ground with
darkness; but the pine, growing in scattered groups,
leavesthe glades between emerald bright. Its gloom
is all its own; narrowing to the sky, it lets the sun-
shine strike down to the dew.   I

And then I want you to notice in the pine its exqui-
site ﬁneness. Other trees rise against the sky in dots
and knots, but this in fringes. , .

You never see the edges of it, so subtle are they;
and for this reason it alone of trees, so far as I know,
is capable of the ﬁery changes noticed by Shakespeare.

When the sun risesbehind a ridge crested with pine,

10

provided the ridge be at a distance of about two miles, n

and seen clear, all the trees for about three or four
degrees on each side of the sun become trees of light,
seen in clear ﬂame against the darker sky, and dazzling
as the sun itself. a

I thought at first this was owing to the actual luster
of the leaves; but I believe now it is caused by the
cloud—dew upon them, every minutest leaf carrying its
diamond. It seems as if these trees, living always
among the clouds, had caught part of their glory from
them. a

ASPECT OF THE PINES.
g _; PAUL HAMILTON HAYNE.

PA‘H.L HAMILTON HAYNE, a Well-known Southern poet, Was
born in Charleston, S. C., in 1830.

His verses are ﬁlled with pictures of nature in the South and _

the lessons revealed to his poetic mind. He died in 1886.

V TALL, somber, grim, against the morning sky
They, rise, scarce touched by melancholy airs,
Which stir the fadeless foliage dreamfully,
As if from realms of mystical despairs.

Tall, somber, grim, they stand With dusky gleams
Brightening to gold Within the vvoodland’s core,
Beneath the gracious noontide’s tranquil beams —
But the Weird Winds of morning sigh no more. .

A stillness strange, divine, ineffable,

Broods round and o’er themiin the Wind’s surcease,
And in each tinted copse and shimmering dell
Rests the mute rapture of deep-hearted peace.

Last sunset comes — the solemn joy— and night
Born from the nest When cloudless day declines-—
Lovv, ﬂutelike breezes sweep the Waves of light,
And liftingdark green tresses of the pines,

Till every lock is luminous, gently ﬂoat,
Fraught with pale odors up the heavens afar,
To faint when twilight on her virginal throat A
Wears for a gem the tremulous vesper star.

WORK.
JOHN RUSKIN.

IT is physically ‘iinpossible for a well-educated,
lectual, or brave man to make money the chief offject
of his thoughts; as ‘physically impossible as it is for
him to make‘  dinner the principal object of them.
All healthy people like their dinners, but their dinner

, is notthe main object of their lives. So all healthily

minded people like making money——ought to like it,

‘and to enjoy the sensation of Winning it ; but the main

object of their life is not money; it is something bette

’ A good soldier, for instance, mainly Wishes to do his
ﬁghting Well. He is glad of his pay-——very properly
so, and justly grumbles When you keep him ten years
Without it; still, his main notion of life is to Win
battles, not to be paid for Winning them.  

So of doctors. They like fees no doubt—ought to
like them; yet if they are brave and Well educated, the
entire object of their lives is not fees, They, on the

f Whole, desire to cure the sick; and—if they are good
* doctors, and the choice Were fairly put to them—

iwould rather cure their patient and lose their fee than
kill him and get it.‘ And so with all other brave and

rightly trained men; their Work is ﬁrst, their fee
second; very important always, but still second.
‘But in every nation, as Isaid, there are a vast class

who are cowardly, and more or less stupid. And with
these people, justas certainly the fee is ﬁrst and the
work second, as With brave people the work is ﬁrst and
the fee second.

5 And this is no small distinction. It is the whole
distinction in a man. You cannot serve two masters;
you must serve one or other. If your work is ﬁrst with
you, and yourfee second, work is your master.

Observe then, all wise work is mainly threefold in

10 character. It is honest, useful, and cheerful. I hardly
know anything more strange than that you recognize
honesty in play, and you do not in work. In your
lightest games you have always some one to see what
you call. “fair play.” In boxing, you must hit fair;

15 in racing, start fair. Your watchword is fair play;

- your hatred, foul play. Did it ever strike you that
you wanted another watchword also, fair work, and
another hatred also, foul work? i

THE MARCH, OF THE MARSEILLAIS.

WHAT an uproar! The whole square, blazing with
sunlight, was crammed full of people, all talking and
shouting and gesticulating at once, while the National

Guard was forming in line. No one seemed to know

what had happened.  

“ What is it all about?” I asked.

“ What is it all about?” repeated one of the soldiers.
We are betrayed
by our king. The Marseilles battalion is on its way to
Paris. It will pass through Avignon. . We are going
to welcome these brave patriots.”

10

Scarcely were we in line when a number of children i

“ Here they are !
Here they are I ”

And then, around the turn of the road, bravein their
red plumed cocked hats, appeared the leaders of the
Marseilles battalion, while all the men together burst
forth with : —

“ Forward, forward, countrymen!
The glorious day has come!”

It was the “Marseillais” that they were singing;
and that magniﬁcent hymn, heard then igr the ﬁrst
time, stirredhus down to the very marrow of our bones.

On they came, and what a sight it was! Fiveg,.hun-
dred men sunburnt- as locust beans, with black eyes

blazing like live coals under bushy eyebrows, all white‘

’ with the dust of the road. They wore green cloth

10

coats turned back with red _like mine. Some wore

cocked hats with waving feathers; some, red liberty

caps with the strings ﬂying back over their shoulders.
Each man had stuck in the barrel of his gun a wil-

low or a poplar branch to shelter him from the sun,

and all this shrubbery cast dancing shadows over their

faces that made them look still more fantastic and

strange.  
And when from all those red mouths—wide open

  as a wolf’s jaws, with teeth gleaming white like a wild

15

20

25

beast’s teeth —— burst forth the chorus, “ To arms, citi-
zens I” itfairly made a shiver run down one’s spine.

T The whole battalion passed onward and was swal-
lowed up in the city gate. Then came four men, haul-
ing after them a rusty truck, on which was a cannon.
These men were harnessed to the truck as oxen to the
plough, and, like oxen, pulled from head and shoulders.
With every muscle at full stretch they bent forward
to their heavy task. Following the truck came another
and still another. Grasping though the men were for
breath, yet they too raised their heads and shouted as
they passed through our ranks : —

“ To arms citizens to arms!”
7 9

Day was dawning as we began our march with the

‘ battalion, and soon we were on the highroad under a

blazing sun, kicking up the dust like twenty ﬂocks of
sheep and making our throats as dry as limekilns.

A open, so as to look ﬁerce and dangerous.

In spite of heat and dust, in spite of thirst and
weariness, no one complained as we tramped steadily
on; one body and one soul, with one will and one aim
—and that to make the traitor king and those Parisians
who were traitors with him cry mercy.

At midday we reached Orange, where the whole
town came to meet us. I can tell you I was a proud
boy as I entered that town! From my shoes to my
eyebrows I was wl1ite with dust. My red cap was
cocked over one ear. I kept my eyes glaringly wide
I howled

but me!  

Hours went by; onward we marched through .the
black night. Oh, how long was that night and how
weary that road! We were too tired to talk. The
only sounds we heard were the rumbling of the cannon
on the road and the chirping of the crickets in the ﬁelds.

At last we came to a Village just as the dawn began
to whiten the sky. On the straw of some threshing-
ﬂoors we laid ourselves down for an hour’s sleep. At
sunrise we were in line again.
- This time I stationed myself in the rear, beside the
cannon. A tremendous longing to help pull the guns
had taken hold of me; for I thought that if only I
could be harnessed‘ up with the others I would not
seem so young.‘ I fancied to myself how I would look

would take a twig and help him _on his way; putting
the twig under him Very gently so as not to hurt him,
and so lifting him over a hard pass that would have
cost him an hour of climbing to cross alone. And so
the afternoon wore away.

We marched all night. Now we were coming to the
frontiers of the north. There were no more olive trees,
and the soft sea wind of the Mediterranean was far
away. But this was only the beginning of the march.

We went steadily on, drinking the water of brooks
and ditches, and taking only snatches of sleep as the
chance came. "

The-“endless road was always the same long, weary
way.’ Footsore, hungry, weary, still we toiled on.
Some of the men began to drag behind, limping on
bleeding feet; but they struggled bravely along. To
drown the murmurs of pain, which even the best of
them could not wholly stiﬂe, we sang the “ Marseillais.”

And at last, after days of weariness and hunger and
thirst, we saw on the edge of the green plain the
towers and spires of Paris.  

A great crowd followed us into the city, drawn on
partly by the steady roll of the drums, but more

strongly by the terrible chant of the “ Marseillais,”

which all the ﬁve hundred men of the battalion sang
in one tremendous voice. Soon the crowd caught the
words bf the chorus and sang with us—and then it
was no longer ﬁve hundred, but a thousand, ten thou-
sand, twenty thousand singers, singing with one voice.

I sang as if I would tear my throat open. From

20

time to time I would look back to see the overwhelm- “

ing, howling, terrible ﬂood of people pouring in close
behind us. Our weeks and weeks of marching were
over. It seemed as".if a great “mountain were gallop-
ing after us with its peaks and valleys and forests
shaken and riven by the avalanche, the tempest, the
earthquake of “God !. .

THE LADY OF SHALOTT.

ALFRED TENNYSON.

For a sketch of the life of Alfred Tennyson, see “ Cyr’s Fourth Reader.”

PART I.

ON either side the river lie

Long ﬁelds of barley and of rye,

That clothe the Wold and meet the sky;

And through the field the road runs by
To many-towered Camelot;

And up and down the people go,

Gazingwhere the lilies blow

Round an island there below,
The island of Shalott.

»>a18.18<~

Willows whiten, aspens quiver,
Little breezes dusk and shiver,
Through the wave that runs forever,
By the island in the river

Flowing down to Camelot.
Four gray-walls and four gray towers,
Overlook a space of ﬂowers,

And the silent isle embowers
The Lady of Shalott.

By the margin, willow-veiled,
Slide the heavy barges trailed
By slow horses ; and unhailed,
The shallop ﬂitteth silken-sailed,

Skimming down to Camelot:

But who hath seen her wave her hand?
Or at the easement seen her stand?

Or is she known in all the land,
The Lady of Shalott?

Only reapers, reaping early
In among the bearded barley,
Hear a song that echoes oheerly
From the river winding clearly,
Down to towered Camelot:

And by the moon the reaper weary,

Piling sheaves in uplands airy,  
Listening, whispers, “ ’T is the fairy
Lady of Shalott.”

——>81828<-

PART II.

There she weaves by night and day
A magic Web With colors gay.
She has heard a Whisper say,
A curse is on her if she stay
To look down to Camelot.

i She knows not What the curse may be,

And so she Weaveth steadily,
And little other care hath she,
The Lady of Shalott.

And moving through a mirror clear
That hangs before her all the year,
Shadows of the World appear.

There she sees the highway near

Winding down to Camelot:

There the river eddy Whirls,

And there the surly Village-ehurls,

And the red cloaks of market-girls,

T Pass onward from Shalott.

Sometimes a troop of damsels glad,
An abbot on an ambling pad,
Sometimes a curly shepherd-lad,
Cr long-haired page in crimson clad,

_ Goes by to toWered Camelot;
And sometimes through the mirror blue
The knights come riding two and two:

4818386-

She hath no loyal knight and true,

The Lady of Shalott.

But in her Web she still delights
To Weave the mirror’s magic sights,
For often through the silent nights
A funeral, with plumes and lights,
And music, went to Camelot:
Or When the moon Was overhead
Came two young lovers lately Wed ;
“ I am half sick of shadows,” said
The Lady of Shalott.

PART III.

A boW-shot from her bower-eaves,
He rode between the barley—sheaVes,
The sun came dazzling through the leaves,
And ﬂamed upon the brazen greaves
A Of bold Sir Lancelot.
A red-cross knight forever kneeled
To a lady in his shield, ,
That sparkled on the yellow ﬁeld,
Beside remote Shalott.

The gemmy bridle glittered free,
Like to some branch of stars We see
Hung in the golden Galaxy.

,The bridle bells rang merrily,

As he rode down to Camelot:

->8184-B<-

And from his blazoned baldric slung
A mighty silver bugle hung,
And as he rode his armor rung,
S Beside remote Shalott.

His broad clear brow in sunlight glowed ;
On burnished hooves his war-horse trode ;
From underneath his helmet ﬂowed
His coal black curls as on he rode,
As he rode down to Camelot.
From the bank and from the river
He ﬂashed into the crystal mirror,
“ Tirra lirra,” by the river
Sang Sir Lancelot.

She left the web, she left the loom,
She made three paces through the room,
She saw the water—lily bloom,

She saw the helmet and the plume,

r She looked down to Camelot.
Out ﬂew the web and ﬂoated wide ;
The mirror cracked from side to side 3
“ The curse is come upon me ! ” cried

The Lady of Shalott.

PART IV.

In the stormy east wind straining,
The pale yellow woods were waning,
The broad stream in his banks complaining,

~>a1s5-3<—-

Heavily the low sky raining

Over towered Camelot ;
Down she cameand found a boat
Beneath a willow left aﬂoat,
And round about the prow she wrote

The Lady of Shalott.

And down the riVer’s dim expanse-
Like some bold seer in a trance,
Seeing all his own mischance -——A
With a glassy countenance,
Did she look to Camelot.
And at the closing of the day
She loosed the chain, and down she lay;
The broad stream bore her far away, A
The Lady of Shalott.

Lying, robed in snowy white

That loosely ﬂew to left and right -
The leaves upon her falling light —
Through the noises of the night

She ﬂoated down to Camelot:

And as the boat-head wound along

The willowy hills and ﬁelds among,

They heard her singing her last song,
The Lady of Shalott.

Heard la carol, mournful, holy,
Chanted loudly, chanted lowly,
Till her blood was frozen slowly,

-—>81868*~

And her eyes Were darkened wholly,
Turned to towered Camelot.
For ere she reached upon the tide
The ﬁrst house by the water-side,
Singing in her song she died,
  The Lady of Shalott.

Under tower and balcony,

By garden-wall and gallery,

A gleaming shape she ﬂoated by,
Dead-pale between the houses high,

Silent into Camelot.

Cut upon the wharves they came,
Knight and burgher, lord and dame,
And round the prow they read her name,

The Lady of Shalott.

Who is this? and what is here?

And in the lighted palace near

Died the sound of royal cheer;  

And they crossed themselves for fear :

b All the knights at Camelot:

But Lancelot mused a little space;

He said, “ She has a lovely face ;

God in his mercy lend her grace,
The Lady of Shalott.”

JOHN LOTHROP MOTLEY.

JOHN LOTHROP MOTLEY was born in Dorohester,
now a part of Boston, Mass, on the 15th of April,
1814. His parents belonged to old New England
families, and John never tired of hearing their stories
of the early settlers. His great-grandfather was killed
by the Indians, and his
grandmother, who was a
little child at the time of
the attack, would have
lost her life or been taken
prisoner, if the maid ser-
vant had not hidden her
under a large tub in the
cellar.

John was a bright boy,
truthful, and with a quick
sense of honor. He was
Very fond of reading and
was seldom seen without a book in his hand. He had a
talent for deolaiming, and one of his younger brothers
remembers being wrapped in a shawl, and kept quiet
with sweetmeats, to represent the dead Caesar, while
John delivered the speech of Antony over his body.

His father’s house was a large, homelike dwelling,
and the ohildren were allowed the freedom of the garret
and garden. Many a treasure was stowed away in
trunks under the eaves, and John and his playfellows,

20

-—>81888<~

H among them Wendell Phillips, who afterward became a

10

.15

20

25

famous orator, often arrayed themselves in long cloaks
and plumed hats, and acted plays or scenes from history.

John was sent to school at Northampton when he
was about ten years old. He was a brilliant scholar
and gained a great reputation among the boys because
of his ability to declaim. One of his teachers was
George Bancroft, the historian, who little thought that
his clever pupil would some day rank with himself as
an author.

At the age of thirteen, the future historian entered
Harvard College. He was the youngest member of his
class, and his reputation as a scholar and his handsome
person attracted much attention. During his ﬁrst year
in college, young Motley held the second or third 'rank
in his class. He led a very pleasant life, receiving his
friends in his handsomely furnished room, roaming about
the old, historic town, and spending his leisure time in
reading and writing sketches and poems for his own
amusement. B

After completing his college course, he went to Ger-
many and spent two years at the Universities of Berlin
and Gottingen. One of the friends made at this time
Was Prince Bismarck, who was one of his fellow-
students at Gottingen. The two young men lodged in
the same house and spent much time together. d

On his return to America, Motley studied law. He
was married when he was twenty-three to Mary Ben-

jamin, and two years later his ﬁrst work, a novel called

->81898<"

A “ Morton’s Hope,” was published. A This book contains

many scenes drawn from the life of the author.

In 1841 Mr. Motley was sent by the government to

ﬁll an oﬂice in Russia. He spent several months in
St. Petersburg, but found the climate so trying that
he was unwilling to take his family to that country,
so resigned his position and returned to America.
Mr. Motley’s ﬁrst historical work was an article on

“Russia” and “Peter the Great,” which appeared in
. the “ North American Review.”

It was a brilliant essay
and gave the author a place among the foremost writers
of the day. .

After the success of this article, Mr. Motley deter-
mined to devote his time to historical writing, and he
began reading for a history of the Dutch Republic.
Meanwhile his second novel, “ Merry-Mount,” had been
published. This was a romance of the Massachusetts
Colony, and received more attention than the story of
“ Morton’s Hope.”

After working for several years on the Dutch his-
tory, Mr. Motley decided that in order to make his
work complete he must consult the libraries of Europe.

He took his family abroad, and started his work
anew, visiting the scenes which he was describing, and
searching in the libraries for old letters and documents.
He so lived in hiswork that to his imagination, Brussels
seemed peopled with the kings and heroes of bygone
days.

For ten years he labored upon this history, and then

ARBACES AND THE LION.
i EDWARD BULWER LYTTON.

THE following selection is taken from “ The Last ‘Days of

- Pompeii,” a famous novel written by Edward Bulwer Lytton,

the author of a large number of works of ﬁction.

Arbaces, an Egyptian, murdered Apaecides, a priest, and .
accused Glaucus, a young Greek, of having committed the. crime. 5
Calenus witnessed the deed, and Arbaces, after promising him a
large sum for his silence, imprisoned him in a dungeon, leaving
him there to die. i

Grlaucus was condemned, and, according to the ancient cus-t
tom, was to be devoured by the lions; but Calenus escaped and 10
accused Arbaces of the crime.

The terrible eruption.of Mt. Vesuvius burst forth just as the
crowd rushed upon Arbaces, and the city of Pompeii was buried
beneath its fury. Grlaucus and some of his friends escaped, but
Arbaces perished. - ‘ 15

s THE keeper, who was behind the den, cautiously re-
moved the grating; the lion ‘leaped forth with a mighty
and a glad roar of rel_e_ase. A Grlaucus had bent his ‘limbs

r so as to give himself the ﬁrmest pos_t_ure at the expected

published it at his own expense, for he could ﬁndno
publisher Willing to undertake so large a Work.

The book Was Widely read and highly praised. It
Was reprinted in New York and translated into several
languages, _and the author, Who had almost forgotten

living men in his close study of historical characters,
«found himself the object of every attention. “

Motley Was forty years.of age When “ The Rise of
the Dutch Republic” Was published. He spent the

next Winter in this country, enjoying its social life, and r

then returned to England, Where he Was received With
He was a Welcome guest in the best
houses, and the kindness and pleasure With which he
Was received added much to his happiness.

He again devoted himself to study, and in four years
the ﬁrst part of his second historical Work, “ The His-
tory of the United Netherlands,” was published. It in-
creased the reputation gained by the ﬁrst history. The
last volumes of this Work were not published until
eight years later. i

Mr. Motley was a true American. When the Civil
War broke out he Was deeply interested in the Wel-
fare of his country and returned to the United States.
He Was appointed Minister to Austria, Which position
he held for six years, making his home in Vienna.
During this time he met his old friend, Bismarck.
Motley’s daughter Writes of their meeting: -

“ Bismarck dined With us twice during his short stay,

and Was most delightful and agreeable. When he and  

-#81919!-'

my father Were together they seemed to live over the
youthful days they had spent together as students, and
many Were the anecdotes of their boyish frolics Which
Bismarck related.”

After resigning his ofﬁce in Vienna, Motley returned
to America, and two years later Was sent as Minister to
England, remaining there one year.

He then devoted his time to literary Work, and Wrote
the life of John of Barneveld, Advocate of Holland.
In order to search for material for this Work he took
his family to The Hague, Where the Queen of Holland

had made ready a house for him. He completed this Q _
A Work; but it Was his last, for his health Was failing,

and after the death of his Wife in 1874 he laid aside
his pen. ~

Mr. Motley’s last days Were spent in England.’ He
died in that country in May, 1877.

THE ABDICATION OF CHARLES V.

JOHN LOTHROP MOTLEY.

ON the twenty-ﬁfth day of October, 1555, the estates
of the Netherlands were assembled in the great hall of
the palace at Brussels. They had been summoned to

be the Witnesses and the guarantees of the abdication .

which Charles V. had long before resolved upon, and
which he Was that day to execute.

The palace Where the states-general Were upon this
occasion convened Was a spacious and convenient build-
ing. In front was a large, open square, enclosed by an

iron railing; in the rear an extensive and beautiful

park, ﬁlled With forest trees, and containing gardens

and labyrinths, ﬁsh ponds and game preserves, .foun- '

tains and promenades, race courses 5 and archery
grounds. -

The main entrance to this ediﬁce ‘opened upon a
spacious hall, connected with a beautiful chapel. The
hall Was celebrated for its size, harmonious proportions,
and the richness of its decorations. At the Western end
a spacious platform, or stage, with six or seven steps,
had been constructed. In the center of the stage Was a
splendid canopy, decorated with the arms of Burgundy,

‘beneath which were placed three gilded armchairs. The

theater Was ﬁlled —'—— the audience Was eager with expec-
tation —the actors Were yet to arrive.

As the clock struck three, the hero of the scene
appeared. Caesar, as he was always designated in the

  and with the governors.

-2819330-H

classic language of the day, entered, leaning on the
shoulder of William of Orange. They came from the
chapel and were immediately followed by Philip II. and
Queen Mary of Hungary, and other great personages
came afterward, accompanied by a glittering throng.
All the company present had risen to their feetas
the Emperor entered. By his command all immediately
afterward resumed their places. The benches at either
end of the platform were accordingly ﬁlled with the

« royal and princely personages invited, with the Fleece

Knights, with the members of the three great councils,
The Emperor, the King, and
the Queen of Hungary were left conspicuous in the
center of the scene. .
Charles V. was then ﬁfty-ﬁve years old, but he was
already decrepit with premature old age. Broad in the
shoulders, deep in the chest, very muscular in the arms
and legs, he had been able to match himself with all
competitors in the tourney and the ring, and to van-
quish the bull with his own hand in the favorite national
amusement of Spain. He had been able in the ﬁeld to

do the duty of captain and. soldier, to endure fatigue

and exposure, and every privation except fasting.
These personal advantages were now departed.
Crippled in hands, knees, and legs, he supported
himself with diﬂiculty upona crutch, with the aid of
an attendant’s shoulder. In face he had always been
extremely ugly. His hair was white with age, close-
clipped and bristling; his beard was gray, coarse, and

20

10

A25

-48194-3"’

shaggy. His forehead was spacious and commanding;
the eye was dark blue, with an expression both majestic
and benignant.

So much for the father. The son, Philip II., was a
small, meager man, much below the middle height, with
thin legs, a narrow chest, and the shrinking, timid air
of an habitual invalid.

In face he was the living image ofhis father, having
the same broad forehead and blue eye, with the same
aquiline but better proportioned nose. His demeanor
in public was still, silent, almost sepulchral.

Such was the personal appearance of the man who
was about to receive into his single hand the destinies
of half the world; whose single will was, for the future,
to shape the fortunes of every individual then present,
of many millions more in Europe, America, and at the
ends of the earth, and of countless millions yet unborn.

The three royal personages being seated upon chairs
placed triangularly under the canopy, such of the audi-
ence as had seats provided for them now took their

places and the proceedings commenced. Philibert de '

Bruxelles, a member of the council of the Netherlands,
arose at the Emperor’s command and made a long ora-
tion. He spoke of the Emperor’s warm affection for
the provinces, of his deep regret that his broken health
and failing powers compelled him to resign his sover-
eignty and to seek relief for his shattered frame in
a more genial climate. He rejoiced, however, that his
son was both vigorous and experienced, and that his

~+a1958<~ 

recent marriage with the Queen of England had fur- 

nished the provinces with a most valuable alliance. He
concluded with a tremendous exhortation to Philip on
the necessity of maintaining religion in its purity.
After this the councilor proceeded to read the deed
of cession by which Philip, already sovereign of Sicily,
Naples, Milan, and titular king of England, France,
and Jerusalem, now received all the Burgundian
property, including, of course, the seventeen Nether-
lands. '

The Emperor then rose to his feet; Supported upon  

his crutch and upon the shoulder of VVilliamof? Qrange,
he proceeded to address the states. T i f ,

As long as God granted him health, he continued,
only enemies could have regretted that Charles was
living and reigning; but now that his strength was but
vanity, and life fast ebbing away, his love for dominion,
his affection for his subjects, and his regard for their
interests required his departure. - .

Turning toward Philip, he observed that for a father
to bequeath so magniﬁcent an empire. to his son was a
deed worthy of gratitude; but that when the father
thus descended into his grave before his time, and by
an anticipated and living burial sought to provide for

the welfare of his realms and the grandeur of his son,

the beneﬁt thus conferred was surely far greater.
Posterity would applaud his abdication should his son
prove worthy of his bounty; and that could only be by

10

living in the fear of God, and by maintaining law and

justice in all their purity as the true foundation of the
realm. i

In conclusion he entreated the estates, and through
them the nation, to render obedience to their new
prince; begging them at the same time to pardon him
all errors or oﬁenses which he might have committed
toward them during his reign, and assuring them that
he should unceasingly remember their obedience and

affection in his every prayer to that Being to whom 7

the remainder of his life should be dedicated.

Sobs were heard throughout every portion of the
As
for the Emperor himself, he sank almost fainting upon
his chair as he concluded his address. An ashy paleness
overspread hiscountenance, and he wept like a child.

Even the icy Philip was almost softened as he rose
to perform his part in the ceremony. Dropping upon
his knees before his father’s feet, he reverently kissed
his hand. Charles placed hishands solemnly upon his
son’s head and blessed him. Then raising him in his
arms he tenderly embraced him, saying as he did so, to
the greatpotentates around him, that he felt a sincere
compassion for the son on whose shoulders so heavy a
weight had just devolved. i  

Philip now uttered a few words expressive of his
duty to his father and his aﬁection for his people.
Turning to the orders, he signiﬁedhis regret that he
was unable to address them either’ in the French or

10

20

25

Flemish language, and was obliged to ask their atten- ,

->8l988<‘-

tion to the Bishop of Arras, who would act as his
interpreter. Antony Perrenot accordingly arose, and
in smooth, ﬂuent, and well-turned commonplaces ex-
pressed at great length the gratitude of Philip toward

his father, with his ﬁrm determination to walk in "the  

path of duty, and to obey his father’s counsels and

» example in the future administration of the provinces.

10

This address was responded to by Jacob Maas, who
had beenselected to reply on the behalf of the states-
general. Queen Mary of Hungary, the regent of the
Netherlands during the past twenty-ﬁve years, then

‘ rose to resign her ofﬁce, making a brief address ex-

pressive of her affection for the people. Again Maas
responded, asserting in terms of fresh compliment and

elegance the uniform satisfaction of the provinces With
her conduct during her whole career.

The orations and replies having now been brought
to a close, the ceremony Was ended. The Emperor,
leaning on the shoulders of the Prince of Orange and
of the Count de Buren, slowly left the hall, followed
by Philip, the Queen of Hungary, and the whole court;
all in the same order in which they had entered, and

by the same passage into the chapel.

LORD BYRON.

LORD BYRON was born in London in 1788. “Then he Was
ten years old he inherited a title of nobility and took possession
of N ewstead Abbey, the ancient family seat near Nottingham.

His early education Was received at private schools, and he
entered Trinity College, Cam-
bridge, When he was seventeen
years of age.

Two years later his iirst vol-
ume of verses, “Hours of Idle.-
ness,” was published. It Was
severely criticised, and the young
poet replied in so savage a poem
that he attracted much attention.

After leaving college, Byron
traveled along the shores of the
Mediterranean, visiting Greece
and Turkey. On his return he
published the first part of “ Childe
Harold,” which is generally con-
sidered his greatest Work. After the publication of this poem he 20
Was recognized as one of the leading poets of England.

Byron took ﬁnal leave of England when he was tWenty—eight,
andlived for several years in Switzerland and Italy, Where he
wrote some famous poems. ,

The cause of Greek independence appealed so strongly to him 25
that he raised a large sum of money, and in the summer of 1823
he sailed to the assistance of the Greeks. He was made com-
mander-in-chief of an expedition, but was taken ill a.nd died on

of his grim foe. But, to the unutterable astonishment
of all, the beast halted abruptly in the arena; then
suddenly it sprang forward, but not on the Athe-

avenue of escape. Once or twice it endeavored to
leap up the parapet that divided it from the audi-

than its deep-toned and kingly roar.. The ﬁrst sur-
prise of the assembly at the apathy of the lion was
soon converted into resentment at its cowardice; and
the populace already merged their pity for the fate
of Glaucus into angry compassion for their own dis-

 Then there was a confusion, a bustle——voices of
remonstrance suddenly breaking forth, and suddenly
silenced at the reply. All eyes turned, in wonder at
the interruption, towards the quarter of the disturbance.
The crowd gave way, and suddenly Sallust appeared
on the senatorial benches, his hair disheveled—breath—
less — heated — half exhausted. He cast his eyes hastily
around the ring. “Remove the Athenian!” he cried,
“ haste—he is innocent! Arrest Arbaces, the Egyptian ;
he is the murderer of Apaecides ! ”

“ Art thou mad, 0 Sallust?” said the praetor, rising at

from his seat. f‘ What means this raving?”

No trace of man.

I saw no bounds on either side;

’T was a wild waste of underwood,
And here and there a chestnut stood,
The strong oak, and the hardy pine;

We rustled through the leaves like wind,
Left shrubs, and trees, and wolves behind;
Where’er we ﬂew they followed on,

Nor left us with the ‘morning sun ;

Behind I saw them, scarce a rood,

At daybreak winding through the wood,
And through the night had heard their feet
Their stealing, rustling step repeat.

Oh! how I wish’d for spear or sword,

At least to die amidst the horde,

‘And perish——if it must be so—

At bay, destroying many a foe!

With ﬂowing tail, and ﬂying mane, _
Wide nostrils, never stretch’d by pain,

THE GENIUS OF A GREAT ARCHITECT.
PHILLIPS BROOKS.

PHILLIPS BROOKS was born in Boston, December 13, 1835. His
college education was received at Harvard, aft er which he studied
theology at the seminary in Alexandria, Va.

After preaching for several years in Philadelphia he removed
to Boston and ﬁlled the ofﬁce of rector of Trinity Church, a
beautiful ediﬁce which was designed by the famous architect,
Henry ‘ H. Richardson. .

Mr. Brooks was one of the most brilliant pulpit orators of his
denomination, and his printed sermons are widely read.

He was offered the position of preacher and professor at Har-
In 1891 he was Inade Bishop of
Massachusetts. His death occurred in January, 1893.

Bishop Brooks was loved and honored throughout England
and America; and memorials to him have been placed in'Lon-
don, at Harvard University, and in several churches.

FROM 187 2 to 1886 — fourteen years — was the great

10

full period of Henry H.,Richardson’s life and work. -

And what years they were’. He had realized his
powers. The ﬁre of distinct genius, indeﬁnable and
unmistakable, was burning brightly. His buildings
opened like ﬂowers out of his life. It is not in my
purpose now to name even his greatest works, or to
describe the order in which they came, but rather to
characterize someof the qualities, both of the man and
of his work, as they showed themselves in those glori-
ous years when——i-all over the country, in Albany and

and in quiet villages, where he made the town hall and
library a perpetual inspiration, and along the railroads,
where he made the station houses bear witness to the
power of art to beautify the most prosaic uses, and in
dwellings, which he ﬁlled with dignity and grace—
everywhere the man genuinely and spontaneously

«blended his own nature with the purposes and material

10

25

of the structures which he built.

The first quality of true genius certainly was in all
that he did. Itwas instinctive and spontaneous. Based
upon thorough study, genuinely expressing great ideas,
it yet was true that there was much in Richardson’s

work of which he gave and could give’ to himself little
or no account as to how it came to pass.

He was not
a man of theories. His life passed into his buildings
by ways too subtle even for himself to understand.

‘ -And so he has done a larger work than he ever delib-
erately resolved to do.
own way, and the style was there.

It is astyle of breadth and simplicity that corre-
sponds with his whole nature. Never somber, because
the irrepressible buoyancy and cheerfulness of his life
are in it; never attaining the highest reach of spiritu-
ality and exaltation, for his own being had its strong
association with the earth, and knew no mystic raptures

or transcendental aspirations; healthy and satisfying.

He simply did his work in his

this is the character of the buildings which he has left
behind him.

He grew simpler as he grew older and greater. He
often seemed to disregard and almost despise detail of
ornament. He loved a broad, unbroken stretch of Wall.

He seemed to count, with Ruskin, “a noble surface of -
stone a fairer thing than most architectural features a

which it is caused to assume.” And yet out of this
simplicity could burst a sumptuousness of design or
decoration all the more captivating and overwhelming
for the simplicity out of which it sprang. I have heard
one of his own profession call him “ barbaric.” It was
that which made his Work delightful, Whoever came
in contact with it felt that the wind blew out of an ele-

rmental simplicity, out of the primitive life and funda-

mental qualities of man. And this great simplicity,
the truthfulness with which he Was himself, made him
the real master of all that his art had ever been, made
it possible for him, Without concealment, to take some
work of other days and appropriate it into Work of his
own, as Shakespeare took an Italian tale and turned it
into Shylock or Othello.

These are the moral qualities of his architecture.
But these qualities every one must feel who stands in
front of one of Richardson’s great buildings; and the
same qualities every man felt Who came to know him.
That is another note of genius.

Work is in the man. So Richardson possessed in him-

self that solidity without stolidity, that joyousness
without frivolity, which his best art expresses.
Nowhere does this identity of Richardson and his
work seem more impressive than in that unique house
5 at Brookline which was at once his workshop and his
home. No one who saw it when it was ﬁlled with his
vitality will ever lose the feeling of how it was all vital,
like a thing that had grown. I
His life was like a great picture full of glowing color.
  10 The canvas on which it was painted was immense. It
lighted all the room in which it hung. It warmed the

SONG OF THE FORGE.

  CLANG, clang! the massive anvils ring;

Clang, clang! a hundred hammers swing. 3

  Like the thunder rattle of a tropic sky,

The mighty blows still multiply;
Clang, clang!
Say, brothers of the dusky brow,
What are your strong arms forging now?

Clang, clang! We forge the colter now, —
The colter of the kindly plough ;
Prosper it, Heaven, and bless our toil!

May its broad furrow still unbind A

To genial rains, to sun and wind,
The most benignant soil!

Clang, clang! Our colter’s course shall be

On many a sweet and sunny lea,
By many a streamlet’s silver tide,

Amid the song of morning birds,

Amid the low of sauntering herds,

Amid soft breezes which do stray

Through woodbine hedges and sweet may,
Along the green hill’s side.

When regal Autumn’s bounteous hand
With widespread glory clothes the land, —
When to the valleys, from the brow

Of each resplendent slope, is rolled

A ruddy sea of living gold, -
We bless —we bless the Plough.

~>a21A13<~

Clang, clang! Again, my mates, What glows
Beneath the ham.mer’s potent blows ?—
Clink, clank! We forge the giant chain
Which bears the gallant Vessel’s strain,
’Mid stormy Winds and adverse tides;
Secured by this, the good ship braves
The rocky roadstead, and the Waves
Which thunder on her sides.  

-.AI1XlOU.S no more, the merchant sees

The mist drive dark before the breeze,
The storm-cloud on the hill ;

Calmly he rests, though far away

In boisterous climes his vessel lay,
Reliant on our skill.

Say on What sands these links shall sleep,
Fathoms beneath the solemn deep;
By Afric’.s pestilential shore, ——-
By many an iceberg, lone and hoar, -
  By many a palmy Western isle,

Basking in Spring’s perpetual smile, —
By stormy Labrador. ‘

Say, shall they feel the vessel reel,
When to the battery’s deadly peal
The crashing, broadside makes reply?

r Or else, as at the glorious Nile,

Hold grappling ships, that strive the While
For death or victory?

-#8212 Be-

Hurrah! Cling, olang! Once more, what glows,
Dark brothers of the forge, beneath
The iron tempest of your blows,
The furnace’s red breath?
Clang, olang! A burning torrent, clear
And brilliant, of bright sparks, is poured
Around and up in the dusky air,
As our hammers forge the sword.

The sword I —a name of dread ; yet when
.Upon the freeman’s thigh ’t is bound,
While for his altar and his hearth,
While for the land that gave him birth,
The war-drums roll, the trumpets sound,
How sacred is it then!

Whenever, for the truth and right,
It ﬂashes in the van of ﬁght, —
Whether in some wild mountain pass,
As that where fell Leonidas, — s
Or on some sterile plain, and stern,
A Marston or a Bannockburn, —
Or ’mid ﬁerce crags and bursting rills,
The Switzer’s Alps, gray Tyrol’s hills,-—"——
Or, as when sank the Armada’s pride,
It gleams above the stormy tide, --
Still, still, whene’er the battle-word
IsLiberty, when men do stand
For justice and their native land,

Then Heaven bless the Sword!   —

ROBERT BURNS.

ROBERT BURNS was born near the town of Ayr,
Scotland, on the 25th day of January, 1759. VVilliam
Burns, “ the brave father, a silent hero and poet,” was
a humble farmer, but he had a thirst for knowledge,

and longed to give his family an education. He often 5

spent his noon hour
in pointing out the
wonders of nature and
imparting to his chil-
dren what little knowl-
edge he had gained.
Robert was sent to
school at Mt. Oliphant
in his sixth year; but
his father’s poverty
gave him little oppor-
tunity for education,
and at the age of thir-
teen he was assisting
in threshing the corn,
and at sixteen was the principal laborer on the farm.
There was an old woman named Betty Davidson
who lived in the family. She had a store of tales and
songs of fairies, ghosts, witches, dragons, and enchanted
towers. Robert used to listen to these weird stories, 25
which had a strong effect upon his imagination. They
fostered his love of poetry, so that when his hands

ing off on deeds of chivalry or indulging in ﬂights of
fancy. p

The Sabbath was the only time for rest in this busy

5 household, and upon that day Robert Burns would be

found wandering alone beside the river Ayr and listen-

ing to the songs of the birds:

“ The simple Bard, rough at the rustic plough,
Learning his tuneful trade from ev’ry bough;
The chanting linnet, or the mellow thrush,
Hailing the setting sun, sweet, in the green thorn bush.”

A storm always ﬁlled his heart with reverence.
Wrote:

“ There is scarcely any earthly object gives me more
——-I do not know if I should call it pleasure, but some-
thing that exalts me—than to walk in the sheltered
side of a Wood or high plantation in a cloudy Winter
day and hear the stormy" wind howling among the
trees and raving over the plain. . . .
the birds, and frequently turned out of my path lest
I should disturb their little songs or frighten them to
another station.” ”

In spite of his long hours of hard Work, Burns became
a great reader.
book of poems, in his pocket to study during his spare
moments, and Wrote: “ I pored over them driving my

cart, or walking to labor, song by song, verse by verse,
carefully noting the true, tender, sublime, or fustian.ﬁ%*

While Whistling along behind the plough or swing-
ing the scythe, he Was humming the songs of his coun-
try, or changing the forms of the ballads which he
wrote at night in his cheerless room. It Was While
ploughing in the ﬁeld that he composed i

“That I for puir auld Scotland’s sake
Some useful plan or book could make
Or sing a song at least.”

Burns had a tender heart and ready sympathy. One
day his plough turned up a ﬁeld mouse in her nest.
The frightened little creature started to run, and one
of the boys was about to kill her when Burns interfered.
The thought that he had broken up this home where
Mousie thought herself safe from the cold of Winter

ﬁlled him with regret, and he Wrote his celebrated

poem, “ To a iMouse,” on this occasion. Another
poem, “ To a Mountain Daisy,” was composed while he
was ploughing a ﬁeld where he had uprooted a daisy
Which was just springing up through the soil.

W His ﬁrst poem of note, “Behind Yon Hills Where

_Lugar Flows,” was Written when Burns was twenty-

two years old. During that year he Went to Irvine to
learn the ﬂax dresser’s trade. “It Was,” he Writes,
“ an unlucky affair. As We were giving a Welcome
to the New Year, the shop took ﬁre and burned to
ashes, and I was left, like a true poet, without a six-
pence.” His father’s failing health and misfortunes
made it necessary for him to return to the farm.

Burns began to be known in the neighborhood
as a-writer of verses, but some of his poems were
received with disapproval, and other circumstances
increased the feeling against him, so that he decided

5 to leave Scotland and sail for Jamaica. To raise
the needful funds, he had six hundred copies of a
volume of his poems printed at Kilmarnock. The
little book sold rapidly, and the poet had twenty
guineas left after paying all expenses. Burns ‘was

10 now ready to leave Scotland, but a letter from a

friend changed the current of his life and kept him
in his native land. +   o

The poet was received with the highest honor at
Edinburgh, where he was invited into the society of the

p 15 men of letters, rank, and fashion. Surely his dream

had come true. He had reached the heart of “Bonnie
Scotland”! Burns has taken the humblest pictures
of Scottish life and breathed a deeper meaning into
them than has ever been dreamed of by ‘poet or
20 artist. He has compared himself to an }Eolian harp
strung to every wind of Heaven, and there seems
to be nothing from the “ wee, modest, crimson—tipped
ﬂower” to Scotland, his dear native land, that he
has not clothed in verse. A second edition of his
25 poems was published during the following year, and
the proceeds of their sale brought the author ﬁve
hundred pounds. ' Soon afterwards Burns married Jean
Armour, to whom he had long been attached, and

settled on a farm at Ellisland, not far from Dumfries.

—~>82173<‘-

When he took possession of the farm Burns asked lit-
tle Betty, the servant, to take the family Bible and a
bowl of salt, and, placing the one on the other, to walk
into the house. This was one of the old customs, and
the poet delighted in such observances. He and his 5
wife followed Betty and began life on this farm.
While here he was appointed Excise officer for the
district, and spent much of his time riding about the

and murmuring his Wayward fancies as he rode along. 10
He often had a half dozen pieces in his mind, and
thought of one or the other as suited his mood. At
this time Burns wrote about a hundred Scottish songs,
for which he received a shawl for his wife, a picture

representing “ The Cotter’s Saturday Night,” and about 15

ﬁve pounds.
In a short time he was obliged to leave thepleasant

farm and remove to a small house at Dumfries, where

+8 218 8+  Svgéywafjg  

he hoped to support his family on his small "increase of

salary as Excise man of that district; but certain polit- 5

ical views madehim unpopular. He became intem-'
5 perate, and his health failed. He decided to try sea
bathing and at ﬁrst imagined that the sea had beneﬁted
him, but on his return home on the 18th of July, 1796,
‘he became very ill and died Within a few days.
The inhabitants of Dumfries started a subscription
10 for the support of the Widow and children of their A
beloved poet, which Was’ increased by contributions
from all over Scotland, and from England also. In
the old churchyard at Dumfries is ,i ;:the mausoleum
built over the poet’s tomb, and aVmonument Was

ence the very Walks Where he loved to muse.

they poured down in the direction of the Egyptian.
The power of the prgtpr was as a reed beneath the
whirlwind. The guards made but a feeble barrier——-
the waves of’ the human sea halted for a moment, to
enable Arbaces to count the exact moment of his
doom! In despair, and in a terror which beat down
even pride, he glanced his eyes over the rolling and
rushing crowd—when, right above them, he beheld a

-strange and awful ap1&_1:ition—he beheld —-and his

craft restored his courage! T

“ Behold»! ” he shouted with a voice of thunder, which

stilled the roar of the crowd; “behold how the gods
protect the guiltless! The ﬁres of the avenging Orcus
burst forth! against the false witness of my accus-
ers !” The eyes of the crowd followed the gesture
of * the Egyptian and beheld with ineffable dismay
a vast vapor shooting from the sumgiit of Vesuvius
in the form of a gigantic pine tree—-—the trunk, black-
ness; the branches, ﬁre.

HISTORY OF OUR FLAG.

THE history of our glorious old ﬂag is of exceeding
interest, and brings back to us a throng of sacred and
thrilling associations. The banner of St. Andrew was
blue, charged With a White saltire or cross, in the form

5 of the letter X, and was used in Scotland as early as
the eleventh century. The banner of St. George Was
White, charged with the red cross, and Was used in
England as early as the first part of the fourteenth
century. By a royal proclamation, dated April 12,

10 1700, these two crosses Were joined together upon the
same banner, forming the ancient national ﬂag of
England. A

It Was not until Ireland, in 1801, Was made a part of
Great Britain, that the present national flag of England,

15 so Well known as the “Union Jack,” was completed.
But it Was the ancient ﬂag of England that constituted

+>32238<~

the basis of our American banner. Various other ﬂags
had indeed been raised at sundry times ‘by our colonial

7 ancestors. But they were not particularly associated

With, or, at least, Were not incorporated into and made
a part of, the destined “Stars and Stripes.” It was
after Washington had taken command of the fresh
army of the Revolution, at Cambridge, that, January
2, 1776, he unfolded before them the new ﬂag of

thirteen stripes of alternate red and White, having.

upon one of its corners the red and White crosses. of
St. George and St. Andrew, on a ﬁeld of blue. And

this was the standard Which was borne into the city  

and was entered by the American army.

Uniting, as it did, the ﬂags of England and America,
it showed that the colonists were not yet prepared to
sever the tie that bound them to the mother country.

A of Boston when it was evacuated by the British troops A

Bythat union of ﬂags they claimed to be a vital and .7
substantial part of the empire of Great Britain, and 7

demanded the rights and privileges which such a rela-
tion implied. Yet it was ‘by these thirteen‘ stripes

20

that they made known the union also of the thirteen /

  colonies, the stripes of White declaring the purity and

innocence of their cause, and the stripes of red giving
forth deﬁance. to cruelty and opposition.

On the 14th day of June, 1777, itwas resolved by
Congress, “ That "the ﬂag of the thirteen United States

be thirteen stripes, alternate red and White, and that

25

the Union be thirteen White stars in the blue ﬁeld.” «

+8224-8*"

This resolution was made public September 3, 1777,‘
and the ﬂag that‘ was ﬁrst made and used in pursuance
of it was that which led the Americans to victory at
Saratoga. Here the thirteen stars were arranged in a

5 circle, as we sometimes see them now, in order better
to express the idea of the union of the states.

, In 1794, there having been two more new states
added to the Union, it was voted that the alternate
stripes, as well as the circling stars, be ﬁfteen in

10 number, and the ﬂag, as thus altered and enlarged,
was the one which was borne through all the contests

- of the War of 1812. But it was thought that the ﬂag
would at length become too large if. a new stripe
should be added with every freshly admitted state.

15 It was therefore enacted, in 1818, that a permanent
return should be made to the original number of
thirteen stripes, and that the number of stars should
henceforth correspond to the growing number of
states. .

20 Thus the ﬂag would symbolize the Union as it might
be at any given period of its history, and also as it was
at the very hour of its birth. It was at the same time
suggested that these stars, instead of being arranged in
a circle, be formed into a single star———a suggestion

25 which we occasionally see adopted. In ﬁne, no particu-
lar order seems now to be observed with respect to the
arrangement of the constellation. It is enough if only
the whole number be there upon that azure ﬁeld— the
blue to be emblematical of perseverance, vigilance, and

-#822584"

justice, each star to signify the glory of the state it
may represent, and the whole to be eloquent forever
of a Union that must be “one and inseparable.”
What precious associationscluster around our ﬂag!
Not alone have our fathers set up this banner in the
name of God over the well-won battleﬁelds of the
Revolution, and over the cities and towns which they

rescued from despotic rule ; but think where also their

descendants have carried it, and raised it in conquest or
protection! Through what clouds of dust and smoke
has it passed——what storms of shot and shell——-what
scenes of ﬁre and. blood! Not only at Saratoga, at

W Monmouth, and at Yorktown, but at Lundy’s Lane

and New Orleans, at Buena Vista and Chapultepec.
It is the same glorious old ﬂag which, inscribed with
the dying words of Lawrence,——“Don’t give up the
ship ! ”—was hoisted on Lake Erie by Commodore
Perry just on the eve of his great naval victory— the
same old ﬂag which our great chieftain bore in triumph
to the proud city of the Aztecs and planted upon the
heights of her national palace. Brave hands raised it
above the eternal regions of ice in the arctic seas, and
have set it up on the summits of the lofty mountains

. in the distant west.

Where has it not gone, the pride of its friends and
the terror of its foes? What countries” and what seas
has it not visited‘?

10

20

Where has not the American citi-~  W W
zen been able to stand beneath its guardian folds and if  
defy the world? With what joy and exultation sea-   

-45-‘; 2268*-

men and tourists have gazed upon its stars and stripes,

read in it the history of their nation’s glory, received

from it the full sense of security, and drawn from it

the inspirations of patriotism! By it how many have
5 sworn fealty to their country!

What bursts of magniﬁcent eloquence it has called
forth from Webster and from Everett! What lyric
strains of poetry from Drake and Holmes! How
many heroes its folds have covered in death! How

10 many have lived for it, and how many have died for
it! How many, living and dying, have said, in their

enthusiastic devotion to its honor, like that young ‘

Wounded sufferer in the streets of Baltimore, “ Oh, the
ﬂag! the Stars and Stripes! ” And Wherever that ﬂag

15 has gone it has been a herald of a better day;.it has

been the pledge of freedom, of justice, of order, of

‘civilization, and of Christianity. Tyrants only have

hated it, and the enemies of mankind alone have

trampled it to the earth. All who sigh for the triumph
20 of truth and righteousness love and salute it.

JOSEPH RODMAN DRAKE.

JOSEPH RoDMAN DRAKE was born in New YorkCity, in 1795.

He Wrote a number of poems which gave promise of his gaining
high rank as a poet; but he died at the age of twenty-four.

WHEN Freedom from her mountain height

Unfurled her standard to the air,
She tore the azure robe of night,

And set the stars of glory there;
She mingled With its gorgeous dyes
The milky baldric of the skies,

And striped its pure, celestial White
With streakings of the morning light;
Then from his mansion in the sun
Sheoalled her eagle-bearer down,

And gave into his mighty hand

The symbol of her chosen land.

Flag of the brave, thy folds shall ﬂy,
The sign of hope and triumph high I
When speaks the signal trumpet tone,
And the long line comes gleaming on
(Ere yet the life-blood, Warm and Wet,
Has dimmed the glistening bayonet)
Each soldier eye shall brightly turn
To Where thy sky-born glories burn,
And as his springing steps advance,

-682283“

Catch war and vengeance from the glance.
And when the cannon-mouthings loud~ , ,
Heave in wild wreaths the battle-shroud,
And gory sabers rise and fall

Like shoots of ﬂame on midnight’s pall,

Then shall thy meteor glances glow,
And cowering foes shall sink beneath

Each gallant arm that strikes below
That lovely messenger of death.

Flag of theseas, on ocean wave

Thy stars shall glitter o’er the brave ;
When death, careering on the gale,
Sweeps darkly round the bellied sail,
And frighted waves rush wildly back
Before the broadside’s reeling rack,
Each dying wanderer of the sea

Shall ‘look at once to Heaven and thee,
And smile to see thy splendors ﬂy

In triumph o’er his closing eye.

Flag of the free heart’s hope and home,

By angel hands to valor given,  
Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,

And all thy hues were born in heaven.
Forever ﬂoat that standard sheet!

Where breathes the foe, but falls before us,
With Freedom’s soil beneath our feet,

And Freedom’s banner streaming o’er us?

i he remained for over thirty years.

DREAM—CHILDREN: A REVERIE.

CHARLES LAMB.

CHARLES LAMB was born in London on the
17 75. .
He was sent to school at Christ’s Hospital when he was eight
years old and remained there for seven years. Charles was a
delicate, sensitive boy, and there
was little in the dull, hard life of
this school to make him happy.
He was fortunate in having Cole-
ridge for a companion, with whom
he formed a lifelong friendship.
After leaving school Lamb held a
clerkship for a short time, and then
entered an accountant’ s office, where

10th of February,

. A terrible sorrow shadowed his
life. His sister Mary became vio-
lently insane and was placed in an
asylum. After the recovery of her health her brother obtained
her release by promising to watch over and care for her.

When Lamb was twenty—one years old, Coleridge included four
of his sonnets in. a collection called “ Poems on Various Subjects.”
These were the first of Lamb’s writings to appear in print. He
afterwards published a number of poems and plays, and, in com-
pany with his sister, wrote the famous “Tales” founded on the
Plays of Shakespeare. _

When. Lamb was about forty—ﬁve years old, he wrote a number
of essays, signing himself “ Elia,” and it is upon these that his
literary fame rests. They are delicate in fancy and sparkle with
wit and humor. He died on the 27th of December, 1834.

At that moment they felt the earth shake beneath
their feet; the walls of the theater trembled; and be-
yond, in the distance, they heard the crash of falling,
roofs. An instant more and the mountain cloud seemed
to roll towards them, dark and rapid, like a torrent. 5

“ BEHOLD ! ” SHOUTED ARBACES.

At the same time it cast forth from its bosom a shower
of ashes mixed with Vast fragments of burning stone!
Over the crushing Vines, over the desolate streets, over
the amphitheater itself, far and wide, with many a
mighty splash in the agitated sea, fell that awful 10
shower! No longer thought the crowd of justice

r~>e23oa<«

  to the ‘conception of _‘a traditionary great-uncle, or a
grandame, whom they never saw. It was in this spirit
that my little ones crept about me the other evening
to hear about their great-grandmother Field, who lived
in a great house in Norfolk (a hundred times bigger
than that in which they and papa lived), which had
been the scene——so at least it was generally believed
in that part of the country—of the tragic incidents
which they had lately become familiar with from the
10 ballad of the “Children in the Wood.” Certain it is
that the whole story of the children and their ‘cruel
uncle was to be seen fairly carved out in wood upon
the chimney-piece of the great hall, the whole story
down to the Robin Redbreast ; till a foolish rich per-
15 son pulled it_down to set up a marble one of modern
invention in its stead, with no story upon it.

Qt

‘ Here Alice put on one of her dear moth.er’s looks, too ‘

tender to be calledupbraiding. ‘Then I went on to
say how good their great-grandmother Field was; how
20 beloved and respected by everybody, though she was
not indeed the mistress of this great house, but had
only the charge of it (and yet in some respects she
might be said to be the mistress of it too) committed
to her by the owner, who preferred living in a newer
25 and more fashionable mansion which he had purchased
somewhere in the adjoining county; but still she lived
in it in a manner as if it had been her own, and kept
up the dignity, of the great house in a sort while she

lived, which afterwards came to decay, and was nearly

>>8281%-

pulled down, and all its old ornaments stripped and
carried away to th.e owner’s other house, where they

  were set up, and looked as awkward as if some one

were to carry away the old tombs they had seen lately
at the Abbey, and stick them up in Lady C.’s tawdry

gilt drawing-room, Here John smiled, as much as to «

say, “That would be foolish indeed.”

And then Iptold how, when she came to die, her
funeral was attended by a concourse of all the poor,
and some of the gentry too, of the neighborhood for
many miles round, to show their respect for her mem-
ory, because she «had been such a good woman ; so good
indeed that she knew all the Psalter by heart, ay, and
a great part of the Testament besides. Here little
Alice spread her hands. Then I told her what a tall,
upright, graceful person their great—grandmother Field
once was; and how in her youth she was esteemed the
best dancer,—-there Alice’s little right foot played an
involuntary movement, till, upon my looking grave, it
desisted,———the best dancer in the country.

Then I told how good she was to all her grandchil-
dren, having us to the great house in the holidays, where
I in particular used to spend many hours by myself in
gazing upon the old busts of the twelve Caesars that had

been emperors of Rome, till the old marble heads would ‘

seem to live again or I to be turned into marble with

1‘ them. Ilow I never could be tired with roaming about

that huge mansion with its Vast empty rooms, with

I their wornout hangings, ﬂuttering tapestry, and carved

oaken panels with the gilding almost rubbed out,—-
sometimes in the spacious, old-fashioned gardens, which
I had almost to myself, unless when now and then a
solitary gardening man would cross me.

How the nectarines and peaches hung upon the
walls without my ever offering to pluck them, because
they were forbidden fruit, unless now and then,—and
because I had more pleasure in strolling about among
the old, 1nelancholy-looking yew trees, or the ﬁrs, and
picking up the red berries, and the ﬁr apples, which
were good for nothing but to look at,—or in lying
about upon the fresh grass with all the ﬁne garden
smells around me,——or basking in the orangery, till I
could almost fancy myself ripening too along with the
oranges and the limes in that grateful warmth, — or in
watching the dace that darted to and fro in the ﬁsh
pond at the bottom of the garden, with here and there

a great sulky pike hanging midway down the water

in silent state, as if it mocked at their impertinent
friskings. I had more pleasure in these busy-idle diver-
sions than in all the sweet ﬂavors of peaches, nectarines,
oranges, and such—like common baits of children.

Here John slyly deposited back upon the plate a
bunch of grapes, which, not unobserved by Alice, he
had meditated dividing with her, and both seemed will-
ing to relinquish them for the present as irrelevant.
Then, in somewhat a more heightened tone, I told how,
though their great-grandmother Field loved all her

grandchildren, yet in an especial manner she might be

->82339¢"

said to love their uncle, John L , because he was so
handsome and spirited a youth, and a king to the rest
of us. Instead of moping about in solitary corners,
like some of us, he would mount the most mettlesome
horse he could get, when but an imp no bigger than
themselves, and make it carry him half over the county
in a morning, and join the hunters when there were
any out,—and yet he loved the old great house and
gardens too, but had too much spirit to be always pent
up within their boundaries, — and how their uncle grew
up to man’s estate as brave as he was handsome, to

_ the admiration of everybody, but of their great-grand-

mother Field most especially; and how he used to
carry me upon his back when I was a lame-footed
boy—for he was a good bit older than me——many
a mile when I could not walk for pain.

‘In after life he became lame-footed too, and I did not
always (I fear) make allowances enough for him when
he was impatient and in pain, nor remember sufficiently
how considerate he had been to me when I was lame-
footed; and how when he died, though he had not yet
beendead an hour, it seemed as if he had died a great
while ago, such a distance there is betwixt life and

10

death; and how I bore his death, as I thought pretty o

well at ﬁrst, but afterwards it haunted and haunted
me; and thoughl did not cry or take it to heart as
some do, and as I think he would have done if I had
died, yet I missed him all day long, and knew not till

25

then how much I had loved him. I missed his kind- *

+8234-84‘-

  ness, and I missed his crossness, and Wished him to be

alive again. ‘  
Here the children fell a-crying and asked if their
little mourning which they had on Was not for Uncle

John, and they looked up, and prayed me not to go A

on about their uncle, but to tell them some stories

. about their pretty dead mother.

10

Then I told how for seven long years, in hope some-
times, sometimes in despair, yet persisting ever, I
courted the fair Alice W n; and, as much as chil-
drencould understand, I explained to them What coy-
ness, and difﬁculty, and denial meant in maidens,—
When suddenly, turning to Alice, the soul of the ﬁrst
Alice looked out at her eyes with such a reality of
representment that I became in doubt which of them
stood there before me, or Whose that bright hair Was.

—While I stood gazing, both the children gradually grew

fainter to my View, receding, and still receding, till
nothing at last but two mournful features were seen in
the uttermost distance, which, without speech, strangely
impressed upon me the effects of speech: “We are
not of Alice, nor of thee, nor are we children at all.

t The children of Alice call Bartrum father. VVe are

nothing; less than nothing, and dreams ” ;—and, im-

25 mediately avvaking, I found myself quietly seated in

my bachelor armchair, Where I had fallen asleep.

THE SHANDON BELLS.
FATHER PROUT.

FRANCIS SYLVESTER MAH'oNY, better known by his pen-name

of Father Prout, was born in Ireland in 1804, and died in Paris ,

in 1866.

He was a contributor of brilliant, witty, and fantastic produc-
tions to the leading periodicals of his time. His poem, “ The 5
Shandon Bells,” is the best known of his productions.

WITH deep affection
  And recollection,
I often think of those Shandon bells,
Whose sounds so wild would, ,

In days of childhood,
Fling round my cradle their magic spells.

On this I ponder
. Where’er I wander,

And thus grow fonder, sweet Cork, of thee;
With thy bells of Shandon,
That sound so grand on

The pleasant waters of the river Lee.

I ’Ve heard bells chiming
Full many a clime in,
Tolling sublime in cathedral shrine,
.While at a glib rate
Brass tongues would Vibrate ;
But" all their music spoke naught like thine:

+>a2368<«

For memory dwelling
On each proud swelling W
Of the belfry knelling its bold notes free,
Made the bells of Shandon
Sound far more grand on
The pleasant waters of the river Lee.

I ’Ve heard bells tolling
Old Adrian’s Mole in,
Their thunder rolling from the Vatican,
And cymbals glorious
Swinging uproarious
In the gorgeous turrets of Notre Dame;

But thy sounds were sweeter
  Than the dome of Peter
Flings o’er the Tiber, pealing solemnly;—
O, the bells of Shandon
Sound far more grand on
The pleasant waters of the river Lee!

Such empty phantom
p I freely grant them ;
But there is an anthem more dear to me,
’T is the bells of Shandon,
That sound so grand on
The pleasant waters of the river Lee.

DON QUIXOTE AND THE LIONS.
MIGUEL DE CERVANTES.

MIGUEL DE CERVANTES was born in the province of New
Castile, Spain, in 1547. He was descended from a noble family,
his grandfather having been a knight of some distinction.

. Cervantes received a good education and soon showed a talent
for writing.

At the age of twenty-one he became a soldier and won glory,

during a sea battle, by rising from a sick-bed and taking com-  
mand of some soldiers at the post of greatest danger, declaring .

his resolve to die ﬁghting for his God and his king, rather than
to remain under shelter and take care of his health.

Some years later, Cervantes was captured by the Algerians
and made a slave; but after ﬁve years of captivity, which he
bore with wonderful heroism, he was ransomed and returned to
Spain, where he rejoined his regiment and distinguished,him-
self.

He left the army when he was about thirty—five years of age,
and engaged in writing poems and plays. Many years of hard-
ship and poverty followed.

His great work “ Don Quixote” was published in 1604, When
he was ﬁfty—seven years old. It was intended to ridicule the
extravagant stories of chivalry which were popular at that time.
This book has been translated into many languages, and although
nearly three hundred years have passed since it was written, it
still. retains its popularity. ' '

Cervantes died at Madrid in 1616, the same year in which
Shakespeare died in England.

THE history relates that when Don Quixote called

out to Sancho Panza, his servant, he was buying some

curds of the shepherds, and being summoned in such
haste to his master he knew not what to do with them;

10

15

20

25

30

»a 238 3+

r . so to prevent their being wasted he poured them into  

the helmet and hurried away to receive the commands
of his master.  
“Sancho,” said the knight, “give me my helmet;
5 for either I know little of adventures, or that which I
descry yonder is one that will oblige me to have recourse
‘ to arms.”‘S
He of h the green riding coat, hearing this, looked on
all sides and could see nothing but a cart coming
10 towards them with two or three small ﬂags, by which
he thought it probable that it was conveying some of
the King’s money.

He mentioned his conjecture to Don Quixote, but i
his only reply was: “Forewarned, forearmed; to be h I

15 prepared is half the victory. I know by experience
that ‘I have enemies both visible and invisible, and
‘I know not when, nor from what quarter, nor at
what time, nor in what shape they may attack me.”

He then took his helmet from Sancho, and without

20 perceiving the contents, clapped it hastily upon his head.
The curds being squeeziediand pressed, the whey began
to run down the face. and beard of the knight to his
great consternation.    S

“ What can this mean, Sancho?” said he ; “ methinks

25 my skull.is softening, or my brains melting, or I sweat
 I If so, it is certainly not through
fear,‘,;,,ibugh. I. verily believe that this will prove a
‘ terribiliiél adventure.” _

Sancho said, nothing but gave him a cloth. Don

-—>82398<+

Quixote took off his helmet to see whatwas so cool
to his head. “By my soul I ” he exclaimed, “ these
are curds which thou hast put here, thou unmannerly
squire!” ‘ .

Sancho replied with much coolness and cunning: “ If
they are curds, sir, I should sooner have put them into
my stomach than into your Worship’s helmet.”

“ Well,” said Don Quixote, “there may be something
in that”; and after having wiped his head, face, beard,

and helmet, again put it on, and ﬁxing himself ﬁrm in
his stirrups, adjusting his sword, and grasping his lance

he exclaimed: “ Now, come what may, I am prepared

_ to encounter the enemy! ”

They were soon overtaken by the cart with the ﬂags,
which was attended only by the driver, who rode upon
one of the mules, and a man sitting upon the cart.

‘Don Quixote planted himself just before them and
said: “ Whither go ye, brethren? What carriage is this?
What does it contain, and what are those banners?”

“The cart is mine,” answered the carter, “and in
it are two ﬁerce lions, which the general of Gran is
sending to court as a present to his Majesty; the ﬂags

belong to our liege, the King, to show that what is in

the cart belongs to him.” .
“And are the lions large ? ” demanded Don Quixote.
“Larger never came from Africa to Spain,” said the
man on the front of the cart; “ I am their keeper, and
in my time have had charge of many lions, but never
of any so’ large as these. Not having eaten to-day,

we must make haste to the place where they are to

Whilst the keeper was unbarring the ﬁrstv grate,
Don Quixote deliberated whether it would be better

aspect.

He therefore .

The ﬁrst thing the creature did was to turn himself
round in the cage, reach out a paw, and stretch him-
self at full length. Then he opened his mouth and
yawned very leisurely; after which he threw out so1ne
half yard of tongue, wherewith he licked and washed
his face. This done, he thrust his head out of the
cage and stared round on all sides with eyes like red-

hot coals; a sight to have struck temerity itself with n

terror! W
Don Quixote observed him with ﬁxed attention, im-
patient for him to leap out of his den, that he might

_ grapple with him and tear him to pieces.

But the generous lion, after having stared about

him, turned his back upon Don Quixote, and calmly

and quietly laid himself down again in his cage.
Upon which Don Quixote ordered the keeper to

give him some blows, and provoke him to come

forth. “That I will not do,” answered the keeper;

“for, should I provoke him, I shall be the first whom I

  “ The greatness of your Worship’s courage is already
suﬂiciently shown; no brave combatant is bound to do

. more than challenge his foe and wait his coming in the

ﬁeld; and if the antagonist fails to meet him, the dis-

- grace falls upon him, ‘while the challenger is entitled to
. the _crown_ of victory.”

I “That istrue,” answered Don Quixote;

door, friend, and give me a certiﬁcate, in the best form
you can, of what you have seen me perform.”

The keeper closed the door, and Don Quixote, hav-
ing ﬁxed the linen cloth with which he‘ had wiped the
curds from his face, upon the end of his lance, began
to hail the troop in the distance, who were still retir-

ing, looking around at every step.

They all stopped, and saw that it was Don Quixote
that made the sign; and their fear in some degree abat-
ing, they ventured to return slowly, till they could dis-
tinctly hear the words of Don Quixote, who continued
calling to them.

When they had reached the cart again, Don Quixote
said to the driver: “ Now, friend, put on your mules
again and proceed on your journey; and, Sancho, give
two crowns to him and the keeper to make them amends
for this delay.”

“ That I will with all my heart,” answered Sancho;
“but what is become of the lions? Are they dead or
alive ?” S T

The keeper then gave an account of the conﬂict,
enlarging to the best of his skill on the valor-of Don
Quixote, atsight of whom the daunted lion would not
or durst not stir out of his cage, though he held open
the door a good while; and upon his representing to
the knight that it was tempting God to provoke the
lion and force him out, he had, at length, very reluc-
tantly permitted him to close it.

Sancho gave the gold crowns; the carter yoked his

—~>824-38<+

mules ; the keeper thanked Don Quixote for his present,
and promised to relate this Valorous exploit to the King
himself When he arrived at court. A

“If, perohanoe, his Majesty,” said Don Quixote,
“should inquire Who performed it, tell him the
knight of the lions; for henoeforward I resolve that
the title I have hitherto borne, of the knight of the
sorrowful ﬁgure, shall be thus changed, and herein

I follow the ancient practice of knights-errant, Who

changed their names at pleasure.”

laugh broke on his ear. And there, among the crowd
on the pavement, stood the blue-eyed boy, clapping his
tiny hands, while the breeze blew his ﬂaxen hair all

himself on tiptoe and shouted the single word “ Ring! ”

KING'S MOUNTAIN.

A Balladof the Carol-inas.

WILLIAM GHiMORE SIMMS.

WILLIAM GILMORE SIMMS was born at Charleston, South

1 Carolina, in 1806, and died at Savannah in 1870.

He made verses when but seven years of age, and during the
War of 1812 Wrote many a rhyme celebrating the victories of
the American army and navy.

His early education Was received in the public schools of his
native city. At. the age of eighteen he began the study of law,
and was afterwards admitted to the bar. After practicing law
for a year, he purchased an interest in a newspaper, but this
venture proved unsuccessful. a

Mr. Simms then resolved to be an author, and from that time
was constantly at Work. He Wrote plays, poems, novels, and
historical romances. 1

» What Cooper was to the North, Simms was to the South.
His writings are full of vivid and picturesque scenes, telling of
the brave and chivalrous deeds of the people in his section of
the country. He was a true American and a man of pleasant
and genial manners. 1

HARK! ’t is the voice of the mountain,
And itspeaks to our heart in its pride,

As it tells of the bearing of heroes,
Who compassed its summits and died I

How they gathered to strife as the eagles,
Whenthe foemen had clambered the height!

How, with scent keen andeager as beagles,
They hunted them down for the ﬁght!

Hark! through the gorge of the valley,
’T is the bugle that tells of the foe;
Our own quickly sounds for the rally,
Andwe snatch ‘down the riﬂe and go.
As the hunters who hear of the panther,
Each arms him and leaps to his steed,
Rides forth through the desolate antre,
With the knife and the riﬂe at need.

From a thousand deep gorges they gather—
From the cot lowly perched by the rill,
The cabin half hid in the heather,
’Neath the crag where the eagle keeps still;
Each lonely at ﬁrst inhis roaming,
Till the vale to the sight opens fair,
And he sees the low cot through the gloaming,
When his bugle gives tongue to the air.

‘ Thus a thousand brave hunters assemble

For the hunt of the insolent foe ;
And soon shall his myrmidons tremble
’Neath the shock of the thunderbolt’s blow.
Down the lone heights now windthey together,
As the mountain brooks ﬂow to the vale,
And now, as they group on the heather,
The keen scout delivers his tale : —

“ The.British—the Toriesare on us;
And now is the moment to prove

->824-98<<-

To the women whose virtues have won us,
That our virtues are Worthy their love !
They have swept the vast valleys below us,

With ﬁre, to the hills from the sea;
And here would they seek to o’erthrow us,
In a realm which our eagle makes free! ”

No war council suffered to triﬂe
With the hours devote to the deed ;
Swift followed the grasp of the riﬂe,
  Swift followed the bound to the steed ;
And soon, to the eyes of our yeomen,
p All panting with rage at the sight,
Gleamed the long wavytents of the foeman,
As he lay in his camp on the height. W

Grim dashed they away as they bounded, —
The hunters to hem in the prey,—

And with Deekard’s long riﬂes surrounded,
Then the British rose fast to the fray;

And never, with arms of more vigor,
Didtheir bayonets press through the strife,

‘ Where, with every swift pull of the trigger,

The sharpshooters dashed out a life!

’T was the meeting of eagles and lions,
’T was the rushing of tempests and waves,
Insolent triumph ’gainst patriot deﬁance,
Born freemen ’gainst syoophant slaves :

SPRING IN KENTUCKY.
JAMES LANE ALLEN.

JAMES LANE ALLEN was born on a farm near Lexington, Ky.,
in 1850. The early years of his life were spent in careful
study. He became interested in v
literature, and wrote sketches and
poems for several magazines and
papers.

In 1885 he went to New York
City to continue this work. He
wrote a number of interesting ar~
ticles on the “Blue Grass Region”
in Kentucky. These were pub-
lished in “ Harper’s Magazine.”
His ﬁrst stories appeared shortly
after in “ The Century.”

Mr. Allen knows and loves Ken-
tucky, and it is there that he
locates his scenes. . He has written a number of delightful novels
which have been widely read. He resides in New York City and
is popular as a writer.

IT  the middle of February. So bleak a season 20C

touches my concern for birds, which never seem quite
at home in this world; and the winter has been most
lean and hungry for them. Many snows have fallen——
snows that are as raw cotton spread over their break-
fast table, and cutting off connection between them and 25
its bounties. 4

Next summer I must let theweeds grow up in my
garden, so that they may have a better chance for
seeds above the stingy level of the universal white.

Feels the moral that lies in Scotch thistle,

With its “ touch me Who dare! ” and he dies.

An hour, and the battle is over;
The eagles are rending the prey ;
The serpents seek ﬂight into cover,
But the terror still stands in the Way :
More dreadful the doom that on treason
Avenges the Wrongs of the state;
And the oak tree for many a season
Bears its fruit for the Vultures of Fate.

TRAILING ARBUTUS.
HENRY WARD BEECHER.

HENRY WARD BEECHER was born in Litchﬁeld, Conn., on the
24thof June, 1813. He Was graduated from Amherst College and
then studied theology with his father, the Rev. Lyman Beecher.

He became pastor of the Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, when
he was thirty-four years of age and held this position until his
death, in 1887.

Mr. Beecher was an author and orator as Well as a preacher.

ITHHE ground Was white in spots with half-

limelted snow. A few whirls of snow had come down

in the night, and the air was too cold to change to
rain. Some green leaves, in sheltered nooks,’ had
accepted the advances of the sun and Were preparing
for the summer.
after was trailing arbutus, one of the most exquisite
of all Nature’s fondlings. B ‘

I did not seek in vain. The hills Were covered with
it. Its gay whorls of buds peeped forth from ruffles
of snow in the most charming beauty. Many blossoms,
too, quite expanded, did I ﬁnd; some pure ‘White, and
a few more deliciously suffused with pink. For nearly
an hour I wandered up and down, in pleasant fancies,
searching, plucking, and arranging these most beauti-
ful of all early blossoms.

Who would suspect by the leaf What rare delicacy
vvas to be in the blossom? Like some people of plain

and hard exterior, but of sweet disposition, it was all
the more pleasant from the surprise of contrast. All
winter long this little thing must have slumbered With
dreams, at least, of spring. It has waited for no pioneer
or guide, but started of its own self and led the way
for all the ﬂowers on this hillside.  

Its little viny stem creeps close to the ground, hum-
ble, faithful, and showing how the purest white may
lay its cheek in the very dirt without soil or taint.

The odor of the arbutus is exquisite, and as delicate
as the plant is modest. Some ﬂowers seem determined
to make an impression on you. They stare at you.
They dazzle your eyes. If you smell them, they over-
ﬁll your sense with their fragrance. They leave
nothing for your gentleness and generosity, but do
everything themselves. ‘

But this sweet nestler of the spring hills is so se- i

cluded, half covered with russet leaves, that you would

not suspect its graces, did you not stoop to uncover

the vine, to lift it up, and then you espy its secluded
beauty.

If you smell it, at ﬂrst it seems hardly to have an
odor. Butthere steals out of it at length the ﬁnest,
rarest scent, that rather cites desire than satisﬁes your
sense. It is coy, without designing to be so, and its
reserve plays upon the imagination far more than could
a more positive way. 4

Without doubt there are intrinsic beauties in plants

and ﬂowers, and yet very much of pleasure dependsupon,

grow, and to our own moods.
can produce the thrill that the earliest blossoms bring,
which tell us that winter is gone, that growing days
have come! .

Indeed, it often happens that the air is cold and the
face of earth is brown, so that we have no suspicion that
it is time for anything to sprout, until we chance upon
a ﬂower. That reveals what our senses had failed to
perceive—a warmth in the air, a warmth in the soil,
an advance in the seasons 1 i

Strange that a silent white ﬂower, growing on a

“ hillside, measures the astronomic changes, and, more

than all our senses, discerns that the sun is traveling
back from his far southward ﬂight! ,

Sometimes we admire ﬂowers for their boldness, in
places where that quality seems ﬁt. When meadows
and ﬁelds are gorgeous, we look for some ﬂower that
shall give the climax. An intensity often serves to
reveal the nature of things in all their several grada-
tions. i

A violet color in these early spring days would not
please half so well as these pure whites or tender
pinks. We like snowdrops and crocuses to come up
pale colored, as if born of the snow and carrying
their mother’s complexion. But later, when the eye
is used to blossoms, we wish deeper effects and pro-
fusions of color, which, had they existed earlier, would
have offended us.

Flowers seem to have a peculiar power over some

natures. Of course they gratify the original faculties

"of form, color, odor 5 but that is the least part of their

effect. They have a mysterious and subtle inﬂuence
upon the feelings, not unlike some strains of music.
They relax the tenseness of the mind. a They dissolve

, its rigor.

In their presence one ﬁnds an almost magnetic trem-
ulousness, as if they Were messengers from the spirit
World, and conveyed an atmosphere with them in Which
the feelings ﬁnd soothing, pleasure, and peacefulness.

Besides this, they are provocative of imagination.
They set the mind full of fancies. Theyseem to be
pretty and innocent jugglers that play their charms
and incantations upon the senses and the fancy, and
lead off the thoughts in gay analogies or curious med-
leys of fantastic dreaming. i

THE CHRISTIAN KNIGHT AND, THE SARACEN CAVALIER.

SIR WALTER SCOTT.

For a sketch of the life of Sir Walter Scott, see “ Cyr’s Fourth Reader.”

THE burning sun of Syria had not yet attained its
highest point in the horizon when a knight of the Red
Cross, who had left his distant northern home and
joined the host of the crusaders in Palestine, was pa-

cing slowly along the sandy deserts which lie in the
« vicinity of the Dead Sea, where the waves of the Jor-
dan pour themselves into an inland sea from whichv
A. there is no discharge of waters.

The dress of the rider and the accouterments of his
horse were peculiarly unﬁt for the traveler in such a
country. A coat of linked mail, with long sleeves,
plated gauntlets, and a steel breastplate, had not been

esteemed a suﬁicient weight of armor ;‘ there was also

his triangular shield suspended round his neck, and his
barred helmet of steel, over which he had a hoodand
collar of mail, which was drawn around the warrior’s

10

shoulders and throat and ﬁlled up the vacancy between .

the hauberk and the headpiece. His lower limbs were
sheathed, like his body, in flexible mail, securing the
legs and thighs, while thefeet rested in plated shoes,
which corresponded with the gauntlets.

A long, broad, straight-shaped, double-edged falchion,
with a handle formed like a cross, corresponded with a
stout poniard on the other side. The knight also bore,

 +>52568<~

secured to his saddle, with one end resting on his stir-
rup, the long steel-headed lance, his own proper weapon,
which, as he rode, projected backwards and displayed

T its little pemzoncelle, to dally witli the faint breeze or

drop in the dead calm. To this cumbrous equipment
must be added a surcoat of embroidered cloth, much

. frayed and worn, which was thus far useful that it

10

excluded the burning rays of the sun from the armor,
Which they would otherwise have rendered intolerable
to the wearer.  

The surcoat bore in several places the arms of the
owner, although much defaced. These seemed to be
a couchant leopard with the motto: “I slcep—walce me
not.” An outline of the same device might be traced on
his shield, though many a blow had almost defaced the
painting. The ﬂat top of his cumbrous cylindrical

  helmet was unadorned with any crest.

The accouterments of the horse were scarcely less
massive and unwieldy than those of the rider. The
animal had a heavy saddle plated with steel, uniting
in front with a species of breastplate, and behindvwith
defensive armor made to cover the loins. Then there
was a steel axe or hammer, called a mace-of-arms,
which hung to the saddlebow; the reins were secured
by chain work, and the front stall of the bridle was a
steel plate with apertures for the eyes and nostrils,
having in the midst a short, sharp pike projecting from

. the forehead of thehorse like the horn of the fabulous

unicorn.

the inﬁdel, who now approached on his gallant barb as

->8257’3<"

As the Knight of the Couchant Leopard continued
to fix his eyes attentively on the yet distant clusterof
palm trees, it seemed to him as if some object were
moving among them. The distant form separated
itself from the trees, which partly hid its motions, and
advanced toward the knight with a speed which soon
showed a mounted horseman, whom his turban, long
spear, and green caftan ﬂoating in the wind, on his
nearer approach, proved to be a Saracen cavalier. “ In
the desert,” saith an Eastern proverb, “no man meets a
The crusader was totally indifferent whether

if borne on the wings of an eagle, came as a friend or
foe ; perhaps as a vowed champion of the cross, he might
rather have preferred the latter. He disengaged his lance
from his saddle, seized it with the right hand, placed it
in ‘rest with its point half elevated, gathered up the reins
in the left, waked his horse’s mettle with the spur, and
prepared to encounter the stranger with the calm self-
conﬁdence belonging to the victor of many contests.

1o

20

The Saracen came on at the speedy gallop of an Arab  

horseman, managing his steed more by his limbs and
the’ inﬂection of his body than by any use of the reins,
which hung loose in his left hand; so that he was
enabled to wield the light, round buckler of the skin
of the rhinoceros, ornamented with silver loops which
he wore on his arm, swinging it as if he meant to
oppose its slender circle to the formidable thrust of
the Western lance. 

10

15

—~>82588<“

His own long spear was not couched or leveled like

that of his antagonist, but grasped by the middle with .
his ‘right hand and brandished at arm’s length above

his head. As the cavalier approached his enemy at
full career, he seemed to expect that the Knight of the
Leopard would put his horse to the gallop to encounter
him. .
But the Christian knight, well acquainted with the
customs of Eastern warriors, did not mean to exhaust
his good horse by any unnecessary exertion; and, on
the contrary, made a dead halt, conﬁdent that if the
enemy advanced to the actual shook, his own weight
andthat of his powerful charger would give him sufe
ﬁcient advantage without the additional momentum of
rapid motion. ’ V
Equally sensible and apprehensive of such a probable

‘ result, the Saracen cavalier, when he had approached

20

within twice the length of his lance, wheeled his steed
to the left with inimitable dexterity and rode twice
around his antagonist, who, turning without quitting
his ground, and presenting his front constantly to his

enemy, frustrated his attempts to attack him on an
unguarded point; so that the Saracen, Wheeling his ”

. horse, was fain to retreat to the distance of a hundred

25

yards.

Alsecond time, like a hawk attacking a heron, the
heathen renewed the charge, and a second time was fain
to retreat without coming toa close struggle. A third
time he approached in the same manner, when the

+>82593<"

Christian linight, desirous to terminate this illusory
warfare, in which he might at length have been worn
out by the activity of his foeman, suddenly seized the
mace which hung at his saddlebow, and, with a strong
hand and unerring aim, hurled it against the head of
the Emir; for such, and not less, his enemy appeared.
The Saracen was just aware of the formidable mis-
sile. in time to interpose his light buckler betwixt the

mace and his head ; but the violence of the blow forced  

s the buckler down on his turban, and though that defense

also contributed to deaden its violence, the Saracen was

— beaten from his horse.

Ere the Christian could avail himself of this mishap
his nimble foeman sprang from the ground, and, calling
on his steed,which instantly returned to his side, he
leaped into his seat without touching the stirrup and
regained all the advantage of which the Knight of the
Leopard had hoped to deprive him.

But the latter had in the meanwhile recovered his
mace, and the Eastern cavalier, who remembered the
strength and dexterity with which his antagonist had

aimed it, seemed to keep cautiously out of reach of that

Weapon of which he had so lately felt the force ; while
he showed his purpose of waging a distant warfare with
missile weapons of his own. i    
Planting his long spear in the sand at a distance
from the scene of combat, he strung with great address
a short bow which he carried at his back, and, putting
his horse to the gallop, once more described two or

Of late I have opened a pawnbroker’s shop for my
hard-pressed brethren in feathers, lending at a fearful
rate of interest, for every borrower will have to pay
me back in due time by monthly instalments of sing-

And to-day, also, I ordered from a nurseryman more

at bay; prying eyes cannot watch them, nor enemies

But wintering here has terrible risks which few can

run. Scarcely in autumn have the leaves begun to

drop from their high perches silently downward‘ when a

the birds begin to drop away from the bare boughs

  course of which he discharged six arrows at the Chris-

10

tian with such unerring skill that the goodness of his
harness alone saved him from being wounded in as
many places. The seventh shaft apparently found a
less perfect part of the armor, and the   Christian
dropped heavily from his horse.  
‘But what was the surprise of the Saracen, when,
dismounting to examine the condition of his prostrate
enemy, he found himself suddenly within the grasp of
the European, who had had recourse to this artiﬁce to
bring his enemy within his reach. Even in this deadly
grapplethe Saracen was saved by his agility and pres-
ence of mind. He unloosed the sword-belt in which the
Knightof the Leopard had ﬁxed his hold, and thus elud-

_ ing his fatal grasp, mounted his horse, which seemed

But in the last encounter the Saracen had lost his t

attached to the girdle, which he was obliged. to
He had also lost his turban in the struggle.
These disadvantages seemed to incline the Moslem
to a truce; he approached the Christian with his
right hand extended, but no longer in a_ menacing
attitude.

A MYSTERIOUS VISITOR.
THOMAS CARLYLE.

THOMAS CARLYLE was born in a little village in Scotland, in
the year 17 95.

- His father, James Carlyle, was a poor mason, so poor that at

times there was scarcely enough food in the house for his

5 family; but the father resolved that the boy should have an

25

‘30

education, and saved, little by little, the money to pay for it.
,When Thomas was ten years old, he and his father Walked to
the town of Annan, Where Thomas Was to enter the academy.
  T - The father little dreamed, as they
trudged along together, that one
day his son would be famous as
one of the World’s greatest Writers,
so great that even the Queen of
England would Wish to talk with
him. _

He studied at the academy of
Annan for three years. His father,
dressed in his coarse Workman’s
clothes, once visited him there.
Thomas was afraid that the other
boys would laugh at him, but the
sturdy Scotchman Was so digniﬁed that he Won their respect.

VVhen Thomas reached the age of thirteen his parents decided
to send him to the great University at Edinburgh. They Walked
through the village streets with him and Watched him start on the
highway. ‘It was a journey of a hundred miles, and he traveled
all the Way on foot.   H

These experiences made the boy brave and resolute. He Was.

not afraid. of the World. ,
A few years after leaving the University he began to earn his
living by writing. . For many years his income was small, as he

+8263 8%

would only ‘write what he thought would make the world better.
He used to say that he would write his books as his father built
his houses, so that they would last. He scolded the world for
its faults, but he was very kind-hearted.

His “ History of the French Revolution” is a won.derful work. .

When the ﬁrst volume of this history was-written, Carlyle
loaned it to a friend, and the manuscript was accidentally
destroyed. Carlyle did not utter a word of reproach, although
the loss meant months of study and thought, but set manfully
to work and wrote it once more.

He was fond of German literature, and translated the “ Wil-
helm Meister” by Goethe. He wrote many other books, and

4 became so famous that when Gladstone retired from oﬂice as

Lord Rector of Edinburgh, Carlyle was made his successor. It

_Was a great triumph for the mason’s son; but in the midst of

his new honors his wife died, and there was no one to share his
happiness. ,

Not long after this, Queen Victoria sent for Carlyle and
granted him a personal interview. On his eightieth birthday
he was honored by gifts from Scotland, England, and Germany.
Hedied in 1881.

IN the village of Entepfuhl dwelt Andreas Futteral
and his wife—childless, in still seclusion, and cheerful,
though now verging toward old age.

Andreashad been grenadier sergeant and even regi-
mental schoolmaster under Frederick the Great; but

now, quitting the halbert and ferrule for the spade

and pruning hook, cultivated a little orchard, on the
produce of which he lived not without dignity.
Fruits, the peach, the apple, the grape, with other

. varieties came in their season, all of which Andreas

knew how to sell. On evenings he smoked or read

(as beseemed a regimental schoolmaster), and talked
to the neighbors about the victory of Rossbach ; and

how “ Fritz the Only” had once with his own royal

lips spoken to him, and had been pleased to say,
when Andreas as camp sentinel demanded the password,
“ Peace, hound I ” before any of his staff adjutants could

" answer. “ There is what I call a king! ” would Andreas

exclaim; “but the smoke of Kunersdorf was still
smarting his eyes.”
  Gretchen, the housewife, had been won by the deeds

rather than the looks of her husband, nevertheless she . 

at heart loved him both for his valor and wisdom.
Was not Andreas in very deed a man of order, courage,
downrightness, that understood Biisching’s Geography,
had been in the victory of Rossbach, and left for dead
on the battleﬁeld ? A o

The good Gretchen, for all her fretting, watched
over him and hovered round him as only a true house-

‘ cially on summer nights, a king might have wished

him; so that not only his old regimental sword and

  grenadier cap, but the whole habitation, where on pegs

of honor they hung, looked ever trim and gay; a
roomy cottage, embowered in fruit trees and forest
trees, evergreens and honeysuckles, rising many-colored
from amid shaven grass plots, ﬂowers struggling in

through the very windows ; under its long projecting  

eaves nothing but garden tools and seats where, espe-

Into this home, one meek, yellow evening, it was
that a stranger of reverend aspect entered, and, with
grave salutation, stood before the two rather aston-
ished housemates. He was closely muffled in a wide

mantle, which without farther parley unfolding, he
deposited therefrom what seemed some basket, over-

hung with green Persian silk, saying only: “Good
Christian people, here lies for you an invaluable loan; -

take all heed thereof, in all carefulness employ it;
with high recompense, or else with heavy penalty will
it one day be required back.” Uttering which singu-
lar words in a clear, bell-like, forever memorable tone,
the stranger gracefully withdrew ; and before Andreas
and his wife, gazing in expectant wonder, had time to
fashion either question or answer, was gone.

Neither out of doors could aught of him be seen or
heard; he had vanished in the thickets, in the dusk;
the orchard gate stood quietly closed; the stranger was
gone once and always. So sudden had the whole trans-
action been in the autumn stillness and twilight, so
gentle and noiseless, that the Futterals could have fan-
cied it all a trick of imagination, or asvisit from some
spirit; only that green silk basket, such as neither

imagination nor spirits are wont to carry, still stood

visible and tangible on their little parlor table.
Toward this the astonished couple, now with lit can-
dle, hastily turned their attention. Lifting the green

if veil to see what irivaluable it hid, they descried there,

amid down and rich white wrappings, no Pitt diamond.

or Hapsburg regalia, but in the softest sleep a little
red-colored infant! Beside it lay a roll of gold, the exact

‘amount of which was never publicly known; also a bap-

tismal certiﬁcate, wherein, unfortunately, nothing but
the name was decipherable.

To wonder and conjecture were unavailing then and
thenceforth. Nowhere in Entepfuhl did tidings tran-
spire of any such ﬁgure as the stranger. Meanwhile, for

Andreas and his wife, the grand practical problem was  

what to do with this little sleeping infant! Amid
amazements and curiosities which had to die away
without satisfying, they ‘resolved, as in such circum-

I stances charitable, prudent people needs must, on nurs-

20

ing it, if possible, into manhood.

Young Diogenes, or rather young Grneschen, for by
such diminutive had they in their fondness named him,
traveled forward by quick but easy stages. I have
heard him noted as a still infant, that kept his mind
much to himself; above all, that he seldom cried. He
already felt that time was precious ; that he had other
work cut out for him than whimpering. .

Most graceful is the following little picture: “ On
ﬁne-evenings I was wont to carry forth my supper,
bread crumbs boiled in milk, and eat it out of doors.
On the coping of the orchard "Wall, which I could reach
by climbing, or still more easily if Father Andreas
would set up the pruning ladder, my porringer was
placed; there many a sunset have I, looking at the
western mountains, consumed my evening meal.

“Those hues of gold and azure, that hush of the
world’s expectation as day died, were still a Hebrew
speech for. me; nevertheless I was looking at the fair,
illuminated letters, and had an eye for their gilding.”'

Witli the little one’s friendship for cattle and poul-
try we shall not much intermeddle, It may be that
hereby he acquired a certain deeper sympathy with
animated nature. He says again : “ Impressive enough
was it to hear in early morning the swineherd’s horn,
and know that so many hungry quadrupeds were, on all
sides, starting in hot haste to join him for breakfast
on the heath. Or to see them at eventide, all march-

" ing in again with short squeak, almost in military

order; and each trotting off in succession to the right
or left, through its ownlane, to its own dwelling.”

Thus encircled by mystery,'waited on by the four
seasons, with their changing contributions, for even
grim winter brought its skating matches, its snow-
storms and Christmas carols, did the child sit and
learn. These things were the alphabet whereby in
after time he was to syllable and partly read the
grand volume of the world; what matters it whether
suchalphabet be in large gilt letters or in small ungilt
ones, so you have an eye to read it?

For Grneschen, eager to learn, the very act of look-

i ing thereon’ was a blessedness that gilded all; his exist-

ence was a bright, soft element of joy, out of which
wonder after wonder bodied itself forth to teach by

charmin .

I lay awake, there fell from the upper air the notes of
the wild-gander as he wedged his way onward by faith,
not by sight, toward his distant bourn. I rose and,
throwing open the shutters, strained eyes toward the
unseen explorer, startled, as a half-asleep soldier might
be startled by the faint bugle-call of his commander
blown to him from the clouds. rWhat far-off lands,
streaked with mortal dawn, does he believe in?

ADDRESS TO THE SURVIVORS OF THE BATTLE OF
BUNKER HILL.

DANIEL WEBSTER.

DANIEL WEBSTER, one of the greatest of American statesmen,
was born at Salisbury, N. H., in 1782.

His father, Ebenezer Webster, was a farmer and Justice of the ~
County Court. He had been an officer in the’ Revolutionary war.

Daniel received his early instruction from his mother, a woman 5 H

of rare intellectual powers, and .  
from the country school which 
he attended during the winters.

Although he became a distin-

in public speaking at school.
He afterwards said: “ There
was one thing I could not do;
I could not make a declamation.
I could not speak before the
school.”

Daniel showed so great abil-
ity as a student that the family 
decided he must attend college, A

although this step called for additional hardship and sacriﬁce 20,

on the part of those at home. He studied under the direction
of a clergyman in a neighboring town, spent one year at Phil-
llpSAEX8l38I' Academy, and entered Dartmouth College when he
was ﬁfteen years old. During his vacations he taught school
to pay his expenses. He also assisted his brother Ezekiel in 25
obtaining his education. ‘

He ﬁnished his course at college with credit, and then_studied
law in Boston. He began his practice in Boscawen, a country
town near his home; but after the death of his father he re-
moved to Portsmouth, and was soon regarded as the leading 30
man in his profession. ‘a

10

->82783<‘-

After a time he removed to Boston, where he became known

as one of the ablest lawyers of his time.

Webster was elected to Congress from Boston, and took his
seat in December, 1823, and continued to serve in that position
till he was elected to the Senate, in which body he took his seat
on the 4th of March, 1827.

The awkward village lad who could not declaiin in the district
school now ranked among the most eloquent orators of the country.

On the anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers,
Webster delivered a stirring oration, which made him famous
throughout the country; and at the laying of the corner stone
of the Bunker Hill Monument he delivered an address which has
not been equaled in this century. From that time Daniel Webster
was sought after for every public occasion. He twice held the
ofﬁce of Secretary of State. He resigned the latter office on
account of failing health during the summer of 1852, and retired
to his country seat at Marshﬁeld, Mass., where he died in the
following October. ’ r

YOU have come down to us from a former generation.
Heaven has bounteously lengthened outyour lives that
you might behold this joyous day. You are now where
you stood ﬁfty years ago this very hour, with your
brothers and your neighbors, shoulder to shoulder in
the strife of your country. Behold how altered! The
same heavens are indeed over your heads; the same
ocean rolls at your feet; but all else, how, changed!
You hear now no roar of hostile cannon; you see no
mixed volumes of smoke and ﬂame rising from burning
Charlestown. The ground strewed with the dead and
the dying; the impetuous charge; the steady and suc-

cessful repulse; the loud call to repeated assault; the
summoning of all that is manly to repeated resistance ;

them no more. All is peace. The heights of yonder
metropolis, its towers and roofs, which you then saw
ﬁlled with wives and children and countrymen in dis-
tress and terror, and looking with unutterable emotions
for the issue of the combat, have presented you to-day

Another day she attacks the piles of dead leaves,
where they have lain since last October, and scatters
them in a trice, so that every cranny may be sunned
and aired. Or, grasping her long brooms by the ban-

dles, she will go into the woods and beat the icicles off

the big trees as a housewife would brush down cobwebs.‘
This done, she begins to hang up soft, new curtains
at the forest windows, and to spread over her ﬂoor a

new carpet of an emerald loveliness such as no rmowrytal _

looms could ever have woven.

And then, at last, she sends out invitations through
the south for’ the birds to come and spend the summer
in Kentucky. The invitations are sent ‘out in March,
and accepted in April and May, and by June her house
is full of visitors.   s

Union, to see What might lie hidden in the dark recess
behind. Nor could I regard him as a safe counsellor
in the affairs of this government whose thoughts should
be mainly bent on considering, not how the Union may
be best preserved, but how tolerable might be the con-
dition of the people When it shall be broken up and
destroyed. ,While the Union lasts, We have high,
exciting, gratifying’ prospects spread out before us,

RECESSIONAL.
A Victorian Ode.
RUDYARD KIPLING.

RUDYARD KIPLING was born in Bombay, India, in 1865.

His father and mother used to meet beside Lake Rudyard,
and gave its name to their son. John Lockwood Kipling, the
father, .was at the head of the
Lahore School of Art, and has
illustrated a recent edition of his
son’s Works.

011 reaching the school age,
young Kipling was sent to Eng-
land to be educated, as Was -the
custom among the English resi-
dents of India. He Was educated
in the United Services College,
returning home at the age of
eighteen.

It was his ambition to become
a Writer and he secured employ-
ment on the “ Civil and Military Gazette.” His Work here fa1nil-
iarized him with the life in the garrisons, which he afterwards
turned to good account in his ballads and short stories.

He was twenty-one years old when he became assistant editor
of the “ Lahore Journal.” It was a strange newspaper office,
judging by accounts which he has given us of it. There were
native type—setters and a queer Mohammedan foreman. In a
story which he Wrote, called “ The Man Who Would be King,”
Kipling tells how they Worked in the stiﬂing Indian heat.

From time to time Kipling published verses and stories in the
local paper, and when these had been gathered together and sent
out into the Worldin the form of a book called “ Plain Tales

from the Hills,” the name of the young author and poet became
famous.

He then went to England and made his home in London.
He wrote many stories and poems of the old life in India,
one of the best collections of which is the “ Barrack-Room
Ballads.” J

In London he met Walcott Balestier, of Brattleboro, Vt., and

they wrote stories together until Balestier’s death. Not long

after, Kipling married Caroline Balestier. They came to this
country and lived for a time in Vermont, where the poet sur-
rounded himselfwith everything that would remind him of the
life in India.  

Among other works of Kipling are “Soldiers Three,” “ The
Phantom ’Rickshaw, and Other Stories,” the two Jungle Books,
and “ The Day’s Work.” I

At the time of Queen Victoria’s jubilee, Kipling wrote what
was perhaps his greatest poem, the “Recessional,” which was
published in “The London Times.” '

GOD -of our fathers, known of old—
Lord of our far-ﬂung battle line-
Beneath whose awful hand we hold
Dominion over palm and pine —
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget— lest we forget!

The tumult and the shouting dies———
The Captains and the Kings depart--
Still stands Thine ancient sacriﬁce,
An humble and a contrite heart.

Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!

—~>82853<"

Far-called our navies melt aWay—

On dune and headland sinks the ﬁre—
Lo, all our pomp of yesterday

Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!

Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,
Lest We forget—-lest We forget!

If, drunk With sight of power, We loose
Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe-=
Such boasting as the Gentiles use,

Or lesser breeds Without the LaW—

Lord God of Hosts, be with ‘us yet,

Lest We forget—lest We forget!

For heathen heart that puts her trust

In reeking tube and iron shard———

All Valiant dust that builds on dust,

And guarding calls not Thee to guard.

For frantic boast and foolish word, L

Thy Mercy on Thy People, Lord!
Amen.

WILLIAM HICKLING PRESCOTT.

WILLIAM HICKLING PRESCOTT was born in the quaint
old town of Salem, Mass., on the 4th of May, 1796.
His father Was a successful lawyer, and his mother was
a lady of great ability
Who spent much time in
educating and training
her son. VVilliam was a
bright, merry boy, who
learned with ease, and
Was a . great favorite
among the boys. The
ﬁrst school he attended
Was taught bya gentle, old-
fashioned lady, who was
called the school mother.
When he was seven years

old he Was sent to a more advanced school, taught by

“ Master Knapp,” and remained there for ﬁve years.

Though strong and large of his age, he cared more

20 for books than he did for boyish sports. He never
remembered a time when he did not love to read.

When he Was twelve years old his father removed to

Boston, and William was sent to the best classical school

then known in New England. He had George Ticknor
25 the historian for a classmate and friend. The two boys

progressed so rapidly in Latin and Greek that they out-
distanced the rest of the class and recited by them selves.

->82873<“

Books and reading matter were then much more rare
than now; but not far from the Prescott home there
had been started a library, called the Boston Athenaeum.
The founder, Mr. William Shaw, who also acted as
librarian, was fond of bright boys and allowed a few
of them to read there. William, w11o was one of his

favorites, spent many an hour in these rooms, reading

whatever pleased his fancy. He was especially fond
of romances and tales of wild adventure.
His most intimate friend was a son of Dr. Gardiner,

his teacher, and the boys were constantly together.

They used to invent stories to tell each other on their
way to and from school. Prescott’s tales Were the
wilder, for he had a vivid imagination and had read
many books of adventure. ' G
William’s grandfather, Colonel Prescott, had com-
manded the American forces at Bunker Hill, and Wil-
liam often listened to the story of this battle, and
gazed with awe upon the sword which the colonel wore
during the contest. He and young Gardiner amused

themselves with ﬁghting mock battles, dressing in some G

pieces of old armor which they found among the curi-
osities of the Athenaeum, and imagining that they were
Revolutionary heroes, Greeks or Romans, or knights of
the olden time. _ ,

Prescott ‘entered Harvard College at the age of ﬁf-

teen, passing his examinations with credit. He wished ‘

to hold a high rank in his class, and as it was an eﬁort

certain time to each study. He was of a happy, gay
disposition and enjoyed the college life ; but his course
Was interrupted by a painful accident. He was passing
out of the dining hall one day When the sound of some

frolic attracted his attention and he turned his head to

see What it was. At that moment one of the students
threw a piece of bread, Which struck him on the open

eye  

The shock of the blow was so great that he fell and
Was taken to his home and placed in the charge of a
After several Weeks he returned to college,
but the sight of the injured eye Was entirely destroyed.
He Was graduated with honors in spite of this affliction,
and Wrote a Latin poem for Commencement.

On leaving college Prescott entered his father’s law
office, but continued reading Latin and Greek. After
several months his sound eye became affected and there
Was fear of his becoming totally blind. He spent four
months in a darkened room and bore his suffering
bravely, always greeting thefamily with some Word of

cheer, as though they were the sufferers and it was his r

place to comfort them. As soon as he Was able to
travel he was sent to visit his grandfather Hickling,
who Was United States Consul at the Azores.

The passage Was long and trying, and he was glad
to reach land and receive the hearty Welcome of his
relatives. They ‘lived in a delightful country house,

in the midst of a beautiful garden, and Prescott» Was

charmed with the tropical plants and orange groves.

~>'82893<*

He had been there but a fortnight when his eye again

became affected, and he was obliged to spend three
months in a darkened room. But he was so bright
and patient that he won the hearts of all, and it was
with sorrow that they ﬁnally saw him sail away.

After leaving the Azores, he spent several months in
Europe, and then returned to America, spending the
next winter at home. He was obliged to_ avoid the
light; but his old school friend, Gardiner, read some
of his favorite books to him each day, and his sister
spent the greater part of her time With him,reading
to him for hours.

Prescott was now twenty-two years old, and his out-
look for the future was discouraging. He did not
know what profession to follow, for there was no hope
of his fully regaining his sight.
improvement in spite of his quiet life, and he began to
go about and enjoy society.

He was married, when he was twenty-four years of
age, to Miss Susan Amory, who was his devoted wife
and companion. Mrs. Prescott’s grandfather had also
been a commander at the Battle of Bunker Hill, and
captain of a British sloop-of-war.

The swords worn by the soldier and the sailor on that
day had been handed down in both families, and hung
for many years in Prescott’s library, peacefully crossed
above his books.

« Prescott had now chosen a life of literary work, and
persuaded himself that so long as his hearing was

WILLIAM WORDSWORTH. ‘

VVILLIAM WORDSWORTH, one of the Lake poets, was
born in England, on the 7th of April, 1770. His father
was a lawyer who belonged to a ﬁne old English family.
His mother was descended from a family of rank.

William had three A
brothers, and one sister,
Dorothy, who was his
constant companion.

His mother died
when he was but eight
years old, and he re-
membered but little
about her; but he
once overheard her
tell one of her friends
that VVilliam was the
only one of her chil-
dren for whom she »
was anxious ——he would be remarkable for good or evil.

Wordsworth spent a very free boyhood ; he was strong 20
and vigorous, and loved to be in the open air. This
out-of-door life did much to make him a poet. He
afterwards wrote: — i

“ I had a world about me ——’t was my own; V
I made it, for it only lived to me, 25
And to the God who sees into the heart.”

spared he wouldbe able to succeed. He felt that he

must make especial preparation in order to gain the S

place he desired, and began to study as if he were a
schoolboy, reading the best English, Latin, French, and
Italian authors. g_

He intended to study German, but he became inter-

ested in some lectures on Spanish literature, written by

his friend Mr. Ticknor, and decided to Write a history
of the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella. t
This Was slow Work, for although he learnedthe
language, he Was unable to use his eyes and depended
on the reading of a man who could only pronounce the
Spanish Words. He ﬁnally secured a secretary and

reader who understood Spanish and could copy his r

notes for him. His own Writing Was done with the
aid of an instrument used_ by the blind, which guided
his hand upon the paper. ,
After ten years of labor his book was published.
Its success was remarkable, and it was reprinted in
England, Germany, and Spain.
' Mr. Prescott was then nearly forty-two years old, tall,
handsome, and attractive in his manner. He led a regu-
lar life, planning his days carefully, rising at a ﬁxed

hour each morning, and taking exercise in the open air. ~

He was a good horseman and composed some of his
most stirring battle scenes as he galloped along the
country roads. S A

He divided his time among three residences————one
in the city of Boston, another at Lynn, with aview of

Colonel Prescott.

The success of “Ferdinand and Isabella” led the
author to continue his Writing, and after resting for
some months, he began to prepare the “ History of the
Conquest of Mexico,” which was published six years
after his ﬁrst history. This Work was greeted with

‘- applause throughout the country. Four years later he

Wrote the “ History of the Conquest of Peru.” He next
undertook the “History of Philip the Second,” but it

1850, and received a most cordial Welcome and many
attentions. On his return his health failed and he

spent less time in writing. His family were always

very dear to him, and he delighted in gathering his

stead at Pepperell. Mr. Prescott died in 1859.

it was absolutely necessary to dislodge the enemy from

Indian pioneers were sent forward to clear away the

the three bodies, bursting impetuously on the disordered

and the slaughter was terrible. But the Indians grad-

on the horses which they had taken from the white men.
The young Inca in particular, accoutered in the European
fashion, rode a war horse which he managed with con-
siderable address, and, with a long lance in his hand,
led on his followers to the attack.

After a gallant struggle, in which the natives threw

themselves fearlessly on the horsemen, endeavoring to

tear them from their saddles, they were obliged to give
way before the repeated shock oftheir charges. ,Many
were trampled under foot, others cut down by the Span-

ish broadswords, while the arquebusiers, supporting the

cavalry, kept up a running fire that did terrible execu-
tion on the ﬂanks and rear of the fugitives. At length,
trusting that the chastisement he had inflicted on the
enemy would secure him from further annoyance for
the present, the Castilian general drew back his forces
to their quarters in the capital.

"His next step was the recovery of the citadel. It
was an enterprise of danger. The fortress, which over-
looked the northern section of the city, stood high on
a rocky eminence, where it was defended only by a
single wall. Towards the open country it was more
easy of approach; but there it was protected by two
semicircular walls, each about twelve hundred feet in
length and of great thickness. Within the interior wall
was the fortress, consisting of three strong towers, one of
great height, which, with a smaller one, was now held by

the enemy, under the command of an Inca noble, a war-

rior of well-tried valor, prepared to defend it to the last.

As the fortress was to be approached through the

corps of horsemen, and took a direction opposite to that

But, secretly
countermarching in the night, he fortunately found
the passes undefended and arrived before the outer
wall of the fortress without giving the alarm to the

The entrance was through a narrow opening in the
center of the rampart; but this was now closed up
with heavy stones that seemed to form one solid work
with the rest of the masonry. It was an affair of time
to dislodge these huge masses in such a manner as not
The Indian natives, who rarely
attacked in the night, were not sufﬁciently acquainted
with the art of war even to provide against surprise by
posting sentinels. When the task was accomplished,

‘Juan Pizarro and his gallant troop rode through the

gateway and advanced towards the second parapet.
‘But their movements had not been conducted so
secretly as to escape notice, and they now found the
interior court swarming with warriors, who, as the
Spaniards drew z,.n}éa1i~, let off clouds of missiles that
compelled them to come to a halt. Juan Pizarro,

‘ aware that no time was to be lost, ordered one-half

of his corps to dismount, and, putting himself at their

head, prepared to make a breach as before in the forti-
ﬁcations. Leading on his men, he encouraged them in
the workof demolition in the face of such a storm of
stones, javelins, and arrows as might have made the
stoutest heart shrink from encountering it. The good
mail of the Spaniards did not always protect them; but
others took the place of such as fell, until a breach was
made, and the cavalry, pouring in, rode down all who
opposed them. _ T
The parapet was now abandoned, and the Indians,
hurrying with disorderly ﬂight across the enclosure,
took refuge on a kind of platform or terrace,‘ com-
manded by the principal tower. Here, rallying,th'ey
shot off fresh volleys of missiles against the Spaniards,
while the garrison in the fortress hurled down’ frag-
ments of rock and timber on their heads. Juan Pizarro,
still among the foremost, sprang forward on the ter-
race, cheering on his men by his voice and example;
but at this moment he was struck by a large stone on
the head, not then protected by his buckler, and was
stretched on the ground. The dauntless chief still con-
tinued to animate his followers by his voice till the ter-
race was carried and its miserable defenders were put

A COUNTRY SUNDAY.
JOSEPH ADDISON.

JOSEPH ADDISON was born in England in 1672. His father
was a clergyman, well educated and of strong character. He was
devoted to his family, and their home life was delightful.

Joseph first attended the schools in the neighborhood, and

4   ~- was then sent to the Charter-
house, which was one of the
best—known schools in England.

He entered Oxford when he
was ﬁfteen years old, and was
looked upon as a promising
scholar. After two years at
this college a copy of some
Latin verses Written by him
fell into the hands of Dr. Lan-
caster, a man of influence, and
he was elected to a scholarship
in Magdalen College.

His life there was quiet, he
studied late at night, and went
20 on long, solitary walks. He continued to write Latinvversés, and

became so familiar with the Latin writers that he could recite

many of their poems. Every little touch of beauty was appre-
ciated by him and ﬁlled him with delight.
. From his twenty-ﬁrst to his thirty-second year Addison spent
25 his time in study, Writing, and thought.

He spent several years in traveling about France and Italy.
While in Paris he lived at the house of the ambassador, where
he met the most brilliant society; and in Italy he studied the
great works of art. These views of life, added to his natural grace

30 and love of reﬁnement, made him a master of literary style and
expression. On his return from his travels he held several offices
for the government, and later became a member of Parliament.

~>a2998<~

Richard Steele, an old schoolfellow and writer of some note,
started some periodicals—“ The Tatler,” followed by “The
Spectator,” and later by “ The Guardian.” Addison became
interested in these publications and Wrote a large number of
essays for them—among them the “_ Sir Roger de Coverley
Papers.” His characters were taken from life and he describes
the manners and customs of the time in language which is cited
by all critics as a model of pure English. He also Wrote several
dramas and poems.

When he was nineteen years old William spent
several Weeks with his sister, and as they wandered
about Dovedale together, planning and dreaming of

his own choosing. He has likewise given a handsome
pulpit cloth, and railed in the communion table at his
  , own expense. , a

He has often told me that at his
coming to his estate, he found his
parishioners very irregular; and that
in order to make them kneel and join
in the responses, he gave every one of
them a hassook and a Common Prayer
Book; and, at the same time, employed
an itinerant singing-master, Who goes

besides himself ; for, if by chance he has been surprised A

into a short nap at sermon, upon recovering out of it
he stands up and looks about him, and, if he sees any-
body else nodding, either wakes them himself, or sends
his servants to them. Several other of the old knight’s
particularities break out upon these occasions. Some-
times he will be lengthening out a verse in the singing
Psalms, half a minute after the rest of the congrega-
tion have done with it; sometimes when he is pleased
with the matter of his devotion, he pronounces “Amen ”
three or four times to the same prayer ; and some-

_ times stands up when everybody else is upon their

knees, to count the congregation, or see if any of
his tenants are missing. I was yesterday very much
surprised to hear my old friend, in the midst of the
service, calling out to one John Matthews to mind
what he was about, and not disturb the congregation.
This John Matthews, it seems, is remarkable for being
an idle fellow, and at that time was kicking his heels
for his diversion. . f i

This authority of the knight, though exerted in that
odd manner which accompanies him in all circum-
stances of life, has a very good effect upon the parish,
who are not polite enough to see anything ridiculous in
his behavior; besides that, the general good sense and
worthiness of his character make his friends observe
these little singularities as foils that rather set off than
‘blemish his good qualities. i

As soon as the sermon is ﬁnished, nobody presumes to

stir till Sir Roger is gone out of the church. The knight
walks down from his seat in the chancel between a double
row of his tenants, who stand bowing to him on each
side, and every now and then inquires how such an one’s
wife, or mother, or son, or father do, whom he does not
see at church; which is understood as a secret reprimand
.to the person that is absent. T '

The chaplain has often told me that upon a catechis-
ing day, when Sir Roger has been pleased with a. boy

that answers well, he has ordered a Bible to be given  

him next day for his encouragement, and sometimes
accompanies it with a ‘ﬂitch of bacon to his mother.

Sir Roger has likewise added ﬁve pounds a year to
the clerk’s place; and, that he may encourage the young
fellows to make themselves perfect in the church service,
has promised upon the death of the present incumbent,
who is very old, to bestow it according to merit.

THE MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY.‘

[ABRIDGE:D.]

EDVVARD EVERETT HALE.

EDWARD EVERETT HALE was born in Boston in 1822. He was

named for his uncle, Edward Everett, the celebrated orator. When
six years of age he had begun the study of Latin, and entered Har-

‘ T vard College when he was thir-
teen. Though young Hale was
a diligent student, he excelled
in athletic sports, and his great

now in his large frame and pow-
erful hands and arms.

The future author and
preacher was graduated from
Harvard with honors when he
was seventeen years old. He
assisted his father in newspaper
work, and was able to write
editorials, keep the books, or

 

set type, as the occasion required. He afterwards studied?

theology.

His ﬁrst pastorate was at VVorcester, Mass. He remained
there for ten years. He then settled in Boston. He was with
the Massachusetts Riﬂe Corps when the Civil War’ broke out,
and it was upon an incident of that war that he founded his
story of “ The Man without a Country.” This is one of the
strongest stories of patriotism ever written, and has been re-
printed in several languages. .

For many years Dr. Hale has been pastor of the South" Con-
gregational Church in Boston. He has written many books;

. among them the best known are “ Ten Times One -is Ten” and

30

“ In His Name.”

physical strength is shown even,

->83053<‘°

One can hardly imagine a busier life than he leads. His daily
tasks consist in aiding public and private charities, lecturing,
editing, writing, and preparing his sermons.

He was once asked how he was able to accomplish so much,
and he replied: “ If you are working with Aladdin’s lamp, or

-with Monte Cristo’s treasures, you are not apt to think you will .

fail. Far less is your risk with the omnipotence of the Lord
God behind you.” I .

PHILIP NOLAN was as ﬁne a young oﬂicer as there

was in the “Legion of the West,” as the Western

division of our army was then called. When Aaron
Burr made his ﬁrst dashing expedition down to New

I Orleans, or somewhere above on the river, he met this

gay, dashing, bright young fellow, at some dinner

party, I think. Burr marked him, talked to him,

walked with him, took him a day or two’s voyage in
his ﬂatboat, and, in short, fascinated him, and led
him to turn traitor to his country. 1 I  
Nolan was proved guilty; yet you and I would
never have heard of him, reader, but that when the
president of the court asked him at the close whether
he wished to say anything to show that he had
always been faithful to the United States, he cried
out in a ﬁt of frenzy: “Curse the United States!
I wish I may never hear of the United States
again!” ' I I
I suppose he did not know how the words shocked
old Colonel Morgan, who was holding the court. Half
the ofﬁcers who sat in it had served through the Revo-
lution, and their lives, not to say their necks, had been

10

20,

25

30

10

i 15%

+>83o68<~

risked for the very idea which he so cavalierly cursed .

in his madness.
Morgan called the court into his private room, and

returned in ﬁfteen minutes with a face like a sheet, to”

say: “ Prisoner, hear the sentence of the Court! The
Court decides, subject to the approval of the President,

-that you never hear the name of the United States

again.” a

Nolan laughed; but nobody else laughed. Old
Morgan Was too solemn, and the Whole room was
hushed dead. as night for a minute. Even Nolan lost
his swagger in a moment. Then Morgan added: “ Mr.
Marshal, take the prisoner to Orleans in an armed
boat, and deliver him to the naval commander there.”
The marshal gave his orders and the prisoner Was
taken out of court. S

“ Mr. Marshal,” continued old Morgan, “see that
no one mentions the United States to the prisoner.
Mr. Marshal, make _my respects to Lieutenant Mitchell
at Orleans, and request him to order that no one shall
mention the United States to the prisoner While he is
on board ship.” 2 O p

‘Nolan had the freedom of the ship he Was on, so
long as he heard nothing of his country. No mess
liked to have him permanently, because his presence
cut off all talk of homeor of the prospect of return,
of politics or letters, of peace or of War—cut off

‘more than half the talk men liked to have at sea.
Sometimes, when the marines or sailors had any

~>a3o7 8<+

special jolliﬁcation, they were permitted to invite
“Plain-Buttons,” as they called him. Then Nolan
was sent with some ofiicer, and the men were for-
bidden to speak of home while he was there. I believe
the theory was that the sight of his punishment did
them good. They called him “ Plain-Buttons,” because,
while he always chose to wear a regulation army uni-
form, he was not permitted to wear the army button,

for the reason that it bore either the initials or the

insignia of the country he had disowned.
As hewas almost never permitted to go on shore,
even though the vessel lay in port for months, his

  .‘ time at,the best hung heavy; and everybody was per-

mitted to lend him books, if they were not published
in America and made no allusion to it. He had almost
all foreign papers that came into the ship, sooner
or later; only somebody must go over them ﬁrst, and
cut out any advertisement or stray paragraph that
alluded to America.  

Among these books was the “ Lay of the Last

Q1

10

15

20

Minstrel,” which theyhad 5,11 of them heard er, but i

which most of them had never seen. I think it could
not have been publishedlong. Well, nobody thought
there could be any risk of anything nationalin that, so
Nolan was permitted to join the circle one afternoon
when allot of them sat on deck smoking and reading

25

aloud. Well, so it happened that in his turn Nolan 4

  took thebook and‘ read to the others; and he read

very well, as I know. Nobody in thecircle knew a

»>3:-3088+

line of the poem, only it was all magic and Border chiv-
alry, and Was ten thousand years ago. Poor Nolan read
steadily through tl1e ﬁfth canto, stopped a minute and
then began, Without a thought of What was coming :—

Qt

“ Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath said.”

It seems impossible to us that anybody ever heard this

for the ﬁrst time, but all these fellows did then, and

poor Nolan himself Went on, still unconsciously or
10 mechanically : —

“.‘ This is my own, my native land 1”’

Then they all saw something was to pay ; but he ex-
pected to get through, I suppose, turned a little pale,
but plunged on ;— T

15 “ Whose heart hath ne’er Within him burned,
As home his footsteps he hath turned,
From Wandering on a foreign strand ‘?
If such there breathe, go, mark him Well.”

By this time the men were all beside themselves, wish-
2o ing there Was any Way to make him turn over two

pages ; but he had not quite presence of mind for

that; he colored crimson and staggered on:p-—-

“ For him no minstrel raptures swell ;
High though his titles, proud his name,

25 Boundless his Wealth as wish can claim ;

$>e3o98<~

Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentered all in self,” -

And here the poor fellow choked, could not go on, but
started up, swung the book into the sea, vanished into

. his stateroom, and we did not see him for two months

again. He never read aloud again unless it was the
Bible or Shakespeare, or something else he was sure of.
But it was not that merely.   He never entered in with
the other young men exactly as a companion again.

In one of the great frigate duels with the English, it

i happened that a round-shot from the enemy entered

one of our ports square, and took right down the officer
of the gun himself, and almost every man of the 'gun’s
crew. Now you may say what you choose about courage,
but that is not a nice thing to see. But, as the men
who were not killed picked themselves up, and as they
and the surgeon’s people were carrying off the bodies,
there appeared Nolan, in his shirt V sleeves, with the
rammer in his hand, and, just as if he had been the
officer, told them off with authority——.—who should go
to the cockpit with the wounded men, who should stay
with him —— perfectly cheery, and with that way which
makes men feel sure all is right and is going to be
right. And he ﬁnished loading the gun with his own
hands, aimed it, and bade the men ﬁre. And there he
stayed, captain of that gun, keeping those fellows in

10

20

25

spirits, till the enemy struck, -—-—— sitting on the ‘carriage V

ing Wales. ,
4 where he became deeply interested in the political

—->813.3<*-

he composed his ﬁrst long poem, “An Evening Walk,
Addressed to a Young Lady” [his sister Dorothy].

In the autumn of 1790 Wordsworth and a friend
made a journey, mostly on foot, to Calais, visiting
Switzerland. They wandered across a mountainous
country, and were greatly disappointed when a peas-

ant told them that they had crossed the Alps without A

knowing it. Manya mile did the young men travel

‘together, feasting their eyes upon the wondrous
sscenery:—— >‘ 

“ the ever-living universe,
Turn where I might, was opening out its glories.”

. Wordsworth’s uncle had already urged him to take

orders and become a clergyman, but he could not give

A up his cherished dream of becoming a poet.

10

15

.When he was twenty-one, he received his degree .

and left Cambridge, spending some time with Dorothy.
The faithful sister encouraged her brother to carry out
his purpose, and they took long Walks at morning and
nightfall, talking and planning together. The young
poet then went to London, where he spent several
months and then took another tour, this time visit-
The next winter was spent in France,

affairs of that nation.

Although ,Wordsworth had begun writing verses
when he was a ‘schoolboy, his ﬁrst book of poems,
containing “ An Evening Walk” and “Descriptive

20

25

Sketches,” was not published until he was twenty-

10

while the gun was cooling, though he was exposed all
the time, — showing them easier ways to handle heavy
shot, making the raw hands laugh at their own blun-
ders, and when the gun cooled again, getting it loaded
and ﬁred twice as often as any other gun on the ship.
The captain walked forward by way of encouraging

the men, and Nolan touched his hat and said: “ I am,

showing them how we do this in the artillery, sir.”

The commodore said: “ I see you are, and I thank
you, sir; and I shall never forget this day, sir, and
you never shall, sir.” '

And after the whole thing was over, and he had the
Englishman’s sword, in the midst of the state and
ceremony of the quarter-deck, he said: “ Where is Mr.
Nolan? Ask Mr. Nolan to come here.” ’

And when’Nolan came he said: “ Mr. Nolan, we
are all very grateful to you to—day ; you are one of us
to—day; you will be named in the dispatches.”

And then the old man took off his own sword of
ceremony and gave it to Nolan, and made him put it
on. The man told 1ne this who saw it. Nolan cried

  like a baby, and well he might. He had not worn a

25

sword since that day at Fort Adams. But always
afterwards, on occasions of ceremony, he wore that
quaint old French sword of the commodore’s.

I ﬁrst came to understand anything about “ the man

‘without a country ” one day when we overhauled a
dirty little schooner which had slaves on board. , An

ﬂ

*>83l18<“-.

officer Was sent to take charge of her, and after a few T

minutes he sent back his boat to ask that some one

might be sent him who could speak Portuguese. Nolan .

stepped out and said he should be glad to interpret if
the captain Wished, as he understood the language.

“ Tell them they are free,” said Vaughan. .

. d Then there was a yell of delight, clinching of ﬁsts,
leaping and dancing, kissing of Nolan’s feet.

“Tell them,” said Vaughan, well pleased, “that I
will take them all to Cape Palmas.”

This did not answer so well. Cape Palmas Was
practically as far from the homes of most of them as
New Orleans or Rio Janeiro Was; thatis, they would
be eternally separated from home there. And their
interpreters, as We could understand, instantly said:
“Ah, non Palmas.”
White forehead as he hushed the men down and said:
“ He says, ‘Not Palmas.’ He says, ‘Take us home,
take us to our- own country, take us to our own house,
take us to our own pickaninnies and our own Women.’

  He says he has an old father and mother Who Will die

if they do not see him. And this one says he left his
people all sick, and paddled down to Fernando to beg
the White doctor to come and help them, and that
these caught him in the bayijust in sight of home,
and that he has never seen anybody from home since
then. And thisone says,” choked out Nolan, “that

the has not,-heard aword from his home in six months,
  While hehas been locked up in a barracoon.”

[XS quick as Vaughan could get words, he said:
“Tell them yes, yes, yes ; tell them they shall go to
the mountains of the Moon, if they will. If I sail the

schooner through the Great White Desert, they shall
go home.” a
And after some fashion Nolan said so. And then

they all fell to kissing him again, and wanted to ru

his nose with theirs.    
But he could not stand it long ; and getting Vaughan
to say he might go back, he beckoned me down into
our boat. As we lay back in the stern sheets and the
men gave way, he said to 1ne: “Youngster, let that
show you what it is to be without a family, without a
home, and without a country. And if you are ever
tempted to say a word or to do a thing that shall put
a bar between you and your family, your home and
your country, pray God in his mercy to take you that
instant home to his own heaven. Stick by your family,
boy; forget you have a self, while you'do everything
for them. Think of your home, boy; write and send,
and talk about it. Let it be nearer and nearer to your
thought, the farther you have to travel from it; and
rush back to it when you are free, as that poor black
slave is doing now. And for your country, boy,” and
the words rattled in his throat, “and for that ﬂag,”

of serving her as she bids you, though the service

do with, behind oﬂicers and government, and people
even, there is the Country Herself, your Country, and
that you belong to Her as you belong to your own
mother. Stand by Her, boy, as you would stand by
your mother.”  

I was frightened to death by his calm, hard passion ;
but I blundered out that I would by all that was holy,
and that I had never thought of doing anything else.

a whisper, sayzi “ Oh, if anybody had

Extract from a letter written in 1863: -

“DEAR FRED: « LEVANT, 2° 2' s. @ 131° w.

I try to ﬁnd heart and life to tell yoiu_that it is all over with
dear old Nolan. The doctor has been watching him very care-
fully, and yesterday morning came to me and told me that Nolan
was not so well, and he said he should like to see me. I Well, I
went in, and there, to be sure, the poor fellow lay in his berth,
smiling pleasantly as he gave me his hand, but looking very
frail. I could not help a glance round, which showed me what
a little shrine he had made of the box he was lying in. The
stars and stripes were triced up above and around a picture of
Washington, and he had painted a majestic eagle, with light-
nings blazing from his beak, and his foot just clasping the whole
globe, which his wings overshadowed. The dear old boy saw

place Where he had marked the text: ‘They desire a country,

THE HEROINE OF NANCY.

IN the year 1476, Charles the Bold, Duke of Bur- V
gundy,laid siege to thetown of Nancy, capital of the

duchy of Lorraine. In the absence of the young duke,
Rene II., who had gone to raise troops among the ene-

mies of Charles, the town and its little garrison were

i governor, addressing the people.

property if We will accept him as our ruler 3 but be not

dear.  

"“ But if not for our own sakes,” he Went on, “then

tinue the glorious struggle. Already at the head of a
brave Swiss army, he is hastening to our relief. He

Thus defended, Nancy held out until Charles, madn
dened to fury by so unexpected and so prolonged a

resistance, made a ﬁnal, desperate attempt to carry the

town. By stratagem, quite as much as by force, he
succeeded in gaining an entrance within the Walls ;
and Nancy was at his mercy.

In the ﬂush of vengeance and success, he was for
putting at once all the inhabitants——men, women, and
chi1dren—to the sword. A young maiden was brought
before him. L p

“ Barbarian! ” she cried, “ if We are all to perish, over
Whom Will you reign?”

“ Who are you, bold girl! that dare to speak to me
thus?” said the astonished Charles.

‘ young girl was no other than Télésile.

->83188l<+

Her beauty, her courage, and the prophetic tones in
which she spoke, arrested Charles’s fury.

“ Give up to me your governor, whom I have sworn
to punish,” he said, “ and a portion of the inhabitants
shall be spared.”

But the governor Was her own father, — for the
Listening to
the entreaties of his friends, he had assumed the dress
of a private citizen; and all loved the good old man
too Well to point him out to the tyrant.

When Télésile sorrowfully reported to her father the
duke’s Words, he smiled. “ Be of good cheer; my daugh-
ter I ” he said. “ I Will see the Duke Charles, and try
What I can do to persuade him.”

When brought before the conqueror, he said, “ There  

is but one man who can bring the governor to you.

‘ Swear on yoursword to spare all the inhabitants of the

20

25

town, and he shall be given up.”

“That Will I not!” cried the angry duke- “They
have braved my power too long; they have scorned my
offers; theyhave laughed at my threats; now Woe.to
the people of Nancy! ”  
’ Then, turning to his oﬂicers, he commanded that every

tenth person in the town should be slain, and they at  

once gave orders for the decimation. The inhabitants,
young and old, women and infants, were assembled in
a line which extended through the principal street of the
city; While soldiers ransacked the houses, in order to
drive forth or kill any that might remain concealed.

»>a3193<+ 

It was a terrible day for the doomed city. Families
clung together, friends embraced friends; some weep-
ing and lamenting, some trying to comfort and sustain ‘
those who were weaker than they, others calmly await-
ing their fate.   i ’ 5

Then, at a Word from the conqueror, a herald went
forth, and, Waving his hand before the gathered multi-
tude, began to count. Each on whom fell the fatal
number ten was to be given at once to the sword. But
at the outset a diﬂiculty arose.   10

Near the head of the line Télésile and the governor

_ were placed; and the devoted girl, watching the move-

ments of the herald, and hearing him count aloud, saw
by a rapid glance that the dreaded number was about
to fall upon her father. Quick as thought, she slipped is
behind him and placed herself at his other side. Before,
the old man was aware of her object, the doom which
should have been his had fallen upon his daughter. He
stood for a moment stupeﬁed with astonishment and

grief, then called out to the herald, “ Justice! justice! ” 26 A

.“ What is the matter, old man ?” demanded the her-
ald, before passing on. i
“' The count is wrong! there is a mistake ! Not her!”

hands upon Télésile ; “ take me, for I was the tenth!” 25
“Not so,” said Télésile calmly. “ You all saw that
the number cameto me.”

three. These poems attracted very little attention,
and did not have a rapid sale, but they were appre-
ciated by a few, who recognized the true spirit of poetry
in them.

His relatives were disappointed in him and thought
him a hopeless and idle dreamer. Dorothy Wrote

one of her friends :‘ “ This favorite brother of mine

happens to be no favorite with any of his near rela-
tives except his brothers, by whom he is adored.”
His sister understood him and encouraged him con-
tinually; She was devoted to him, and they ‘planned
to have a home together as soon as he had sufficient
means.

About this time Wordsworth began to write for a
London paper. In 1795 a friend whom he had nursed
during his last illness left-him a legacy of nine hun-
dred pounds. With this sum the brother and sister
began house-keeping in a modest little cottage. Here,
far from the world, but surrounded with beautiful
scenery, they read, walked, talked, and wrote verses.

In this quiet home the poet listened to his own thoughts .

and to the messages that the tiniest dewdrop held for
him. He wrote: “ To me, the meanest ﬂower that
blows can give thoughts that lie too deep for tears.”

At this time he made the acquaintance of Samuel
T. Coleridge, and the two poets became lifelong friends.

Coleridge visited Wordsworth at his home, and was i

charmed with him and his sister. In 1797 Words-
worth moved to Alfoxden, where Coleridge and his

while she as earnestly insisted that she was the rightly
chosen victim.

Amazed to see two persons striving for the privilege
of death at their hands, the butchers dragged them
before Charles the Bold, that he might decide the
question between them. p

Charles was no less surprised at beholding once more
the maiden and the old man who had already appeared
before him, and at learning the cause of their strange
dispute 5 for he knew not yet that they were parent and

  child. . Notwithstanding his violentdisposition, the con-

queror had a heart which pity could sometimes touch,

and he was powerfully moved by the sight that met
his eyes. a i

“ I pray you hear me I ” cried Télésile, throwing her- ,

self at his feet. “ I am a simple maiden ; my life is of
But spare,
oh, spare him, the best, the noblest of men, whose life
is useful to all our unhappy people! ”

“Do not listen to her!” exclaimed the old man,

almost too much affected to speak; “ or if you do, let ,

her own words confute her argument. You behold her
courage, her piety, her self-sacriﬁce ; and I see you are
touched! Youiwill not, you cannot, destroy so precious
a life 1 It is I who am now worthless to my people.
My days are almost spent. Even if you spare me, I
have but a little while to live.”

Then Télésile, perceiving the eyes of Charles bent
upon her with a look of mingled admiration and pity,

\ said: “ Do not think there.1s anything wonderful 111 my‘

 conduct ; I do but  my simple duty; I plead for my
 father’s life ! ”
 “ Yes, I am her father,” said the old man, moved by

 

 a sudden determination. “ And I am something more. 5 I

;,‘iT"c“‘”‘";‘I3 My lord duke, behold the man on whom you have sworn
to have revenge. I am he who defended the city so
  long against you. Now let me die! ”

 p At this a multitude of people broke from the line in _
 which they had been ranged, and, surrounding the gov- 10
. ernor and hisdaughter, made a rampart of their bodies
3  about them, exclaiming, “ Let us die for him! We will
"I die for our good governor! ”

6 All the better part of the rude Charles’s nature was
roused. Tears were in‘ his own eyes, his voice'was 15
shaken by emotion. “ Neither shall die!” he cried.
__l‘<‘,Old man! fair maiden! I spare your lives and, for ‘
 your sake, the lives of all these people. Nay, do not

‘Well would it have been for the rash Charles could

Warrnly as he was welcomed, there were two who

AN ICEBERG.
RICHARD H. DANA, JR.

RICHARD H-ENRY DANA, J R., was born in Cambridge, Mass.,
in 1815, and died in 1882.

He was educated at Harvard College. During his course there
his eyesight became affected, and he was obliged to leave college
for a time. ‘

Beingadvised to take a sea voyage, he shipped for California
and spent two years as a common sailor. On his return he pub-
lished an account of his adventures, entitled “ Two Years before
This book became popular both in England and
America. It is still widely read. C

Mr. Dana was admitted to the bar when he was twenty-five
years old, and always held a prominent position as a lawyer and
writer.

THIS day thesun rose fair, but it ran too low in the
heavens to give any heat, or thaw out our sails and
rigging; yet the sight of it was pleasant, and we had
a steady “ reef-topsail breeze ” from the westward. The
atmosphere, which had previously been clear and cold,
for the last few hours - grew damp and had a disagree-
able, wet chilliness in it; and the man who came from
the wheel said he heard the captain tell “ the passen-
ger” that the thermometer had fallen several degrees
since morning, which he could not account for in any
other way than by supposing that there must be ice
near us, though such a thing was rarely heard of in
this latitude at this season of the year.

At twelve o’clock. we went below, and had just got
through dinner when the cook put his head down the
scuttle and told us to come on deck and see the ﬁnest
sight that we had ever seen.
asked the ﬁrst man who was up. “ On the larboard
bow.” And there lay, ﬂoating in the ocean, several

“miles off, an immense, irregular mass, its top and

points covered with snow, and its center of a deep
indigo color. This was an iceberg, and of the largest
size, as one of our men said who had been in the North-
ern Ocean. As far as the eye could reach, the sea in
every direction was of a deep blue color, the waves run-
ning high and fresh, and sparkling in the light 3 and in

the midst lay this immense mountain-island, its cavities -

and valleys thrown into deep shade, and its points and
pinnacles glittering in the sun.

All hands were soon on deck looking at it, and admir-
ing, in various ways, its beauty and grandeur. But no
description can give any idea of the strangeness, splen-
dor, and really the sublimity of the sight, Its great
size, —for it must have been from two to three miles
in circumference, and several hundred feet in height, —

its slow motion, as its base rose and sank in the water i

and its high points nodded against the clouds ; the dash-
ing of the waves upon it, which, breaking high with
foam, lined its base with a white crust; and the thun-
dering sound of the cracking of the mass, and the break-

A ing and tumbling down of huge pieces, together with its

nearness and approach, which added to a slight element

“ Where away, doctor?” -

of fear, all combined to give to it the character of true
sublimity.

The main body of the mass was, as I have said, of
an indigo color, its base crusted with foam, and, as it
grew thin and transparent towards the edges and top,
its color shaded off from a deep blue to the whiteness
of snow. It seemed to be drifting slowly towards the
north, so that we kept away and avoided it. It was in

sight all the afternoon, and when we got to leeward of  

it the wind died away, so that we lay to quite near it
for a greater part of the night.

Unfortunately there was no moon; but it was as clear
night, and we could plainly mark the long, regular heav-
ing of the stupendous mass, as its edges moved slowly
against the stars, now revealing them and now shutting
them in. Severaltimes in our watch loud cracks were
heard, which sounded as though they must have run
through the whole length of the iceberg, and several
pieces fell down with a thundering crash, plunging
heavily into the sea. i

JOHN MILTON.

JOHN MILTON was born in 1608, in a house called
“ The Spread Eagle,” in the Very heart of old London.

His father, also John Milton, was a scrivener or law-
yer, and was well known as a musical composer. p He

a ,1 - "-or had received a good
education and took
great pains with his
son, employing pri-
vate tutors for him,
and afterwards send-
ing him to St. Paul’s
school, where he was
for some time’ a day
scholar.

The boy was as
desirous of an edu-
cation as his father
. could wish, and be-

came so interested in his books that he would read and
20 study until after midnight.

-His compositions and Verses attracted attention dur-
ing his early boyhood. Before he was sixteen years old
he had written two of the Psalms in verse.

While at St. Paul’s he formed a close friendship

25 with Charles Diodati, the son of an exiled ltaiian phy-
sician. This friendship aroused Milton’s interest in

Italian literature.

~>83278<‘-

Milton entered Christ’s College, C-ambridge, when he '

was seventeen years old, remaining there seven years.
The handsome, graceful young man, with his scorn of

. all that lacked reﬁnement, Was not popular during the

ﬁrst years of his college course, and the students called
him “ The Lady.” r

They soon learned to honor his high -

character and brilliant scholarship. He was regarded _

as the best student of the university.

He had at ﬁrst intended to become a clergyman, but
gave up this plan and was uncertain as to what he
should do. His father had taken a house at Horton,
about twenty miles from London, and, after leaving
Cambridge, Milton spent ﬁve years at home, studying
Greek and Latin, taking solitary walks, and writing
wonderful verses. ,He also continued the study of
music under his father’s teaching, and took great
delight in it. Some of his most famous poems were
written during those years at Horton. o

Milton had long desiredto travel, and after the death
of his mother he found his home so lonely that he per-
suaded his father to allow him to visit France, Italy,
and Switzerland. This journey occupied nearly sixteen
months, andwas a season of delight to the young poet,

_ Who, by reading, had become familiar with these old

cities and the famous men who had walked their
streets. He also became acquainted with many learned

. men and persons of rank, and was received everywhere

with courteous attention. During his stay at Florence

10

15

20

25

he met the astronomer, Galileo, then old and blind, and  

~>832834"

recently released from prison, where he had been con-
ﬁned on account of his theories and discoveries.

The house at Horton was occupied but a short time
after Milton’s return. His father went to live with
his son Christopher, and the poet went to London. He
hired a pretty “ garden—house,” large enough for himself

' and his books, andilived there with his two nephews,
7 of whose education he took charge.’ He was fond of

10

15

20

teaching, and gradually several other boys joined the
class, and his house became a small private school.

In the spring of his thirty-ﬁfth year Milton went to
Oxford and returned amonth later, bringing home a
bride and a party of her relatives. After several days
spent in feasting, the young wife of seventeen summers
was left alone with her husband, who became once more
absorbed in his books. Mrs. Milton cared nothing for

literature, and before the summer was over she went to

visit her father, promising to return during September.
She refused to go home at the appointed time and
remained away for two years.

During the meantime Milton’s father had come to

‘ live with him, and the number of his pupils had so

25

increased that he had taken a larger house. After the
death of his father, Milton decided to devote more time

"to writing, so he dismissed his pupils and removed to a

smaller house. He became deeply interested in politics,
writing some bold and daring essays on the questions of

H the day. When he was forty years old he was appointed
Secretary of Foreign Tongues, witha large salary and

a residence in Whitehall Palace in Scotland Yard. His
eyesight had begun to fail, and three years after accept-
ing this ofﬁce he became blind. He continued, however,
to attend to his duties with the aid of two assistants.
Shortly after he lost his sight his wife died, leaving
three little daughters. Fouryears later he married a
second time, but this wife lived but a short time.

In 1660, when Milton was ﬁfty-two years old, there
came another. change in the government, and 'lV.[ilton’s
life wasin danger. He was obliged to hide for several
months. Life seemed Very gloomy to the blind man.
His friends were dead or in exile, he had lost a large
share of his property, and his work during thelast
twenty yearsseemed thrown away.

wife were staying,,so that he might enjoy their society.

This close friendship brought him into touch with other-

literary men, and he became acquainted with Robert
Southey and Charles Lamb.

Meanwhile his pen was active and some of his most
beautiful poems were written. “ It was,” says Words-
worth, “ a very pleasant and proﬁtable time of my life.”

' The next summer, during a tour with his sister along

the river Wye, he wrote “ Tintern Abbey,” an exquisite

poem which was published early in September of that

year in his volume of “Lyrical Ballads.’-’ ‘
Shortly afterwards the Wordsworths left their home

' at Alfoxden, and spent the winter at the foot of the

Hartz mountains. It was bitterly cold and nothing
could have been more dreary than this season at
Goslar; but the poet’s heart turned with longing to
old scenes, and some of the poems written among
these bleak and wintry surroundings are ﬁlled with
the breath of springtide and nature’s most smiling
moods. C s r ‘-
The next December, the brother’ and sister went to
live at Dove Cottage, Grasmere. , They had been travel-

, ing for four days, much of the way on foot, but such

was their delight in nature that Wordsworth wrote

Coleridge an enthusiastic account of their journey :—

f‘ The frostywind, as if to make amends
For its keen breath, was aiding to our steps,
And drove us onward like two ships at sea
Or like two birds, companions in mid-air.”

Many years before, Milton had planned to Write his

great poem of “ Paradise Lost.” He now devoted him-
self to this Work, dictating it to Dorothy, his youngest
and favo_rite child, Who bore some resemblance to her
5 father, and who was most in sympathy With him.
Milton married for the third time during his ﬁfty-
iﬁfth year. This wife proved a blessing to him. She
Was a lover of music, and sang to him while he accom-
panied her upon the organ or bass viol. They walked

10 together and talked about his favorite books and men of

learning. His poem “ Paradise Lost ” was ﬁnished dur-
ing the next tWo years. He loaned a copy toa friend,
who suggested his Writing “ Paradise Regained,” which
was published about four years later. i T

15 These poems rank as the grandest Works of one of
the greatest minds that the World has ever known.
The poet’s humble home became an attraction for
many visitors, Who Wished to look upon and talk with
the man Whose genius was so great.

20 Milton died in 1674.

DEATH OF SAMSON. »

JOHN MILTON.

Scene — In Gaza.

, OCCASIONS drew me early to this city;
a And, as the gates I entered with sunrise,

The morning trumpets festival proclaimed

Through each high street 2% little I had dispatched,
When all abroad was rumored that this day
Samson should be brought forth, to show the people
Proof of his mighty strength in feats and games;

I sorrowed at his captive state, but minded

Not to be absent at that spectacle}

The building was a spacious theater

‘ Half-round, on two main pillars vaulted high,

With seats, where all the lords, and each degree
Of sort, might sit in order to behold,

The other side was open, where the throng

On banks and scaffolds under sky might stand ;

W I among these, aloof, obscurely stood.

The feast and noon grew high, and sacriﬁce

Had ﬁlled their hearts with mirth, high cheer, andwine,

When to their sports they turned. Immediately
Was Samson as a public servant brought, A
In their state livery clad; before him pipes

,And timbrels, on each side went armed guards,

+>833é8<+

Both horse and foot; before him and behind
Archers and slingers, cataphracts and spears.

At sight of him the people with a shout

Rifted the air, clamoring their god with praise,
Who had made their dreadful enemy their thrall.

He, patient, but undaunted, where they led him,

Came to the place; and what Was set before him,
Which without help of eye might be essayed,

To heave, pull, draw, or break, he still performed,
All with incredible, stupendous force,

None daring to appear antagonist.

At length, for intermission sake, they led him
Between the pillars; he his guide requested,

“ As over-tired, to let him lean awhile

With both his arms on those two massy pillars,
That to the arched roof gave main support.

He, unsuspicious, led him; which when Samson
Felt in his arms, with head awhile inclined,

And eyes fast ﬁxed he stood, as one who prayed,
Or some great matter in his mind revolved ;

At last, with head erect, thus cried aloud:

“ Hitherto, lords, what your commands imposed
I have performed, as reason was, obeying,

Not without wonder or delight beheld :

Now, of my own accord, such other trial

I mean to show you of my strength, yet greater,

As with amaze shall strike all who behold.”

-#83338“

This uttered, straining all his nerves, he bowed;
As with the force of winds and waters pent,
When mountains tremble, those two massy pillars
With horrible convulsion to and fro

He tugged, he shook, till down they came, and drew

The whole roof after them, with burst of thunder,
Upon the heads of all who sat beneath, —

Lords, ladies, captains, counselors, or priests,
Their choice nobility and ﬂower, not only

Of this, but each Philistian city round,

Met from all parts to solemnize this feast.

, Samson, with these immixed, inevitably
‘Pulled down the same destruction on himself;

The Vulgar only ’scaped who stood without.

From “ Samson A gonisies. ”

MAY MORNING.
JOHN MILTON.

Now the bright morning star, Day’s harbinger,
Comes dancing from the east, and leads with her
The ﬂowery May, who from her green lap throws

    The yellow cowslip and the pale primrose.

Hail, bounteous May, that dost inspire
Mirth, and youth, and warm desire!
Woods and groves are of thy dressing;
Hill anddale doth boast thy blessing.
Thus we salute thee with our early song,
And welcome thee, and wish thee long.

ON HIS BLINDNESS.
JOHN MILTON.

WHEN I consider how my light is spent,
«Ere half my days, in this dark World and Wide,
And that one talent which is death to hide
Lodged With me useless, though my soul more bent
To serve therewith my Maker, and present
My true account, lest He returning chide;
“Doth God exact day-labor, light denied?”
I fondly ask; but Patience, to prevent

‘That murmur, soon replies, “ God doth not need

Either man’s Work or his own gifts; who best
Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best; his state
Is kingly: thousands at his bidding speed,
’ And post o’er land and ocean without rest;
They also serve Who only stand and Wait.” ‘

How charming is divine philosophy!

Not harsh and crabbed, as dull fools suppose,
But musical as is Apollo’s lute,

And a perpetual feast of nectared sweets,
Where no crude surfeit reigns.

A CHEERFUL SPIRIT.
SIR JOHN LUBBOCK.

SIR JOHN LUBBOCK was born in England in 1834. He is a
banker and has introduced great improvements into banking and
custom-house business.

He has written a_ number of books on literary and scientiﬁc
subjects. - _, _ 5

CHEERFULNESS is a great moral tonic. As sunshine  
brings out the ﬂowers and ripens the fruit, so does cheer-
fulness—the feeling of freedom and life —develop in s

_ us all the seeds of good—all that is best in us.

Cheerfulness is a duty we owe to others. There is 10
an old tradition that a cup of gold is to be found Wher-
ever a rainbow touches the earth, and there are some
people whose smile, the sound of whose voice, whose
very presence seems like a ray of sunshine, to turn
everything they touch into gold. 15

Men never break down as long as they can keep
cheerful. “Ag merry heart is a continual feast” to
others besides itself. The shadow of Florence Night-
ingale cured more than her medicines; and if we share

the burdens of others, we lighten our own. 20%

All wish, but few know how, to enjoy themselves.
They do not realize the dignity and delight of life.

Do not magnify small troubles into great trials. We‘
often fancy we are mortally wounded when we are but

scratched. A surgeon, says Fuller, p“ sent for to cure a 25 a

slight wound,sent off in a great hurry for a plaster.

->83368<-

‘Why,’ said the gentleman, ‘is the hurt then so dan-
gerous ?’ ‘ N o,’ said the surgeon, ‘ but if the messenger
returns not in post-haste, it will cure itself.’ ” Time
cures sorrow as well as wounds.
5 “ A cultivated mind, I do not mean that of a philoso-
pher, but any mind to which the fountains of knowledge
have been opened, andwhich has been taught in any
tolerable degree to exercise its faculties, will ﬁnd sources
of inexhaustible interest in all that surrounds it; in the
10 objects of Nature, the achievements of Art, the imagi-
nation of Poetry, the incidents of History, the ways of
Mankind, past and present, and their prospects in the
future.” ’ From “ The Pleasures of Life.”

THE RELIEF OF LUCKNOW.

FOR eighty days the fort of Lucknow had held out

i 15 against ﬁfty thousand rebel Sepoys. Disease, famine,

and the ﬁre of the enemy had thinned the ranks of the
little garrison until but twenty remained. Day after
day the garrison had hoped for relief, but now hope

itself had died away. The Sepoys, grown desperate  
20 by repulse, had decided to overwhelm the fort with

their whole force. The engineers had said that within
a few hours all would be over, and not a soul within
Lucknow but was prepared for the worst.

A poor Scotch girl, Jessie Brown, had been in a

.25 state of excitement all through the siege, and had

fallen away visibly within the last few days. »A con-
stant fever consumed her, and lfer mind wandered,
especially on that day, when, as she said, she was
“ lukin far awa, far awa upon the craigs of Duncleuch
as in the days of auld lang syne.” At last, overcome
with fatigue, she sank on the ground too tired to wait.

A As the Sepoys moved on to the attack, the women,
remembering the horrible scenes of Cawnpore, besought
the men to save them from a fate worse than death,
by killing them with a volley from their guns. The
soldiers for the last time looked down the road whence
the long-looked-for relief must come; but they saw no
In despair they
loaded their guns and aimed them at the waiting group;

but suddenly all are startled by a wild, unearthly

shriek from the sleeping Scotch girl. Starting up-
right, her arms raised, and her head bent forward in
the attitude of listening, with a look of intense delight
breaking over her countenance, she exclaimed: “ Dinna
ye hear it? Dinna ye hear it? Ay, I ’m no dreamin’;
it ’s the slogan o’ the Highlanders ll We ’re saved,
we ’re saved! ” Then, ﬂinging herself upon her knees,

- she-thanked God with passionate fervor.  

The soldiers were utterly bewildered; their English
ears heard only the roar of artillery, and they thought
poor Jessie still raving. But she darted to the bat-
teries, crying, incessantly to the men: “ Courage!
Hark to the slogan—to the Macgregor, the grandest
of them a’! Here ’s help at last!” For a moment

every soul listened in intense anxiety. Gradually, how-
ever, there was a ‘murmur of bitter disappointment,
and the wailing of the women began anew as the
colonel shook his head. Their dull Lowland ears
heard nothing but the rattle of the musketry.

so clear and piercing that it was heard along the whole
line: “.Wi11 ye no believe it noo? The slogan has

At that moment they seem to hear the voice of God
in the distance, as the bagpipes of the Highlanders
brought tidings of deliverance; for now there was no
longer any doubt of their coming. That shrill, pene-

trating, ceaseless sound which rose above all other

sounds could come neither from the advance of the
enemy nor from the work of the sappers.

Yes!
pipes, now shrill and harsh as the threatening venge-
ance of the foe, then in softer tones seeming to promise
succor to their friends in need. Never, surely, was
there such a scene as that which followed. Not a
heart in the residency of Lucknow but bowed‘ itself
before God. All by one simultaneous impulse fell
upon their knees, and nothing was heard save burst-

 ing sobs and the murmured voice of prayer.

THE BIVOUAC OF THE DEAD.
THEODORE O’HARA..

THE muffled drum’s sad roll has beat
The soldier’s last tattoo;

No more on life’s parade shall meet
That brave and fallen few.

On Fame’s eternal camping-ground
Their silent tents are spread,

And glory guards with solemn round,
The bivouac of the dead.

No rumor of the foe’s advance
Now swells upon the Wind ;

No troubled thought at midnight haunts
Of loved ones left behind;

No vision of the morroW’s strife
The Warrior’s dream alarms;

No braying horn or screaming ﬁfe
At dawn shall call to arms.

The neighing troop, the ﬂashing blade,
The bugle’s stirring blast,

The charge, the dreadful cannonade,
The din and shout, are past.

Nor War’s wild note, nor glory’s peal,
Shall thrill With ﬁerce delight

Those breasts that nevermore may feel
The rapture of the ﬁght. .

Dove Cottage is still standing by the roadside close to

Wordsworth set out may still be found. It was here
that he wrote “ To a Butterﬂy,” “ To the Small Celan-

ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCH-YARD.
THOMAS GRAY.

THoMAs GRAY was born in London in 1716. His father
neglected his family, and the boy was dependent upon his
mother, who worked hard to provide her son with an education.

Through the inﬂuence of an uncle, who was an assistant at
Eton, the future poet was educated at that famous school, and
at Cambridge. He spent his vacations
at his uncle’s house. He cared nothing
for the sports of the times, but loved
nature. He would sit for hours in a
quiet nook, surrounded by hills and
cliffs, reading, dreaming, and watching
the gambols of the hares and squirrels.

Gray was twenty-two years old
when he left Cambridge. He spent
the following six months at home, and
then accepted the invitation of one of
his college friends to accompany him,
free of expense, on a tour through
France and Italy. His notes and letters written during this
trip show remarkable taste and learning.

After two and a half years of travel he returned to England.
His father died during the next fall, after wasting his fortune.
Gray began the study of law, but had not the means to ﬁnish the
course. He began to devote his time to writing, left London,
where he had spent the winter, and went with his mother to
visit an uncle who lived in a country hamlet called Stoke Poges.
In this quiet village he wrote his “ Ode on the Spring,” “ Ode
on a Distant Prospect of Eton College,” and began the “Elegy
VVritten in a Country Church—Yard.”

The “ Elegy ” is one of the most celebrated poems ever written.
It was begun when Gray was twenty-six years old, but he did not

->834-33*‘

ﬁnish it until eight years later. Its fame spread over the world,
and it still holds its rank as the most perfect of English poems-

The poet lived at -Cambridge, where he devoted his time to
study. The “ Elegy ” and a later work, “ The Bard,” placed him
at the head of English poets. He was offered the office of poet 5
laureate, which he refused.

In 1768 Gray accepted the chair of Modern History and Lan-
guages at Cambridge.

The last years of the poet’s life were spent very quietly. He
avoided society‘ and was rarely seen in public. He died in 10
London in 1771. "

THE Curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
The lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea,
The plowman homeward plods his weary way,

And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

N ow fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,

‘ And all the air a solemn stillness holds,

Save where the beetle, wheels his droning ﬂight,
And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;

Save that from yonder ivy—mantled tow’r
The moping owl does to the moon complain

Of such, as wand’ring near her secret bow’r,
Molest her ancient solitary reign.

Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree’s shade,
Where heaves the turf in many a mould’ring heap,

Each in his narrow cell forever laid,

The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.

CHURCH AT STOKE POGES.

The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,

The swallow tWitt’ring from the stra,w—built shed,
The oook’s shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,

A N o more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.
For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,‘

Or busy housewife ply her evening care :
’ Noohildren run to lisp their sire’s return,

Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.

Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,

Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;
How joound did they drive their team aﬁeld I '
How boW’d the Woods beneath their sturdy stroke!
Let not Ambition mook their useful toil,
Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;

-+834-58<+

Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile,
The short and simple annals of the poor.

The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow’r,
And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave,
Awaits alike th’ inevitable hour.
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.

Nor you, ye Proud, impute to These the fault,
If Mem’ry o’er their Tomb no Trophies raise,
Where thro’ the long-drawn isle and fretted vault
The pealing anthem swells the note of praise

Can storied urn or animated bust

Back to its mansion call the ﬂeeting breath?
Can Honor’s voice provoke the silent dust,

Or Flatt’ry soothe the dull cold ear of Death?

Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
, Some heart once pregnant with celestial ﬁre;
Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway’d,
Or wak’d to ecstasy the living lyre.  

T But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page

Rich with the spoils of time did ne’er unroll;

Chill Penury repress’d‘their noble rage,

And froze the genial current of the soul.

Full many a gem of purest ray serene,
The dark unfathom’d caves of ocean bear:

4834689-

Full many a ﬂower is born to blush unseen,
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.

’%ome Village-Hampden, thatwith dauntless breast
The little Tyrant of his ﬁelds withstood;
Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,

Some Cromwell guiltless of his country’s blood.

Th’ applause of list’ning senates to command,
The threats of pain and ruin to despise,

To scatter plenty o’er a smiling land,
And read their hist’ry in a nation’s eyes,

Their lot forbade : nor circumscrib’d alone
Their growing Virtues, but their crimes conﬁn’,d ;

Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,
And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,

The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,
To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,  
Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride
With incense kindled at the Muse’s ﬂame.

Far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife,
Their sober wishes never learn’d to stray;
Along the cool sequester’d Vale of life
They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.

~ Yet ev’n these bones from insult to protect
Some frail memorial still erected nigh,

+8347 84*-

With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck’d,
Implores the passing tribute of a sigh. i

Their name, their years, spelt by th’ unletter’d muse,

The place of fame and elegy supply: i
And many a holy text around she strews,
W That teach the rustic moralist to die.

. For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,

‘This pleasing anxious being e’er resign’d,
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
Nor cast one longing ling’ring look behind?

On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
Some pious drops the closing eye requires;

EV’n from the tomb the Voice of Nature cries,
EV’n in our Ashes live their Wonted Fires.

For thee, who mindful of th’ unhonor’d Dead
Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
Some kindred Spirit shall inquire thy fate,

Haply some hoary-headed Swain may say,
fOft have we seen him at the peep of dawn

‘Brushing with hasty steps the dews away
‘ To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

‘ There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
‘ That wreathesi its old fantastic roots so high,

‘ His listless len.gth at noontide would he stretch,
‘ And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

‘Hard by yon Wood, now smiling as in scorn,

‘ Mutt’ring his wayward fancies he would rove,
‘Now drooping, woeful Wan, like one forlorn,

‘ Or craz’d with care, or cross’d in hopeless love.

‘ One morn I n1iss’d him on the custom’d hill,
‘Along the heath and near his faV’rite tree;

And Melancholy mar/c’d him for her own.

Heav’n did a recompense as largely send:
He gave to ]l[is’ry all he had, a tear, F .

He gain’d from Heav’n (’ticas all he icish’d) a friend.

No farther seek his merits to disclose,
Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
(There they alike in trembling hope repose,)
The bosom of his Father and his God.

BELSHAZZAR’S FEAST.

BELSHAZZAR the king made a great feast to a thou-
sand of his lords, and drank Wine before the thousand.
Belshazzar, While he tasted the Wine, commanded to
bring the golden and silver Vessels, which his father

a N ebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which

Was in Jerusalem; that the king and his princes an
his Wives might drink therein. ‘

Then they brought the golden Vessels that 'Were taken T

out of the temple of the house of God, which was at
Jerusalem; and the king, his princes and his wives,

in drank in them.

They drank Wine, and praised the gods of go1d,,and
of silver, of brass, of iron, of Wood, and of stone. '

In the same hour came forth ﬁngers of a man’s
hand, and Wrote over against the candlestick upon the
plaster of the Wall of the king’s palace: and the king
saw the part of the hand that Wrote.

Then the king’s countenance Was changed, and his
thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins
Were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.
The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the
Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And theking spake
and said to the Wise men of Babylon: “Whosoever

10

shall read this Writing, and show me the interpretation A

thereof, shall be clothed With scarlet, and have a chain
of gold about his neck, and shall be thethird ruler in
the kingdom.”

In 1803 Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy went to
Scotland, and there met Sir Walter Scott. They were
impressed by the love and respect with which Scott
was everywhere received. Two years later Scott and
his wife returned this visit and were delighted with
their reception at the humble cottage at Grasmere.

— In 1813 Rydal Mount being vacant, the family

.moved there, where they remained the rest of VVords-

worth’s life. The home at Rydal was a gray cottage,
almost hidden by ivy and roses, with a picturesque, old-
fashioned garden.

“The Excursion” and “The White Doe of Byl-

S stone” appeared during the year 1815.

When he was from sixty to seventy years of age,

  Wordsworth reached the height of his popularityeand

was looked upon as the distinguished poet of the period.
He still retained his simplicity and rustic ways, and
enjoyed a ramble with a little child as well as a philo-
sophical talk with some great man. He was made
poet laureate when he was seventy-three.

His life closed gently and quietly upon the 23d of
April, 1850, and he was laid in the quiet church-
yard at Grasmere. s T

Then came in all the king’s wise men: but they
could not read the writing, nor make known to the
king the interpretation thereof. ,

Then was King Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his
countenance was changed in him, and his lords were
astonished.

Now the queen, by reason of the words of the king
and his lords, came into the banquet house: and the
queen spake and said: “ 0 king, live for ever: let not
thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be
changed: i

“There is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the
spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father
light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom
of the gods, was found in him; whom the king’ Nebu-
chadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made

him master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans,

and soothsayers ;  
“Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge,

and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing :

of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found
in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar :
now let Daniel be called, and he will show the inter-
pretation.” o _

Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And
the king spake and said unto Daniel: “Art thou that
Daniel, whichart of the children of the captivity of

Judah, whom the king, my father, brought out of

Jewry? ,4

-#835186-

“I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the
gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and
excellent wisdom is found in thee. ,

“ And now the wisemen, the astrologers, have been
brought in before me, that they should read this
writing, and make known unto me the interpretation
thereof: but they could not show the interpretation
of the thing:

“And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make
interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst
read the writing, and make known to me the interpre-
tation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and

’ have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the

third ruler in the kingdom.”

Then Daniel answered and said before the king:
“ Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to
another ; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and
make known to him the interpretation.

“O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchad-
nezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory,
and honor:

“And for the majesty that he gave him, all people,
nations, and languages trembled and feared before him :
whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept
alive; and whom he would he set up, and whom he
would he put down. V

-“But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind
hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly
throne, and they took his glory from him:

10

25

-983523<<-

“And he was driven from the sons of men; and his
heart was made like ‘the beasts, and his dwelling was
with the wild asses : they fed him with grass like oxen,
and his body was wet with the dew of heaven ; till he

5 knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of

men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.
“And thou his son, 0 Belshazzar, hast not humbled
thine heart, though thou knewest all this; ‘
“But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of
10 heaven; and they have brought the Vessels of his
house before thee, and thou and thy lords and’ thy
wives, have drunk wine in them ; and thou hast praised
the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and
stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God
15 in whose hand thy breath is,iand whose are all thy
ways, hast thou not gloriﬁed:

“ Then was the part of the hand sent from him ; and

this writing was written. ‘
“ And this is the writing that was written : —

20 MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.

This is the interpretation of the thing : —

. PERES;

Thy kingdom is DIVIDED,
And given to the Medes and Persians.”

Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel
with scarlet and put a chain of gold about his neck, 5
and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should
be the thirdruler in the kingdom.

In that night Was Belshazzar, the king of the Chal-  

deans, slain.
And Darius, the Median, took the kingdom, being 10

about threescore and two years old.

THE BATTLE OF QUEBEC.
FRANCIS PARKMAN.

FRANCIS PARKMAN was born in Boston in 1823. He was grad-
uated from Harvard College when he was twenty-one. He visited
C Europe and on his return went
on a tour in the far West, across

Mountains. He became well ac-
quainted with the Indians, shar-
ing their camps and hunting
buffaloes with them. His book,
“The California and Oregon
Trail,” contains a vivid account
of his explorations. This book
was followed by “ The History of
the Conspiracy of Pontiac” and
a novel called “ Vassal Morton.”
. Mr. Parkman devoted a num-
ber of years to writing histories of the attempts of the French
and English to settle North America. His qualities as a writer
were of a high order. His style is marked by uncommon vigor.
His pages are alive with thrilling adventure, brilliant description,
and romantic episodes. He has left no room for a competitor in

THE eventful night of the 12th was clear and calm,
with no light but that of the stars. Witihin two hours
before daybreak thirty boats, crowded with sixteen hun~
dred soldiers, cast off from the vessels and ﬂoated down

To the boundless joy of the army, VVolfe’s malady had

abated, and he was able to command in person. His_

ruined health, the gloomy prospects of the siege, and the

disaster at Montmorenci had oppressed him with the

deepest melancholy, but never impaired for a moment

the promptness of his decisions or the impetuous energy

of his action. He sat in the stern of one of the boats,
pale and weak, but borne up to a calm. height of resolu-
tion. Every order had been given, every arrangement
made, and it only remained to face the issue. The ebb-

5

ing tide suﬂiced to bear the boats along, and nothing ,

broke the silence of the night but the gurgling of‘ the
river and the low voice of Wolfe, as he repeated to the

Country Churchyard,” which had recently appeared and

a which he had just received from England. Perhaps, as

he uttered those strangely appropriate words, —
“ The paths of glory lead but to the grave,”

the shadows of his own approaching fate stole with
mournful prophecy across his mind. “Gentlemen,” he

said as he closed his recital, “ I Would rather have writ

ten those lines than take Quebec to-morrow.’,’ i
As they approached the landing-place, the boats edged
closer in towards the northern shore, and the Woody

They reached the landing-place in safety — an indenta- l

tion in the shore about a leagueabove the city, and now
bearing the name of Wolfe’s Cove. Here a narrow path

led up the face of the heights, and a French guard was p

posted at the top to defend the pass. By the force of

the current the foremost boats, including that which

THE STARLING.

‘LAURENCE STERNE.

LAIiRENoE STERNE, an English novelist, was born in Ire-
land in 1713.
He was the son of an English officer, and the ﬁrst ten years of

' his life were spent in traveling about with his father’s regiment.

He then entered a school near Halifax, where. he studied for
eight or nine years, and completed his education at the Univer-
sity of Cambridge.

Mr. Sterne became a clergyman of the Church of England, but
devoted a large portion of his time to the writing of ﬁction.

AND as for the Bastille, the terror is in the word.

said I, correcting the proposition, “the Bastille is not

I was interrupted in the heyday of this soliloquy with
a voice which I took to be that of a child, which com-
I looked up and down the
passage, and, seeing neither man, woman, nor child, I
went out without further attention. K

In my return back through the passage, I heard the
same words repeated twice over ; and, looking up, I saw
it was a starling, hung in a little cage. “I can’t get
out — I can’t get out,” said the starling. A

cost what it will.” So I turned about the cageto get
the door. It was twisted and double twisted so fast
with wire there was no getting it open without pulling
the cage to pieces. I took both hands to it.

“ I can’t get out,” said the star-

“ I fear, poor creature,” said I, “I cannot set thee at

I can’t get out.” i  

I never had my affections more tenderly awakened,
nor do I remember an incident in my life where

the dissipated spirits to which my reason had been a

bubble were so suddenly called home. Mechanical as
the notes were, yet so true in tune to nature were they
chanted, that in one moment they overthrew all my
systematic reasonings upon the Bastille ; and I heavily
walked upstairs, unsaying every word I had said in
going down’ them. .

The bird in his cage pursued me into my room. I
sat down close by my table, and, leaning my head upon
my hand, I began to ﬁgure to myself the miseries of

gave full scope to my imagination. .o 

I was going to begin with the millions of my fellow-

I beheld his body half wasted away with long expec-

of the heart it was which arises from hope deferred.
Upon looking nearer, I saw him pale and feverish. In
thirty years the western breeze had not once fanned his

shook his head, and Went on With his Work of afﬂiction.

to lay his little stick upon the bundle. He gave a deep
sigh. I saw the iron enter into his soul. I burst into

which my fancy had drawn.

ON the cross-beam, under the Old South bell,
The nest of a pigeon is builded Well. '
In summer and Winter that bird is there,
Out and in with the morning air;
I love to see him track the street,
With his wary eye and active feet;
-And I often watch him as he springs,
Circling the steeple with easy wings,
Till across the dial his shadow has passed,

— And the belfry edge is gained at last.
’T is a bird I love, with its brooding note,
And the trembling throb in its mottled throat;
There ’s a human look in its swelling breast,
And the gentle curve of its lowly crest;
And I often stop with the fear I feel -—
He runs so close to the rapid Wheel.

Whatever is r11ng on that noisy bell —-

Chime of the hour, or funeral knell —

  The dove in the belfry must hear it well.

When the tongue swings out to the‘ midnight moon,

_When the sexton cheerily rings for noon,

When the clock strikes clear at morning light,
When the child is waked with “ nine at night,”
When the chimes play soft in the Sabbath air,
Filling the spirit with tones of prayer, -
Whatever tale in the bell is heard,

He broods on his folded feet unstirred,

Or, rising half in his rounded nest,

He takes the time to smooth his breast,

Then drops again, with ﬁlméd eyes,

And sleeps as the last vibration dies.

Sweet bird, I would that I could be

A hermit in the crowd like thee!

eWith wings to ﬂy to Wood and glen,

Thy lot, like mine, is cast with men;
And daily, with unwilling feet,

I tread, like thee, the crowded street;
But unlikeime, when day is o’er,

‘Thou canst dismiss the world and soar,
‘ Or, at a half-felt wish for rest,

Canst smooth the feathers on thy breast,
And drop, forgetful, to thy nest.

LADY UNA AND THE LION.
EDMUND SPENSER.

EDMUND SPENSER was a famous English poet who lived in the
time of Queen Elizabeth. He was born in London in 1553» and

. received his education at Cambridge, where he was a sizar.

There is a mulberry tree which Spenser is said to have planted
still standing inthe garden of the
college.

His early boyhood was passed in
London, with frequent visits among C
the glens of northern England.

Spenser left Cambridge‘ when he
was twenty—four years old, and spent
several years with his relations in the
north of England. On his return it
to London, he published a series of 
twelve poems named after the
months, and called “ The Shep-
hearde’s Calender.” This gained
him a name as the ﬁrst poet of the day. The next summer
he went to Ireland as secretary to Lord Grey.

Several years later he was awarded the Castle of Kilcolman 20
for his services. Here he was visited by Sir VValter Raleigh.
Spenser had written three books of “ The Faerie Queene,” his
greatest poem, and Raleigh listened to them as the two poets sat
beneath the alder trees beside the River Mulla, which ﬂowed
through the castle grounds. Raleigh was delighted with the 25
poem, and persuaded Spenser to accompany him to England,
where he was presented to the Queen.

The ﬁrst three books of “ The Faerie Queene ” were dedicated
to Queen Elizabeth. It was the ﬁrst great allegorical poem that
England had produced, and it has never lost its power. 30

-#836834"

Spenser possessed a wonderful imagination, and had but to I

close his eyes and he was in an enchanted land.
“ The Faerie Queene” is the story of nobleknights ﬁght-
ing against wrong, and a beautiful lady rescued from danger.
5 Only six books of the twelve which Spenser planned were
published. .
The last. years of Spenser’s life were ﬁlled with sadness.
During a rebellion his castle was burnt, and he and his family
’ fled to England.
10 He died in London in 1599, at the age of forty-six, and wa
buried in Westminster Abbey. >

NOUGHT is there under heaven’s wide hallowness
That moves more dear compassion of mind,
Than beauty brought t’ unworthy wretchedness
Through envy’s snares, or fortune’s freaks unkind.
I, whether lately_ through her brightness blind,
Or through allegiance and fast fe'alty,
Which I do owe unto all womankind,
Feel my heart pierced with so great agony,
When such I see, that all for pityl could die.

And now it is empassioned so deep,
For fairest Una’s sake, of whom I sing,

. That my frail eyes these lines with tears do steep,
To think how she through guileful handeling,
Though ‘true as touch, though daughter of a king,
Though fair as ever living wight was fair,

Though nor in word nor deed ill meriting,
It Is from her Knight divorced in despair,
And her due loves derived to that vile Witch’s share. V

-9836984"

Yet she, most faithful Lady all this while,
Forsaken, woeful, solitary maid,

Far from all people’s press, as in exile,

In wilderness and wasteful deserts stray’d
To seek her Knight; who, subtilly betray’»d

Through that late vision Which th’ Enchanter wrought,

~ Had her abandon’d: she, of nought affray’d,
L Through woods and wastenesswide him daily sought ;
Yet wished tidings none of him unto her brought.

One day, nigh weary of the irksome way,
From her unhasty beast she did alight;

And on the grass her dainty limbs did lay -

In secret shadow, far from all men’s sight;
From her fair head her ﬁllet she undight,

And laid her stole aside: her angel’s face,

As the great eye of heaven, shined bright,

And made a sunshine in the shady place:

Did never mortal eye behold such heavenly grace.

It fortuned, out of the thickest wood
A ramping lion rushed suddenly,
Hunting full greedy after savage blood:
Soon as the royal Virgin he did spy,
‘ With gaping mouth at her ran, greedily,
Tohave at once devour’d her tender corse;
But to the prey when as he drew more nigh,
~His bloody rage assuaged with remorse,  
And, with the sight amazed, forgat his furious force.

Comfort have thou of thy merit, i
Kindly, unassuming spirit! ’

‘ Careless of thy neighborhood,

Thou dost show thy pleasant face
On the moor, and in the Wood,

In the lane ;—there ’s not a place,
Howsoever mean it be,

But ’t is good enough for thee.

I11 befall the yellow ﬂowers,
Children of the ﬂaring hours!
Buttercups, that will be seen,
Whether We Will see or no ;_
Others, too, of lofty mien,

They have done as Worldlings do,

' Little, humble celandine 1

Instead thereof, he kiss’d her weary feet,

And lick’d her lily hands with fawning tongue,
As he her wronged innocence did weet.

0, how can beauty master the most strong,

And simple truth subdue avenging wrong!
Whose yielded pride and proud submission,

Still dreading death, when she had marked long,
Her heart ’gan melt in great compassion;

And drizzling tears did shed for pure affectiiin.

“ The lion, lord of every beast in field,”
Quoth she, “his princely puissance doth abate,

" And mighty proud to humble weak does yield,
Forgetful of the hungry rage which late
Him prick’d, in pity of my sad estate :—-
But he, my lion, and my noble lord,
How does he ﬁnd in cruel heart to hate
Her that him loved, and ever most adored

As the god of my life? why hath he me abhorr’d ? ”

Redounding tears did choke th’ end of her plaint,

Which softly echo’d from the neighbor wood;

- And, sad to see her sorrowful constraint,
The kingly beast upon her gazing stood ;
With pity calm’d, down fell his angry mood.
At last, in closeiheart shutting up her pain,
Arose the Virgin born of heavenly brood,  
And to her snowy palfrey got again,

To seek her strayed Champion if she might attain.

~»e3718<+

The lion would not leave her desolate,
But with her went along, as a strong guard
Of her chaste person, and a faithful mate
Of her sad troubles and misfortunes hard :
Still, when she slept, he kept both watch and ward;
And, when she waked, he Waited diligent,
With humble service to her will prepared:
From her fair eyes he took commandement,
And ever by her looks conceived her intent.

From “ The Faerie Queene.”

Una is the heroine of the ﬁrst Book of Spenser’s “ Faerie Queene.”
She appears to have been intended, at least in part, as a poetical impersona-
tion of Truth. At all events, she is one of.the sweetest and loveliest visions
that ever issued from a poet’s brain.

PURITY OF CHARACTER. A

OVER the plum and apricot there may be seen a
bloom and beauty more exquisite than the fruit itself
—a soft delicate ﬂush that overspreads its blushing
cheek. Now, if you strike your hand over that, and it
is once gone, it is gone_ forever; for it never grows but
once.

The ﬂower that hangs in the morning impearled
with dew, arrayed with jewels, once shake it so that
the beads roll off, and you may sprinkle water over it
as you please, yet it can never be made again what it
was when the dew fell lightly upon it from heaven.

On a frosty morning you may see the panes of glass

covered with landscapes, mountains, lakes, and trees,

blended in a beautiful fantastic picture. Now lay
your hand upon the glass, and by the scratch of your

L ﬁngers, or by the warmth of the palm, all thedelicate

20

25

tracery will be immediately obliterated.

So in youth there is a purity of character “which
when once touched and deﬁled can never be restored
——'-a fringe more delicate than frost-work, and which,
when torn and broken, will never be reembroidered.

When a young man leaves his father’s house, with
the blessing of his mother’s tears still wet upon his
forehead, if he once loses that early purity of character,

it is a loss he can never make whole again.

DELIGHTS ‘OF READING.
SIR JOHN LUBBOCK.

BOOKS are to mankind what memory is to the indi-
vidual. They contain the history of our race, the dis-
coveries We have made, the accumulated knowledge and
experience of ages; they picture for us the marvels and
beauties of nature; help us in our difficulties, comfort
us in sorrow and in suffering, change hours of weariness
into moments of delight, store our minds with ideas,

. ﬁll them with good and happy thoughts, and lift us

out of and above ourselves.

There is an Oriental story of two men: one was a
king, who every night dreamt he was a beggar,’ the
other was a beggar, who every night dreamt he was a
prince and lived in a palace. I am not sure that the
king had very much the best of it. Imagination is
sometimes more vivid than reality. But, however this
may be, when we read we may not only (if we wish it)
be kings and live in palaces, but, what is far better, we
may transport ourselves to the mountains or the sea-
shore, and visit the most beautiful parts of the earth,
without fatigue, inconvenience, or expense. V

Many of those who have had, as we say, all that this
world can give, have yet told us they owed much of
their purest "happiness to books. Ascham, in “The
Schoolmaster,” tells a touching story of his last visit

10

15

20

l to Lady Jane Grey. He found her sitting in an oriel 25

->83748<—

window reading Plato’s beautiful account of the death
of Socrates. Her father and mother were hunting in
the park, the hounds were in full cry and their voices
came in through the open window. He expressed his
surprise that she had not joined them. But, said she,
“I Wist that all their pleasure in the park is but a

' shadow to the pleasure I ﬁnd in Plato.”

Macaulay had wealth and fame, rank and power, and

I yet he tells us in his biography that he owed the hap-

10

15

piest hours of his life to books. In a charming letter
to a little girl he says: “ Thank you for your very pretty
letter. I am always glad to make my little girl happy,
and nothing pleases 1ne so much as to see that she likes

books, for when she is as old as I am she will ﬁnd that a

they arebetter than all the tarts and cakes, toys and
plays, and sights in the world. If any one would make

' me the greatest king that ever lived, With palaces and

20

gardens and ﬁne dinners, and wines and coaches, and
beautiful clothes, and hundreds of servants, on condi-
tion that I should not read books, I would not be a
king. I would rather be a poor man in a garret
with plenty of books than a king who did not love

» reading.” ,

25

Books, indeed, endow us with a whole enchanted pal-
ace of thoughts. There is a wider prospect, says Jean
Paul Richter, from Parnassus than from the throne. In
one way they give us an even more vivid idea than the

‘ actual reality, just as reﬂections are often more beauti-

ful than real nature. All mirrors, says George Mac-

-+8 3'75 86-

Donald, “ are magic mirrors. The commonest room is
a room in a poem when I look in the glass.”

English literature is the birthright and inheritance of
the English race. ‘We have produced and are produ-
cing some of the greatest of poets, of philosophers, of
men of science. ~ No race can boast a brighter, purer,
or nobler literature ——richer than our commerce, more
powerful than our arms. It is the true pride and glory
of our country, and for it We cannot be too thankful.

Precious and priceless are the blessings which the
books scatter around our daily paths. We walk, in

. imagination, with the noblest spirits, through the most

sublime and enchanting regions, — regions Which, to all
that is lovely in the forms and colors of earth,
“ Add ‘the gleam,

The light that never was on sea or land,

The consecration and the poet’s dream.”
Without stirring from our ﬁresides We may roam to
the most remote regions of the earth, or soar into
realms Where Spenser’s shapes of unearthly beauty
ﬂock to meet us, Where Milton’s angels peal in our ears
the choral hymns of Paradise. Science, art, literature,

philosophy,—-p—all that manhas thought, all that man

has done, —the experience that has been bought with

15

20

the sufferings of a hundred generations, ——-all are gar- 25

nered up for us in_the world of books.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE was born in the year 1564,
at Stratford-on-Avon, in England. Queen Elizabeth.
was on the throne then, i  c
and it was one of the
most brilliant periods
in all English history. .
The poems and plays
that Shakespeare wrote
are the greatest in the  
English language, and  
one cannot appreciate
the best there is in lit- 
erature unless he has E
studied them. It is
strange that no one
thought, in the time ‘
that he lived, of writing his history, so that we might
know as much about him and his boyhood as we do of
most other great men.

Stratford is in the heart of England, and the stream 20
of Avon Winds through a beautiful country. There
were two famous old castles near by, which had been
peopled by knights in armor, and out of whose great
stone gateways they had ridden to battle. .

We are sure that Shakespeare loved to listen to the 25
tales of these old battles, for in later years he based
several of his great historical plays upon them.

10

15

20

+8378 8%

One of these plays is called “ Richard III.,”/ and part
of the scenes are laid in the old Warwick Castle, near
his home. He tells how the young son of the Duke
of Clarence was kept a prisoner in one of the great
gloomy towers, by the wicked Duke of Gloucester,
who afterward became King Richard III.; and the

-play ends with the Battle of Bosworth Field, where

King Richard is slain,   i

We know that Shakespeare was fond of the woods
and the ﬁelds, for his plays are ﬁlled with charming
descriptions of their beauty. The forest of Arden was

near Stratford, and its streams and woods ﬁlled him

with such delight that when he became a man he made
them forever famous by writing a play called “As
You Like It,” the most beautiful scenes of which are
laid in this forest.

a He liked to imagine that fairies dwelt in the Arden ,
woods, and though he could not see them in their.

frolics, he could picture them in his brain. When he
saw the grass and ﬂowers wet with dew, it pleased him
to think that this had been a task set by the Queen of
the Fairies in the night for her tiny subjects. So in
his play, “  Midsummer Night’s Dream,” he makes a
fairy say: -- '
“Over hill, over dale,
Thorough brush, thorough brier,

’ I do wander everywhere, .
Swifter than the moony sphere;
And I serve the Fairy Queen.”

+8 379 8“
Then the fairy tells its companion it must hasten
away to its task:——

“ I must go seek some dewdrops here
And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.”

Shakespeare must have been in the forest of Arden 5
often in the summer mornings and seen the dewdrops

Who have made a study of the poet’s life accept that
as his birthday. ‘ The house in which he Was born is

DAFFODILS.

WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.

I WANDERED lonely as a cloud

That ﬂoats on high o’er Vales and hills, T

When all at once I saw a crowd,

A host, of golden daﬁodils;
Besidemtihe lake, beneath the trees, .
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky Way,

They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:

Ten thousand saw I at a glance,

Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The Waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling Waves in glee :

A poet could not‘ but be gay,
In such a jocund company:  

I gazed —and gazed—but little thought

What Wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, When on my couch I lie
In Vacant or in pensive ‘mood,

They ﬂash upon that inward eye

Which is the bliss of solit__ude ;
And then my heart with pleasure ﬁlls,
And dances With the daffodils.

John Shakespeare, was a prosperous tradesman. aHe
Was a wool dealer and farmer. When Shakespeare was
four years old his father became high-bailiff, or mayor
of the town. i

The future dramatist was sent to the village school
at about the age of seven. He could already read,
having learned his letters at home from a very queer
primer. It was called the “horn—book,” because it

was made of a single printed leaf, set in a frame of

wood like our slates, and covered with a thin plate
of horn. .

The boy remained at school only about six years.
His father had failed in many enterprises, and it is
probable he needed his son to help him in his work.
Just what Shakespeare learned at school we do not
know, but his writings show some knowledge of Greek
and Latin, for these languages were taught in the
schools at that time.

It is certain that Shakespeare’s education went on
after he left school. That is, he learned something
from everything he saw about him and from all that
he read. Even the trees in the forest and the streams
inithe meadows taught him .lessons about nature.
And this idea he expresses in his own beautiful Way
in the play “ As You Like It,” when he makes the
banished Duke in the forest of Arden say:——

“ And this our life, exempt from public haunt,

Finds ton ues in trees books in the runnin brooks
8 : y 2
Sermons in stones, and good in everything.”

—->83818<"

It is quite probable that John Shakespeare uncon-
sciously decided the career of his son, for it was while

, he was mayor of Stratford that plays were ﬁrst pre-

sented there, and the players must have obtained his
consent in order to give their performances.

We can also learn from his writings what games
Shakespeare was fond of, or, at least, what sports the
boys of his time took delight in. In Shakespeare’s
“ Comedyof Errors” he refers to the game of football,
and in the historical play of “Julius Caesar,” there is
a ﬁne description of a swimming match between Caesar
and Cassius. Cassius tells the story to Brutus of how
Caesar challenged him to leap into the river Tiber,
armed as they were for battle:—-— a

“ Caesar said to me, ‘ Darest thou, Cassius, now
Leap in with me into this angry ﬂood,
And swim to yonder point ?’ Upon the word,
Accoutered as I Was, I plunged in
And bade him follow 3, so, indeed, he did.
The torrent roar’d and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
And stemming it with hearts of controversy.”

Cassius then tells how Caesar’s strength gave out and
he cried for help, and how Cassius brought him safe to
land. '  

Other sports of Shakespeare’s day were archery,

wrestling, hunting, and falconry, where a bird called a

falcon was let loose into the air to pursue its prey.

When Shakespeare was in his nineteenth year he
married Anne Hathaway, and afew years later he set
out to seek his fortune in London.

He had played some small parts on the stage at
Stratford, and it is not surprising that we soon ﬁnd
him among the players in London, ﬁlling such triﬂing

parts as were offered to him, and even, some accounts

say, holding horses at the stage door to help support
himself and his family. V

His leisure time was spent in. study. “ Plutarch’s

Lives” furnished him with material for his plays of
“Julius Caesar,” “Antony and Cleopatra,” and parts,
at least, of others,

He was a great student of the Bible, so much so
that a learned bishop who made a study of his plays
found that Shakespeare in all his writings had in ﬁve
hundred and ﬁfty different places either quoted from
the Scriptures or referred to them.

Shakespeare rose to fame rapidly. He was associ-
ated in the building of a new theater called the Globe,
where his plays were acted before thousands. Then
the Blackfriars Theater was built, and these two houses
divided the honor of producing his plays.

He gathered up the history of England, the gran-
deur of its courts, the beauty of its woods and ﬁelds,
and the deeds of its people, and told of it ‘all in such
masterful dramas that his name leads all other English
writers. A

The last few years of his life were spent at Stratford-

+>8.’-3833*"

on-Avon, where he had become a large land-owner. He‘
died in the year 1616, at the age of ﬁfty-two.

Nearly every great English writer and poet ever
since has referred, in some way or other, to the plays
of Shakespeare. The speeches of our statesmen owe
much of their strength and beauty to the inﬂuence of
his writings. It has been said that “ Shakespeare is like
a great primeval forest, whence timber shall be cut and
used as long as winds blow and leaves are green.”

THE THREE CASKETS.
[ABRIDGED.]
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.

Belmont. A Room in Portia’s House.‘ Three Caskets of
Gold, Silver, and Lead on Table.

Portia, a beautiful and accomplished heiress, is sought in marriage by a large
number of suitors, whose fate is to be determined by the choice they make of one

of three caskets — gold, silver, and base lead.
The following are the comments of three of the suitors——the Prince of

Morocco, the Prince of Arragon, and Bassanio:—
0
Enter Portia, with the Prince of Morocco.
PORTIA.
Now make your choice.

Monocco.

The ﬁrst, of gohi, which this inscription bears, .-

Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire ;

->8384-8<-

The second, silver, which this promise carries, -

Who ehooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.

This third, dull lead, With Warning all as blunt, ——
Who ehooseth me must give and hazard all he hath. -

How shall I know if I do choose the right?

PORTIA.

The one of them contains my picture, Prince:

» If you choose that, then I am yours Withal.

Monooco.

Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
I will survey th’ inscriptions back again.
What says this leaden casket?

Who ehooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.

i Must give, —— for What? for lead? hazard for lead?

This casket threatens: men, that hazard all
Do it in hope of fair advantages.

A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross ;
I ’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
What says the silver, with her virgin hue?

Who ehooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.

I As much as he deserves! —- Pause there, Morocco,

And Weigh thy value with an even hand:
If thou bie’st rated by thy estimation,

. Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough

May not extend so far as to the lady:

_ Then I am yours.

->83858<-

And yet to be afeard of my deserving,

Were but a Weak disabling of myself.

As much as I deserve! Why, that ’s the lady:
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,

In graces, and in qualities of breeding;

But, more than these, in love I do deserve.
What if I stray’d no further, but chose here?
Let ’s see once more this saying graved in gold:

Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.

Why, that ’s the lady; all the World desires her:
. . . . Deliver me the key;
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!

PORTIA.

There take it Prince and if II1 form lie there
7 7 7 y 7
[He unlocks the golden casket.

Monocco.

What have We here?
A carrion Death, Within Whose empty eye
There is a Written scroll! I ’ll read the Writing.
[Reads] All that glisters is not gold, —
_0ften have you heard that told .'
Many a man his life hath sold,
But my outside to behold .°
Gilded, tombs do worms infold.
Had you been as wise as ‘bold,
Young  limbs, in judgment old,
Y our answer had not been inscroll’d :
Fare you well; your suit is cold.

v'>8386‘3*‘—

Cold, indeed ; and labor lost; A

Then, farewell, heat, and Welcome, frost I-
Portia, adieu I I have too grieved a heart
To take a tedious leave : thus losers part.

[Exit with train.

Enter Prince of A7-wagon.

PORTIA.
Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince;
If you choose that wherein I am contain’d,
Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:

I But if you fail, Without more speech, my lord,

You must be gone from hence immediately.
ARRAGON. I

I am enjoin’d by oath to observe three things :
First,never to unfold to any one I

Which casket ’t was I chose ; next, if I fail

Of the right casket, never in my life

‘To WOO a maid in Way of marriage ; lastly,

If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
Immediately to leave you, and be gone.
PORTIA.
To these injunctions everyone doth swear
That comes to hazard for my Worthless self.
ARRAGON.
And so have ‘I address’d me. Fortune now
To my heart’s hope !——Gold, silver, and base lead.
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.

-->8 387 3*‘

You shall look fairer, ere I give, or hazard.
What says the golden chest? ha! let me see :

Who elzooseth me shall gain what many men desire.

What many men desire ! —That many may be meant
By the fool multitude, that choose by show,

7 Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;

Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,
Builds in the Weather on the outward Wall, "
Even in the force and road of casualty.

I will not choose What many men desire,

Because I Will not jump with common spirits,

And rank me with the barbarous multitude.

Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;

Tell me once more What title thou dost bear:

W/2,0 elzooset/L me shall get as much as he deserves.

‘And Well said too : for Who shall go about p

To cozen fortune, and be honorable

Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
To Wear an undeserved dignity. A

O, that estates, degrees, and offices

Were not derived corruptly! and that clear honor
Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!

How many then should cover, that stand bare!
How many be commanded, that command!

How much. low peasantry would then be g1ean’d
From the true seed of honor! and how much honor

Q Pick’d from the chaff and ruin of the times,

To be new-varnish’d! Well, but to my choice :

->83883<-

Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.

I will assume desert. — Give me a key,
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.

[He opens the silver casket.

PORTIA.

Too long a pause for that which you ﬁnd there.

ARRAGON.

What ’s here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,
Presenting me a schedule! I will read it. —
How much unlike art thou to Portia!

How much unlike my hopes, and my deservingsl

Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.

Did I deserve no more than a fool’s head?
Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?

PORTIA.

T’ offend, and judge, are distinct ofﬁces,
And of opposed natures.

ARRAGON.

. What is here ‘.9

The fire seven times tried this
Seven times tried that judgment is
That did never choose amiss.
Some there he, that shadows hiss ,-

‘ Such have but a shadow’s bliss .-

Still more fool I shall appear

By the time I linger here:

With one fool’s head I came to woo,
But I go away with two. —

Sweet, adieu! I ’ll keep my oath,
Patiently to bear my wroth.

[Exezmt Armgon and Train.

Enter Bassanio.

BAssAN1o.

So may the outward shows be least themselves :
The world, is still deceived with ornament.p.,,,,7ip
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,

But, being season’d with a gracious voice,

Obscures the show of evil?

There is no vice so simple, but assumes

Some mark of virtue on its outward parts:

How many cowards, whose hearts areall as false
As stayers of sand, wear yet upon their chins
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars ;
Who, inward search’d, have livers white as milk! W
And these assume but valor’s excrement,

To render them redoubted. Look on beauty,
And you shall see ’t is purchased by the weight ;
Which therein works a miracle in nature,
Making them lightest that wear most of it:

So are those crisped snaky golden locks,

WALDEN POND.
HENRY DAVID THOREAU.

HENRY DAVID THOREAU was born in Concord, Mass, on the
12th_ of July, 1817. His father was of French descent, and his
mother was the daughter of a New England clergyman.

Henry’s life as a country boy, driving the cow to pasture and

‘ roaming about the woods, made him familiar with Nature; new

discoveries of her beauties and the constant changes of the seasons

soon became his greatest delight. i
The meadows and stream sides were stored with treasures, and

when only twelve years of age he had already made a number of _

collections for Professor Agassiz, the great naturalist. Ralph

Waldo Emerson says of him: ——

“ It seemed as if the breezes brought him,
It seemed as if the sparrow taught him,
As if by secret signs he knew

. Where in far ﬁelds the orchis grew.”

Thoreau attended Harvard College, and was graduated in 1837.
He then joined his brother in teaching a private school; but
soon turned aside from this profession and decided to devote
himself to the study of nature.

He was never idle, but preferred to earn what money he re-
quired by building a fence or a boat, or by laboring on some farm,
rather than to be conﬁned to any regular occupation. He, how-
ever, became a land surveyor, as this employment led him con-
stantly to new ground for observation.

A Robinson Crusoe’s life, with only his -own efforts and na-
ture to depend upon, would have suited this child of nature.
Still, although so hermit like, he was really fond of sympathy,
delighted to entertain his friends with stories of ﬁeld and river,
and was always ready to lead a party in search for nuts or

, berries. ~

To be the dowry of a second head,

To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf

T Veiling an Indian feature ; in a Word,

Hard food for Midas, I Will none of thee :

[Opening the leaden casket.

What ﬁnd I here?

Fair Portia’s counterfeit!

Here ’s the scroll,
The continent and summary of my fortune: —

You that choose not bythe view
Chance as fair, and choose as true:
Since this fortune falls to you,

And hold your fortune for your bliss,
Turn you where your lady is,

PORTIA.

You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,

Such as I am: though, for myself alone,

I would not be ambitious in my wish,

To wish myself much better; yet, for you,

I would be trebled twenty times myself;

A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;
That, only to stand high on your account,

I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,

Exceed account: but the full sum of me

Is sum of — something; which, to term in gross,

‘ Is an unlesson’d girl, unschool’d, unpracticed:

Happy in this, she is not yet so old

But she may learn ; then happier in this,

She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
Happiest of all, in that her gentle spirit
Commits itself to yours to be directed,

As from her lord, her governor, her king.

Myself and what is mine to you and yours

Is now converted: but now I was the lord

Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
Queen o’er myself ; and even now, but now,
This house, these servants, and this same myself,
Are yours, my lord; I give them with this ring;

, Which when you part from, lose, or give away,

Let it presagethe ‘ruin of your love,
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.

From “ The Merchant of Venice.”

QUOTATIONS FROM SHAKESPEARE.
H ADVERSITY.

SWEET are the uses of adversity;
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,

, Wears yet a precious jewel in his head:

And this our life, exempt from public l1aunt,
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones, and good in everything.

“As You Like It.”

REPUTATION.

Goonname in man and Woman, dear my lord,

Is the immediateijewel of their souls:

Who steals my purse steals trash ; ’t is something,
nothing;

’T Was mine, ’t is his, and has been slave to thousands;

But he that ﬁlches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him,

And makes me poor indeed.
“Othello.”

FEAR OF DEATH.
COWARDS die many times before their death; .
The valiant never taste of death but once.

Of all the Wonders that I yet have heard,
It seems to me most‘ strange that men should fear;

. Seeing thatdeath, a necessary end,

Will come when it will come.
“Julius Caesar.”

SHAKESPEARE’S POETRY.  

FRANCIS JEFFREY.

FRANCIS JEFFREY was born in Edinburgh in 1773 and died in
1850. He attended the schools of his native city and completed
his education in the Universities of Glasgow and Oxford, prepar-

ing himself for the pursuit of law.

He was also a writer of essays and criticisms and attained
high rank as a judge and writer. He was at one time editor of
the famous “ Edinburgh Review.”  

SHAKESPEARE alone, when the object requires it,
is always keen and worldly and practical; and yet,
without changing his hand or stopping his course,
scatters around him, as he goes, all sounds and shapes
of sweetness, and conjures up landscapes of immortal
fragrance and freshness, and peoples them with Spir-
its of glorious aspect and attractive grace.
thousand times more full of fancy and imagery and
splendor than those who, in pursuit of such enchant-
ments, have shrunk back from the delineation of char-
acter or passion, and declined the discussion of human
duties and cares. H p

‘More full of wisdom and ridicule and sagacity than
all the moralists and satirists that ever existed, he is
also more wild, airy, and inventive, and mo_re pathetic
and fantastic, than all the poets of all regions and ages
of the world, And he has all those elements so happily

lmixed up in him, and bears his high faculties so tem-
perately, that the most severe reader cannot complain

sensitive for defect of ornament or ingenuity. Every- ’

thing in him is in unmeasured abundance and unequaled
perfection; but everything is so balanced and kept in
subordination, as not to jostle or disturb or take the
place of another. '

The most exquisite poetical conceptions, images, and
descriptions are given with such brevity, and introduced
with such -skill, as merely to adorn, without loading,
the sense they accompany. iAlthough his sails are
purple and perfumed, and his prow of beaten gold,

they waft him on his voyage, not less, but more rapidly

and directly than if they had been composedof baser
materials. All his excellences, like those of Nature

herself, are thrown out together; and, instead of’ inter-

_fering With, support and recommend each other. His
ﬂowers are not tied up in garlands, nor his fruits
crushed into baskets; but spring living from the soil,
in all the dew and freshnessof youth; while the grace-
ful foliage in Which they lurk, and the ample branches,
the rough and vigorous stem, and the Wide-spreading
roots on Which they depend, are present along with
them, and share, in their places, the equal care of their
creator. l

HENRY W. GRADY.

HENRY W. GRADY was born in Georgia in 1851. While a
student at the University of Georgia, he excelled in debate. On
graduation, he determined to makejournalism his life-work. As
the editor of the “Atlanta Constitution,” he rapidly grew into
prominence as a journalist and an orator. Mr. Grady died
in 1889.

A FEW days later I Visited a country home. A
modest, quiet house sheltered by great trees and set in
a circle of ﬁeld and meadow, gracious with the promise
of harvest; barns and cribs well ﬁlled and the old
smoke-house odorous with treasure’; the fragrance of
pink and hollyhock mingling with the aroma of garden

and orchard and resonant with the hum of bees and '

poultry’s busy clucking; inside the house, thrift, com-
fort, and that cleanliness that is next to godliness——the
restful beds, the open ﬁreplace, the books and papers,
and the old clock that had held its steadfast pace amid

the frolic of weddings, that had Welcomed in steady

measure the newborn babes of the family, and kept
company with the watchers of the sick bed, and had

ticked the solemn requiem of the dead; and the well-

Outside stood the master, strong and wholesome and

upright ; wearing no man’s collar 5 with no mortgage on
his roof and no lien on his ripening harvest; pitching
his crops in his own wisdom and selling them in his
own time in his chosen market; master of his lands
and master of himself. Near by stood his aged father,
happy in the heart and home of his son. And as they
started to the house, the old man’s hands rested on

the young man’s shoulder, touching it with theknight-

hood of the ﬁfth commandment and laying there
the unspeakable blessing of an honored and grateful
father. ‘

As they drew near the door, the old mother appeared,
the sunset falling on her face, softening its wrinkles
and its tenderness, lighting up her patient eyes, and
the rich music of her heart trembling on her lips, as
in simple phrase she welcomed her husband and son
to their home. Beyond was the good wife, true of

touch and tender, happy amid her household cares, ,

clean of heart and conscience, the helpmate and the
buckler of her husband. And the children, strong and
sturdy, trooping down the lane with the lowing herd,

the quiet of the old home nest.

And I saw the night descend on that home, falling
gently as from the wings of the unseen dove. And the

DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.

DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON Was born at Lichﬁeld, England, in
1709, and died in 1784. ‘

He -was educated at Oxford, where he gained honor as a
student in spite of his poverty and defective eyesight.

After leaving college Johnson held a position as an usher,
and later was employed by some booksellers.

He gradually began a literary life, publishing some poems, .

and then conducted “The Rambler ” and “ The Idler,” two
periodicals. ,

He Wrote the story of “Rasselas” to pay the expenses of

Dr. J ohnson’s character was a strange union of strength and
weakness. His manners were uncouth, but his conversation Was
rich in Wit and wisdom. His genius was recognized during the
latter years of his life.

and pursue With eagerness the phantoms of hope; who
expect that age Will perform the promises of youth, and
that the deﬁciencies of the present day will be’ supplied

Prince of Abyssinia.
Rasselas was the fourth son of the mighty emperor

in Whose dominidns the Father of Waters begins his

course; Whose bounty pours down the streams of plenty
and scatters over half the world the harvests of Egypt.

qthroﬂuﬂgh his hands.

In 1845 he made an experiment to prove that man could live
as independent of his kind as the birds and squirrels. ‘ Upon a
pine slope on the shoresof Walden Pond he built and furnished
a small house. During two years he lived here studying,‘ writ-
ing, and learning to know the ﬁshes, birds, and other woodland
creatures.

Birds came at his call, and event the ﬁshes swam fearlessly
He would sit immovable, until the bird,
reptile, or ﬁsh which had been startled by his presence would
return, sometimes out of curiosity to observe him, or to resume
its habits.  

/While a young man, he became acquainted with Ralph Waldo
Emerson, who was his lifelong friend. Thoreau so loved nature
that his books are ﬁlled with descriptions of beautiful scenery,
ever-changing wild ﬂowers, and the habits of animals. ~ He was
so happy in solitude that it made him heavy-hearted to see houses
springing up among the woods and meadows where he had wan-
dered as a boy. The axe was always destroying his forest.
“ Thank God,” he said, “they cannot cut down the clouds!”

Thoreau died on the 6th of May, 1862. His grave is in the
beautiful cemetery of Sleepy Hollow, Concord, beside those of
Hawthorne and Emerson. '

IN such a day, in September or October, Walden is a

perfect forest mirror, set round with stones as precious

to my eye as if fewer or rarer. Nothing so fair, so
pure, and at the same timed so large as alake, per-
chance, lies on the surface of the earth. It needs no
fence. Nations come and go without deﬁling it.

It is a mirror which no stone can crack, whose
quicksilver will never wear off, whose gilding Nature
continually repairs; no storms, i no dust, can dim its

surface ever fresh; a mirror in which all impurity pre- .
sented to it sinks, swept and dusted by the sun’s hazy ._ ~

Rasselas was conﬁned in a private palace, with the
other sons and daughters of Abyssinian royalty, till
the order‘ of succession should call him to the throne.

The place which the wisdom or policy of antiquity
had destined for the residence of the Abyssinian princes
was a spacious valley in the kingdom of Amhara, sur-
rounded on every side by mountains, of Which the
summits overhang the middle part. The only passage

by which it could be entered was a cavern that passed  

under a rock. The outlet of the cavern was concealed
by a thick wood, and the mouth which opened into the
valley was closed with gates of iron.

From the mountains on every side rivulets descended
that ﬁlled all the valley with verdure and fertility, and
formed a lake in the middle inhabited by ﬁsh of every
species, and frequented by every fowl whom Nature
has taught to dip the wing in water.
charged its superﬂuities by a stream which entered a
dark cleft of the mountain on the northern side, and
fell with dreadful noise from precipice to precipice till
it was heard no more. i T A

The sides of the mountains were covered with trees,
the banks of the brooks were diversiﬁed with ﬂowers;
every blast shook spices from the rocks, and every
month dropped fruits upon the ground, All animals
that bite the grass, or browse the shrub, whether wild
or tame, wandered in this extensive circuit, secured

the pastures; on another, all beasts of chase frisking
in the lawns. All the diversities of the world were

brought together, the blessings of nature were collected,‘

and its evils extracted and excluded.

The valley, wide and fruitful, supplied its inhabitants
with the necessaries of life, and all delights and super-
ﬂuities were added at the annual visit which the emperor
paid his children, when the iron gate was opened to the
sound of music; and during eight days every one that
resided in the valley was required to propose whatever

. might contribute to make seclusion pleasant, to ﬁll up

of time. Every desire was immediately granted. All

the artiﬁcers of pleasure were called to gladden the
festivity; the musicians exerted the power of harmony,
and the dancers showed their activity before the princes,
in hope that they should pass their lives in this blissful
captivity, to which those only were admitted whose
performance was thought ‘able to add novelty to luxury.
Such was the appearance of security and delight which
this retirement afforded, that theyto whom it wasnew
always desired that it might be perpetual; and as those

suffered to return, the effect of long experience __could
not be known. Thus every year produced new schemes
of delight and new competitors for iprisonment.

The palace stood on an eminence raisedabout thirty
paces above the surface of the lake. It was divided
into many squares or courts, built with greater or less

magniﬁcence, according to the rank of those for whom
they were designed. The roofs were turned into arches

of massy stone, joined by a cement that grew harder by  

time, and the building stood from century to century
deriding the rains and equinoctial hurricanes, without
need of reparation.  
This house, which was so large as to be fully known
to none but some ancient ofﬁcers who successively in-
herited the secrets of the place, was built as if suspicion
herself had dictated the plan. To every room there

was an open and secret passage; every square had a-

communication with the rest, either from the upper
stories by private galleries, or by subterranean passages
from the lower apartments. Many of the columns had
unsuspected cavities, in which a long race of monarchs
had. deposited their treasures. They then closed up

' the opening with marble, which was never to be re-

moved but in the utmost exigencies of the kingdom; ’

and recorded their accumulations in a book which was
itself concealed in a tower not entered but by the
empelkor, attended by the prince who stood next in
succession.

Here the sons and daughters of Abyssinia lived only
to know the soft vicissitudes of pleasure and repose,

attended by all that were skilful to delight, and.

gratiﬁed with whatever the senses can enjoy. They
wandered in gardens of fragrance and slept in the
fortresses of security. Every art was practiced to
make them pleased with their own condition. The

->84-038*‘

sages who instructed them told them of nothing but

the miseriesof public life, and described all beyond  

the mountains as regions of ' calamity, where discord

‘ was always raging, andwhere man preyed upon man.

To heighten their opinion of their own felicity, they

Were daily entertained with songs, the subject of which

was the happy valley. Their appetites were excited
by frequent enumerations of different enjoyments, and
revelry and merriment was the business of every hour
from the dawn of morning to the close of even.

These methods were generally successful ;' few of the

princes had ever wished to enlarge their bounds, but

passed their lives in full conviction that theyhad all
within their reach that art or nature could bestow, and
pitied those whom fate had excluded from this seat of
tranquillity.

. Thus they rose in the morning and lay down at

night, pleased with each other and with themselves,———
all but Rasselas, Who, in the twenty-sixth year of his
age, began to withdraw himself from their pastimes
and assemblies, and to delight in solitary walks and
silent meditation. He often sat before tables covered

’ with‘ luxury, and forgot to taste the dainties that were

placed before him; he rose abruptly in the midst of
the song and hastily retired beyond the sound of music.
His attendants observed the change and endeavored to
renew his love of pleasure. He neglected their ofﬁcious-
ness, repulsed their invitations, and spent day after day

onjthe banks of rivulets sheltered with trees, where _ p

he sometimes listened to the birds in the branches,
sometimes observed the ﬁsh playing in the stream, and
anon cast his eyes upon the pastures" and mountains
ﬁlled with animals.

This singularity of his humor made him much ob-

served. One of the sages, in whose conversation he

' had formerly delighted, followed him secretly, in hope

of discovering the cause of his disquiet. Rasselas, who
knew not that any one was near him, having for some
time ﬁxed his eyes upon the goats that were browsing
among the rocks, began to compare their condition
with his own. a

“What,” said he, “makes the difference between
man and all the rest of the animal creation? Every
beast that strays beside a me has the same ’b‘odily
necessities with myself; he is hungry and crops the

grass, he is thirsty and drinks the stream; his thirst '

and hunger are appeased, he is satisﬁed and sleeps; he
rises again and is hungry; he is again fed and is at

rest. I am hungry and thirsty, like him; but when  

thirst and hungercease, I am not at rest; I am, like
him, pained with want; but am not, like him, satisﬁed
with fullness. I The intermediatehours are tedious and
gloomy; I long again to be hungry, that I may again
quicken my attention. The birds peck the berries or
the corn, and ﬂy away to the groves, where they sit
in seeming happiness on the branches and wastetheir

that pleased me yesterday Weary me to-day, and Will
grow more Wearisome to—morroW. I can discover
within me no power of perception which is not glutted
with its proper pleasure, yet I do not feel myself de-
lighted. Man surely has some latent sense for Which
this place aﬁords no gratiﬁcation, or he has some desires
distinct from sense, which must be satisﬁed before he
can be happy.” .  

After this he lifted up his head, and, seeing the moon
rising, Walked toward the palace. As he passed through
the ﬁelds and saw the animals around him, “ Ye,” said

. he, “ are happy, and need not envy me that Walk thus

among you, burdened With myself; nor do I, ye gentle
beings, envy your felicity, for it is not the felicity of
man. I have many distresses from Which ye are free;
I fear pain when I do not feel it; surely the equity
of Providence has balanced peculiar sufferings With
peculiar enjoyments.” I

With observations like these the prince amused him-
self as he returned, uttering them with a plaintive
voice, yet with a look that discovered him to feel some
complacence in his own perspicacity, and to receive
some solace of the miseries of life from consciousness

of the delicacy with which he bevvailed them. He  

mingled cheerfully in the diversions of the evening,
and all rejoiced to ﬁnd that his heart was lightened. ,

TRUE HEROISM.

LET others write of battles fought,

. Of bloody, ghastly ﬁelds,

Where honor greets the man Who Wins,
And death the man Who yields;

But I Will Write of him Who ﬁghts
And Vanquishes his sins,

Who struggles on through Weary years i

Against himself, and Wins.

He is a hero stanch and brave
Who ﬁghts an unseen foe,

And puts at last beneath his feet
His passions base and low;

«Who stands erect in manhood’s might,

Undaunted, undismayed, -

The bravest man who drew a sword
In foray or in raid.

It calls for something more than brawn
Or muscle to o’ercome

An enemy Who marcheth not
With banner, plume, or drum, -

A foe forever lurking nigh,
With silent, stealthy tread;

Forever near your board by day,
At night beside your bed.

->84-07 86-

All honor, then, to that brave heart,
Though poor or rich he be, .

Who struggles with his baser part, —
Who conquers and is free!

He may not Wear a hero’s crown,  
Or ﬁll a hero’s grave;

But truth will place his name among
The bravest of the brave. ,

MOUNT VERNON, THE HOME OF WASHINGTON.

CHARACTER OF'- WASHINGTON.

GEORGE BANCROFT.

GEORGE BANCROFT was born at Worcester, Mass, in<1800 and

died in 1891. O

T He Was graduated from Harvard College when he was seven-
teen,loearing off the second honors of his class.

The following year he sailed for Europe and spent ﬁve years
studying under the most learned professors in Germany, France,
and Italy.

On his return to America he became a tutor at Harvard and
was afterwards connected with a classical school at Northampton.

He Was deeply interested in the affairs of the nation, but
refused to enter public life, as he had decided to Write a history
of the United States.  

The first Volume of this history appeared in 1834, and the
series occupied his time for many years.

+8 409 s<~

Mr. Bancroft held the position of secretary of the navy for
about a year underPresident Polk. It was due to his efforts
that the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., was established.

He was appointed minister to England in 1846 and remained
abroad for three years. 7 .

' He returned to this country and resumed his literary.,_work.
In 1867 he was appointed minister to Berlin by Presidentsfﬁlrant.
. The “History of the United States” is without a rival. It
is generally accepted as an authority. Mr. Bancroft spared no
pains in his researches among old manuscripts, and his style
is full of interest. A A

AT eleven years old, left, an orphan, to the care of an
excellent but unlettered motlier, Washington grew up
without learning. Of arithmetic and geometry he ac-
quired just knowledge enough to be able to practice
measuring land ; but all his instruction at school taught

15

him not so much as the orthography or rules of grammar A

of his own tongue. His culture was altogether his own

work, and he was in the strictest sense a self-made man ;

yet from his early lifehe never seemed uneducated. At
sixteen he went into the wilderness as surveyor, and

for three years continued the pursuit, where the forest

trained him, in meditative solitude, to freedom and
largeness of mind; and Nature revealed to him her
obedience to serene and silent laws.  

In his intervals from toil, he seemed always to be
attracted to the best men, and to be cherished by them.

self to with care; and his papers, which have been

preserved, show how he almost imperceptibly gained

the power of ‘writing correctly ; always expressing him-
self with clearness and directness, often with felicity of
language and grace. e ~

Courage was so natural to him that it was hardly

spoken of to his praise; no one ever at any moment.

of his life discovered in him the least shrinking from

danger; and he had a liardihood of daring which

escaped notice, because it was so enveloped by superior
calmness and wisdom. , '

He was as cheerful as he was spirited; frank and
communicative in the society of friends; fond of the
fox-chase and the dance; often sportive in his letters;
and liked a hearty laugh. This joyousness of disposi-
tion remained to the last, though the vastness of his
responsibilities was soon to take from him the right of
displaying the impulsive qualities of his nature, and the
weight which he was to bear up was to overlay and
repress his gayety and openness. .

His hand was liberal ;. giving quietly and without
observation, as though. he were ashamed of nothing but
being discovered in doing good. He was kindly and
compassionate, and of lively sensibility to the sorrows

of others; so that, if his country had only needed a A o

victim for its relief, he would have willingly offered
himself as a sacriﬁce. But while he was prodigal of
himself, he was considerate for others ; ever parsimonious
of the blood of his countrymen.

+>a4118<~

His faculties were so well balanced and combined
that his constitution, free from excess, was tempered
evenly with all the elements of activity, and his mind
resembled a well-ordered commonwealth; his passions,
which had the intensest vigor, ’ owned allegiance ..to
reason; and with all the ﬁery quickness of his spirit
his impetuous and massive will Was held in check by
consummate judgment. He had in his composition a
calm which gave him, in moments of highest excite-

ment, the power of self-control,and enabled him to »

excel in patience, even when he had most cause for
disgust. Washington was offered a command when
there was little to bring out the unorganized resources
of the continent but his own inﬂuence, and authority

was connected with the people by the most frail,’ most

attenuated, scarcely discernible threads; yet, vehement
as was his nature, impassioned as was his courage, he
so restrained his arldor, that he never failed contin-
uously to exert the attracting power of that inﬂuence,
and never exerted it so sharply as to break its force.
His understanding was lucid, and his judgment accu-
rate; so that his conduct never betrayed hurry or
confusion. No detail was too minute for his personal
inquiry and continued supervision; and at the same
time he comprehended events in their widest aspects and
relations. He never seemed above the object that en-
gaged his attention; and he was always equal, without

an effort, to the solution of the highest questions, even .
when there existed no precedents‘ to guide his decision. L

In this way he never drew to himself admiration for
the possession of any one quality in excess; never
made in council any one suggestion that was sublime
but impracticable ; never in action took to himself the
praise or the blame of undertakings astonishing in con-
ception, but beyond his means of execution.

placed upon the largest theater of events, at the-head

of the greatest revolution in human affairs, he never

failed to observe all that Was possible, and at the
sa1ne time to bound his aspirations by that which was
possible. i p
Profoundly impressed With conﬁdence in God’s provi-
dence, and exemplary in his respect for the forms
of public Worship, no philosopher of the eighteenth
century Was more ﬁrm in the support of freedom of
religious opinion; none more tolerant, or more remote
from bigotry; but belief in God and trust in His over-
ruling power formed the essence of his character.
Divine Wisdom not only illumines the spirit, it inspires
the Will. Washington was a man of action, and not of
theory or Words; his creed appears in his life, not in
his professions, which burst from him very rarely, and
only at those great moments of crisis in the fortunes of
his country, When Earth and Heaven seemed actually
to meet, and his emotions became too intense for sup-
pression; but his whole being was one continued act
of faith in the eternal, intelligent, moral order of the
Universe.

his nature, that a planet would sooner have shot from
its sphere, than he have departed from his uprightness,
which was so constant that it- often seemed to be
almost impersonal, a
They say of Giotto, that he introduced goodness into
the art of painting: Washington carried it with him
to the camp and the cabinet, and established a new
criterion of human greatness. The purity of hisiwill

conﬁrmed his fortitude; and, as he never faltered in

his faith in virtue, he stood fast by that which he knew
to be just; free from “illusions; never dejected by the
apprehension of the difficulties and perils that went
before him; and drawing the promise of success from
the justice of his cause. Hence he was persevering,
leaving nothing unﬁnished; free from all taint of
obstinacy in his ﬁrmness; seeking and gladly receiving
advice, but immovable in his devotedness to right.

Of a “retiring modesty and habitual reserve,” his
ambition was no more than the consciousness of his
power, and was subordinate to his sense of duty; he
took the foremost place, for he knew, from inborn
magnanimity, that it belonged to him, and he dared
not withholdthe service required of him; so that, with
all his humility, he was by necessity theﬁrst,” though
never for himself or for private ends. He loved fame,
the approval of coming generations, the good opinion
of his fellow-men of his own time; and he desired to

‘make his conduct coincide with their wishes; but not

fear of censure, not the prospect of applause, could

tempt him to swerve from rectitude; and the praise
which he coveted was the sympathy of that moral
sentiment which exists in every human breast, and goes
forth only to the Welcome of virtue.

This also is the praise of Washington, that never in
the tide of time has any man lived who had in so great
a degree the almost divine faculty to command the con-
ﬁdence of his fellow-men and rule the Willing. Where-
ever he became known, in his family, his neighborhood,
his county, his native state, the continent, the camp,
civil life, the United States, among the common people,
in foreign courts, throughout the civilized World of the
human race, and even among the savages, he, beyond
all other men, had the conﬁdence oflhis kind.



NATIONAL HYMN.
SAMUEL FRANCIS SMITH.

SAMUEL FRANCIS SMITH was born in Boston in 1808, and died
in 1895. S

He attended the Boston Latin School, was graduated at Har-
vard College, and then studied for the ministry at the Andover
Theological Seminary. While in Harvard he Was a classmate of
Oliver Wendell Holmes.
years after they had left college, Holmes read a poem which he
had written for the occasion, called “ The Boys,” and spoke of
Mr. Smith in these words : «

“ He chanted a song for the brave and the free,
Just read on his medal, ‘ My Country, of thee.’ ”

He referred to the poem beginning “ My country, ’t is of thee,”
the national hymn of America, Written by Mr. Smith when he
was a young theological student, and ﬁrst sung at a children’s
celebration, held on one Fourth‘ of July, in the Park Street
Church, Boston. .

A collection of his hymns and poems has been published under
the title of “ Lyric Gems.”

smooth, betrayed where a spring welled up from the
bottom. a e

Paddling gently to one of these places, I was sur-
prised to ﬁnd myself surrounded by myriads of small

perch, about ﬁve inches long, of a rich bronze color in _

the green water, sporting there and constantly rising

to the surface and dimpling it, sometimes leaving bub-

bles on it. In such transparent and seemingly bottom-
less water, reﬂecting the clouds, I seemed to be ﬂoating
through the air as in a balloon, and their swimming
impressed me as a kind of ﬂight or hovering, as if they
were a compact ﬂock of birds passing just beneath -my
level on the right or left, their ﬁns, like sails, set all
around them. A

There weremany such schools in the pond, appar-
ently improving the short season before winter would
draw an icy shutter over their broad skylight, some-
times giving to the surface an appearance as if a slight
breeze struck it, or a few raindrops fell there. When
I approached carelessly andalarmed them, they made
a sudden splash and rippling with their tails, as if one
had struck the water with a brushy bough, and instantly
took refuge in the depths.  
\S"Even as late as the 5th of December, one year, I
saw some dimples on the surface, and thinking it was
going, to rain hard immediately, the air being full of

mist, I made haste to take my place at the oars. and

pated a thorough soaking. But suddenly the dimples
ceased, for they were produced by the perch, which the p
noise of my oars had scared into the depths, and I saw

their schools rapidly disappearing; so I spent a dry

afternoon after all.     5
An old man who. used to frequent this pond nearly
sixty years ago, when it was dark with surrounding
forests, tells me that in those days he sometimes saw it
all alive with ducks and other waterfowl, and that there/’
were many eagles about it. He came here a-ﬁsh.ing 10
and used an old log canoe which he found on the shore.
It was made of two white-pine logs dug out and pinned

. together, and was cut off square at the ends.

It was vvery clumsy, but lasted a great many years

before it became water—logged and sank to the bottom. 15

Hedid not know whose it was ; it belonged to the pond.

‘ He used to make a cable for his anchor, of strips of
hickory bark tied together. An old man, a potter,‘
who lived by the pond before the Rev3li1_tio11, told him
once that there was an ironchest at the bottom, and 20
that he had seen it. Sometimes it would tcome ﬂoat-
ing up to the shore; but when you went toward it, it
would go back into deep water and disappear.

I was pleased to hear of the old log canoe, which
took the place of an Indian one of the same material 25
but more graceful construction, which perchanceihad
ﬁrst been a tree on the bank, and then, as it were, fell
into the water, to ﬂoat there for a generation, the most
proper Vessel for the lake.

THE PUPPET SHOW.
JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE.

J OHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, one of the greatest Writers
that Germany has ever produced, was born at Frankfort on the
I Main, August 28, 1749. V

Goethe attended no school during his early years, but his
5 surroundings were an education, and his father and mother en-
couraged him in reading and studying the books with which their

home Was ﬁlled. , F
During the Seven Years’ War there were many French soldiers

at Frankfort, and they greatly inﬂuenced the boy. From them

‘ he learned passages from plays, and

French language.

When he Was sixteen, Goethe en-
tered the university at Leipsic. His
father sent him there to study law,
but he had already decided to de-
vote himself to literature. He also
became interested in art and studied
drawing, for Which he had consider-
able talent. He remained there
three years and then Went to Stras-
burg, entering the university.

At this time he made the acquaint-

ance of a noted German scholar and thinker, who,taught him the

25 true value of "nature in art, and revealed to him the beauty of
classic and English literature. - .

Goethe returned to Frankfort on his twenty-second birthday.

His sister Cornelia. sympathized with him in all his hopes and

aspirations, but he had outgrown many of the friends of his boy-
3o hood. He spent his time in writing, and produced a number of

soon became Well versed in the

poems and several essays; but one of his greatest works was a

-—>8278<*

drama founded on the history of Gottfried, the imperial knight
of the Middle Ages, and was called “ Gotz von Berlichingen.”
This work was received with enthusiasm throughout Germany.
It was like a trumpet call, appealing to the courage and chivalry
of the German spirit.

The following spring Goethe left Frankfort for Wetzlar, and
while there wrote “ Werther.” “Gotz” and “ Werther” were
read from one end of Germany to the other. “ Werther” was
translated into every language in Europe. '

Beside these’ two works, Goethe translated Goldsmith’s “ De-
serted Village,” and wrote a number of poems. His literary
success brought the young author a large number of friends, among
them the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weirnar. Goethe accepted the
duke’s invitation to visit his little capital. He was treated as

_ an honored guest and won the affection of all. The duke gave

him a little home near his palace, where he lived during the next
eight years.

After a time Goethe returned to Weimar and devoted his time
to writing history. He also began to write “ Wilhelm Meister’s
Apprenticeship,” which is ﬁlled with scenes from his own life.
In 1821 “Wilhelm Meister’s Travels” appeared. These books

are filled with truth, beauty, and life, and stand in the ﬁrst ranks

of the author’s works.

For many years he had had the story of “Faust” in his mind.
The ﬁrst part was published when he was sixty years old, in
company with a thirteen-volume edition of his worl3.e”"‘iiThis was
the crowning effort of Goethe’s life and the greatest of his works.

The second part of “Faust” was written after the poet had,

passed his seventieth birthday, and when it was completed Goethe
felt that his life work was over. —
His death occurred on the 15th of March, 1832.

I NEVER can forget that happy Christmas day. I see i

it still before me. I remember how surprised we were
when, after we had received our customary presents,
mother seated us before the door that leads to the other

room. The door opened, but not; as formerly, to let

us pass; the entrance Was occupied by an unexpected p

show. ;
Within it rose a porch concealed by a mysterious

curtain. All of us Were standing at a distance; our L

eagerness to see What glittering or jingling article

lay hid behind the half-transparent veil Was mount-

10

20

25

ing higher and higher, Wl181’liW8 were told to sit down V i

and Wait With patience.

At length we were all seated and silent; a Whistle
gave the signal; the curtain rolled aloft and showed
us the interior of the temple, painted in deep red colors.
The high-priest Samuel appeared With Jonathan, and
their strange voices seemed to me the most striking
thing on earth. '

Shortly after, Saul entered, overwhelmed with con-
-fusion at the impertinence of that giant Warrior who
had deﬁed him and all his people. How glad I was
When the valiant young son of Jesse, with his shep-
herd’s pouch and sling, came forth and said: “Dread
king and sovereign lord! let no one’s heart sinkdown
because of this. If your Majesty Will give me leave, I
Will go out to battle with this blustering giant.”

Here ended the ﬁrst act ;_ leaving the spectators more
curious than ever to see What further would happen,
and Wishing that the music might soon be done. At
last the curtain rose again. David devoted the ﬂesh of
the monster to the fowls of the air and the beasts of the

ﬁeld; the Philistine scorned _and bullied him, stamped  

»g29=3<~

mightily with his feet, and at length fell like a mass of
clay, affording a splendid ending for the piece. And
then the maidens sang “ Saul has slain his thousands,
but David his ten thousands!” The giant’s head was
borne before his little victor. ,

" Next morning, alas! the magic appa‘1_:_a_tus had van-
ished ; the  mystorious veil was carried away. My
brothers and sisters were running up and down With
their playthings ; I alone kept gliding to and fro; it
seemed to me impossible that two bare doorposts could
be all that now remained, where the night before so

. much enchagtment had displayed itself.

“ I can easily imagine,” said the mother, “ how these
things should lodge so ﬁrmly in your mind; I well re-
member what an interest you took in them; how you

  found the book and learned the whole piece by heart.

I then felt such a motherly contentment at your ﬁne

1o

recitation and good memory that I resolved to give I

the whole wooden troop to your own disposal.”

By good fortune this happened at a time when the
lieutenant—a young oﬁfcer who had made this little
theater himself and presented it to us children—had
himself been expressing a desire to initﬂ me into the
mysteries of the art. c He now contrived to persuade
my parents to offer him the use of two chambers in the

20

25

top story of the house, that he might accommodate the .

spectators in one, while the other held his actors.
At last the wished-for day arrived. At ﬁve in the
evening, my insgnctor came and took me upstairs with

sides of the framework the puppets all hanging in order,
as they were to advance to view.

I considered them carefully, mounted the steps which
raised them above the scene, and hovered aloft above
that -little world. Not without re;_Le_1_'_ence did I look

. down between the pieces of board and recollect what

25

a glorious effect the whole would produce, and feel into
What mighty secrets I was now admitted. We made
a trial which succeeded well.

A party of children were invited on the next day.
We performed rarely, except that once, in the ﬁre of
action, I let poor Jonathan fall, and was obliged to
reach down with my hand and pick him up again; an
accident which sadly ma_rred the illusion, produced a
peal of laughter, and vexed.y.1;r,_1e greatly. My father,

however, seemed to relish this misfortune not a little.

Prudently hiding his contentment at the expertness of his
little boy, after the piece was ﬁnished he dwelt on the
mistakes we had committed, saying it would all have
been very pretty had not this or that gone wrong with us.

I was vexed to the heart at these things and sad for all
the evening. By next morning, however, I had quite
slept off my sorrow and was blest in the persuasion
that, but for this one fault, I had played delightfully.
The spectators also ﬂattered me with their unanimous
approval; they all maintained that though the lieu"-
tenant, in regard to the coarse and the ﬁne voices, had
done great things, yet his declamation was in general

‘ myself.

his Jonathan and David With exquisite grace. My
mother in particular commended the gallant tone in
Which I had challenged Goliath and acted the modest
victor before thefking.

From this time, to my extreme delight, the theater
continued open; and as the spring advanced, so that
ﬁres could be dispensed With, I passed all my hours of
recreation lying in the garret and making the puppets
caper and play together.

Often I invited my comrades, or my brothers and
sisters; but when they Would not come, I stayed by
My imagination brooded over that tiny World.
My greatest pleasure lay in the inventive part and the
employment of my fancy. But it happened With me
as it often happens With children; they embrace Wide
plans, make mighty preparations, then a few trials, and
the Whole undertaking is ab_ap/doned. I

This or that piece inspired me With interest for a few
scenes of it, and» immediately I set about providing new
costumes suitable for the occasion; I surrendered my-
self to my imagination; I rehearsed and prepared for-
ever; built a thousand castles in the air, and saw not
that I was at the same time undermining the founda-
tions of these little ediﬁces.

THE DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTROM.

[ABR1DGED.]

EDGAR ALLAN POE.

EDGAR ALLAN Pon was born in Boston on the 19th of Janu-
ary, 1809. His father and mother were actors and died in

.Richmond, Va., when Edgar was but two years old. A
The beauty and attractive manners of. the boy won the atten-

tion of Mr. John Allan, a wealthy gentleman living at Richmond,
and he adopted the little fellow.

Edgar was an interesting child, bright, loving, and generous.
He was dressed like a little prince and had his own pony and dogs
and la groom, with whom he rode every day. He soon showed
a love of poetry and repeated long passages to visitors with such
appreciation of their meaning as to delight his hearers. At the
age of eleven Edgar attended‘ a school at Richmond. He was a

_ very apt pupil, progressing rapidly in Latin and Greek, and

15

20

25

30

showing a deep love of poetry. He began to write poems to his
girl playmates before he was ten years old.

His schoolmates found him a brave, unselﬁsh boy, championing
those who were weak, and taking many a hard blow in defending
his friends. , Al _ »

After leaving this school, Poe entered the University of Vir-
ginia, and was a successful student during his year there. While
at college he had engaged in gambling, and when Mr. Allan
learned of debts of this kind he refused to pay them. Edgar

then left him in anger, going to the home of his father’s sister,

.Mrs. Clemm. « '

Upon the death of his adopted mother, he hastened to his child-
hood’s home. Mr. Allan became reconciled to him andobtained
for him a West Point scholarship. He entered the military school
when he was twenty-one, and for a time was a diligent student;
but he became restless and determined to leave. Mr. Allan would
not consent to this, but Poe neglected his duties and conducted
himself in so disorderly a manner that he was expelled.

+8338“

He returned to Richmond for a while and then enlisted in the
army, but was taken ill, and his friends procured his discharge.
About the year. 1832 a Baltimore paper called “ The Saturday

  Visitor” offered two prizes——one for the best tale and the other

for the best poem. 5

Poe sent a poein and a number of tales which so fascinated

the judges that it was with difficulty that they decided upon one.
“ The Descent into the Maelstrom”
was at ﬁrst chosen, but “A MS.
Found in a Bottle” was ﬁnally
preferred, and received the hun-
dred—do1lar prize.

Poe spent several years in Bal-
timore, writing for periodicals, but
after a time went to New York
and accepted the invitation of
some literary men to join them
in editing a paper. . After a year
in New York, Poe removed to
Philadelphia and became editor of
amagazine. Some" of his best
prose tales were written at this time, among them “Ligeia,”

-which was inspired by a dream.

He was married in Baltimore to his cousin, Virginia Clemm.
Their home was a happy one, and the poet was devoted to his 25
wife, who was an invalid. In his poem “Annabel Lee” he
touchingly describes her loving character. He returned to New
York, and it was there that “The Raven,” his greatest poem,
was written. The fame gained by its publication assisted him
in bringing out a new edition of his poetry and two volumes of 30
tales. .

In 1846 Poe removed to Fordham, N. Y., where he lived in a
picturesque little cottage at the top of a bill. He was greatly
saddened by the illness of his wife and his poverty.

The last year of Poe’s life was ﬁlled with dark scenes, and he 35
died at Baltimore on the 7th of October, 1849.

WE had now reached the summit of the loftiest
crag. For some minutes the old man seemed too
much exhausted to speak.

“Not long ago,” said he at length, “Icould have I

5 guided you on this route as well as the youngest of my
sons; but, about three years past, there happened to
.me an event such as never happened before to mortal
man, -—or at least such as no man ever survived to tell
of,—and the sixhours of deadly terror which I then
.10 endured have broken 1ne up body and soul. Do you
know I can scarcely look over this little cliff without
getting giddy? H I
“ We are now,” he continued, “ upon the Norwegian
coast. The mountain upon whose top we sit is Hel-

'15 seggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up a little

higher——holdon to the grass if you feel giddy——so———
and look out, beyond the belt of vapor beneath us, into
the sea.”   I I  
I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean.
20 To the right and left, as far as the eye could reach,
there lay outstretched, lines of black and beetling cliﬂ.
“ Do you hear anything? Do you see any change
in the water ‘.7 ’-’ exclaimed the old man.
As he spoke I became aware of a loud and gradually
25 increasing sound, like the .moaning of a vast herd of
4 buﬁaloes upon an American prairie. In ﬁve minutes
I the whole seawas lashed into ungovernable fury ; but

' it was between Moskoe and the coast thatthe main

uproar held its sway. Here the vast bed of the waters

->8 35 

burst suddenly into frenzied con_y}_1lsion,—heaving, boil-
ing, hissing,—and all whirling and plunging on to

f the eastward.

’’ The edge of the whirl, which was more than a mile
in diameter, was represented by a broad belt of gleam-
ing 'spray; but no particle of this slipped into the
mouth of the terriﬁc funnel, whose interior, as far as
the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and
jet-black wall of water, speeding dizzily round and
round, and sending forth to the winds an appalling
voice, half shriek, half roar, such as not even the

. mighty cataract of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony

to Heaven.
The mountain trembled to its very base.
“ This,” I cried, “ this can be nothing else than the
great whirlpool of the Maelstrom!” A
'‘‘So it is sometimes termed,” said he. “We Nor-
wegians call it the Moskoe-str'om, from the island of
Moskoe in the midway. ,
‘‘ Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-

T10

20

rigged smack of about seventy tons burden, with which i A

we were in the habit of ﬁshing among the islands be-

e yond Moskoe.

.“ It is now within a few days of three years since
what I am going to tell you occurred. It was on the
10th of July, 18—. The three of us — my two brothers

, and myself—-had crossed over to the islands about two

o’clock P.M., and soon nearlyloaded the smack with

ﬁne ﬁsh. It was just seven, by my watch, when we

, weighed andstarted for home, so as to make the worst
of the Strom at slackwater, which we knew would be
at eight.

“ We set out with a fresh wind at our starboard

5 quarter, and for some time sped along at a great rate,
never dreaming of danger. All at once we were taken
aback by a breeze from over Helseggen. We put the
boaton the wind, but could make no headway at all
for the eddies, and I was upon the point of proposing

10 to return to the anchorage, when, looking astern, we
saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-

c colored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.

  “In less than a minute the storm -was upon us; in
less than two the sky was entirely overcast; and what

15 with this and the driving spray, it became suddenly so
dark that we could not see each other in the smack.

* “ Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt
describing. At the ﬁrst puff, both our masts went by
the board as if they had been sawed off—the main-

20 mast taking with it my youngest brother, who had
lashed himself to it for safety.

. “ For some moments we were completely deluged, but
presentlyzour little boat gave herself a shake, just as a
dog does in coming out of the water, and, thus rid her-

25 self, in some measure, of the seas. I was now trying
to get the betterof the stupor that had come over me,
and to collect my senses so as to see what was to be
done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. It was my

elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had

felt sure that he was overboard; but the next mo-
ment all this joy was turned into horror, for he put
his mouth close to my ear and screamed out the Word
‘ Moskoe-strom I ’ v

“I knew what he meant by that one word well
enough—é-I knew what he wished to make me under-
stand. With the wind that now drove us on, we were
bound for the whirl of the Strom and nothing could
save us!   '

“A singular change had come over the heavens.

Around in every direction it was still as black as pitch, '
_ but nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, a cir-

cular rift of clear sky—as clear as I ever saw—and
of a deep, bright blue ——and through it there blazed
forth the full moon with a luster that I never before

came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge that made
me feel sick and dizzy, as if I were falling from some
lofty mountain-top in a dream. But while we were up
I had thrown a quick glance around; and that one
I saw our exact position in

an instant. The Moskoe-strom whirlpool was about a

‘quarter of a mile dead ahead—but no more like the

everyday Moskoe—stri)'m than the Whirl as you now
see it like a mill-race. I  

.“It could not have been more than two minutes after-
ward when we suddenly felt the waves subside and were
enveloped in foam. We were now in the belt of surf that
always surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course,
that another moment would plunge us into the abyss.

“It may appear strange, but now, when we were in
the very jaws of the gulf, I felt more composed than
when we were only approaching it. I began to reﬂect
how magniﬁcent a thing it was to die in such a
manner, and how foolish it was in me to think of so
paltry a consideration as my own individual life, in
view of so wonderful a manifestation of God’s power.
After a little while I became possessed with the keen-
est curiosity, about the whirl itself. I positively felt a
wish to explore its depths, even at the sacriﬁce I was
going to make. \

“We careered round and round for perhaps an hour,
ﬂying rather than ﬂoating, going gradually more and
more into the middle of the surge, and then nearer and
nearer to its horrible inner edge. Suddenly we gave

-98398“,

a wild lurch to starboard and rushed headlong into the
abyss. W

“ Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror,
and admiration with which I gazed about me. The
boat appeared to be hanging, as if by magic, midway
down, upon the interior surface of afunnel vast and
deep, whose perfectly smooth sides might have been
mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity
with which they spun around, and for the gleaming
and ghastly radiance they shot forth, as the rays of
the full moon from that circular rift amid the clouds
whichI have already described streamed in a ﬂood of

‘ golden glory along the black walls, and far away down

into the inmost recesses of the abyss.
“The rays of the moon seemed to search thevery

I   bottom of the profound gulf, over which there hung a

magniﬁcent rainbow.
“ Both‘ above and below us were visible fragments of

vessels, large masses of building timber, and trunks of

trees, with many smaller articles. I called to mind the
great variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast
of Lofoden, having been absorbed and then thrown
forth by the Moskoe-strom. By far the greater num-
ber of the articles were shattered in the most extraor-
dinary way ; but then I distinctly recollected that there
were some of them which were not disﬁgured at all.

i“‘ I resolved to lash isnyself securely to a water cask,

10

to cut it loose, and to throw myself with it into the .

water. I'tried to induce my brother to do likewise,

  but he shook his head despairingly and refused to move.

The emergency admitted of no delay; and so with a
bitter struggle I resigned him to his fate, fastened
myself to‘ the cask, and precipitated myself with it into
the sea, without anothermoiment’s hesitation.

“ The result was precisely what I had hoped it might
It might have been an hour, or thereabout, after
my quitting the smack, when, having descended to a
vast distance beneath me, it made three or four wild
gyrations in rapid succession, and, bearing my loved
brother with it, plunged headlong, at once and forever,
into the chaos of foam below. The barrel to which
I was attached sank very little farther than half the
distance between the bottomof the gulf and the spot

at which I leaped overboard, before a great change _

took place in the character of the whirlpool. The slope

of the sides of the vast funnel became less and less .

steep; The gyrations of the whirl grew gradually less
and less violent. By degrees the froth and the rainbow
disappeared, and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly
to uprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gone down,
and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west,
when I found myself on the surface of the ocean, in
full view ofthe shores of Lofoden, and above the spot
where the pool of the Moskoe-strom had been. I was
borne violently into the channel of the Strom, and in
a few minutes was hurried?’ down the coast into the
grounds of the ﬁshermen, where a boat picked me up.”

THE ALB§rRoss.
SAMUEL TAYLOR" COLERIDGE.

SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE was born in England on the
21st of October, 17 7 2. His father was both vicar and school-
master of the parish.

Samuel was theyoungest of thirteen children. He was a
sensitive, delicate child, with a vivid imagination, and loved to 5
be by himself.

He began his education at the free grammar school, and Was
found to have a remarkable mind. His father died before he
was nine years old, and the boy
felt his loss deeply. The mother
was poor, and Samuel was sent to
London to live with an uncle, never
returning to his native town ex-
cept on occasional visits. The
scenes of his early home were,
however, so impressed upon his
memory that he afterwards said
that Whenever he closed his eyes
in the sunlight he saw afresh the
Waters of the Otter, its vvillowy  
banks, the plank that crossed it, and the sand of varied tints
that lay in its bed.

After spending three months in London, Coleridge was ad-
mitted to the charity school at Christ’s Hospital. There Was
little in his life to make him happy, but he Was obliged to remain 25
there from eight to nine years. He made some Warm friends,
among them a timid, sensitive boy named Charles Lamb, who in
after years became famous, under the pen-name of “ Elia,” as the
author of a number of quaint and charming essays. .

Coleridge Was a born poet, and inspite of his hardship began 30
writing poems during these school days. He used to act out
What he had read, and imagine himself the hero of legend or

history. Lamb wrote of him: “ The walls of the old Grey.
Friars reéchoed to the accents of the inspired charity boy!”
Coleridge entered Cambridge University when he was nineteen.
He enjoyed the social life there, and his rooms at college became
a center of attraction. In spite of this, his life was not happy
and he ﬂed from college, enlisting under an assumed name in a
regiment of dragoons. He was a poor horseman, but a favorite

  in camp because of his gift at telling stories and his readiness to
‘nurse the sick and write letters for his comrades.
One day he wrote a Latin quotation on‘ a stall, and an officer, .

seeing that he was a scholar, made him hisorderly. It was part
of Coleridge’s duty to walk behind his officer in the streets, where
he was recognized one day by a student, and his friends procured
his discharge. > M

He returned to Cambridge, and was soon busily engaged in his
studies. ,

During the vacation of his last year at Cambridge, Coleridge
visited one of his old school-fellows at Bristol. While there he
made the acquaintance of Sara Fricker, who became his wife
in October of 1795. He, in company with other friends, had

decided to go to America and there establish a colony, but their i

plan was given up.

Coleridge had sold some poems for thirty guineas, and with
this sum he started in life. He found a pretty little cottage
at Clevedon, near Bristol. It was one story high, with a rose
tree peeping in at the window. Here the youthful pair began
their married life. .

Literature now became his chosen profession. His ﬁrst vol-
ume of poems was published when he was twenty-four years old.
This was followed by a volume of sonnets; and still later, he

published his “ Ode to the Departing Year.”

35

Hartley Coleridge, the poet’s ﬁrst son, was born during the next

fall; and soon after the family went to Nether Stowey. Coleridge 5

had made the acquaintance of Wordsworth. The latter moved to
Alfoxden and the two poets became lifelong friends. « At this

time Coleridge wrote “ The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” “ The I

Dark Ladie,” and the ﬁrst part of “Christabel,” and was also
engaged in writing for several newspapers. H
“The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” was planned during a
walk, and the story of the albatross was suggested by Words-
worth. For two years Coleridge led a happy life. He then
became discouraged and burdened by debt. Some friends fur-
nished him with the necessary funds and he sailed for Germany,
remaining there about a year. i
I In the summer of 1800 Coleridge took his family to Greta
Hall, near Keswick. A painful disease led him to take drugs,
and he became a slave to the use of opium.

-10

Coleridge soon left Keswick and went to London, where he i

lived in poverty. A friend had left him a pension, and the poet
set it aside for the support of his family.

His poems had at this time become well known, and he might
have spent his last years in comfort had it not been for his

15

terrible bondage; but the last twenty years of his life were spent C

in wretchedness and failure.

Coleridge died on the 25th of July, 1834. Life had lost hope
His
works are exquisite in thought and expression, and command
the admiration of all true lovers of poetry.

PART I.

THE ship was cheered, the harbor cleared,
Merrily did we drop C

Below the kirk, below the hill,

Below the livgdhthouse top. .

The Sun came up upon the left,

Out of the sea came he!

And he shone bright, and on the right
Went down into the sea. C

20

+84-4-8+

And now the Storm—blast came, and he
Was tyrannous and strong:

He struck\with his o’ertaking wings,
And chased us south along.

With sloping masts and dipping prow,

As who pursued with yell and blow

Still treads the shadow of his foe,

And forward bends his head,

The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,
And southward aye we ﬂed.

And now there came both mist and snow,
And it grew Wondrous cold;

And ice, mast-high, came ﬂoating by,

As green as emerald.

And through the drifts the snowy clifts
Did send a dismal sheen:   .

Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken—
The ice was all between. A

The ice was here, the ice was there,

The ice was all around:

It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,
Like noises in aswound!

  At length did cross an Albatross:

Thorough the fog it came;  
As if it had been a Christian soul,
We hailed it in God’s name.

+84-58<+

It ate the food it ne’er had eat,
And round and round it ﬂew.

The ice didesplit with a thunder-ﬁt ;
The helinsman steered us through! .

And a good south wind sprung up behind;
The Albatross did follow,

And every day, for food or play,

Came to the mariner’s hollo!

In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,

It perched for Vespers nine; -

Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,
Grliinrnered the white moon-shine.

“ God save thee, ancient Mariner!

From the ﬁends, that plaguebitvhee thus ! ——
Why 1ook’st thou so?” —-——With my cross-bow
I shot the Albatross.

PART II. ‘

The Sun now rose upon the right :
Out of the seacarne he,

Still hid in mist, and on the left
Went down into the sea.

And the good. south wind still blew behind,
But no sweet bird did follow,
Nor any day for food or play
Came to the mariner’s hollo!

“FOR ALL AVERRED I HAD KILLED THE BIRD.”

For all averred I had killed the bird   L
That made the breeze to blow.
Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay,
That made the breeze to blow!

The fair breeze blew, the white foam ﬂew,
The furrow followed free;

We were the ﬁrst that ever burst

Into that silent sea.

Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,  

’T was sad as sad could be; 
And we did speak only to break T
The silenceof the sea!

All in a hot and copper sky,

The bloody Sun, ‘at noon, A

Right up above the mast did stand,
No bigger than the Moon.

Day after day, day after day,

We stuck, nor breath nor motion;
As idle as a painted ship

Upon a painted ocean.

Water, Water, everywhere,

And all the boards did shrink; _
Water, Water, everywhere,

Nor any drop to drink.

About, about, in reel and rout
The death—ﬁres danced at night ;
The Water, like a Witch’s oils,
Burnt green, and blue, and White.

And every tongue, through utter drought,
Was withered, at the root;

We could not speak, no more than if

We had been choked with soot.

Ah! Well-a-day! ‘What evil looks
Had I‘ from old and young!
Instead ofthe cross, the Albatross
About my neck was hung.

From “ The Ancient Mariner.”

 

' PICCIOLA.

 

A X. B. SAINTINE.

X. B. SAINTINE, the pen name of a well-known~French writer,
was born at Paris in 1798. His earliest works were so full of
goodicheer and sympathy that they won many readers.

Saintine received a prize for his writings   from the French

5 Academy when he was but twenty-one, and two years later a

second prize was awarded him by the same Academy. .
In 1823 he published abook ofpoems; but his most famous
work is “ Picciola.” The story is beautifullytold, and its charm

‘ seems everlasting.

10

The Academy awarded it a prize of three thousand francs, and

’_ ' (decorated the author with the cross of the Legion of Honor.

 Saintine laid aside his writing during his later years -and

i enjoyed a peaceful and happy old age, surrounded by his many

25

friends and all the comforts of life.
1865. v

ONE‘ day Charney was breathing the fresh air in the -

little court of the fortress, his head declining, his eyes
downcast, his arms crossed» behind him, pacing with

a slow and measured steps.

Spring was breaking. A milder air breathing around

tantalized him with a vain inclination to enjoy‘. tihe,
season at liberty. He was proceeding tb number,‘._op£

by one, the stones paving the courtyard,when he peré‘

ceived ~ a small mound of earth rising between two

stones of the pavement, cleft slightly at the summit. 
The Count stopped short, his heart beat hurriedly.

Who could decide that this -triﬂing irregularity on A

the surface might not indicate important operations
underground? Perhaps his former friends had been
mining to procure--access to his dungeon and restore
him to light and liberty- He listened! He fancied he

could detect a low murmur. He raised his head, and 5

the loud and rapid clangof the tocsin saluted his ear.
The ramparts were echoing with the prolonged roll of  
drums, like the call to arms in time of war. Is his
liberation at hand? Has France a new ruler?  
, Again he lends a listening ear, and the same noises 710
recur; but they mislead him no longer. The supposed
tocsin is only the «church-bell which he has been accus-
tomed to hear daily at the same hour; and the drums,
the usual evening signal for retreat to quarters. With
a bitter smile Charney begins to pity his own ' folly 15
which could mistake the insigniﬁcant labors of some -
wandering mole or ﬁeld-mouse for the result of human
ﬁdelity. l a y i H
Resolved, however, to bring the matter to the test,

Charney, bending over the little hillock, gently removed 20  

the earth from its summit; when he had» the mortiﬁ-
cation. to perceive that the wild though ‘momentary
emotion by which  had been overcome was not pro-
 by much4 aswthe labors of an animal armed

with the sweets of some bower of honeysuckles or.

syringas swept past, as if to intercede formercy toward
the poor plant, which might perhaps hereafter reward
him with its ﬂowers and fragrance.

A new thought led him to -suspend his act of ven-

geance. How had this tender plant, so soft and fragile _

» as to be crushed with a touch, contrived to pierce and

10

15

"cleave asunder the soil, dailytrodden by his own foot-

steps, and all but cemented to the ﬂags of granite be-

tween which it was enclosed? On stooping again to

examine the matter with more attention, he observed

at the extremity of the plant a sort of ﬂeshy lobe,

affording protection to its ﬁrst and tenderest leaves
from the injurious contact of any hard bodiesthat they

might have to encounter in penetrating the earthy a
crust in search of light and air.

‘ s“ This then is the secret!” cried he, already inter-
ested in the discovery. “ Nature has imparted strength
to the vegetable germ, even as the unﬂedged bird which  

is able to_ break asunder with its beak the eggshell in

which it is imprisoned; happier than myself——-in pos-V

session of instruments to secure its liberation!” And
after gazing another minute on the inoffensive plant,
he lost all inclination for its destruction. A . A  

On resuming his walk the next day, with wide and
careless steps, Charney was on the pointiof setting his’
foot on it, but drew back in time. Amused to ﬁnd
himself interested in the preservation O%}«.a:_ weed,‘ he

  paused to take note of its progress. The iiplant. was

*>851l8<-

strangely grown, and the free light of day had already
effaced the pale and sickly complexion of the preced-

ing day. Charney was struck by the power in plants —

to absorb rays of light, and, strengthened by the nour-

  ishment, to borrow, as it were, from the prism, the very

colors destined to distinguish its various parts.

“ The leaves,” thought he, “ will probably imbibe a
hue different from that of the stem. And the ﬂowers?
what color, I wonder, will be the ﬂowers?
by the same sap as the green leaves and stem, how do
they manage to acquire from the inﬂuence of the sun
their tints of azure, pink, or scarlet? For already
their hue is appointed. But lo, the ﬂeshy lobes which
served to facilitate the plant’s progress through the

  soil, though now useless, are feeding themselves at its

expense, and weighing upon its slender stalk.”

’ Even as he spoke, daylight became obscured. A
chilly spring evening, threatening a frosty night, was
settingin 3 and the two lobes; gradually rising, seemed
to reproach him by enclosing the still tender foliage,
which theysecured from the attacks of insects or the
inclemency of the weather by the screen of their pro-
tecting' wings. In the weariness of captivity Charney
was soon satisﬁed to occupy his idle hours in observing
the changes in the plant. But when he attempted to

much for him.

“To what purpose these stiﬂ bristles, disﬁguring a_

ing morning he found them covered with frost; thanks
to their defence, the delicate bark had been secured
from all contact with the rime.

“ To what purpose, for the summer season, this win-
ter garment of wool and down?” he again inquired.
And .when the summer season really breathed upon
the plant, he found the new shoots array themselves
in their light spring clothing, the downy Vestments
being laid aside. i

“Storms may be impending!” cried Charney with

a bitter smile; “ and how yvill these slender and ﬂex-
ible shoots resist the cutting hail, the driving wind?”
But when the stormy rain arose and the winds blew,

the slender plant, yielding to their force, replied to the

sneers of the Count by prudent prostration. Against

a the hail it fortiﬁed itself in a different way; the leaves,

20

25

rapidly uprising, clung to the stalks for protection,
presenting to the attacks of the enemy the strength of
their under surface; and union, as usual, produced
strength. Firmly closed together they deﬁed the pelt-
ing shower, and the plant remained the master of the
ﬁeld. , '

Count Charney delighted'”in watching day by day

the constant changes of the plant. Even after his‘

return to his cell he often watched the little solitary

after his little boy, and, taking fromihis box at small

Ludovico refused the gift; but Charney resolved to,
persevere. _“,I,_;am/aware that a toy, a rattle, a ﬂower

made his «plea.   I

“ Is it a gillyﬂower?” interrupted Charneyv Wlth*

‘ “ How should I know? All ﬂowers are more or less
gillyﬂowers. But as to sparing the life of yours,me-
thinks the request comes late in the day. My boot

  “ Oh, as to my fpartiality,” interrupted Charney, “I,

beg to assure you ” —    
“ Tut, tut! What need of assurance?” cried Ludo-

vico. ""‘"Men must have something to love; and state

have sworn it was a muff when it was asleep! —-a cat
that my wife doted on, to say nothing of myself.
Well, I gave it away, lest the creature should take a
fancy to some of their favorites. All the cats in crea-
tion ought not to weigh against so much as,a mouse

belonging to a captive!”

Charney became daily more attached to the object
of his care, and had the satisfaction of seeingthe plant
expand and acquire new beauties every hour. “If it
would but ﬂower!” he frequently exclaimed.  “ What
a delight to hail the opening of its ﬁrst blossom! a blos-
som whose beauty, whose fragrance will be developed
for the sole enjoyment of my eager senses. What will
be its color, I wonder? what the form of its petals?
Time will show. How I long for the moment! Bloom,
Picciola! bloom, and reveal yourself in all your beauty
to him to whom you are indebted for the preservation
of your life! ” W W ‘

Picciola [poor little thing] was the name, borrowed ~

  c from the lips of Ludovico, which Charney had bestowed

25

upon his favorite.
Returning one morning to the accustomed spot, the
Count’s eyes were suddenly attracted toward a shoot of

unusual form gracing the principal stem of the plant. ,

He felt the beating of his heart accelerated, and,
ashamed of his weakness, the color rose to his cheek
as he stooped to examine it. The spherical shape,

~>8558<~

covered with glossy scales, announced a bud! Eureka!
—a ﬂower must be at hand!

One evening, after his customary visit to Picciola, an
attack of faintness overpowered him; he threw himself
on the bed, with aching brows and shivering limbs.
He fancied sleep would restore him. But instead of
sleep came pain and fever; and on the morrow, when

the tried to rise, an inﬂuence stronger than his will

held him to his pallet, and there he remained for many
days. "

As the convalescence of the Count proceeded, he was
seated one morning in his chamber, when the door was

' suddenly burst open, and Ludovico, with a radiant

countenance, rushed into the room.

.“ Victory!” cried he. “ The creature is in bloom!

see her— I must see the blossom.”

In vain did the jailer implore the Count to delay the
undertaking for a day or two. Charney was deaf to
all remonstrance. ‘He consented only to wait an hour,
in order that the sun might become one of the party.

At the appointed moment Ludovico reappeared, to
offer the Count de Charney the support of his arm
down" the steep steps of the stone staircase. !

THE _BATTLE AT MANILA.

THOMAS J.. VIVIAN.
PART 1.

WHEN We arrived off Subig Bay on the afternoon of

Saturday, April 30, 1898, the Commodore called the  

commanding oﬂicers of the ships over to his cabin and
outlined to them his plan of attack.

He told them he had every reason to believe that the A

Spaniards Were in Manila Bay, and that his purpose Was
to carry out the President’s instructions and destroy
their ﬂeet. We were told that the ﬁrst thing Was to
slip into the bay, and if possible to pass the shore forts
Without drawing their ﬁre. ’ .

Sunday morning came on still and hot, and before
dawn the ﬂeet steamed slowly into the harbor. First
Went the ﬂagship “Olympia,” then the “Baltimore,”
then the “Raleigh,” next the “Petrel,” following her
the “Concord,” and last the “Boston.”
ﬁghting ﬂeet came the supply ships.

As We rounded out beyond the last point before
reaching the entrance, We saW the lights of the great
cone of Corregidor burning bright and still, but saw
nothing in the shape of a searchlight. Every man Was
called up and ordered to Wash and take a cup of coffee.
While this lightand early refreshment, Was being served
all the ships’ lights Were extinguished, except those on

~>5588<~

until we came into the channel, moving in single
ﬁle. ”
In that still air it seemed absolutely impossible for us.
to escape the attention of the entrance forts, yet we
5 would all have been inside—squadron, supply ships,
and conVoy—without the Spanish ﬂeet receiving the
. faintest intimation of our approach if it had not been
for an enthusiastic ﬁreman. Throwing open the fur-
nace doors, he ladled in a few shovelfuls of soft coal.
10 Up from the smokestack of the cutter went a great
shower of sparks. '
Some minutes elapsed before out of the west there
came a bugle call, then a ﬂash, and then the rolling boom
of a great gun. ‘ T
15 Twice more the battery spoke, and with the third
shot there came a crack from the “Concord,” and we
-knew that our ﬁrst shot had gone out in the shape of
a four-inch shell. Then still further back of us the
“Boston” sent in an eight-inch.’ shell, and still further
20 to the rear the “Me Culloch” sounded a few of her
four-pounders.       ‘

The batteries kept on ﬂashing and booming a few. .

T minutes longer, and then became as silent as they were
before we had steamed up. w.

25 s As soon as we had passed the batteries at the har-.

bor mouth we slowed down, until it seemed as though
we were almost at a standstill. The Commodore was
talking in ‘an undertone to the rebel Filippino who

’ was acting as pilot; I could see the ﬁgures of the

~>a598<+

men standing silently at their posts up and down the
ship ; and looking over her sides I could distinguish no
line of demarcation between the dull gray of the vessels
and the dark waters of the bay through which we were
so slowly slipping. -

This creeping, creeping, creeping, with invisible mines
below us and an invisible ﬂeet ahead, was a test out of
which no man came without a sigh of relief. We were
all keyed up, but it was not long before the fighting
string in every man’s heart was twanging and singing
like that of a taut bow.

As is the fashion of nature in these parts, the dawn

i turned as suddenly into day as though a curtain had

been torn down from the sunlight, and there right
ahead of us lay the Spanish ﬂeet tucked up under the
forts of Cavité. ‘ '

’ Commodore Dewey’s ﬂeet consisted of seven vessels,
exclusive of the transports.
two gunboats, one cutter, ﬁfty-seven classiﬁed big
guns, seventy-four rapid ﬁrers and machine guns, and
ohe thousand eight hundred and eight men. .

Against us were pitted seven cruisers, ﬁve gunboats,‘
two torpedo boats,ﬁfty—two classiﬁed big guns, eighty-
three rapid ﬁrers and machine guns, and one thousand
nine hundred and forty-eight men.

It cannot be denied that we had a greater number

of heavy guns and that our ships were of modern con-‘ i

struction, nor must it be overlooked that the Spanish

' ﬂeet was much more numerous, and that p the

strong garrisons and mounting an unknown number

A of guns, of whose caliber andforce we had been told‘ S 

most terrifying things.    
5 As we passed on the eastward curve before actually
beginning the engagement, our lookouts reported that
. Admiral Montojo’s‘ ﬂag was ﬂying on the cruiser “ Reina

Cristina.” They reported also that the Spaniards ap—»

peared to be protected by a_, sort of roughly con-

1o structed boom of logs.
As we steamedslowly along then, after dropping the
supply ships, there came a ﬂash of ﬂame and a boom
” from the bastions of Cavité, followed immediately by
another ﬂame and a sharper report from one of the
.15 Spanish ﬂagship’s modern guns. Both shots dropped
somewhere in the bay, and our only answer was in
-sendingup a string of ﬂags bearing the code watch-
word, “ Remember the ‘Maine ’ ! ” -
oi steamed the ﬂeet, with every gun loaded‘ and

.20 every man at his post; but not a lanyard was pulled.
Even the Spaniards at Cavité ceased ﬁring as awe;
moved down toward iManila. As we rounded past

the‘ city’s water-front, with about four miles of blue
water between us and it, we could with our glasses

25 make out the city walls, church towers, and other.

high places, crowded with sight-seers. As We turned f

from Manila, the Commodore said something about the A

picturesqueness of the city, adding that the blue hills? _
at the back ofthe town reminded him of those of Ver-p A

  mont. It was most unaffectedly said, and was no more

tinged With bravado than was Captain Wildes’s use of
a palm-leaf fan during the engagement. p

~:A.swe headed toward the Spanish ﬂeet, their gunners
and those of the forts began a right merry fusillade.
With all this thundering and snapping of the Span-
iards, however, there was no answer fromius. Up
went the signal, “ Hold your ﬁre until close in,” and
on went the squadron. , Suddenly something happened.
Close off the bow of the “Baltimore” there came a

» shaking of the bay and a geyser of mud and water.
_ Then right ahead of the “ Raleigh” came another ugly

fountain of harbor soil and water.  
We were among the mines at last.  
But we did" not strike any. These two upheavals

imarked the extent of our experience with the “ terri-

ble mines ” of Manila Bay. The Commodore, his chief

of staff, Commander Lamberton, the executive ofﬁcer,,

Lieutenant Reese, and the navigator were on the for-
ward -bridge. Captain Gridley was in the conning
tower. With a glance at the shore the Commodore

ﬁve thousand yards I should say; eh, Reese?”
“ Between that and six thousand, I should think,
sir,” Reese answered. a
The Commodore r then leaned over the railing and
called out :——- , T  
“ When you are ready you may ﬁre, Grridley.”

was at the center of the Spanish ﬂeet, the “ Clympia’s ”
shot being particularly directed, as a sort of interna-
tional mark of courtesy, to the “Reina Cristina.”

Their ship and
shore guns seemed to unite in one unending snap and
roar, while the scream of their shot, the bursting of
shells, made up a din that was as savage as it was
unceasing. It was, however, but as the scraping of
ﬁddle strings to the blare and crash of a full orchestra
When compared with that which was to follow. '

One wailing, shrieking shell was making straight for

the “cOlympia’s ” forward bridge when it exploded about

a hundred feet infront of. us, one fragment sawing the
rigging just over our heads. Another fragment chis-
elled a long splinter from the deck just under where
the Commodore stood ; a third smashed the bridge grat-
ings, and all around and about and above us there was
the sputter and shriek. and roar of projectiles. j

But the C miracle was that none of us was hit.
Through this hail of miraculously impotent steel we
steered until within a distance of T four thousand yards
of the Spanish column. C

“ Open with all the guns,” said the Commodore; and  
they were opened. That is,all on the port broadside. C

smoking as We Went. As We passed, the batteries on
shore and the Spanish batteries aﬂoat banged away at

us, ﬁghting gallantly and furiously. One shot Went

clean through the “Baltimore,” but hit no one. An-
other cut the signal halyards from Lieutenant Brum-
by’s hands on the after bridge. Another shell passed
through the “Boston’s” foremast, not far from Where

THE BATTLE AT MANILA.

THOMAS J. VIVIAN.

PART II.

IT was on the third‘ turn that the great naval duel
between the two ﬂagships took place.  

When we sighted the Spanish ﬂeet, I remarked that
the enemy seemed to have no steam up, and that the
ﬂeet seemed to lie behind a breakwater. As we came
closer to them, however, we saw more clearly the
scheme of their order. Put out your right hand with

arsenal with its boom extension. Behind this boom
lay the gunboats of the Spanish ﬂeet, while in front of
it, facing Manila Bay, were the Spanish cruisers.

They lay anchored while we made our ﬁrst and’
second parallels of attack, but by the time we were
sweeping u_p on the third course the smoke poured
out of the “Reina Cristina’s ’,’ smokestacks; there was
a ﬂeece of white gathered about the steam pipe, and

the ﬂagship moved out to the attack. She gallantly
stood for the “ Olympia,” and it looked as though it were
her intention to ram us. The Commodore passed the
word to concentrate all possible ﬁre on the “ Reina Cris-
tina,” and she actually shivered under the battering of
our storm of shot and shell. Rents appeared near her

' water-line where the eight—inch shells had torn their

10

20

25

way. One shot struck the port bridge on which Ad-

‘miral Montojo stood, upon which, like the brave man

he was, the Admiral coolly stepped to the other end.

But no bravery could stand the driving, crushing,
rending of the tons of steel which we poured into the
“ Cristina,” and there was quite a little cheer from our
forward men as the Spanish ﬂagship slowly turned and
made for the shore.

In the whole duel between the “Cristina” and the

"‘ Olympia” sixty of the Spanish crew were killed, in-

cluding the chaplain and the ﬁrst lieutenant. It was
small wonder she retreated. Itwas during the fright-
ful hubbub of the duel between the Admiral and the
Commodore that two gunboats crept out from be-
hind the Cavité pier and started in to do desperate
deeds. One stole out along the shore, then turned and
made for the supply ships, while the other headed for
the “Olympia.” L L   S ’
The “Petrel” was sent after the ﬁrst, and after a
sharp bark or two from her four-pounders,the Spaniard
evidently gave up the job and made for the shore. The
“Petrel” made after her, and while the Spanish crew

smile ;

~>8698<*

clambered over their boat’s sides and on to the beach
and up into the underbrush, the “Petrel” turned her
rapid-ﬁre guns on their craft and literally blew her to
pieces.   t

The other torpedo boat, which was bound to destroy
our ﬂagship, made a better ﬁght. Our secondary bat-
tery was concentrated on her, but still she kept on

’ until within ﬁve hundred yards, and matters were

beginning to look serious for us. Then the machine
guns in the tops began to treat her to a hailstorm,
and this proved too much for this representative of

_ Spanish naval daring. She turned, and as shedid so

a shell struck her just inside the stern railing, exploded,
and the gunboat dipped suddenly in the middle; her
stern and bow rose as suddenly in the air, and she

  disappeared.

’ After passing ﬁve times in front of the enemy,
the men having been at their blazing work for two
uninterrupted hours, the Commodore concluded that it
would be well to call a halt. S

“ What time is it, Reese?” asked the Commodore.

“ Seven forty-ﬁve, sir.” ,

“Breakfast time,” said the Commodore with an odd
“ run up the signals for ‘ cease ﬁring’ andfollow
me.”  

With that the ‘_‘ Oly1npia’s ” bows were set for a run
to the eastern side of the bay Where the storeships lay.

As we swung out,"the Spaniards gave a cheer. They

draw, that the ﬁght was over. So, too, might the
Manila gunners on the Luneta fort have done, for as
we passed them they let ﬂy with their Krupp guns.

“ N 0 reply, I suppose, sir?!” said Lamberton, looking
meaningly over to the forward turret, while the men
at the ﬁve-inch guns were cocking their eyes inquisi-

tively up at the bridge.

“Oh, no,” said the Commodore; “let them amuse
themselves if they will. We shall have plenty of op-
portunity to burn powder. We have n’t begun ﬁght-
ing yet.” .

N o sooner had we reached the anchorage ground
beside the transport shipsthan the Commodore called
all the commanders on board to report. Then it was
that the wonder of it came to pass. ’

Not a ship disabled!

Not a gun out of order!

Not a man killed!

Not a man injured!

It seemed incredible that this should have been the
result to us in that awful two hours’ ﬁght,. while to the

Spaniards it had meant such destruction and desolation.
Captain after captain reported the same astounding
news to the Commodore.

The Commodore had decided on three hours’ rest,

and this being ample for all the preparatory work
needed, there was no hurry. First of all, all hands

were piped to‘ breakfast, and while I am not historian A
enough to have the details of every great combat at my

*>871B<*

pen’s point, it strikes me that this deliberate hauling
off and sitting down to breakfast in the middle of a
sea-ﬁght, stands as a situation unique in the chronicles
of maritime warfare.

The programme for the second act was that wewere
to ﬁnish up the enemy’s ﬂeet, taking one ship after
another, and then attend to the forts. Again we sailed
around to the Manila channel; and as we drew near
the Spaniards we saw that the “Cristina,” the “ Cas-

tilla,” and the transport “ Mindanao,” which latter had

been beached about midway between Cavité and Manila,
were all ablaze, and that their crews were busy as so
many ants trying to put out the ﬂames.

The condition of the Spanish ﬂagship was most piti-S

able, and before we had commenced ﬁring the second
time we saw Admiral Montojo transferring his ﬂag
from the “Cristina” to the “Isla de Cuba.” _
The “Baltimore” headed for the “Cristina” and
“Austria.” As she came within range she caught all
of the Spanish ﬁre that was left on board those two
ships. It seemed that in their desperation the Span-

10

iards ﬁred better at this time than they had in the I

earlier morning, for one of the foreigners’ shells ex-_

ploded on the “ Baltimore’s ” deck, wounding ﬁve men
with the splinters. No reply came from the “Balti-
more.”   T

A few minutes passed and anothershell landed on
the “ Baltimore’s ” decks, and three other men were hit.

Still the “Baltimore” did not reply. Shells plunged

15

20

25

+>8728<+

about her until she seemed ploughing through a park
of fountains. Then, when she reached about a three-

thousand-yard range, she swung and poured a broadside

into the “Reina Cristina.”  
The smoke clouds hid everything for a minute or

two, but when they lifted we saw the “Cristina” blow
-up, and the waters about her beaten with a rain of

descending fragments and men. When the rain of her
fragments had ceased the “ Cristina ” settled and sank,
the remainder of her crew jumping overboard and
swimming for the nearest consort.

The “Baltimore” then turned her attention to the
‘? Don Juan de Austria,” the “ Olympia” and “ Raleigh”
steaming up to complete the destruction in as mercifully
brief a time as possible. The three cruisers poured a
continuous stream of deadly steel into the Spaniard,
which rocked under the smashing.

The Spaniard replied as best she could, but in the
midst of it all there came a roar that drowned all pre-
vious noises. A shell had struck the Spaniards maga-
zine and exploded it. Up shot the “Austria’s ” decks in
the ﬂaming volcano, and so terriﬁc was the explosion
that the ﬂying fragments of the cruiser actually tore
away all the upper works of the gunboat which lay
beside her.

The cruisers “ Velasco ” and “ Castilla ” were thenext A

of the enemy’s ships to be wiped out. . .
Every ship in the Spanish ﬂeet, with one exception,

fought most valiantly, but to the “Don Antonio de p

*>8738<*

Ulloa” and her commander Robion should be given the
palm for that sort of desperate courage and spirit which
leads a man to die ﬁghting. Shot after shot struck the
Spaniard’s hull, until it was riddled like a sieve. Shell
after shell swept her upper decks, until under the awful
ﬁre all of her upper guns were useless ; but there was
no sign of surrender.
but the captain and his oﬂicers clung to their wreck.

The main deck crew escaped,  

On the lower deck her gun crews stuck to their posts p

like the heroes they Were.
As shot after shot struck the shivering hulk, and

_ still her lower guns answered back as best they could,

it seemed as though it were impossible to kill her. At
last we noticed that sickening, unmistakable lurch of a
sinking ship. Her commander noticed it too ; ' still
there was no surrender. He nailed the Spanish ensign
to what was left of the mast, and the “Don Antonio de
Ulloa” went down, not only with her colors ﬂying, but
also with her lower guns still roaring deﬁance. It was
a brave death, and I am sure every man in thesquad-
ron would like to have shaken Commander Robion by
the hand.

As the ﬁring grew faster and more furious, andthe
smoke settled down again, it was again almost impossi-
ble to distinguish exact and particular acts. Ship after
ship was sunk or burned, until poor old Admiral Mon-
tojo, seeing but the shattered and blackened remnants

10

15

20

of his ﬂeet, hauled down his colors and, together

‘:47’

ous roar, followed by a heart-shaking concussion.

-‘>874-8+

with the surviving Spaniards, hastily escaped from the
sinking and burning hulk, Admiral and oﬁicers alike

leaving behind them all their personal property and

valuables.
One after the other of the shore batteries was settled,
and then at 12.45 came the ﬁnal blow. The bastions

" of the Cavité forts had been crumbling under the shells

of the “Boston,” “Baltimore,” and “Concord,” While
the “Raleigh,” “ Olympia,” and “Petrel ” had been de-
voting themselves to the reduction of the arsenal.

-After half an l1our’s ﬁght of this sort the Cavité
gunners evidently became   demoralized and began ‘to
ﬁre Wildly. Those guns left in position continued ﬁr-
ing, however, until at their back there was a thunder-
A
shell had landed in the arsenal magazine. With the
upward rush of ﬂames, fragments, and dead, the heart
of the Spaniard went out of him, a white ﬂag was run
up at the Cavité citadel, and the battle of Manila was
over. ' A .

Again the commanders were called over to the ﬂag-
ship. Again came the reports: not a gun overthrown!
not a vessel disabled! not a man killed!

Are glowing in the mellow light.

A PERILOUS ADVENTURE.
2/'ICTOR HUGO.

VICTOR HUGO was born in France, on the 26th_of February,
1802. His father Was a general in the French army.

Hugo began to devote himself to literary work when he was
nineteen. The next year his volume of “Odes and Ballads”
Was published, and the king of France Was so pleased With the
verses that he conferred a pension of a thousand francs upon
the young poet. a

He then Wrote several. volumes of poems and romances, as Well‘
as a number of dramas, Which created great excitement among‘

the political parties of France. , ,

In 1837 he was made officer of the Legion of Honor and held
a number _of important positions during the next fourteen years.
His Writings and inﬂuence against Napoleon had created so
strong a feeling by that time that he was obliged to leave
France and take refuge in the Island of Guernsey.
remained, for nearly twenty years.

During.his exile he Wrote a number of books, among them
“ Les Miserables,” one of the greatest novels ever published. He
continued Writing throughout his life. i ,

Victor Hugo died on the 22d of May, 1885. His last years
were made happy by the love and admiration of his countrymen,
and his death was mourned throughout the nation.

THE old man satmotionless. For the moment it
seemed to him that in escaping from the sea, and in
touching land, all danger had vanished. No one knew
his name; he was alone, lost to the enemy, Without a
trace left behind him. He felt a strange composure.
A little more and he would have been asleep.

There he

Suddenly he started to his feet.

He was looking at the steeple of Cormeray, directly
in front of him beyond the plain.
dinary was taking place in this steeple.

/" The belfry appeared alternately open and closed at reg-

ular intervals ; its lofty. windows showed all white, then
all black ; the sky could be seen through it, then it dis-
appeared; a gleam of light would come, then an eclipse,
and the opening and shutting followed each other a
second apart,with the regularity of a hammer on an
anvil.

He lookedat all the steeples on the horizon. The

I belfries of all the steeples were alternately black and

white. What did this mean?
It meant that all the bells were ringing. ,
They were sounding the alarm, sounding it frantic-
ally, sounding it everywhere, in all the belfries, in every
parish, in every village, and not a sound reachedphis ears.
This was owing to the distance, which prevented

 the sounds from reaching so far, and because of the

sea breeze blowing from the opposite direction, which
carried all land noises far away from him. i

All these bells madly calling from every side, and at
the same time, silence; nothing could be more weird.

Certainly they were after somebody.

This man of steel shuddered. g

It could not be he. No one could have discovered

a his coming; he had just landed, and he ﬁnally assured

For some moments there had been a slight sound it
above and behind him. This sound was like the rust-
5 ling of a leaf on a wind-shaken tree. At ﬁrst he paid
N no heed to it; then, as the sound continued, he atlast
turned around. The Wind was trying to detach a large
placard pasted on the pillar above his head. ‘
G He mounted the stone on which he had been sitting,
10 and placed his hand on the corner of the placard which
Was ﬂapping in the Wind; a part of the placard Was
printed in large letters, and there was still “enough day-
light to read them. He read this : —— G v

The old man pulled down his hat over his eyes, drew
his cloak closely up under his chin, -and Went quickly
down the dune. It was evidently unsafe to remain

The plain was deserted. It_ Was an hour when
there were no passers-by. He stopped behind a
thicket, took off his cloak, turned the hairy side of
his vest out, fastened his ragged cloak around his
neck again by the cord, and started on his Way. I 5

“Where are you going?” said a voice.

_ He turned ‘around.  

A man was there in the thicket, tall like himself,

old like himself, with White hair like his own, and With

garments more ragged. Almost his double. This man 10 I

was leaning on a long stick. He repeated ; —
“ I ask where you are going.”
“In the ﬁrst place, Where am I?” he said with an

  almost haughty calmness.

The man replied :— V q 1 15
“You are in the province of Tanis. I am its beggar;

you are its lord.”

‘( I ?)7
“ Yes, you, sir, the Marquis de Lantenac.”

The Marquis de Lantenac——henceforth We shall call 2;) 

him by his name—replied gravely :—  
“You are right. Deliver me up.”
The man continued :—
"‘ We are both at home here: you in the castle, Iin
the thicket.”   25
“Make an end of it. Do your Work. Betray me,”

. said the Marquis.‘

The man pointed to the roof of the farmhouse, which
could be seen some distance away, above the trees.
