My dear Harriet-I cannot adequately express
the happiness I feel, in finding that my letter to
your respected parents has been crowned with
success, and I flatter myself, notwithstanding your
temporizing with my feelings, in thus reserving
your avowal of a reciprocal attachment, that you,
my dear girl, will not be unsusceptible to its value,
but condescend to acknowledge an equal happiness with myself at its contents. In token of the
confidence with which your dear letter has inspired me, I beg leave to present you with a trifle, the
acceptance of which will be highly flattering to
him whose image it pourtrays; and permit me
the fond pleasure of indulging a belief that my
lovely Harriet will esteem the trifle, in affectionate
remembrance of the original.
In obedience to your father's command, I shall
wait upon him at the appointed time; till then,
my beloved Harriet, adieu.
Ever your devoted admirer.

how swiftly I shall fly to embrace you-yes, my

My Dear Sarah--Since my arrival in Boston I
have been at times very unhappy, in being deprived
of the pleasure of your society, and frequently
pace over in my mind the agreeable walks we have
taken on your father's farm: believe me, my dear
girl, I would never have consented to so long a
separation, had it not been for the prospect of being enabled of affording you greater comforts in
our union, than I otherwise could have done; in
this I have not been altogether deceived, for should
Providence spare us for each other, I cherish the
hope of seeing you next summer, when I propose,
my dear Sarah, to celebrate our union; and I am
sure, it will give you as much pleasure as it does
myself, to inform you that I have realized sufficient
to start in a small way of business, or engage with
a small farm; but I think, my dear girl, as the
time draws nigh when I hope to see you, my
anxiety seems to increase; therefore write to me
immediately, as the possession and perusal of a
letter from you, will afford me a pleasurable relief
in my unoccupied moments.
I have sent you a few trifles, which I hope you
will value for my sake, and with my best wishes
and respects for your dear parents,
I remain, dearest Sarah,
Your faithful and affectionate.102     THE PARLOUR LETTER-WRITER.

My Dearest Joseph-Your kind and affectionate letter gave us much pleasure, especially as
you state that it is your intention to come down
next summer, and purpose settling here: I can assure you, we shall all be upon the tiptoe of expectation for your arrival, and father says it will be the
happiest day for him to give me away to my dearest Joseph; not to get rid of me, believe me, for
he is indeed a kind father, and loves me dearly;
but what delights him and my dear mother the
most, is, that you purpose settling in the country,
as in that case we shall not be deprived of seeing
each other, and they will be partakers of our joys
and pleasures, which could not be, had you made
up your mind to settle in Boston.
I have received your pretty little present, and
will repay you for your kind remembrance of me,
with a token more acceptable than money, when
I see you: until then, my dearest Joseph,
I remain, yours affectionately.

Sir--The receipt of your letter occasioned me
some surprise, especially as it treated on a subject
to which I had not yet devoted my thoughts;
neither did I imagine, from the general tenor of
your conduct towards me, that you entertained the
sentiment you have thus avowed.
With regard to your circumstances and your
family, I have no doubt but that your statements
are correct; and I shall now make a reply to the
proposal with which you have distinguiished me,
with that candour due to an honourable man on
such an occasion. I confess that your appearance
and behaviour were always agreeable to me, and
deserving of my respect; but, sir, I am under the
control of a guardian, upon whose kindness and
judgment I must implicitly rely, and without his
approbation I take no step of importance. Previously to my giving a decisive reply, I also wish
to know the sentiments of your mother; for, be104      TIIE PARLOUR LETTER-WRITER.

Madam-My warmest acknowledgments are
due in return for your kind letter. I am but too
happy that it remains in my power to give you
perfect satisfaction. My dear mother not only approves of my attachment to you, but her happiness
will be increased at beholding me the husband of
a young lady possessing so many excellent qualities. To convince you of this, she desired me to
send you the inclosed letter from her. I have now,
my dear madam, to solicit your permission to wait
upon you, when, I trust, I shall be enabled to enter into every necessary explanation, and to make
such arrangements as may prove agreeable.

Letter from the Gentleman's Mother.
May 8th, 18My dear Young Lady-You may probably
imagine, while perusing this letter, that the partial
affectiont of a mother induces me to praise too
highly a beloved son; but I can assure you, my
dear Miss, that no inducement will ever prevail
upon me to violate the sacred dictates of truth.
My son has made me acquainted with his love
for you, avowing that he could never be happyLOVE, COURTSHIP, AND MARRIAGE.  105
with another. This event has conferred no small
portion of genuine happiness upon me; first, because it is my most anxious wish to see himn settled
in life as the master of a family; secondly, because
I am too intimately acquainted with you both to
doubt that the result of your union must be happiness.
On my son's finishing his studies at the university, he kindly fixed his residence with me, anxiously devoting every moment of his life to the
promotion of my comfort and happiness. Nor have
I had a moment's reason to condemn his conduct.
This excellent behaviour, and the firm conviction
I feel that I am not much longer to be an inhabitant of this world, make me anxious for his happiness. Should you, therefore, condescend to have
him, I can only say it will perfect my happiness,
and I shall then close my eyes in peace. I must
also add, that void of all partiality, I do not conceive you could select for your partner a more
worthy character, or one so every way likely to
contribute to your happiness. I ground this bold
assertion on my knowledge of the solid virtues
with which he is endowed.
I shall conclude by assuring you, that whatever
your determination may be, I shall ever remain,
My dear Miss,
Yout very sincere friend.

had you done so, I trust I am disposed to make
every allowance for parental fondness.
I am satisfied, and as far as may relate to myself,
I can assure you, that your son will experience no
opposition; on the contrary, I shall feel myself honoured in being allied to so worthy a family. While
I lament, dear madam, your bodily sufferings, I am
almost tempted to envy you that pious resignation
with which you submit to them. However, we will
hope for the best, and trust when I have the honour
of calling you mother, that my tender attentions,
combined with those of your excellent son, will
contribute to renovate your health, and preserve
you many years as a blessing to us both.
I will thank you to present your son with the
inclosed, and with fervent prayers for your better
health believe me to be,

Dear Sir-I have to acknowledge the receipt of
your letter, and the one inclosed from your excellent mother. How happy ought you to be, in having such a parent!'I need scarcely add, that my
objections are now perfectly removed, as far as
depends upon myself; but you will please to remember that my guardian's consent is yet to be procured,
as without it I am resolved not to enter into so important an engagement as that of marriage, though
my happiness depends, equally with your own,
upon his giving a favourable reply. However, in
the course of a few days I design to return to hisLOVE, COURTSHIIP, AND MARRIAGE.  107

My beloved Jane-Ten thousand thanks are
most justly due to you for your affectionate letter.
It has elevated me to the extreme of happiness,
for I may now hope the remainder of my life will
be one continued scene of bliss. I rejoice, my dear
Jane, that your letter appears to have had a wonderful effect upon my beloved mother; it has given
her a fresh flow of health and spirits, her whole
conversation is now devoted to the praise of you,
my beloved. Need I add, that I never interrupt
her on a subject so truly congenial to my heart?
Indeed, I am apt to conclude, that I am more
highly blessed than ever man was before, in the
possession of such a mother and friend.
Keep me in suspense, my sweet girl, no longer
than necessary, as you may readily imagine how
anxious I must be to learn the decision of your
guardian. However, hope shall support me with
her benign smiles, till my beloved Jane herself
informs me of my future destiny. She will, I trust,
believe that words are infinitely too weak to convey
those sentiments I would fain express; but my
heart melts at the idea, and language fails. Adieu,
my beloved, adieu! may the all-beneficent Creator
guard and protect you, and speedily grant you to
the arms of
Your devoted, your affectionate.Advising the amount of the bankrupt's composition. 89

Dear Henry-Agreeablyto my promise, I hasten
to remove your anxiety. Immediately on my arrival here, I stated our mutual wishes to my guardian, who highly approves of our projected union,
and has authorized me to give you an immediate
invitation to his house, in order that everything
may be arranged without loss of time. Hasten
then, with your mother, to meet us, my dear Henry,
and be assured that you will be received in the
most welcome manner by my guardian, as well as

Your affectionate and faithful.

I   fly on the wings of love, my adored Jane, to

be my own for ever. Believe me, my life will be
but too short for me to prove my gratitude. Adieu!

Ever your own devoted.
From a Gentleman to a Widow.
March 7th, 18-.
Madam-Since our first introduction, I have no
longer been master of my own heart; your wit,
beauty, and numerous good qualities, have enslaved
it, and thus I offer it to your acceptance,LOVE, COURTSHIP, AND MARRIAGE.  109
I will not condescend to employ flattery, for
your own excellent understanding would condemn
it; neither will I attempt to draw any romantic
pictures of conjugal happiness; you are aware of
what may be expected from the marriage state,
from a man, I trust, of liberal ideas, and who is
tenderly devoted to you.
You have known me a sufficient time to be a
judge of my merits (if I possess any); I shall
therefore content myself with making you an offer
of my hand and heart, which I trust you will accept.
My circumstances, also, you are intimately acquainted with; it will, therefore, be needless for
me to enter upon them. Suffice it to say, I can
insure you every real comfort in life.
Anxiously waiting for a reply to this letter,
I remain, dear madam,
Your devoted lover.
A favourable Answer.
March 9th, 18--.
Sir-I confess, that from the whole line of coh.
duct for some time pursued by you, that I have
long expected that declaration which you have now
thought proper to distinguish me with, and which
I value the more highly from its plainness and
candour.
I certainly am aware what degree of happiness
we have a right to expect from the marriage state,
in which difficulties and enjoyments are closely
intermixed; though I am co6ifident that the latter
may easily be made to preponderate, by a proper
estimation of the faults and virtues of each party.
To the proposal you have made, I can have no110      TIIE P1ARLOUR LETTER-WRITER.
possible objection, because I respect your good
qualities; and in truth I must avow, that you have
long possessed my heart. You have, therefore, my
full consent to your wishes; and as to the arrangements of our union, I leave it entirely to yourself
to make them in such a manner as may be most
agreeable to you.
I am, dear sir,
Your affectionate friend.
An unfavos?uiable Answer.
March 9th, 18-.
Sir-I was, certainly, much surprised at receiving a proposal of marriage from you, because at an
early period of our acquaintance, perceiving your
attentions were of a particular nature, I invariably
treated you in such a manner as to check their future advance.
I can, therefore, only say iil reply, that I am
truly sorry you should have fixed your affections
upon a person who can never, unfortunately, return
them. I trust, therefore, you will earnestly endeavour to conquer a passion which must be hopeless.
I cannot dismiss this subject without returning
you my grateful thanks for the honour you have
done me, and at the same time assuring you, that
you will ever possess my faithful friendship.
I am, sir,
Your obedient servant.
Another Answer.
Sir-The very short time we have been acquainted, prevents my answering your letter in the deciLOVE, COURTSHIP, AND MAR.RIAGE.  111
sive manner your professions seem to desire. Having already trod the path of conjugal happiness, it
is a duty incumbent on me, not to mar my present
widowed comforts by any delusive engagement;
my former union having contributed to give me
more correct views of life, requires that, previous
to forming a second engagement, I should use a
more matured discretion than may be expected
from our sex in our tender years. Upon a better
acquaintance, our views may be more congenial;
until then, your regard for me will, I trust, spare
me a reconsideration of your proposal. With the
greatest respect for your kind attentions and esteem,
I remain, sir,
Yours most sincerely.

Dear Mary-Long before I was out of my apprenticeship, I had set my affections on you, and
resolved when I was out of my time, to disclose
my mind to you; you know that I am settled with
a good master, at thirty dollars per month, and so
long as I conduct myself as I have hitherto done,
there is little fear of my being out of employment;
this, my dear Mary, will be quite sufficient to make
us comfortable, especially under your frugal management. You will not then, I trust, be averse to
render me happy, by becoming mine; for were
you to refuse me, you would make me the most
miserable wretch on earth. Believe me, my love,
my whole wish is. to make you happy, and I feel
assured you must have some regard for me, from112      THE PARLOUR LETTER-WRITEtR.

July 12th, 18-.
Dear James-I have a long time suspected that
you had some thoughts of me, but had no idea you
would have been so hasty as to have made a proposal to me within a few months after being out
of your apprenticeship. With regard to becolning
yours, I cannot give -you a denial; but I think that
prudence requires some little delay, to realize those
comforts which you, as well as myself, I am sure,
would regret the want of; and I think they are
more likely to be obtained when single; and if
your love is as true as your profession, it will spur
you on to the attainment of them. I think, my
dear James, your own good sense will cause you
to judge as I do on this subject; and that the better provision we make, before entering upon a mode
of life, which, in all probability, mlay be productive
of a variety of expenses, however frugal we may
be, will be the most likely way to insure our own
happiness, and the approbation of our relations.
Trusting shortly to see you,
I remain, my dear James,
Yours most truly.

judge, therefore, from your own sentiments, how
miserable the order for my removal from you made
me. Driven almost to despair, I reprobated the
service, and would have given worlds to have resigned my commission, but it fortunately came
into my mind that I might still pour out the warm
feelings of my heart to you, my beloved, by means
of my pen; this soothed my grief,'and supported
me under our painful separation.
The amusements of this place afford no pleasure
to me, it being impossible for me to enjoy that in
which you do not partake: no, my beloved, my
only happiness consists in fancying scenes of.ideal
bliss which can never be accomplished till you are
mine for ever.

your house, the charms of your beloved daughter
made a great impression upon my heart, and the
many opportunities your hospitality gave me of
frequently meeting her, only bound me more firmly
her slave. But I could not resolve to acquaint you
with the state of my heart; the agitation of parting
from Julia, and the dread of incurring your displeasure, alone prevented this necessary explanation. However, while I candidly admit myself to
be undeserving of so vast a treasure, I am induced
to hope you will grant me the envied distinction I
solicit.
I have written to my parents, who are too anxious
to promote my happiness to throw any impediment
in the way of my wishes, with regard to an alliance with your family. Believe me, dear and respected sir, that I address this letter to you with
mingled feelings of fear and hope;-fear lest you
should, by rejecting my suit, consign me to misery;
and hope, under the flattering idea that you may,
perhaps, pity my situation, and condescend to make
me thehappiest of men, in the possession of your
lovely daughter.

dear Orlando, be assured that whether together or

happiness or misery in this world depends entirely
upon your conduct; my very existence being interwoven withi your well-being and general prosperity.
My father has directed me to transmit you the
inclosed. I have every reason to suppose it will
prove agreeable, though I can assure you I am
totally ignorant of its contents, and can only surmise them, by our last night's conversation, when
he hoped I should be as happy as he wished me.
I must acknowledge my pride is not a little
gratified at your statement, "that you can enjoy
no pleasures in which I do not share." It is an
avowal, dear Orlando, which thrills my hea3rt with

am ready to resign my dear girl to your protection; thus placing in your honour the greatest
confidence I can. With my most fervent prayers
for your mutual happiness,
am, dear sir,
Most affectionately yours.
From an Officer ordered Abroad.
August 1st, 18-.
My dearest Louisa--It is with a heavy heart I
address you, having received orders for instant
embarkation for the West Indies. The unwelcome
intelligence came like a thunderbolt upon me, as I
had been enjoying the fond hope that, in a few
days, you, my dear Louisa, would have been your
own George's for ever. All the imaginary scenes
of bliss which I had fondly prtmised myself, now
vanish like a mere delusion; and I am compelled
to exert my utmost fortitude to retain even a faint
hope of their realization; yet something buoys me
up with the pleasurable idea that I shall again see
you; and then, my dear Louisa, I trust that our
union will be celebrated, which will ever rivet me
to your beloved person. Were it not, my dear girl,
for the honour which demands my attention to the
call of absence, I would freely sacrifice all to you;
but considering that my absence may not be ofLOVE, COURTSHIP, AND MARRIAGE,.  117
any great duration, and should Providence protect
me through the hazardous enterprises of my profession, and spare me for my Louisa, the orders
which at present give me so much anxiety and
pain'may, ultimately prove beneficial to my honour
and interest, and a source of comfort to ius both.
Under this impression I embark, cheered with
the firmest reliance on my dear girl's constancy,
conscious that Louisa could never wound that
heart which loves her. Were you to prove unfaithful to vows so solemnly made, then I could
not live. Remember, therefore, my adored girl,
that in your hands is reposed my life. Believe me,
when I assert, that no part of my conduct shall
cause my Louisa to blush for her lover.
Cultivate, my charming friend, the friendship of
my excellent mother and sisters: it will yield an
additional pleasure to your devoted lover. I am
confident that, for my sake, as well as from your
personal merits, they will highly value your good
opinion. Farewell, my beloved! Wherever I am,
or whatever I do, my thoughts will be upon you.
Nothing can change the tender sincerity of my
heart, and I am proudly conscious that nothing
can deprive me of yours. I trust circumstances
will soon permit of my return; then, in leading
my Louisa to the altar, my happiness will be perfect, and I shall have no wish ungratified. Remember me. Farewell! I am, my beloved maid,
Your ever devoted lover.

I am scarce able to express my feelings at the
melancholy news; but in your own affectionate
heart you may readily imagine what I suffer.
If it be possible, my dear George, do procureleave of absence, if it be only for a few hours, that
I may take a farewell of him whom I may never
see again. The precarious chance of' life attendant
on your profession, fills me with the utmost anxiety,
and the thoughts of my George's suffering from
the fatal imnplements of destruction, thrills my
heart with horror; as yet, I have only been enabled
to picture to myself scenes of the most melancholy
nature, which, unless succeeded by some brighter
prospects, will certainly bereave me of my reason.
Depend upon it, my dear George, I shall cultivate
the friendship of your family; but as to affording
them any consolation, it will, I fear, be wholly out
of my power, as I stand in too much need of it myself. Perhaps it may mutually afford relief to sympathize in each other's feelings, for certainly every
expression of regard and feeling for the welfare of
him I love, consoles me in some degree, and elicits
a ray of hope that my forebodiings may bhe delusive.
I fear, my dear-George, you will think I have
been wholly regardless of your sensitive heart, in
pourtraying my feelings in a strain of such despondency; but be assured I will endeavour to
exert my fortitude, and hope for the best, sincerely
praying that Providence may protect you during
your absence--and with the most ardent wishes
for your health and prosperity,
I shall always continue,
Your own truly affectionate.LOVE, COURTSHIP, AND MAtRRIAGE.  119
From a Rich Gentleman to a Lady, with a Proposal of Marriage.
August 1st, 18-.
Madam--You will, perhaps, be surprised at receiving a letter from me; but as I have written it
with the most honourable motives, I trust I may
expect your pardon should the contents not be perfectly congenial to your views.
However, I have every reason to conclude that
in making you a proposal consistent with the passion I bear you, that I am not tresspassing on a
heart already bestowed on some favoured object.
I therefore flatter myself that I may not be altogether unsuccessful in arriving at the happy preference to which I ardently aspire.
My circumstances and station of life you are
fillly aware of, and I am happy to say that although
there may be a disparity in poinit of fortune, nevertheless the very amiable qualities of your heart,
and accomplishments of person, which have truly
riveted my affections on you, have made such an
impression on my family, that I can assure you,
it would afford them the higihest pleasure imaginable to reckon you in the number of their relations.
Having prefaced, my dear madam, thus far, permit me to entreat a favourable reception of my attentions; and believe me that your consent will
make me the happiest of my sex; on the contrary,
madam, a refusal will render me the most miserable of beings; and I feel confident that a heart so
truly amiable, will never give a moment's pain to
one who is truly fascinated with your charms, unless some fatal obstacle should exist, of which I
am wholly unconscious. Anxiously expecting an120       r:THEi PIARLOUR LETTERI-WRlTER.

which at present agitate a heart wholly yours,

Your sincere and affectionate admirer.
The Lady's Answer.
August 3d, 18-.
I am truly sensible of the honour you have conferred on me, by the proposal which your letter
contains, and can assure you I should be doing an
injustice to my own feelings, were I to express
sentiments in reply, otherwise than agreeable to
your professed wish; the main difficulty to a concession on my part, is fully and agreeably removed,
by the very flattering estimation in which you represent me to be held by your amiable and beloved
family; had not that been the case, it would have
been with much reluctance (supposing it to have
been possible) that you would have elicited a consent from me, as I am too well aware of the unhappiness which generally ensues, from the protracted scorn and contempt of haughty relatives,
where marriages are formed upon a disparity of
fortune. But as I feel convinced that the merits
of your family are not to be estimated by any ordinary standard, and that their most ardent wish is to
promote your comfort and happiness, believe me,
dear sir, I feel highly gratified at the honour of
being considered by them worthy of being elevated to the most prominent station, as a contributor
to it.
You will have the goodness to present my most
dutiful respects to them, and accept the sincere
and tender affection
Of your respectful
and honoured.LOVE, COURTSHIP, AND MARRIAGE.  121
The Gentleman's Reply.
August 4th, 18-.
My dearest Maria-Your agreeable letter has
afforded the highest gratification to my dear relatives, and the most lively emotions of love for the
heart that has consented to snake, me happy, in a
flow of such affectionate dignity. The compliment
you have been pleased to pay my relations, I most
sensibly feel; and be assured you will not be deceived in the impression you entertain of their
amiable qualities, when you have gratified the summit of my happiness, in becoming for ever my own
dear Maria.
My dear mother and sisters depart to-morrow
for Brighton, which will unavoidably interfere with
some of the pleasing arrangements I had formed
for our mutual pleasures; therefore, to give me
some consolation on that head, I must entreat your
conlsent to accompany them to that busy scene of
fashion, as your Edward has no alternative but to
accompany them. In granting me this most agreeable favour, you will, my dear girl, not only dispel
the peevish gloom which I am confident will hang
over me while deprived of your fascinating society,
but add a lustre to our glow of pleasure during our
stay at that healthy and lively coast.
I trust, therefore, you will permit my sister Julia
to wait on your amiable protectress, and obtain her
sanction for the desired recreation; in the mean
time, anticipating a favourable answer,
I remain,
Your affectionate lover.122       THE PARLOUR LETTER-WRITER,.

My dear Edward-It is truly gratifying to me
to find that an humble individual like myself,
should not only have had the opportunity, but the
agreeable pleasure, to aid the views of your dear
and respected mother, in promoting your wishes
and happiness, and especially so, since my fond
heart is a participator in the general joy. The
lively sentiments I expressed in respect to your
amniable family, which you have been pleased to
adorn with the appellation of compliments, were,
I can assure you, the genuine dictates of my heart,
and I think I can claim some little credit to truth,
since my unconstrained happiness for life has been
partly ventured on the fact.
You have requested, my dear Edward, that I
will consent to accompany your dear mother and
lovely sisters to Brighton; but what have you advanced in favour of this consent, which you require? not that they have expressed any wish on
the subject, but simply a polite request of your
own; and you conceive this to be an all-persuasive
allurement to obtain my society at Brighton. Indeed, my Edward, that is the only inducement
you have deigned to compliment me with; but,
lest your Maria should be so cruel as to elicit for
a moment " a peevish glooom," from the countenance unaccustomed to dejection, she will, in compassion to a lover's letter, believe all that was intended, and accept an invitation, which will be
highly gratifying to her feelings, especially as her
dear Edward will be of the party.
My dear Mrs. S-- particularly congratulates

much delighted at the pleasure I shall experience
in an excursion to Brighton; therefore, when my
dear Julia shall afford me the honour of a visit,
there will be no occasion for a display of her charming and persuasive eloquence to attain your wishes.
Returning your respected mother my sincere
thanks for the honour conferred, and begging you
to present my love to your dear sisters,
I remain,
Ever your affectionate.
The Gentleman's Reply.

My lovely Girl-The conclusion of your dear
letter has enchanted my very soul: to contemplate
the pleasures of Brighton in the society of the girl
I adore, almost persuades me that I have become
the object of delusion in some fairy scene; you
will, I am sure, pardon the apparent formality of
the terms I used in allusion to your generous feelings with regard to my family, and I am sure your
amiable heart will attribute the expression to its
true cause, which can only be accounted for by
your own dear self having wholly absorbed my
imagination; the same generous allowance, I
trust, will be made, for the absence of mind ex.
hibited in soliciting the pleasure of your accompanying us to Brighton; the formidable gaiety
you have displayed in so aclutely controverting my
apparent inattention to a chaste mode of invitation,
endears you the more (if possible) to my already
captivated soul. My dearest Maria, exhilarated

My dear Anne-Having commenced business
in town with every prospect of success, I feel myself enabled to make the proposal to you which I
have long sighed to possess the ability to do;
you have long known my intention towards you,
and I flatter myself, that the length of time which
has elasped since I had the pleasure of seeing you,
has not impaired the impression which I fondly
hoped I had made on your heart. With respect
to my own feelings, I can assure you, that they
are more alive than ever to your merits and
charms.
Let me entreat you, therefore, not to keep me
in suspense; but, by returning a favourable answer,

shall feel happy in uniting myself with you, you
need not doubt; the only regret I shall experience
in so doing, is, that of bidding"a'along adieu to my

and valuable friends; but being confident that my
dear George will fully repay the loss by his affectionate attentions to me, I shall cheerfully embrace the opportunity of accompanying him to

be made for so doing.

Sir-I duly appreciate the honour conferred on
me, in the sentiments of your letter, but am under
the necessity of informing you, that it is wholly
out of my power to accept your proffered attentions; my heart has long been engaged to another,
whose return to this country I am daily anxiously
expecting; your good sense will, therefore, dictate
the propriety of relinquishing any farther correspondence on a subject which can only give pain
to one, who has always held you in the highest estimation in the quality of a friend, trusting that
your fortitude will easily obliterate a passion unconsciously excited by me,
I remain, sir, with respect,

Sir-I am particularly surprised at the receipt
of a letter from you, upon a subject which nothing
but the most daring assurance could have dictated.
Setting aside the short period of our acquaintance,
and the disparity of our years, I should have conceived that a decent consideration for the late affliction I have sustained, in the loss of a dear and
affectionate partner, might have protected ime from
such a disagreeable intrusion. I can assure you,

Sir-Having never given you the slightest reason
to imagine that your attentions were agreeable to
me, I could not be otherwise than surprised at the
receipt of your letter, containing an avowal of love,
and the offer of your hand.
I am duly sensible of the compliment you have
thus paid to me, and shall feel pleasure in ranking
you among my most respected friends; more than
this I cannot do, my heart having long been the
property of another; and to him alone will my
hand be given.
Having made this candid declaration, I trust
you will banish from your bosom every trace of a
passion which can never be successful, and consequently be only productive of unhappiness to
yourself and friends, amongst the number of whomLOVE, COURTSHIP, AND MARRIAGE.   127

Dearest Mary-An order has just arrived for
our ship to sail immediately for the East Indies,
where it is probable we shall remain for three
years; but notwithstanding this, my dear girl, be
assured that neither time nor absence will make
any alteration in the affectionate heart of your
devoted sailor.  Keep up your spirits, then, my
dear, and fear not on account of your lover, for
"There's a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft,
To watch for the life of poor Jack."
And be assured that whatever may be our course,
you will be the pole towards which the needle of
my affections will constantly turn.
I have got my half of the sixpence which we
broke between us, and will preserve it as a sacred deposit; and should I fall among the glorious dead, it shall accompany me to my watery
grave.
Remember me, dearest Mary, and I trust that
Fortune with her smile will soon enable me to return with wealth and honour, to lay them at your
feet. May fair winds and a prosperous voyage attend you through life; and, in expectation of an

March 1st, 18-.
Madam-When in my youth I attached myself
to my late lamented wife, whose memory I cherish
with reverence, I imagined it would be impossible
ever to feel the impressions of love for another. In
this opinion, however, my judgment was founded
on error.
During the period of this lamented woman's life,
I was the happiest of men, my felicity being increased by the birth of three lovely children. And
when the moment of our separation arrived, I felt
genuine sorrow, resulting from the purity of my
love, and my irreparable loss.
Be not, therefore, surprised, when I avow that
my heart is devoted to you; and that the affection
I bore to that lovely saint, has taught me to appreciate those charms in which you perfectly resemble her. I have shown every respect to her
memory, and- shall ever fondly remember her.
From her I have learned the value of an amiable
wife, and would anxiously devote every hour of my
existence to promote the happiness of such a female.
You, madam, are the person on whom my afLOVE, COURTSHIP, AND MARRIAGE.   131
fections are placed. I am of a domestic turn of
mind, and I tenderly love my motherless children.
Will you, by accepting my hand, fill the duties of
that important station, and make their father once

Ever tenderly, yours.

Sir-I sincerely believe you are the only man
who ever ventured to profess love for a lady, by
the most affectionate praises of his first wife; but
be assured, sir, such tenderness towards a lovely,
deserving, and departed female, adds to my respect
for your character, by convincing me that your
professions are sincere, and that your heart is calculated to enjoy that pure happiness which results
from domestic indearments.
I am ready to admit, with that candour which
I trust is correct, that neither your person, character, nor manners, are disagreeable to me; on the
contrary, from the earliest period of our acquaintance, I have highly esteemed you.
Respecting your children, it would be with an
additional motive of attachment; and, I am confident, were I to take upon me the place of their
late invaluable motlher, that I should love them
equally with my own, and anxiously endeavour to
discharge my duties towards them, in such a manner, that the spirit of their departed mother (whom
I loved whilst living, and lament now dead,) might
look down from her blessed abode with approbation on my conduct.

Dearest Emma-Your charming letter has re..
moved a weighty load from my heart, and I may
now calculate upon the speedy enjoyment of every
possible happiness. Be assured I am truly sensible
of my great obligations to you and your worthy
brother, and that I shall never forget them, but endeavour, by every method in my power, to repay
at least some part of them.
After your affectionate invitation, you must not
expect that I shall delay my promised happiness;
you may, therefore, expect me on  next, when,
agreeably to your promise, I shall, my dearest Emma, claim your hand, under the conviction that I
possess your heart. May you never, my beloved,LOVE, COURTSHIP, AND MARRIAGE.   135
regret the confidence you thus repose in me, nor
repent the hour which allowed your affectionate
lover to avow himself the most happy of his sex
in being your husband.
I am, my beloved,
Yours, ever yours.

Lady.
April 11th, 18-.
Madam-From several circumstances which
have occurred, I feel assured that our marriage
would be only productive of mutual misery, especially as I with sorrow perceive that our dispositions are by no means alike.
Thus impressed, it is best to retreat in time. I
have, therefore, to state, that I beg permission to
decline all future intercourse of a tender nature.
I am, madanm,
Your obedient servant.
From a Gentleman to a Lady.
January 11th, 18-.
Madamn-from the length of our intimacy, you
must have discovered that my heart is devoted to
you. I have constantly endeavoured, by every attention in my power, to prove the tenderness with
which your numerous charms have inspired me.
I have flattered myself that I am not disagreeable to you, and that I might expect a mutual degree of attachment from you. Say then, madam,
may I venture to make you an offer of my handxny heart you have long entirely possessed. You136      TIE, PAtLOUR LETTER-WRI'TER.
are intimately acquainted with my circumstances
and disposition. To this I can only add, that my
happiness or misery through life depends altogether
on the reply you mlake to this offer. I shall employ no compliments, neither shall I insult your
good sense by idle promises; but should you accept me as your protector through life, all my
anxiety will be how to promote your happiness,
and at the same time to retain possession of your
heart, for which I shall be amply repaid in seeing
that you are gratified with my conduct. On the
contrary, should you reject my offer, I shall never
again enjoy true peace of mind; yet, I trust, even
int that case, that you will be happy with the man
whom you may bless with your hand, and that you
will honour with your friendship
Your very affectionate,
faithful friend.
The Answer.
January 14th, 18-.
Sir-I reply to your letter with the utmost candour, as I conceive the more explicit our sentiments upon a subject which involves many, and
oftentimes serious, passions and jiuquietudes, the
better. That I am not unmindful of your worth,
I frankly own, and judge that there can be no impropriety in admitting your attentions as a suitor.
But with regard to the success of the enterprise
in which you have engaged, that must wholly result from a continuation of the feelings with which
my present notions of your merits has impressed me.
As I have not yet fallen into the bewitching dilemma of absolute captivation, I shall hold you in
the ordeal of probation, till I am enabled, withLOVE, COURTSIIIP, AND MARRIAGE.  137

which depends my own freedom and happiness.

do not consider it by any means proper for young
females to receive presents from gentlemen, even
though under a mutual engagement. It is upon
this principle only that I refuse your gift. Reserve,
therefore, such testimonials of affection till I become your happy wife; then, indeed, I shall receive them with rapture from the hand of a beloved

From a Gentleman to a Lady greatly his Superior
in Rank and Fobrtzune.
July 6th, 18.Madam-I have no excuse to offer for my presumption in addressing this letter to a lady so
greatly my superior, except my ardent love and
admiration, which will be sufficient, I hope, to
plead my pardon, and to procure me your pity.
I have long tenderly loved you with the utmost
fondness, but, till this moment, could never resolve
to make a disclosure of my passion, on account of
the inequality of our situations.
Say then, madam, will you permit me to make
you an offer of my hand and heart?  Will you
suffer me to indulge the pleasing expectation of
receiving from you a return of mutual love?
I c;n only add, that I am dub,ly sensible of my
temerity, but should you condescend to a ~cept my
proposal, and by uniting your destiny with mine,
make me the happiest of men, then shall my life
be devoted to the constant promotion of your happiness.
I am, dear madam,
Ever yours.LOVE, COURTSIIIP, AND MARRIAGE.  139
The Answer.
July 7th, 18-.
Sir-As from the whole tenor of your conduct,
I have long flattered myself with the possession of
your heart, I will confess that I was not much surprised at the receipt of your letter.
Believe me, sir, I consider the mere distinction
arising from birth or wealth, as idle things. With
this impression upon my mind, I feel no hesitation
in avowing that I have long loved you with a mutual warmth of affection. Consequently, I can offer
no objection to the proposal you have honoured me
with; and I consider myself highly distinguished
in being selected by you as the female worthy of
becoming your wife.
Having made this confession, I shall not endeavour to restrain your happiness by any false affectation of reserve, but content myself with stating
that I am ready to become your wife; for which
purpose I leave the necessary arrangements to you.
I am, dear sir,
Yours faithfully.

Sir-I certainly was considerably surprised at
the ieceipt of your letter, containing an offer of

the presumption to hope for a return of love from a
person so greatly your superior as I am.

has, to my eternal sorrow, dispelled my pleasing
error. Be it so: I will endeavour to submit to my
cruel fate; and, unless I experience a different
mode of treatmernt, I must (however painful it may
be) bid you
Farewell for ever.
The Lady's Answer.
September 11th, 18-.
Dear John-Perhaps some excuse may be made
for your cruel letter, arising from the violence of
an unbounded passion. I am, therefore, ready to
forgive your unmerited censures, but only on condition of their being never repeated.
Should you, therefore, be at leisure to call upon
me this evening, I doubt not but that every part
of my conduct. can be explained to your satisfaction.

Sir-After the decided disapprobation I have
constantly evinced to your attentions, I was rather
surprised at receiving an offer of marriage from
you.
I am sorry that you have thus placed me under
the disagreeable necessity of speaking on a subject
so repugnant to my feelings; but candour and
truth compel me to return an instant aud positive
negative to your proposal.
I trust, therefore, you will no longer persist in
disturbing, by such unavailing efforts, the peace

July 10th, 18-.
Dear Sir-Unfortunate circumstances have suddenly reduced me from a state of respectability and
comfort, to, I have every reason to fear, absolute
want and mnisery; and what adds more severely to
the poignancy of my feelings, is, that I cannot surmise a hope that I shall ever be relieved from its
awfull pressure.

Thus circumstanced, I should not be acting honourably, were I not to return, herewith, the article
I purchased from you under the expectation of being enabled to pay for it in a few days; but so
isolated am I from every prospect of so doing, that
I even dread the want of ability to procure a bare
subsistence for myself and family. Even this extremity of misfortune, however, cannot induce me
to commit an unjust act towards one.who has reposed confidence in me.
I beg leave to assure you how highly sensible I
am of your good intentions towards me; and I
trust, notwitlistanding my present distress, you
will still *honour me with your correspondence, as
it affords me great consolation in my present struggles and affliction, to find that I am not wholly

My dear Father--My worthy master has directed me to write to you, requesting you to transmit
me the books named in the margin, as I have been
advanced into another class, having passed the necessary examination, nmuch to my credit, as Dr.
Jackson, our examiner, was pleased to state.
I have already commenced reading Virgil and
Livy; and, in arithmetic, as far as vulgar fractions. I am certain this news will give you much
pleasure, and I trust I shall always obtain your
praise for my attention to my studies and improvement, as it is the only recompense I can give you
for your unwearied exertions for my benefit.
Hoping to hear from you shortly, I am, my dear

Sir-I have sincerely to apologize to you for not
returning according to my promise, but having
met with a gentleman who has just returned from
Italy, I was induced to make some inquiries concerning his route and adventures, when, to my
surprise, I found that he had been intimately acquainted with my son, who, you are aware, has
been, for some time, studying painting in that fertile region of the arts.
Allured by his conversation, and particularly
with his relation of several agreeable adventures
he had had, in company with my son, the hours
glided away so imperceptibly, that it was midnight

Sir-The promise I made you of spending last
evening with your amiable family, totally escaped

As I was on my way down Market street, I observed a respectably-dressed female basely assaulted by a fellow, who, upon being remonstrated with,
llhad the audacious insolence to give her in charge
of the watch, as being the party aggrieved;'tis
true, at the moment I concluded her to be one of
those unfortunates who are but too much experienced in scenes of this nature; but filled with indignation at such an unmanly action, and forget.
ful of my engagement, I resolutely remonstrated
against the official activity of the watchman, in
dragging off an unoffending victim to the cage,
doubtless, for the purpose of extorting money, when
lo! I found myself a prisoner, and about to be as
abruptly accommodated with a lodging as the unfortunate lady. On our arrival at this mighty seat
of judgment, I witnessed the most vile charge of
assault with intent to commit a robbery, made
with the most barefaced effrontery that can be
imagined, and your humble servant charged as an
aider and abettor in this said crime; fortunately,
among the auditory at this tribunal I recognized

turned, from the greatest pomposity and wilful
deafness to truth, to an assiduous attention to commit the actual aggressor, right or wrong, which
was instantly effected; but judge of my surprise,
when I discovered that this unoffending female
was no less a personage than our worthy friend,
Mrs. Jenkins, who was just stepping into Sixth
street, to obtain a coach, having missed the Lancaster stage by. a few minutes. You may be assured, after the alarm and fright which she had
experienced, I accomlpanied her home, and accepted a bed from our mutual friend. Fearing that I

From a Gentleman to his Son, whose Conduct displeased him.
Jlly 12th, 18-.
William-I am truly grieved to find that all
my remonstrances have been thrown away upon
you, and that the advice I have given to you, which
originated solely from the tender affection I bear
towards you, continues to be treated with contempt.
It therefore becomes my solemn though melancholy
duty, to act with determination. I am resolved to
do so, and no entreaties shall prevent me fiom resorting to every mode of punishment remaining in
ny power, unless you make an immediate refbrmation in your conduct.
In pursuance of this plan, I have given.my agents
a positive order never to advance you a single shilling on my account; and when your money is
gone, young man, you will also then discover
your real friends, though I greatly fear you have
not one in the universe, with the exception of
your injured and insulted father, who is yet even
anxious to save you from utter destruction. I have
only to add, that should you still continue to persist in your present debauched. line of conduct, I
will for ever close my doors against you, and never
exchange either a letter or syllable with you whilst
I live.
Think, young man, I most earnestly conjure
you, upon what I have said, before it is too late,
and fly to the arms of your afflicted father, while
they are yet extended to receive you.
I remain, your well-wisher.

Thle Answer.
July 14th, 18-.
Sir-For I dare not' address you by the tender
appellation of father, my cheeks burn with shlame
and sorrow whilst I am writing to you.  Your
justly merited and truly severe letter, though blended with parental mercy, has at length opened my
eyes to a proper view of the enormlity of' my conduct, and the amazing ingratitulde I have exhibited towards you, one of the best of parents. Indeed, sir, I can hardly believe that your tender
affection for your unworthy son, can ever induce
you cordially to pardon so depraved a creature
as I am.
Believe me, sir, I am sensible of my past folly,
of my unkind treatment of yourself, and of your
undeserved affection.  Pardon me what I hap
done, and be assured that, from this moment, I
will for ever quit those evil debauched paths in
which I too long unfortunately strayed; and, by
the constant propriety of my future behaviour, endeavour to deserve your proffered clemency, and
to regain that portion of your love which I certainly deserve to lose for ever.
You tell me, sir, that your arms are still open
to receive me; I shall fly to them with the hope
that, when your guilty, though penitent, son is
folded to your heart, you will then seal his pardon for the past, and again permit him to call you
his dear, his beloved father.
I am, sir,
Your unhappy, though repentant, son.

you in this world, I now join to the trifles I leave
you these few lines, and which I beg of you often
to read for his sake, who ever loved you so tenderly. Above all thing, fear God as the Supreme
Author of all good; love him in your soul, and
be religious; but detest every tincture of hypocrisy.
Regard your neighbour, that is, all mankind,
and of whatever nation, profession, or faith, while
they are honest, and be ever so thyself; it is the
best policy in the end, depend upon it.
Guard against idleness; it is the root of every
misery, to which bad company gives the finishing
stroke.
Love economy without avarice, and be ever thyself thy best friend.
Fly from the excesses of debauchery; they will
rot thy body, while they are a canker in thy
mind. To keep both sould, my dear, be never
behindhand with thy correspondent, with thy
creditor, with thy daily occupations, or with thy
conscience, and thy soul shall enjoy peace.
By using air, exercise, diet, and recreation, thy
body shall possess health and vigour.
Dear John, should fortune frown, which, depend
upon it, sometimes she will, then look round on
thousands more wretched than thyself, and who,
perhaps, did less deserve to be so, and be content.
Content is better than fine gold.
Wish not for death, it is a sin; but scorn to fear
it, and be prepared to meet it every hour, since
come it must, while the good smiles at its sting
and defies its point. Beware of passion and cruelty; but rejoice in being-good natured, not only to
man, but to the meanest insect; that is, to the
whole creation without exception; detest to hurt153      TIHE PAiRLOU  LE'rTEER-WRITlER.
them but for thy food or thy defence. To be cruel
is the portion of the cowarad, while bravery and
humanity go hand-in-hand, and please God.
Obey with temper, and even pleasure, those set
over thee; since, wvithout knowing how to be obedient, none know how to command.
Now, my dear boy, love Mrs. Stedman and her
little children, from your heart, if ever you had a
real love for your dear father, who requests it of
you. She has most tenderly proved a help in thy
infant state; and while thou art a brother to her
helpless little ones, prove thyself, also, a parent and
a guardian, by constant kindness, and a proper
conduct. Let that good sense with which heaven
has been pleased to befriend thee, ever promote
peace and harmony in my dear family; then shall
the blessing of Almighty God overspread you and
them, and we, together with your beloved mother,
my dear Johanna, have a chance once more to
meet where, in the presence of our heavenly Benefactor, our joy and happiness shall be eternal and
complete; which is the ardent wish, the sincere
prayer, and only hope of your once-loving father,
thy tender parent, who, my dear child, when you
read this, shall be no more, and rest with an affectionate heart to all eternity.
Yours, &amp;c.

moderation, and trust that I am happy.

consequently, that you were disappointed of a situation on board that ship. I trust, however, it will
not be long before something else, equally desirable, will be procured for you. The education you
have received qualifies you to make yourself useful
in most situations, and I am inclined to think your
not going to Cambridge may prove an advantage
to you.
The expenses of an university education are
now become so very great, and there is so little
chance of obtaining employinent without very powerful interest, that I think your friends have done
very wisely in sending you out into the world, and
letting you seek your fbrtune by your own exertions.
Should it please God to preserve your life, your
success will, under the Divine Providence, in a
great measure, depend upon your own good conduct; and you may, if you behave i.n the manner
I flatter myself you will, look forward to the time
when it will be in your power to act as a father to
your little brothers and sisters, and to return to
your parents those numberless obligations they
have conferred upon you; nothing, I am sure,
would give you greater satisfaction.
Should any opportunity occur in which I can
be of service to you, I shall embrace it with pleasure.

live independent of any employment, I cannot reconcile myself to be idle; I shall, therefore, feel
myself particularly obliged, if you can procure me
a commission in your regiment, being anxious to
enter on a military line of' life. Trusting that you
will excuse this application, and favour me with
atn early answer,
I am, dear sir,
Your obedient and obliged servant.

My young Friend-I have to-day been favoured
with your letter, and I would most willingly comply with your request, had I not at this moment
my regiment quite full of officers, and several young
gentlemen on my list, ready to receive such commissions as may chance to fall vacant during the
spring
I am, sir,
Yours very truly.
Another Answer.
October 14th, 18-.
My dear Sir-I hasten to answer the letter with
which you favoured me, and dm truly happy that
it is in my power to comply with your request, a
lieutenancy being now vacant in the regiment I
have the honour to command, for which you shall,
in a few days, receive a commission.
I am, dear sir,
Yours truly.
From a Gentleman to his Friend, after an unfortunate diference with another.
December 5th, 18-.
Dear Sir-I should have done myself the pleasure of replying to your polite letter yesterday, to
thank you for your ready compliance with my request, but have been so much engaged with company coming unawares upon me, that I was unable to do so sooner. I regret equally with yourselfFRIENDS AND RELATIVES.
the fracas that has taken place, particularly situated as the person you allude to and myself have
been, which ought to have rendered such an occurrence impossible. I feel much obliged by your
kind attention, but, as you reside in the same house
with the person above mentioned, I lament to say,
I do not at present see any prospect of our meeting, except by accident.
I am, dear sir,
Yours, most faithfully.
From a. Gentleman abroad, to his Wife in Philadelphia.
May 2d, 18-.
My beloved Jane-Ever anxious to correspond
with you, the beloved of my soul, I most pleasurably embrace an opportunity which now presents
itself of sending you a letter.
Every thing goes on with me as agreeably and
prosperous as I can reasonably expect; the only
trouble I have is that of being absent from you,
whose charming society and tender endearments
neither time nor possession can render me willing
to relinquish even for one moment. No, my dear
wife, believe me, each year which has elapsed since
the solemn rites of religion consecrated us to each
other, has only contributed to render me still more
sensible of the treasure I then gained, and of my
own exquisite happiness in having such a friend,
and such a wife, for whom nothing can ever diminish the ardency of my love.
A few months, I trust, will restore me to your
dear arn.ms, never again to be torn from them, having nearly completed the arrangement necessary

to be made respecting my property in thi~ distant
part of the world, You may be assured, the fond
idea of again seeing you, urges me to use all possible expedition in the transaction of business.
Be careful, my beloved, of your health; remember your Henry's life and happiness depend on
yours, with which it is too closely connected to
admit of any separation. Render my kindest remembrance to all our mutual friends, and preserve
the imnage of him who adores you, in your heart.
I am, my dear Jane,
Your affectionate and faithful husband.
The Answer.
May 31st, 18-.
My dear Henry-To receive a letter from you,
ever conveyed the purest feelings of unaffected
happiness to my bosom, even when only separated
for a single day; you may, therlefore, easily imagine how gratified I was to hear from you, when,
for the first time since cur happy union, we are so
widely apart.
Believe me, my eienry, that during the period
of your absence, I cannot partake of any real enjoyment, because all I do is alloyed by the knowledge that my heart's beloved cannot enjoy it with
me.
My whole employment is now to look forward
to that happy hour whein we shall be reunited, in
doing which I draw the most delightful scenes of
future bliss.
Indeed, my affectionate, my dear husband, I can
never sufficiently express, even by the utmost tenderness, the high and grateful sense I entertain of
your unwearied kindness and constant love to me.FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.
Were I to live an age, and each moment of my
life devoted to your service, it would not suffice.
I sincerely hope, that your business will soon permit you to return to the affectionate arms of your
anxious wife; for I feel perfectly assured, that nothing but the most urgent business will possess the
power of detaining you one moment from the society of her who lives but in your presence, and
whose heaven is the enjoyment of your smiles.
The kind caution you give me of being careful
of my health, I must retort upon you. For my
beloved Henry, were I to lose you, Death, by taking
me, would prevent you from reposing in a solitary
grave. No, my dearest husband, it would not be
possible for me to survive your loss. With affectionate blessings,
I am, my dear husband,
Your own devoted wife.
From a Brother to his Sister at Boarding School.
October 12th, 18-.
My dear Louisa-I embrace an opportunity
which presents itself, of sending you a letter, free
of expense, fearing you would otherwise imagine
that I had forgotten you.
I am truly rejoiced to learn from our dear father,
that you are rapidly improving; continue to do so,
my beloved girl, as it will evince your own merits,
and likewise prove to our dear parents how truly
anxious you are to please them; independent of
which, you will discover, hereafter, that your pre.
sent acquirements will command for you the respect and love of all-an ample reward for your
present labours. I have sent you, my dear girl, as

The Sister's Answer.
October 15th, 18--.
My dear Brother-I have to acknowledge the
receipt of your affectionate letter, and to return
you my warmest thanks for your kind present.
I hope you will always find that I pay a proper
degree of respect to the advice you are so frequently good enough to give me, and that my
conduct will evidence the truth of' this assertion.
For, believe me, I shall always feel truly gratified
in having melited the good opinion of' my dear
brother.
With respect to my improvement, I flatter myself neither my beloved parents, nor yourself, will
have any great reason to find fault; at least I am
happy to say that my dear and respected governess
gives me full credit for as much improvement as
she can expect.
Make my dutiful remembrances to our excellent
parents, and my affectionate regards to your dear
wife and children. With the hope that you will
shortly favour me with another letter, I subscribe
myself,

From a Gentleman to his Friend, containing an
Invitation.
July 2d, 18-.
My dear Friend-Being now settled at my country residence for the summer, I lose no time in soliciting the pleasure of your company, together
with that of your family, and trust that you will
make it convenient to pass a month or six weeks
with us in our rural retirement. I believe that you
are too well aware of my friendship, to doubt every
thing will be done to render your stay with us
agreeable.
My wife desires me to inform you, that unless
you comply with this our mutual request, your
name will be erased from her good books.
Pray favour us with an early answer, and let it
be such as we expect.
With best wishes to yourself and family, believe me to be, my dear sir,
Very faithfully, yours.
The Answer, accepting the Invitation.
July 4th, 18-.
My dear Sir-Your very friendly and polite invitation demands my immediate attention. You
may be assured, that I never willingly resign the
pleasure of enjoying your society; and, on the
present occasion, I am extremely happy to say,
that I have nothing to prevent my acceptation of
your very kind offer. You may, therefore, expect
me and my family in the course of ten days. I
hope we shall be able to prevail on you and your
good lady to return with us.
Requesting you to be assured, that I am truly
sensible of your repeated acts of friendly attention160      THE PARIOUR LETTE,fl-W,RITER,
towards me, I am, dear sir, with best wishes for
your health and happiness (in which my wife
unites) very affectionately,
Yours truly.
Another- Answer, containing an Excuse.
July 5th, 18-.
My worthy Friend-I am truly obliged to you
for your very friendly invitation, and sincerely
lament that the pressure of my business prevents
me at present from complying with it; though I
hope this will not induce your amiable lady to
erase my name from her good books, especially as
it is no fault of mine, my inclination being decidedly in favour of the visit. I shall, however,
embrace the earliest opportunityof passing a week
with you, when the hurry of business is a little
got over; when, I trust, my welcome will not be
the less cordial for the present delay.
My family unite with me in the kindest remembrances to you all; and I subscribe myself, dear
sir, with great truth,
Your obliged friend and humble servant.
From a Gentleman to his Friend, requesting his
Influence in procuring a Situation for his Son.
February 9th, 18-.
My dear Sir-T'he friendly intercourse which
has so long subsisted between us, induces me to
knake an application to you respecting my son,
who has also the honour of your acquaintance. I
do this the more readily, from never having previously trespassed upon your kindness, and, according to all human probability, I shall never
again have to tax your friendship,FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.
Fortune has thrown us into very different spheres
of life; to you she has given wealth and influence,
whilst on me she has bestowed a small business in
a country town, just sufficient to support the character of a gentleman, and to educate my child in
a decent manner, but not to lay by a fortune for
him. Thus circumstanced, as he is now arrived
at years of maturity, I trust you will excuse my
natural wish to provide for him before I depart
from this transitory vale of existence.
T William is desirous to procure a clerkship in
some compting room, from its presenting the most
pleasing prospect of speedy advancement.
Will you, therefore, my dear sir, exert your interest upon this occasion in favour of my only son,
who, in my candid opinion, is every way calculated
to fill the situation he desires, and who, without
your assistance, can never hope to attain it. Resting the event totally upon you, and not in the least
doubting your friendship, whatever the event may
be, I shall ever remain,
Your very faithful
and obliged friend.
The Answer.
February 12th, 18-.
My dear Sir-I was favoured with your letter
yesterday, and to remove all anxiety from your
mind, I hasten to answer it.
I trust I need not make any professions of friendship to one so intimately acquainted with me as
yourself, towards whom I bear the warmest esteem
and respect. Be assured, my worthy friend, I shall
feel the highest degree of pleasure in being able to
11
161162      TIIE PARLOUR LETTER-WVRITER.
serve you, or in any manner to promote your in
terests.
Your son's merits would have induced me to
serve him, independent of my regard for his father;
and I am truly happy to say, that I have no doubt
but that his wishes will be gratified.
In a few days, I expect to have the pleasure of
transmitting your son his appointment, and I beg
you will present him with the inclosed bill, as a
present from his godfather, to assist him in fitting
out.
With best wishes to yourself, your amiable wifb
and family, believe me, my dear friend, to be ever
most faithfully and affectionately,
Yours.
From a Gentleman, congratulating his Friend on
his Marriage with an amiable Young Lady.
February 28th, 18-.
My dear Friend-I trust you will devote a few
moments from the pleasures with which you are
now surrounded, to the perusal of an epistle from
an old and faithful friend, conveying his hearty
congratulations on your marriage. May you, my
dearest friend, and your charming bride, live many
years to enjoy that genuine felicity attendant on
the conjugal state, when it is entered upon from
proper motives. May you live to experience a numerous offspring blooming around you, by whose
virtues the evening of your days shall be rendered
equally happy with the present joyous period.
Adieu, my valued friend; make my best wishes
acceptable to Mrs. B, and be assured no person rejoices more fervently at your present happiness, than your
Very faithful and affectionate friend.FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.
From a TVidow Lady to a Female Relation, in behalf of her Daughters.
November 25th, 18--
My dear Madam-I doubt not but that you have,
ere this, been informed of the severe and irrepara
ble loss I have experienced in the death of my beloved husband, with whom I can truly say that I
have passed thirty years of uninterrupted happiness. My only remaining consolation is, that I
shlall (at no distant period, I trust) rejoin his blessed spirit in a better world, and the possession of
two lovely young women, tile dear and affectionate
pledges of our mutual love. It is principally on
their account, my dear madam, that I now address
you, my beloved husband not having left sufficient
beliind hini to provide for them in the manner I
could desire. May I therefore venture to recommend them to your notice, whenever the period of
my dissolution arrives? Will you, in that case, become a mother to those young anlld beloved females,
who will then be cast upon the world without parents, without friends, and destitute of experience,
with barely enough to shield them from the severity
of want? This will, at an early period, be their
unhappy destiny, unless yomu will humanely interpose your liind protection; for the unexpected death
of my husband has so completely destroyed rny
constitution, that I feel convinced my course in
this world draws swiftly towards its termination.
Anxious for my daughters' prosperity, I have ventured to make this application, pleading as my only
excuse for so doing, the strength of maternal love.
I am, dear madam,
Very affectionately, yours.

The Answoer.
November 30th, 18--.
My dear Cousin-I received your affectionate
letter, and, till I read it, was totally ignorant of
the heavy loss you have sustained. Any attempt
to console you at present, I am aware, must be in
vain; I shall therefore hasten to reply to the contents of your letter.
Suffer no apprehensions respecting your beloved
girls to prey upon your spirits, as you may rely
upon my being a mother to them during my life,
and at my decease they shall be amply provided for.
In consequence of this, I have to request you
will lose no time in taking up your residence with
me, together with my young relatives; and, that
the journey may not be too expensive, I have inclosed you herewith a bank bill, which I beg you
will devote to that purpose, and the settlement of
your affairs.
I trust my efforts, combined with the tender attentions of your amiable daughters, will preserve
you to us for many years, and that you will yet
survive to embrace a lovely race of grand-children.
Hope for the best, my dear madam. Put your
trust in an all-gracious Providence, and believe me
to be, with fervent prayers for your happiness,
Very tenderly, yours.
Another Answer.
November 30th, 18-.
Madam-With every desire to comply with your
request, I am compelled to give it a negative. My
circumstances (though generally supposed affluent)
not being such as to warrant my giving a prolnise
of the nature you require.FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.
I would, therefore, recommend you to place
your daughters out to some line of business, in
which, by industrious exertion, they may earn a
subsistence; not that I wish to dictate. Should
you, however, do so, I shall have no objection to
assist you with a small sum for that purpose.
I am, madam,
Your humble servant.
Reply to a letter, begging a faeour, in the negative.
October 20th, 18--.
Dear Sir-Doubtless you have ere this thought
and spoke of me very harshly, because you have
not received the answer to your letter you might
possibly have anticipated; I should have written
before, but I have not had an opportunity. The
favour you require of me, cannot, I think, afford
you that assistance you speculate upon; consider
that what you propose is an undertaking of some
magnitude, and how it is possible for you to succeed with such slender assistance, I cannot possibly imagine; in fact, the means and plan do not
appear consistent. I must therefore decline, as I
see no probability of bettering your situation by it;
for it follows, as a natural consequence, that before you could duly apply it, in order to reap a
lasting benefit, the sum must be gone to satisfy
certain necessitous demands. I hope you will forgive me for writing this letter, so ill adapted to
youri vsews, and remain,
Dear sir
Yours obediently.
165166     TIIF PARLOUgR LETrER-WRITER.
From a Poor Man to his Daughter, just entered
into service.
October 17th, 18-.
My dear Mary-Having now commenced the
arduous undertaking of procuring a livelihood for
yourself, by your own industrious exertions, I cannot better discharge my duty than by giving you
such humble advice as I am competent to.
In the first place, carefully avoid all symptoms
of impatience, which will invariably make your
employers enemies; to do this, remember that it
is your duty to submit to your employers, however
harsh their commands may appear.
Be strictly attentive to cleanliness and industry,
otherwise you will never preserve any place long,
which alone will be sufficient to ruin your character.
Keep as much as possible at home, as when a
servant ranges abroad it invariably produces anger from her mistress, exclusive of which, it renders her discontented with that station which it
has pleased the Almighty Disposer of all things to
allot to her.
Endeavour, by the most scrupulous attention
and willing alacrity, to prevent even the wishes of
your employers. This-wvill insure you their love
and protection; a constant desire to please, being
always sure of success.
Should there be any children in the family you
may serve, treat them with the greatest tenderness,
and with proper respect, for it may so happen, that
in the course of life those very children may become your employers.
If there are male servants in the family, treat
them with attentive kindness, but on no account
suffer them to take any improper liberties.FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.
Above all, be honest. It is a solemn duty you
owe to those who intrust you with their property;
and remember, that you will be equally culpable
in defrauding them of a single cent, as you would
in robbing them of a thousand dollars. One breach
of honesty will ruin your character for ever, break
the fond heart of your aged parents, and probably
conduct you to an ignominious death!
Finally, my dear child, never neglect the sacred
duties of religion, a sure confidence in which can
alone support you under the sorrows of this transitory lifb, and render you triumphant over the terrors of death. Accept, my dear girl, the prayers
and blessings of
Your truly affectionate father.
From a Father to his Son, an Apprentice.
Novenmber 22d, 18-.
Dear George-As you are now become a member of another fanmily, I shall call your attention
to a few hints calculated for your benefit.
In the first place, suffer me to recommend a
strict attention to the duties of your office; you
owe it to your master, and more particularly so to
yourself, otherwise you will never gain a proper
knowledge of that business in which you are to
procure your future support. Be in all things submissive to your master, who, from his friendship
for me, will, I am convinced, do his utmost to
serve and instruct you. Remember that he now
fills my place, and is equally entitled to your obedience, and also to your affection.
Secondly, religion being the only foundation on
which the practice of all virtue can securely rest,
let me entreat that you will never, for a mioment,

neglect its solemn duties, a proper sense of which
will elevate you above the troubles of this transitory life; and will finally conduct you to another
and a better world.
Thirdly, be honest. Remember this sacred and
truly important precept is one of the immediate
commands of God. The smallest breach of which
will ruin you for ever, and bring the gray hairs of
your unfortunate parent with sorrow to the grave.
Finally, be cleanly in your person, industrious
in your habits, and obliging to all; by so doing,
you will be generally respected, and become an
honour to yourself, at the same time that you are
a comfort to your friends. You will therefore, I
am confident, my dear boy, pay a proper attention to the few hints 1 have thus given you; pe
ruse them daily, and when you do so, think upon
the writer, whose heart dictated them from an ardent desire of promoting your happiness.
I am, my dear boy,
Your affectionate father.

My dear Father-In reply to your excellent letter, I can never sufficiently testify my gratitude;
but, as the best method of doing so, will anxiously
endeavour to follow the advice contained in it, for,
be assured, my greatest pride consists in deserving
your approbation.
I am greatly pleased with my situation, and
trust I shall improve as rapidly in the business as
you can expect.

of my worthy master's kindness towards me, and

increases my guilt) I am emboldened to throw myself upon your mercy.
Pray, sir, accept my repentance. Restore me
again to your confidence and respect; be assured,
you shall never have reason to disapprove of my
future conduct; and, to convince you of my sincerity, I shall not resort to the promises of what
I will do, for which alone gratitude for your unmerited goodness will be my guide.

To a Brother-in-Law, abroad.
Philadelphia, June 4th, 18--.
Dear Brother-I have received your affectionate
letter of the 9th ult. which contains an acknowledgment of the receipt of the $10, I remitted to you
in consideration of the marriage of my niece, being
my mite towards the necessary expenses of the
happy union. I wish it had been in my power to
have advanced a greater sum; but I do assure you,
business has been, for such a length of time, much
stagnated, particularly within the last year, that it
is with difficulty we make a comfortable living.FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.          173
I was much gratified, as well as our dear aged
motlher, to find from your letter that your amiable
wife has recovered from the complaint with which

My dear Laura--As I have never withheld even
my most secret thoughts from you, I cannot avoid
informing you, that since my last letter, I have
received an offer of marriage from Mr. Dawson.
This, you will perhaps say, has been long expected.
True, my dear girl, but it is not, therefore, the less
important; especially as my lover is very ardent
in his professions, and my heart, could he discover
its inmost feelings, is no less repugnant to delay
than his own. However, my dear girl, to confess
the truth, I will inform youl that I received the
offer of his hand with all that rapture which derives its origin from pure love, and accepted with
that candour, which I sincerely trust, I shall never
(even for a moment) lose sight of. Yes, my beloved friend, the most important action of your
friend's line, on which all her future felicity or
misery depends, is finally determined upon; and
on Wednesday next, I am pledged to become the
wife of the only man I ever loved. Agreeably,
therefore, to a long-standing promise, I shall expect that you will make it convenient to attend as
my bride-maid.

thing happened to put you in mind of me, or for
some other reason equally mortifying. I am not
however so unreasonable as to expect you should
perform this act of friendship so frequently as myself; for you live in the world swarming with engagements, and my hours are almost all my own.
You must every day be employed in doing what
is expected from you by a thousand others, and I
have nothing to do but what is most agreeable to
myself.
Your mentioning Newton's Treatise on the
Prophecies, brings to my mind an anecdote of Dr.
Young, who you know died lately at Welwyn.
Dr. Cotton, who was intimate with him, paid him
a visit about a fortnight before he was seized with
his last illness. The old man was then in perfect
health; the antiquity of his person, the gravity of
his utterance, and the earnestness with which he
discoursed about religion, gave him, in the Doctor's
eye, the appearance of a prophet. They had been
delivering their sentiments upon the book of Newton, when Young closed the conference thus:"' My friend, there are two considerations upon
which my faith in Christ is built as upon a rock:
the fall of man, the redemption of man, and the
resurrection of man, the three cardinal articles of
our religion, are such as human ingenuity could
never have invented, therefore they must be divine.
The other argument is this--If the prophecies
have been fulfilled (of which there is abundant
demonstration), the Scripture must be the word
of God; and if the Scripture is the word of God,
Christianity must be true.'"
This treatise on the Prophecies serves a double
purpose: it not only proves the truth of religion,
in a manner that never had been, nor ever can be
12
177178      THE PARLOUR LETTER-WRITER.
controverted; but it proves likewise, that the Roman Catholic is the apostate and anti-christian
church, so frequently foretold both in the Old and
New Testaments. Indeed so fatally connected is
the refutation of Popery with the truth of Christianity, when the latter is evinced by the completion
of the prophecies, that in proportion as light is
thrown upon the one, the deformities and errors of
the other are more plainly exhibited. But I leave
you to the book itself: there are parts of it which
may possibly afford you less entertainment than
the rest, because you have never been a school-boy;
but in the main it is so interesting, and you are
so fond of that which is so, that I am sure you
will like it.
My dear cousin,-how happy am I in having a
friend, to whom I can open my heart upon these
subjects! I have many intimates in the world, and
have had many more than I shall have hereafter,
to whom a long letter, upon these most important
articles, would appear tiresome at least, if not impertinent. But I am not afraid of meeting with
that reception from you, wlho have never yet made
it your interest, that there should be no truth in
the word of God. May this everlasting truth be
your comfort while you live, and attend you with
peace a-nd joy in your last moments! I love you
too well not to make this a part of my prayers;
and when I remember my friends on these occasions, there is no likelihood that you can be forgotten. Yours, ever.

My dear cousin-The longer I live here, the
better I like the place, and the people who belong
to it. I am upon very good terms with no less
than five families, besides two or three odd scrambling fellows like myself. The last acquaintance
I made here is with the race of the Unwins, consisting of father and mother, son and daughter, the
most comfortable, social folks you ever knew. The
son is about twenty-one years of age, one of the
most unreserved and amiable young men I ever
conversed with. He is not yet arrived at that time
of life, when suspicion recommends itself to us in
the form of wisdom, and sets every thiig, but our
own dear selves, at an immeasurable distance firom
our esteem and confidence. Consequently he is
known almost as soon as seen; and having nothing
in his heart that makes it necessary for him to
keep it barred and bolted, opens it to the perusal
even of a stranger.-The father is a clergyman,
and the son is designed for orders. The design,
however, is quite his own, proceeding merely from
his being, and having always been, sincere in his
belief and love of' the Gospel. Another acquaintance I have lately made, is with a Mr. Nicholson,
a North-country divine, very poor, but very good,
and very happy. He reads prayers here twice aday, all the year round, and travels on foot to serve
two churches every Sunday through the year, his
journey out and home again being sixteen miles.
I supped with him last night. He gave me bread
and cheese, and a black jug of ale of his own brewing, and doubtless brewed by his own hands. An180      TIIE PARLOURI LETTER-TVRIT'ER.
other of my acquaintance is Mr. -, a thin, ta.l,
old man, and as good as he is thin. He drinks
nothing but water, and eats no flesh, partly (I believe) from a religious scruple (for he is very religious), and partly in the spirit of a valetudinarian.
H-e is to be met with every morning of his life, at
about six o'clock, at a fountain of very fine water,
about a mile from the town, which is reckoned ex
tremely like the Bristol spring. Being both early
risers, and the only early walkers in the place, we
soon became acquainted. His great piety can be
equalled by nothing, but his great regularity; for
he is the most perfect time-piece in the wvorld. I
have received a visit likewise from Mr. -. He
is very much a gentleman, well-read, and sensible.
I am persuaded, in short, that if I had had the
choice of all England where to fix my abode, I
could not have chosen better for myself, and most
likely I should not have chosen so well.
You say, you hope it is not necessary for salvation to undergo the same afflictions that I have
undergone.-No! my dear cousin, God deals with
his children as a merciful father; he does not, as
he himself tells us, afflict willingly the sons of men.
Doubtless there alre many who, having been placed,
by his good providence, out of the reach of any
great evil, and the influence of bad example, have,
from their very infancy, been partakers of the
grace of his Holy Spirit, in such a manner as never to have allowed themselves in any grievous offence against him. May you love him more and
more, day by day; as every day, while you think
upon him, you will find him more worthy of your
love: and may you be finally accepted by him for
his sake, whose intercession for all his faithful servants cannot but prevail! Yours ever.FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.

Mv dear Cousin-I should grumble at your long
silence, if I did not know, that one may love one's
friends very well, though one is not always in a
humour to write to them. Besides, I have the satisfaction of being perfectly sure, that you have at
least twenty times recollected the debt you owe
me, and as often resolved to pay it: and perhaps,
while you remain indebted to me, you think of me
twice as often as you would do if the account was
clear. These are the reflections with which I comfort myself under the affliction of not hearing from
you: my temper does not incline me to jealousy,
and if it did, I should set all right by having recourse to what I have already received from you.
I thank God for your friendship, and for every
friend I have; for all the pleasing circumstances
here, for my health of body, and perfect serenity
of mind. To recollect the past, and compare it
with the present, is all I have need of to fill me
with gratitude; and to be grateful is to be happy.
Not that 1 think myself sufficiently thankful, or
that I ever shall be so in this life. The warmest
heart perhaps only feels by fits, and is often as insensible as the coldest. This at least is frequently
the case with mine, and oftener than it should be.
But the mercy that can forgive iniquity, will never be severe to mark our frailties. To that mercy, my dear cousin, I commend you, with earnest
wishes for your welfare, and remain your ever affectionate.;

Lord
April 27th, 18-.
Your kind letter found me on board the Croco
dile: I should have been very unhappy had it
missed me, since I have long habituated myself to
set the highest value on every word you speak, and
every line you write. Of the two inclosed letters
to our friend, Impey and Chambers, I will take the
greatest care, and will punctually follow your -directions as to the first of then. My departure was
sudden indeed; but the Admiralty were so anxious
for the sailing of this frigate, and their orders
were so peremptory, that it was impossible to wait
for any thing but a breeze. Our voyage has hitherto been tolerably pleasant, and, since we left the
Channel, very quick. We begin to see albicores
about the ship, and to perceive an agreeable change
of climate. Our days, though short, give me ample time for study, recreation, and exercise; but
my joy and delight proceed from the surprising
health and spirits of Anna Maria, who joins me
in affectionate remembrance to lady Ashburton.
As to you, my dear lord, we consider you as the
spring and fountain of our happiness, as the author and parent (a Roman would have added, what
the coldness of our northern language will hardly
admit, the god) of our fortunes. It is possible indeed, that by incessant labour and irksome attendance at the bar, I might in due time have attained
all that my very limited ambition could aspire to;
but in no other station than that which I owe to
your friendship, could I have gratified at once my

jury of Denbighshire have found, I understand,

I shall certainly not preach them to the Indians,
who must and will be governed by absolute power,
yet I shall go through life with a persuasion, that
they are just and rational; that substantial freedom is both the daughter and parent of virtue; and
that virtue is the only source of public and private

You would readily excuse my delay in answering your obliging letter, if you could form an idea
of the incessant hurry and confusion, in which I
have been kept ever since my arrival in Bengal,
by necessary business or necessary formalities, and
by the difficulty of settling myself to my mind, in
a country so different from that which I have left.
I am indeed, at best, but a bad correspondent; for
I never write by candle-ligllt; and find so much
Arabic or Persian to read, that all my leisure in a
morning is hardly sufficient for a thousandth part
of the reading that would be highly agreeable and
useful to me; and as I purpose to spend the long
vacation up the country, I wish to be a match in
conversation with the learned natives, whom I
may happen to meet.

I rejoice that you are so near, but lament that
you are not nearer; and am not without hope, that
you may one day be tempted to visit Bengal, where
I flatter myself you will give me as much of your
company as possible.
Many thanks for your kind hints in regard to
my health. As to me, I do not expect, as long as
I stay in India, to be free from a bad digestion, the
morbus literatorum, for which there is hardly any
remedy, but abstinence from too much food, literary and culinary. I rise before the sun, and bathe
after a gentle ride; my diet is light and sparing,
and I go early to rest; yet the activity of my mind
is too strong for my constitution, though naturally
not infirm, and I must be satisfied with a valetudinarian state of health. If you should meet with
any curiosities on the coast, either in your botanical rambles or in reading, and will communicate
them to our society, lately instituted for inquiring
inlto the history, civil and natural, the antiquities,
arts, and sciences, and literature of Asia, we shall
give you our hearty thanks. There is an Abyssinian here, who knew Mr. Bruce, at Gwender.
I have examined him, and he confirms Bruce's account. Every day supplies me with something
new in Oriental learning; and if I were to stay
here half a century, I should be continually amused.

Had I dreamt that the dialogue would have

and I intended to inculcate, that the principles of
government were so obvious and intelligible, that
a clown might be brought to understand them. As
to raising sedition, I as much thought of raising a

My dialogue contains my system, which I have
ever avowed, and ever will avow; but I perfectly
agree (and no man of sound intellect can disagree)

Dear Sister-I am highly pleased with the account Captain Freeman gives me of you. I always
judged by your behaviour when a child, that you
would make a good, agreeable woman, and you
know you were ever my peculiar favourite.  I
have been thinking what would be a suitable present for me to make, and for you to receive, as I
hear you have grown a celebrated beauty. I had
almost determined on a tea-table; but when I considered that the character of a good housewife was
far preferable to that of being only a pretty gentlewoman, I concluded to send you a spinningwheel, which I hope you will accept as a small token of my sincere love and affection.
Sister, farewell, and remember that modesty, as
it makes the most homely virgin amiable and
charming, so the want of it infallibly renders the

when that brightest of female virtues shines among

We have had the small-pox here lately, which
raged violently while it lasted. Thlere have been
about fifty persons inoculated, who all recovered,
except a child of the doctor's, upon whom the
small-pox appeared within a day or two after the
operation, and who is therefore thought to have
been certainly infected before. In one family in
my neighbourhood there appeared a great mortality. Mr. George Claypole (a descendant of Oliver
Cromwell) had, by industry, acquired a great estate, and being in excellent business, a merchant,
would probably have doubled it, had he lived according to the common course of years. He died
first, suddenly; within a short time died his best
negro; then one of his children; then a negro
woman; then two children more, buried at the
same time; then two more; so that I saw two
double buryings come out of the house in one
week. None were left in the family, but the mothller and one child, and both their lives till lately
despaired of; so that all the father's wealth, which
everybody thought, a little while ago, had heirs

the reversion, was in a few weeks brought to the

OBSERVATIONS AND DIRECTIONS ON THE ART
OF LETTER-WRITING.
THERE are few school tasks which children may
be induced to perform with greater pleasure, and
which, at the same time, are of' more advantage to
them, than that of writing letters. Young people
are naturally delighted with so happy a contrivance
to make known their wants and their wishes to
their absent friends, and to carry on a sort of conversation upon paper with persons at a distance.
One would think that if they were properly assisted in their first attempts, they could not fail of
making a rapid proficiency. How comes it then
to pass that so few are capable of writing a good
letter? Is it owing to the difficulty of the thing
itself, or to some fundamental error in this part of
education? My reasons for inclining to the latter
opinion will be seen in the following remaris:
Whatever appears likely to be obtained with
ease, or by common use, is in general too much
disregarded. Hence the neglect of English graummar, the bad consequences of which are every
day apparent; and hence, also, the little pains taken
to mlake childrell expert in the art of letter-writ2188      THE PARLOUR LETTER-WRITER.
prudent use of quicksilver in the cure of the itch,
Mr. Claypole applyirng it as he thought proper,
without consulting a physician for fear of charges;
and the small-pox coming upon them at the same
time, made their case desperate.
But what gives me the greatest concern, is the
account you give me of my sister Holmes's misfortune. I know a cancer in the breast is often
thought incurable; yet we have here in town a
kind of shell made of some wood, cut at a proper
time, by some man of great skill, (as they say,)
which has done wonders in that disease among us,
being worn for some time on the breast. I am
not apt to be superstitiously fond of believing such
things, but the instances are so well attested, as
sufficiently to convince the most incredullous.
This, if' I have interest enough to procure, as I
think I have, I will borrow for a time, and send
it to you, and hope the doctors you have will at
least allow the experiment to be tried, and shall
rejoice to hear it has the accustomed effect.
You have mentioined nothing in your letter of
our dear parents; but I conclude they are well,
because you say nothing to the contrary. I want
to hear-from sister Douse, and to know of her welfare, as also of my sister Lydia, who I hear is lately married. I intended to have visited you this
summer, but printing the paper-money here has
hindered me near two months, and our Assembly

Dear Sister-I received your letter, with one
for Benny, and one for Mr. Parker, and also two
of Benny's letters of complaint, which, as you observe, do not amount to much. I should have had
a very bad opinion of him, if he had written to
you those accusations of his master, which you
mention; because, from long acquaintance with
his master, who lived some years in my house, I
knowv him to be a sober, pious, and conscientious
man; so that Newport, to whom you seem to have
given too much credit, must have wronged Mr. Parker very much in his accounts, and have wronged
Benny too, if he says Benny told him such things,
for I am confident he never did.
As to the bad attendance afforded him in the
small-pox, I believe, if the negro woman did not
do her duty, her master or mistress would, if they
had known it, have had that matter mended. But
Mrs. Parker was herself, if I am not mistaken,
sick at that time, and her child also. And though
he gives the woman a bad character in general,
all he charges her with in particular, is, that she
never brought him what he called for directly,
and sometimes not at all. He had the distemper
favourably, and yet I suppose was bad enough
to be, like other sick people, a little impatient,
and perhaps might think a short time long, and
sometimes call for things not proper for one in
his condition.
As to clothes, I am frequently at New York,
and I never saw him unprovided with what was
good, decent, and sufficient. I was there no longer ago than March last, and he was then well
clothed, and made no complaint to mc of any kind.
189190      THE PARLOUR LETTER-WRITER.
I heard both his master and mistress call upon
him  on Sunday morning to get ready to go to
meeting, and tell him of his fiiequently delaying
and shuffling till it was too late, and he made not
the least objection about clothes. I did not think
it any thing extraordinary, that he should be sonmetimes willing to evade going to meeting, for I
believe it is the case with all boys, or almost all.
I have brought up four or five myself, and have
frequently observed, that if their shoes were bad,
they would say nothing of a new pair till Sunday
morning, just as the bell rung, when, if you asked
them why they did not get ready, the answer was
prepared, "'I have no shoes," and so of other
things, hats and the like; or if they knew of any
thing that wanted mending, it was a secret till
Sunday morning, and sometimes I believe they
would rather tear a little, than be without the excuse.
As to going on petty errands, no boys love it,
but all must do it. As soon as they become fit
for better business, they naturally get rid of tlhat,
for the master's interest comes in to their relief:
I make no doubt but Mr. Parker will take another
apprentice, as soon as he can meet with a likely
one. In the mean time I should be glad if Benny
would exercise a little patience. There is a negro
woman that does a great many of those errands.
I do not think his going on board the privateer
arose from any difference between him and his
master, or any ill usage he had received. When
boys see prizes brought in, and quantities of money
shared among the men, and their gay living, it
fills their heads with notions, that half distract
them, and put them quite out of conceit with trades,
and the dull ways of getting money by working.FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.
This I suppose was Ben's case, the Catherine being just before arrived with three prizes; and that
the glory of having taken a privateer of the enemy,
for which both officers and men were highly extolled, treated, presented, &amp;c., worked strongly
upon his imagination, you will see, by his answer
to my letter, is not unlikely. I send it to you inclosed. I wrote him largely on the occasion; and
though he might possibly, to excuse that slip to
others, complain of' his place, you may see he says
not a syllable of any such thing to me. My only
son, before I permitted him to go to Albany, left
my house unknown to us all, and got on board a
privateer, from whence I ftched him.  No one
imagined it was hard usage at home, that made
him do this. Every one, that knows me, thinks
I am too indulgent a parent, as well as a master.
I shall tire you, perhaps, with the length of this
letter; but I am the more particular, in order, if
possible, to satisfy your mind about your son's
situation. His master has, by a letter this post,
desired me to write to him about his staying out
at nights, sometimes all night, and refusing to give
an account wl:ere he spends his time, or in what

perceive you have. I do not wonder at his correcting him for that. If he was my own son, I
should think his master did not do his duty by

road to destruction. And I think the correction
very light, and not likely to be very effectual, if
the strokes left no marks.
His master says farther, as follows:-" I think

lay his complaints before you, that I may know
how to remedy them." Thus far the words of
his letter, which giving me a fair opening to inquire
into the affair, I shall accordingly do it, and I hope
settle every thing to all your satisfactions. In the
mean time, I have laid by your letters both to Mr.
Parker and Benny, and shall not send them till I
hear again from you, because I think your appearing to give ear to such groundless stories may give
offence, and create a greater misunderstanding, and
because I think what you write to Benny, about
getting him discharged, may tend to unsettle his
mind, and therefore improper at this time.
I have a very good opinion of Benny in the main,
and have great hopes of his becoming a worthy
man, his faults being only such as are commonly
incident to boys of his years, and he has many
good qualities, for which I love him. I never
knew an apprentice contented with the clothes allowed him by his master, let them be what they
would. Jemmy Franklin, when with me, was always dissatisfied and grumbling. When I was
last in Boston, his aunt bid him go to a shop and
please himself, which the gentleman did, and
bougllt a suit of clothes on my account dearer by
one-half than any I ever afforded myself, one suit
excepted; which I don't mention by way of complaint of Jemmy, for he and I are good friends,
but only to show you the nature of boys.

From an English Nobleman in Queen Elizabeth's
reign, to his Son.
[This quaint and curious letter is inserted rather for the
matter than the style. It abounds in piety and practical
wisdom; and furnishes many admirable precepts for
the conduct of life, which the young men of our own
time would do well to respect and reduce to practice.]
I have received two letters from you, one written
in Latin, the other in French, which I take in good
part, and wish you to exercise that practice of
learning often; for that will stand you in most
stead, in that profession of life that you are born
to live in. ~ And, since this is my first letter that
ever I did write to you, I will not, that it will be
all empty of some advices, which my natural care
of you provoketh me to wish you to follow, as
documents to you in this your tender age. Let your
first action be, the lifting up of your mind to Almighty God, by hearty prayer, and feelingly digest
the words you speak in prayer with continual
meditation, and thinking of him to whom you pray,
and of the manner for which you pray. And use
this as an ordinary, at, and at an ordinary hour.
Whereby the time itself will put you in remembrance to do that which you are accustomed to do.
In that time apply your study to such h6urs as
your discreet master doth assign you earnestly;
and the time (I know) he will so limit, as shall be
both sufficient for your learning, and safe for your
health. And mark the sense and the matter of that
you read, as well as the words. So shall you both
enrich your' tongue with words and your wit with
matter; and judgment will grow as years groweth

in you. Be humble and obedient to your master,
for unless you frame yourself to obey others, yea,
and feel in yourself what obedience is, you shall
never be able to teach others, how to obey you. Be
courteous of gesture, and affable to all men, with
diversity of reverence,, according to the dignity of
the person. There is nothing that winneth so
much with so little cost.. Use moderate diet, so as,
after. your meat, you may find your wit fresher,
and not duller, and your body more lively, and not
more heavy. Seldom drink wine, and yet sometime do, lest being enforced to drink upon the sudden, you should find yourself inflanmed. Use exercise of body, but such as is without peril of your
joints or bones. It will increase your force, and
enlarge your breath. Delight to be cleanly, as well
in all parts of your body as in your garments. It
shall make you grateful in each company, and
otherwise loathsome. Give yourself to be merry,
for you degenerate from your father, if you find
niot yourself most able, in wit and body, to do any
thing, when you be most merry; but let your mirth
be ever void of all scurrility and biting words to
any man, for a wound given by a word is oftentimes harder to be cured, than that which is given
with the sword. Be you rather a hearer and bearer
away of other men's talk than a beginner or procurer of speech, otherwise you shall be counted to
delight to hear yourself speak. If you hear a wise
sentence, or an apt phrase, commit it to your
memory, with respect of the circumstance, when
you shall speak it. Let never oath be heard to
come out of your mouth, nor words of ribaldry;
detest it in others, so shall custom make to yourself a lawv against it in yourself. Be modest in
each assembly, and rather be rebuked of light fellows, for maiden-like shamefacedness, than of your
sad friends for pert boldness. Think upon every
word that you will speali, before you utter it, and
remember how nature hath rampired up (as it
were) tlhe tongue with teeth, lips, yea, and hair
without the lips, and all betokening reins, or bridles,
for the loose use of that member. Above all things
tell no untruth, no not in trifles. The custom i it
is naughty; and let it not satisfy you, that, for a
time, the hearers take it for a truth, for after it will
be known as it is, to your shame; for there cannot
be a greater reproach to a gentleman than to be
accounted a liar. Study and endeavour yourself
to be virtuously cccupied. So shall you malke suclh
an habit of well doing in you, that you shall not
know how to do evil, though you would. Remember, my son, thle noble blood you are descended of,
by your mother's side; and think, that only by
virtuous life and good action you imay be an ornament to that illustrious family; and otherwise,
through vice and sloth, you shlall be counted labes

to man. Well (my little Philip,) this is enough
for me, and too much I fear for you. Buit if I she ll

great pleasure you have given me, long before now.
The very good account you give me of your studies, and that delivered in very good Latin, for

course of your life, that you can only acquire now
by your emulation and noble labours in the pursuit
of learning, and of every acquirement that is to
make you superior to other gentlemen. I rejoice
to hear that you have begun Homer's Iliad; and
have made _so great a progress in Virgil. I hope
you taste and love those authors particularly. You
cannot read them too much; they are not only the
two greatest poets, but they contain the finest lessons for your age to imbibe: lessons of honour,
courage, disinterestedness, love of truth, command
of temper, gentleness of behaviour, humanity, and,
in one word, virtue in its true signification. Go

ing, which, next to speaking well, is an accomplishment of the greatest utility and importance.
Even those who thought it deserving of some attention, fancied that practice alone must lead to excellence, and that they could simplify the whole
art, by telling the young essayist that letters should
be easy and natural, and should convey to the persons to whom we send them, just what we would
say to those persons if we were with them. But
general instructions are of little use, till they are
unfolded, and applied to particular cases. Besides,
the precept here laid down, with all its seeming
simplicity, is not only vague, but fallacious. It
lhas given a sort of sanction to the most careless,
slovenly, and incoherent eff-usions; and the idea of
being easy and natural, has occasioned greater
errors in the epistolary style than a total disregard,
or ignorance, of every rule. The benighted traveller pursues his way with more safety, even in the
dark, than when he is guided by a delusive
meteor.
Let us-now examine the boasted accuracy, the
much-admired simplicity of this precept, which
has been so readily adopted by the fashionable
world. It tells us, that letters should be easy and
natural: so should every good piece of writing as
well as a letter. The appearance of art and labour is
not allowable in any species of composition. Even
the poet, in his highest flights, must betray no indications of straining; and the great beauty of
Homer's style in his Iliad, is its being as easy
and as natural as that of Gay in the simplest of
his fables. A precept, therefore, so vague as to be
applicable to all kinds of writing, can never promote our particular improvement in the epistolary
style, but may, on the contrary, retard it, by exciting inaccurate or confused ideas.198      THE PARLOUR LETTER-WRITER.

My dear Nephew-Your letter from Cambridge
affords me many very sensible pleasures: first,
that you are at last in a proper place for study and
improvement, instead of losiing any more of that
most precious thing, time, in London. In the
next place, that you seem pleased with the particular society you are placed in, and with the gentle-c
man to whose care and instructions you are committed: and, above all, I applaud the sound, right
sense, and love of virtue, which appears through
yoiur whole letter. You are already possessed of
the true clue to guide you through this dangerous
and perplexing part of your life's journey, the years
of education; and upon which, the complexion of
all the rest of your days will infallibly depend; I
say you have the true clue to guide you, -in the
maxim you lay down in your letter to me; namely, that the use of learning is, to render a man
more wise and virtuous; not merely to make him
more learned. Macte tua virtute: Go on, my dear
boy, by this golden rule, and you cannot fail tobecome every thing your generous heart prompts
you to wish to be, and that minsmost affectionately wishes for you. There is rut one danger in
your way; and that is, perhaps, natural enough to
your age, the love of pleasure, or the fear of close
application and laborious diligence. With the last
there is nothing you may not conquer: and the

not strenuously resist the first allurements of it,

wish to please, and really unenjoyable to yourself.

of life, will repay you a hundred fold, in the pleasures, honours, and advantages of all the remainder of your days. My heart is so full of the most
earnest desire that you should do well, that I find
my letter has run into some length, which you
will, I know, be so good to excuse. There remains
now nothing to trouble you with, but a little plan
for the beginning of your studies, which I desire,
in a particular manner, may be exactly followed in

Muses amidst the very savage rocks and moors,
and yet more savage natives, of the ancient and

in general I much disapprove the use of it; it is
chiefly intended for persons who mean to be authors, and tends to impair the memory, and to deprive you of a ready, extempore use of your reading, by accustoming the mind to discharge itself
of its reading on paper, instead of relying on its
natural power of retention, aided and fortified by
frequent revisions of its ideas and materials. Some
things must be common-placed in order to be of
any use; dates, chronological order, and the like;
for instance, Nathaniel Bacon ought to be extracted in the best method you can; but in general my
advice to you is, not to common-place upon paper,
but, as an equivalent to it, to endeavour to range
and methodize in your head what you read, and by
so doing frequently and habitually to fix matter in
the memory. I desired you some time since to
read Lord Clarendon's History of the Civil Wars.

is the History of the Parliament, by Thomas May,

You don't know how I long to hear how your
declamation was received; and "all about it," as
we say in these parts. I hope to see it, when I
see its author and pronouncer. Themistocles, no
doubt, received due praise from you for his valour
and subtlety, but I trust you poured down a torrent of eloquent indignation upon the ruling prinLETTERS OF ADVICE.
ciples of his actions, and the motives of his conduct; while you exalted the mild and unassuming
virtues of his more amiable rival. The object of
Themistocles was the aggrandizement of himself:
that of Aristides the welfare and prosperity of the
state. The one endeavoured to swell the glory of
his country; the other to promote its security, external and internal, foreign and domestic. While
you estimated the services which Themistocles
rendered to the state, in opposition to those of Aristides, you of course remembered, that the former
had the largest scope for action, and that he influenced his countrymen to fall into all his plans,
while they banished his competitor, not by his superior wisdom or goodness, but by those intrigues
and factious artifices which Aristides would have
disdained. Themistocles certainly did use bad
means to a desirable end: and, if we may assume
it as an axiom, that Providence will forward the
designs of a good, sooner than those of a bad man,
whatever inequality of abilities there may be between the two charaicters, it will follow that-had
Athens remained under the guidance of Aristides,
it would have been better for her. The difference
between Themistocles and Aristides seems to me
to be this: That the former was a wise and afortunate man; and that the latter, though he had
equal wisdom, had not equal good fortune. We
may admire the heroic qualities and the crafty
policy of the one, but to the temperate and disinterested patriotism, the good and virtuous dispositions of the other, we can alone give the meed of
heart-felt praise.
I only mean by this, that we must not infer
Themistocles to have been the better or the greater
man, because he rendered more essential services
205206      TIIE PARLOUR LETTER-WRITER.
to the state than Aristides, nor even that his sys
temrn was the most judicious,-but only that, by de
cision of character, and by good fortune, his measures succeeded best.
The rules of composition are, in my opinion,
very few. If we have a mature acquaintance with
our subject, there is little fear of our expressing it
as we ought, provided we have had some little experience in writing. The first thing to be aimed at
is perspicuity. That is the great point, which, once
attained, will make all other obstacles smooth to
us. In order to write perspicuously, we should
have a perfect knowledge of the topic on which
we are about to treat, in all its bearings and dependencies. We should think well, beforehand,
what will be the clearest method of conveying the
drift of our design. This is similar to what painters call the massing, ox getting the effect of the
more prominent lights and shades by broad dashes
of the pencil. When our thesis is well arranged
in our mind, and we have predisposed our arguments, reasonings, and illustrations, so as they
shall all conduce to the object in view, in regular
sequence and gradation, we may sit down and express our ideas in as clear a manner as we can,
always using such words as are most suited to our
purpose, and, when two modes of expression, equally luminous, present themselves, selecting that
which is the most harmonious and elegant.
It sometimes happens that writers, in aiming at
perspicuity, over-reach themrselves, by employing
too many words, and perplex the mind by a multiplicity, of illustrations. This is a very fatal error.
Circuinlocution seldom conduces to plainness; and
you nmay take it as a maxim, that, when once anidea is clearly expressed, every additional stroke
will only confuse the mind, and diminish the effect.
When you have once learned to express yourself with clearness and propriety, you will soon
arrive at elegance. Every thing else, in fact, will
follow as of course. But I warn you not to invert
the order of things, and be paying your addresses
to the graces, when you ought to be studying perspicuity. Young writers, in general, are too solicitous to round off their periods, and regulate the
cadences of their style. Hence the feeble pleonasms, and idle repetitions, which deform their
pages.  If you would have your compositions
vigorous and masculine in their tone, let every
word TELL; and when you detect yourself polishing off a sentence with expletives, regard yourself
in exactly the same predicament with a poet, who
should eke out the measure of his verses with
"titum, titum, tee, sir."

207THIIE ART OF LE'rTTER-WITING.     19
Every idle, thoughtless and superficial scribbler
fancies, or flatters himself in the opinion, that natural ease consists in dashing down upon paper all
his insipid trifles, his silly conceits, his tiresome
repetitions-Emittet quicquid in buccam venit-He
writes whatever comes uppermost, and discharges
all his crudities at his friend, without decency and
without mercy.
But he wishes to avoid appearing stiff, formal
or affected. The affectation of slovenliness is certainly less excusable than'that of nicety: as to
being formal, though we may not stand upon ceremony with an intimate acquaintance, yet surely
all our politeness is not to be reserved for strangers;
and, lastly, with respect to stiffness, a little attention to the proper arrangement of our ideas, and
to the choice of our words, is so far from destroying natural ease and elegance, that they cannot be
acquired by any other means.

But the second part of the beforementioned precept for writing letters is, if possible, more vague
and inaccurate than the first. It says, that they
should convey to the persons to whom we send
them, just what we would say to those persons if
we were with them. This seems at first sight
very plausible and proper. As letters are defined
a conversation between absent persons, can we follow a better rule than to write to others as we would
speak;to them, if they were present? But in the
first place, it is evident that this rule either has no
meaning, or must suppose us to speak well: otherwise, to write as we speak would not be the way

rate but for five or six years longer, you will dis.
tinguish yourself extremely, and become very considerable; but then, they added, (for I must tell
you all,) that they observed many forward boys
stop short on a sudden, from giddiness and inattention, and turn out great blockheads at last. I
answered for you, that this would not happen to
you; for that you were thoroughly sensible of the
usefulness and necessity of knowledge; that you
knew it could not be acquired without pains and
attention; and that you knew too, that the next
four or five years were the only time of your life
in which you could acquire it. Of this, I must
confess, they doubted a little, and desired I would
remember to show them somle of your exercises a
year hence, which I promised I would do: so pray
take care to advance, lest what is so much to your
honour now, should then prove to your disgrace.
Non progiredi est regredi, is a very true maxim in
most things, but is particularly true with regard
to learning. I am very glad Mr. Maittaire puts
you upon making themes, for that will use you to
think; and your writing them in English, as well
as in Latin and Greek, will improve you in your
own language, and teach you both to write and
speak it with purity and elegance, which it is most
absolutely necessary to do; for though, indeed,
the justness and strength of the thoughts are the
most material points, and that words are but the
dress of thoughts; yet, as a very handsome man
or woman may be disfigured, and rendered even
disagreeable, by an awkward, slovenly, and raggedLETTERS OF ADVICE.
dress, so good thoughts may lose great part of their
beauty, if expressed in low, improper, and inelegant words.  People mistake very much, who
imagine that they must of course speak their own
language well, and that therefore they need not
study it, or attend to it: but you will soon find
how false this way of reasoning is, if you observe
the English spoken by almost all English people
who have no learning. Most women, and all the
ordinary people in general, speak in open defiance
of all grammar, use words that are not English,
and murder those that are; and though, indeed,
they make themselves understood, they do it so
disagreeably, that what they say, seldom makes
amends for their manner of saying it. I have
this day received a letter from Mr. Maittaire, in
which he gives me a better account of you than
usual; which pleases me so much that you shall
be well rewarded for it when I see you; that will
be before it is very long; so you need not write to
me any more. Adieu.
As you arc now in the way of themes, I send
you this to exercise your thoughts upon against I
come to town;
Sapere et fari quve sentiat.
It is an epistle from Horace to Tibullus; if you
read the whole epistle, which is a short and easy
ode, with Mr. Maittaire, you will see how those
words are introduced; then you will consider what
are the advantages, and the means of acquiring
them. If you can illustrate them by the examples
of some who possessed those talents eminently, it
will do well. And if you can find out a simile
very applicable to the possession or the want of
those talents, it will adorn the composition.

Sir,-The fame of your erudition, and other
shining qualifications, having reached to Lord
Orrery, he desires me that you might dine with
him and his son, Lord Boyle; next Sunday; which
I told him you should. By this time I suppose
you have heard from him; if you have not, you
must, however, go there between two and three
to-morrow; and say, that you come to wait upon
Lord Boyle, according to his lordship's orders, of
which I informed you. As this will deprive me
of the honour and pleasure of your company at
dinner to-morrow, I will hope for it at breakfast,
and shall take care to have your chocolate ready.
Though I need not tell one of your age, experience, and knowledge of the world, how necessary
good breeding is, to recommend one to mankind;
yet, as your various occupations of Greek and
cricket, Latin and pitch-farthing may possibly divert your attention from this object, I take the
liberty of reminding you of it, and desiring you
to be very well-bred at Lord Orrery's. It is good
breeding alone, that can prepossess people in your
favour at first sight: more time being necessary to
discover greater talents. This good breeding, you
know, does not consist in low bows and formal
ceremony; but in an easy, civil behaviour. You
will take care, therefore, to answer with complaisance, when you are spoken to; to place yourself
at the lower end of the table, unless bid to go
higher; to drink first to the lady of the house,
and next to the master; not to eat awkwardly or
dirtily; not to sit when others stand; and to do all
this with an air of complaisance, and not witli aLETTERS OF ADVICE.           211
grave, sour look, as if you did it all unwillingly.
I do not mean a silly, insipid smile, that fools have
when they would be civil; but an air of sensible
good humour. I hardly know any thing so difficult to attain, or so necessary to possess, as per.
feet good breeding; which is equally inconsistent
with a stiff formality, an impertinent forwardness,
and an awkward bashfulness. A little ceremony
is often necessary; a certain degree of firmness is
absolutely so; and an outward modesty is extremely becoming: the knowledge of the world, and
your own observations, must, and alone can, tell
you the proper quantities of each.
Mr. Fitzgerald was with me yesterday, and commended you much: go on to deserve commendations, and you will certainly nleet with them.

Dear Boy,-Good breeding is so important an
article in life, and so absolutely necessary for you,
if you would please and be well received in the
world, that I must give you another lecture upon
it, and possibly this will not be the last, neither.
I only mentioned in my last, the general rules of
common civility, which whoever does not observe,
will pass for a bear, and be as unwelcome as one,
in company; and there is hardly anybody brutal
enough not to answer when they are spoken to, or
not to say, sir, my lord, or madam, according to
the rank of the people they speak to. But it is
not enough not to be rude: you should be extremely civil, and distinguished for your good breeding.
-The first principle of this good breeding is, ne212       THE PPARLOUR LETTER-WRITER.
ver to say any thing you think can be disagreeable

ble to them, and that in an easy and natural manner, without seeming to study for compliments.
There is likewise such a thing as a civil look and
a rude look: and you should look civil as well as
be so; for if, while you are saying a civil thing,
you look gruff and surly, as most English bumpkins do, nobody will be obliged to you for a civility
that seemed to come so unwillingly. If you have
occasion to contradict anybody, or to set them
right from a mistake, it would be very brutal to
say, That is not so; I know better; or, You are
out; but you should say, with a civil look, I beg
your pardon, I believe you mistake; or, If I mnay
take the liberty of contradicting you, I believe it is
so and so; for, though you may know a thing better than other people, yet it is very shocking to tell
them so directly, without something to soften it;
but remember particularly, that whatever you say
or do, with ever so civil an intention, a great deal
consists in the manner and the look, which must
be genteel, easy, and natural, and is easier to be
felt than described.
Civility is particularly due to all women; and
remember that no provocation whatsoever can justify any man in not being civil to every woman;
and the greatest man in England would justly be
reckoned a brute, if he were not civil to the meanest woman. It is due to their sex, and is the only
protection they have against the superior strength
of' ours. I repeat it again to you; observe the
French people, and mind how easily and naturally
civil their address is, and how agreeably they insinuate little civilities in their conversation. TheyLETTERS OF ADVICE.
think it so essential, that they call an honest man
and a civil man by the same name, of honnete
homme; and the Romans called civility hunmanitas,
as thinking it inseparable from humanity. As
nobody can instruct you in good breeding better
than your mamma, be sure you mind all she says
to you upon that subject: and depend upon it that
your reputation and success in the world, will, in
a great measure, depend upon the degree of good
breeding you are master of. You cannot begin
too early to take that turn, in order to make it natural and habitual to you; which it is to very few
Englishmen, who, neglecting it while they are
young, find out too late, when they are old, how
necessary it is, and then cannot get it right. There
is hardly a French cook that is not better bred
than most Englishmen of quality, and that cannot
present himself with more ease, and a better address, in any mixed company. Renmember to practise all this; and then, with the learning which I
hope you will have, you may arrive at what I
reckon almost the perfection of human nature,
English knowledge with French good breeding.
Adieu.

Dear Boy,-I have received your last Saturday's
performance, with which I am very well satisfied.
I know or have heard of no Mr. St. Maurice here;
and young Pain, whom I have made an ensign,
was here upon the spot, as were every one of those
I have named in these new levies.
Now that the Christmas breaking up draws near,
I have ordered Mr. Dcesnosyers to go to you, during
213TIIE PARLOUR LETTER-WRITER.
that time, to teach you to dance. I desire that you
will particularly attend to the graceful motion of
your arms; which, with the manner of putting on
your hat, and giving your hand, is all that a gentleman need attend to. Dancing is in itself a very
trifling, silly thing; but it is one of those established fbllies to which people of sense are sometimes
obliged to conform; and then they should be able
to do it well. And though I would not have you
a dancer, yet when you do dance, I would have
you dance well-; as I would have you do every
thing you do well. There is no one thing so trifling, but which (if it is to be done at all,) ought
to be done well; and I have often told you that I
wished you even played at pitch and criclket better
than any boy at Westminster. For instance, dress
is a very foolishl thing, and yet it is a very foolish
thing for a man not to be well dressed, according
to his rank and way of life; and it is so far from
being a disparagement to any man's understanding, that it is rather a proof of it, to be as well
dressed as those whom he lives with: the difference in this case between a man of sense and a
fop is, that the fop values himself upon his dress;
and the man of sense laughs at it, at the same time
that he knows he must not neglect it. There are
a thousand foolish customs of this kind, which, not
being criminal, must be complied with, and even
cheerfilly, by men of sense. Diogenes the cynic
was a wise man for despising them; but a fool for
showing it. Be wiser than other people, if you
can; but do not tell them so.
It is a very fortunate thing for Sir Charles Hotham, to have fallen into the hands of one of your
age, experience, and knowledge of the world: I
aml persuaded you will take infinite care of him,
Good night.

Feb. 16, 18--.
Dear Boy,-The first use that I made of my liberty, was to come hither, where I arrived yesterday. My health, though not fundamentally bad,
yet, for want of proper attention of late, wanted
some repairs, which these waters never fail giving
it. I shall drink them a month, and return to London, there to enjoy the comforts of social life, instead of groaning under the load of business. I
have given the description of the life that I proposed to lead for the future, in this motto, which I
have put up in the frieze of my library in my new
house.
Nune veterulmn libris, nune somno, et inertibus boris
Ducere sollicitae jucunda oblivia vit:e.
I must observe to you, upon this occasion, that the
uninterrupted satisfaction which I expect to find
in that library will be chiefly owing to my having
employed some part of my life well at your age. I
wish I had employed it better, and my satisfaction
would now be complete; but, however, I planted
while young, that degree of knowledge which is
now my refuge and my shelter. Make your plantations still more extensive, they will more than
pay you for your trouble. I do not regret the time
that I passed in pleasures; they were seasonable,
they were the pleasures of youth, and I enjoyed
them while young. If I had not, I should probably have overvalued them now, as we are very apt
to do what we do not know: but knowing them
as I do, I know their real value, and how much
they are generally overrated. Nor do I regret the
time that I have passed in business, for the same2-16     THE PARLOUR LETTERV-WRITER.
reason; those who see only the outside of it, imagine that it has hidden charms, which they pant
after; and nothing but acquaintance can undeceive them. I, who have been behind the scenes,
both of pleasure and business, and have seen all
the springs and pulleys of those decorations which
astonish and dazzle the audience, retire, not only
without regret, but with contentment and satisfaction. But what I do, and ever shall regret, is the
time which, while young, I lost in mere idleness,
and in doing nothing. This is the common effect
of the inconsideracy of youth, against which I beg
you will be most carefully upon your guard. The
value of moments, when cast up, is immense, if
well employed; if thrown away, their loss is irrecoverable. Every moment may be put to some
use, and that with much more pleasure than if unemployed. Do not imagine that by the empIoyment of time I mean an uninterrupted application
to serious studies. No; pleasures are, at proper
times, both as necessary and useful; they fashion
and form you for the world, they teach you characters,, and show you the human heart in its unguarded minutes. But then remember to make
that use of th,nm. I have known many people,
from laziness of mind, go through both pleasure
and business with equal inattention; neither enjoying the one nor the other; thinking themselves
men of pleasure, because they were mingled with
those who were, and men of business, because they
had business to do, though they did not do it.
Whlatever you do, do it to thepurpose; do it thoroughly, not superficially. Appirofondissez; go to
the bottom of the things. Any thing half done,
or half known, is, in my mind, neither done nor
known at all. Nay worse, for it often misleads.LETTERS OF ADVICE.
There is hardly any place, or any company, where
you may not gain knowledge, if you please; almost everybody knows some one thing, and is
glad to talk upon that one thing. Seek, and you
will find, in this world as well as in the next. See
every thing, inquire into every thing; and you
nlay excuse your curiosity, and the questions you
would ask, which otherwise might be thought impertinent, by your manner of asking them; for
most things depend a great deal upon the manner.
As for example, I am afraid that Ianm very troublesome with my questions, but nobody can inform me
as well as you; or something of that kind.
Now that you are in a Lutheran country, go to
their churches, and observe the manner of their
public worship: attend to their ceremonies, and
inquire the meaning and intention of every one of
them. And as you will soon understand German
well enough, attend to their sermons, and observe
their manner of preaching. Inform yourself of
their church government: whether it resides in
the sovereign, or in consistories and synods;
whence arises the maintenance of their clergy;
whether from tithes, as in England, or from voluntary contributions, or from pensions from the state.
Do the same thing when you are in Roman Catholic countries; go to their churches, see all their
ceremonies; ask the meaning of them, get the
terms explained to you. As for instance; prime,
tierce, sexte, nones, matins, angelus, high mass,
vespers, complines, &amp;c. Inform yourself of their
several religious orders, their founders, their rules,
their vows, their habits, their revenues, &amp;c. But
when you frequent places of public worship, as I
would have you go to all the different ones you
meet with, remember, that however erroneous,

then, to lay down instructions for a learner, which
are only fit for a master of eloquence?
We may go farther, and assert, that we ought
to write better than we speak, even though we
should speak well. In actual conversation, our
hearers are often hurried away by the warmth and
rapidity of utterance: many faults pass unobserved; others vanish in an instant, or are lost in the
quick succession of new objects; even such of
them as may happen to strike our hearers, if they
are not too gross, are readily pardoned, as being
the unstudied language of the moment. But when
we write, we are supposed to have more time to
select, to arrange, and to compress; our words
have no longer any wings to fly away from observation: litera scripta manet; every tittle becomes
a steady object of regard; and we may be.assured
that the reader will not forgive our careless and
wanton abuse of his time and patience. Instead
of such vague precepts, it will therefore be much
better to lay before the pupil some examples, to
illustrate the importance of pleasing those to whom
he may have occasion to address himself, either in
conversation or by letter. Let him  know, that
when he writes what is to be sent to another, he
is drawing a picture of his own mind, and that he
ought to be desirous of rendering it an agreeable
likeness. But before he attempts to produce beauties, let him learn to avoid faults. Let him not
aim at facility, till he can write with correctness.
The appearance of study and caution is very allowable in his first essays. After he has acquired
the habit of being regular and exact, frequent practice and a little instruction will make him master
of that seeming ease and simplicity, which are so
much admired in the epistolary style.218       THE PARLOUR LETTER-WRITER.
they are none of them objects of laughter and ridicule. Honest error is to be pitied, not ridiculed.
The object of all the public worships in the world
is the same: it is that great Eternal Being, who
created every thing. The different manners of
worship are by no means subject of ridicule. Each
sect thinks its own the best, and I know no infallible judge in this world to decide which is the
best. Make the same inquiries wherever you are,
concerning the revenues, the military establishment, the trade, the commerce, and the police of
every country; and you should do well to keep a
blank paper-book, which the Germans call an album; and there, instead of desiring, as they do,
etery fool they meet with to scribble something,
write down all these things as soon as they come
to your knowledge from good authority.
I had almost fbrgotten one thing, which I would
recommend as an object of curiosity and information; that is, the administration of justice, which,
as it is always carried on in open court, you may,
and I would have you, go see it with attention and
inquiry.
I have now but one anxiety left, which is concerning you. I would have you be, what I know
nobody is, perfect. As this is impossible, I would
have you as near perfection as possible. I know
nobody in a fairer way towards it than yourself, if
you please. Never were so much pains taken for
anybody's education as for yours; and never had
anybody those opportunities of knowledge and improvement which you have had, and still have. I
hope, I wish, I doubt, and I fear alternately. This
only am I sure of, that you will prove either the
greatest pain, or the greatest pleasure of Yours.LETTERS OF ADVICE.

February 22d, 18-.
Dear Boy-Every excellency, and every virtue,
has its kindred vice and weakness; and if carried
beyond certain bounds, sinks into the one or the
other. Generosity often runs into profusion, econorny into avarice, courage into rashness, caution
into timidity, and so on: insomuch that I believe
there is more judgment required, for the proper
conduct of our virtues, than for avoiding their opposite vices. Vice, in its true light, is so deformed,
that it shocks us at first sight, and would hardly
ever seduce us if it did not at first wear the mask
of some virtue. But virtue is in itself so beautiful,
that it charms us at first sight; engages us more
and more upon farther acquaintance, and as with
other beauties, we think excess impossible; it is
here that judgment is necessary, to moderate and
direct the effects of an excellent cause. I shall
apply this reasoning at present, not to any particular virtue, but to an excellency which, for want of
judgment, is often the cause of ridiculous and
blameable effects; I mean great learning, which
if not accompanied with sound judgment, frequently carries us into error, pride, and pedantry.
As I hope you will possess that excellency in its
utmost extent, and yet without its too common
failings, the hints which my experience can suggest, may probably not be useless to you.
Some learned men, proud of their knowledge,
only speak to decide, and give judgment without
appeal. The consequence of' which is, that mankind, provoked by the insult, and injured by the
oppression, revolt; and in order to shake off the
tyranny, even call the lawful authority in question.
219220       THE PARLOUR LETTER-WRITER.
The more you know, the modester you should be;
and (by the bye) that modesty is the surest way
of gratifying your vanity. Even where you are
sure, seem rather doubtful; represent, but do not
pronounce; and, if you would convince others,
seem open to conviction yourself.
Others, to show their learning, are often, from
the prejudices of a school-education, where they
hear of nothing else, always talking of the Ancients, as something more than men, and of the
Moderns as something less. They are never without a classic or two in their pockets: they stick to
the old good sense; they read none of the modern
trash: and will show you plainly that no improvement has been made, in any one art or science,
these last seventeen hundred years. I would by
no means -have you disown your acquaintance with
the ancients; but still less would I have you brag
of an exclusive intimacy with them. Speak of
the moderns without contempt, and of the ancients
without idolatry; judge them all by their merits,
but not by their ages; and if you happen to have
an Elzevir classic in your pocket, neither show it
nor mention it.
Some great scholars, most absurdly, draw all
their maxims, both for public and private life, from
what they call parallel cases in the ancient authors;
without considering, that in the first place, there
never were, since the creation of the world, two
cases exactly parallel: and, in the next place, that
there never was a case stated, or even known, by
any historian, with every one of its circumstances;
which, however, ought to be known in order to be
reasoned from. Reason upon the case itself, and
the several circumstances that attend it, and act
accordingly; but not from the authority of ancientpoets or historians. Take into your consideration,
if you please, cases seemingly analogous; but take
them as helps only, not as guides. We are really
so prejudiced by our educations, that, as the ancients deified their heroes, we deify their madmen;
of which, with all due regard to antiquity, I take
Leonidas and Curtius to have been two distinguished ones.
And yet a solid pedant would, in a speech in
parliament, relative to a tax of two-pence in the
pound, upon some commodity or other, quote these
two heroes, as examples of what we ought to do
and suffer for our country. I have known these
absurdities carried so far, by people -of injudicious
learning, that I should not be surprised, if some
of thern were to propose, while we are at war with
the Gauls, that a number of geese should be kept
in the Tower, upon account of the infinite advantage which Rome received, in a parallel case, from
a certain number of geese in the capitol. This way
of reasoning, and this way of speaking, will always form a poor politician, and puerile declaimer.
There is another species of learned men, who,
though less dogmatical and supercilious, are not
less impertinent. These are the communicative
and shining pedants, who adorn their conversation,
even with women, by happy quotations of Greel
and Latin; and who have contracted such a familiarity with the Greek and Ronian authors, that
they call them by certain names or epithets denoting intimacy. As old Homer; that sly rogue
Horace; Maro instead of Virgil, and Naso instead
of Ovid. These are often imitated by coxcombs,
who have no learning at all; but who have got
some names and some scraps of ancient authors
by heart, which they improperly and impertinently

retail in all companies, in hopes of passing fo'
scholars; If, therefore, you would avoid the accusation of pedantry on the one hand, or the suspicion
of ignorance on the other, abstain from learned
ostentation. Speak the language of the company
you are in, speak it purely and unlarded with any
other. Never seem wiser, nor more learned, than
the people you are with. Wear your learning like
your watch, in a private pocket; and do not pull
it out and strike it, merely to show that you have
one. If you are asked what o'clock it is, tell it;
but do not proclaim it hourly and unasked like the
watchman.
Upon the whole, remember that learning (I mean
Greek and Roman learning) is a most useful and
necessary ornament, which it is shameful not to
be master of; but, at the same time, most carefully
avoid those errors and abuses which I have mentioned, and which too often attend it. Remember too,
that great modern knowledge is still more necessary than -ancient; and that you had better know
perfectly the present than the old state of Europe;
though I would have you well acquainted with both.
I have this moment received your letter of the

in your present manner of life, yet materials can

Dear Boy-our correspondence has been for some
time suspended by the hurry and dissipation of this
place, which left me no time to write; and it will
soon cease entirely by my return to England, which
will be, I believe, in about a fortnight. I own I am
impatient to see the great progress which I am
persuaded you have made, both in your learning
and behaviour, during my six months' absence. I
join behaviour with learning, because it is almost
as necessary; and they should always go together
for their mutual advantage. Mere learning without good breeding is pedantry, and good breeding
without learning is but firivolous: whereas learning adds solidity to good breeding, and good breeding gives charms and graces to learning.
This place is, without dispute, the seat of true
good breeding; the people here are civil without
ceremony, and familiar without rudeness. They
are neither disagreeably forward, nor awkwardly
bashful and shame-faced; they speak to their superiors with as little concern, and as much ease,
though with more respect, as to their inferiors;
and they speak to their inferiors, with as much
civility, though less respect, as to their superiors.
They despise us, and with reason, for our ill-breeding: on the other hand, we despise them for their

want of learning, and we are in the right of it;
so that you see the sure way to be admired by both
nations, is to join learning and good breeding. As
to learning, consider that you have now but one
year more with Mr. Mattaire, before you go to
Westminster School, and that your credit will depend upon the, place you are put in there at first;
and if you can, at under eleven years old, be put
in the fourth form, above boys of thirteen or fourteen, it will give people very favourable impressions of you, and be of great advantage to you for
the future. As to good breeding, you cannot attend to it too soon, or too much; it must be acquired while young, or it is never quite easy; and
if acquired young, will always last and be habitual. Horace says, " quo semel est imbuta recens
servabit odorem testa diu:" to show the advantage
of giving people good habits and impressions in
their youth. I say nothing to you now as to honour, virtue, truth, and all moral duties, which are
to be strictly observed at all ages, and at all times;
because I am sure you are convinced of the indispensable necessity of practising them all; and of
the infamy as well as the guilt, of neglecting or
acting contrary to any of them. May you excel

Dear Friend--I came to this place on Saturday
night, right well and untired with a seventy miles'
journey. That day I met with your and my
Dolly's joint letter, which wotdd have refreshed me
with its kindness if I had been ever so weary.
The account you give of a certain lady's having entertained a new gallant, in my absence, did
not surprise me; for I have been used to rivals, and
scarce ever had a friend or a mistress in my whole
life, that other people did not like as well as myself. And, thlerefore, I did not wonder whcn I
read in tile newspapers some weeks since, that
" the Dukle of C." (that general lover) " had made
many visits of late to an old lady not many miles
from Craven Street." I only wondered, considering the dislike she used to have for the family,
that she would receive his visits. But as I saw
soon after, that Prince Clarles had left Rome, and
was gone a long journey, nobody knew whither, I

2t7THE ART OF LETTER-IVRITING.      21
One of the greatest faults in a letter is excessive
length. It is much better to be short than to be
flat and tiresome. Young people are very apt to
run into needless details. They write for themselves, without scarcely thinking of the person to
whom they are writing. But in correcting this
fault, the greatest delicacy is to be used. While
you teach them to suppress insipid trifles and frivolous circumstances, take care not to chill the
ardour of their fancy, nor to prune with too severe
a hand the wild luxuriancesof their genius. Quintilian's observations on this head, and the rules
which h1e has laid down for the guidance of every
rational instructor, are not less admirable for their
accuracy than their elegance.

I cannot help having a good opinion of the fertile

I ever dislike superfluities in a young beginner. I
would therefore have a master, like a tender nurse,
indulge the young minds of his pupils in the most
delicious nutriment, suffering them to feast, as it
were, on the sweet milk of eloquence, and to enjoy,
without restraint, the gaiety of florid thoughts and
expressions. Time will soon bring the pampered
body to a due consistence, and will give great
hopes of a sound constitution; whereas the child
that is suddenly formed in all its limbs, portends
future leanness and infirmity. Let boys at an

these may not yet be sufficiently just and accurate.

houses, like those of Nottingham, are built one

manner with trees and gardens. The tower they
call Julius Caesar's, has the same situation with
Nottingham Castle; and I cannot help fancying I
see from it the Trent field, Adboulton, places so
well known to us. It is true, the -fortifications
make considerable difference. All the learned in

them; for my part, that know nothing of the matter, I shall content myself with telling you, it is a

is a tower, very deservedly called the Belvidere,

My dear Wilmot-The speed of our voyage in
the Grenville, by landing us in India some weeks
before the time at which we might have been expected to arrive there, has been productive of one
uncomfortable effect, by making us appear so much
the longer witllout letters from England. Only
one Liverpool vessel has since arrived, which was
not of a date previous to the time of our own sailing, and she brought papers only a very few days
more recent than ours.  Reports, however, have
from time to time been raised, of vessels supposed
from Europe, sccn working up towards Saugor;

which we have, on such occasions, anticipated the

now about to sail again, and I take advantage of
her return to remind those valued friends who
may, possibly, not yet have written to us, how

This is a fine country, and, at this time of the
year, a very fine climate. We hlave, indeed, no
mountains, not even an elevation so high as the
mount in Kensington Gardens, which I recollect
th'e more, because in theil was my last ramble
with yourself and Hay. We have no springs, no
running streams except the Ganges, and we have
not much of open, plain, and dry turf. But we
have wood and water in abundance; the former
of the noblest description of foliage wlhich I have
ever seen, both in form, verdure, variety, and depth
of shadow. I had no idea of the beauty and majesty of an Indian wood: the coloured prints which
I had seen in England being as unlike the sober

by the lanes and hedge-rows round Calcutta. The
mornings, from five to eight, are now equal to the
pleasantest time of year in England; then follow
about eight hours, during which a man does well
to remain in the house, but which, under such circumstances, are not too hot either for comfort or
any kind of mental exertion; and from four to
dark it is again about the temperature of oiur sumn

mer evening. This is, indeed, the best time of
the year. Of the rains and the hlot winds every
body speaks with very alarming eloquence; and I
apprehend that, during their continuance, a bare
existence is all that any man can hope for. We
had some little of these last on our first arrival,
but not sufficient to prevent our morning and
evening airings. They were, however, sufficiently
potent to induce us to believe all which had been
told us of the necessity of cool clothing, cool diet,
and quietness.
Of the people of this country, and the manner
in which they are governed, I have, as yet, hardly
seen enough to form an opinion. I have seen
enough, however, to find that the customs, tlle habits, and prejudices of the former are much nmisunderstood in England. We have all heard, for
instance, of the humanity of the HIindoos towards
brute creatures, their horror of animal food, &amp;c.;
and you may be, perhaps, as much surprised as I
was, to find that those who can afford it are hardly
less carnivorous than ourselves; that even the
purest brahmins are allowed to eat mutton and
venison; that fish is permitted to many castes, and
pork to many others; and that, though they consider it as a grievous crime to kill a cow or bullock for the purpose of eating, yet they treat their
draft oxen, no less than their horses, with a degree
of barbarous severity which would turn an English hackney-coachman sick. Nor have their religious prejudices, and the unchangeableness of
their habits, been less exaggerated. Some of the
best-informed of their nation, with whom I have
conversed, assure me that half their most renlarkao

from their Mohammedan conquerors; and at present there is an obvious and increasing disposition
to imitate the English in every thing, which has
already led to very remarkable changes, and will,
probably, to still more important.  The wealthy
natives now all affect to have their houses decorated with Corinthian pillars, and filled with English furniture. They drive the best horses and
most dashing carriages in Calcutta. Many of
them speak English fluently, and are tolerably
read in English literature; and the children of
one of our friends I saw one day dressed in jacket and trowsers, with round hats, shoes and stockings. In the Bengalee newspapers, of which there
are two or three, politics are canvassed with a bias,
as I am told, inclining to whiggism, and one of
their leading men gave a great dinner, not long
since, in honoul' of the Spanish revolution. Among
the lower orders the same feeling shows itself more
beneficially, in a- growing neglect of caste,-in
not merely a willingness, but an anxiety, to send
their children to our schools, and a desire to learn
and speak English, which, if properly encouraged,
might, I verily believe, in fifty years' time, make
our language what the Oardoo, or court and camlp
language of the country (the Hindoostanee,)'is at
present. And though instances of actual convcrsion to Christianity are, as yet, very uncommon,
yet the number of children, both male and female,
who are now receiving a sort of Christian education, reading the New Testament, repeating the
Lord's Prayer and commandments, and all with the
consent, or at least without the censure, of their
parents or spiritual guides, have increased, during
the last two years, to an amount which astonishes

ble at the name of a missionary, and shrink from tile
common duties of Christianity, lest they should
give offence to their heathen neighbours. So far
from that being a consequence of' the zeal which
has been lately shown, many of the Brahmins themselves express admiration of the Gospel, and profess
to entertain a better opinion of the English since
they have found that they too have a religion and a
Shaster. All that seems necessary for the best effects to follow is, to let things take their course, to
make the missionaries discreet, to keep the government as it now is, strictly neuter, and to place our
confidence in a general diffusion of knowledge,
and in making ourselves really useful to the termporal as well as spiritual interests of the people
among whom we live. In all these points there is,
indeed, great room for improvement. I do not by
any means assent to the pictures of depravity and
general worthlessness which some have drawn of
the Hindoos. They are decidedly, by nature, a
mild, pleasing, and intelligent race; sober, parsimonious, and, where an object is held out to them,
most industrious and persevering. But the magistrates and lawyers all ag-ree, that in no country
are lying and perjury so common, and so little regarded. Notwithstanding the apparent mildness
of their manners, the criminal calendar is generally as full as in Ireland, with gang.robberies, setting fire to buildings, stacks, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and the
number of children who are decoyed aside and
murdered, for the sake of their ornaments, Lord
Amherst assures me, is dreadful. Yet in all-these

tion. In Bengal, at least in this neighbourhood, I
am assured by the missionaries, who, as speaking
the language, and associating with the lower classes, are by fir the best judges, that the English government is popular.  They are, in fact, lightly
taxed (though that taxation is clumsily arranged,
and liable to considerable abuse, from the extortions of the native Aumeens and Chokeydars);
they have no military coinscription, or forced services; they live in great security from the march
of armies, &amp;c.; and, above all, they some of them
recollect in their own country, anid all of them
may hear -or witness in the case of their neighbours in Oude and the Birman crenpire, how very
differently all these things are managed under the
Hindoo and Mohammedan sovereignties.
Olle very wise and liberal measure of government has been, the appropriation of all the internal transit duties to thie construction of roads and
bridges, and the improvement of the towns where
they are levied. A more popular, however, and I
believe better policy, would have been to 1Cremit
those duties altogether. They are precisely the
things in whiclh the Chokeydars, and othcr underlings, are most fiaudulent and oppressive. Twice
as much is extorted by these fellows hleom the poor
country people as tlhey are authorized to receive,
and of what is authorized, only a moderate part
finds its way into t he Company's coffers. Under
such circumstances it might, perhaps, be better to
remove all restraints from internal intercourse and
traffic, to maake the people inidustrious and prosperous, and to be assured that improvements would

forgotten tlhat, without some such settlement, those
improvements would never have taken place at all;
that almost every Zemindary which is brought to
the hammer (and they are pretty numerous) is divided and subdivided, each successive sale, among
smaller proprietors, and that the progress is manifestly going on to a minute division of the soil
among the actual cultivators, and subject to no
other burdens than a fixed and very moderate quitrent, a state of things by no means undesirable in
a nation, and which only needs to be corrected in
its possible excess by a law of primogeniture, and
by encouraging, instead of forbidding, the purchase of lands by the English. On the desirableness of this last measure, as the most probable
means of improving the country and attaching
the peasantry to our government,-I find, in Calcutta, little diffierence of opinion. All the restriction whicl seems necessary is, that the collectors
of the Company's taxes shall not be allowed to
purchase lands within the limits of their districts;
and if the same law were extended to their Hindoo
and Mussulman deputies, a considerable source of
oppression, which now exists, would be dried up
or greatly mitigated.

an intercourse with chaplains, missionaries, and

of my correspondents, without so completely sacrificing all other studies, as I was for some time

houses is the same, with Italian porticoes, and all
whitewashed or stucroed, and the width and
straightness of the principal streets, the want of
pavement, the forms of the peasants' carts, and

I am happy to set you at ease about pirates.
There were, as you have been rightly informed,
four or five years ago, a good many Arab pirates
in the Bombay seas, but none that I have heard of
ever ventured into the bay of Bengal, and even
those who did exist are said to have been completely
driven from the sea by the expedition which was
sent some time back from Bombay against the
Arabs of the Persian gulf. But with these seas I
shall have little concern, since my journeys in that
quarter will be chiefly by land. Those which I
have to perform in this part of India will be mostly
by the Ganges, on which skulking thieves are
sometimes met with, but no robbers bold enough to
attack European boats. I should have much preferred marching by land the whole way, as we at
first proposed, but I found it impossible to leave
Calcutta before the weather would have become
too hot for such a journey. At the commencement
of the rains we shall set out, and boat it all the way
to Cawnpoor. The boats are like houses, and as
comfortable as such things well can be; but our
progress, by this method, will be very tedious and
wearisome, compared with the amusement of a
land journey with our tents and elephants. We
shall, however, escape the rains, which is reckonedTRAVELLERS' LETTERS.
the only unhealthy season in Bengal, when every
road is a puddle, and every field a marsh, and
every river a sea, and when the hot sun, playing
on a vast surface of water and decayed vegetables,
is regarded as the cause of almost all the diseases
which are not brought on by intemperance and
carelessness.
My morning rides are very pleasant; my horse
is-a nice, quiet, good-tempered little Arab, who is
so fearless that he goes, without starting, close to
an elephant, and so gentle and docile, that he eats
bread out of my hand, and has almost as much attachment and coaxing ways as a dog. This seems
the usual character of the Arab horse, who (to
judge from those I have seen in this country,) is
not the fiery dashing animal I had supposed, but
with more rationality about him, and more apparent confidence in his rider, than the generality
of English horses. The latter, however, bear the
highest price here, from their superior size, and
power of' going through more work. The Indian
horses are seldom good, and always ill-tempered
and vicious; and it is the necessity of getting
foreign horses which makes the expense so great
as you have heard, while after all, in this climate,
four horses will not do so much work as a pair in
England.

Your affectionate son.
I rejoice to hear that Mr. Fuller is coming out

be an agreeable and friendly neighbour to us.

March 30, 16-.
Sir-I received two of yours in; Rouen, with
the bills of exchange there inclosed; and according to your directions I sent you those things
which you wrote for.
I am now newly come to Paris, this huge magazine of men, the epitome of this large populous
kingdom, and rendezvous of all foreigners. The
structures here are indifferently fair, though the
streets generally foul all four seasons of the year;
which I impute first to the position of the city,
being built upon an isle (the Isle of France, made
so by the branching and serpentine course of the
river of Seine), and having some of her suburbs
seated high, the filth runs down the channel, and
settles in many places within'the body of the city,
which lies upon a flat; as also for a world of
coaches, carts, and horses of all sorts, that go to
and fro perpetually, so that sometimes one shall
meet with a stop half a mile long of those coaches,
carts, and horses, that can move neither forward
nor backward, by reason of some sudden encounter
of others coming a cross-way; so that often times
it will be an hour or two before they can disentangle. In such a stop the great Henry was so
fatally slain by Ravillac. Hence comes it to pass,
that this town (for Paris is a town, a city, and an
university) is always dirty, and it is such a dirt,
that by perpetual motion is beaten into such black,
unctuous oil, that where it sticks no art can wash
it off of some colours; insomuch, that it may be
no improper comparison to say, that an ill name is
like the crot (the dirt) of Paris, which is indelible;TRAVELLERS' LETTERS.
besides the stain this dirt lcaves, it gives also so
strong a scent, that may be smelt many miles off,
if the wind be in one's face as he comes from the
fresh air of the country; this may be one cause
why the plague is always in some corner or other
of this vast city, which may be called, as once
Scythia was, vagina populorum, or (as mankind
was called by a great philosopher) a great molehill of ants; yet I believe this city is not so populous as she seems to be, for her form being round
(as the whole kingdom is) the passengers wheel
about, and meet oftener than they used to do in
the long continued streets of London, which makes
London appear less populous than she is indeed;
so that London for length (though not for latitude),
including Westminster, exceeds Paris, and hath in
Michaelmas term more souls moving within her
in all places. It is under one hundred years that
Paris is become so sumptuous and striong in buildings; for her houses were mean, until a mine of
white stone was discovered hard by, which runs
in a continued vein of earth, and is digged out
with -case, being soft, and is between a white clay
and chalk at first: but being pulleyed up with the
open air, it receives a crusty kind of hardness, and
so becomes perfect free-stone; and before it is sent
up from the pit, they can reduce it to any form:
of this stone the Louvre, the king's palace, is built,
which is a vast fabric, for the gallery wants not
much of an Italian mile in length, and will easily
lodge 3000' men; which, some told me, was the
end for which the last king made it so big; that,
lying at the fag-end of this great multinous city,
if she perchance should rise, the king might pour
out of the Louvre so many thousand men unawares
into the heart of her.

From the Same to another Friend.
May 12th, 16-.
I am to set forward this week for Spain, and if
I can find no commodity of embarkation at St.
Maloes, I must be forced to journey it all the way
by land, and clamber up the huge Pyrenee hills;
but I could not bid Paris adieu, till I had conveyed my true and constant respect to you by this
letter. I was yesterday to wait upon Sir Herbert
Crofts at St. Germains, where I-met with a French
gentleman, who, amongst other curiosities which
he pleased to show me up and down Paris, brought
me to that place where the late king was slain,
and to that where the marquis of Ancre was shot;
and so made me a punctual relation of all the circumstances of those two acts, which in regard
they were rare, and I believe two of the notablest
accidents that ever happened in France, I thought
it worth the labour to make you partaker of some
part of his discourse.
France, as all Christendom besides (for there
was then a truce betwixt Spain and the Hollanders), was in a profound peace, and had continued
so twenty years together, when Henry IV. fell
upon some great martial design, the bottom whereof' is not known to this day; and being rich (for
he hlad lheaped up in the Bastile a mount of gold247
TRAVELLERS' LETTERS.
that was as high as a lance), he levied a huge
army of 40,000 men, whence came the song,
"The King of France with forty thousand
men;" and upon a sudden he put his army in perfect equipage, and some say he invited our Prince
Henry to come to him to be a sharer in his exploits. But going one afternoon to the Bastile, to
see his treasure and ammunition, his coach stopped suddenly, by reason of some colliers and other
carts that were in that street; whereupon one Ravillac, a lay jesuit (who had a whole twelve-month
watched an opportunity to do the act), put his foot
boldly upon one of the wheels of the coach, and
with a long knife stretched himself over their
shoulders who were in the boot of the coach, and
reached the king at the end, and stabbed him right
in the left side to the heart, and pulling out the
fatal steel he doubled his thrust, the king with a
ruthful voice cried out, Je suis blesse (I am hurt),
and suddenly the blood gushed out at his mouth.
The regicide villain was apprehended, and command given that no violence should be offered him,
that he might be reserved for the law, and some
exquisite torture. The queen grew half distracted
hereupon, who had been crowned queen of France
the day before in great triumph; but in a few
days after she had something to countervail, if not
to overmatch, her sorrow; for according to St.
Lewis's law, she was made queen-regent of France,
during the king's minority, who was then but about
ten years of age. Many consultations were held
how to punish Ravillac, and there were some Italian physicians that undertook to prescribe a torment, that should last a coinstant torment for three
days; but he escaped only withl this-his body

pie of vine-dressers may not in this respect be inapplicable to masters. They do not prune the vine,
while its branches are tender, naturally supposing
that it dreads the knife, and cannot yet endure the
least wound. A teacher should act with the same
delicacy, and should know that remedies, harsh in
their nature, require to be mitigated by something
gentle. Some parts of his pupil's composition he
may praise ~ for others he may make a little allowance: this he may alter, giving a reason why he
does so; and that he may embellish, by introducing something of his own. It will be also sometimes of service to dictate the chief parts of a
subject, which the pupil may copy and enlarge
upon, and thus be deceived into the flattering and
encouraging idea, that it is a work of his own
production. But should his style happen to be so
faulty as not to admit of correction, in this case it
was customary with me to have recourse to an expedient, which I always found successful. I went
over the same subject again, and having explained
it in all its parts, I advised him to work it up anew,
for that he was capable of doing it still better.
The hope of success was a great incentive to his
study and exertions. Others are to be treated differently, but all according to their age and capacity. It was usual with me to tell boys, whose
essays were too bold or too fanciful, that for the
present I was pleased with such flights of genius;
but that the time would come when I should not
indulge them in the like liberties. By this treatment they prided themselves in their wit, and were
not deceived in their judgment.'"

hear hIis bones crack, and after the dislocation they
were set again; and so he was carried in a cart,
standing half naked, with a torch in that hand
which had committed the murder, and in the place
where the act was done it was cut off, and a gauntlet of hot oil was clapped upon the stump to staunch
the blood; whereat he gave a doleful shriek: then
was he brought upon a stage, where a new pair
of boots was provided for him, half filled with
boiling oil; then his body was pincered, and hot
oil poured into the holes. In all the extremity of
this torture he scarce showed any sense of pain;
but when the gauntlet was clapped upon his arm,
to staunch the flux at that time of reeking blood,
he gave a shriek only. He bore up against all
these torments about three hours before he died.
All the confession that could be drawn from him
was, That he thought to have done God good service, to take away that king. which would have
embroiled all Christendom in an endless war.
A fatal thing it was that France should have
three of her kings come to such violent deaths in
so short a revolution of time. Henry II., running
at tilt with M. Montgomery, was killed by a splinter of a lance that pierced his eye; Henry III. not
long after was killed by a young friar, who, in lieu
of a letter which he pretended to have for him,
pulled out of his long sleeve a knife, and thrust it
into his body, and so dispatched him; but that regicide was hacked to pieces in the place by the
nobles. The same destiny attended the king by
Ravillac, which is become now a common name
of reproach and infamy in France.

market town but hath him erected in the market
place, or over some gate, not upon sign-posts, as
our Henry VIII.; and by a public act of parliament, which was confirmed in the consistory at
Rome, he was entitled Henry the Great, and so
placed in the temple of Immortality. A notable
prince he was, and of an admirable temper of body
and mind; he had a graceful facetious way to gain
both love and awe: he would be never transported
beyond himself with choler, but he would pass by
any thing with some repartee, some witty strain,
wherein he was excellent. I will instance in a few
which were told me from a good hand. One day
he was charged by the duke of Bouillon to have
changed his religion, he answered, "No, cousin, I
have changed no religion, but an opinion:" and
the cardinal of Perron being by, he enjoined him
to write a treatise for his vindication: the cardinal
was long about the work, and when the king asked
from time to time where his book was, he would
still answer him, That he expected some manuscripts from Rome before he could finish it. It
happened, that one day the king took the cardinal
along with him to look on his workmen and new
buildings at the Louvre; and passing by one corner which had been a long time begun, but left
unfinished, the king asked the chief mason why
that corner was not all this while perfected? " Sir,
it is because I want some choice marble."--" No,
no," said the king,-looking upon the cardinal, " it
is because thou wantest manuscripts from Romne."
Another time when at the siege of Amiens, he having sent for the Count of Soissons (who had 100,000
francs a year pension from the crown to assist him
in those wars,) and that the count excused himself
by rsason of his years and poverty, having exhaust249250     TIIE PARLOUR LE'rTEl-WRITER.
ed himself in the former wars, and all that he
could do now was to pray for his majesty, which
he would do heartily: this answer being brought
to the king, he replied, " Will my cousin, the Count
of Soissons, do nothing else but pray for me? tell
him, that prayer without fasting is not available;
therefore I will make my cousin fast also from his
pension of 100,000 per annum."
He was once troubled with a fit of the gout;
and the Spanish Ambassador coming then to visit
him, and saying he was sorry to see his majesty
so lame, he answered, " As lame as I am, if there
were occasion, your master the king of Spain
should no sooner have his foot in the stirrup but
he should find me on horseback."
By these few you may guess at the genius of
this sprightly prince: I could make many more
instances, but then I should exceed the bounds of
a letter. When I am in Spain you shall hear further from me; and if you can think on any thing
wherein I may serve you, believe it, sir, that any
employment from you shall be welcome to your
much obliged servant.

My dear Tom-I had no sooner set foot upon
this soil, and breathed Spanish air, but my thoughts
presently reflected upon you; of all my friends in
England, you were the first I met here; you were
the prime object of my speculation; methought
the very winds in gentle whispers did breathe out
your name- and blow it on mne; you seemed to reverberate upon me with tile beams of tile sun,TRAVELLERS' LETTERS.
which you know hath such a powerful influence,
and indeed too great a stroke in this country. And
all this you must ascribe to the operations of love,
which has such a strong virtual force, that when
it fasteneth upon a pleasing subject, it sets the
imagination in a strange fit of working, it employs
all the faculties of the soul, so that not one cell in
the brain is idle; it busieth the whole inward man;
it affects the heart, amuseth the understanding'; it
quickeneth the fancy, and leads the will as it were
by a silken thread to co-operate them all; I have
felt these motions often in me, especially at this
time that my memory is fixed on youi. But the
reason that I fell first upon you in Spain was, that
I reimember I had heard you often discoursing how
you have received part of your education here,
which brought you to speak the language so exactly well. I think often of the relations I have
heard you make of this country, and the good instruction you pleased to give me.
I am now in Barcelona, but the next week I intend to go on through your town of Valentia to
Alicant, and thence you shall be sure to hear from
me further, for I make account to winter there.
The Duke of Ossuna passed by here lately, and
having got leave of grace to release some slaves,
he went aboard the Cape galleys, and passing
through the churma of slaves, he asked divers of
them what their offences were; every one excused
himself; one saying, That he was put in out of
malice, another by bribery of the judge, but all of
them unjustly; among the rest there was one little sturdy black man, and the Duke asking him
what he was in for, " Sir," said he, " I cannot deny
but I am justly put in here, for I wanted money,
and so took a purse hard by Tarragone, to keep

he had in his hand, gave him two or three blows
upon the shoulders, saying, " You rogue, what do
you do amongst so many honest innocent men?

freed, and the rest remained still in statu quo prius,

wind blow from the shore, he may smell this soil

the strong odoriferous scent it casts. As it is the
most pleasant, so it is also the most temperate clinice

thousands were disterred and banished hence to
Barbary, to think that paradise was in that part

others, there is the temple dedicated to Venus. No

I am now (thanks be to God) come to Alicant,
the chief rendezvous I aimed at in Spain; for I am
to send hence a commodity called barilla to Sir
Robert Mansel, for making of crystal glass; and
I have treated with Signior Andriotti, a Genoa
merchant, for a good round parcel of it, to the value of 2,0001. by letters of credit from master Richant; and upon his credit I might have taken
many thousand pounds more, he is so well known
in the kingdom of Valentia. This barilla is a
strange kind of vegetable, and it grows nowhere
253254       TIlE PARLOUIR LETTER-WRITER.
upon the surface of the earth in that perfection, as
here. The Venetians have it hence, and it is a
commodity whereby this maritime town doth partly subsist; for it is an ingredient that goes to the
making of the best Castile soap. It grows thus:
It is a round thick earthly shrub that bears berries
like barberries, betwixt blue and green; it lies
close to the ground, and when it is ripe they dig
it up by the roots, and put it together in cocks,
where they leave it to dry many days like hay;
then they make a pit of a fathom deep in the earth,
and with an instrument like one of our prongs,
they take the tuffs and put fire to them, and when
the flame comes to the berries, they melt and dis.
solve into an azure liquor, and fall down into the
pit till it be full; when they dam it up, and some
days after they open it, and find this barilla juice
turned to a blue stone, so hard that it is scarcely
malleable; it is sold at one hundred crowns a ton,
but I had it for less. There is also a spurious
flower called gazull, that grows here, but the glass
that is made of that is not so resplendent and clear.
I have been here now these three months, and most
of my food hath been grapes and bread, with other
roots, which have made me so fat that I think if
you saw me you would hardly know me, such nutriture this deep sanguine Alicant grape gives. I
have not received a syllable from you since I was
in Antwerp, which transforms me to wonder and
enlgenders odd thoughts of jealousy in me, that as
my body grows fatter, your love grows lanker towards me. I pray take off these scruples, and let
me hear from you, else it will make a schism in
friendship, which I hold to be a very holy league,
and no less than a piacle to infringe it; in which
opinion I rest your constant friend.MISCELLANEOUS LETTERS.

Dear Mary-Ever since I have been out of my

doubt you must have perceived my passion was
sincere. Indeed, Mary, I am continually thinking
about you, and I find it impossible to express how
dearly I love you..I have often designed to do so,
but was always afraid to open my mind when an
opportunity presented itself.  However, I have
now done so, and I hope you will not be cruel to
me, as I am sure I could never live to see you in

You know that I am sober, and that I can earn
nine dollars a week, which, added to what I have
saved, will enable us to live with comfort. I hope
you will duly consider this, and consent to be mine,
or I must be miserable for life.

you ever lose sight of your present sober habits,
and become a drunkard; or should you, as many
wicked husbands have done, treat me ill after you
have got me; then, dear James, I should soon
break my poor heart. So do consider, I beseech
you, before you finally decide upon our union; for
indeed I could never live to be ill treated by you,
or to see the poor babes we may bring into existence, consigned to ruin by their father. Observe,
I by no means desire to attribute such conduct to

of correcting their first compositions, tlhat I cannot hlelp conjuring every teacher to impress those
precepts strongly upon his mind; to enter into the
spirit of them; to make them the rule of his conduct; and not to set up his own vain and fanciiful
opinions against the experience and authority of
the first of masters. There is no part of his subject which Quintillian has discussed with greater
ability, or recommended with greater earnestness,
than this; and let it be remembered, that all men
of taste and judgment concur in acknowledging
his Institutes to be not only the best written, but
the most instructive, and the most useful work, on
the art of training youth to eloquence, that ancient

The remarks here made on the propriety of encouraging the early effusions of genius, are by no
means inconsistent with the introductory caution
against prolixity. The latter is owing to silliness,
or to want of thought: but instances of the former
sort are proofs of a rich and vigorous mind, lavish
of its wealth, and exulting in the display of its
powers. All that need be done, therefore, is to
check the young writer when he begins to trifle.

My uncle perused your letter, and, like his nephew, is more fascinated with you than ever. He
truly says, that in possessing such a wife, I shall
be happier than I deserve.
Every thing being therefore determined, I shall

The Young Woman's Answer.
June 7th, 18-.
Dear Sir-Your affectionate letter demands an
immediate answer; I can- only say, that your
wishes shall be mine, and I trust no part of my
conduct will cause you to regret the distinction
you have conferred upon me, and which I certainly had no reason to expect. However, it shall be
my constant study faithfully to discharge the duties of that station to which you, with unexampled
love, are about to elevate me.
I have shown your affectionate letter to my
kind parents, who have only their prayers and
blessings to present us with. They are delighted
with the warmth of your love; yet, like myself,
they are fearful, lest you overlcok the disparity
between us. However, the whole I can do is to
redouble my exertions in the promotion of your
interest, and in that way endeavour to make up to
you for my want of fortune.
I have only to add, my dear sir, that I shall be
glad to receive- you at the time you have thought
proper to mention.
With grateful respects to your excellent uncle,
Believe me ever to be
Your faithful and too happy.

Respected Madam-I trust you will excuse the
liberty I take in intruding on your notice; but
your known kindness, and the pressure of a large
family, together with my natural anxiety to promote their welfare, have induced me to trouble
you. I have, madam, four daughters, the eldest
is seventeen, and the next fifteen; they are good,
handy girls, brought up to habits of industry, and
anxious to assist, by their own exertions, towards
their own maintenance. Could you kindly recommend them, or either of them, to any lady of your
acquaintance, they would make, I doubt not,
good servants. I should feel the obligation to
the latest moment of my life; and I am sure

August l2th, 18-.
Dear Daughter-We received your affectionate
letter, and we blessed God for giving us so good a
cliild. It gives us great pleasure to hear you are
so comfortable, and we pray to heaven every night
to enable you to continue your good resolutions.
Behave kindly to the children under your care,
pay the greatest attentions to their little wants,
and, above all, always keep them clean; you will
then make their parents your best friends, and
secure a good character; and that, my dear girl,
is indeed a fortune. Be civil and obliging to your
fellow-servants, but never so familiar as to indulge
in idle gossip; and, whatever you hear or see,
never repeat to any one, either in or out of the
house, any thing that passes, either with or about
your mistress or any one else. In your behaviour
to the other sex, be modest and circumspect; a
very little more than mere civility towards themr
will lead on to familiarities, which, if not timely
checked, may end in your ruin here and hereafter.
But your good conduct at home gives little room
for much fear on this account; still, as New York
is a large place, and the dangers to which young
thoughtless women are exposed, so many and so
various, you cannot be too cautious. Your sisters and brothers return their love to you, and we
all hope to hear from you soon.
With our earnest prayers for your happiness and
success, we remain,

Honoured Sir-I have taken the liberty to write
to you, which I hope you will excuse; I have four
children: my eldest boy is now twelve years of
age; he is a sharp, active lad, anxious to go into
the world, and earn his own living. Should you,
sir, or any gentleman of your acquaintance, be in
want of such a lad, it would be rendering us all a
service, which I hope we should ever remember
with gratitude. He can malie himself useful either
in waiting at table, in cleaning knives and shoes,
running of errands, or attending in the stable; indeed he is handy at most things, either in or out
of the house. I have brought him up to fear God,

Servant in New York.
March 9th, 18-.
D)ear Daughter-We have not heard from you
so long, that we are afraid you are ill, for we would
not willingly think you had forgotten us; your father and myself feel anxious at all times to know
how you go on, and particularly so at present, for
you have arrived at an age when youth generally
think themselves perfectly capable of conducting
themselves with the greatest propriety, when in
fact there is perhaps no time of life at which they
are less capable of doing so. The world is full of
temptations, and in New York, above all parts,
those dangers abound, perhaps under more deceitful, more attractive appearances; but with equal,
if not more dangerous consequences. Pleasure
there puts on her most enticing forms, and old and
young, rich and poor, follow eager in her train. It
is then that youth, particularly females, are in real
danger, and it is then they think they are in least.
But the experience of maturer years will convince
them of this truth; and if they be wise in time,
and be prudent in youth, they may expect to enjoy
an honourable and happy old age. We shall wish
to hear from you as soon as you can find an opportunity; meantime I remain, with sincere wishes
for your happiness and welfare,

much or lose sight of my duty in such a manner
as to give you any real cause of uneasiness. My

regularity and of just connexion. When people
write at random, and without a previous consideration of the subject, they often mention that first
which should be reserved for the last; they separate parts which should be united, and unite those
w7hich should be separated; they forget many material circumstances in their proper place, and then
awkwardly introduce them in the shape of afterthoughts. Ally instance of this kind must not be
overlooked even in one's earliest attempts. He must
be, accustomed, from the very beginning, to think
seriously of his subject before he takes the pen in
hand; to draw up in his own mind a distinct plan
of the whole; and to arrange its several parts with
propriety. They must be adapted to each other;
their union must be close; and if various matters
are introduced in the same letter, the transitions
should be clear and easy. Order is visible in all the
works of nature; it is not less requisite in every
production of art. A loose, indigested manner of
writing betrays a false taste, a narrow conception,
or an unpardonable negligence.
A disregard of the nice distinctions of character is another fault, to which young persons are
very liable. It is not enough to consider well the
nature of the subject on which we are going to
write: we should be no less attentive to the rank,
fortune, and temper of the persons with whom we
correspond. A proper sense of their station and
character, and of the relation in which we stand
to them, will assist and direct us in what we ought
to say, and the manner of saying it. They are
our superiors, our equals, or our inferiors: we are
upon a footing of familiarity, or of bare politeness; they are well known to us, or perhaps entire
strangers. In short, the nature of our intercourse

From an English Nobleman to his Son.
November 1st, 17-.
Dear Boy-Let us return to oratory, or the art
of speaking well; which should never be entirely
out of your thoughts, since it is so useful in every
part of life, and so absolutely necessary in most.
A man can make no figure without it in parliament, in the church, or in the law; and even in
common conversation, a man that has acquired an
easy and habitual eloquence, who speaks properly
and accurately, will have a great advantage over
those who speak incorrectly and inelegantly.
The business of oratory, as I have told you be..
fore, is to persuade people; and you easily feel,
that to please people is a great step towards persuading them. You must then, consequently, be
sensible how advantageous it is for a man who
speaks in public, whether it be in parliament, in272      THE PARLOUR LETTER-WRITER.
the pulpit, or at the bar, (that is, in the courts of'
law,) to please his hearers so much as to gain their
attention; which he can never do without the help
of oratory. It is not enough to speak the language
he speaks in, in its utmost purity, and according
to the rules of grammar; but he must speak it
elegantly; that is, he must choose the best and
most expressive words, and put them in the best
order. He should likewise adorn what he says by
proper metaphors, similes, and other figures of
rhetoric; and he should enliven it, if he can, by
quick and sprightly turns of wit. For example,
suppose you had a mind to persuade Mr. Maittaire
to give you a holiday, would you bluntly say to
him'Give me a holiday?' That would certainly
not be the way to persuade him to it. But you
should endeavour first to please him, and gain his
attention, by telling him, that your experience of
his goodness and indulgence, encouraged you to
ask a favour of him; that if he should not think
proper to grant it, at least you hoped he would not
take it ill that you asked it. Then'you should tell
him, what it was tlat you wanted; that it was a
holiday; for which you should give your reasons,
as, that you had such or such a thing to do, or such
a place to go to. Then you might urge some arguments why he should not refuse you; as, that you
have seldom asked that favour, and that you seldom
will; and that the mind may sometimes require a
little rest from labour, as well as the body. This
you may illustrate by a simile; and say, that as
the bow is the stronger for being sometimes unstrung and unbent; so the mind will be capable
of more attention, for being now and then easy
and relaxed.MISCELLANEOUS LETTERS.
This is a little oration, fit for such a little orator
as you; but, however, it will'make you understand
what is meant by oratory and eloquence; which
is, to persuade. I hope you will have that talent
hereafter in great matters.
From the Same to the Same.
April 14th, 17--.
Dear Boy-If you feel half the pleasure from
the consciousness of doing well, that I do from the
information I have lately received in your favour,
from Mr. Harte, I shall have little occasion to exhort or admonish you any more to do what your
own satisfaction and self-love will sufficiently
prompt you to. Mr. Harte tells me that you attend, that you apply to your studies; and that, beginning to understand, you begin to taste them.
This pleasure will increase and keep pace with
your attention; so that the balance will be greatly
to your advantage. You may remember, that I
have earnestly recommended to you, to do what
you are about, be that what it will; and to do nothing else at the same time. Do not imagine that
I mean by this that you should attend to and plod
at your book all day long; far from it: I mean
that you should have your pleasures too; and that
you should attend to them, for the time, as much
as your studies; and if you do not attend equally
to both, you will neither have improvement nor
satisfaction from either. A man is fit-for neither
business nor pleasure, who either cannot or does
not command and direct his attention to the present object, and in some degree banish, for that
time, all other objects firom his thoughts. If at a

ball, a supper, or' a party of pleasure, a man were
to, be solving in his own mind a problem in Euclid,
he would be a very bad companion, and make a
very poor figure in that company; or if in studying a problem in his closet he were to think of a
minuet, I am apt to believe he would make a very
poor mathematician. There is time enough for
every thing in the course of the day, if you do but
one thing at once; but there is not time enough
in the year, if you will do two things at a time.
The pensionary De Witt, who was torn to pieces in
the year 1662, did the whole business of the republic, and yet had time left to go to assemblies in
the evening, and sup in company. Being asked
how he could possibly find time to go through so
much business, and yet amuse himself in the evenings as he did; he answered there was nothing so
easy; for that was only doing one thing at a time,
and never putting off anything till to-morrow, that
could be done to-day. This steady and undissipated attention to one object, is a sure mark of a
superior genius; as hurry, bustle, and agitation,
are the never-failing symptoms of a weak and
frivolous mind. When you read Horace, attend to
the justness of his thoughts, the happiness of his
diction, snd the beauty of his poetry; and do not
think of Puffendorf de Homine et Cive; and when
you are reading Puffendorf, do not think of Madame
de St. Germain; nor of Puffendorf when you are
talking to Madame de St. Germain.

you part of your losses in Germany; and I consent to his reimbursing you the whole, now I know

with otlhers may be infinitely diversified. All may7
require different modes of address. The least iindecorumn in this respect will often render a letter
ridiculous or offensive.
After a pretty long course of exercise, chiefly
with a view to the correction of those fundamentai
errors, the pupil should be made acquainted with
the remaining beauties and characteristics of the
epistolary style; these are purity, neatness and
simplicity. The two first require but little explanation. The last, though in every body's mouth,
is understood by very few; and as it is of the utmost consequence, I shall presently endeavour to
give clear and accurate ideas of it in the words of
the best letter-writer, if not of the greatest orator,
whose works have been handed down to posterity.
Purity consists in the proper use of such words
and phrases as are said to be of native growth, to
distinguish them from exotics, transplanted from
foreign languages, or raised in the hot-beds of affectation and conceit. If we apply this general character of a pure style to compositions in our own
tongue, we may say that purity requires every
word, every sentence, to be strictly English; that
it will have nothing fetched from abroad, nothing
forced at home, nothing obsolete, nothing newcoined, nothing, in short, but the genuine idiom
of our country, as sanctioned by the practice of
our best writers and speakers.
A multitude of Latin words have, of late years,
been poured in upon us. They may sometimes
have a good effect in the higher species of composition by their expressiveness, or their dignity; but
in letters, or in common discourse, besides the risk
of not being understood, such words give language
an air of pedantry and stiffness, which is extremely278       TIHE PARLOUit LETTER-WRITER.

disgusting. The interlardiilg of our style with
French phrases is still less excusable. The writer,
or speaker, who does so, instead of being admired
for his foreign attainments, is laughed at for his
affectation, or despised for his ignorance of the
copiousness and significancy of his mother tongue.
The great beauty of a pure style is its being plain
and intelligible to every body. It is like a smooth,
limpid stream, on which the eye rests with pleasure, as it can see every thing distinctly to the
bottom. Swift's works are the most perfect models
of this kind of writing to be met with in the English language.
Neatness implies purity and something more. It
is not satisfied, though all the words and phrases
should be plain, clear, and taken from established
use; it farther requires a happy choice of whatever
is most delicate and refined in common conversation. Like purity, it rejects the aid of foreign
ornament; but it wishes to show its native graces
to advantage; at the same time it carefully conceals its desire to please. The words, though well
chosen, are familiar; the figures, if any, are short
and correct, not bold or glowing; the turns are
lively, but natural and unaffected: the sentences
are always clear and sometimes bright, yet never
look as if they had been polished with a file; and
while harshness is avoided at the close of every
period, the cadences are so various as not to excite
the least suspicion of musical nicety. Sir William
Temple's letters abound with examples of this
modest elegance.
Simplicity of style, which includes purity and
neatness, and superadds to both a peculiar excellence of its own, is thus characterized by Cicero,
whose letters are tile best illustration of' his pre.

cepts and remarks. Happily for the English scholar,
Melmoth's translation of those letters retains all
the beauty, the spirit, and the simplicity of the
originals.
" The simple style is void of all elevation, conformable to the laws of custom, and differing from
the common way of speaking rather in reality
than in appearance. For this reason, persons who
are totally unskilled in the art of eloquence fancy
they could readily express themselves in the same
manner. It appears, indeed, at first sight, -very
easy to be imitated, though nothing will be found
less so by him who makes the trial."
"When easy writings,"' says the Guardian, "fall
into the hands of an ordinary reader, they appear
to him so natural and unlaboured, that he immediately resolves to write, and fancies that all he has
to do is to take no pains. Thus he thinks indeed
simply, but the thoughts, not being chosen with
judgment, are not beautiful. He, it is true, expresses himself plainly, but flatly withal. Again,
if a man of vivacity takes it into his head to write
this way, what self-denial must he undergo when
bright points of wit occur to his fancy! How difficult will he find it to reject florid phrases, and
pretty embellishments of style! So true it is, that
simplicity is of all things the hardest to be copied,
and ease to be acquired with the greatest labour."
"Although this kind of writing does not seem
to require any great strength, or body, yet it
should always have such a degree of vigour and
good plight, as may show it to be in -perfect health."
Simplicity is not of a very florid complexion; yet
it never wears a consumptive appearance. Each
thought has its proper extent, and the flow of lanTHE ART OF LETTER-WRITING.
guage is sufficiently kept up, but without any swell,
or redundancy.
"But let us first free it from the shackles of
number."
By the shackles of number, Cicero here means
the strict rules of harmony, a musical distribution
of the parts and pauses, sounding words, and tuneful
periods, all of which are misplaced in a familiar
letter, and totally inconsistent with simplicity.
"We may likewise add, that it is not necessary
to be at the pains to celnent word to word with a
scrupulous exactness: for those breaks, which are
made by the meeting or collision of vowels, have
now and then a good effect, as they discover a
pleasing negligence, and show the writer to be
more solicitous about things than sounds."
In poetry the meeting of vowels has a disagreeable effect, which Pope so well exemplifies in the
very line where he censures that faultTho' oft the ear the open vowels tire.
A hiatus is also to be avoided as much as possible in any piece of regular or elaborate composition in prose. But in a letter, we are apt to
neglect those little attentions, and the more readily,
as we do not seek to close our ranks, in order to
make a single impression by the union of several
forces.
" Being now freed as to what relates to the measured flow and combination of the words, let us
see what it has to observe in other respects. For
though these short and unconnected phrases require
care, yet art should by no means appear. The great
point is to preserve a sort of industrious negligence.
It is with simplicity of style, as with many women
who look best in an undress-always agreeable,

without affecting to appeam,o. Here, therefore, all
the glitter of ornament, like that of jewels and
diamonds, must be laid aside; nor must we apply
even the crisping-iron to adjust the hair. There
must be no paint, no artful washes, to heighten the
complexion; but neatness and elegance must be
our only ainl.
"To render it lively and agreeable, it must be
intermixed with ingenious thoughts that seem to
break upon us unexpectedly."
But as these thouglhts depend on a fruitfulness
of genius, and a peculiar turn of mind, they are
not at every writer's command. Good sense, however, will always supply their place.
" Every advantageous use may also be made of
a nice and delicately seasoned pleasantry. Of this
there are two sorts, one of which is called gaiety,
or humour, and the other consists in what we term
smart sayings, and quick repartees. The first is
employed when we relate an agreeable story, and
the latter in giving or retorting a stroke of ridicule."
We should be extremely reserved on the head
of pleasantry, because it is never good unless well
placed, and it is difficult to hit the mark justly in
a letter, as one shoots at such a distance. As to
sallies of wit, it is still more dangerous to let them
fly at random. Repeat the smart sayings of others,
if you will, or relate part of some droll adventure,
to enliven your letter; but the least fondness for
sarcastic jokes, will expose you to the imputation
of malice.
"All affected witticisms should likewise be avoided, as they are generally cold and insipid.
"Lastly, we should be very cautious how we
employ the treasures of eloquence; I mean thoseTIIE ART OF LETT'ER-Itl'tING.     31
ornaments, of which some consist in the thoughts,
and othcers in the words.
"Such of them   as are too striking must be
avoided, that, if possible, there may not be the
slightest appearance, or even a suspicion, of a desigin to please."
The epistolary style admits all the figures of
words and thoughts, as they are the expressions
of natiure herself; but admits them after its own
manner. It delights in modest grace, but rejects
flourishes. It is not the language of the vulgar;
it is the style of oratory reduced to tlhe level of
common conversation.
Any further remarks on this head may tend to
confuse the young letter-writer. AVith clear ideas
of the principles here laid down, let him read attentively, after this volume, select letters from
Cicero, Sir William  Temple, Swift, Arbuthnot,
Madame de Sevigne, and Lady Mary Wortley
Montague; and let him endeavour by reiterated
essays to approach to their excellence.STYLE OF ADDRESS

ON TITLES AND STYLES OF ADDRESS.
MOST of the abovementioned titles and additions, are such as are customarily used in legal
papers, contracts, commissions, &amp;c.; but courtesy
being more liberal than law, goes much farther,
especially in the use of the term esquire, which
appears to be applied indiscriminately to all men
who pay a capitation tax.
Many persons are accustomed to write honosurable before a man's name, and esquire after it. But
this seems to be ascribing different ranks to the
same person at the same time; and is, therefore,
in bad taste. So, indeed, is the accumulation of
titles and additions to a name in any case.  In
addressing to a person holding office, any documellt or paper having reference to that office, it is
strictly proper and in good taste, to write out in
full, after his name, the title belonging to him in
tile character in which he is addressed. But in all
letters on private business, friendship, or any of
the common affairs of life, it is proper and becoming to use a very simple and modest style of address, as 3Mri. A. B.; or, if the law awards him that
designation, A. B. Esq. Any more exalted title
in an ordinary letter, is seldom preferred by a man

IT is said that Addison, certainly one of the most
accomplished writers of the English language, was
once completely nonplussed, upon being required to
write suddenly a ceremonious address to some dignitary, in virtue of his office of under Secretary of State.
A very inferior man, who was well acquainted with
the nature of parliamentary business, tooli the pen
from his hand, and dashed off in tTwo minutes, precisely
the thing that was wanted, and to produce which, the
accomplished Secretary had laboured, erased, corrected, and cogitated in vain.
This anecdote illustrates the necessity of a technical
acquaintance with the proper forms and modes of address for ~various persons, occasions and circumstances
in life. The lawyer has his forms of petition and address, the ambassador his forms of protocols and letters,
the commanding general his forms of orders and dispatches--in short, the most distinguished actors on the
great stage of life address each other under certain
restrictions of form and ceremony, which are as invariable as they are necessary to the correct dispatch
of business. The same general principle is applied in
the humbler walks of life, and the merchant, farmer,
and mechainic, the father and mother, son and daughter

Demanding an immediate Payment of a Sum of
Money.
Philadelphia, June 1st, 18-.
Sir-A severe pressure in pecuniary matters
compels me to address you in a manner which may
not perhaps be pleasing.
The sum you are indebted to me ought, in justice, to have been paid six months since, from
which period you have constantly trifled with me,
by offering trivial excuses.
You must be aware, that I cannot possibly carry
on my business, and pay my creditors punctually,
unless regular returns are made to me; and I have
only to add, that unless you send me a remittance,
I must (however reluctantly I may do it) pursue
other means for the recovery of my due.
I shall conclude, sir, by recommending you, if
you are anxious to prosper in trade, to be diligent
in your business, and, above all things, to be punctual in the payment of your bills.

you that unavoidable circumstances (on my part)
have alone prevented me from discharging your

The fact is, I could not collect the money due
from the little shopkeepers whom I supply, and to
whom I am compelled to give long credit. I have
now, however, received some bills, in consequence
of which you will find inclosed an order on my

not be withheld under present circumstances.
Messrs. Wilson and Parker, the executors of my

me two-thirds of the above sum; and pardon me,
sir, when I state that I have sanguine hopes that,
upon due consideration, you will not allow such

Sir-Owing to a general failure of my crops, and
a great mortality amongst my cattle, I am compelled to solicit time for the payment of my rent;
and as the winter is now approaching, I fear it will
not be in my power to make any payment until the
commencement of the Spring quarter. As you
must be well aware that my inability to settle with
you originated with the very bad season which we

me punctual in the discharge of my rent, I have

From a Young Man wishing to commence Business, to a rich Relative.
October 7th- 18--.
My dear and respected Sir-Having served my
time to Mr. Shelby, the mercer, I am anxious to
commence business upon my own account, but
this will be utterly impracticable, unless you will
condescend to afford me your assistance, which I
am induced to hope you will, from the circumstance
of your frequent approbation of my conduct while
an apprentice, and the whole tenor of your conduct
towards me.
You are -aware, honoured sir, of my circumstances; consequently must know that I am not
possessed of more than $200 in the world, and that
I have no friend able to assist me, with the exception of yourself.
An opportunity now offers for me to commence
business, with every prospect of success.  Mr.
Jones, a late eminent grocer in this town, being
deceased, the whole of his business, including the
stock in trade, is to be disposed of by private contract, on Tuesday next, by his executors, of whom
I have made proper inquiries, and find the sum required will amount to $700.
Having made this statement, I leave the whole

Dear George-I received your letter, and hasten

own bad conduct shall ever diminish.
I am of opinion that the -prospect which now
opens to your notice, ought not to be neglected, a
circumstance so favourable rarely occurring; I
have, therefore, resolved to give you a marked testimony of my affection towards you, by advancing
you $1000. Thlis sum I freely present you with:
I doubt not, when added to your own little fortune,
it will procure you a comfortable support; and
with careful industry it may, perhaps, in time, enable you to save (as I have done before you, witlhout half your prospects,) a fortune.
Wishing you all possible success, and trusting
that you will ever confide in me,

your advice, confident, should any alternative remain to me, excepting that of bankruptcy, that
your long experience can point it out, which, from
the friendly interest you have avowed, I have no
doubt but you will do.
I find it impossible to. make the necessary returns to the wholesale dealers, (especially to yourself,) yet I am happy to say, my heart acquits me
of having wasted one penny, and my books will
prove that, when it can be received, there will be
an ample sufficiency to liquidate every demand.

Dear Sir-I am sorry to hear of your unpleasant

by the sums due to you, and which doubtless will
be paid in time.
Be therefore easy oi this account, as being your
principal creditor myself, I will arrange matters
with your other creditors.
The only advice: I can offer you is, in future to
be more careful what credit you give, till your circumstances are sufficiently prosperous to enable
you to lay out of large sums of money for a considerable time, when you may safely venture to extend
your trade by giving long credit.LETTERS ON BUSINESS.

Dear Sir-I have most sincerely to thank you
for the kindness I have experienced from you, and
more especially as it was wholly unsolicited on my
part. I had a most ardent wish to unbosom my
mind to some friend, on the circumstances which
have borne heavily on me, both bodily and mentally, but was wholly without confidence as to the
selection I should make, in so trying and delicate
an affair, as I did not conceive myself justified in
the expectation of having so generous and valuable
a friend. At present, dear sir, I can only return
you sentiments of acknowledgment for the very
great obligation under which you have placed me;
and to assure you, that I shall ever cherish a grateful remembrance of this kind and considerate attention.

that it is impossible for one person to superintend

be so long without it, pray refuse me.

Sir--That friendship which we contracted in

Providence has placed us many miles distant from
each other. I have heard of your success in New
York, and it is with pleasure I can assure you
that I am comfortably settled here. But you know
that our returns are slow, and profits small, and
therefore, however willing, I am not in circumstances sufficient to defray the expenses of a journey to town, in order to purchase goods at the

because a considerable expense. Relying, therefore, on your former friendship, I have presumed
to solicit your assistance, to purchase, from time to
time, what goods I may happen to want from the
city, for which an order shall be remitted on delivery. At present I have only sent for a few articles, as you will see by the inclosed. I doubt not

From -a Country Shopkeeper, to a Dealer in Philadelphia, complaining of the Badness of his Goods.
Sir-When I first began to correspond with you,
it was smy fixed resolution to act with integrity
and honour, expecting the same in return. I must,
indeed, confess, that the goods you sent me for
some time were as good as any I could purchase
from another, and so far I had not ally reason to
complain. But now the case is quite different.
The two last parcels you sent me are so bad, that
I dare not offer them to my customers. From
what, sir, does this proceed? Have I ever been
deficient in my payments? No, you dare not accuse me of any thing of that nature. However,
I am obliged to tell you, that unless you send me
others in their room, I must either withdraw my
correspondence, or shut my shop. Your immediate answer will oblige,

to hear the goods sent you were so bad. I knowLETTERS ON BUSINESS.
I had some such, in my warehouse, but was determined to sell them at a low rate, without ever
thinking of their being sent to any'of my customers, particularly so valuable a correspondent as
yourself. By some mistake my servants have in.

sorry; but in order to make you amends, I send
by this day's wagon those which I had originally

From a Tradesman in Reply to a Demand from
one of his Principal Creditors.
Sir--The difficulty I have experienced in obtaining settlements of debts which have been owing to me for a length of time, the bad state in
which business has been in, and the long credit I
am under the necessity of giving, can alone plead
my excuse for not replying earlier to your favour.
Joined to these, my unwillingness to send you any
communication, unless accompanied by a remittance; and which, I find, after the most strenuous
exertions on my part, that I. am unable to accomplish, will, I trust, cause you to hold me excused
of any intentional neglect. I can assure you, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to be able
to send you the full amount of the demand you
have made on me, as I am quite satisfied you
would not make an application of the sort unless
you were actually distressed for the money.-I- am
well aware that I have exeeeded the accustomed
credit; but as this is the first time I have failed in

my promise with regard to money matters, I sincerely trust you will allow me a little longer time,
(say a month from this date) and I will, without
fail, send you the sum required.-Waiting anxously your reply,
I am, sir,
Your faithful servant.
In Reply, and favourable.
Sir-Yours, of the 26th instant, I hasten to reply to.-Well convinced as I am of your integrity,
I should feel ill at ease with myself, if I refused
the extended time you require. I am too well acquainted with- the fluctuations of business, and
the difficulty tradesmen have of obtaining settlements of their accounts, to press harshly upon
them, more especially as I myself have at times
need of lenity on the score of money matters. I
shall, therefore, not write again until I hear from
you, which I shall expect to do in a month or five
weeks at farthest from this date.
Yours very faithfully.
In Reply, unfavourable.
Sir-I have just received yours of the 26th inst.,
and cannot but observe in reply thereto, that I
feel exceedingly disappointed at the statement you
have made. I have depended on receiving the
sum I named, more especially as the time agreed
upon for payment has passed, and I must say that
the inconvenient situation I shall be placed in from
your non-compliance with my request, cannot be
counterbalanced by any remittance you may make

you will let me have $--, at the least, this day
week, otherwise I shall take legal measures for therecovery of the whole sum due to me. I am well
aware that business is far from being brisk, but
young tradesmen ought to be more careful of giving long credit, and more especially when their
capital, like your own, is but small.
I am, sir,
Your obedient servant.
From the Tradesman in Answer.
Sir-The advice, which your letter of yesterday contains, is so pithy, so laconic, and so much
to the purpose, that it cannot fail to have. its due
weight with myself. But after an acquaintance
of - years, during which period some hundreds
of dollars have been paid by me to you, and with
the utmost regularity, I little expected the lectur.
ing you have been pleased to favour me with; but
you may depend on it, sir, I shall never again
place it in your power to school me as to the mode
in which t should conduct my business. I am
only serry that I have laid you under the necessity of refusing so trifling a favour. I beg, there.
fore to inform you that, through the kindness of a
friend, I shall be enabled, on this day weekl, not
only to satisfy the demand you make, but also, at
the same time, to settle the balance which will
then be due to you. If, therefore, you will either
send a receipt, or call yourself, on that day, the account shall be closed, and all correspondence between us on that, or any other subject, ended.
I am, sir, yours, &amp;c.
To a Friend, soliciting a favourfor a Son.
Dear Friend-My family is so numerous, and
the returns in trade latterly falling off, that it is

way of providing for themselves; I shall then have
the pleasure of seeing them in a proper path, and
lessen my domestic expenses, two most essential
points to me and my wife, who is, I am sorry to
observe, in a very weak state of health. Mary is
gone to wait on a lady; Jane is on trial at a dressmaker's; and William, now turned fourteen, does
not like my trade, but has a great fancy to yours.
Nor is there a man under the sun to whom I would
sooner bind him apprentice; and as when I last
saw you, you spoke of taking one, (or an additional
one) I have ventured to make this request. I can
find him in clothes, but the premium, I fear, will
be too small to meet your wishes. You will have
the goodness, however, to let me know your determination as soon as convenient, and it will materially oblige
Your sincere friend and well-wisher.
Requesting a Loan of Money.
If you, my friend, can, without any inconvenience to yourself, lend me the sum of -, for
six weeks, for which I will give my note, you will
confer on me a lasting obligation. My customers
have lately been backward in payment, though I
look on all my book debts as being in fair hands.
But you know most of my affairs.with Gosling &amp;
Co. and I wish to keep up my credit with them;
and if I settle the present demand, they will immediately increase my stock. An answer by the
bearer will greatly oblige,

to serve you, and trusting you will be punctual to
the given time, you may therefore call on me for
that sum this evening, after six; till then I am engaged. If you should meet S-, do not mention the circumstance to him, as yesterday, from
motives of prudence, I refused to cash a bill for
him, though of much less amount than that you
have occasion for.
Yours, in sincere friendship and confidence.
The Denial.
Dear Sir-I regret I cannot acquiesce with the
request contained in your note, for I really am out
of cash, through the late repairs and alterations of
my house, and other causes. I hope my non-compliance will not seriously disappoint you, as you
must have other friends whose ability to serve you
keeps pace with their inclinations; if not, as you
seem to attach great dependence in the responsibility of your book -debts, assign them over to Messrs.
Gosling &amp; Co. who will no doubt send you in
goods as you may require, and arrange as to future
payments from you to their firm.
Yours, &amp;c.
The Tradesman's Reply.
Sir-I do not thank you for your advice, my
affairs not being in that desperate condition as to
require arrangements with my creditors; but I
grieve for the profanation of the sacred name
friendship. Had you not repeatedly offered assistance when I did not require it, I should not have
made the request. You also forget the services I
rendered you when you were at --.  But hold,
it is mean of me to repeat an obligation; nor
would I have done so had not your ingratitude84       TIIE PARLOUPR LETrE;R-WRITER.
stung me; and I am well aware of your power to
befriend me in this temporary embarrassment, but
your littleness of mind prevented you. Yes, sir,
I have met a friend, not another friend, for you are
unworthy the appellation. Thank Heaven, every
man is not a butterfly only to bask in the sunshine of prosperity. You appear to be making
rapid strides towards prosperity, and with the wish
it may continue,
I remain, &amp;c.
From a Gentleman, requesting.the Character of a
Servant.
Sir-I understand from John -, that he had
been (such a time) in your service as -, and
that he is capable of the situation. If his character suits my expectations, and he says he has no
doubt of your recommendation being in his favour
(his only motive), the cause of his dismissal being
(or sentences to the purpose required), I shall certainly engage him, as I like his appearance and civil
deportment. Your answer by the return of the
bearer will much oblige,
Sir, your humble servant.
The Answer.
Sir-It is with pleasure I inform you that my
late servant John, of whose character you do me
the honour to inquire, is a worthy, honest, and
sober young man, and perfectly qualified for that
line of domestic servitude he has chosen; he is clean
in person, and of excellent temper. The reason he
states as to leaving my establishment, and time ofremaining in it, are both correct; and with an earnest wish he may suit you in every respect,
I have, sir, the honour to be, &amp;c.
A different Reply.
Sir-I am sorry to say I cannot recommend
as I could wish; he is a good servant when sober,
but frequent inebriations obliged me to part with
him after repeated admonitions on my part, and
vain promises of amendment on his. Allow me at
the same time to say, I have nothing to allege
against his honesty; and as he has suffered much
by being out of place, he may possibly have become
sensible of his error, and make you a better servant than he has done me. I have, sir, the honour
to remain,
Your obedient servant, &amp;c.
From a Merchant at Leghorn to his Brother in
New York, desiring him to sell some Goods and
purchase others.
Sir--According to the agreement settled between
us-when I left the United States, I have sent, by
the Charming Sally, Captain J., twelve bales of raw
silk, marked A. Z., desiring you to dispose of them
to the best advantage. They are all warranted
good, as I examined each parcel separately before
they were sent on board. You will receive an inclosed order for various articles of American manufactures,:to be sent by the first ship sailing for this
port.. Let them be as good and cheap as possibly
you can procure, as they are much wanted at present.
I am, sir,
Your humble servant.
LETTERS ON BUSINESS.
8586       THE PARLOUR LETTER-WRITER.
The Answer.
Sir--Yours I received, and the bales marked A.
Z., were delivered at the custom-house. I immediately advertised them for sale at Garraway's, in
twelve different lots, but they were all purchased
by an eminent manufacturer for nine hundred dollars, which I have lodged in the bank in your
name. I have likewise shipped on board the Dispatch, Captain W-, the different articles wvhich
you ordered; there are twenty bales, marked B. M.
I am told they are the best that can be had, and
doubt not of their giving satisfaction.
I am, sir,
Your humble servant.
To a Correspondent, requesting the Payment of a
Sum of Money.
Sir-Although the balance of the account between us has been long standing in my favour, yet
I would not have applied to you at present, had not
a very unexpected demand been made upon me for
a large sum, which, without your.assistance, is not
in my power to answer. When I see you, I will
inform you of the nature of this demand, and the
necessity of my discharging it. I hope you will
excuse me this freedom, which nothing but a regard to my credit and family could oblige me to
take. If it does not suit you to remit the whole,
part will be thankfully received by
Your humble servant.
The Answer.
Sir-I have just received yours, and am sorry
to hear of your affliction. That the account between us was not sooner settled, was owing to the
failure of two principal debtors. I have just received
a remittance from Norwich, and am pleased it
is in my power to answer the whole of your demand. The balance between us is two hundred
and fifty dollars, for which I have inclosed an order
on Mr. C, the banker. I hope you will surmount this and every other difficulty, and am

From an Insolvent Debtor to his Principal Creditor, desiring the Acceptance of a Composition.
Sir-When I first entered into business, I little
thought that ever I should be under the necessity
of writing to you on such a subject as this; but
experience has taught me, that it is much better to
acknowledge the state of my affairs to my creditors, than put them to the expense of taking out a
commission of bankruptcy. To you, sir, therefore,
as the person to whom I am principally indebted,
do I address myself on this melancholy occasion,
and must acknowledge, that my affairs are much
deranged. I have been these ten years past endeavouring to acquire something for myself, -but

in vain; for the variety of different articles which
I have been obliged to sell on credit, and the losses
sustained thereby, always kept me in low circumstances; and often, when I paid you money, I had
none left for the support of my family. If you
will be pleased to employ any prudent person to
examine my books, I doubt not but you will be
convinced, that the whole of my conduct has been
consistent with the rules of the strictest honesty;
and, if it shall appear so to you, I must beg you
will be pleased to call a meeting of the creditors,
and lay it before them. I have not spent any more
than was really and absolutely necessary for the
support of my family, and every thing remaining
shall be delivered up. When all this is done, I
hope you will accept it, as it is not in my power
to do more, and consider me as one whose misfortunes call for pity instead of resentment.
I am, sir,
Your humble servant.
The Answer.
Sir-With the greatest concern I have perused
your affecting letter; and should consider myself
as very cruel indeed, if I refused to comply with
a request so reasonable as that made by you. I
have employed a worthy person, a friend of mine,
to examine your books, the result of which shall
be immediately laid before the other creditors, and
if it is as you represent, you need not be afraid of
any harsh usage. I always considered you as one
of the greatest integrity, and am determined to lay
down a plan for your future support. In the mean
time I have sent a trifle to defray your expenses
till the affairs are settled, and am

From a Country Tenant, on the same occasion.
Honoured Sir-I am    extremely sorry that,
through a variety of unforeseen accidents, I am
obliged to write to you on such a subject as this.
The season last year was bad, but I was enabled
to pay you. This has turned out much worse, and
it being so long before we could get the corn home,
it is not yet fit to be sold. I only beg your indulgence about two months longer, whein I hope to
pay you faithfully.
I am, your humble servant.
The Answer.
Sir-From the whole of my conduct, ever since
you first became my tenant, I hope that you cannot have reason to allege any thing against me.
I never treated you with rigour, as I always considered you an industrious; honest man. Make
yourself perfectly easy concerning the payment of

I doubt not but they are, you may be assured of

From a Tradesman to a Wholesale Dealer, to delay
Payment of a Sum of Money.
Sir--My note to you will be payable in ten
days, and I am sorry to inform you that, although
I have considerable sums in good hands, yet none
of them are due these three weeks, which is the
most time I require. It is a favour I never asked
of any one till this moment, and I hope for the
future not to have any occasion to repeat it. I am
really distressed for your answer; but as a proof
of my sincerity, have sent inclosed three notes
subscribed by persons well known to yourself, and
although they exceed my debt, yet I have no objection to your keeping them as security till due.
Let me beg to hear from you as soon as this comes
to hand, which will much oblige,
Your humble servant.
The Answer.
Sir-your letter arrived the day after it was
written, which was extremely fortunate for you, as
I was to have paid your note away yesterday, and
I could not have had an opportunity of recalling
it in time to have served you. Indeed, it was imprudent not to communicate the news to me sooner,
as your credit might have been greatly affected by
such an unnecessary delay. However, I impute
it to your unwillingness to reveal the state of
your affairs, and shall keep the note in my hands
till your own becomes due, and for that purpose
have returned the others, not doubting but you
will send me the money at the time promised,
which will greatly oblige,
Your sincere well-wisher.

carry on trade to ally advantage; that I may be
able to sell my goods as cheap as possible, I would
choose to have them from the first hand, and likewise the usual time of credit. If it is agreeable

My dearest Harriet-Ever since the fatal or auspicious evening that I was introduced to your endearing presence, my heart has been riveted to
the lovely image of her, who must become the arbitress of my future happiness or misery; that the
latter will be the case, will not endure a moment's
reflection, for independent of my own feelings, it
would be cruel to suppose that a bosom formed of
virtues most sensitive and tender, could ever consign a heart touched with those very virtues *to
become the victim of aspiring delusion. -No, my
dear Harriet, you will never overwhelm me with
such a fatal reply, and thus annihilate all those
endearing prospects of future felicity, which I
hlave so ardently cherished; as an alleviation, then,
to those fond feelings, which are at present severely
agitated by suspense, permit me, my dear girl, to
address your respected parents, for a formal recognition of my visits and attentions to you: such
