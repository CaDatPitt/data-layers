RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
N0TE.-mX is read x, or one, and is the same as Ix. 2x is read two x,
or 2 times x..3x is read three x, or 3 times, and so on.
2. What number added to itself will make 12?
Let x represent the number; then x added to x makes 2x, which
is equal to 12; hence if 2x is equal.to 12, one x, which is the half
of 2x, is equal to the half of 12, which is 6.
VERIFICATION.-6 added to 6 makes 12.
3. What number added to itself will make 16?
If x represents the number, what will represent the number
added to itself? What is 2x equal to? If 2x is equal to 16, what
is x equal to?
4. What number.added to itself will make 24?
5. Thomas and William each have the same number of apples,
and they both together have 20; how many apples has each?
6. James is as old as John, and the sum of their ages is 22
years; what is the age of each?
7. Each of two men is to receive the same sum of money for a
job of work, and they both together receive 30 dollars; what is
the share of each?
8. Daniel had 18 cents; after spending a part of them, he found
he had as many left as he had spent; how many cents had he spent?
9. A pole 30 feet high was broken by a blast of wind; the part
broken off was equal to the part left standing; what was the
length of each part?
Instead of saying x added to.x is eqtual to 30, it is more convenient to say xpluts x is equal to 30. To avoid writing the word
pluts, we use the sign +, which means the same, and is called the
sign of addition. Also, instead of writing the word equal, we use
the sign =, which -means the same, and is called the sign of
eqtiality.
10. John, James, and Thomas, are each to have equal shares of
12 apples; if x represents John's share, what will represent the
share of James?   What will represent the share of Thomas?
What expression will represent x+x+x  more briefly. --If 3x=12,
what is the value of x?  Why?
11. The sum of fourn equal numbers is equal to 20; if x represents one of the numbers, what will represent each of the others?
What will represent x+x+x+x, more briefly? If 4x-20, what
is x equal to? Why?

TO MULTIPLY ONE FRACTIONAL QUANTITY BY ANOTHER.
ART. 1139.-To multiply a fraction by an entire quantity, or
an entire quantity by a-fraction.
It is evident, from Prop. I., Art. 122, that in multiplying the
numerator of a fraction by an entire quantity, the fraction is
increased as many times as there are units in the multiplier.
a               2a                         ma
Thus, - taken twice, is -; and taken?n times, is
b                             bsb
Again, when two quantities are to be multiplied together,
either may be made the multiplier (Art. 67); to multiply 4 by 3'
is the same as to multiply; by 4. Or, to multiply nz by b, is the
same as to multiply b by m. Hence, the
RULE,
FOR THE MULTIPLICATION OF A FRACTION BY AN ENTIRE QUANTITY,
OR OF AN ENTIRE QUANTITY BY A FRACTION.
Mlldtiply the nutzerator by the entire quantity, and write the prodzuci over the denominator.
Since (See Art. 125,) dividing the denominator of a fraction
increases the value of the fraction, as many times as there are
units in the divisor, it is evident, that any fraction will be multiplied by an entire quantity, if the denominator of the fraction be
divided by the entire quantity. Thus, in multiplying - by 2, we
may divide the denominator by 2, and the result will be -, which
is the same as to multiply by 2, and reduce the resulting fraction
to its lowest terms. Hence, in multiplying a fraction and an entilre
quantity together, we shoulld always divide the denomninatorof thefraction by the entire quantity, when it can be done without a remainder.
R E 3r A R K.-The expression, " What is two thirds of 6?" has the same
meaning, as "What is the product of 6 multiplied by i?" The reason of
the rule for the multiplication of an entire quantity by a fraction, may be

one third, that is, two thirds of a is 2a  Also, - of a is -, and the - part.3       a       r _

The preceding rule may be derived in another manner, thus:
To divide a number by 2, i's to take a of it, or to multiply it by.;
to divide by 3, is to take 1 of it, or to multiply it by -. In the
same manner, to divide a quantity by m, is to take -of it, or to
multiply it by m  Hence, to divide a fractioin by an entire qtan-n

A complex fraction may also be reduced to a simple one, by
multiplying both terms by the least common multiple of the denominators of the fractional parts of each term.  Thus, we may
reduce 53 to a simple fraction, by multiplying both terms by 6,
the least common multiple of 2 and 3; the result is 2.  In some
cases this is a shorter method, than by division. Either method
may be used.
ART. 144.-Resolution of fractions into series.
An ihfinnite series consists of an unlimited number of terms,
which observe the same law.
The law of a series is a relation existing between its terms, so
that when some of them are known, the succeeding terms may be
easily derived.

Thus, in the infinite series, 1-ax+a2x2--a3x3+a4x4, &amp;c., any
term may be found, by multiplying the preceding term by-ax.
Any,proper algebraic fraction, whose denominator is a polynomial, can, by division, be resolved into an infinite series; for, the
numerator is a dividend, and the denominator a divisor, so related
to each other, that the process of division never can terminate,
and the quotient will, therefore, be an infinite series. After a few
of the terms of the quotient are found, the law of the series will,
in general, be easily seen, so that the succeeding terms may be
found without continuing the division.

EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST DEGREE.
DEFINITIONS AND ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES.
ART. 145.-The most useful part of Algebra, is that which
relates to the solution of problems. This is performed by means
of equations.
An equation is an Algebraic expression, stating the equality
between two quantities.
-Thus, x-3=4, is an equation, stating, that if 3 be subtracted
from xi the remainder will be equal to 4.
ART. 1416.-Every question is composed of two parts, separated
from each other 5y the sign of equality. The quantity on the left
of the sign of equality, is called the Jirst nzember, or side of the
equation. The quantity on the right, is called the second member,
or side. The members or quantities are each composed of one or
more terms.
ART. I 4L7.-There are generally two classes of quantities in an
equation, the known and the It7unkniown. The known quantities are
represented either by numbers, or the first letters of the alphabet,
as a, b, c, &amp;c.; and the unknown quantities by the last letters of
the alphabet, as x, y, z, &amp;c.
ART. 14S.-Equations are divided into degrees, called Jirst,
seconzd, third, and so on. The degree of an equation, depends on
the highest power of the unknown quantity which it contains.
An equation which contains no power of the unknown quantity
higher than the first, is called an equation of the first degree.
Thus, 2x+5=9, and ax+b=c, are equations of the first degree.
Equations of the first degree are usually called Simple Equations.
An-equation in which the highest power of the.unknown quantity is of the second degree, that is, a square, is called anz equation
of the, second degree, or a qzuadratic equation.
RE -IE w.-145. What is. an equation? Give an example. 146. Of how
Inany parts is every equation composed? How are they separated? What

usually called? What is an equation of the second degree? Give an example. What are equations:of the'second degree usually called.SIMPLE EQUATIONS.                     111
Thus, 4x2-7=29, and ax2+bx=c, are equations of the second
degree.
In a similar manner, we have equations of the third degree,
fourth degree, &amp;c.; the degree of the equation being always the
same as the highest power of bhe unknown quantity which it
contains.
When any equation contains more than one unknown quantity,
its degree is equal to the greatest sum of the exponents of the
unknown quantities in any of its terms.
Thus, xy+ax+by=c, is an equation of the second degree.
x2y+x2 +CX =a, is an equation of the third degree.
ART. 149.-An identical equation, is one in which the two melmbers are identical; or, one in which one of the members is the
result of the operations indicated in the other.
Thus, 2x-1=2x-1, 5x+3x-=8x, and (x+2)(x-2)=x--4,
are identical equations.
Equations are also distinguished as nunmerical and literal. A
numerical equation is one in which all the known quantities are
expressed by numbers.
Thus, x2+2x=3x+7, is a numerical equation.
A literal equation is one in which the known quantities are rep.
resented by letters, or by letters and numbers.
Thus, ax-b=cx+d, and ax2+bx-2x-5, are literal equations.
ART. 15O.-Every equation is to be regarded as the statement,
in algebraic language, of a particular question.
Thus, x-3=4, may be regarded as the statement of the following question: To find a number, from which, if 3 be subtracted,
the remainder will be equal to 4.
If we add 3 to each member, we shall have x-3+3=4+3, or
x-7.
An equation is said to be verified, when the value of the unknown
quantity being substituted for it, the two members are rendered
equal to each other.
Thus, in the equation x-3=4, if 7, the value of x, be substituted instead of it, we have 7-3=4, or, 4=4.
To solve an equation, is to find the value of the unknown quantity;
or, to find a number, which being substituted for the unknown
quantity, will render the two members identical.

ART. 151.-The value of the unknown quantity in any equation, is called the root of that equation.
SIMPLE EQUATIONS, CONTAINING BUT ONE UNKNOWN
QUANTITY.
ART. 152.-The operations that we employ, to find the value
of the unknown quantity in any equation, are founded on this
evident principle: If we perufo rm exactly the same operation on two
equal quantities, the results will be equal. This principle, or axiom,
may be otherwise stated, as follows:
1. If, to two eqzual quantities, the same quantity be added, the sutms
will be equal.
2. If, from two equal quantities, the same qzluantity be subtracted,
the remainders will be eqzual.
3. If two equtal quantities be muntltiplied by the same quantity, the
products will be equal.
4. If two equal quazntities be divided by the same quantity, the
quotients will be equal.
5. If two equal quantities be raised to the same power, the results
will be eqtual.
6. If the same r?oot of two equal quantities be extracted, the r'esults
will be equal.
R E nr A R K.-An axiom is a self-evident truth. The preceding axioms
are the foundation of a large portion of the reasoning in mathematics.
ART. 153.-There are two operations of frequent use in the
solution of equations. These are, first, to clear ait equation' of frac.
tio ns; and, second, to transpose the terms, in order to find the value
of the unknotwn quantity.  These are named in the order in which
they are generally used, in the solution of an equation; we shall,
however, first consider the subject of
TR A N S POSI Ti ON.
Suppose we have the equation 2x-3=--+5.
Since, by the preceding principle, the equality will not be
affected, by adding the same quantity to both members; or, by
subtracting the same quantity from both members; if we add 3
to each member, we have 2x-3+3-=x5+3.
If we subtract x from each member, we have
2x-x--3+3=x--x+5+3.

But, -3 +3 cancel each other; so, also,' do x-x; omitting
these, we have           2x-x-5+3.
Now, the result is the same as if we had removed the terms -3
and +x, to the opposite members of the equation, and, at the same
ti-me, changed their signs.
Again, take the equation ax+b=-c-dx.
If we subtract b from- each side, and add dx to each side, we
have                     ax+dx--c-b.
But, this result is also the same as if we had removed the terms
+b and -dx to the opposite members of the equation, and, at the
same time, changed their signs. Ilence,
Any qzlanztity may be transposed fr'om one side of an equation to
the other, if; at the same time, its sign be changed..
TO CLEAR AN EQUATION OF FRACTIONS.
ART. 1 54.--1. Let it be required to clear the following equation of fractions.
xx
Since the first term is divided by 2, if we multiply it by 2, the
divisor will be renloved; but if we multiply the first term by 2,
we must multiply all the other terms by 2, in order to preserve the
equality of the members. Multiplying both sides by 2, we have
2x
x+_-=10.
Again, since the second term is divided by 3, if we multiply it
by 3, the divisor will be removed; but, if we multiply the second
term by 3, we must multiply all the terms by 3, in order to preserve the equality of the members. Multiplying both sides by 3,
we have                   3x+2x=30.
Instead of multiplying first by 2, and then by 3, it is plain that
we,might have multiplied at once, by 2X3, that is, by the product
of the denominators.
2. Again, let it be required to clear the following equation of
fractions.
x   x
ab  bc
Since the first. term is divided by ab, if we multiply it by ab, the
divisor will be removed; but, if we multiply the first term by ab,
we must multiply all the other terms by ab, in order to preserve
the equality of the members.

Again, since the second term is divided by bc, if we multipy  it
by bc, the divisor will be removed; but, if we multiply the second
term by bc, we must multiply all the other terms by bc, in order to
preserve the equality of the members. Hence, if we multiply all
the terms on both sides, by abXbc, the equation will be cleared of
fractions.
Instead, however, of multiplying every term by abXbc, it is evident, that if each term be multiplied by such a quantity as. will
contain the denominators without a remainder, that all the. denominators will be removed. This quantity is, evidently, the least common multiple of the denominators, which, in this case, is abc;
then, multiplying both sides of the equation by aec, we-have
cx+ax-abcd. Hence, the

Let this value of x be substituted instead of x, in the original
equation, and, if it is the true value, it will render the two members equal to each other.
Original equation,...  3x-3=x+5.
Substituting 4 in the place of x,'it becomes
3X4-3=4+5, or 9-9.
The operation of substituting the value of the unknown quantity instead of itself, in the original equation, to see if it will render the two members equal to each other, is called verification.'rhe preceding equation may be solved thus:
3x-3=x+-5.          By adding 3 to each member, we have
3x-3+3=x+5+3.        By subtracting x fromieach member,
we have 3x-x-3+3=x-x+5+3.
But -3+3 cancel each other; so, also, do x and -x; omitting
these, and then reducing, we have 2x=8.
Dividing each member by 2, x--=  4.
Ra a a c.-The pupil will perceive that the two methods of solution are
the same in principle. In the first, we use transposition, to remove the
known quantity from the left member to the right, and the unknown quantity from the right member to the left. In the second, the same thing is
done, by adding equals to each member, and subtracting equals from each
member-this being the principle on which transposition is founded. It is
recommended to the teacher, to use the latter method until the principle is
well understood by the pupil, after which the first method may be used
exclusively.
6. Find the value of x in the equation x----=4++ 5
Multiplying both sides by 15, the least common multiple of the
denominators, we have 15x-(5x-10)=60+3x+6.
or, 15x- 5x+1O =60+3x+6.
by transposition, 15x-- 5x-3x =60+6 -10.
reducing,  7x-=56.
dividing,   x=8.
7. Find the value of x in the equation b--d  +c.
multiplying both sides by ab, ax -abcl-=bx +abc.

QUESTIONS PRODUCING SIMPLE EQUATIONS, CONTAINING
ONLY ONE UNKNOWN QUANTITY.
ART. 156.-The solution of a problem, by Algebra, consists of
two distinct parts.
1st. To express the conditions of theproblemn in Algebraic langucage; that is, to form the equationz.
2d. To solve the equzation; that is, to find the vallue of the tunknzown
quantity.
With pupils, the most difficult part of the operation of solving
a question, is to form the equation, by the solution of which the
value of the unknown quantity is. to be found. Sometimes, the
statement of the question furnishes the equation directly; and,
sometimes, it is necessary, from the conditions given, to deduce
others, from which to form the equation. When the conditions
furnish the equation directly, they are called explicit conditions.
When the conditions are deduced from those given in the question,
they are called implied conditions.
It is impossible to give a precise rule, by means of which every
question may be readily stated in the form of an equation. The
first point, is, to understand fully the nature of the question, so as
to be able to prove whether any proposed answer is correct.
RE VIE v.--156. Of what two parts does the solutibn of a problem by
Algebra, consist? What are explicit conditions?  What are implied
conditions?
119RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
After this, the equation, by the solution of which the value of
the unknown quantity is to be found, may generally be formed by
the following
RULE.
Denote the required qzlantity, by one of the fial letteirs of the
alphabet; then, by means of signls, indicate the same operationls thlat

R E Mr A R K S.-- 1st. In solving a question, it is necessary to understancl
the principles of the science which it involves, at least so far as they relato
to the question under consideration. Thus, when a problem embraces the
consideration of Ratio or Proportion, in order to solve it, the pupil must bo
familiar with these subjects. In the following examples, the learner is supposed to be acquainted with Ratio and Proportion, as far as they are taught
in Arithmetic. (See Ratio and Proportion, Ray's Arithmetic, Part III.)
2d. The operations concerned in the solution of an equation, involve tho
removal of coefficients, the removal of denominators, and the transposition
of quantities. The first six of the following examples, and also those from
the 16th to the 44th inclusive, are arrangedl with reference to these operations.
EXAMPLES.
1.' There are two numbers, the second of which is three times
the first, and their sum is 48; what are the numbers?
Let x=-- the first number.
Then, by the first condition, 3x- the second.
And, by the second condition, x+3x=48.
Reducing, 4x-48.
Dividing by 4, x-12, the smaller number.
Then, 3x-36, the larger number.
Proof, or verification.  12+36=48.
2. A father said to his son, " The difference of our ages is 48
years, and I am 5 times as old as you."' What were their ages?
Let x- the son's age.
Then 5x= the father's age.
And 5x--x-48.
Reducing, 4x=48.
Dividing, x=-12, the son's age.
Then 5x--60, the father's age.
Verification.  60-12=48, the difference of their ages.
3. What number is that, to which, if its third part be added,
the sum will be 16?
Let x= the required number.
R E VI E W.-156. By what general rule, may the equation of a problem
be found?
120SIMPLE EQUATIONS.
Then the third part of it will be represented by 3.
And, by the conditions of the question, we have the equation
x+3=-16..Multiplying it by 3, to clear it of fractions, 3x+x-48.
Reducing, 4x=48.
Dividing, x--12.
Verflication. 12+ 2--12+4=16; which shows that the value
found is correct, since it satisfies the conditions of the question.
NoTE. -The pupil should ver-ify the answer in every example.
4. What number is that, which being increased by its half, and
then diminished by its two thirds, the remainder will be equal
to 105.
Let x-- the number.
Then the one half will be represented by 2, and the two thirds
2x
by 3x 2x
And, by the question x+2----105.
Multiplying by 6, 6x+3x-4x=630.
Reducing, 5x=630.
Dividing, x--126. Ans.
When the numbers contained in a solution are large, it is sometimes better to indicate the multiplication, than to perform it.
The preceding solution may be given thus:
x 2x
x+-- ---  105
6x+3x-4x=105X6
5x-105X6
x- 21X6z-126.
5. It is required to divide a line 25 inches long, into two parts,
so that the greater shall be 3 inches longer than the less.
Let x= the length of the smaller part.
Then x+3= the greater part.
And by the question, x+x+3=-25.
Reducing, 2x+3=25.
Transposing 3, 2x=25-3-=22.
Dividing, x=l 1, the smaller part.
And x+3-14, the greater part.
6. It is required to divide 68 dollars between A, B, and 0, so that
B shall have 5 dollars more than A, and C 7 dollars more than B.
111'22  ~'  RAY'S ALGEBRA,     PART FIRST.
Let x- A's share.
Then x-5=-- B's share.
And x+12= C's share. Then, by the terms of the question,
we have x+ (x+5)+(x+12)-68.
Reducing, 3x-17=68.
Transposing, 3x=68- 17=51o
Dividing, x-17, A's share.
x+5 =22, B's share.
x-+12--29, C's share.
7. What number is that, which being added to its third part,
the sum will be equal to its half added to 10.
Let x represent the number.
Then, the number, with its third part, is represented by x+-;
3
and its half, added to 10, is expressed by +10. By the condiXX
tions of the question, these are equal; that is, x--- + 10.
Multiplying by 6,    6x+2x-3xz-'- 60.
Reducing and transposing, 8x--3x--60.
5x--60.
Dividing, x=12.
Vergfication. 12+ 2--2 + 10. Or 16=16, according to the
conditions.
H-ereafter, we shall, in general, omit the terms, transposing,
dividing, &amp;c., as the various steps of the solution will be evident
by inspection..
8. A cistern was found to be one third full of water, and after
emlptying into it 17 barrels more, it was found to be half full;
what number of barrels will it contain when full?
Let x= the number of barrels the cistern will contain.
x      x
Then    17--
2x+102=3x
102=--x
Or, by first transposing 3x and 102, we have --x--102;
multiplying both sides by -1, we have x=102.
The unknown quantity, when its value is found, is generally
made to stand on the left side of the sign of equality; it is not
material, however, which side it occupies, since, by transposition,
it can be readiry removed to the other. In effecting the transposition of 102-=x, so as to bring the x on the left side, we have
made it to consist of two steps; it is, however, generally made in
one; the transposition, and multiplying by -1, being both made
in one line at the same time.SIMPLE EQUATIONS.                     123

both members of the equation.
9. A cistern is supplied with water, by two pipes; the less alone
can fill it in 40 minutes, and the greater in 30 minutes; in what
time will they fill it, both running at once'?
Let x- the number of min., in which both together can fill it.
Then   = the part which both can fill in 1 minute.
x
Since the less can fill it in 40 minutes, it fills 4 of it in 1 minute...Since the greater can fill it in 30 minutes, it fills -3o of it in
1 minute. Hence, the, part of the cistern which both can fill in
1 minute, is represented by 43   and also, by -.'               x
Hence, _1   1
Multiply both sides by 120x, and we have 3x+4x=120.

Therefore, 5x+9( 100-x)=600

x=75, the number of pounds at 5 cents.
100-x=25,     "    "    "     "( 9 cents.
12. A laborer was engaged for 30 days. For each day that he
worked, he received 25 cents and his boarding; and, for each day
that he was idle, he paid 20 cents for his boarding. At the expiration of the time, he received 3 dollars; how many days did he
work, and how many days was he idle?
Let x= the number of days he worked.
Then 30-x- the number of days he was idle.
Also 25x- wages due for work.
And 20(30-x)= the amount to be deducted for boarding.
Therefore, 25x-20(30-x)-300
25x-600+20x =300

30-x=10= the number of days he was.idle.
Proof: 25X20=500.cents, = wages.
20X10=200 cents, = boarding.
300 cents, = the remainder.
In solving this example, we reduce the 3 dollars to cents, in
order that the quantities on both sides of the eq.uation may be of
the same denomination. For, as we can only add or subtract numbers of the same denomination, it is evident, that we can only
compare quantities of the same name. IIence, all the quantities,
in both members of an equatio2n, mutst be of the same denzomination.
13. A hare is 50 leaps before a greyhound, and takes 4 leaps
to the greyhound's 3; but 2 of the greyhound's leaps are equal to
3 of the hare's; how many leaps must the greyhound take, to
catch the hare?
Let x be the number of leaps taken by the hound. Then, since
the hare takes 4 leaps while the hound takes 3, the number of
leaps taken by the hare, after the starting of the hound, will be
4X_
3; and the whole number of leaps taken by the hare, will be
43,

14. The hour and minute hands of a watch are exactly together
between 8 and 9 o'clock; required the time.
Let the number of minutes more than 40, be denoted by x; that
is, let x= the minutes from VIII to the point of coincidence, P;
then, the hour hand moves from VIII to the point P, while the
minute hand moves from XII to the same point; or, the former
moves over x minutes, while the latter moves over 40+x. minutes;
but the minute hand moves 12 times as fast as the hour hand.
Therefore, 12x=40+-x

SIMPLE EQUATIONS CONTAINING TWO UNKNOWN QUANTITIES.
ART. 157.-In order to find the value of any unknown quantity,
it is evident, that we must obtain a single equation containing it,
and known terms. Hence, when we have two or more equations,
containing two or more unknown quantities, we must obtain from
them a single equation containing only one unklnown quantity.
The method of doing this, is termed elimination, which may be
briefly defined thus: Elimination is the process of deducing from
two or more equations, containing two or more unknown quantities,
a less number of equations containing one less unknown quantity.
There are three methods of elimination.
1st. Elimination by substitution.
2d. Elimination by comparison.
3d. Elimination by addition and subtraction.
ELIMINATION BY SUBSTITUTION.
ART. 158.--Elimination by substitution, consists in finding the
value of one of the unknown quantities in one of the equations, in
terms of the other unknown quantity and known terms, and substituting this, instead of the quantity, in the other equation.
To explain this, suppose we have the following equations, in
which it is required to find the value of x and y.
NoTE.- The figures in the parentheses, are intended to number the
equations for reference.
x+2=--17   (1.)
2x+3y-28 (2.)
By transposing 2y in the equation (1), we have x-17--2y. Substittting this value of x, instead of x in equation (2), we have
2(17-2y)+3y=28
or, 34-4y+3y-    28
or, -y=28-34
y=6
and   x-17-2y=17-12=5.
Hence, when we have two equations, containing two unknown
quantities, we have the following
RULE,
FOR ELIMINATION BY SUBSTITUTION.

ELIMINATION BY       COMPARISON.
AiRT. 159.--Elimination by comparison, consists in finding the
value of the same unknown quantity in two different equations,
and. then placing these values equal to each other.
To illustrate this method, we will take the same equations whiW

ELIMlINATION BY ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION.
ART. 1.60.-Elimiination by additio'n and subtraction, consists
in miultiplying or dividing two equations, so as to -render the co~ifficient of one of the unknown quantities, the same in both; and
then, by adding, or subtracting,. to cause the termT conitaining it to
disappear.
To- explain this miethod, we will take the sa me equiations used
to illustrate elimination by substitution and comparisoni.
x+2y~= 1 7  (1.)
2x+3 =z28    (2.)
134SIMPLE EQUATIONS.                       135
If we multiply equation (1) by 2, so as to make the coefficient
of x the same as in the second equation, we have
2x+4y--34     (3.)
2x+3y-=28, equation (2) brought down.
y=6
Since the coSfficient of x has the same sign in these equations,
if we subtract, the terms containing x will cancel each other, and
the resulting equation will contain only y, the value of which may
then readily be found. After this, by substituting the value of y,
as before, the value of x is easily obtained.
To illustrate the method of eliminating, when the co-fficients of
the unknown quantity to be eliminated, have contrary signs in the
two equations, suppose we have the following, in which it is
required to eliminate y.
3x-5y=6. (1.)
4x+3y-=37   (2.)
It is obvious, that if we multiply equation (1) by 3 and (2) by
5, that the co-fficients of y will be the same. Thus,
9x--15y- 1S
20x+ 15y=185
adding, 29x         203
x   -    7.
Substituting this value of x in equation (2), we have
28+3y-=37
3y= 9
y= 3
From this we see, that after making the coefficients of the quantity to be eliminated, the same in both equations, if the signs are
alike, we must subtract; but if they are tunlike, we must add them.
Hence, when we have two equations, containing two unknown
quantities, we have the following
RULE,
FOR ELIMINATION BY ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION.
Multiply, or divide the equations, if necessary, so that one of the
u,nknown quantities will have the same coefficient in both. Then take
the difference, or the stum of the eqzlations, according as the signs of
the eqzual terms are alike or unlike, and the resulting equation will
contain only one unknown quantity.

the coifficients ara'not prime, find their least common multiple, and multiply

QUESTIONS PRODUCING EQUATIONS CONTAINING TW'O
UNKNOWN QUANTITIES.
ART. 161.-The questions contained in Art. 156, were all capable of being solved by using one unknown quantity; although,
several of the examples contained two, and in some cases more,
unknown quantities. In those questions, however, there was such
a connection existing between the several quantities, that it was
easy to express each one in terms of the other. But it frequently
happens, that in a problem containing two unknown quantities,
there may be no direct relation existing between them, by means
of which either of them may be found in terms. of the other. In
such a case, it becomes necessary to use a separate symbol for
each unknown quantity, and then to find the equations containing
these symbols, on the same principle as where there was but one
unknown quantity; that is, in brief, regard the symbols as the answer to the question, and then proceed in the same manner as it would
be necessary to do, to prove the answer. After the equations are
obtained, the values of the unknown quantities may be found, by
either of the three different modes of elimination.
We shall first give two -examples, which can be solved by using
either one or two unknown quantities.
136SIMPLE EQUATIONS.
In general, no more symbols should be used. than are really
necessary; unless, by using them, the solution is rendered more
simple.
1. Given, the sum of two numbers equal to 25, and their difference equal to 9, to find the numbers.
Solution, by using one unknown quantity.
Let x= the less number; then x+9- the greater.
And x+x-9--=25.
2x-=16
x-8, the less number; and x+9-17, the greater.
Solution, by using two unknown quantities.
Let x= the greater, and y-= the less.
Then x-y--25 (1.)
And x -y= 9 (2.)
2x=34, by adding the two equations together.
x=-17, the greater number.
2y=16, by subtracting equation (2) from equation (1).
y=  8, the less number.
2. The sum of two numlbers is 44, and they are to each othur
as 5 to 6; required the numbers.
Solution, by using one unknown quantity.
Let 5x=- the less number; then 6x= the greater.
And 5x+6x--44.
1 x-44
x--4
5x--20, the less number.
6x-24, the greater number.
Solution, by using two unknown quantities.
Let x= the less number, and y= the greater.
Then x-+y=44 (1.)
And x: y: 5: 6
or, 6x--5y  (2.) by multiplying means and extremes.
6x+6y-264    (3.) by multiplying equation (1) by 6.
6y--264-5y, by subtracting equation (2) frol (3).

If x represents the price of a pound of coffee, what will represent the price of a pound of tea? What will represent the cost
of both the tea and coffee?
15. A grocer sold 1 pound of tea, 2 pounds of coffee, and 3
pounds of sugar, for 65 cents; the price of a pound of coffee was
twice that of a pound of sugar, and the price of a pound of tea
was three times that of a pound of coffee. Required the cost of
~each of the articles.
If x represents the price of a pound of sugar, what will represent the price of a pound of coffee? Of a pound of tea? What
will represent the cost of the whole?

1. James bought 2 apples and 3 peaches, for 16 cents; the price
of a peach was twice that of an apple; what was the cost of each?
If x represents the cost of an apple, what will represent the
cost of a peach? What will represent the cost of 2 apples? Of
3 peaches? Of both apples and peaches?

7. Daniel bought twice as many apples as peaches for 24 cents;
each apple cost 2 cents,.and each peach 4 cents; how many of
each did he buy?138          RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST,
number 6 be subtracted, the remainder is a number whose digits are
those of the former in an inverted order; required the number?
In solving questions of this kind, the pupil must be reminded,
that any number consisting of two places of figures, is equal to 10
times the figure in the ten's place, plus the figure in the unit's
place. Thus, 23 is equal to 10X2+3. In a similar manner, 325
is equal to 100X3+10X24-5.
Let x= the digit in the place of tens, and y=- that in the place
of units.  
Then 10x+y_ the number.
And 10y+x= the number, with the digits inverted.
Then x+y--6 (1.)
And 2(10x+y)-6-l10y+x (2.)
or, 20x-+2y--6=10y+x.

4. What two ltumbers are those, to which if 5 be added, the
sums will be to each other as 5 to 6; but, if 5 be subtracted from
each, the remainlders will be to each otlier as 3 to 4?
By the conditions of the question, we lhave the following proportions:              x:5 y+-5: 5: 6
x-5: --5:: 3:4.
Since, in every proportion, the product of the means is equal to
the product of the extremes, we have the two equations
6(x+5)=5(y+5)
4(x-5)=3(y-5)
Fi    these equations, the va.lues of x and y are readily found to
b6e20aland 25.
RE AR RI.-Instead of saying, that the two sums will be to each other
as 5 to 6, it will be the same to say, that the quotient of the second divided'by the first, is equal to, since six divided by 5, expresses the ratio of 5 to 6.
This would give the following equations:
y+5_6aind iL-5=4
x+5 5     x-5 3
which may be readily obtained from those given above.

QUANTITIES.
ART. 162.-Equations involving three or more unknown quan--
tities may be solved, by either of the three methods of elimination
explained in the preceding.Article, as we shall now proceed to
show, by solving an example by each of these methods.
Suppose we have the three following- equations, in which it is
required to find the valtes of x, y, and z.,.,+2y+  z=20o (1.)
~2x +"y+3z=31    (2.)
3x+4y+2z=44     (3.)
Solutiohn by substitution..
From equation (1), x=20-2y-z.
Sub'stituting this in equation (2), we have
2(20-2y-z)+y+3z-31.
or, 40-4y-2z-  y+3z--31.
3y-z-9    (4.)
Substituting the same value of x in equation (3), we have
3(20-'2y-z) +4y+2z=44.
or, 607-6y-3z-4y+2z=44.
2y+z=1l6   (5.)
3y--z=9- -(4.)
IHere the values of y and: zaire:readily found by the rule, Art.

we find x=4.,  
Solution by comparison.

Comparing the first and seconid values of x, we have

or, 40-4y-2z=    -y-3z
or, 3y-z- 9  (4.):
Comparing the first and third values of x,- we have.

Solution by addition and subtraction.
Multiplying equation (1) by 2, to render the co-fficient of x the
same as in equation (2), we have
2x+4y+2z=40
equation (2) is.2x+ y+3z-3 1
by subtracting,   3y-Z-z- 9    (4.)
Next; multiplying equation (1) by 3, to render the coefficient of
x the same as ih equation (3), we have
3x+6y+3z-=60
equation (3) is 3x+4y-+2z=44
by subtracting,. 2y-+ z=16   (5.)
3y-- z=   9  (4.)
by adding,     5y   _   25
y  =-   5
Then 10+z--16, and z=6.
And    x+10+6--20, and x=4.
R E M A R K.-The methods of elimination by substitution and comparison, when there are more than two unknown quantities, are merely an
extension of the rules already presented, in Articles 1SS and 159; therefore, it is unnecessary to repeat them here. When the number or unknown
quantities is three or more, and particularly when each of the unknown
quantities is found in all the equations, the method of elimination by addition and subtraction is generally preferred; we shall, therefore, illustrate it
"by another example.
Let it be required to find the value of each of the unknown
quantities in the following equations.
v+2x+3y+4z-=30       (1.)
2v+3x+ y+ z=r15       (2.)
3v+ x+2y+3z-23        (3.)
4v+2x--t14z=61        (4.)
Let us first eliminate v: this may be done by making the coefficient of v, in one of the-equations, the same as in the other three,
and then subtracting.
2v+4x+6y+Sz-=60, by multiplying equation (1) by 2.
2v+3x+y+z=15          (2.)
x+5y+7z-_45       (5.), by subtracting.
3v+6x+9y+12z=90,       by multiplying equation (1) by 3.
3v+x+2y+3z-23         (3.):5x--7y+9z-67     (6.), by subtracting.
4v+8x+12y+16z=120, by multiplying equation (1) by 4.
4v+2x--y+14z=      61   (4.)
6x+- 13y+2z:= 59   (7.), by subtracting.
144SIMPLE EQUATIONS.                     145
Collecting into one place, the new equations (5), (6), and (7),
-we find, that the number of unknown quantities, as well as the
number of equations, is one less:
x+5y+7z-=45    (5.)
5x+7y+9z=67      (6.)
6x+ 13y+2z-=59   (7.)
The next step is to eliminate x, by making the coefficient of x,
in one of the equations, the same as in each of the others, and
then subtracting.
5x+25y+35z=2'25, by multiplying equation (5) by 5.
5x+7y+9z- 67
18y+26z=158    (8.)
6x+30y+42z-=270, by multiplying equation (5) by 6.
6x+13y+2z'= 59
17y--40z=21 1 (9.)
Bringing together equations (8) and (9), we find, that the number of equations, as well as of unknown quantities, is now two
less.               18y+26z-158      (8.)
17y+40z=-211 (9.)
306y+442z=2686, by multiplying equation (8) by 17.
306y-720z-=3798, by multiplying equation (9) by 18.
278z= 1112
z--   4
Substituting the value of z, in equation (9), we get
17y+160_211
17y- 51
y= 3.
Substituting the values of y and z, in equation (5), we get
x+15+28=-45
x-2
And lastly, substituting the values of x, y, and z, in equation
(1), we get            v+4+9+16=30
or, v=-l.
From the preceding example, we derive the
GENERAL RULE,
FOR ELIM1NATION BY ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION.
1st. Combine any one of the equations with each of the others,.so
as to eliminate the same utnknown qu'antity; there will thus arise a
new class of equations, containing one less unknown quantity.
2- d. Combine any one-of these new equations iith7i eachof the others,
so as to eliminate another unknown quantity; there will thus arise
another ahss of equations, containing two ies unknown quantities.
S13146         RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
3d. Continue this series of operations until a single equtation is
obtaiined, containing buet one unknowin quantity, from which its valte
may be easily found; then, by going back, and substituting this value
i, the derived equations, the values of the other unknown quantities
may. be readily found.
R E A R KR.-When the number of unknown quantities in each equation,
is less than the whole number of unknown quantities involved, the method
of substitution will generally be found the shortest. By solving several of
the following examples, by each of the three different methods, the pupil
will be able to appreciate their relative excellence in different cases.

QUESTIONS PRODUCING EQUATIONS CONTAINING         THREE OR
iMORE UNKNOWN QUANTITIES.
ART. 163.-When a question contains three or more unknown
quantities, equations involving them, can be found on the same
principle as in questions containing one or two unknown quantities. (See Articles 156 and 161.)  The values of the unknown
quantities may then be found by either of the three methods of
elimination.
R E 31 A R K.-The method of elimination to be preferred, will depend on
the manner in which the unknown quantities are combined, and must be
left to the judgment of the pupil. When such a relation exists between the
different unknown quantities, that one or more of them can be expressed
directly in terms of another, it should be done, as this generally renders the
solution more simple.
1. A person has 3 ingots, composed of 3 different metals in different proportions-; a pound of the first contains 7 ounces of silver, 3 of copper, and 6 of tin; a pound of the second consists of
12 ounces of silver, 3 of copper, and 1 of tin; and a pound of
the third, of 4. ounces of silver, 7 of copper, and 5 of tin. How
much of each of the ingots must be taken, to form another ingot
of 1 pound weight, consisting of 8 ounces of silver, 34 of copper,
and 4- of tin?
Let x, y, z, be the number of ounces to be taken of the 3 ingots
irespectivelyv.
Then, since 16 ounces of the first contain 7 ounces of silver,
1 ounce will contain 1- of an ounce of silver; and hence, x ounces
7x
will contain -6 ounces of silver.
12y
In the same manner, y ounces of the second will contain -
16
4z
ounces of silver; and z ounces of the third will contain`6 ounces
of silver. But, by the question, the number of ounces of silver
in a pound of the new ingot, is to be 8, hence

Or, by clearing it of fractions,

1. James bought a lemon and an orange; the orange cost twice
as much as the lemon, and the difference of their prices was 2
cents; what was the'cost of each?
If x represent the cost of the lemon, what will represent the
cost of the orange? What is 2x less x represented by?
2. What is 3x less x represented by? What is 3x less 2x represented by?
What is 4x less x represented by? What is 5x less 2x represented by?
The word minus, is used instead of less; and the sign -, for
the sake of brevity, is used to avoid writing the word minus.
Thus, if we wish to take the difference between 3x and x, we
may say,
3x less x,
or 3x minus x; which may be written 3x-x.
When the sign - is used, it is to be read minus.

Reasoning in a similar manner with reference to the copper and
the tin, we have the two following equations:
3x+3y+7z--60 (2.)
6x+ y+5z=68. (3.)
The co'ifficient of y being the simplest, will be most easily eliminated.
If we multiply the second equation by 4, and take the first equation from the product, the result is
5x+24z=112    (4.)
If we multiply the third equation by 3, and take the second
from the product, the result is
15x+8z=144 (5.)
If we multiply the last equation by 3, and take the preceding
equation from it, the result is
40x=320
x--8
Substituting this value of x in equation (5), we have
120+8-z144
z-3
And substituting these values of x and -z, in equation (3),
48+y+15=68
-y=5
Hence, the new ingot will contain 8 ounces of the first, 5 of the
second, and 3 of the third.

SUPPLEMENT TO EQUATIONS OF TIHE FIRST DEGREE.
GCENERAIZ AT ION.
ART. 164.-EQUATIONS are termed literal, when the known
quantities are represented, either entirely or partly, by letters.
Quantities represented by letters, are termed general values--hecause, by giving particular values to the letters, the solution of one:!problem, furnishes a general solution to all others of the same kind.
The answer to a problem, when the known quantities are represented by letters, is termed a formrula, and a formula, expressed
ihn ordinary language, furnishes a rule.
By the application of Algebra to the solution of general questions, a great number of useful and interesting truths and -rules
may be established. We shall now proceed, to illustrate:tvs subject, by. a few examples.:-.. - --..-.::::i

2. Again, let it be required to find another number, which being
divided by 4, and by 7, the sum of the quotients will be 11.
By proceeding, as in the preceding question, we find the nurmber to be 28.
Instead, however, of solving every example of the same kind
separately, we may give a general solution, that will embrace all
the particular questions. Thus:

equal to another given number, c.
X X,
Let x= the number; then X--=e.

The answer to this question is termed a formula; it shows,.that
the required number is equal to the continued product of a, b, and
c, divided by the sum of a and b. Or, it may be expressed in
ordintry language, thus: Multiply together the three given numbers,
and divide the product by the sum of the divisors; the result will be
the r equired number.
The pupil may test the accuracy of this rule, by solving the
following examples, and verifying the results.

Then -1= the-part of the work which both can do in one day.
Also, if A can do the work in m days, he can do - part of it in

ART. 16S.--Let it be required to find a rule for dividing the gainr  -
or loss in a partnership, or, as it is generally termed, fellowship.
First, take-a particular question.,:     -
1. A, B, and C, engage in trade, and put in stock in the follow-.
ing proportions: A put in 3 dollars, as often as B put in.4, and as  -
often as C put in 5 dollars. Their gains amounted to 60 dollars;.  
required the share of each, the gains being divided in proportion
to the stock put in....
Let 3x=; A's share of the gain, then 4x= B's, and 5x=:Cs.
(See Example 24, page 126.)
Then 3x+4x+5x=60'
or, 12x=60
x= 5
3x=15, A's share.
-4x=20, B's "
5x=-25, C's   "                           - --:.
2. To make this question general, suppose A puts in m dollars,;  
as often as B puts in n dollars, and as often as C puts in r dollars;
and that they gain c dollars. To find the share of each.  
vR EVYIE. -166. By what rule do you find two quantities, when:their:h
sum and difference are given? 167. When the times arf given,i in' Iwhich
each of two agents can -produce a certain effect, how is th:e-timne:found it..
which they can jointly produce it?154          RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
Let the share of A be denoted by mx, then nx= B's, and rx--
C's share. Then mx+nx+rx=c-e

mx--m         n     +
m+n+r m+n[U+r
~        nc
m+n+r m+n+r
By examining these formula, we see that the whole gain, c, is
divided by m+n+r, the sum of the proportions of stock furnished
by all the partners, and that this quotient is multiplied by z,.n,
and r, each one's respective proportion, to obtain his share of the
gain.
If c had represented loss, instead of gain, the same solution
would have applied. Hence, to find each partner's share of the
gain or loss, we have the following
RULE.
Divide the whole gain or loss by the sum of the proportions of
stock, anzd multiply the quotient by each partner's proportion, to
obtainl his respective share.
When the times in which the respective stocks are employed
are different, it becomes necessary to reduce them to the same
time, to ascertain what proportion they bear to each other.
Thus, if A have 3 dollars in trade 4 months, and B 2 dollars 5
months, we see, that 3 dollars for 4 months, are the same as 12
dollars for 1 month; and 2 dollars for 5 months, are the same as
10 dollars for one month. Therefore, in this case, the gain or loss
must be divided in the proportion of 12 to 10; that is, in proportion to the product of the stocks by the times in which they were
employed. Hence, when time in fellowship is considered, we have
the following
RULE.
dtltiply each man's stock by the time during which it was employed; and then, according to the preceding rule, divide the gain
or loss in proportion to these products.
3. A, -B, and C engaged in trade;- A put in 200 dollars, B 300,
and C 700; they lost 60 dollars;. what was each man's share?
Ans. A's loss $10, B's $15, and C's $35.

times in which the stock is employed are the same? How is it found) when.
the times are different?.  GENERALIZATION.                     155
Since the sums engaged, evidently are to each other, as 2, 3,
and 7, we may either use these numbers, or those representing the
stock.
4. In a trading expedition A put in 200 dollars 3 months, B
150 dollars for 5 months, and C 100 dollars for 8 months; they
gained 215 dollars; what was each man's share of the gain?
/*-              Ans. A's share $60, B's $75, and C's $80.
PART. 169.-1. Two men, A and B, can perform a certain piece
of work in a days, A and C in b days, and B and C in c days; in
what time could each one, alone, perform it? and, in what time

Let x, y, and z represent the days in which A, B, and C can

Then -, -, and -, represent the parts -of the work which A, B,

ART. 170.-:In the solution of questions, it is sometimes;necessary to use general values for particular quantities, to ascertain
the relation which they bear to each other; as in the following
problem.
If 4 acres pasture 40 sheep 4 weeks, and 8 acres pasture 56
sheep 10 weeks, how many sheep will 20 acres pasture.0:weeks,
the grass growing uniformly all the time?
The chief difficulty in solving this question, consists in ascertaining the relation that exists between the original quantity of
grass on an acre, and the growth on each acre in one week.Let m= the quantity on an acre when the pasturage began, and
n-- the growth on 1 acre in 1 week; m and n representing pounds,
or any other measure of the quantity of grass.
Then 4n= the growth on 1 acre in 4 weeks.
And 16n= the growth on 4 acres in 4 weeks.:
Also, 4m+16n= the whole amount of grass on 4 acres in 4
weeks.
If 40 sheep eat 4m+ 16n in 4 weeks, then 40 sheep eat
4m+1 6n
4 -m-4n in one week.
And 1 sheep eats        40    0 in one week.  
Again, 8m+80n= the whole amohnt of grass on 8 acres in 10
weeks.
If 56 sheep eat 8m+80n in 10 weeks,

NEGATIVE SOLUTIONS.
ART. 17"2.-It has been stated already (Art. 23), that when a
quantity has no sign prefixed, the pign pluts is understood; and
also (Art. 64), that all numbers or quantities are regarded as positive, unless, they are otherwise designated. Hence, in all problems, it is understood, that the results are required in positive
numbers.'It sometimes happens, however, that the value of' the
unknown quantity in the solution of a problem, is found to be

examine a question of this kind.

I EGATIVE SOLUTIT1ONS.RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
Now, -2 added to 5, according to the rule for Algebraic Addition, gives a sum equal to 3; thus, 5+(-2)-3.  The result, -2,
is said to satisfy the question in an algebraic sense; but the problem is evidently impossible in an axrithmetical sense, since any positive number. added to 5, must increase, instead of diminishing it;
and this impossibility is shown, by the result being negative, instead of positive. Since adding -2, is the same as subtracting
+2 (Art. 61), the result is the answer to the following question:
What number must be suzbtracted from 5, that the remainder may
be equal to 3?
Let the question now be made general, thus:
What number must be added to the number a, that the sum
shall be equal to b?'Let x- the number.
Then a+x=b.
And x-b-a.
Now, since a+(b-a)=b, this value of x will always satisfy the
question in an algebraic sense.
While b is greater than a, the value of x will be positive, and,
whatever values are given to b and a, the question will be consistent, and can be answered in an arithmetical sense. Thus, if b=10,
and a=8, then x=2.
But if b becomes less than a, the value of x will be negative;
mnd whatever values are given to b and a, the result obtained, will
satisfy the question in its algebraic, but not in its arithmetical sense.
Thus, if b=5, and a=8, then x=--3. Now 8+(-3)-5; that
is, if we subtract 3 from 8, the remainder is 5. We thus see, that
when a becomes greater than b, the question, to be consistent,
should read, What number must be subtracted from the number a,
that the remainder shall be equal to b?' From this we see,
1st. That a negative solution indicates some inconsistency or absurdity, in the question from which the equation was derived.
2d. When a negative solution is obtained, the qutestion, to which it
is the answer, may be so modiJied as to be consistent.
Let the pupil now read, carefully, the "OBSERVATIONS ON ADDI-. TION AND SUBTRAcTION," page 43, and then modify the following
questions, so that they shall be consistent, and the results true in
an arithmetical sense.

DISCUSSION O F PR-O B L E M S.
ART. 173.-When a question has been solved in a general manner, that is, by representing the known quantities by letters, we
may inquire what values'the results will have, when particular
suppositions are made with regard to the known quantities. The
determination of these values, and the examination of the various
results which we obtain, constitute what is termed the discussiona
of the problem.
The various forms which the value of the unknown quantity may ~
assume, are shown in the discussion of the following question.
1. After subtracting b from a, what number, multiplied by the
remainder, will give a product equal to c?
Let x- the number.
Then (a-b)x-c.
C
a-b:
Now, this result may have five different forms, depending on the  
values of a, b, and c.
No TE E.-In the following forms, A denotes merely some quantity.
1st. When b is less than a. This gives positive values, of the
form +~A.
2d. When b is greater than a. This gives negative values, of
the form -A.
3d. When b is equal to a. i This gives values of the-form -.
4th. Where c is 0, and b either greater or less than- a. This
gives values of the form.
5th. When b is equal to a, and c is equal to 0. This gives
values of the form -.  
We shall examine each of these in succession.
I. When b is less than a.:In this case, a-b is: positive, and the value of x is positive.
To illustrate this form, let a=8, b=3, and c-=20, then:x-=4.

question, to which it is the answer, be modified? 173. What do you understand by the discussion of-- problem: The expression c divided by a-b,

14RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
IT. When b is greater than a.
In this case, a-b is a negative quantity, and the value of x
will be negative. This evidently should be so, since minus multiplied by minus produces plus; that is, if a-b is minus, x must
be minus, in order that their product shall be equal to c, a positive quantity. To illustrate this case by numbers, let a=2, b=5,
and c=12; then, a-b---3, x=-4, and -3X-4=-12.
III. When b is equal to a.
In this case x becomes equal to O. We must now inquire, what
is the value of a fraction when the denominator is zero.
c
1st. Suppose the denominator 1, then I-c.
2d. Suppose the denominator -lu, then  -  1O0c..01
4th. Suppose the denominator 1 -uo, then  c  1000c.
While the numerator remains the same, we see, that as the denominat6r decreases, the value of the fraction increases. Hence,
if the denominator be less than any assignable quantity, that is 0,
the value of the fraction will be greater than any assignable quantity, that is, infinitely great. This is designated by the sign wo,
that is                      c
O
This is interpreted by saying, that no finite value of x will
satisfy the equation; that is, there is no number, which being
multiplied by 0, will give a product equal to c.
IV. When c is 0, and b is either greater or less than a.
0
If we put a-b equal to d, then x=--0, since dXO=0; that
is, when the product is zero, one of the factors must be zero.
V. When b=a, and c=0.
c    0
In this case, we have x-----, or xXO=0.
a-b 0o
Since any quantity multiplied by 0, gives a product equ.ld to 0,
any finite value of x whatever, will satisfy- this equation; hence, x
is indeterminate. On this account, we say that - is the symbol
of indetermination; that is, the quantity which it represents, has
no particular value.

162PROBLEM OF THE COURIERS.
The form 8 sometimes arises from a particular supposition, when
the terms of a fraction contain a common factor.  Thus, if
2a 2 b                               2--a2 2
x----- and we make b=a, it reduces to -a    o; but, if we
cancel the common factor, a-b, and then make b=a, we have
x=2a. This. shows, that before deciding the value of the unknown
quantity to be indeterminate, we must see that this apparent indetermination h'ls not arisen from the existence of a factor, which,,
by a particular supposition, becomes equal to zero.
The discussion of the following problem, which was originally
proposed by Clairaut, will serve to illustrate further the preceding
principles, and show, that the results of every correct solution,
correspond to the circumstances of the problem.
PROBLEM       OF THE COURIERS.
Two couriers depart at the same time, from two places, A and
B, distant a miles from each other; the former travels mn miles an
hour, and the latter, n miles; where will they mieet?
There are two cases of this question.
I. When the couriers travel toward each other.
Let. P be the point where they meet, A.         B
and a-AB, the distance between the               P
two places.
Let x-AP, the distance which the first travels.
Then a-x=BP, the distance which the second trav-els.
Then, the distance each travels, divided by the nunimber of miles
traveled in an hour, will give the number of hours he was traveling.
Therefore, x _ the number of hours the first travels.

And      = the number of hours the second travels.

1st. If we suppose m greater than n, the value of x will be positive; that is,~ the couriers will meiet on the right of B.' This-evidently corresponds to the circumstances of the problem.2d. If we suppose n greater than m, the value of x, an'd ails
that of x-a, will be negative. This negative value of x shows
that there is some inconsistency in the question (Art. 172). - Indeed, when m is less than n, it is evident that the couriers can not
meet, since the forward courier is traveliing faster than the hindmost. Let us now inquire how the question may be modified-:so
that the value obtained for x shall be consistent. -'  
If we'suppose the direction changed in which- the couriers
travel; that is, that the first travels  P',B
from A, and the second from B to-                A

will be consistent, if we regard- the couriers, instead of traveling
toward P, as traveling in the opposite direction toward P'. The
change of sign, thus indicating a change of direction (Art. 64).
3d. If we suppose m equal ton.
In this case xs equal to --, andx-a --:  IMPOSSIBLE PROBLEMS.
As has been already shown (Art. 173), when the unknown
quantity takes this form, it is not satisfied by any finite value; or,
it is infinitely great. This evidently corresponds to the circumstances of the problem; for, if the couriers travel at the same
rate, the one can never overtake the other. This is sometimes
otherwise expressed, by saying, they only meet at an infinite distance from the point of starting.
0               0
4th. If we suppose a=-0, then x-, and x-a--  
m-n -            m-n
When the unknown quantity takes this form, it has been shown
already, that its value is 0. This corresponds to the circumstances
of the problem; for, if the couriers are no distance apart, they
will have to travel no (0) distance to be together.
5th. If we suppose m=n, and a=0.
In this ease, x==, and x-a=-. When the unknown quantity
takes this form, it has been shown (Art. 173), that it may have
any.finite value whatever. This, also, evidently corresponds to the
circumstances of the problem; for, if the couriers are no distance
apart, and travel at the same rate, they will be always together;
that is, at any distance whatever from the point of starting.
am
Lastly, if we suppose n=0, then x=--=a; that is, the first
courier travels from A to B, overtaking the second at B.
m           2amt
If we suppose n---, then x    2 -= 2a, and the first travels
twice the distance from A to B, before overtaking the second.
Both results evidently correspond to the circumstances of the
problem.
CASES OF INDETERMINATION IN EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST
DEGREE, AND IMPOSSIBLE PROBLEMS.
ART. 1 74.-An equation is termed iindependent, when the relation
of the quantities which it contains, can not be obtained directly
fiom others with which it is compared. Thus, the equation
x+-2y=1 1
2x+5y=Z26
are independent of each other, since the one can not be obtained
from the other in a direct manner.
R E vi E w.-173. What is the value of x when b--a and c=O? What is

sometimes arises from the existence of a common factor, which, by a particular hypothesis, reduces to zero. Discuss the problem of the " Couriers,"
and show, that in every hypothesis the solution corresponds to the circumi
sta.ncos of the problem.
165RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
The equations, x+2y-11
2x+4y=22, are not independent of each other,
the second being derived directly from the first, by multiplying
both sides by 2.
ART. I 75.-An equation is said to be indeterminate, when it can
be verified by different values of the same unknown quantity.
Thus, in the equation x-y-5, by transposing y, we have x-5+y.
If we make y=l, x=6. If we make y-2, x=7, and so on;
from which it is evident, that an utnlimited number of values may
be given to x and y, that will verify the equation.
If we have two equations containing three unknown quantities,
we may eliminate one of them; this will leave a single equation,
containing two unknown quantities, which, as in the preceding
example, will be indeterminate.
Thus, if we have x+3y+z-10
and x+2y-z=   6, if we eliminate x we have
y+2z- 4, from which y-4-2z.
If we make z --l1, y-2, and x-10--3y-z-=3.
If we make z=1-, y- l, and x-5.
In the same manner, an unlimited number of values of the three
unknown quantities may be found, that will verify both equations.
Other examples might be given, but these are sufficient to show,
that uwhen the number of unknown quantities exceeds the number of
inzdependent equations, the problem is indeterminate.. A question is sometimes indeterminate that involves only one
unknown quantity; the equation deduced from the conditions, being
of that class denominated identical. The following is an example.
What number is that, of which the 4, diminished by the -, is
equal to the -ao increased by the -~'?
Let x- the number.
3x  2x    x  x
T 4 -3 =20+ 30'
Clearing of fractions, 45x-40x-3x+2x
or, 5x=5x, which will be verified by
any value of x whatever.
ART. 1176.-The reverse of the preceding case requires to be
considered; that is, when the number of equations is greater than
the number of unknown quantities. Thus, we may have
x+ y=lO     (1.)
x- y= 4 (2.)
2x-3y=- 5   (3.)
Each of these equations being independent of the other two,
one of them is unnecessary, since the values of x and y, which are
7 and 3, may be determined from any two of them. When't
166IMPOSSIBLE PROBLEMS.
problem contains more conditions than are necessary for determining the values of the unknown quantities, those that are unnecessary, are termed redundant conditions.
The number of equations may exceed the number of unknown
quantities, so that the values of the unknown quantities shall be
incompatible with each other. Thus, if we have
x+ y= 9 (1.)
x+2y-13     (2.)
2x+3y=21 (3.)
The values of x and y, found from equations (1) and (2), are
x=5, y/=4; from equations (1) and (3), are x=6, y=3; and from
equations (2) and (3), are x=3, y=5. From this it is manifest,
that only two of these equations can be true at the same time.
A question that contains only one unknown quantity, is sometimes impossible. The following is an example.
What number is that, of which the - and' diminished by 4, is
equal to the - increased by S?
Let x= the numbei, then  - --4= -   +8.
Clearing of fractions, 3x+2x-24=5x+48.
by subtracting equals from each side, 0=72; which shows, that
the question is absurd.
R E MI A ItR.-Problems from which contradictory equations are deduced,
are termed irr}ational or iMlpossible. The pupil should be able to detect the
character of such questions when they occur, in order that his efforts nlay
not be wasted, in. an attempt to perform an impossibility. A careful study
of the preceding principles, will enable him to do this, so far as equations
of the first degree are concerned.
ART. 177.-Take the equation ax-cx=b-d, in which a repre-sents the sum  of the positive, and -c the sum of the negative
cobfficients of x; b the sum of the positive, and --d the sum ofthe negative known quantities.  This will evidently express a
simple equation involving one unknown quantity, in its most
general form.
This gives (a-c)x=b-d.
Let a-c-m, and b-d=n, we then have mx--n, or x=-.
Now, since n divided by m can give but one quotient, we infer
that an equlation of the first degree 7has but one root; that is, in a
simple equation involving but one unknown quantity, there is but
one value that will verify the equation.

CHAPTER VI.
FORMATION OF POWERSEXTRACTION    OF THE SQUARE ROOT--RADICALS            OF THE
SECOND   DEGREE.
INVOLUTION, OR FORMATION OF POWERS.
ART. 178.-The term power is used to denote the product arising from multiplying a quantity by itself, a certain number of
times; and the quantity which is multiplied by itself, is called the
root of the power.
Thus a" is called the second power of a, because a is taken twice
as a factor; and a is called the second root of a2.
So, also, a3 is called the third power of a, because aXaXa-a3,
the quantity a being taken three times as a factor; and a is called
the third root of a3.
The second power is generally called the square, and the second
root, the square root. In like manner, the third power is called
the cube, and the third root, the cube root.
The figure indicating the power to which the quantity is to be
raised, is called the index, or exponent; it is to be written on the
right, and a little higher than the quantity. (See Articles 33
and 35.)
R E A A R K.--A power may be otherwise defined thus: The nthpowoer ofJ
a guantity, is the product of n factors, each equal to the quanatity; where  
may be any number, as 2, 3, 4, and so on. Therefore, wve may obtain a,y
powuer of a. qualtity by taking it as affactor as many tinme as theire arce -ncits
in the exponent of t]hepotewr to which it is to be craised. This rule alone, is
sufficient for every question in the formation of powers; but, for the moro
easy comprehension of pupils, it is generally presented in- detail, as in the
following cases..
C-ASE 1.
TO RAISE A MONOMIAL TO ANY GIVEN POWER.
ART. 179.-i-. Let it be required to raise 2abm- to the third
power.
-  According to the definition, the third power of 2ab2, will be the
product arising from taking it three times as a factor. Thus,
(2ab_)3=2ab X2ab X.2ab=--2X2X2aaab b b2
-   23Xa21+1+Xb'+2+223Xalx3Xb 2X38a3b6
In this example, we see, that the coefficient of the power is foundFORMiATION    OF POWERS.                  169
by raising the co'fficient, 2, of the root, to the given power; and,
that the exponent of each letter is obtained, by multiplying the
exponent of the letter in the root, by 3, the index of the required
power.
ART. 1SO.-With regard to the signs of the different powers,
there are two cases.
First, when the root is positive; and second, when the root is
negative.
1st. When the root is positive. Since the product of any nurnmher of positive factors is always positive, it is evident, that if the
root is positive, all the powers will be positive.
Thus, +aX+a-+a2
+-aX+aX+a-+a3, and so on.
2d. When the root is negative. Let us examine the different
powers of a negative quantity, as -a.
-a= first power, negative.
-aX-a=+a2- second power, positive.
-aX-aX-a--a3-- third power, negative.
-aX-aX-aX-a-+a4= fourth power, positive.
-aX--aX-aX-aX-a-          -a--     fifth power, negative.
From this, we see, that the product of an even number of negative factors is positive, and that the product of an odd number of
negative factors is negative. Therefore, the even powers of a negative quantity are all positive, and the odd powers are all negative.
Hence we have the following
RUL.E,
FOR RAISING A MONOMIAL TO ANY GIVEN POWER.
Raise the numeral cofflicient to the required power, and multiply
the exponent of each of the letters, by the exponent of the power. If
the monomial is positive, all the powers will be positive; but, if it is
negati'e, all the even powers will be positive, and all the oddpowers
negative.

BINO MI AL THEOREM.
ART. 1S3.-The    Binomial Theorem (discovered by Sir Isaac
Newton), explains the method of raising the sum  or difference of
any two quantities to any given power, by means of certain relations, that are always found to exist between the exponent of the
power and the different parts of the required Aesult.
To discover what these relations are, we shall first, by means of
multiplication, find the different powers of a linomial, when both
terms are positive; and next, when one term is positive, and the
other negative.

172FORMATION OF POWERS.
ART. 1S4.-In examining the different parts of which these
results consist, there are evidentlyfour things to be considered.
1st. The number of terms of the power.
2d. The signs'of the terms.
3d. The exponentts of the letters.
4th. The coifficients of the terms.
We shall examine these separately.
1st. Of the nunmber of terms.
By examining either of these examples, we see, that the second
power has three terms, the third power has four terms, the fourth
power has five terms, the fifth power haLs six terms; hence, we
infer, that the number of terms in any power of a binomial, is one
greater than the exponent of the power.
2d. Of the signs of the terms.
From an examination of the examples, it is evident, that when
both terms of the binomial are positive, all the terms will be positive.
When thefijrst term is positive, and the second negative, all the ODD
terms will be POSITIVE, and the EVEN terms NEGATIVE.
N 0 TE.-By the odd terms are meant the 1st, 3d, 5th, and so on; and,
by the even terms, the 2d, 4th, 6th, and so on.
3d. Of the exponents of the letters.
If we omit the co-fficients, the remaining parts of the fifth
powers of a+b and a-b, are
(a+b)5.........           a5+a 4b+a3b2+a2b3 +ab4+b.
(ab).......    a5-a4b+a1-a32_   b3_+ab-b5.
An examination of these and the other different powers of a+b
and a-b, shows, that the e;Kponents of the letters are governed by
the following laws:
1 st. The exponent of the leading letter in the first term, is the same
as that of the power of the binomial; and the exponents of this letter
in? the-other terms, decrease by unity from left to right, until the last
term, which does not contain the leading letter.
2d. The exponent of the second letter in the second term is oze;
and the other exponents of this letter increase, by tulity, from left to
right, tuntil the last term, in which the exponent is the same as that
of the power of the binomial.
3d.'The sum of the exponents of the two letters in any term is
always the same, and is equal to the pouwer of the binomial.

The pupil may now employ these principles, in writing the different powers of binomials without the coefficients, as in the following examples.

An inspection of the different powers of (a+b) and (a-b),
plainly shows,
That the coifficient of the first term'/is always 1; and the cofflicient of the second term is the same as that of the power of the bizomial.
The law of the succeeding coifficients is not so readily seen; it
is, however, as follows:
If the cofficient of any term  be multiplied by the exponent of the
leading letter, and the product be divided by the niumber of that teerm
from the left, the quotient will be the coeficient of the inext term.
Omitting the coefficients, the terms of a+b raised to the sixth
power, are    a6+a5b+a4b-2+a3b3+a2b4+ab5+b6..The coefficients, according to the above principles, are
1 6  6X5    15X4    20X3     15X2   6X1
22     3       4'    5      6
or, 1, 6, 15,    20,      15,     6,      1.
Hence, (a+b)6-a6+6a5b+ 15a4b2+20a3b3+ 15a2b4+6ab5+b6.
From this, we see, that the coefficients- of the following terms
are equal: the first and the last; the second from the first, and the
second from the last; the third from the first and the third from
the last, and so on. Hence, it is only necessary to find the co,fficients of half the terms, when their number is even, or one more
than half, when their number is odd; the remaining coefficients
being-equal to those already found.

EXTRA CTION OF THE SQUARE ROO'.
EXTRACTION OF THE SQUARE ROOT OF NUMBERS.
ART. 1S7.-THE second root, or square root of a number, is that
number, which being multiplied by itself, will produce the given
number. Thus, 2 is the square root of 4, because 2X2-4.
The process of finding the second root of a given number, is
called the extraction of the square root.
ART. 1SS.-The first ten numbers are
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
and their squares are
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.
The numbers -in the first line, are also the square roots of the
numbers in the second.
We see, from this, that the square root of a number between 1
and 4, is a number between 1 and 2; the square root of a number between 4 and 9, is a number between 2 and 3; the square
root of a nulmber between 9 and 16, is a number between 3 and
4, and so on.
Since the square root of 1 is 1, and of any number less than
100, is either one figure, or one figure and a fraction, therefore,
when the number of places of figures in a number is not more than
TWO, the number of places of figures in the sqzuare root lwill be ONE.
Again, take the numbers
10, 20, 30,    40,   50,   60,   70     80,   90,   100,
their squares are
100, 400, 900, 1600, 2500, 3600, 4900, 6400, 8100, 10000.
From this we see, that the square root of 100 is ten; and of
any number greater than 100, and less than 10000, the square
root will be less than 100; that is, when the n1umber of places of
figulres is more than TWO, anld not more than roUR, the nugmber of
places of figures in the square root will be TWO.
In the same manner, it may be shown, that when the number
of places of figures in a given number are more than four, and
not more- than six, the numnber of places in the square root will be
three, and so on. Or thus: when the number of places of figures
17t6EXTRACTION OF THE SQUARE ROOT.
in the number is either one or two, there will be one figure in the
root; when the number of places is either three or four, there will
be two figures in the root; when the number of places is either
five or six, there will be three figures in the root, and so on.
ART. 1S9.-Every number may be regarded as being composed
of tens and units.  Thus, 23 consists of 2 tens and 3 units; 256
consists of 25 tens and 6 units. Therefore, if we represent the
tens by t, and the units by u, any number will be represented by
t+u, and its square, by the square of t+u, or (t+U)2.
(t+u) 2=t2+2tUt+u2=_t2+ (2t+u)u.
Hence, the square of any number is comnposed of the square of the
tens, pluts a quzantity, consisting of twice the tens pltus the units, multiplied by the units.
Thus, the square of 23, which is equal to 2 tens and 3 units, is
2 tens squared _(20)2-400
(2 tens + 3 units) multiplied by 3=(40+3)X3=129
*                                 ~-                    5529
1. Let it now be required to extract the square root of 529.
Since the number consists of three places             52'3123
of figures, its root will consist of two places,       400
according to the principles in Art. 188; we  20X2=40 129
therefore separate it into two periods, as in         3
the margin.                                           43129
Since the square of 2 tens is 400, and of 3 tens, 900, it is evident, that the greatest square contained in 500, is the square of
2 tens (20); the square of two tens (20) is 400; subtracting this
from 529, the remainder is 129.
Now, according to the preceding theorem, this number 129 consists of twice the tens plus the units, multiplied by the units; that
is, by the formula, it is (2t+u)u.  Now, the prodiuct of the tens
by the units can not give a product less than tens; therefore, the
unit's figure (9) forms no part of the double product of the tens
by the units. Then, if we divide the remaining figures (12) by
the double of the tens, the quotient will be the unit's figure, or a
figure greater than it.

16RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
We then double the tens, which makes 4 (2t), and dividing this
into 12, get 3 (u) for a quotient; this is the unit's figure of the
root. This unit's figure (3) is to be added to the double of the
tens (40), and the sum multiplied by the unit's figure. The double
of the tens plus the units, is 40+3=43 (2t+-u); multiplying this
by 3 (ut), the product is 129, which is the double of the tens plus
the units, multiplied by the units. As there is nothing left after
subtracting this from the first remainder, we conclude
that 23 is the exact square root of 529.                  529j23
In squaring the tens, and also in doubling them, it  4
is customary to omit the ciphers, though they are un- 431129
derstood. Also,the unit's figure is added to the double  129
of the tens, by merely writing it in the unit's place.
The actual operation is usually performed as in the margin.
2. Let it be required to extract the square root of 55225.
Since this number consists of five places of figures, its root will

In performing this operation, we find the square

in the preceding example. We next consider the 431152
23 as so many tens, and proceed to find the unit's  129
figure (5) in the same manner as in the preceding 46512325

the pupil must be acquainted with the relation that exists between
the squares of two consecutive numbers.
Let a and a+ 1 be two consecutive numbers.
Then (a+1)2=a2+2a+1, is the square of the greater.
(a)2--a2       is the square of the less.
Their difference is 2a+1.
Hence, the difference of the squares of two consecutive 7numbers, is
equal to twice the less number, increased by unity. Consequently,
when the remainder is less than twice the part of the root already
found, plus unity, the last figure can not be increased.

EXTRACTION OF THE SQUARE ROOT OF FRACTIONS.
ART. 191.-Since g-X.=9, therefore, the square root of 4 is 2,
that is, 94 _/   2. Hence, when both terms of a fraction are
perfect squares, its sqzlare root will befound, by extracting the squlare
root of both termns.
Before extracting the square root of a fraction, it should be
reduced to its lowest terms, unless both numerator and denominator are perfect squares. The reason for this, will be seen by the
following example.

ART. 192.-A number whose square root can be exactly ascertained, is termed a pe7fect square. Thus, 4, 9, 16, &amp;c., are perfect squares. Comparatively, these numbers are few.
A number whose square root can not be exactly ascertained, is
termed an impe2fect square. Thus, 2, 3, 5, 6, &amp;c., are imperfect
squares.
Since the difference of two consecutive square numbers, a2 and
a2+2a+1, is 2a+1; therefore, there are always 2a imperfect
squares between them. Thus, between the square of 4(16), and
the square of 5(25), there are 8(2a=2X4) imperfect squares.
A root which can not be exactly expressed, is called a surd, or
irrational root. Thus 1/2 is an irrational root; it is 1.414+.
The sign +, is sometimes placed after an approximate root, to
denote that it is less, and the sign -, that it is greater than the
true root.
It might be supposed, that when the square root of a whole
number can not be expressed by a whole number, that it might be
found exactly equal to some fraction. We will, therefore, show,
that the square root of an impeifect square, can not be afraction.
Let c be an imperfect square, such as 2, and if possible,. let its
square root be equal to a fraction -b which is supposed to be in its
lowest terms.
I,-,       2
Then -c=-; and c-b2 by squaring both sides.
Now, by supposition, a and b have no common factor, therefore,
their squares, a2 and b2, can have no common factor, since to square
a number, we merely repeat its factors.  Consequently, b-i must
be in its lowest terms, and can not be equal to a whole numiber.
Therefore, the equation c=--, is not true; and hence, the supposition is false upon which it is founded; that is, that V/c--; therefore, the squtare root of an impe?fect square can not be afraction.

EXTRACTION OF THE SaQUARE ROOT OF MONOMIALS.
ART 195.-From the principles in Art. 179, it is evident, that,
in order to square a monomial, we must square its cobfficient, and
multiply the exponent of each letter by 2.  Thus,
(3ab2) =3ab'x3ab2=9a2b4.
Therefore, V/9ab4--3ab2.  Hence, the
RULE,
FOR EXTRACTING THE SQUARE ROOT OF A MONOMIAL.
Extract the square root of the co'fficient, and divide the exponent
of each letter by 2.
Since +aX+a=+a2, and -aX-a--+a2,
Therefore V/a2=+a, or -a.
Hence, the square root of any. positive quantity is either plus,
or minus. This is generally expressed, by writing the double sign
before the square root. Thus, /4a2=--2a,'which is read, plus:or
minus 2a.
If -a monomial is negative, the extraction of the square root is
impossible, since the square of any quantity, either positive or
negative, is necessarily positive. Thus, l/-9, /-47a2, V-b, arealgebraic symbols, which indicate impossible. operations.  Such.
expressions are termed imaginary quantities. They occur, in attempting to find the value of the unknown quantity in an equation

EXTRACTION OF THE SQUARE ROOT OF POLYNOMIALS.,
ART. 196.-In order to deduce a rule, for extracting the square
root of a polynomial, let us first examine the relation that exists
between the several terms of any quantity and its square.
(a+b)2=a2+2ab+b2-a2+ (2a+b)b.
(a+b+c)2 =a2+2ab+b2+2ac+2bc+c2 a2+ (2a+b) b+(2a+2b
+c)c.
(a+b+c+d)2-a2+2ab+b2+2ac+2bc+c2+2ad+2bd+2cd+d2
=-a+ (2a+b)b+(2a+2b+c)c+(2a+2b+2c+d)d.
Or, by calling the successive terms of a polynomial r, r', r", r"',
we shall have (r7+r'+r"'+r"')2-r2+ (2r+-/)r'-+ (2r -2'1+~//#)', +(2r+-2r'+2r +2/'- ) r"/'.
In this formula, r, r', r",?'#, may represent any algebraic quantities whatever, either whole or fractional, positive or negative.
Hence, we see, that the square of any polynomial is formed
according to the following law:
The square of any polynomial is equal to the square of the first
term-plus twice the first term, plus the second, multiplied by the second-plus twice the first and second terms, plus the third, multiplied
by the third-plzus twice the first, second, and third terms, plus the
fburth, multiplied by the fourth, and so on. Hence, by reversing
the operation, we have the

FOR EXTRACTING THE SQUARE ROOT OF A POLYNOMIAL.

root, and subtract the produtct from  the last remaiinder.  Theni piroceed in a similar manner, tojitd the other terms.
R  M N  n RK.-In the course of the operations on any example, when we
find a remainder, of which the first term is not exactly divisible by double
the fiist term of the root, we may conclude that the polynomial is not a perfect square.

The square root of the first term is r, which we write as the first
term  of the root.   We next subtract the square of r from the
given polynomial, and dividing the first term   of the remainder
2rr', by 2r, the double of the first term of the root, the quotient is
r, the second term of the root. We next place r' in the root, and
also in the divisor, and multiply the divisor thus increased, by r',
and subtract the product from    the first remainder.   We then
double the terms r+r', of the root already found, for a partial divisor, and find that the quotient of 2rr", the first term of the remainder, divided by 2r, the first term  of the divisor, is r', the third
term of the root. Completing the divisor, multiplying by re', and
subtracting, we find there is nothing left.
N o T E.-The first remainder consists of all the terms after r2, and the
second, of all after r'2. It is useless to bring down more terms than have
corresponding terms in the quantity to be subtracted.

RADICALS OF THE SECOND DEGREE.
ART. 119S.-FRO,W the rule Art. 195, it is evident, that when a
monomial is a pelfect square, its nulmeral coFfficient is a pelfect
square, and the exponent of each letter is exactly divisible by 2.'IThus, 4a' is a perfect square, while 5a' is not a perfect square,
because the coefficient, 5, is not a perfect square, and the expoiient,. 3, is not exactly divisible by 2.
When the exact division of the exponent can not be performed,
it may be indicated, by writing the divisor under it, in the form
3
of a fraction.- Thus, V/a3 may be written a:.
Since a is the same as a' the square root of a may be expressed
thus, a'. For this reason, the fractional exponent, i, is used to
indicate the extraction of the square root. Thus, r/a'+2-ax+x2
and (a2+2ax+x'2), also V/4and 4, indicate the same operation;
the radical sign, 1/, and the fractional exponent, b-, being regarded
as equivalent..  Quantities of which the square root can not be exactly ascert'lined, are termed radicals of the second degree. They are also
called, irrational quanztities, or surds. Such are the quantities l/a,
1/2, aV/b, and 51/3-  Or, as they may be otherwise written, a2,
I   1          1'2, abe', and 5(3)2. The quantity which stands before the radical sign, is called the co.fficient of the radical.  Thus, in the
expressions al/b, and 3V/5, the quantities a and 3 are called
coefficients.
Two radicals are said to be similar, when the quantities under
the radical sign are the same in both. Thus, 31/2 and 71/2 are
sirnilar radicals; so, also, are b1va and 2cV/a.
Two radicals that are not similar, may frequently become so,
by simplification. This gives rise to

REDUCTION OF RADICALS OF THE SECOND DEGREE.
/ART.199.-Reduction of radicals of the, second degrcee con.
sists in ch'angring the formi of the quantities without altering their
value. It is founded on the following principle.
The square r-oot of the product of two or more factors, is equtal to
the product of thte square r-oots of those factors.
That is, }/1ab=j/aXi/b; which is thus proved:
(Vlab )2 =ab
and (VlaX1/bV'=paXVlbXya'lcT         lXI/ IaXV/bXVbab.
Hence, Vlab and i/aX-V'b are, equal to each other, since the
square of each is equal to ab.
From this principle, we have V36=V/4X9:=2X3, I/ f4-4
V9X 16-3X4.
Any radical of the second degree, can be reduced to a simpler
form, when it can be separated into factors, one of which is a perfect square.
Thus, Vj12=j14X3=V4&gt;1\v3-2V3

A fractional radical of the second degree may be reduced to its
simplest form, by the same rule, by first multiplying both terms
by any quantity that will render the denominator a perfect square;
separating the fraction into two factors, one of which is a perfect
F,quare, then extracting the square root of the square factor, and
p,lacing it before the other factor placed under the radical sign.

denominator rational, the calculation merely consists in finding the square
root of 2, and then dividing by 2. The work by the latter method, requires
only about half the labor of that by the former. Besides, the operator feels
certain, if he has made no mistake, that the last figure of his result is correct. Whereas, by the other mode, as the divisor is too small, the quotient
figures soon become too large. Thus in this example, if we use seven decimals for a divisor, the seventh figure of the quotient is too large; if we
only use six places of decimals, the sixth figure will be erroneous.

EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE.
ART. 206.-An Equation of the Second Degree (See Art. 148),
is one in which the greatest exponent of the unknown quantity
is 2. Thus, x2-9, and 5x2+3x=26, are equations of the second
degree.
An equation containing two or more unknown quantities, in
whioh the greatest exponent, or the greatest sum of the exponents
of the unknown quantities, is 2, is also an equation of the second
degree. Thus, xy--6, x2+xy-8,- xy+x+y=I 1,. are equations of
the second degree.
Equations of the Second Degree, are frequently denominated
Qutadratic Equations.
ART. 207.-Equations of the second degree are of two kindsincomplete and complete.
An incomplete equation of the. second degree, is of the form
ax2_:b, and contains only the second power of the unknown quantity, and known terms. Thus, x2=9, and 8x2-5x2=12, are incomplete equations of the second degree.
An incomplete equation of the second degree, is frequently
denominated a pure quadratic equation.
A complete equation of the second degree, is of the form
ax-2+bx=c; and contains both the first and second powers of the
unknown quantity, and known terms. Thus, 3x2+4x=20, and
ax2-bx2+ dx-ex=f-g, are complete equations of the second
degree.
A complete equation of the second degree, is frequently denominated an affected qzuadratic equation.

ART. 208.-Every equation of the second degree, may be reduced to one of the forms ax2=b, or ax2+bx=c.  For, in an
incomplete equation, all the terms containing x2 may be collected
together, and then, if the co0fficient of x2 contains more than one
term, it may be assumed equal to a single quantity, as a, and the
sum of the known quantities, to another quantity, b, and then the
equation becomes   ax2-=b, or ax2-b--O.
So a complete equation may be similarly reduced; for all the
terms containing x2, may be reduced to one term, as ax2; and
those containing x, to one, as bx; and the known terms to one, as
c; then the equation is ax2+bx-c, or ax2+bx--c=O.
Hence, we infer: That every equation of the seconzd degree, may
be reduced to an incomplete equation involving two terms, or to a complete equation involving three terms.
Frequent illustrations of these principles will occur hereafter.

Reduce the eqtuation to the form ax2=b. Divide both sides by the
coeoficient of x2, and then extract the square root of both members.

By transposing,        x2-_m2=--0
By separating into factors,  (x+m)(x-m)=0.
Now, this equation can be satisfied in two ways, and in two
only; that is, by making either of the factors equal to 0.
By making the second factor equal to 0, we have
x-m-=O, or x=+m.
By making the first factor equal to 0, we have
x+-m=0, or x=-m.
Since the equation (x+m)(x-m)=0O, can be satisfied only in
these two ways, it follows, that the values of x obtained from these
conditions, are the only values of the unknown quantity.

COMPLETE EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE.
1. Let it be required to find the values of x, in the equation
x2-4x+4=--1.
It is evident, from Article 197, that the first member of this
equation is a perfect square. By extracting the square root of
both members, we have x-2=-11
Whence                     x=2~-1=2+1=3, or 2-1=1.
VerfiJcation. (3)2-4X3+4=1, that is, 9-12+4-1
also,         (1)2-4X1+4=1, that is, 1- 4+4-1.
Hence, x has two values, +3 and +1, either of which verifies
the equation.
2. Let it be required to find the value of x, in the equation
x2+6x-=16.
If the left member of this equation were a perfect square, we
might find the value of x, by extracting the square root, as in the
preceding example. To ascertain what is necessary to be added,
to render the first member a perfect square, let us compare it with
the square of x+a, which is x2+2ax+a2.
We find                  x2-x2
2ax =--6x
2a =6
a =3
a2--.
Hence, by adding 9, which is the square of half the cofflcient of
the first power of x, to each member, the equation becomes
x2+6x+9=25
Extracting the square root,  x+3=t-5
Whence                x=-3t--5=+2, or -8.
Either-of which values of x will verify the equation.
ART. 212.-We will now show the different forms to which
every complete equation of the second degree may be reduced, and
illustrate further, the principle of completing the square.
Since every complete equation of the second degree may be reduced to the form ax2+bx=c, if we divide both sides by a, we have
b   c
x2+-x=-.
a   a
b         c
For the sake of simplicity, let -=-p, and -=q.  The equation
a         a
then becomes            x2+2px=q       (1.)
b.
If b is negative, and a positive, the equation becomes
a -             a
x2-2px=q      (2.)
202EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE.
If - is positive, and c negative, the equation becomes
a               a
x2+2px=--q    (3.)
Lastly, b  cand  
Lastly, if - and - are both negative, the equation becomes
a     a
x2-2px=--q    (4.)
IIence, every complete equation of the second degree, may be reduced to the form x2+2px=q, in which 2p and q may be either positive or negative, integral or fractional quantities.
We will now proceed to explain the principle, by which the
first member of this equation may always be made a perfect
square.
Since the square of a binomial is equal to the square of the first
term, plus twice the product of the first term by the second, plus
the square of the second; if we consider x2+2px as the first two
terms of the square of IL binomial, x2 is the square of the first term
(x), and 2px, the double product of the first term by the second;
therefore, if we divide 2px by 2x (the double of the first term), or
2p by 2, the quotient, p (half the coefficient of x), will be the second term of the binomial, and its square, p2, added to the first
member, will render it a perfect square. But, to preserve the
equality, we must add the same quantity to both sides. This gives
X2+2px+p2-=q+p2
Extracting the square root,  x+p --i1/q+p2
Transposing,                 x=--_T:l/q-+p2
It is obvious, that the square may be completed in each of the
other forms, on the same principle; that is, by taking half the
coSfficient of the first power of x, squaring it, and adding it to
each member. Thus, in the second form
x2-2px-q
Xe_2pX+p2=q+p2  2
x-p--4-1/q+p2
--+p:4:q +p
In the third and fourth forms, the values of x are readily obtained, in the same manner.
Collecting the four different forms together, and the values of z
in each, we have the following table.
(1.) x2 +2px=q.                  x= -pi= /q+p2.
(2.) =2-2px=q.                   x=+p-~-/q+-p2.
(3.) x2+2px=--q.               xq=-_p~_/q+p2.
(4.) x2--2   ---q.             x=-z+r~i/ q-p2.

Although the method of finding the value of x is the same in
each of these forms, it is convenient to distinguish'between them.
See Art. 215.
From the preceding we derive the
RULE,
FOR THE SOLUTION OF A COMPLETE EQUATION OF THE SECOND
DEGREE.
1st. Reduce the equation, by clearing of fractions and transposition (if necessary), to the form ax2+bx=c.

ART. 21 3.-THE  HINDOO METHOD OF SOLVING QUADRATICS.When an equation is brought to the form ax2+bx,c, it may be
reduced to a simple equation, without dividing by the coefficient
of x2; thus avoiding fractions.
If we multiply both sides of the equation ax2+bx=c, by a, the
cofficient of x", it becomes a2x2+abx=ac.
Now, if we regard a2x2+abx, as the first and second terms of
the square of a binomial, a2x2 must be the square of the first term,
and abx the double product of the first term by the second. Hence;:.
the first term of the binomial is /ax---ax; and the second term,

PROBLEMS PRODUCING COMPLETE EQUATIONS OF THE
SECOND DExGREE.
ART. 214.-1. What number is that, whose square, diminished
by the number itself, is equal to 20?
Let x-= the number.
Then                      x2 x--20
Completing the square, x2 -x+--20+ -  -
Extracting the root,    x-2=l:Z
Whence                       x=+5, or -4.
Now either of these values of x satisfies the equation; but the
negative value -4, does not fulfill the conditions of the question
in an arithmetical sense. But, since the subtraction of a negative
quantity is equal to the addition of a positive quantity, the question may be so modified, that the value -4, will be a correct
answer to it, the 4 being considered positive. The question thus
changed, is: What number is that, whose square increased by the
number itself, is equal to 20?
2. A person buys-several oranges for 60 cents; had he bought
3 more for the same sum, each orange would have cost him 1 cent
less; how many did he buy?
Let' x= the number he bought.
TJhen -= the pirice of each one.
x
60
And    0- the price of one, had he bought 3 more for 60 cents.
x+3
60   60
Therefore,               60
x   x+3
Clearing of fractions, and reducing,
x2+3x-=180
Completing the square,  x2+3x+ 9=-9+180=729
Extracting the root,              3x+-27
Whence                            x=-+12, or -15.
Now either of these values, taken with its proper sign, satisfies
the equation from which it was derived; but the value 12 is the
only one that satisfies the conditions of the question.
Since      45                   and since buying and selling
are opposite operations, the result, -15, is the answer to this
question. A person sells several oranges for 60 cents. Had he
sold 3 less for the same sum, he would have received one cent more
for each. How many oranges did he sell?
RE AR K.-From the two preceding examples, we see, that the root
which is obtained, from giving the. plus sign to the radical, satisfies both
18
209210:RAY'S ALGEBRA, P:ART FIRST.
the conditions of the question, and the equation derived from it; while the
other root. satisfies:the equation only.   -.:
We see, also,.that the root which arises from giving the radical the negative sign, may be. regarded as the answer to a question -differing, from the
one proposed in this; that certain quantities which were additive, have
become subtractive, and reciprocally.
Sometimes, however, as in the following example, both. values of the
unknown quantity satisfy the conditions of the question.
3. Find a number, whose square increased by 15, shall be 8
times the number.
Let x= the number; then x2+- 15-r8x
Or                          x2-8x-- 15
Whence                            x--5, or 3.
Either of which fulfills the conditions of the question.
When there are two unknown qiuantities. in a problem, that can
be solved by the use of one symbol, the two values of the symbol
generally give both values of the unknown quantity, as in the
fbllowing question.
4. Divide the number 24 into two such parts, that their product
shall be 95.
Let x= one of the parts; then 24-x= the other.
And                     x(24-x)=95
Or                       x2--24x--95
Whence                         x-=19 and 5
And                        24-x-5, or 19.
5. There are three; numbers, such that the product of the first
and third is equal to the square of the second; the. sum of the
first and second is 10, and the third exceeds the second, by 24;
required the numbers.
Let x= the first; then 10-x= the second,
And 10-x+24=34--x-= the third.
Also                  (10-x)2=x(34-x)
Or               100-20x+x2-=34x-x  
From which,                  x=-25, or 2.
When x=25, 10-x=-15, 34-x-=9, and the numbers are 25,
-15, and 9.
When x=-2, 10-x=8, 34-x=32, and the numbers are 2, 8,
and 32.
Both these sets of values satisfy the question in an algebraic
sense; only the last, however, satisfies it in an arithmetical sense.
Let us endeavor to ascertain how the question must be modified,
so that the first set of numbers shall satisfy it in an arithmetical
sense.EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE.
The meaning of the negative solution -15, will be understood
by considering that the addition of a negative quantity, is the same
as the subtraction of the same quantity taken positively (Art 61).
The first condition of the question then becomes 25+(-15)=-25
-(+15)-25-15=10; and the second is 9-(--15)_9+(+15)
-=9+15-24. This indicates, that -15 may be changed to +15,
provided, that instead of the condition of the sum of the first and
second numbers being 10, their difference be 10; and the second
condition may for a similar reason, be changed into this, that the
sum of the second and third is 24. The question, with these modifications, would be: What three numbers are those, such that the
product of the first and third, is equal to the square of the second;
the difference of the first and second is 10; and the sum of the
second and third is 24?
R E rf A R K.-In the following examples, the pupil is required to find
only that value of the unknown quantity, which satisfies the conditions of
the question in an arithmetical sense. It forms, however, a good exercise
for advanced pupils, to determine the negative value, and then to modify
the question, so that this value shall satisfy the conditions in an arithmetical
sense.

PROPERTIES OF THE ROOTS OF A COMPLETE EQUATION
OF THE SECOND DEGREE.
NOTE TO T E A CHERS.-This subject may be omitted entirely, by
the younger class of pupils; and passed over, by those more advanced,
until the book is reviewed.
ART. 215.-The pupil may have learned already, by inference,
from the solution of the preceding examples, that an equation of
the second degree has two roots, that is, that the unknown quantity has two values. This- principle may be proved directly, as
follows.
The general form to which every complete equation of the second degree may be reduced, is x2+2px--q; in which 2p and q
may be either both positive or both negative, or one positive and
the other negative. Completing the square, we have
x2 2pX+p2pqA-p2
Now, the first member is equal to (x+p)2, and if, for the sake of
simplicity, we assume q+p-2=-n2, that is, r/q+p2=m, then
(X+p)2=m2
Transposing,          (x+p)2-m2--O.
But, since the left hand member of this equation, is the difference of two squares, it may be resolved into two factors, Art. 94.
This gives          (x+p+m)(x+p-m)=O
Now, this equation can be satisfied in two ways, and in only two;
that is, by, making either of the factors equal to 0.
If we make the second factor equal to zero, we have
x+p-m=O
Or, by transposing,  x=---p+mz--    +/q+P2
If we make the first factor equal to zero, we have
x+p+qm=-O
Or, by transposing,   x=-p-m=-p-          q2+2.
Hence, we conclude,
1st. That every equation of the second degree, has two roots, and
only.two.
2d. That e?very complete equation of the second degree, redutced to
the form x2+-2px=q, may be decomposed into two binomial factors,
o!f which the first term in each is x, and the second, the two roots with
their signs changed.
Thus, the two roots of the equation x2-5x=-6, or x2--5x+6
-0, are x=2 and x=3; hence, x2 -5x+6=(x-2) (x-3).
From this, it is evident, that the direct method of resolving a
q(uadratic trinomial into its factors, is to place it equal to zero, and
then find the roots of the equation. In this manner, let the

If. we examine the part 1/q+p2, we see that its value must be
a quantity greater than p, since the square root of p2 alone, is p.
Hence, the first root is the difference between p and a positive
quantity greater than p; therefore, it is essentially positive.
If we take the negative value of the radical part, the second
root is equal to the sum of two negative quantities, one of which
is p, and the other a quantity greater than p; therefore, it is
essentially negative. Since the first root is the difference, and the
second root the sum, of the same two quantities, the second, or
negative root, is necessarily greater than the first, or positive root.
See questions 7, 8, 9, 10, page 205.
In the equation x2-2px=q, or second form,
the two values of x are  +p-+V-/q+p2
And                         +p-   /q+p2
The quantity under the radical being the same as in the preceding form, its square root is greater than p. The first root then,
is the sum of two positive quantities, one of which is p, and the
other a quantity greater than p; therefore, it is essentiallypositive.
If we take the negative value of the radical part, the second
root is equal to the difference between- p, and a negative quantity
greater than p; therefore it is essentially negative.
Since the first root is the sttm, and the second root the di Nrence
of the same two quantities, the first, or positive root, is greater
than the second, or negative root. See questions 11, 12, 13, 14,
page 206.
In the equation x2+2px=--q, or third form,
the two values of x are - p+V-q+p2
And                      --_p__-q-p2
If we examine the radical part, / -q+p2, we see, that its value
must be a quantity less than p, since the square root of p2 without
its being diminished, is p; hence, the first root is the difference
between -p, and a positive quantity less than p; therefore, it is
essentially nzegative.
If -we take the negative value of the radical part, the second
root is equal to the sum of two negative quantities; therefore, it
is essentially negative.

To what is the product equal? 217. Show that in the first form one of the

IIence, in the third form, both roots are negative. See questions 15, 16, 17, 18, page 206.
In the equation x2--2px=--q, or fourth form, the two values of
x are                  +p+    /- q-+p2
And                    +p-1/ -q+p
The value of the radical part, being the same as in the preceding form, it is less than p. The first root, then, is the sum of
two positive quantities, therefore, it is essentially positive.
The second root is the difference betweenp, and a negative
quantity less than p, therefore; it is essentially positive.
Hence, in the fourth form, both roots are'positive. See questions 19, 20, 21, 22, page 206.
ART. 21S.-In the third and fourth forms, the radical part is
/-q+p2. Now, if q is greater than p2, this is essentially negative, and we are required to extract the square root of a negative
quantity, which is impossible.  See Art. 195. Therefore, in the
third and fourth forms, when q is greater than p2, that is, when
the known term is negative, and greater than the square of half
the coefficient of the first power of x, both values of the unknown
quantity are impossible. What is the cause of this impossibility?
To explain-this, we must inquire into what two parts, a number must be divided, so that the product of the parts shall be the
greatest possible.
Let 2p represent any number, and let the parts, into which it is
supposed to be divided, be p+z and p--z. The product of these
parts is              (p+z) (p--)=p2 z'2.
Now, this product is evidently the greatest, when z2 is the least;
that is, when Z2 or z is 0. But, when z is 0, the parts are p and
p, that is, when a number is divided into two equal parts, their product is greater than that of any other two parts into which the number can be divided. Or, as the same principle may be otherwise
expressed, the product of any two unequal numbers is less thanl the
square of half' their sum.
As an illustration of this principle, take the number 10, and
divide it into different parts.
10=9+1, and 9X1=      9
10=8+2, and 8X2=16
10=7+3, and 7X3=21
10=6+4, and 6X4=24
10=5+5, and 5X5=25
RE VIE W.-217. Show that in the second form, one root is positive and the
other negative; and that the positive root is greater than the negative.
Show that in the third form, both roots are negative. Show that in the
fourth form, both roots are positive.
216EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE.                   217
We thus see, that the product of the parts becomes greater as
they approach to equality, and that it is the greatest when they
are equal'to each other.
Now, in Art. 215, it has been shown, that 2p, the coefficient of
the first power of x, is equal to the sum of the two values of x,
and that q is equal to their product. But, when q is greater than
2, we have the product of two numbers, greater than the square
of half their sum, which, by the preceding theorem, is impossible.
If, then, any problem furnishes an equation in which the known
term is negative, and greater than the square of half the co-fficient of the' first power of the unknown quantity, we infer, that
the conditions of the problem  are incompatible with each other.
The following is an example.
Let it be required to divide the number 12 into two such parts,
that their product shall be 40.
Let x and 12-x represent the parts.
Then                     x(12-x)=40, or x2--12x=--40
x2_l12x+36=--4
x-6-=-V-4, and x-6~=--4.
These expressions for the values of x, show that the problem is
impossible.  This we also know, from the preceding theorem,
since the number 12 can not be divided into any two parts, wvhose
product will be greater than 36; thus, the algebraic solution renders manifest the absurdity of an impossible problem.
R E M A R K S.----1St. When the coefficient of x2 is negative, as in the equation --x2+-l-;=nx, the pupil may not perceive that it is embraced in the four
general forms. This difficulty is obviated, by multiplying both sides of the
equation by -1.
2d. Since the sign of the square root of x2, or of (+-p)2, is i, -it might
seem, that when x2=m2, we should have:=x==t-ml, that is, +x==-tm,
and -x=~-4-n; such is really the case, but -x=+ m, is the same as
--x--=-m,7 and --x=--, is the same as +.x=-m.  Hence, +x--=nm,'
embraces all the values of x. In the same manner, it is necessary to take
only the plus sign of the square root of (x+p)2.

223RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
ART. 223.-Given, the first term  a, the common difference d,
and the number of terms n, to find s, the sum of the series.
If we take:an arithmetical series of which the first term is 3,
common difference 2, and number of terms 5, it may be written
in the following forms:
3,   3+2,   3+4,     3+6,     3+8
11,  l--2, 11--4, 11-6, 11-8.
It is obvious, that the sum of all the terms in either of these
lines; will represent the sum of the series; that is,
s= 3+( 3+2)+( 3+4)+( 3+6)+( 3+8)
Annd     s-=11+(11-2)+(11--4)+(11-6)+(11-8)                
Adding, 2s=14+ 14        + 14      + 14      + 14.
=14X the number of terms.
=14X5=70
Whence, s=-    of 70=35.
Now, let 1= the last term, then writing the series both in a
direct and inverted order,
s=a+(a+d)+(a+2d)+(a+3d)+...              +1
And       s-l-+(1--d)+(l-2d)+(l -3d)+.....+a
By adding the corresponding terms, -we have
2s=(1+a) + (li-a) (l7a)+-( 1a)        +(I+a)
-(l+a) taken as many times as there are terms (n) in
the series.
Hence, 2s=(l+a)n
s:(1a)2-- (--+2-) 1a
This formula gives the following
RULE,
FOR FINDING THE SUM OF AN ARITHMETICAL SERIES.
Multiply half the sum of the two extremes, by the number of terms.
From the preceding, it appears, that the sum oJ the extremes is
equal to the sum of any other two terms equally distantfrom  the
extremes.
R E I, A R K.-Since 1==a+(n-1)d, if we substitute this in the place of 1
in the formula s=-(l+a)2-, it becomes 8= ( 2a+(n1-l)d  2.  This gives

ART. 225.-By means of the preceding principle, we are enabled to solve the following problem.
Two.numbers, a and b, being given, to insert a number, m, of
arithmetical means between them; that is, so that the numbers
inserted, shall form, with the two given numbers, an arithmetical
series.
Regarding a and b as the first and last terms of an increasing
arithmetical series, if we insert m terms between them, we shall
have a series consisting of m+2 terms. But, by the preceding
principle, the common difference of this series will be equal to the
difference of the extremes divided by the number of terms less
b-a     b-a
one; that is, d=m+2-             therefore, the common difference
will be equal to the difference of the two numbers, divided by the number of means-plus one.
Let it be required to insert five arithmetical means between 3
and 15.
15-3
hIere d=     -=2; hence the series is 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15.
5+1
It is evident, that if we insert the same number of means between the consecutive terms of an arithmetical series, the result
will form a new progression. Thus, if we insert 3 terms between
the consecutive terms of the progression, 1, 9, 17, &amp;c., the new
series will be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and so on.

Let x=- the number of days required; then the distance traveled
by A in x days =a+2a+3a, &amp;c., to x terms, =--ax(x+l); and
the distance traveled by B in (x-4) days =9a(x-4).
Whence'ax(x+-1)=9a(x-4).    From which x=8, or 9.
Hence, B overtakes A at the end of 8 days; and since, on the'
ninth day, A travels 9a miles, which is B's uniform rate, they will
be together at the end of the ninth day. This is an instance of
the precision with which the solution of an equation points out

GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION.
ART. 226.-A    Geometrical Progression is a series of terms,
each of which is derived from the preceding, by multiplying it by
a constant quantity, termed the ratio.
Thus, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, &amp;c., is. an increasing geometrical series,
whose common ratio is 2.
Also, 54, 18, 6, 2, &amp;c., is a decreasing geometrical series, whose
common ratio is 3.
Generally, a, ar, ar2, ar3, &amp;c., is a geometrical progression, whose
common ratio is r, and which is an increasing or decreasintg series,
according as r is greater, or less than 1.
It is obvious, that the common ratio in any series, will be ascertained by dividing any term of the series, by that which immediately precedes it.
R E if A R K.-A geometrical progression is termed, by some writers, an
eqlirational series, or a series of continued propoortionals, or a pr)ogr8ession
by qllotielts.
ART. 227.-To find the last term of the series.
Let a denote the first term, r the common ratio, I the nth term,
and s the sum of n terms; then, the respective terms of the series

That is, the exponent of r in the second terni is 1, in the third

the series will be, lzz-ar - 1; that is,
Any term of a geometric series is equal to the produtct of the first

the number of terms.

ART. 22S.-To find the sum of all the terms of the series.
If we multiply any geometrical series by the ratio, the result
will be a new series, of which every term except the last, will
have a corresponding term in the first series.
Thus, let a, ar, ar2, ar3, &amp;c., be any geometrical series, and s its
sum, then  s=-a+ar+ar2 +ar73..... +arn"-2+arn-I
Multiplying this equation by r, we have
rs=ar+ar2+-ar3-+ar4.... +arn-l1+arn.
The terms of the two series are identical, except the Jirst term
of the first series, and the last term of the second series. If, then,
we subtract the first equation from the second, all the remaining
terms of the series will disappear, and we shall have
rs-s=arn-a
Or                   (r-1)s-- a(r"-1)

231:RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
RATIO AND PROPORTION.
ART. 231.-Two quantities of the same kind, may be compared in two ways:
1st. By finding how much the one exceeds the other.
2d. By finding how many times the one contains the other.
If we compare the numbers 2 and 6, by the first method, we
say that 2 is 4 less than 6, or that 6 is 4 greater than 2.
If we compare 2 and 6, by the second method, we say that 6 is
equal to three times 2, or that 2 is one third of 6.  This method of
comparison gives rise to proportion.
ART. 232.-Ratio is the quotient which arises from dividing
one quantity by another of the same kind.   Thus, the ratio of 2
to 6 is 3; the ratio of a to ma is nz.
RE rasK.-1st. In comparing two numbers or quantities by their
quotient, the number expressing the ratio which the first bears to the second, will depend on which is made the sta,dard of comparison. Thus, in
comparing 2 and 6, if we make 2 the unit of measure, or standard, we find,
that 6 is- three times the standard. If we make 6 the unit of measure, or
standard, we find, that 2 is one third of the standard. In finding the ratio
of one number to another, the French mathematicians always make thefirst
of the two numbers the standard of comparison; while the English make
the last named the standard. Thus, the French say the ratio of 2 to 6 is 3;
while the English say it is ~. The French method is now generally used
in the United States, though, in a few works, the other is still retained.
2d. In order that two quantities may be compared, or have a ratio to each
other, it is evidently necessary that they should be of the same kind, so that
one may be some part of, or some number of times the other. Thus, 2
yards has a ratio to 6 yards, because the latter is three times the former; but
2 yards has no ratio to 6 dollars, since the one can not be said to be either
greater, less, or any number of times the other.
ART. 233.-When two numbers, as 2 and 6, are compared, the
first is called the antecedent, and the second the consequent.
An antecedent and consequent, when spoken of as one, are
called a couplet.  When spoken of as two, they are called the terms
of the ratio. Thus, 2 and 6 together, form a couplet, -of which 2
is the first term, and 6 the second.
ART. 234.--Ratio is expressed in two ways.
1st. In the form  of a fraction, of which the antecedent is the
denominator, and the consequent the numerator. Thus, the ratio of
2 to 6, is expressed by 6; the ratio of 3 to 12, by l, &amp;c.
RrEVIEw.-231. In how many ways, may two quantities of the same
kind be compared? Compare the numbers 2 and 6 by the first method.
By the second. 232. What is ratio?  Give an illustration. 233. When
two numbers are compared, what is the first called? The second? Give
an example.
232RATIO AND PROPORTION.
2d. By placing two points (:) between the terms of the ratio.
Thus, the ratio of 2 to 6, is written 2: 6; the ratio of 3 to 8,
3: 8, &amp;c.
ART. 235.-The ratio of two quantities, may be either a whole
number, a common fraction, or an interminate decimal.
Thus, the ratio of 2 to 6 is 4, or 3.
The ratio of 10 to 4 is 4-, or ~.
- 1/5    2.236+
The ratio of 2 to /5 is --, or   2, or 1.118+.
We see, from this, that the ratio of two quantities can not
always be expressed exactly, except by symbols; but, by taking a
sufficient number of decimal places, it may be found to any required degree of exactness.
ART. 236.-Since the ratio of two numbers is expressed by a
fraction, of which the antecedent is the denominator, and the consequent the numerator, it follows, that whatever is true with regard
to a fraction, is true with regard to the terms of a ratio. IHence,
1st. l'o multiply the consequent, or to divide the antecedent of a
ratio by any number, multiplies the ratio by that number. (Articles
122, 125.)
Thus, the ratio of 4 to 12, is 3.
The ratio of 4 to 12X5, is 3X5.
The ratio of 4. 2 to 12, is 6, which is equal to 3X2.
2d. To divide the consequent, or to multiply the antecedent of a ratio
by any number, divides the ratio by that number. (Articles 123,
124.)
Thus, the ratio of 3 to 24, is 8.
The ratio of 3 to 24 -. 2, is 4, which is equal to 8$-2.
The ratio of 3X2 to 24, is 4, which is equal to 8-*-2.
3d. To multiply, or divide, both the antecedent and consequent of
a ratio by any number, does not alter the ratio.  (Articles 126, 127.)
Thus, the ratio of 6 to 18, is 3.
The ratio of 6X2 to 18X2, is 3.
The ratio of 6.-2 to 18 - 2, is 3.
ART. 237.-When the two numbers are equal, the ratio is said
to be a ratio of equality. When the second number is greater than
REVIEW. -234. When are the antecedent and consequent of a ratio
called a couplet? When the terms of a ratio? By what two methods is
ratio expressed? Give an example. 235. What forms may the ratio of two
quantities have? 236. How is a ratio affected by multiplying the consequent, or dividing the antecedent? Why?. How is a ratio affected by
dividing.the consequent, or multiplying the antecedent? Why? How is,
a ratio affected, by either multiplying or dividing both antecedent and
consequent by the same nimber? Why?

233RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
the first, the ratio is said to be a ratio of greater inequality, and
when it is less, the ratio is said to be a ratio of less inequality.
Thus, the ratio of 4 to 4, is a ratio of equality.
The ratio of 4 to 8, is a ratio of greater inequality.
The ratio of 4 to 2, is a ratio of less inequality.
We see, from this, that a ratio of equality may be expressed
by 1; a ratio of greater inequality, by a number greater than 1;
and a ratio of less inequality, by a number less than 1.
ART. 23S.-When the corresponding terms of two or more
iratios are multiplied together,.the ratios are said to be compounded,
and the result is termed a compound ratio. -Thus, the ratio 10,
compounded-with the ratio, is 40X-6=1~=4.    In this case, 3
multiplied by 5, is said to have to 10 multiplied by 6, the ratio
compounded of the ratios of 3 to 10 and 5 to 6.
ART. 239.-Ratios may be compared with each other, by reducing the fractions which represent them, to a common denominator. Thus, to ascertain whether the ratio of 2 to 5 is greater
than the ratio of 3 to 8, we have the two fractions, A and 8, which
being reduced to a common denominator, are i5 and 1e; and,
since the first is less than the second, we infer, that the ratio of 2
to 5 is less than the ratio of 3 to 8.
PROPOR TIO( N.
ART. 240.-Proportion is an equality of ratios. Thus, if a, b, c,
b           d
d are four quantities, such that b is equal to d,then a, 6, c, d form
a            c
a proportion, and we say that a is to b, as c is to d; or, that a has
the same ratro to b, that c has to d.
Proportion is written in two ways.
1st. By placing the double colon between the ratios. Thus,
a: b:: c: d.
2d. By placing the sign of equality between them. Thus,
a: b:=c: d.
The first method is the one generally used.
From the preceding definition, it follows, that when four quantities are in proportion, the second divided by the first, gives the
same quotient as the fourth divided by the third. This is the test
of the proportionality of four quantities. Thus, if 3, 6, 5, 10 are
REvrIw. -237. What is a ratio of equality? Of greater inequality?
Of less inequality? Give examples. 238. When are two or more ratios
said to be compounded? Give an example. 239. How may ratios be compared to each other? 240. What is proportion? Give an example. How
are four quantities in proportion written? Give examples.
234RATIO AND PROPORTION.
the four terms of a true proportion, so that 3: 6:: 5: 10, we
must have -=10.
If these fractions are equal to each other, the proportion is true;
if they are not equal to each other, it is false.
Thus, let it be required to find whether 3: 8::2: 5.
The first ratio is 8, the second is -, or 1X6, and?15; therefore,
3, 8, 2, 5 are not proportional quantities.
R E M A a K.-The words ratio and poopor'tionl, in common language, are
sometimes confounded with each other. Thus, two quantities are said to be
in the pjropor.tion of 3 to 4, instead of, in the ratio of 3 to 4. A ratio subsists between tlwo quantities, a proportion only between four. It requires
twoo eqltal ratios to form a proportion.
ART. 241.-In    the proportion a: b:: c: d, each of the quantities a, b, c, d, is called a term.  The first and last terms are
called the extremes, the second and third, the means.
ART. 242.-Of four proportional quantities, the first and third
are called antecedents, and the second and fourth, consequents (Art.
233); and the last is said to be a fourth proportional to the other
three, taken in their order.
ART. 243.-Three quantities are in proportion, when the first
has the same ratio to the second, that the second has to the third.
In this case, the middle term is called a mean, proportional between
the other two. Thus, if we have the proportion
a: b:: b: c
then b is called a mean proportional between a and c, and c is called
a third proportional to a and b.
ART. 244.-PR   OPOSlTION I.-In every proportion, thae product of
the means is equal to the product of the extremes.
Let                     a: b:: c:d.
Then, since this is a true proportion, the quotient of the second
divided by the first, is equal to the quotient of the fourth divided
by the third. Therefore, we must have
bd

Multiplying both sides of this equality by ac, to clear it of fracabc  adc
tions, we have                  Or, bc=ad.

and last terms of a proportion called?  The second and third terms?

From the equation bc=ad, we have d=-, c=-     b   -, and=
from which we see, that if any three terms of a pIroportion are
given, the fourth may be readily found.
The first three: terms of a proportion, are ac, bd, and acxy; what
is the fourth?                                       Ans. bdxy.
R E M A R K.--This proposition furnishes a more convenient test of the
proportionality of four quantities, than the method given in Article 240.
Thus, to ascertain whether 3: 8  2: 5, it is merely necessary to compare
the product of the means and the extremes; and, since 3X5 is not equal
to 8X2, we infer that the proportion is false.
ART. 245.-PROPOSITION II.-Conversely, If the product of two
quantities is equal to the produtct of two others, two of them may be
mzade the means, and the other two the extremes of a proportion.
Let                        bc=ad.
Dividing each of these equals by ac, we have
bc  ad       b  d
r----=  Or,ac  ac       a  c
That is,                 a: b:: c: d.
Illustration.  5X8=4X10, and 4: 5:: 8: 10.
ART. 246.-PROPOSITION III.-If three quantities are in continlted proportion, the product of the extremes is equal to the square of
the mean.
If                     a: b:: b: c
Then, by Art. 244,       ac-bb=b2.
It follows, from Art. 245, that the converse of this proposition
is also true. Thus, if     ac-b2,
Then,                     a: b::   c.
That is, if the product of the first and third of two quantities, is
eqtial to the square of a second, the first is to the seconzd, as the second
is to the third.

If                 - 2X8-1 6, then 2: v/16:: /16: 8

1. If x represents a certain number, what will represent one

To divide a number, we draw a line beneath it, under which we

read one half, or one divided by two. In the same manner, one half
of x would be written thus, 2; which may be read one half of x, or
x divided by 2.

4. If - is equal to 8, what is x equal to? If two thirds of x is
equal to 8, one third of x is equal to one half of 8, or 4 (since one
half of two thirds is one third); and if one third of x is equal to 4,
x is equal to three times 4, or 12.
Or thus: if 2x divided by 3 is equal to 8, 2x must be equal to
3 times 8, or 24; and if 2x is equal to 24, x is equal to one half
of 24, or 12.

CHAPTER I.
PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS' AND PRINCIPLES.
N oT TO TEA C U E R S.--In general, the Introduction, embracing Articles 1 to 15, need not be thoroughly studied until the pupil reviews the
book.
ARTICLE 1. In Algebra, numbers and quantities are represented
by symbols. These symbols are the letters of the alphabet.
ART. 2. Quantity is anything that is capable of increase or
decrease; such as numbers, lines, space, time, motion,. &amp;c.
ART. 3. Quantity is called magnitude, when presented. or considered in an undivided form, such as a quantity of water.
ART. 4. Quantity is called,zmultitude, when it is made up of individual and distinct parts, such as three cents, which is a quantity
composed of three single cents.
ART. 5. One of the single parts of which a quantity of multitude is composed, is called the unit of quantity, or measuring unit;
thus, one cent is the measuring unit of the quantity thre:e'cents.
The value or measure of every quantity, is the number of -times it
contains its measuring unit.
ART. 6. In quantities of magnitude, where there is no natural
unit, it is necessary to fix upon an artificial unit, as a standard of
measure; and then to find the value of the quantity, we m st
ascertain how often it contains: its- unit of measure.  Thus, to
measure the length of a line, we take a certain assumed distance
called a foot, and'applying it a certain number of times, say five,
we ascertain that the' line is five feet long; in this case,: one foot
is the unit of measure.
ART. 7. The numerical value of any quantity, is the number that
expresses how many times it contains its unit of measure. Thus,
in the preceding example, the line being 5 feet long, its numerical

value is 5; The same quantity may have different numerical
values, according -to the unit of measure that is assumed.
ART. S. A unit, is.a':single -or: whole thing of an order or kind.i
ART. 9. Number is an expression denoting a unit, or a collection of units. Numbers are either abstract or concrete..: X
ART.: 10. An abstract number denotes how many times a unit:t si
to be taken. A concrete, or applicate number, denotes.the uditsthat are.taken.
Thus, 4 feet is a concrete number; while 4 is an abstract number, which merely shows the number' of units -that are taken. A
concrete number may be defined to be the product of the.unit of
measure by the corresponding abstract number. Thus, 6 dollars
are-equal to 1 dollar multiplied by 6, or 1 dollar taken 6 times.
ART. 11. In Algebra, quantities are represented by numbers
and letters; the letters used; stand for numbers.
ART. 12. There are two kinds of questions in,Algbia, tor ems
and problems.                                 -       "~&amp;,',; r::

unknown number or' quantity, by means of certain given relations
bxisting between it and-others, which are known.:
AnT, 15. Algebra is a general method'of solving problems and
demonstrating:theorems,'by means::of figures, lette?s, and signs.
The letters and signs are sometimes called symbols.
DEFINITION OF TERMS, AND EXPLANATION OF'SIGNS.  
-ART,. 16l.: nown qtuantities are -those whose numerical values

they are used for the purpose of expressing the various operations,
in the most clear and brief manner.
ART. 19. The sign of equality,=, is read equal to. It denotes that.
the quantities between which it is placed are equal to each other.
Thus, a-3, denotes that the quantity represented by a is equal to 3.
ART. 20. The sign of addition, +, is read plus. It denotes that
the quantity to which it is prefixed, is to be added to some other
quantity.
Thus, a+b denotes that b is to be added to a. If a=2 and
b=3, then a+b-2+3, which are =5.
ART. 21. The sign of subtraction, -, is read minus. It denotes
that the quantity to which it is prefixed is to be subtracted. Thus,
a-b denotes that b is to be subtracted from a. If a=5 and b=3,
then 5-3=--2.
ART. 22. The signs + and - are called the signs; the former
is called the positive, and the latter the negative sign; they are
said to be contrary or opposite.
ART. 23. Every quantity is supposed to.be preceded by one or the
other of these signs. Quantities having the positive sign are called
positive; and those having the negative sign are called negative.
When a quantity has no sign prefixed to it, it is considered positive.
ART. 24. Quantities having the same sign are said to have like
signs; those having different signs are said to have unlike signs.
Thus, +a and +b, or -a and -b have like signs; while- +c and
-d have unlike signs.
ART. 25. The sign of multiplication, X, is read into, or-multi.
plied by. It denotes that the quantities between which it is placed,
are to be multiplied together.
A dot or point is sometimes used instead of the sign X. Thus,
aXb and a.b, both mean that b is to be multiplied by a. The dot
is not used to denote the multiplication of figures, because it is
used to separate whole numbers and decimals.
The product of two or more letters is generally denoted by
writing them in close succession. Thus, ab denotes the same as
aXb, or a.b; and abc means the same as aXbXc, or a.b.c.

VAN ANTWERP, BRAGG &amp; CO.,.,
137 WALNUT STREET,      28 BOND $S-TAREET",.-'::
CINCINNATI.            NEW YORK -RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
ART. 26. Quantities that are to be multiplied together, are called
factors. The continued product of several factors, means that the
product of the first and second is to be multiplied by the third, this
product by the fourth, and so on. Thus, the continued prodluct-of
a, b, and c, is expressed- by aXbXc, or abc.
If a=2, b=3, and c-5, then abc=2X3X5=6X55=30.
ART. 27. The sign of division, -, is read divided by. It denotes
that the quantity preceding it is to be divided by that following it.
The division of two quantities is more frequently represented, by
placing the dividend as the numerator, and the divisor as the denominator of a fraction. Thus, a. b, or b, means, that a is to
be divided by b. If a=-12 and b=3, then a   b=12. 3-4; or
a  12
b3     4.
Division is also represented thus, alb, where a denotes the
dividend, and b the divisor.'.-iART. 2S. The sign &gt;, is called the sign of inequality. It de-?i4nes that one of the two quantities between which it is placed, is
greater than the other, the openitg of the sign being turned
towards the greater quantity.
Thus, a&gt;b denotes that a is greater than b. It' is read, a greater
than b. If a-5, and b=3, then 5&gt;3.
Also, c&lt;d denotes that c is less than d. It is read, c less than.d.
If c:=4 and d=--7, then 4&lt;7.
ART. 29. The sign Go, denotes a quantity greater than,': -that
can be assigned; that is, a quantity indefinitely great, or infinity.,
ART.' 30. The numeral coefticient of a quantity is a number prefixed to it, to show how often the quantity is to be taken. Thus,
if the quantity represented by a is to be added to itself several
times, as a~a+a+a, we write it but once, and place a number
before it, to show how often it is taken.
Thus, a+a+a+a--4a; and ax+ax+axz=3ax.
*ART. 31. The literal coefficient of a quantity, is a quantity by
which it is multiplied. Thus, in the quantity ay, a may be considered the coefficient of y, or y may be considered the coMfficient of a.
The literal coificient is generally regarded as a known quantity.
REVIE.--26.. What are factors? How many factors in a? In ab?
In abc? In 5abe? 27. How is the sign -- read, and. what does it denote?
What other methods are there of representing the division of two quantities?
28. What does the sign of inequality, &gt;, denote? Which quantity is placed
at the opening.? 29. What does the sign m denote? 30. What is the numeral coefficient of a quantity? How often is a. taken in the expression
3ax? In 5ax? In 7ax? 31. What-is the literal eo6fficient of a quantity?
28DEFINITIONS AND       NOTATION.               29
ART. 33. The coefficient of a quantity may consist of a number,
and also of a literal part. Thus, in the quantity 5ax, 5a may be regarded as the coifficient of x. If a-2, then 5a=10, and 5ax--10x.
WVhen no numeral co'fficient is prefixed to a quantity, its coefficient is understood to be unity. Thus, a is the saime as Ia, and
bx is the same as Ibx.
ART. 33. The powoer of a quantity is the produAe arising from
multiplying the quantity by itself one or more times. When the
quantity is taken twice as a factor, the product is called its square,
or second power; when three tinmes, the culbe, or third power; when
four times, the fourth power, and so on.
Thus, aXa-aa, is the second power of a; aXaXa=aaa, is the
t7tird power of a; aXaXaXa--aaaa, is the fourth power of a.
Instead of repeating the same quantity as a factor, a small
figure, called an exponent, is placed to the right, and a little above
it, to point out the number of times the quantity is taken as a
factor. Thus, aa is written a2; aaa is written aS; aacaa is written
a4; aabbb is written a2b3.
When a letter has no exponent, it is considered to.be the first, or
sinmple power of the quantity, and unity is considered to be its exponent. Thus, a is the same as a', each expressing the first power of a.
ART. 34. To involve or raise a quantity to any given power, is
to find that power of the quantity.
ART. 35. The root of any quantity is another quantity, some
power of which- is equal to the given quantity. The root is called
thb nauare root. cube root, fourth root, &amp;c., according to the nuimber
of times it must be taken as a factor to produce the given quantity.
Thus, since aXa-a2, therefore a is the second root, or square
root of a2. In the same manner, x is the third root, or cube root
-of x', since xXxXx--x'.
- ART. 36. To extract any root of a quantity, is to find that root.
ART. 37. The sign V/, is called the radical sign. When placed
before a quantity it indicates that its root is to be extracted.
Thlus V/a, or V/a, denotes the square root of a; V'a, denotes
the cube root of a;  /ac denotes the fourth root of a.
ART. 38. The number placed over the radical sign is called the
inJdex of the root. Thus, 2 is the index of the square root, 3 of the
RE VIE.--32. When a quantity has no cocffieient written, what coefficient is understood? 33. What is the power of a quantity? What is meant
by the second power of a? By the third power of a? What is an exponent? For what is it used? How many times is x taken as, a factor in xz?
In x3? In x5? Where no exponent is written, what exponent is understood? 35. What is the root of a quantity? 37. What is the sign V/
called, and what does it denote?RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
cube root, 4 of the fourth root, and so on. When the radical has
no index over it, 2 is understood.
Thus, V/9-3, /l83=2, k/16-2.
ART. 39. Every quantity written in algebraic language, that is,
by means of algebraic symbols, is called an algebraic quantity, or
an algebraic expression. Thus,
3a is the algebraic expression of 3 times the number a; 3a-4b,
is the algebraic expression for 3 times the number a, diminished
by 4 times the number b; 2a2+3ab, is the algebraic expression for
twice the square of a, increased by 3 times the product of the
number a by the number b.
ART. 40. An algebraic quantitynot united to any otherby the sign
of addition or subtraction, is called a monomial; or a quantity of one
term, or simply a term. A monomial is sometimes called a simple
quantity. Thus, a, 3a, -a2b, 2any2, are monomials, or simple
quantities.
ART. 41. An algebraic expression composed of two or more
terms, is called a polynomial, or a compound quantity.
Thus, c+2d--b is a polynomial.
ART. 42. A polynomial composed of two terms, is called a
hilonmial. Thus, a+b, a-b, and c2--d are binomials.
A binomial, in which the second term is negative, as a-b, is
sometimes called a residual quantity.
ART. 43. A polynomial consisting of three terms, is called a
trinm:oial. Thus, a+b+c, and a-b-c are trinomials.
ARIT. 44. The numerical value of an algebraic expression is the
number obtained, by giving particular values to the -letters, and
then performing the operations indicated.
In the algebraic expression 2a+3b, if a=4, and b-5, then
2a-8, and 3b=15, and the numerical value is 8+15=23.
ART. 45. The value of a polynomial is not affected ly changing the order of the terms, provided each term retains its respective sign. Thus, a2+2a+b is the salime as b+a2+2a. This is
self-evident.
ART. 46. Each of the literal, factors of any simple quantity or
term is called a dimension of that term; and the degree of any
term depends on the number of its literal factors.
Thus, ax consists of two literal factors, a and x, and is of tho
second degree. The quantity a2b contains three literal factors, a, a,

and b, and is of the third deyr ee. 2a3x2 contains five literal factors,
a, a, a, x, and x, and is of the fifth degree; and so on.
ART. 47. A- polynomial is said to be homogeneous, when each
of its terms is of the same degree.
Thus, the quantity 2a-3b+c is of the first degree, and homogeneous; a2+3bc+xy, is of the second degree, and homogeneous;
x3-8ay2 is of the third degree, and homogeneous; a3+x' is not
homogeneous.
ART. 48. A parenthesis, ( ), is used to show that all the terms
of a compound quantity are to be considered together as a single
term.
Thus, 4(a-b) means that a-b is to be multiplied by 4; (a+x)
(a-x) means that a+x is to be-multiplied by a-x; 10-(a+c)
means that a+c is to' be subtracted from 10; (a-b)2 means that
a--b is to be raised to the second power; and so on.
ART. 49. A vinculutlI,, is sometimes used instead of a
parenthesis. Thus, a-bXx means the same as (a-b)x. Sometimes the vinculum is placed vertically, it is then called a bar.
Thus, a y2 has the same meaning as (a-x+4)y2.
-x
+4
ART. 50. Simnilar, or like quantities are those composed of the
same letters, affected with the same exponents. Thus, 7ab and
-3ab, also 4a3b2 and 7a3b2, are similar terms. The quantities
2a2b and 2ab' are not similar, for, though they are composed of
the same letters, yet these letters have different exponents.
ART. 51. The reciprocal of a quantity, is unity divided by that
1           1
quantity. Thus, the reciprocal of 2 is 2, and of a is -.
ART. 52. The same letter accented, is often used to denote
quantities which occupy similar positions in different equations or
investigations. Thus, a; a', a", a"', represent four different qualntities; of which a' is read, a prime; a" is read, a second; a"' is
read, a third, and so on.

ADDITION.:
ART. 53. ADDITION in Algebra, is the process of collecting two
or more algebraic quantities into one expression, called their sum.
CASE I.
When the quantities are siinlar, and have the same sign.
1. James has 3 pockets, each containing apples; in the first he~
has 3 apples, in the second 4 apples, and in third 5 apples.
In order to find how many apples he has, suppose he proceeds to
- find their sum in the following manner: 3 apples,
4 apples,
5 apples,
12 apples.
Suppose, however, that, instead of writing the word apples, he
should merely use the letter a, thus: 3a

RULE,
FOR ADDING SIMILAR QUANTITIES WITI-I LIKE SIGNS.
Add together the co'flicients of the several quantities, and to their
sumn annex the common letter, or letters, prefixing the common sign.
N o TE 1.-Let the pupil be reminded, that when a quantity has no coefficient prefixed, I is understood; thus, a is the same as la.
NOTE 2.-Let the pupil also be reminded, that the sum of any number
of quantities is the same, in whatever order they are taken. This is selfevident; but it may be illustrated by numbers in the following llmanner.
Suppose it is required to find the sum of the numbers 16, 25, and 34; in
adding these numbers together, they may be written in six different ways,
in each of which the sum is the same. Thus:
16       16        25         25        34        34

ART. 54L. When quantities are alike, butt have unlike signqs.
1. If James receives from one man 6 cents, from another 9
cents, and from a third 10 cents; and then spends, for candy 4
cents, and for apples 3 cents, how much money will he have left?
If the quantities he received be considered positive, then those
he spent may be considered negative; and the question is, to find
the sum of +6c, +9c, + 10c, -4c and -3c, which may be written
thus: +6c
+-9c   Here, it is evident, the true result will be foundbhy
+1 Oc adding the positive quantities into one sum, and the
-4e negative quantities into another, and then taking:
-3c  their difference. It is thus found that he received
+ 18c 25c, and spent 7c, which left 18c.
2. Suppose James should receive 5 cents, and then spend 7
cents, what sum would he have left?36            PAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.'
If we denote the 5c as positive, the 7c will be negative, and it is
required to find the sum of +5c and -7c.
In its present form, however, it is evident thaitthe question is
impossible. But if we suppose that James had a certain sum of
money before he received the 5c, we may inquire how much less
money he had after the operation, than before it; or, in other words,
what effect the operation had upon his money. The answer, it is
obvious, would be, that his money was diminished 2 cents; this
would be indicated by the sum of +5c and -7c, being -2c.
It is thus we say, that the sum of a positive and negative quantity is equal to the digftrence between the two; the object being to
find what the united effect of the two will be upon some third quan-.
tity. This may be further illustrated by the following example.
3. A merchant has a certain capital; during the year it is in,
creased by 3a and"8a dollars, and diminished by2a and 5a dollars;
how much will his capital be increased or diminished at the -close
of the year?
If we denote the gains as positive, the losses will be negative.
The sum of +3a, +8a, -2a, and -5a is 1 la-7a, which is equal
to +4a. Hence, we say, that the merchant's capital will be increased by 4a dollars; and whatever the capital may have been,
the result will be the same to increase it by 4a dollars, as first to
increase it by 3a and 8a dollars, and then to diminish it by 2a and
5a dollars. Had the loss been greater than the gain, the effect
would be to diminish the capital; and this would be indicated, by
the sum of the gains and losses being negative.
If the gain and loss were equal, it is evident the capital would
neither be increased nor diminished; or, in other words, if the
amount of the positive quantities was equal to that of the negative,
their sum would be 0. Thus, +3a-3a-0. If a=4, +3a-+12
and -3a=-12, and +12-12-0.
From this the pupil will perceive, that to add a negative quantity is the same as to subtract a positive quantity. In such cases,
the process of addition is called algebraic addition, and the sum is
called the algebraic s?um, to distinguish thlem from arithmetical
addition, and arithmetical sum. Hence, the
RULE,
FOR THE ADDITION OF QUANTITIES WHICH ARE ALIKE, BUT HAVE UNLIKE SIGNS.
Find the sum of the co'fflcients of the similar positive quantities;
also, the scum of the coifl'cients of the sitmilar negative quantities.
Subtract the 7ess. sumn from the greater; then, to the diference prefix
the sign qf the greater, and annex thle common literal part.ADDITION.                         37
4. What is the sum of +3a, -5a, +9a, --6a, and +7a?
Here, the sum of- the coefficients of the positive terms, is
3+9+7-=+19
The sum of the coefficients of the negative terms, is
- 5-6--11
The difference between 19 and 11 is 8, to which, prefixing the
sign of the greater, and annexing the literal part, we have for the
required sum +8a.
In practice, it is most convenient to write the  3a
different terms under each other. Thus,    -5a
9a
6a
7a
Sum--8a
Beginners, however, will sometimes find it easier  3a-5a
to arrange the positive quantities in one column,  9a-6a
and the negative in another. The preceding ex-  7a

other; what expression will represent the number in both?  If a
is represented by 3, and b by 4, then the number in both would be
represented by 3+4, or 7.
In the same manner, the number in both would be represented
by a+b; but unless the numerical values of a and b are given, it
is evidently impossible to represent their sum more concisely, than
by a+b.
In the same manner, the sum of the quantities a+b and c+d, is

If, in any expression, there are two or more like quantities, it is
obvious, that they may be reduced to a single expression by the

simplest expression for the difference between two algebraic
quantities.
In Algebra, as in Arithmetic, the quantity to be subtracted. is
called the sutbtrah-end. The quantity from which th-e subtraction
is to be made, is called the minuend. The quaintity left, after the
subtraction is performed, is called the diff-erence, or r-emainzder.

ART. 57.-1. Thomas has a number of apples, represented by
a; if he give away a quantity, represented by b, what expression
will represent the number of apples he has left?
If a represents 6, and b 4, then the number left would be represented by 6-4, which is equal to 2; and whatever numbers a
and b represent, it is evident that their difference may be expressed in. the same way, that is, by a-b.
Hence, to find the dsiference between two quantities that are not
similar, we place the signz minus before the quantity that is to be
szbtracted.
Let the pupil here notice again, that the sign of the quantity to
be subtracted, is changed from plus to minus.

If we subtract 5 from 9, the remainder will be 9-5; but we
wish to subtract, not only 5, but also 3; hence, after we have subtracted 5, we must also subtract 3; this gives for the remainder,
9-5-3, which is equal to 1.

If we subtract 5 frolll 9, the remainder will be 9-5; but tho
quantity to be subtracted is 3 less than 5, and we have, therefore,
subtracted 3 too much; we must, therefore, add 3 to 9-5, which
gives for the true remainder, 9-5+3, which is equal to 7.
3. Let it now be required to subtract b-c from a.
If we take b-from a, the remainder is a-b; but, in doing this,
we have subtralcted c too much; hence, to obtain the true result,
*we must add c. This gives, for the true remainder,.a-b+c.

Let it be noted, that in the result in each of the preceding examples, the signs of the quantity to be subtracted have been
changed from plus to rAinus, and from minus to plus; hence, in
order to subtract a quantity, it is merely necessary to change the

-:ART. 59. It is sometimes convenient to indicate the subtraction
of a polynomial without actually performing the operation. This
may be done, if it is a monomial, by placing the sign minus before
it; and, if it is a polynomial, by enclosing it in a;parenthesis, and
then placing the sign milus before it.
Thus, to subtract a-b from 2a, we may Write it 2a-(a-b),
which reduces to a+b.
By this transformation, the same polynomial may be written in
several different forms; thus:
a-b+c-d=a-b-(d-c)=a           d (b c)-a     (b- c+d).
Let the pupil, in each of the following examples, introduce all
the quantities, except the first, into a parenthesis, and precede it
by the sign minus, without altering the value of the expression.
1. a-b+c...........Ans. a-(b-c).
2. b+c--d...........                         Ans. b-(d-c).
3. X2--2xy-+z..........     Ans. x2-(2xy-z).
4. ax+-bc-cd+h.......... Ans. ax-(cd-bc-h).
5. m-n--z--s...............      Ans. m--(n+z+s).
6. nz-n+z+s............                   Ans. m--(n-z--s).
It will be found a useful exercise for the pupil, to take each of
the preceding polynomials, and without changing their values,
write them in all possible modes, by including either two or more
terms in a parenthesis.
OBSERVATIONS ON ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION.
ART. 60. It has been shown, that Algebraic Addition is the
process of collecting, into one, the quantities contained in two or
more expressions. The pupil has already learned, that these expressions may be all positive, or all negative, or partly positive and
partly negative. If they are either all positive, or all negative,
the sum will be greater than either of the individual quantities;
but, if some of the quantities are positive and others negative, the
aggregate mnay be less than either of them, or, it mayeven be

SUBTRACTION..RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
nothing. Thus, the sum of -+4a and -3a is a; while that of
+a and -a, is zero, or 0.
As the pupil should have clear views of the use and meaning of
the various expressions employed, it may be asked, what idea is'he
to attach to the operations of algebraic addition and subtraction.. ART. 61. In common or arithmetical addition, when we say,
that the sum of 5 and 3 is 8, we mean, that their sum is 8 greater
than 0. In algebra, when we say that 5 and -3 are equal to 2,
we mean, that the aggregate effect of adding 5 and subtracting 3,
is the same as that of adding 2. When we say, that the sum of
-5 and +3, is -2, we mean, that the result of subtracting 5,
and adding 3, is the same as that of subtracting 2. Some algebraists say, that numbers with a positive sign represent quantities
greater than 0, while those with a negative sign, such as -3,
represent quantities less than nothing. The phrase, less than nothing, however,, can not convey an intelligible idea, with any signification that would be attache.d to it in the ordinary use of language;
but, if we are to understand by it, that any negative quantity, when
added to a positive quantity, will produce aL result less than if
nothing had beein added to it; or, that a negative quantity, when
subtracted from a positive quantity, will produce a result greater
than if nothing had been taken fr-om it, then the phrase has a correct meaning. The idea, however, would be properly expressed,
by saying, that negative quantities are relatively less than zero.
Thus, if we take any number, for instance 10, and add to it the
numbers 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, and -3, we see, that -adding a
negative number produces a less result than adding zero..
10      10      10      10      10      10      10
3       2       1       0     -1      -2      -3
13      12      11      10       9       8      7
From this, we also see, that adding a negative number, produces
the same result, as subtracting an equal positive number.
Again, if we take any number, for exallple 10, and subtract
from it the numbers 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, and -3, we see, that
subtracting a negative number produces a greate? result than
subtracting zero:
10      10      10      10      10      10      10
3       2       1       0     -1      -2      -3
7       8-      9      10   11         12      13
From this, we also see, that subtracting a negative number, produces the same result, as adding an equal positive number.

either of them? - Whon is the sum equal to zero?
44OBSERVATIONS.                          45
ART. 62. In consequence of the results they produce, it is customary to say, of two negative algebraic quantities, that the least
is that which contains the greatest number of units. Thus, -3
is said to be less than -2. But, of two negative quantities, that
which contains the greatest number of units is said to be numerically the greatest; thus, -3 is numerically greater than -2.
AnT. 63. A correct idea of the nature of the addition of positive and negative quantities, may be gained by the consideration
of such questions as the following:
Suppose the sums of money put into a drawer to be positive
quantities, and those taken out to be negative; how will the
money in the drawer be affected, if, in one day, there are 20 dollars taken out, afterwards 15 dollars put in, after this 8 dollars
taken out, and then 10 dollars put in?  Or, in other words, what
is the sum of -20, +-15, -8, and +10? The answer, evidently,
is. -3; that is, the result of the whole operation diminishes the
amount of money in the drawer 3 dollars. Had the sum of the
quantities been positive, the result of the operation would have
been, an increase of the amount of money in the drawer.
Again, suppose latitude north of the equator to be reckoned +,
and that south, -; and that the degrees over which a ship sails
north, are designated by +, while those she sails over south, are
designated by -, and that we have the following question: A
ship, in latitude 10 degrees north, sails 5 degrees south, then 7
degrees north, then 9 degrees south, and then 3 degrees north;
what is her present latitude?
This question is the same as to find the sum of-the quantities
+10, -5, +7, -9, and +3; this is evidently +6; that is, the
ship is in 6 degrees north latitude. Had the sum of the negative
numbers been the greater, it follows, that the ship would have
been found in south latitude.Other questions of a similar nature may be used by the instructor,
to illustrate the subject.
ART. 64. Subtraction, in arithmetic, shows the method of finding the excess of one quantity over another of the same kind. In
this case, the number to be subtracted must be less than that finom
which it is to be taken; and, as they are considered without referRE viEW.-61.. What is meant, by saying that the sum of +5 and ~-3,

ence to sign, it is equivalent to regarding them of the same sign.
Algebraic Subtraction shows the method of finding the dJfl-rence
between two quantities which have either the same or unlike signs;
and it frequently happens, that this difference is greater than
either of the quantities. To understand this properly, requires a
knowledge of the nature of positive and negative quantities.
All quantities are to be regarded as positive, unless, for some
special reason, they are otherwise designated. Negative quantities embrace those that are, in their nature, the opposite of positive
quantities.
Thus, if a merchant's gains are positive, his losses are negative;
if latitude north of the equator is reckoned +, that south, would
be -; if distance to the right of a certain line is reckoned +,
then distance to the left would be -; if elevation above a certain
point, or plane, is regarded as +, then distance below would be
-; if time after a certa:in hour is +, then time before that hour
is -; if motion in one direction is -, then motion in an opposite
direction would be -; and so on.
With this knowledge of the meaning of the sign minus, it is
easy to see how the difference of two quantities having the same
sign, is equal to their difference; and also, how the difference of
two quantities having different signs, is equal to their sum.
1. One place is situated 10, and another 6 degrees north of the
equator, what is their difference of latitude?
Here we are required to find the difference between +10 and
*+6, which is evidently +4; by which we are to understand
that the first place is 4 degrees farther north than the second.
2. Two places are situated, one in 1 0, and the other in 6 degrees
south latitude; what is the difference of latitude?
Here we are required to find the difference between -6 and -10,
which is evidently -4, by which we learn, that the first place is
4 degrees farther south than the second.
3. One place is situated in 10 degrees north, and another in 6
degrees south latitude; what is their difference of latitude?
Here we are required to find the difference between +10 and -6,
or to take -6 from + 10, which, by the rule for subtraction, leaves
+ 16; which is evidently the difference of their latitudes, and from
which we learn, that the first place is 16 degrees farther north
than the other.
It is thus, when properly understood, the results are always
capable of a satisfactory explanation.

MULTIPLICATION.
ART. 65. MULTIPLICATION, in Algebra, is the process of taking
one algebraic expression, as often as there are units in another.
In Algebra, as in Arithmetic, the quantity -to be multiplied is
called the multiplicand; the quantity by which we multiply, the
multiplier, and the result of the operation, the product. The multiplicand and multiplier are generally called factors.
ART. 66. Since the quantity a, taken once, is represented by a,
when taken twice, by a+a, or'2a, when taken three times, by
a+a+a, or 3a, it is evident, that to multiply a literal quantity by
a number, it is only necessary to write the multiplier as the cofflicien,t
of the literal quantity.
1. If 1 lemon costs a cents, how many cents will 5 lemons cost?
If one lemon costs a cents, five lemons will cost five.times. as
much, that is 5a cents.
2. If 1 orange costs c cents, how many'cents will 6 oranges cost?
3. A merchant bought'a pieces of cloth, each containing b yards,
at c dollars per yard; how many dollars did the whole cost?
In a pieces, the nuinber of yards would be represented by ab,
or ba, and.the cost of ab yards at c dollars per yard, would be
represented by c taken ab times, that is, by abXc, which is represented by abc.
ART. 67. It is shown in " Ray's Arithmetic," Part III, Art. 44,
that the product of two factors is the same,.whichever be made
the multiplier; we will, however, demonstrate the principle here.
Suppose we have a sash containing'a vertical, and b horizontal
rows; there will be a panes in each horizontal row, and b panes
in each vertical row; it is required to find the number of panes in
the window.
It is evidont, that the whole number.of panes in the window
will be equal to the number in one row, taken as many times as
there are rows. Then, since there are a vertical rows, and b
panes in each row, the whole number of panes will be represented
by b taken a times, that is, by ab.
Again,. since there are b horizontal rows, and a panes in each
row, the whole number of panes will be represented by a taken b
times, that is, by ba. But, since either of the expressions, ba or

THE object of the study of Mathematics, is: two fold-theacquisition of useful knowledge, and the cultivation and discipline of
the mental powers. A parent often inquires,.":Why should my
son study mathematics? I do not expect him to be a surveyor, an
engineer, or an astronomer."  Yet, the parent is very desirous
that his son should be able to reason correctly, and to exercise,
in all his relations in life, the energies of a cultivated and disciplined mind. This is, indeed, of more value than the merc attainment of any branch of knowledge.  
The science of Algebra, properly taught, stands among the first.
of those studies essential to both the great objects of education.;
In a course of instruction properly arranged, it naturally fol:ws.
Arithmetic, and should be-taught immediately after it..'In the following work, the object has been, to furnish an elementary treatise, commencing with the first principles, and leading
the pupil, by gradual and easy steps,'to a knowledge of the.elements of the science. The design has been, to present these in a
brief, clear, and scientific manner, so that the pupil should not be
taught merely to perform a certain routine of exercises mechanically, but to understand;the why and the wherefore of every step.
For this purpose, every rule is demonstrated,.and every principle
analyzed, in order that the mind of the pupil may be disciplined
and:strengthened so as to prepare him, either for pursuing: the
study of Mathematics intelligently, or more successfully attending -
to any pursuit in life.
Some teachers may object, that this work is too simple, and too..
easily understood. A leading object has been, to make the pupil'feel, that he is not operating on unmieaning symbols, by means:of
arbitrary rules; that Algebra is both. a-ational and a practical
subject, and that he can rely upon his reasoning, and the res:uts3RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
ab, represents the whole number of panes in the window, they are
equal to each other, that is, ab is equal to ba. Hence, it follows,
that the product of two factors is the same, whichever be made the
multtoplier.
By taking a=3 and b=4, the figure in the margin may
be used to illustrate the principle in a particular case.
In the same manner, the product of three or more
quantities is the same, in whatever order they are taken.  f
Thus, 2X3X4=3X2X4--4X2X3, since the product            f
in each case is 24.
1. What will 2 boxes, each containing a lemons, cost at b cents
per lemon?
One box will cost ab cents, and 2 boxes will cost twice as much
as 1 box, that is, 2ab cents.
2. What is the product of 2b, multiplied by 3a?
The product will be represented by 2bX3a, or by 3aX2b, or by
2X3Xab, since the product is the same, in whatever order the
factors are placed. But 2X3 is equal to 6, hence the product
2bX3a is equal to Gab.
I-lence, we see, that in multiplying one monomial by another,
the coificient of the pproduct is obtained by nmultiplying to./ether the
co'7licients of the multiplicand and multiplier.  This is termed, the
7rule of the co.)ficients.
ART. 6S. Since the product of two or more factors is the same,
in whatever order they are written, if we take the product of any
two factors, as 2X3, and multiply it by any number, as 5, the
product may be written 5X2X3, or 5X3X2, that is, 10X3, or
15X2, either of which is equal to 30. From which we see, that'when either of the factors of a product is mnlultiplied, the plroduct
itself is multplied.

SIGNS.
ART. 72. In the preceding examples, it was assumed that the
product of two positive quantities, is also positive. It may, however, be shown as follows:
1st. Let it be required to find the product of +b by a.
The quantity b, taken once, is +b; taken twice, is evidently,
- +2b; taken 3 times, is +3b, and so on. Therefore, taken a timnes,
it is +ab. Hence, the product of two positive quantities is posi.
tive; or, as it may be more briefly expressed, plus multiplied by
plus, gives pluts.
2d. Let it be required to find the product of -b by a.
REVIE w.-To  what is the exponent of a letter in the product equal?

What is the product of a. plus b, by c? When all the terms in each are positive, how do you multiply a polynomial by a monomial? 71. When all
the terms in each are positive, how do you find the product of two polynomials?
51.MUL;TIPLICATION..~ RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
The quantity -b, taken once, is -b; taken twice, is -2b;
taken 3 times, is -3b; and hence, taken a times, is -ab; that is.
a negative quantity multiplied by a positive quantity, gives a inegative product. This is generally expressed, by saying; that minus
multiplied by plus, gives minus.
3d. Let it be required to multiply b by -a.
Since, when two quantities are to be multiplied together, either
may be made the multiplier (Art. 67), this is the same as to multiply -a by b, which gives -ab. That is, a positive quantity multiplied by a negative quantity, gives a negative product; or, more
briefly, plus multiplied by minus, gives minus.
4th. Let it be required to multiply -3 by -2.
The negative multiplier signifies, that the multiplicand is to be
taken positively, as many times as there are units in the multiplier, and then subtracted.  The product of -3 by +2 is -6,
then, changing the sign to subtract, the -6 becomes +6; and, in
the same manner, the product of -b by -a is +ab.
Hence, the product of two negative quantities is positive; or,
more lSriefly, minus multiplied by minus, gives plus.
N  T E.--The following proof of the last principle, that the product of
two negative quantities is positive, is generally regarded by mathematicians
as more satisfactory than the preceding, though it is not quite so simple.
The instructor can use either method.
5th. To find the product of two negative quantities
To do this, let us find the product of c-d by ac-b.
Here it is required to take c-d as many times as there are units in a-b.
It is obvious that this will be done by taking c-d as many times as there
are units in a, and then subtracting from this product, c-d taken as many
times as there are units in b.
$ince plus multiplied by plus gives plus, and minus multiplied by plus
gives minus, the product of c-d by a, is ac-ad.
In the same manner, the product of c-d by b, is bc-bdo; changing the
signs of the last product to subtract it, it becomes -bc+-bd; hence the pro.
duct of c--d by a-b, is ac-adcl-bc+bd.
But the last term, +bd, is the product of -d by -b, hence the product
of two negative quantities is positive; or, more briefly, mninus multiplied by
- m inus produces pltts.
The multiplication of c--d by a-b may be written thus:
c-d
\a-b
ac-ad=c-d taken a times.
-bc+-bd=c-d taken b times, and then subtracted.
ac-ad-bc+-bd
52MULTIPLICATION.
The operation may be illustrated by figures; thus, let it be required to
find the product of 7-4 by 5-3.
~  7-4        We first take 5 times 7-4; this gives a product too
5-3         great, by 3 times 7-4, or 21-12, which, being subtracted.35-20       from the first product, gives for the true result, 35-41+12A
-21+12     which reduces to +6. This is evidently correct, for 7--4
35-41+12     =3, and 5-3=2, and the product of 3 by 2 is 6.
From the preceding illustrations, we derive the following
GENERAL RULE,
FOR THE SIGNS.
Plus mtltiplied by plus, or minus multiplied by minus, gives plis.
Plus multiplied by minus, or minus multiplied by plus, gives minuts.
Or, theproduct of like signs gives plus, and of unlike signs gives minus.
From all the preceding, we derive the
GENERAL RULE,
FOR THE MULTIPLICATION OF ALGEBRAIC QUANTITIES.
Multiply every term of the multiplicand, by each term of the multiplier. Observing,
1st. That the co.fficient of any term is equal to the product of the
coefficients of its factors.
2d. That the exponent of any letter in the product is equal to the
sum of its exponents in the two factors.
3d. That the product of like signs, gives plus in the product, and
unlike signs, gives minus.  Then, addsthe several partial prodtlcts

DIVISION.
ART. 73. DIVISION in Algebra, is the process of finding how
often one algebraic quantity is contained in another.
Or, it may be defined thus: Having the product of two factors, and
one of them given, Division teaches the method of finding the other.
The number by which we divide, is called the divisor; the number to be divided, is called the dividend; the number of times the
divisor is contained in the dividend, is called the quotient.
ART. 74. Since Division is the reverse of Multiplication, the
quotient, multiplied by the divisor, must produce the dividend.
The usual method of indicating Division, is to write the divisor
under the dividend in the forml of a fraction. Thus, to indicate
ab
that ab is to be divided by a, we write,  Algebraic Division,
however, is sometimes indicated, like that of whole- numbers, thus,
a)ab; where a is the divisor, and ab the dividend.
NOTE TO TEA C HE R S.-In solving the following examples, let the

Solution,  ---a5-2b=3asb.
In obtaining this quotient, we readily see,
1st. The coffiicient of the quotient, must be such a number,
that when multiplied by 2, it shall produce 6; hence, to obtain it,
we divide 6 by 2.
2d. The exponent of a must be such a number, that when 2, the
exponent of a in the divisor, is added to it, the sum shall be 5;
hence, to obtain it, we must subtract 2 from 5; that is, 5-2 is
equal to 3, the exponent of a in the quotient.
3d. The letter b, which is a factor of the dividend, but not of
the divisor, must be found in the quotient, in order that the product
of the divisor and quotient may equal the dividend.
ART. 75. It remains to ascertain the rule for the signs.
-+ab
Since +a multiplied by +b=+ab, therefore,   =+a; hence,
plus divided by plus, gives plus.
ab
Since -a multiplied by +b=-ab, therefore, --+b  -a; hence,
minus divided by plus, gives minus.
Since +-a multiplied by -b=-ab, therefore, -ab-+a; hence,
minus divided by mizznus, gives plus.
+ab
Since -a multiplied by -b-+ab, therefore,  b=-a; hence,
pluts divided by minus, gives minus.
From this, we see, that in Division, like signs give plus, and
unlike signs give mintus.
Ihence the
RULE,
FOR DIVIDING ONE MONOMIAL BY ANOTHER.
Divide the co.fflicient of the dividend, by that of the divisor; observing, that like signs give phus, and unlike signs give minus.

this purpose, he is furnished, at almost every step, with the means
of testing the accuracy of the principles on which the rules are
founded, and of the results which they produce.
Throughout the work, the aim has been, to combine, the clear,
explanatory methods of the French mathematicians, with the practical exercises of the English'and German, so that the pupil should
acquire both a practical and theoretical knowledge of the subject.
While every page is the result of the author's own reflection,
and the experience of many years in the school-room, it is also
proper to state, that a large number of the best treatises on the
same subject, both English and French, have been carefully consulted, so that the present work might embrace the modern and
most approved methods of treating the various subjects presented.
With these remarks, the work is sul)bmitted to the judgment of
fellow laborers in the field of educations.

DIVISION OF ONE POLYNOMIAL BY ANOTHER.
ART. 79. To explain the method of dividing one polynomial by
another, we may regard the dividend as a product, of which the
divisor and the quotient are the two factors. We shall examine
the method of forming this product, and then, by a reverse operation, explain the process of division.
Multiplication, or formation of a product.  Division, or decomposition of a product.
2a2-ab                          2aS-3a2b+ab2la-b
a-,b                          2a3-2a2b      2a2-ab
- 2a3-a2b               1st. rem.  -a2b+ab2
-2a2b+ab                        -a2b+ab2
2a3-3a2b+ab2            2d. rem.          0
If we multiply 2a2-ab by a-b, and arrange the terms according
to the powers of a, we shall find the product to be 2a3-3a2b+ab2.
In this multiplication we remark,
1st. Since each term in the multiplicand is multiplied by each
term in the multiplier, if no reduction takes place in adding the
several partial products together, the number of terms in the final
product will be equal to the number produced by multiplying together the number of terms in the two factors. Thus, if one factor have 3 terms, and. the other 2, the number of terms in the
product will be six. Frequently, however, a reduction takes place,
by which the number of terms is lessened. Thus, in the above
example, two terms being added together, there are only 3 terms
in the product.
2d. In every case of multiplication, there are two terms which
can never be united with any other. These are, first: that term
which is the product of the two terms in the factors, which contain
the highest power of the same letter; and second: the term which
is the product of the two terms in the factors, which contain the
7owest power of the same letter.
From the last principle it follows, that if the term containing
the highest powver of any letter in the dividend, be divided by the
term containing the highest power of the same letter in the divisor,
59
DIVISION.RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
the result will be the term of the quotient containing the highest power of that letter. Hence, if 2a3 be divided by a, the result,
2a2, will be the term containing the highest power of a, in the
quotient.
The dividend expresses the sum of the partial products of the
divisor, by the different terms of the quotient. If, then, we form
the product of the divisor by the first term, 2a2, of the quotient,
and subtract it from the dividend, the remainder, -a2b+ab2, will
be the sum of the other partial products of the divisor, by the
remaining terms of the quotient.
Now, since this remainder is produced, by multiplying the divisor by the remaining terms of the quotient, it follows, as in the
method of obtaining the first term of the quotient, that if the term
containing the highest power of a particular letter in this remainder, be divided by the term containing the highest power of the
same letter in the divisor, the quotient will be the term containing
the highest power of that letter in the remaining terms of the
quotient.
Hence, if -a2b be divided by a, the quotient, -ab, will be another term of the quotient. Multiplying the divisor by this second
term, and subtracting, we find the second remainder is 0; hence,
the exact quotient is 2a 2-ab. Had there been a second remainder, the third term of the quotient would have been obtained from
it in the same manner as the second term was obtained from the
first remainder.
Since each term of the quotient is found, by dividing that term
of the dividend containing the highest power of a particular letter,
by the term of the divisor containing the highest power of the same
letter, it is more convenient to place the terms of the dividend and
the divisor, so that the exponents of the same letter shall either
increase regularly, or diminish regularly, from the left to the right.
This is termed, arranging the dividend and divisor, with reference to
a certain letter. The letter with reference to which a quantity is
arranged, is called the letter of arrangement.
The divisor is placed on the right of the dividend, because it is
more easily multiplied by the respective terms of the quotient, as
they are found.
From the preceding, we derive the
RULE,
FOR THE DIVISION OF ONE POLYNOMIAL BY ANOTHER.
Arrange the dividend and divisor, with reference to a certain letter,
and place the divisor on the right of the dividend.
60DIVISION.
61
Divide the first term of the dividend by the first term of the divisor,
the restult will be the first term of the quotient.  Multiply the divisor
by this term, and subtract the product from the dividend.
Divide thefirst term of the remainder by the first term of the divisor, the reszlt will be the second term of the quotient.  Multiply the
divisor by this term, auld subtract the product from  the last remaibnder.
Proceed in the same manner, and if yot obtain 0 jbr a remainder,
the division is said to be exact.
R E Mr A R K S.-lst. It is not absol8utely necessary to arrange the dividend
and divisor with reference to a certain letter; it should always be done,
however, as a matter of convenience.
2d. The divisor may be placed on the le't of the dividend, instead of the
right, as directed in the rule. When the divisor is a monomial, it is more
convenient to place it on the left; but, when it 1s a polynomial, to place it
on the right.
3d. If there are more than two terms in the quotient, it is not necessary
to bring down any more terms of the remainder, at each successive subtraction, than have corresponding terms in the quantity to be subtracted.
4th. It is a useful exercise for the learner, to perform the same example
in two different ways. First, by arranging the dividend and divisor, so
that the powers of the same letter shall dimninish from left to right; and,
secondly, so-that the powers of the same letter shall increase from left to
right.
5th. It is evident, that the exact division of one polynomial by another
will be impossible, when the first term of the arranged dividend is not
exactly divisible by the first term of the arranged divisor; or, when the first
term of any of the remainders is not divisible by the first term of the
divisor.

ART. 94.---To separate a quantity which is the product of two
or more polynomials, into its prime factors.
No general rule can be given, for this case. When the given quantity
does not consist of more than three terms, the pupil will generally be able
to accomplish it., if he is familiar with the theorems in the preceding section.
1st. Any trinomial can be sepalrated into two binomialfactors,
when the extremes are squares and positive, and the nliddle term
is twice the product of the square roots of the extremes. See
Articles 79 and 80.
Thus: a2+2ab+b2=(a+b) (a+b).
a---2ab~b2-(a-b)(a-b).
2d. Any binomial, which is the difference of two squares, can
be separated into two factors, one of which is the sum, and the
other the difference of the roots. See Art. 81.
Thus: a2- b2-=(a+-b)(a-b).
3d. When any expression consists of the difference of the
same powers of two quantities, it can be separated into at least
two factors, one of which is the difference of the quantities. See
Art. 84.
Thus: am--bm=(a- b) (am-q-+am-2b.....     +abm-2+bm-1),
where a, b, and nm, may be any quantities whatever.
In this case, one of the factors being the difference of the quantities, the other will be found by dividing the given expression by
this difference. Thus, to find the other factor of a3-b3, divide by
a-b, the quotient will be found to be a2+ab+b2; hence, as-b3
-(a--b)(a2+ab+b2).
70In a similar manner, a5 -b5   ( a-b) (a 4+a3b+a2b2+ab3+b 4).
4th. When any expression consists of the difference of the even
powers of two quantities, higher than the second degree, it can
be separated in-to at least three factors, one of which is the silun,
and another the difference of the quantities. See Articles 85
and 86.
Thus, a 4-b 4is exactly divisible by a+b, according to Article
86; and, according to Article 85, it is exactly divisible by a-b;
hence, it is exactly divisible by both a+b anid a-b; and the othier
factor will be found by dividing by their product. Or, it may be
separated into fatctors, according to paragraph 2d, above, thus:
a*4-b _(a +2(a -b2      (a2~b2)(a~b)(a-b),
5th. When any expression consists of the sum of the odd powvers of two quantities, it may be separated into at least two factors,
one of.which is the sunm of the quantities (See Art. 86). The
other factor w ill be found, by dividiDn, the given expression by
this sum. ThuIS, we know that a3-jb3, is exactly divisible by a+b,
and by division, we find the othier factor to be a2-ab+b; hence,
a3+b3=-(a+b)( a2-ab+b 2).

ART. 96.-The principal use of factoring, is to shorten the
work, and simplify the results of algebraic operations.  Thus,
when it is required to multiply and divide by algebraic expressions, if the multiplier and divisor contain a common factor, it mlay
be canceled, or left out in both, without affecting the value of the
result. Thus, if it is required to multiply any quantity by a2--b2,
aild then to divide the product by a+b, the result will be the same
as to multiply at once by a-b.
Whenever there is an opportunity of canceling common factors,
the operations to be performed should be merely indicated, as the
common factors will then be more easily discovered. The pupil
will see the application of this principle, -by solving the following
examples.
1. Multiply a-b by x2+2xy+y2, and divide the product by x+y.

quantities. Thus, 2 is a common divisor of 8 and 12; and a is

greatest, both with regard to the coefficients and exponents, is
called their greatest common divisor, or greatest common measure.
Thus, the gre~atest common divisor of 4a2xy and 6a3z2y2 is 2a2xy.
ART. 990-Quantities that have a common divisor, are said to
be commensurable; and those that have no common divisor, are
said to be incommensutrable. Incommensurable quantities are also

ART. 100.--To find the greatest common divisor of two or more

1. Let it be required to find the greatest common divisor of the
two monomials, 6ab and 15a2c.
By separating each quantity into its prime factors, we have
6ab-=2X3ab, 15a2c=3X5aac.
Here we see, that 3 and a are the only factors common to both
terms; hence, both the quaftities cam be exactly divided, either
by 3 or a, or by their product 3a, and by no: other quantity
whatever; consequently, 3a is theilr;~'eatest common divisor.

ART. 101.-To find the greatest common divisor of two polynomials.,
First. Let AD and BD be either two monomials, or polynomials,
of which D is a common divisor; and let AD be greater than BD.
74GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR.
Divide AD by BD; then, if it gives an exact quotient, BD must
be the greatest common divisor, since no  BD)AD(Q
quantity can have a divisor greater than      BDQ
itself. But, if BD is not contained an exact
number of times in AD, suppose it is con-     A-BDQ=R
tained Q times with a remainder, which may be called R. Then,
since the remainder is found, by subtracting the product of the
divisor by the quotient, from the dividend, we have R=AD-BDQ.
Dividing both sides by D, we get R-A-BQ; But A and BQ are
R
each entire quantities; hence D, which is equal to their difference,
must be an entire quantity.  Hence, it follows, that any comnmon
divisor of two qtuantities, woill always exactly divide their remainder
after divisions. And, since the greatest common divisor is a common divisor, it follows that the greatest common divisor of two
quantities, will always exactly divide their remainder after division.
RE Al! A R K.-In the above article, we have used two axioms, which may
be new to somie pupils. They are, -first: If two equal quantities be divided
by thte same qvuanltity, t7h.eir quotients wiill he equral. Alnd, second:  T1he
difference of two entire qua),tities is also ain entire quanltity. The pupil can
easily see, that the sum, or difference of two whole numbers must also be
a whole number; and, that the same is likewise true of two entire quantities. This, and the next article will both be better understood by the
pupil, after he has studied simple equations.
ART. 102.-Second. Suppose, now, that it is required to find
the greatest common divisor of two polynomials, A and B, of
which A is the greater.

be the greatest co'mmon divisor sought.
7576            RAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
Suppose, however, that when we divide R into B, to ascertain
if it will exactly divide it, we find that the quotient is Q', with a
remainder, R'. Now, it has been shown, that whatever exactly
divides twotuantities, will divide their remainder after division;
then, since the greatest common divisor of A and. B, has been
shown to divide B and R, it will also divide their remainder R',
and can not be greater than Rf. And, if R' exactly divides R, it
will also divide B, since B=RQ'+R'; and whatever exactly.divides
B and R, will also exactly divide A, since A-BQ+-R; therefore,
if R' exactly divides R, it will exactly divide both A and B, and
will be their greatest common divisor.
In the same manner, by continuing to divide the last divisor by
-the last remainder, it may always be shown, that the greatest common divisor of A and B will exactly divide every new remainder,
and, of course, can not be greater than either of them. It may,
also, always be shown, as above, in the case of R', that any
remainder, which exactly divides the preceding divisor, will also
exactly divide A and B. Then, since the greatest common divisor
of A and B can not be greater than this renmainder, and, as this
remainder is a common divisor of A and B, it will be their greatest common divisor sought.
To illustrate the same principle by numbers, let it be required
to find the greatest common divisor of 14 and 20.
If we divide 20 by 14, and there is no remain- 14)20(1
der, 14 is, evidently, the greatest common divisor,  14
since it can have no divisor greater than itself.  6)14(2
Dividing 20 by 14, we find the quotient is 1, and    12
the remainder 6, which is, necessarily, less than
either of the quantities, 20 and 14; and by the         6
theorem, Article 98, it is exactly divisible by their
greatest common divisor; hence, the greatest common divisor
must divide.20, 14, and 6, and cannot be greater than 6. Now,
if 6 will exactly divide 14, it will also exactly divide 20, since
20=14+6, and will be the greatest common divisor sought.
But when we divide 6 into 14, to ascertain if it will exactly
divide it, we find that the quotient is 2, with a remainder, 2; then,

by the preceding theorem., the greatest common divisor of 14 and
6 will also divide 2, and therefore, can not be greater than 2.
Now, if 2 will exactly divide 6, it will, also, exactly divide 14,
since 14=6X2+2; and whatever will exactly divide 6 and 14,
will also divide 20. But 2 exactly divides 6; hence it is the
greatest common divisor of 14 and 20.
ART. 103.-When the remainders decrease to unity, or when
we arrive at a remainder which does not contain the letter of
arrangement, we conclude that there is no common divisor to the
quantities.
ART. 104.-If one of the quantities contains a factoiPnot found
in the other, it may be canceled without affecting the common
divisor (see example 3); and if both quantities contain a common
factor, it may be set aside as a factor of the common divisor; and
we may proceed to find the greatest common divisor of the other
factors of the given quantities.  This is self-evident. See Example 2.
ART. 105.--We may multiply either quantity, by a factor not
found in the other, without affecting the greatest common divisor.
2abx
Thus, in the fraction 3-b the greatest common divisor of the
two terms, is evidently ab. Here, we may cancel- the factors 2
and x in the numerator, or 3 and c in the denonminator, without
ab
affecting the common divisor; for the common divisor of 3'  or
2abx
of 2, is still ab.
ab
If we multiply the dividend by 4, a factor not found in the divi8abxi
sor, we have 8b-, of which the common divisor 0 still ab.
3abc'
In the same manner we may multiply tht- div oy  any factor
not found in the dividend, and the common divisor will still remain
the same.
If, however, we multiply the numerator by 3, which is a factor
6abx
of the denominator, the result is  of which the greatest comr3abc'
mon divisor is 3ab, and not ab as before. Hence, we see, that the
greatest common divisor will be changed, by multiplying one of
the quantities by a factor of the other.
REVIE w.-102. Show, that by dividing the last divisor by the last
remainder, the greatest common divisor of two polynomials will exactly
divide both the first and second remainders after division.

viRAY'S ALGEBRA, PART FIRST.
ART. 106.-In the general demonstration, Art. 101, it has been
shown, that the greatest common divisor of two quantities, also
exactly divides each of the successive remainders; hence, the preceding principles apply to the successive remainders that arise, in
the course of the operations necessary to find the greatest common
divisor.
The preceding principles will be illustrated by some examples.
1. Find the greatest common divisor of x3-y3 and x4-x2y2.
Here the second quantity contains x2 as a factor, but it is not a
factor of the first; we may, therefore, cancel it, and the second
quantity becomes x2-_y2. Divide the first by it.
After dividing, we find that y2 is a factor of the
remainder, but not of x2_y2, the dividend. Hence,
by canceling it, the divisor becomes x-y; then, dividing by this, we find there is no remainder; therefore x-y is the greatest common divisor.
X3-y3 x2_-y2
X3-xy2     (X
xy2--y3
or, (x--y)y2

this, the quiantities become X4+t-3x and x2-a2.    a2x+a2
The first quantity still contains a common factor, x, or, (x+a)a2
which the latter does not; canceling this, it be- x2-a2  Ix+a

In solving this example,
there are two instances in
which it is necessary to
multiply the dividend, in
order that the co-fficient of
the first term may be exactly divisible by the divisor. See Art. 105. The
greatest common divisor
is found to be 2a2+-3x2.

RULE,
FOR FINDING THIIE GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR OF TWO POLYNOMIALS.
1st. Divide the greater polynomial by the less, and if there is no
remainder, the less quantity will be the divisor sought.
2d. If there is a renmainder, divide the first divisor by it, and continue to divide the last divisor by the last remainder, until a divisor
is obtained, which leaves no remainder; this will be the greatest commzon divisor of the two given polynomials.

NOTE S. -1.L When the highest power of the leadinlg letter is the same
in both, it is immaterial which of the quantities is made the dividend.
2. If both quantities contain a common factor, let-it be set aside, as forming a factor of the common divisor, and proceed to find the greatest common divisor of the remaining factors, as in Example 2.
3. If either quantity contains a factor not found in the other, it may be
canceled, before commencing the operation, as in Example 3. See Art. 104.
4. Whenever it becomes necessary, the dividend may be multiplied by
any quantity which will render the first term exactly divisible by the divisor. See Art. 105.
5. If, in any case, the remainder does not contain the leading letter, that
is, if it is independent of that letter, there is no common divisor.
6. To find the greatest common divisor of three or more quantities, first
find the greatest common divisor of two of them; then, of that divisor and
one of th6 other quantities, and so on. The last divisor thus found, will be
the greatest common divisor sought.
7. Since the greatest common divisor of two or more quantities contains
all the factors common to these quantities, it may be found most easily by
separating the quantities into factors, where this can be done, by means of
the rules in the preceding article.

LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE.
ART. 107.-A qnultiple of a quantity is that which coiitains it
exactly. Thus, 6 is a multiple of 2, or of 3; and 24 is a multiple of 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.; also, 8a'b3 is a multiple of 2a, of 2a, of 2a b,
&amp;c.; and 4(a-x)y2 is a multiple of (a-x), of 2y, of 4y2, &amp;c.
ART. 1OS,.-A- quantity that contains two or more quantities
exactly, is a common multiple of them.   Thus, 12 is a colmon:
multiple of 2 and 3; and 6ax is a common multiple of 2, 3, a,:and- x.LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE.
ART. 109.-The least common multiple of two or more quantities, is the least quantity that will contain them exactly. Thus,
6 is the least common multiple of 2 and 3; and 1Oxy is the least
common multiple of 2x and 5y.
REr ARK.-Two or more quantities can have but one least common
multiple, while they may have an unlimited number of common mllultiples.
Thus, while 6 is the least commlon multiple of 2 and 3, any multiple of 6,
for instance, 12, 18, 24, &amp;c., will be a common multiple of these numbers.
ART. 1 IO.-To find the least common multiple of two or more
quantities.
It is evident, that one quantity will not contain another exactly,
unless it contains the same prime factors. Thus, 30 does not exactly contain 14, because 30=2X3X5, and 14-2X7; the primeo
factor 7, not being one of the prime factors of 30.
ART. II.-Any quantity will contain another exactly, if it
contains all the prime factors of that quantity. Thus, 30 contains 6 exactly, because 30=2X3X5, and 6-2X3; the prime
factors 2 and 3 of the divisor, being also factors of the dividend.
IIence, in order that one quantity shall contain another exactly, it
is only necessary that it should contain all the prime factors of
that quantity. Moreover, in order that any quantity shall exactly
contain two or more quantities, it must contain all the different
prime factors of those quantities. And, to be the least quantity
that shall exactly contain them, it should contain these different
prime factors only once, and no other factors besides. Hence,
the least combmon multiple of two or more quantities, contains all the
different prime factors of these qzuantities onlce, and does not contain
any other factor.
Thus, the least common multiple of a2bc and acx, is a2bcx, since
it contains all the factors in each of these quantities, and does not
contain any other factor.
With this principle, let us find the least common multiple of ax,
bx, and abc.
a ax bx abc      Arranging the quantities as in the margin, we
Z x bx bx      see, that a is a factor common to two of the
terms; hence it must be a factor of the least
b 1 b     bc   common multiple, and we place it on the left
1 1     c   of the quantities. We then cancel this factor
in each of the quantities in which it is found, which is done by
dividing by it.  By examining the remaining factors, it is seen
that x is a common factor in the first and second terms. We then
place it on the left, and cancel it in those terms in which it is

found. We next see, that b is a factor common to two of the quantities; hence, as before, we place it on the left, and cancel it in
those terms in which it is found. We thus find., that a, x, b, and
c, are all the prime factors in the given quantities; therefore, their
product, abex, will be the least common multiple of these quantities. lIence, the
RULE,
FOR FINDING THE LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE OF TWO OR MORE
QUANTITIES.
1st. Arrange the quantities in a horizontal line, and divide then.
by a?y prime factor that will divide two or mnore of themz without a
remlainder, anzd set the quotients, together with the lundivided quantities, in ca liine beneath.
2d. Continue dividing as before, unttil zno primne factor, except
unity, will divide two or mnore of the quantities, without a remzainder.
3d. Mdultilly the divisors and the quantities in the last line together,
anld the product wvill be the least common multiple required.
Or, separate the given quantities i7nto their prifize factors, and then
multiply together, such, of those factors as are necessary to form a
product that will contain all the prime factors in each quantity; this
product ioill be the least commion multiple required.
ART. 1 t2.-Since the greatest common divisor of two quantities, contains all the factors common to them, it follows, that if
we divide the produlct of two quantities, by their greatest commzon
divisor, the quotient will be their least com7zmon mqultiple.

ART. l120.-Algebraic fractions are represented in the same
manner as co11mm0on fractions in Arithmetic.  The number or
quantity below the line, is called the denoninator, because it denominzates, or shows the number of parts into which the unit is
divided; and the number or quantity above the line, is called the
0numer1zator, becaluse it numbers, or shows how many parts are taken.
Thus, in the fraction, 4-, the denominator, 4, shows, that the unit
(for instance, 1 foot,) is divided into 4 equal parts, and the numerator, 3, shows, that 3 of these parts are taken. Again, in the
fraction -, the denominator c, shows, that a unit is divided into c
equal ptarts, and a shows, that a of these parts are taken.
The numerator and denominator, are called the terms of a
fraction.
ART. 121.--In the pieeding definitions of numerator and denominator, reference is had to a unzit only. This is the simplest
method of considering a fraction; but there is another point of
view, in which it is proper to examine it.
If it be required to divide 3 apples equally, between 4 boys, it
can be effected, by dividing each of the 3 apples into 4 equal
parts, and then giving to each boy 3 of those parts, expressed by
4. Now, the parts being equal to each other in size, it will be the
same, for an individual to receive 3 parts fromn 1 apple, or 1 part
from each of thg 3 apples; that is, 3 of one apple, is the same as, of 3 apples; or, 4 of 1 unit, is the same as - of 3 units. Thus,
-  may be regarded as expressing two fifths of onze thing, or oine
fifth of twoo things.

N o T E T o T E A C H E R S.-Although it is important that the pupil should
be perfectly fatmiliar with the principles contained in the following propositions, the demonstrations may be omitted, especially by the younger class
of pupils, until the book is reviewed.
PROPOSITION        1.
ART. 122.--If we zzmultiply the numerator of afraction, woithoutt
changing the denominator, the value of the fractionz is increased as
mnany times as there are units in the multiplier.
If we multiply the numerator of the fraction a by 3, without
changing the denominator, we get 6. Thus:
2X3    6
7  7
Now, 27 and 7 have the same denominator, and, therefore express parts of the same size; but the second fraction, 1, has three
times as large a numerator as the first, 7; it therefore expresses
three times as many of those equal parts as the first, and is, consequently, three times as large. And the same may be shown of
any fraction whatever.
PROPOSITION        11.
ART. 123. -.If use divide the numerator of a fraction, without
changing the denominator, the valute of the fraction is diminished,
as many times as there are utnits in the divisor.
If we take the fraction 4, and divide the numerator by 2, without changing the denominator, We get 2. Thus:
4 -2   2
5      5
Now, 4 and 2 have the same denominator, and, therefore, express parts of the same size; but the numerator of the second
fraction,:, is only one half as large as the numerator of the first,
4; it therefore expresses only one half as many of those equal
parts as the first, and is, consequently, only one half as large.
Andi the same may be shown of other fractions.

PROPOSITION VI.
ART. 127.-Dividing both terms of a fraction by the same number or quantity, changes the form of the fraction, but does not alter
its value.
If we divide the numerator of a fraction by any number, its
value (by Prop. II.) is decreased, as many times as there are units
in the divisor; and if we divide the denominator, the value (by
Prop. IV.) is increased, as many times as there are units in the
divisor. Hence, if both terms of a fraction are divided by the
same number, the decrease from dividing the numerator is equal
to the increase from dividing the denominator; consequently, the
value remains unchanged.

ART. 128.-Since the value of a fraction is not changed by
dividing both terms by the same quantity (See Art. 127), we have

INTELLECTUAL EXERCISES.
LESSON -I.
N o E T E TO. TE ACH. -All the. exercises in the following lessons can.
be solved in the same imanner as in intellectual arithmetic; yet the instructor should require the pupils to perform them after the manner here indicated. In every question let the answer be verified.
1. I have 15 cents, which I wish to divide between William
and Daniel, in such a manner, that Daniel shall have twice as
many as William; what number must I give to each?
If I give William a certain number, and Daniel twice thnat number, both will have 3 times that certain number; but both together
are to have 15 cents; hence, 3 times a certain number is 15.
Now, if 3 times a certain number is 15, one-third of 15, or 5`
must be the number. Hence, William received -5 cents, and Daniel twice 5, or 10 cents.
If, instead of a Sertain number, we represent the number of cents
William is to receive, by x, then the number Daniel is to receive
will be..represented by 2x, and what both receive will be repre
sented by x added to 2x, or 3x.
If 3x is equal to 15,
then lx or x is equal to 5.
The learner will see that the two methods of solving this question are the same in principl'e; but that it is more convenaint to
represent the quantity we wish to find, by a single letter, than by
one or more words.
In the same manner, let the learner continue to use the: lette'r:x
to represent the smallest of the required numbers in the followi::

ART. 1311.--1.  In 21 how many thirds?
In 1 unit there are 3 thirds; hence, in 2 units, there are twice

FOR REDUCING A MIXED QUANTITY TO THE FORM OF A FRACTION.

add the numerator wit/h its proper sign to the product, and place the
result over the denominator.
R E 31 A RK.-Cases II. and III., are the reverse of, and mutually prove
each other.
Before proceeding further, it is important for the learner to
consider
THE SIGNS OF FRACTIONS.
ART. 132.-- It has been already stated (See Art. 121,) that in
every fraction the numerator is a dividend, the denominator a
divisor, and the value of the fraction the quotient. The signs prefixed to the terms of Ia fraction, affect only those terms; and the
sign placed before a fraction, affects its whole value. Thus, in the
a2 b2
fraction- x-, the sign of a2, the first term of the numerator,
is plus; of the second, b2, minus; while the sign of each term of
the denominator, is plus. But the sign of the fraction,- taken as
a whole, is minus.
By the rule for the signs in Division, Art. 75, we have
+ab                                             -ab
+a=a+b; or, changing the signs of both terms, -a +b.
+a                                           -a
--ab
But, if we change the sign of the numerator, we have  --b.
-ab
And, if we change the sign of the denominator, we have  ---b.
-a
Hence, the signs of both terms of a fraction may be changed,
without altering its value, or changing its sign; but, if the sign of
either term of a fraction be changed, and not that of the other, the
sign of the fraction will be changed.
90REDUCTION OF FRACTIONS.
From this, it also follows, that the signs of either term of af';action may be changed, withoult altering its value, if the si9gn of' tzhe
Jfiaction be changed at the same time.

Here, we are at liberty to multiply both terms of each fraction,
by the same quantity, since this (See Art. 126) will not change
its value. Now, if -re multiply both terms of each fraction, by
the denominators of the other two fractions, the new denominators in each will be the same, since, in each case, they will consist
of the product of the same factors, that is, of all the denominators.

M_tltiply both terms of each fraction by the product of all the

RE MARK.--Since each denominator of the new fractions, will consist
of the product of all the denominators of the given fractions, it is unnecessary to perform the same multiplication more than once.

ART. 1134.-It frequently happens, that the denominators of
the fractions to be reduced, contain one or more common111111011 factors.
In such cases, the preceding rule does not give the least common
denominator. From the preceding Article we see, that the common denominator is a multiple of all the denominators; and, that
each numerator is multiplied by a quantity which is equal to the
quotient obtained, by dividing this multiple by its denominator.
Thus, in the second example, nr, mr, and ain, the quantities by
which each numerator is respectively multiplied, may be regarded
as the quotients obtained, by dividing mn?n successively, by in, n,
and r. Now, if we obtain the least common multiple of tlle denominators, by the rule, Case III., and then divide it by each
denominiator respectively, and multiply the quotients by the numerators respectively, we shall dbtain a new class of firactions,
equivalent to the former, and having for a common denonlinator,
the4least common multiple of the given denominators. It is easily
seen, that both terms of each fraction are multiplied by the same
quantity, and hence, that the resulting fractions are equivalent to
the given ones.
1. Reduce -b, -, and -d' to equivalent fractions, having the
least comllmol denominator.
The least common multiple of the denominators is easily found
to be bcd; dividing this by b, the denominator of the first fraction,
the quotient is ed; then multiplying both terms of b by cd, the
mzcd
result is....                           bed.

The process of multiplying the denominators by the quotients
may be omitted, as the product in each case will be equal to the
least common multiple. Hence, the
RULE,
FOR REDUCING FRACTIONS OF DIFFERENT DENOMINATORS, TO EQUIVALENT FRACTIONS, HAVING THE LEAST COMMON DENOMINATOR.

ART. 135.-To reduce an entire quantity to the form of a fraction having a given denominator.
1. Let it be required to reduce a to a fraction having b for its
denominator.
Since any quantity may be reduced to the form of a fraction,
a
by writing 1 beneath it, a is the same as 1; if we multiply both
terms by b, which will not change its value (See Art. 126), we
have a  ab

1. Reduce b to a fraction, whose denominator is bc.
It is evident, that the terms must be multiplied by the same
quantity, so as not to change the value of the fraction. It is then
required to find, what the denominator, b, must be multiplied by,
that the product shall become bc; but, it is evident, this multiple will be found, by dividing bc by b, which gives the quotient, c.
Then, multiplying both terms of the fraction - by c, the result is
b-' which is equal to the given fraction a, and has, for its denominator bc. Hence, the
RULE,
FOR CONVERTING A FRACTION TO AN EQUIVALENT ONE, HAVING A

fraction, and multiply both terms by the quotient.:R Er M A R ai.-This rule is perfectly general, but it is never applied, except
where the required denominator is a multiple of the given one. In other
cases, it would produce a complex fraction. Thus, if it is required to convert 4 into an equivalent fraction, whose denominator is 5, the numerator
of the new fraction would be 2i.

add the numerators together, and place their sum over the common
denominator.
ART. 138.--It is obvious, that the same principles would apply,
if it were required to find the difference between two fractions;
that is, if their denominators were the same, the. numerators might
be subtracted; buit, if their denominators were different, it would
be necessary to reduce them to the same denominator, before performing the subtraction. Hence, the
RULE,
FOR THE SUBTRACTION OF FRACTIONS.
Reducce the fractions, if necessary, to a common denominator;
then subtract the numerator of the fraction to be subtracted from the
numerator of the other, and place the remainder over the common
denominator.
