IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776.
The Uncatnimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States
of.imerica.
WiHEN in the course of human events, it becomes
necessary for one people to dissoive the political bands
which have connected thlem  withl another, and to assume, amontg the powers of the earth, the separate and
equal station to which the laws of nature antd of nature's
God entitle thelm, a decent respect to the opinions of
mankind requires that they should declare the causes
which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident:-that all mtnen
are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights: that among tihese
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  That to
secure these rights, governments are instituted among
men, deriving their just powers fromn the consent of the
governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the riglit of the
people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new go.
verniment, laying its foundation on such principles, and
organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall
seemr most likely to effect their safety and hlappiness.
Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long
established should not be changed for lighit and transient
causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that
mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are suf.
ferable, than to rilght themselves by abolishing the forms
to which they are accustomed.  But whlen a long train
of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same
object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute
despotisn), it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off
2in levying war against it, or in adhering to the enemies
of the government, giving them aid and comafort. No
person shall be convicted of treason), unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on
confession in open court.

adequate salaries, to be fixed by law, which shall not

suclh government, and to provide new guards for their
fiuture security.  Such has been the patient sufferanice
of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which
constrains them to alter their former systems of government.  The history of the present king of Great Britain, is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all
having in direct object the establishment of an absolute
tyranny over these states.  To prove this, let facts be
submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome
and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in thleir
operation, till his assent should be obtained; and when
so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
lIe has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those pleople
woul(l relinquish the right of representation in the legislature-a right inestimable to them, and formidable
to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the repository of
their public records, foe the sole purpose of fatiguing
themn into compliance with hismeasures,
He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly,
for opposing, with mnanly firmness, his invasions on the
rights of the people.
HIe has refused, for a long timte after such dissolutions,
to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative
powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the
people at large, for their exercise, the state remaining,
in the mean time, exposed to all the dangers of invasion firom without, and convulsions within.
HIe has endeavoured to prevent the population of
these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for
naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others to
encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.
He has obstructed the administration of justice, by

unless their commissions shall sooner expire by their
own limitations, or the said offices shall become vacant
by death or resignation, and no longer, unless re-appointed and commissioned by the governor.

CONSTITUTION OF MARYLAND.@
ThFe Declaration of Rights, and the constitution and

TIIE DECLARATION OF RIGIGHTS.
The parliament of Great Britain, by a declaratory
act, having assumed axright to make laws to bind the
colonies in all cases whatsoever, and in pursuance of
such claim, endeavoured, by force of arms, to subjugate
the united  colonies to an unconditional submission to
their will and power, and having at length constrained
them to_ declare themselves independent states, and to
assumne government under the authiority of the people:
-Therefore,
* SuLch parts of the original constitution, or the amenldments
thereto as have been altered or abolished, are printed in italicsa.
CONSTITUTION
t~10We, the delegates of Maryland, in free and full convention assembled, taking into our most serious consideration the best means of establishing a good constitution in this state, for the sure foundation and more
permanent security thereof, declare:
1. That all government of right originates from the
people, is founded in compact only, and instituted solely
for the good of the whole.
2. That the people of this state ought to have ithe sole
and exclusive right of regulating the internal government and police thereof.
3. That the inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to
the common law of England, and the trial by jury, according to the course of that lawv, and to the benefit of
such of the English statutes; as existed at the time of
their first emigration, and which, by experience, hlave
been found applicable to their local and other circunstances, and of such others as have been since made ina
England, or Great Britain, and have been introduced,
used, and practised by the courts of Jaw or equity; and
also to all acts of assembly, in force on the first of June,
seventeen hundred and seventy-four, except suchI as may
have since expired, or have been, or may be, altered by
acts of convention, or this dleclaration of rights-subject, nevertheless, to the revision of, and amendmnent or
appeal by, the legislature of this state: and the inhlabitants of Maryland are also entitled to all property derived to them from or under the chlarter granted by his
majesty Charles I. to Camciliuas Calvert, baron of Ba]l
timore.
4. That all persons invested with the legislative or
executive powers of governmeht, are the trustees of the
public, and, as such, accountable for their conduct;
wherefore, whenever the ends of government are perverted, and the public liberty manifestly endangered,
and all other means of redress are ineffectual, the people
may, and of right ought to reform the old, or establish
a new government. The doctrine of non-resistance
~                 F11;
OF MARYLAND,
12l- C ONSTITUTION
against arbitrary power and oppression is absurd, slavishb
and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind.
5. That the right, in the people, to participate in the
legislature, is the best security of liberty, and the foundation of all free goverinment; for this purpose, elections
ought to be free and- - frequent, and every man having
property in, a common interest with, and an attachment
to, the community, ouglht to have a right of suffrage.
6. That the legislative, executive and judicial powers
of governminent, ought to be forever separate and distinct
from each othler.
7. That no power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, untless by) or derived from, the legislature,
ought to be exercised or allowed.
8. That freedom of speech and debate, or proceedings, in the legislature, ought not to be impeached in any
other court of judicature.
9. That a place for the meeting of the legislature
ought to be fixed, the most convenient to the mnembers
lthereof, and to the depository of the public records; and
the legislature ought not to be convened or held at any
other place, but tfromt evident necessity.
10. That, tor redress of grievances, and for amending, strengthening, and preserving the laws, the legislature ought to be frequiently convened.
11. That every man hath a righlt to petition the legislature, for the redress of grievances, in a peaceable
and orderly mananer.
12. That no aid, clharge, tax, burthen, fee or fees,
ought -to be set, rated, or levied, under any pretence,
without consent of the legislature.
13. That the levying taxes by the poll is grievous
and oppressive and oughlt to be abolishedcl: that paupers
ought not to be assessed for the support of government;
but every other person in the state ought to contribute
hIlis proportion of public taxes, for the support of government, according to his actual worth, in real or personal property, within the state; yet fines, duties, or
taxes, may properly and justly be imposed or laid, with
122political view, for the good government and benefit of
the community.
14. That sanguinary laws ought to be avoided, as far
as is consistent with the safety of the state; and no law
to inflict cruel and unusual pains and penalties ought to
be made in any case, or at any time hereafter.
15. That retrospective laws, punishing facts committed before the existence of such laws, and by them only
declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust, and incompatible with liberty; wherefore, no ex postfacto law ought
to be made.
16. That no law to attaint particular persons of treason or felony, ought to be made in any case, or at any
time hereafter.
17. That every freeman, for any injury done him in
his person or property, ought to have remedy, by the
course of the law of thie land, and ought to have justice
and right, freely, without sale, fully, without any denial,
and speedily, without delay, according to the law of the
land.
18. That the trial of facts wlhere they arise is one of
the greatest securities of the lives, liberties, and estates
of the people.
19. That, in all criminal prosecutions, every man hath
a right to be informed of the accusation against him; to
have a copy of the indictment or charge in due time (if
required) to prepare for his defence; to be allowed counsel; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to
have process for his witnesses; to examine the witnesses
for and against him, on Oath; and to a speedy trial by art
impartial jury, without whose unanimous consent he
ought not to be found guilty.
20. That no man ought to be compelled to give evi.
delce against himself, in a court of common law, or in
any other court, but in such cases as have been usually
practised in this state, or may hereafter be directed by
the legislature.
21. That no freeman ought to be taken, or imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties, or privileges,
123
OF MARYLAND.or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner destroyed, or
deprived of his life, liberty, orproperty, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.
22. That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor
excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishments inflicted by the courts of law.
23. That all warrants, without oath or affirmation, to
search suspected places, or to seize any persons or property, are grievous and oppressive; and all general warrants, to search suspected places, or to apprehend suspected persons, without inaming or describing the place
or the persons in special, are illegal anid ought not to be
granted.
24. That there ought to be no forfeiture of any part
of the estate of any person, for any crime except mniurder, or treason against thle state, and then only on conviction and attainder.
25. That a well regulated militia is the proper and
natural defence of a free governDment.
26. That standing armaies are dangerous to liberty,
and ought not to be raised or kept up without consent of
the legislature.  
27. That, in all cases and at all times, the military
ought to be under strict subordination to, and control of
the civil power.
28. That no soldier ought to be quartered in any
house in time of peace, withlout the consent of the owner;
and in time of war in such manner only as the legislature shall direct.
29. That no persons, except regular soldiers, mariners, and marines ill the service of this state, or militia
when in actual service, ought in any case to be subject
to, or punishable by, martial law.
30. That the independency and uprightness ofjudges
are essential to the impartial administration of justice,
and a great security to the righlts and liberties of the people; wherefore, the chancellor and judges ought to hold
commnissions during good behaviour; and the said chancellor and judges shall be removed for misbehaviour on

124OF MARYLAND.                   125
conviction in a court of law, and may be removed by
the governor, upon the address of the general assembly:
provided that two thirds of all the members of each
house concur in such address. That salaries, liberal,
but not profiuse, ought to be secured to the chancellor
and the judges during the continuance of their commnissions, in such manner, and at such times, as the legislature shall hereafter direct, upon consideration of the circumstances of this state. No chancellor or judge ought
to hold any other office, civil or military, or receive fees
or perquisites of any kind.
31. That a long continuance in the first executive department of power or trust, is dangerous to liberty; a
rotation, therefore, in those departments, is one of the
best securities of permanent freedom.
32. That no person ought to hold, at the same time,
more than one office of profit, nor ought any person in
public trust to receive any-present from any foreign prince
or state, or from the United States, or any of them, without the approbation of this state.
33. That, as it is the duty of every man to worship
God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to
him, all persons professing the christian religion are
equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty;
wherefore, no person oughlt by any law to be molested
in his person or estate, on account of his religious persuasion or profession, or fobr his religious practice; unless, under colour of religion, any man shall disturb the
good order, peace or safety of the state, or shall infringe
the laws of morality, or injure others in their natural,
civil, or religious rights: nor ought any person to be compelled to frequent or maintain, or contribute, unless on
contract, to maintain any particular place of worship or
any particular ministry; yet the legislature may, in their
discretion, lay a general and equtal tax for the sutpport of
the christian religion; leaving to each individual the power
of appointing the payment over of the money, collectedfr om
him to the support of any particular place of worship or
minister, orfor the benefit of the poor of his own denomif126                 CONSTITUTION
nation,; or the poor in general of any particular county:
but tlhe churches, chapels, glebes, and all other property,
now belolnging to the church of England, ought to remain to the church of England forever. And all acts of
assembly lately passed, for collecting monies for build.
ing or repairing particular churches or chapels of ease,

minister, public teachler, or preacher of the gospel, as
suchb or to any religious sect, order, or denomination, or
to or for the support, use, or benefit of, or in trust for,
any minister, public teacher, or preacher of the gospel,
as such, or any religious sect, order, or denomrination;
and every gift or sale of goods or chattels, to go in suc.
cession, or to take place after the death of the seller or
donor, to or for such support, use or benefit, and also
every devise of goods or chattels to or for the support,
use, or benefit of any minister, public teacher, or preacher of the gospel, as such, or any religious sect, order, or
denomination, without the leave of the legislature, shall
be void, except always any sale, gift, lease, or devise-of
any quantity of land not exceeding two acres, for a
church, meetina, or other house of worship, ac d for a
burying ground, which shall be improved, enjoyed, or
uised only for such purpose, or such sale, gift, lease, or
devise, shall be void.
35. That no other test or qualification ought to be required, on admission to any office of trust or profit, than
such oath of support and fidelity to this state, and such
oath of office, as shall be directed by this contvention or
the legislature of this state, and a declaration of a belief
in the christian religion.
36. That the manner of administering an oath to any
person ought to be such as those of the religious persuasion, profession, or denomination, of which such person is one, generally esteem the most effectual confirmation by the attestation of the divine Beinig; and that
the people called quakers, those called tuikers, and
those called menonists, holding it unlawful to take an
oath on any occasion, oughit to be allowed to make their
solemn affirmationl in the manner that quakers have
been heretofore allowed to affirm; and to be of the
same avail as an oath in all such cases as the affirmation of quakers hath been allowed and accepted within
this stale instead of an oath. Anid further, on such affirmation, warrants to search for stolen goods, or the apprehension or commitment of offenders ought to be

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt
our towns) and d(lestroyed( the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporti,ng large armnies of foreign
mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation,
and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy, scarcely paralleled( in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized
nation.
He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive
on the high seas, to bear arms against their country, to
become the executioners of their friends and brethren,
or to fall themselves by their hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us,
and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our
fi'ontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known
rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all
ages, sexes, and conditions.
In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the mnost humble terms: our repeated
petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.
A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act
which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a
free people.
Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British
brethren.  We have warned them, from time to timne,
of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.  We have reminded them of
the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.
We have appealed to their native justice and magnaniinity, and we have conjured themn by the ties of our
commnon kindred to disavow these usurpations, which
would inevitably interrupt our connexions and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of'justice and of consanguinity. We must therefore, acquiesce
in the necessity whlich denounces our separation, and
hold them, as we hold the rest of mnankind-enemnies in
war, inll peace friends.

against all offences the people are led to forget the real
distinction in the crimes themselves, and to commit the

sanguinary laws are both impolitic and unjust; the true
design of all punishments being to reform, not to exterminate mankind.

CONSTITUTION OF NEW JERSEY.
WHEREAS all the constitutional authority ever possessed by the kings of Great Britain over these colonies,* or their other dominions, was, by compact, derived from the people, and held of themn, for the common
interest of the whole society; allegiance and protection
are, in the nature of things, reciprocal ties, each equally depending upon the other, and liable to be dissolved
by the others being refused or withdrawn: And whereas
George the Third, king of Great Britain, has refused
protection to the good people of these colonies; and by
assenting to sundry acts of the British parliament, attempted to subject them to the absolute dominion of that
body; and has also made war upon them, in the most
cruel and unnatural mannter, for no other cause thant asserting their just rights-all civil authority under him
is necessarily at an end, and a dissolution of government
in each colony has consequently taken place.
And whereas in the present deplorable situation of
these colonies, exposed to the fury of a cruel and relentless enemy, some form of government is absolutely necessary, not only for the preservation of good order, but
also the more effectually to unite the people, and enable

defence: and as the honourable the continental congress, the supreme council of the American colonies, has
advised such of the colonies as have not yet gone into

government as shall best conduce to their own happiness
and safety, and the well being of America in general:We, the representatives of the colony of New Jersey,

and liberty, of acquiring, possessing, and protecting pro.
perty and reputation, and of pursuing their own happiness.
2. That all power is inherent in tile people; and all
free governments are founded on their authority, and
instituted for their peace, safety and happiness.  For
the advancement of those ends, they have, at all times;
an unalienable and indefeasible right to alter reform or
abolish their government, in such mannier as they may
think proper.
3. That all men have a natural and indefeasible right
to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of
their own consciences: and no man can, of right,- be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship,
or to maintain any ministry, against his consent; that no

free communication of thoughts and opiniois is one of
the invaluable rights of man: and every citizen may
freely speak, write, and print on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.  In prosecutions
for the publication of papers investigating the official
conduct of officers, or men in public capacity, or where
the matter published is proper for public information,
the truth thereof may be given in evidence. And, in all
indictments for libels, the jury shall have a right to determinie the law and the facts, under the direction of the
court, as in other cases.

probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.

hath a right to be heard by himself and his counsel: to
demand the nature and cause of the accusation against
him: to meet the witnlesses face to face: to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favour;
and, in prosecutions by indictment or information, a
speedy, public trial, by an impartial jury of the vicinage~

himself, nor can he be deprived of his life, liberty, or
property, unless by the judgment of his peers, or the law
of the land.

be proceeded against criminally by information, except
89CONSTITUTION
in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia when in actual service, in time of war or public
danger, or, by leave of the court, for oppression and
misdemeanor in office. No person shall, for the same
offence, be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor

use, without the consent of his representatives, and without just compensation being made.

for an injury done himn in his lands, goods, person, or reputation, shall have remedy by the due course of law,
and right and justice administered without sale, denial

as the legislature may by law direct.

13. That excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel punishments inflicted.

strong presumption of fraud, shall not be continued in

felony by the legislature.

vest as in case of natural death; and if any person shall
be killed by casualty, there shall be no forfeiture by reason thereof.
20. That the citizens have a right in a peaceable manner, to assemble together for their common good, and to
apply to those invested with the powers of government
for redress of grievances, or other proper purposes, by
petition, address, or remonstrance.
21. That the righlt of the citizens to bear arms in defence of themselves and the state, shall not be questioned,
