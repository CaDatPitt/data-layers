or "rat; 'i‘E‘aR.ESTRiIAL GLOBE.

The terrestrial globe is a representation of
the earth, having the seas and (liﬁerent coun.
tries depicted on it, exactly as they are on the
surface of the earth.

The spindle on which the globe turns is
called its axis 5 but in nature this axis is only

i imaginary.

The extreme points of the axis are called the
poles; the one is the north, or arctic, the other
the south, or antarctic.

Ancient and modern geographers agree in
dividing the earth into FIVE ZONES, namely,
one torrid, two temperate, and two frozen
zones. . '

' The torrid zone extends from the equator

to the tropic of Cancer northward, and to the

tropic of Capricorn southward, including 23-2‘:
degrees on each side of the equator, malsiing in
the whole forty-seven tlegrccs.

T he two temperate zones lie between the
tropics and polar circles, on each side of the
equator, being t'orty..three degrees each :l and

' ‘he two frigid zones embrace the regions
frorn the polar circles to the poles, ‘extending
in each direction 23% degrees. '

The earth is supposed to be surrounded with
several imaginary circles, which are actually
drawn on the artiﬁcial globe, or expressed" by
Wooden or brass work. .

The equator is a supposed circle of the earth,
